B0091ICDHU|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  The author covers all of the emotions- I laughed out loud and cried like a baby.  I love reading books that make you do this.  I read both this one and the follow-up - Point of Retreat in one weekend.  I didn't want to put them down.

B0002VFXFE|3.0|I have tried many brands of thermal paste/compounds for multiple cooling systems and this is by far the best at heat dissipation and it doesn't cook off after 100 hours as most pastes/compounds dry up and flake away after extended use.<br /><br />Update: So it has been a few months and have run into the same issue with this thermal compound as others. It can not stand up to overclocked temps and If you plan to overclock i suggest Antec formula 7 nano diamond thermal compound. you can find it at your local Staples or Best Buy for about $15 bucks
B009NPKTN6|4.0|ROA was definitely not a blockbuster but it told a really feel good story and had some awesome tunes in it (sung by the actual actors - !!!).  I would revisit this movie on occaision and that's not the norm for me...

B002MQYOFW|5.0|OMG!!! I love the Hunger Games, it is one of the best books I have read, it may be the best!!! It was so addicting and I couldn't put it down. Each turn you took in it it was either a heart breaking moment or a suspenseful moment were someone was killed or survived a deadly battle. I can't put this book into words so all in all is was....AMAZING!!!!!! :)

B009DA74ES|3.0|I think all fans can agree that Season 1 & 2 of Californication are by far the best. There was something more than<br />just sex & drunken debauchery. Like character development & intelligence lurking beneath stupid actions.<br />Season 3 was the nadir. The absurd school teacher plotline of Hank's affairs w/ stripper student, TA, & head of college all at the same time was idiotic. Then Rick Springfield & Kathleen Turner really made things worse. Season 4 was a bit better, & now Season 5 is about the same as 4. Except the sparkle is gone. The 2 - 3 years Hank was supposedly back in NYC are skipped over completely (& that might have added some fresh ideas). Instead, he goes right back to LA where everything is pretty much the same. This time-jump is handled in a sloppy manner, as if the producers just don't care.<br /><br />How many more times do we have to see Charlie Runkle walk around bare-ass naked, or jerking-off to porn? How many times do we have to see him having sex w/ ridiculously beautiful women half his age? He would have to be a major movie director to pull that off, not just an agent w/ a nice house. Tom Kapinos has gotten into a rut like Judd Apatov with catch-phrases. The first time you hear \\"man-gina\\" it's kind of funny, but the 10th time, not so much. Rapper \\"Samurai\\" doesn't add much to the proceedings beyond a vague, stupid plot-device about Hank writing his \\"Santa Monica Cop\\" movie. Amazingly, it's actually a relief when Rob Lowe's character reappears toward end of the season. Marcy's marriage to Hollywood producer is boring, un-funny & sometimes just gross to observe...<br /><br />I still watched the season because the Hank Moody character is still a funny screw-up. But you can predict everything, like the annual flashback episode to when they first moved to LA (but look exactly the same age).<br />I hope they end this series really soon, so we can remember the great writing, verbal jabs (& sex & debauchery) from the first two seasons. Maybe Hankcould die having sex & then they give him a Viking funeral. Either that, or get Larry David to write the scripts.

B0095ZMMCK|3.0|The book wasn't fast and exciting like some of the other books by Tom Clancy, outcome was very predicable, I don't think a lot of thought went into the book it sort of had a serial mentality to it, like it came from a canned plot.

1594487154|5.0|When I heard Daniel Pink was releasing another book, I jumped at the chance to read an advanced copy.  I have read A Whole New Mind and Drive, and the latter has transformed the way in which I think, act, and lead.  Drive had many examples and Pink used research that translated well into many fields, including my profession, education.  To Sell Is Human is a great follow-up to Pink's previous books.<br /><br />The book is packed with practical examples on how to \\"sell.\\"  Pink does a great job convincing us that we are all in sales despite our current profession.  He begins the book by relaying to us that one out of nine people currently work in sales.  However, since all people are at some point trying to move, persuade, or even cajole others, then the other eight are in sales also.<br /><br />Pink's account of salesman Norman Hall is an example of Pink's gift at storytelling.  He followed Hall around and brought to life Hall's numerous experiences of selling as the last Fuller Brush Man.  I was disappointed by the section dedicated to education and health services (Ed-Med).  As an educator, I was hoping for more of a focus on education.  However, I realize that Pink's focus was much broader.<br /><br />I found Pink's new ABC's quite interesting.  Instead of \\"Always Be Closing,\\" Attunement, Buoyancy, and Clarity are the new ABC's.  It is in this section that Pink pays homage to contemporary social scientists.  He provides clear access to his sources and even has a section, \\"Read These Books,\\" for those who need more information.<br /><br />Pink's style of writing allows the reader to understand research on human behavior in simple terms.  His examples and storytelling make the reader believe that he/she should already know what Pink is telling us.  Each of his examples seem clear and not sophisticated.  However, I credit Pink's writing style for this feeling.  He has done the work for us and presents it in user friendly form.<br /><br />The final part of this work discusses \\"What To Do,\\" which is to Pitch, Improvise, and Serve.  The section on serving others sums up Pink's ideas well and even brings the end of the book full circle (\\"It begins and ends by remembering that to sell is human.\\")  Pink's use of Greenleaf's Servant Leadership is well placed and if we all followed the \\"Golden Rule\\" or as Pink cites the \\"Golden Girls' Rule\\" (this is my term, but Pink should consider it) and treat everybody as you would your grandmother, the world would be a better place, not just the world of sales.  Wait, we are all in sales.<br /><br />In short, get the book.  It is a quick read and it will make you think.<br /><br />(Disclosure: I received a copy of the book from the publisher, but the opinions expressed in this review are my own and haven't been edited or approved by anyone.)
B00942S4OY|5.0|What can I say? One Direction is loved by the ladies, and this is a perfect gift for them. The product was well packaged for shipping and my sister hasn't noticed any problems yet.
0345803485|2.0|I couldn't put the first book down, By the time I got to the third I was speed reading to get through it.  I just couldn't identify or feel anything for that matter for the characters.  Aside from the steamy scenes there was little else of interest.

Well done, great characters, feel-good with a wonderful sense of reality that kids will appreciate.  Our daughter is 6 and asked for it for Christmas after we rented as a family.  So it arrived under the tree this year for her so we'll be able to enjoy it again and again!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Good story, but overall, just Ok. The plot got a little confusing. It was engaging though. I read it to the end.
B009POCG2C|4.0|In this 2012 offering, Clint Eastwood makes his return to the big screen since the blockbuster, \\"Gran Torino\\". Eastwood plays Gus Lobel, an ancient, ailing baseball scout for the Atlanta Braves, who is perhaps embarking on his last scouting road trip, as younger Braves management is beginning to see him as an anachronism rather than an asset. Fortunately, his scouting boss happens to be his good friend and supporter, Pete (played by John Goodman), who suspects Gus is having physical problems. Pete calls up Gus's estranged daughter, Mickey (Amy Adams), an aspiring corporate lawyer, and urges her to go with her father on this last road trip. Being fiercely independent, Gus resents the intrusion of his daughter into his job, but after his anger subsides, he stubbornly accepts her at his side. Gus's job is to scout a highly touted top high school baseball prospect and decide whether \\"Bo\\" should be the Braves number one pick in the upcoming draft. It readily becomes apparent that Gus' failing vision puts him at a distinct disadvantage of evaluating Bo, so daughter Mickey steps in to be her father's failing eyes. In the process, she tries to reconnect with her father and figure out why he seemed to reject her and ignore her after the death of her mother when she was just 6 years old. She also rediscovers her true love of baseball, and learns from her father the intricacies on how to scout players, from the flow of their swings to the sound of the fastball hitting a mitt. Intermixed into the relationship is Johnny Flanagan, (Justin Timberlake), a rival scout who takes a definite love interest in Gus's daughter, Mickey.<br /><br />Although the movie stars Clint Eastwood, clearly, this is Amy Adams' movie. She absolutely shines in her role of \\"Mickey\\" (named after Gus's favorite Yankee player), and she single-handedly rescues this film from being a mediocre film about an aging old man, to a very relevant film on how a father and daughter reconcile their past hurts and differences. To his credit, Eastwood knows to step back from the limelight and let Adam's star shine. While baseball plays a major role as the backdrop of this movie, it is the troubled parent-child relationship that is the core of this film. Amy Adams is nothing but terrific and her performance may very well be Oscar-worthy. Justin Timberlake, as Johnny, is also remarkably well cast as Mickey's love interest. I thought Timberlake could only sing; but his acting performance is more than adequate, and his relationship with the emotionally confused and tentative Mickey carries this movie forward in a huge way. A strong supporting cast, namely John Goodman, shores up this movie as well.<br /><br />The ending is particularly satisfying, and while all the questions about the troubled relationship between parent and child are never fully answered, clearly, the relationship is healed, and there is a promising future for both Gus, Mickey, and Johnny.<br /><br />I hope this is not Eastwood's last film performance. He has some emotionally engaging scenes where he really shows his range as an actor. He has so much more to give yet to the film industry. I hope he finds another role that allows his diverse talents to shine.<br /><br />While probably not generally appealing to the crucial 16-24 age group, (thus not a box office smash hit), I believe many \\"Baby Boomers\\" will appreciate this movie, not only for the portrayal of the angrily aging parent, but for the reconciliation that is possible in all relationships.<br /><br />(Rated PG-13 for language).<br /><br />koneences.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I read a lot...and have never written a review even though I tend to enjoy most of the books I read. This is the kind of book you can't put down, but at the same time you get angry that you are reading it so quickly because you want to enjoy it longer. I managed to read this book in a day and I know the next book I read will not even come close to being as good as this one.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is exciting. and fun. It was nothing like I though. it would be.  It actually. put knots in my stomach.  Give it a try if you want a challenge.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|It was a fun and interesting read.  I enjoyed it as I have almost all of John Grisham's books and had a great plot line.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|I must say at first when listening to this VS. the old MFSL set, I wasn't sure what to say or think, as it is different.  Then I set out to objectively figure out what they did, or at least what I thought they did. I have been a musician all my life, and in and out of studios, and have been collecting LP's, well, forever.  I have a decent setup (Merrill Turntable ET tonearm, OC9/III cart into a Conrad Johnson preamp-certainly good enough to \\"hear the differences\\")<br />At first I knew they added some low end, which is fine, MFSL does that too.  Then I noticed the absolute lack of tape hiss that is very apparent on the older \\"straight from tape\\" pressings.  This makes it sound like it's not as clear as some of the older pressings, the MSFL ones in particular.  This is not really the case though.  By removing the tape hiss (no DBx in '62!) a lot more of the music comes through.  Is it better or just different?  It's up to the listener, as it is different.  I like it, and understand why the engineers did some of the things they did.  I think it makes it sound a lot more modern in its presentation.<br />As far as the box/book/etc, JUST AWESOME!  I may get a 2nd one of these at some point!
B007THA4FI|4.0|I thought that this book was a little harder to read than the Harry Potter series, but still a very good read.
B000024C7W|5.0|It's a shame that an artist of Stevie's pedigree couldn't be truly appreciated for his musical genius back during a time when that genius was fully unleashed, as on this experimental double album that was originally meant to go along with a rather interesting science documentary of the same name. Personally speaking, this may arguably have been the most rewarding of all his work that I've ever had the pleasure of listening to. The instrumentals and songs contained within may have even been primarily responsible for the ushering in of what would eventually come to be known as \\"New Age\\" music, which has gained quite a bit of popularity in recent years. Unfortunately, the critical and commercial backlash this album received upon its initial release in 1979 was so great that never again did Stevie venture too far from the pop realm he had previously dominated for much of that decade. In a sense, he briefly found himself in a situation not unlike what Joni Mitchell had endured a few years prior when she decided to pursue a more jazz-inspired route that actually began with 1976's 'Hejira' and ultimately reached fruition on 1979's 'Mingus' (coincidentally enough). While that period was undoubtedly one of the most musically satisfying of her career, it was also the one that inevitably cost Mitchell most of her commercial fan base. Mitchell, however, paid little heed to such things and continued to record whatever struck her musical interests whether people dug it or not. If only Stevie had remained as steadfast in following his own muse, we the music-buying public at large might've instead been treated to an entirely bold new direction from him as the 80s loomed just over the horizon. Talk about the ultimate \\"What if\\" scenario...    Enough rambling, just go out and get this album. Play it. Savor it. Digest it. Share it with your family and friends. The music and message may have fallen on deaf ears the first time, but they still continue to resonate on a higher level with each passing year. Check out the film while you're at it, too. It suffered a fate even more undeserving than the soundtrack itself. No wonder the collective consciousness of America has been trapped in a massive downward spiral ever since.  :-(

B0036BK6MW|5.0|We have long enjoyed sports and articles or books by Michael Lewis.  This movie is not really so much about the &#34;blind side&#34; that Lewis explained in his book with the same title for football fans, as it is about being truly kind and color blind.  Sandra Bullock does a great job of being a tough, loving mom to a huge young homeless black teenager.  Rich, white, Republicans with two children of their own prove that love and sympathy are not just for bleeding heart liberals.  The new family confronts the problems Big Mike brings them one at a time:  No place to sleep?  Stay with us.  No clothes? That's what stores are for. Can't read? The &#34;Christian&#34; school our kids go to, should be able to help with that.  A mother who is a drug addict? She'll want what's best for her baby.  Big but unwilling to fight on the football field? Pretend you're protecting your family.  Smarmy maybe, but true.  This is a great story that could become a Christmas season favorite.
B0050SYS5A|2.0|Kinect ZOOM by nyko<br />This would have been a great idea, if it worked. I wish X-Box worked with these people to make this.<br />The product is like adding a wide-angle lens on your kinect. When I first attached it to the Kinect, and went through the setup, I was amazed at how much more of the room you see. I could move about 2 feet away from the TV, and the Kinect could still see my whole body.<br />wow.<br />Then it went down hill.<br />First... the resolution drops a lot. With just the Kinect, I can see the wrinkles in my pants, and shirt. With the ZOOm attached, I look like an 80's video game.<br />Then... When I saved my setting in the Kinect setup, it saved, then looked up at the ceiling. That is not where I wanted it looking.<br />Then... When I want back into Kinect setup (with the the ZOOM attached this time) it says \\"Kinect could not see floor\\".<br />The only way I found to use it, was to put the Kinect on a DVD case, so it's tilted the correct way. The Kinect with the ZOOM on it, will always look straight up. So if you tilt it to look down, it will see the correct area you want, but again: Resolution is weak.<br />Great Idea, poor result.<br />I think they should have tested this, before releasing it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Absolutely loved it. Would definitely read it again and recommend it to everyone. Keeps you very interested through beginning to end.
B001FB4VZS|3.0|I'm not one of the fans of the darker tone the series took, the whole &#34;Doomsday&#34; storyline I could've done without. A couple of the better episodes were # 1 &#34;Odyssey&#34; where Oliver finds and rescues the missing Clark and Kristen Kreuk's reappearance in # 13 &#34;Power&#34; as a super powered Lana Lang. I think I skimmed through the DVD set when I got it and haven't been back since. I really don't know that I care whether or not it's on Blu-ray.

0679731377|5.0|Julian Barnes' brilliantly-titled 1989 book is essentially a collection of short stories. But what is fascinating is not really the stories themselves; Barnes would go on to write better individual examples, most notably in his magnificent collection THE LEMON TABLE (2004). No, it is the intricate connection between the chapters that makes the whole much more than the sum of its parts (and causes Wikipedia to list it among the author's novels rather than his collections).<br /><br />Variations on a theme, you might say. A theme stated right at the beginning with a hilarious revisionist account of Noah's Ark, told by a woodworm stowaway. In this version, the Ark is really a flotilla commanded by a tyrannical martinet under the orders of a God who \\"holds all the cards and wins all the tricks.\\" Forget the two-by-two business; these animals were loaded in large enough numbers (at least the clean ones) for the Noahs to eat them, and the more repulsive of the others were not invited on board at all. It is a brilliant opening, funny and inventive, yet posing serious religious questions, and with chilling overtones of the issues of genetic purity that would bedevil Noah's descendants in the mid-20th century.<br /><br />Even in his later collections, Barnes has a fondness for writing stories around real people or events. So his variants on the Ark theme, mostly much grimmer, include a survivor from the Titanic, the story of the ship full of Jewish refugees fleeing Germany in 1939 only to be denied landing in the Americas, and the PLF hijacking of the Achille Lauro in 1985. His chapter \\"Shipwreck\\" is a brilliant analysis of Th&eacute;odore G&eacute;ricault's painting \\"The Raft of the Medusa\\" and the history behind it; having attempted to lecture on this subject many times in my earlier career as an art historian, I take my hat off to Barnes' brilliance. There are two stories about expeditions to Mount Ararat to find the remains of the Ark, one by two Irishwomen in the earlier 19th century, the other thinly based on the attempt by NASA astronaut James Irwin in 1973, who went to the moon in one Ark and dedicated the rest of his life to finding another. Even the fictional stories have some factual basis. \\"Upriver\\" is a series of increasingly desperate letters from a British actor to his girlfriend, while going into the South American jungle on a raft as the star of a movie very similar to THE MISSION (1986). And \\"The Survivor\\" is about a woman who takes a small boat out into the Indian Ocean to escape fallout from the Chernobyl disaster of 1986 and an imagined nuclear war.<br /><br />The latter story is a fascinating amalgam of fact and hallucination that introduces the concept of \\"fabulation,\\" or the creation of stories to explain matters one cannot understand or accept. This is of course what a fact-based fiction writer like Barnes does all the time, but in a conscious and controlled manner. His final story applies the idea, also in a comic register, to the concept of a gratifying but ultimately unsatisfactory heaven where you can shop with an inexhaustible credit card and bring your golf score down to 18. His half-chapter (which didn't really work for me) is a philosophical discussion on love as another kind of fabulation. And his Biblical reenactments (he tells the story of Jonah as well as Noah) are humanist demonstrations of fable as the groundpinning of religion. But the most fabulous story in the whole book, \\"The Wars of Religion,\\" tells of a court case brought by a French village in 1520, demanding the excommunication of the woodworm that ate the legs of their bishop's throne causing its collapse, the bishop's downfall, and the village's disgrace. The religious arguments on both sides are as ingenious as they come, and utterly farcical.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|my last kindle broke and I had this app on it I loved it so much I got it on my new one its amazing
B005KELQEU|4.0|Bought it for my wife's kindle (mine travels inside my laptop bag) so it won't get scratches from the other 1000's things inside her bag
B000U7SN8O|3.0|Is it because this group only existed for a short time? People seem to go a little extra gaga over short-lived music acts that have somewhat decent albums. My Bloody Valentine also springs to mind. People are insane about that group, and their most highly regarded album, &#34;Loveless&#34;, is a boring, droning, experiment in sonic smogginess.<br /><br />Neutral Milk Hotel, on the other hand, is good at what they do. And what they do is arthouse folk-punk. By just listening to the clips of these songs on Amazon, I got the impression that the songs were much more inspired and exciting then what my ears received upon listening to the whole album. The songs have a modicum of soul, which is commendable, but contain much less penchant for hooks than I led myself to believe.<br /><br />Boiling it down, if you like Irish/Scottish drinking songs, you'll like Neutral Milk Hotel. A more unplugged version of, say, The Pogues, every song of theirs sounds like it headlined at Shane McGowan's wake.
B005H29GSI|1.0|We tried...I mean really, REALLY tried to like this game..but it wouldn't let us!  The pieces are cheaply made and some are misshapen which does not allow stacking. A poorly designed product ruined what was a great concept and could have been fun \\"hands-on\\" interpretation of the game.  We are so disappointed.
B00000F14B|5.0|This is an excellent musical! The acting is wonderful and the main cast sings amazingly. So much fun to watch!
B004G6009U|5.0|Disney has finally gotten their CGI act together and this movie is the result. It ressembles more a Pixar classic than a Disney produced Chicken Little. Great for all ages and the CGI is amazing.
B001JRB16U|5.0|Who doesn't love Mary Poppins?! Got this DVD for my husband for Christmas, he insisted we own it on DVD:)
B000NQRE1E|5.0|This movie stands the test of time. It's very captivating and looks awesome on bluray. Great addition to my library.
B009X01GJ2|5.0|Bought this for my daughter to hold her new kindle.  Very pleased with the design.  Although she is only 6 she is very picky about her device and it being clean so she uses a stylus to prevent fingerprint marks.  The stylus secures nicely in the case as well make it a perfect combination of form and function.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Definitely a good game if you like dark style hidden object games. I can't wait for the follow-up. While this game is good normally, the collectors edition is a bit better with additional material.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Another well written page turner.  All the usually characters and a well integrated plot.  Lots of heroes in this one.  Definitely worth buying.
B009POCG5Y|5.0|This movie was so worth buying. I do not always buy movies as I only watch most movies once. As soon as I watched it I knew that I would be watching it again and again. Terrific movie and I think one of Clints' better movies. Although by my husbands words, Clint doesn't make a bad movie.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Proof of heaven connects the two worlds that share our conscientious. Remarkable and inspiring are good adjectives but do not do justice to its impact on the mind, heart and spirit of those individuals who peruse truth.
B0088TG252|5.0|It has to be a great movie if you are watching Denzel Washington. Well, I did see one of his that I didn't like but this was not the one. Safe House is a good movie holding your interest.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Once this book develops it is difficult to put down. Ender Wiggin's empathetic nature is captivating and the author intelligently, simply and successfully highlights the nature of the world we as a society have created. Impressive indeed.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great twists and turns! You think you're reading one book and then bam, half way through it  something completely different.
B0086700CM|4.0|Even though it's all about running, it's surprisingly fun and challenging. Though it does freeze my Kindle Fire once in a while, it would be better if they could fix that problem. Otherwise, it's a very good game. 4 out of 5 stars.
B007ZD17XO|1.0|WHY R ALL THESE GAMES DECEIV ING?? ONE PRICE SAYS ONE PRICE THEN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GAME---SAYS THIS GAME ALLOWS U TO BUY MORE TO HELP WITH GAME..SAY IT LIKE IT IS...TO FINISH THE GAME. MUST HAVE XTRA MONEY...AND THIS GAME U CAN BUY..BUY. .. BUY. MRS A BONEYTI
B007KAJG3K|5.0|Not only is this a great movie but you can't beat it in Blu-ray. This needs to go in your movie collection.
B009POCG2C|5.0|Clint Eastwood was as always great. John Goodman also with Amy Adams were just perfect, Best father and daughter movie made.
B009JBZH54|5.0|A must have for Batman fans. Comes with a neat booklet on how the movies were made and the Blu-ray just adds to it.<br />With all three movies in a box it adds up to a great value.
B007Q0OV6Q|4.0|My son woke up each day and the first thing he did was go to the advent calendar. I wished some of the pieces were<br />better but he loved it and thats what counts.
B005H0CBZ0|5.0|Can't wait for the next one in the series and really love the characters  Have a fantasy now to visit Scotland
B001TOD9VI|2.0|cracked case.  the case was cracked at the top. case was cracked at the top .  case was cracked. . .
B005HCI72O|5.0|Love how the story has unfolded and now am well and truly involved with the characters of this series and wait the next one
B0034G4P8A|5.0|I was very happy with the price which what prompted me to order it online.  The order came very quickly too which was awesome!  Made an excellent Christmas gift!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Made me extremely sad, 'cause this is an emotional story. I'm sure that August will touch your life, just as he has mine.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|I was very happy with the price which what prompted me to order it online.  Made an excellent Christmas gift!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Oh dear God!!! I started this in the afternoon and read till 1.30am so I could finish it!! What an amazing, gut wrenching, beautiful read. Holder was such an amazing, very mature (for his age), beautiful character.  He adored Sky even with his confusion about her.  His support and love for Sky knew no bounds and he took on her pain as his own.  I'm not one usually for lots of angst in a book (it affects me way too deeply at times), but this had the right amount. I didn't need any &#34;chapter breaks&#34;! There's a few twists and turns....some I predicted, one I most certainly did not! Really, you will like, &#34;live&#34; and love this book.  Holder is my new book boyfriend (my list is long! Lol). 5 eternal stars for this gem. Ps. There's an additional chapter that Colleen Hoover has put up to download. it's Holder's POV.....the first kiss that wasn't a first kiss....woah. Swooooon!!!!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I was very happy with the price which what prompted me to order it online.  The order came very quickly too which was awesome!  Made an excellent Christmas gift!
B005LAIGYQ|4.0|The movie did an excellent job of showing the capabilities and sacrifices our Navy Seals undergo, Well worth the price. The DVD arrived promptly in good shape.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is fun and has lots of levels to keep on challenging.  It is easy to catch on and great for all ages.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|it's got some challenging elements which make it extra good. definitely worth the $$. even when you &quot;finish&quot; the game, you can go back and get additional trophies.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|couldn't put this book down.  it was a gripping encounter and glimpse into the life of a navy seal.  it was worth the time to read
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I didn't find the work erotic or worthy of the designation, &#34;mommy porn.&#34;  It was just another vanilla -- bland and bordering on boring.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|glad to be able to get this on my kindle and not have to lug around a huge book  -- hopefully it won't take me forever to read it  love the movie and musical - curious to find out what was not included in those venues
0446310786|3.0|It was a little more worn then I thought and one page already coming out but they did say it was used and had markings which was fine.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|a good family movie and such a touching storey.  my family was pleasantly surprised by this movie and anyway - who doesn't like watching richard gere?
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book exceeded all my expectations. I couldn't stop reading it once I started. I Can't wait to read the next two books.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|A Christmas classic. What more do I need to say? Should be in every collection and watched every single year.
B0091REZMW|4.0|good game but very slow sticks a lot takes a long time to load but it is fun would suggest to others
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I chose this novel for the sole purpose of following the decades old Jack Ryan saga. I must say that although Threat Vector did not measure up to the most recent JR texts, I was still intrigued at the reintegration of the China-US relationship, once again on the brink of major warfare.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great entertainment, can play as much as you want.  Helps me relax, while still a challange. Easier than holding a deck of cards.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Lee Child still captivates the audience the same way he did with The Killing Floor. A must read for all Jack Reacher fans.
0802473156|5.0|This book can save a marriage.  My husband and I have always had communication problems - exactly like it says in the book, we seemed to be speaking a foreign language to each other.  With this book we have much more understanding  of each other and it makes a big difference.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I love the show and now I can watch it many times and catch all the great lines.  Great price too.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|First off, I am a huuuuuuge Spiderman freak. 7$ for the app discouraged me at first. I decided to wait to get it. The next day I wanted to get it so badly, and it was only 0.99$!!!!<br />Best. Buy. EVER.<br />Buy it. It's worth like 10$. Graphics are amazing, gameplay is fun. Story plot and random crimes to fight.  And you can web sling across the open world. So much fun.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|Good book over all had a lot of detail one of the best reads in my life read it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yay
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I love this book! It was very interesting reading about Charlie's life. I think everyone should read this book because it's easy and fun to read.
B0063IH60K|4.0|the game plays the way it should. no problems yet. works on kindle fire. something nice to play in bed when husband is snoring. lol.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I purchased stadium arcadium by red hot chili pepper. It is a 2 disc cd. both cds were clean. artwork and case like new.. will by from again
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|One of the best series of books I've ever read! I highly recommend these books. Read all 3 in four days.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I enjoyed the first book in this series, and loved the second.  Great story very well told.  I like the historical data that is provided in the book as well.  Very interesting way to learn history as part of a good novel.
B0086700CM|2.0|This game is to hard for a sixty-six year old lady to play.  It is for young people that have quick fingers.
0062200909|5.0|This book is so well crafted and bound. Each page is think colorful with quality throughout. Really nice artist drawings and the outer cover is gorgeous.
0399157565|5.0|I love reading Patricia Cornwell 's book.  They are always full of the lastest investigate methods,  and she is able to keep your attention.  A great read!
B002UM5BXW|5.0|Tony Bourdain's autobiography is a must-read for would-be professional chefs, aspiring writers, and fans of entertaining memoirs. There aren't any recipes in here (for that, see his equally entertaining [[ASIN:158234180X Anthony Bourdain's Les Halles Cookbook: Strategies, Recipes, and Techniques of Classic Bistro Cooking]] ); this is the story of his life, from learning to love food, particularly French bistro cuisine, to becoming a chef over the course of a long, winding career during which he almost destroyed himself with drug addiction. Written in an entertaining, no-BS style that combines \\"literary\\" with \\"street*\\" in a way that any essayist should study, \\"Kitchen Confidential\\" is filled with anecdotes about working in a restaurant kitchen that should have done two things by the time the reader is done: disabuse anyone who doesn't want to be a chef more than anything in their life from going into the business, and convincing you to never, ever order the fish special on Mondays. Highly recommended, whether you're interested in the restaurant business or not.<br /><br />*(Tony's language pulls no punches, so those bothered by bad words should perhaps look elsewhere.)
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I rarely look on facebook.  I get to many unauthorized e-mails if I do check it.  Also,  I do not like the new format.
1451695195|1.0|Not what I was expecting at all! The author may be very intelligent regarding the medical field, but he has fallen for a lot of \\"New Age\\" \\"mumbo jumbo\\".<br /><br />If he wishes to describe his vision of the afterlife that is fine, but to use the term \\"Heaven\\" in the title, which comes with a lot of Judeo-Christian connotations, I feel is very misleading, and a blatant effort to \\"market\\" his book for the highest possible sales.<br /><br />If your looking for \\"truth\\" this is not it!
B00005214X|5.0|There are so many reasons for this being one of the greatest albums of all time starting with the songs themselves not s bad song among them. I remember the day this came out I was in the Air Force and I saw it at the px picked it up and went straight back to my room to listen to it all three sides. I was just blown away of the greatness of these songs. I grew up with The Beatles weird as it may seem I was always drawn to the George songs few they be. As the years went on there were more on each release. We see here there could have so many more on anthology 3 we hear some demos of songs completed here.<br />The album opens strong I'd Have You Anytime a song written by George with Bob Dylan who would be a close friend of George.I could go and talk about each song they are all great. The only non George song is Dylan's If Not For You by the way there is a great version of this song on Dylan's album bootleg Volume 1,2 &3 it has Dylan with George on slide beautiful.<br />Look at the group of people George brought together for this record of course at the heart of it is George and his life long buddy Eric Clapton little did Eric realize that he would meet and record with his next great band Derek & the Dominos there is the single version of Roll It Over on the 40th Anniversary edition of Layla that not only was recorded during George's album but both George and Dave Mason appear on it. The flip side Tell The Truth was also record at this time.<br />The core of musicians on George's album are from Delaney Bonnie & Friends who Eric toured with George and Dave Mason were also on that tour.<br />All Things Must Pass was the first solo Beatlles album to go number 1and remember this at the time was a three record set. And yes when I said I like all of the songs that does include the jam record.<br />This is one of those must have albums this edition sounds wonderful the extra tracks are great. It was so great that George revisited this great work of his things come full circle on a couple of the added tracks with George's son playing on them.<br />A lot of these same people would go on to show up on Leon Russell's first album, the Eric Clapton record, Dave Mason's Alone Together all of these are great albums and are available at Amazon. See what George started and we didn't even bring up Joe Cocker Mad Dogs & Englishman or the great Bangladesh concert and album.e on a couple of the added tracks with George's son playing on them.<br />A lot of these same people would go on to show up on Leon Russell's first album, the Eric Clapton record, Dave Mason's Alone Together all of these are great albums and are available at Amazon.

B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I never thought I'd say this but..I love this app!<br /><br />Very cute concept without being too easy.<br /><br />I'd almost say it's kind of like Drawn To Life the video game, a bit similar, so if you like that type of game, this is for you!<br /><br />My only complaint is I had a bit of trouble downloading it, which is probably because of my low internal storage on my First generation Kindle Fire.<br /><br />YOU GOTTA GET IT! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B004EPYZPS|4.0|this was a very good movie. i had heard of it before but never watched it and now that I did, it's a pretty good. Worth the buy and interesting.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|In the world of this book - a near-future dystopia - Ernest Cline sets a compelling mystery plot that weaves in and out of the real and virtual worlds.  It's tight, compelling, and drew me in quickly and didn't let go.  If that wasn't enough, there's one other thing:  If you're a child of the 80's and remember stepping into a video arcade with ANY degree of fondness, just stop reading reviews and pick this book up now.  Really.  This book is enjoyable for anybody... but if you know the difference between the sounds of Mario coins and Sonic coins, or instantly place the quote \\"Red Warrior Needs Food Badly\\"... well, this book was made for you.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Interesting topic but the book was so long because of John Corey's thoughts and remarks and not on the story line.  The book could have been a little shorter with shorter Corey thoughts.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|This book manages to balance both a challenging point of view - you are responsible for your habits, and therefore are responsible for everything that happens to you - without being preachy or pessimistic.  Each section largely centers around a single case study (with illustrative anecdotes and data from other sources) that clearly demonstrates the point being made... while managing to not lecture or talk down to the reader.  The case studies are compellingly written and researched, making the book not just fascinating, but fun to read.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book! My inner book worm is happy :) I can't wait to finish the entire trilogy :)
B0079XPUOW|5.0|This book *could* be a one-joke wonder - \\"Huh.  Redshirts die a lot.  Huhuhuh.\\"  This book *could* be a good satire, like GalaxyQuest was.  Redshirts is neither.  Redshirts takes the primary joke, the biting satire, and then once it's just about got you thinking that you know where it's going, it slams down a sharp right turn and throws in solid characterization and an unexpected huge helping of solid plot and suspense.  There is a reason this book has gotten so much attention.  It's that damn good, with special delights for fans of a specific franchise....
B00A4YVHXQ|4.0|Fun and entertaining even just for little ones watching.  Easy to use. Would enjoy an update with more songs though.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|i got it as the free app of the day but i think it is worth the 2 bucks it is an addicting game
B008L1DNGI|2.0|I played this game once for about 20 minutes and I will not ever play it again.  It is not terrible, but you have to get used to it and the stages start getting repetitive.
B00APUQRPC|3.0|The plot was slow, it was difficult to understand Clint Eastwood, the character development wasn't there. We picked out the pitcher from the get go but you didn't see or hear from him once during the rest of the movie until the last 10 minutes or so.T
0374530718|5.0|this is a interesting book of the history of philosophy. this book is by author jostein gaarder. I love it
B001AQT0UY|5.0|I  like how the movie starts off as a cute and cuddly film .  Then it switches off to a scary film. Classic!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really really enjoyed The Hunger Games. Better than the movie by far! Can't wait to start the next one!!
B00APUQT7I|4.0|Was worry it wouldn't be as good as the other one's, but it probably was better, enjoyed it very much.
B009P5S11G|5.0|I bought it for a Christmas gift.  He loves it!  Thinks its the best gift!<br /><br />Its the best gift ever.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Very pleased. Perfect condition. Both discs were in the package. Packaging was very nice. Extremely pleased with this. Especially, the price. Very very very happy.
B000002OX7|5.0|Yes we have taste in all kinds of music.  this old rock n roll really helps us roll down the highway.  thanks
B007KOYEOC|5.0|Never thought I would actually be able to feel sorry for the Christian character when I  started to read the first book in this trilogy. E.L. James  did a brilliant job by letting me feel compassion for this twisted character! And Fifty Shades Freed was the perfect end to this beautiful saga.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Thanks Vince for a great story.  Very timely and probably parallels the truth on many fronts.  Good description and dissemination of the Afghanistan problem.
1451608659|4.0|Couldn't wait to read this book because I grew up idolizing Dominique. Such a sad but amazing story of an amazingly strong young girl. Some parts were a little repetitive (especially in the beginning) but I just skimmed those parts. It was great to get some inside info about what life is like at the Karoyli Ranch and how much work and sacrifice it took Dominique to reach her dreams.
B000002ADT|5.0|I hae always been a fan of the Blues it just has this sound to it that is instantly soothing and relaxing. I bought this after listening to it on youtube, I just had to have it and I am in no way disappointed. By far one of my favorite CD's and the fact that i actually purchased the CD is proof enough to just how much I fell in love with it. Highly recommended!!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Just another way I can keep track of all my important stuff. So glad this is free - I use it constantly!
0143038419|5.0|I thought this was a really great read I don't think everyone realizes that this is based on one womans journey so it's not meant to be a definitive guide to your own journey but it definitely does inspire the reader. After reading this book it makes me want to start my own journey of self discovery, not that I want to travel to India and visit an ashram but still being able to experience these countries through the writer is inspirational and insightful. I thought this was a really great book and watched the movie the day after I finished it. I, of course, thought the book was better because there was just so much more detail and personal emotion. I would definitely suggest this book to other people, it's a great story and for me it sparked something inside me that has always wanted to start some kind of spiritual journey of self discovery to come alive again and say so why not now?
B007BFSYMS|5.0|This is the best white noise app out there. The sounds are great and you can download more off the website. But if you don't want to pay...just try the lite version but I reccomend this app.
B00992CF6W|3.0|This game is honestly fun if you haven't played the computer version... No pistons Armor end nether etc... So you might feel let down like I did when I didn't see all these items that I normally do. If you have never played minecraft before this is definitely a good stepping stone, but otherwise you might feel let down. Also you might have trouble with moving your guy around, how you walk and jump are mixed together, so you may get frustrated, but in my opinion it is not worth $7.00, maybe $2.00... One more thing the maps are very small, so yes diamonds are all in one area, but you have not much room to expand...
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Easy to use and plenty of options.  I enjoy the selection of tones.  Straightforward app and the price is right.
B009CPEOC4|1.0|I purchased this video but could not get it to show on my Kindle HD so I didn't get to watch it.
B0079R8IYW|1.0|The case did not do what it was suposed to do, it did not stand properly nor did it fit my kindle fire correctly.  Currently looking for a new case/stand
B0085YNML2|3.0|This is a great game for children. I kinda like it myself. Takes a bit of getting the hang of it.
B0024FADAQ|5.0|Great date night sci-fi movie.  Thriller and romance.  They did a great job on this movie.  Campy, but cute.  Lots of action, suspense and space fighting.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Just what I was looking for. Gives me a reading plan from day to day. This will greatly help me in my studies.
B0038ZITIE|5.0|Campy but cute.  Thriller & romance. Max Von Sydow was Ming.  They did a pretty good job mimicing the concept of who & what Flash Gordon was.  Much better than the old Flash Gordon (Buster Crabbe) 1930's movies. Gotta see at least once if you like sci-fi & fantasy.
B0086700CM|4.0|This is a very good game, but a little too advanced for me. All my friends have it, I just guess I must improve my reflexes.
B000BYA4JM|5.0|While I am not fond of Madonna or most of her music, I find that I have liked her in many of her acting roles.  Thought she did a great job in this film for its content and time when it was made.  Fun & cute film.  Should be good for date night.  Also liked her in Shanghai Surprise with Sean Penn
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book was great. Had me on the edge of my seat from page 1! Great read for anyone looking for adventure!
B000QCQ9O8|5.0|I gave this book  5 stars because it delved into the mind of a 13 year old girl and exposed an innocent, but tragic mistake that changed a family forever.  Ian McEwan  in &#34;Atonement&#34; brilliantly established the budding, but immature writing ability of this child, that moved  her to fill in the blanks in her testimony in a rape of her cousin.  I found the first part of the book a little boring, but it was worth wading through to get into the head of this child.  I was mesmerized from then on.  It provoked the question: how often are mistakes made because of an incorrect prescription for the lens a witness is looking through?
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think the game is so go good, but i lost gold brick and my friend gave me a gold brick i did not have it.but beside it is a really great game.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Having a blast playing this with my son. My students have been playing the PC version for years! This is a great way to expose children to decision making and planning. Love it!
B005KTZ05G|5.0|Bought as a Christmas stocking stuffer for our 13 yr old son who loves everything Assassin's Creed. Nice memorabilia for the Creed Brotherhood
B00846REIS|4.0|Good book! Love the characters, the story line fits modern times. If you liked 50 shades, you'll love Bared to you!
B009KHBDUU|5.0|great movie, funny and down to earth.<br />Johnny Depp is the best<br />would definitely recommmend it to everyone to see
B00417HV14|5.0|I just dicovered John Bonammasa in 2011 and the more I hear him play the more impressed I become. He's mastered all the greats and put them all into his own distinctive John Bonamassa style. You won't be let down on this purchase. It make a great addition to your band DVD collection. Cheers.
B0039N74CW|5.0|I purchased Shrek  for my grandchildren and we enjoyed the movie very much.  I highly recommend this movie.  Enjoyed fully.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|love it, purchse was easy great Christmas gift family movie what more can I say, but thank you, nothing else
B008ZDC7M8|2.0|I was into the first disc, because there were intriguing images and details of film pioneers and historical setting I'd read about but never seen before.  The downside gradually took over, because Mr. Cousins reflexively serves offerings to the altar of sermonizing opinions.  I don't care about his saying that our pedestrian notion of Hollywood's primacy is &#34;racist by omission&#34; (of other cultural advances to the art). It's so patronizing.  just move on and SHOW us those contributions... i'm all eyes and ears and I can figure it out myself.  He begrudges Hollywood with every turn, after he extols the innovations that went on there... Even though artists came from all over Europe to participate in the Hollywwod system.  there's a strain of jealousy extant in these themes and its tiresome.  I've had professors who exploit their captive audience to editorialize matters of creative subjectivity and there's a butt load of that here.  I'd love to see a condensed non self-serving version of this epic series without the meandering style.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great games I love it and it was very fun and I just love it<br />:):):):):):);):):):);):):);););):);):) I meanness I just loooove it
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Enjoyed the book. Plan on reading the rest of the books in this trilogy.  Got to see what's going to happen next.
B005D6O1G0|5.0|These shoes are perfect! A very slim style of Crocs and I can't wait to go to the waterparks with my kids this summer! No worries about ruining my shoes in the water! They feel very comfortable and I feel pretty wearing them! Great Quality!

B009YP9L7U|3.0|I thought this book was ok. The plot was just too rushed. The 3 month trial just felt like a 2 weeks trial and they really didn't do anything much. Maybe adding a honeymoon with some laughs would have made the book good. Not the best romance book, but it's good to read if you don't have nothing else to read and just want to pass some time up.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I thought MAYBE I would give the 2nd book a chance since the first one was so doggone awful. BIG MISTAKE! By about the 20th page I was so sick of the stupid descriptions, the rolling of the eyes, the biting of the bottom lip, the description of how beautiful and wealthy stupid Christian was, I wanted to throw up. These books are for people who have never read a real novel before, and who have not one clue what a good book is! Sorry, if this is what women in the world think is good reading, there are some serious problems with our world. Stupid and disgusting and boring! I found myself speed reading just to get to the end of the book. And the little 'teaser' at the end of the book is SO obviously a ploy to get people to buy the next book, it's ridiculous. Seriously? Yuk!!!
B004P8JPS6|4.0|Another fine read from Lee Child. Having read many others in the teacher series it was nice to get a little back story on the character.
B007JRU4N0|4.0|The movie was good.  The story line excellent but sad. The actors were excellent. If you are in the mood for a sad movie then this is for you.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I love the Vampire Diaries.  I bought this season for REALLY cheap during Amazon's lightening deals.  I gave it to my sister for Christmas.
B004X75RK4|5.0|Great feel good movie!  Makes you laugh and how could you miss with Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. Story line was great.
B00000G3Q4|1.0|Very cult miovie. I personally do not like such cult sort of movie. I felt very uncomfortable on many scene and could not complete this. Avoid.
B00005JLEX|4.0|We watch episodes almost everyday! Very funny, entertaining and this show makes us laugh and smile. Can't wait to get season three.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|You know I went to see \\"Les Miserables\\" on Christmas Day. You know I convinced family and friends to not get together for dinner on Christmas evening, as was the tradition, because seeing this film was more important. I've been waiting to see \\"Les Mis\\" for months, damnit, and I wasn't about to wait any longer. I was ready to see something phenomenal. Something that would be a sucker punch of emotion...and a chance to see some of my favorite actors in a film like I've never seen before.<br /><br />\\"Les Miserables\\" is unlike any film musical I've ever seen. The level of emotion is unmatched. The performances are out of this world. The story is ambitious, and the scope is huge. It's at once a very personal story about its various characters, but at the same time, these people are singing for a generation, that has fascinating parallels to events going on today. It's an incredible feat that I didn't think could be committed to film so well.<br /><br />Director Tom Hooper certainly had the courage of his convictions. A film adaptation of Cameron Mackintosh and Claude Michel Schonberg's beloved stage musical \\"Les Miserables\\" had been in development hell since the mid 1980s. The pieces for a successful film adaptation never quite came together. A non-musical adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel starring Liam Neeson and Uma Thurman came out in 1998, but that film was sub-par at best.<br /><br />Hooper assembled a cast that doesn't seem like the best fit for a musical, including Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe and Anne Hathaway, none of which, to my knowledge, are trained singers. He then decided that these actors, as well as everyone else in the cast, would sing live, instead of lip-synching to studio-prerecorded tracks. I had not known that movie musicals typically did it this way, and that singing live was a new and scary thing. This element would heighten emotion for the audience. This idea is superb and will show to be a game-changer for movie musicals. Each actor's performance is more intimate and personal than they would have been otherwise. Hooper really wants the viewer to connect emotionally with these characters, and for the most part, we connect with these people deeply.<br /><br />\\"Les Mis\\" follows Jean Valjean (Jackman), a man who was jailed for nineteen years for stealing a loaf of bread for his starving family - five years for the theft, and thereafter for subsequent attempts to escape. He breaks his parole, and police inspector Javert (Crowe) dedicates his life to imprisoning Valjean again. Valjean comes across Fantine (Hathaway), an unwed mother who, after unjustly losing her job, is degraded to the point of no return, being forced to sell her hair, her teeth, her body and her dignity. Valjean promises Fantine that he will raise her daughter Cosette as his own, in her absence. Valjean then saves Cosette from the Thenardiers(Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter, pairing up in their second movie musical), neglectful guardians and scheming inkeepers, and the story picks up years later, where Cosette is a young woman (Amanda Seyfried), living mostly in peace. A young revolutionary Marius (Eddie Redmayne) falls in love with her. The Thenardier's destitute biological daughter Eponine has a hopeless and unrequited love for Marius. These young characters dive headfirst into what would become a very important part of the French Revolution.<br /><br />The story of the French Revolution, as depicted in the film, is so reminiscent of Occupy Wall Street protests that went on last year - a group of young idealists looking for a better tomorrow. They're willing to die in the name of a future. They're extremely passionate and exuberant. There are protests, except, you know, they're all sung.<br /><br />Yes, it's all sung. Les Miserables is two hours and forty minutes of song. There's no real spoken dialogue the entire way through. Every minute is sung live as well. And if this bothers you, please skip \\"Les Mis\\" and enjoy watching something like \\"Twilight\\" or \\"Jack Reacher\\". Tom Hooper made this film a game-changer for the way a movie-musical is supposed to work. Lip-synching a pre-recorded studio version seems economical, but today, can allow for auto-tuning and editing a singer's voice. It doesn't feel personal. The voices in \\"Les Mis\\" sound raw and real. The actors sang live onset with earpieces playing piano accompaniment, with a 70-piece orchestra being added in in post production. The music sounds extraordinary. There sure as hell isn't any auto-tuning going on.<br /><br />For example, take Anne Hathaway's rendition of \\"I Dreamed A Dream\\". At this point in the story, we don't know Fantine very well, but we see the struggle that she's put through. She's at her lowest point. Hathaway half-belts and half-sobs the iconic song, the entire thing being filmed in one take. It's an extremely emotional performance that will bring any person with a heart, to tears.<br /><br />Criticism that I've been hearing of the film mostly revolves around the performances of Russell Crowe and Hugh Jackman, as Javert and Valjean. I think both of these guys did fantastic jobs, quite frankly. Crowe isn't the best singer in the world, but his voice fits the part of Javert very well. As for Jackman, well, it could be argued that he carried the entire film. I think he did a splendid job; the role of Jean Valjean is a giant undertaking, and I think he nailed it.<br /><br />However, the real excellence of this film lies in the supporting cast. Everybody is perfectly cast, but particularly Samantha Barks in the role of Eponine. She played the same character in the 25th Anniversary performance of Les Miserables, only two years ago. One small criticism; my favorite part of Eponine's solo (and theme song to self-loathing masochists everywhere) \\"On My Own\\", the beginning part, is cut entirely. However, once you see what Barks does with this song it's easily forgiven.<br /><br />Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen, who look like they're in \\"Sweeney Todd 2\\", are great comic relief as the Thenardiers. Cohen is the only cast member in this Paris-set film who sings in a French accent, however... I find that strange. Eddie Redmayne and Aaron Tveit are perfect as Marius and his colleague Enjolras. Redmayne's \\"Empty Chairs at Empty Tables\\", near the end of the film, will make you cry. His voice goes to extraordinary places, and in such an emotional number, where he's telling the story of his friends who are no longer with him, this is a place where the live singing truly shines.<br /><br />The live singing, itself, is a huge undertaking, cinematically. Director Tom Hooper certainly had alot at stake with this project, however, there are still things that he could have done better. There are so many close-ups in the film. While they work for solos like \\"I Dreamed A Dream\\" and \\"Empty Chairs\\", they don't work for others. I also kind of feel like Hooper used the fish-eye camera lens a little too often, but these are inconsequential criticisms that don't make the film any less powerful.<br /><br />I hate it when people applaud in a movie theater. I find it trite and kind of pointless, unless you're at the world premiere of the movie, with the director and actors present. However, I'm not ashamed to say that \\"Les Miserables\\" brought me to tears no less than five times. I was completely enthralled by each actor's performance, and the applause that the entire theater gave at the end was completely appropriate and well-deserved. I wanted to watch it again the minute it ended, and for a nearly three hour long film, I think that's a pretty high compliment. Don't miss it.<br /><br />Grade: A+
B002JCSWV6|4.0|This was a very good movie.  If their was one living person that I would like to meet, it would be Nelson Mandela.  His courage, ideas and drive brought a country together.  He used anything and everything to work towards unity, this is one method that is very inspiring.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The final entry to the series was highly anticipated despite all the negative comments against it. From the very beginning I did my best to keep an open mind and enjoy the book as thoroughly as I could. To this end the books does have rising action, climax and falling action. The main key points of disappointments are as follows: 1) (possible spoilers*) she complains so much, I understand emotional breakdown, but there is only so much you can take. 2) The love triangle is absurd and excessive at times. You just want both of them to leave her about half way threw. In summation you have to read this if you have read the others just to put it behind you. However if your just wondering here you go:<br />ABSOLUTE SPOILERS****<br />She doesn't want to do it<br />She loves him<br />She does it<br />No wait she loves him<br />EVERYONE dies<br />She gets revenge<br />She is emotionally scared forever.<br />The end
B009ERK1T0|5.0|Bought this album as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend. He loves it and I think Deftones just get better and better.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love it!!! Can't wait till Feb for the next episode. Is the game just as fun? Can't wait for next season to start
0783240236|5.0|the birds ( collectors edition) is just as scary now as it was back when i was a kid,birds,birds,birds they are coming to get you.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|If you like puzzles this game is for you. The beginer levels are great for young kids and the advanced levels would give Einstein fits. I personaly spent the better part of an hour trying to figure out how to complete a level. When I finally figured it out, the solution was so obvious that I was angry at myself for not seeing the answer sooner. That also is the one thing that keeps this game from getting 5 stars from me. Some puzzles are just so difficult you lose interest...............but I always come back for more.

B0058VW36U|5.0|I just can't stop playing this game! Every time I tell myself that this is the last level for today I always end up playing 5 or more levels. The earlier levels are easy enough for younger kids but the higher levels require some thought and a quick finger. This is by far the most enjoyable game I've purchased in a long time.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I've read a number of King's works, and this one is by far my favorite.  King weaves together a tapestry of well-developed characters that the reader can't help but enjoy.  It's obvious that the author did his research in writing this historical fiction.<br /><br />My only complaint about this book is that it did drag on a bit in some places.  It wasn't as bad as the 800+ pages might imply, but I found myself having to press on to stay interested a couple of times.  It's because of that that I am marking this as four stars instead of five (I would mark it as 4.5 if fractional ratings were allowed).<br /><br />All in all, a real delight.  I'm planning to come back and read this one again in a few years.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|love the selection of sounds, and you can layer them. timer function is nice. i miay upgrade to the paid version so it will be able to run in the background.

B00AMBLXP8|1.0|Reminiscent of recent years of Family Guy...the humor has gone downhill and/or disappeared.  I felt the $1.99 rental was a waste.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book keeps you enthralled, and is very sexy, witty, and smart. I would recommend this book to passionate woman who are looking for sexual insight and fantasy. As well as a reading experience that keeps you on your toes.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Fun brainteaser/hidden object/mystery game. I was not able to put it down! Great on the Kindle Fire. I am thrilled to see there are more by this developer.

145210655X|5.0|Bought this for my brother and he absolutely loved it! The book is hilarious and it perfect for Star Wars fans. I will be buying the companion book as well for him. Would recommend,end this for sure.
0780631684|5.0|I loved Final Destination 1 and 2. By the time it reached 3, it had totally deteriorated terms of quality.  Why I liked both one and two is because they both had suspense, lots of unexpected twists and turns and what is going to happen next. Therein lies the key to its suspense. The viewer knows something will happen; we just don't know when. Delicious!  I cook a lot and  and &#34;B&#34; movies are an important and critical part of my cooking experience. &#34;B&#34; movies are good without being a &#34;slasher&#34; movie. Of course there is violence, but not violence foe the sake of violence. A great escapist &#34; afternoon at the movies&#34; movie. Kick back, have your favorite libation and some popcorn and enjoy. Five stars!
B008QE9XD2|4.0|I have always liked Dark Shadows when it was on when I was a kid. To see those actors bring that back was entertaining.
B0015T6G2G|5.0|This was a great story of Mandela's life. The story flows well and it gives a good picture of the things he went through as a man, freedom fighter and liberator of his people in SA. I highly recommend it!

B0044XV3QY|5.0|This box set is stunning. Well worth the money. I recieved it in just a couple of days, well before I expected too. I love that!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This series stands in its own right as good scifi. However, it inevitably will be compared to elements of the backstory of the Fallout series of games. Black Isle and Bethesda explored some elements of postapocalyptic vault psychology but this series managed to surprise me more than once and take the idea in different directions. The books manage to emesh you in the protagonists' world quickly. Enjoyable and well written.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Good book. I really liked it. I think it was well written ans good. Very very good good good good
B002SQNM9A|5.0|Great music by Taylor Swift!  CD arrived on time so it could be enjoyed for the xmas holidays. liked it very much

( they came in third on britain's got talent in 2012).  i listen to \\"forse\\" and \\"the prayer\\" over and over.  beautiful.
B009VA1FN6|4.0|This book kept me turning the pages,it also had a really good twist to it about two thirds of the way through.<br />A really nice Christmas read ,it flowed  from person to person within the storey.
B0073COMKW|4.0|I bought 2 of these (warm white) to go in our guest bathroom.  We have the G7 A21 900 lumen in our own bathroom.  After installation, I have to say that I like the color of these better than the G7. The guest bath has a downward 2 bulb fixture.  I think it's fair to say that these are hot to the touch - should you really be touching light bulbs that have been on for awhile anyway?  I'm pleased with this purchase and will likely buy more.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|If you like hidden object games then this is the game for you. Has a story line also. Graphics aren't bad either.  This is another five star game from G5.

B00AB0AXU6|4.0|I'm not exactly sure what the naysayers were expecting from this film, or from any other film in the franchise really.  From the get-go, round one in the series, there were those that criticized the lack of cohesion from the films to the games.  Yeah?  Well, suck it up.  As a few other reviewers pointed out, the games take days to finish.  How did anyone expect an hour and a half film to condense a weeks worth of game play?  For those that lamented the supposed gaping plot holes, to you I say this: Shut up and enjoy the movie for what it is!  None of these films was ever going to win an Oscar.  You're taking yourselves, and these films, WAY too seriously!  This movie is a joy ride, from beginning to end, for those of us that love the movies for themselves and aren't trying to compare them to the games that inspired them.  I can't play the games in a dark room- they scare me.  But these movies were never meant to do more than make you jump in surprise occasionally.  And this latest edition delivers on that front and so many others.  The action sequences are incredibly well choreographed and mapped out.  Ok, so there's not a lot of character development. Who cares?  The majority of the cast you're already familiar with.  And they even threw in a few extra folks from the games to appease the die-hard fanatics who haven't stopped moaning since the first film.  You even get to see a few familiar faces from the previous films.  I missed Oded.  He's nice to look at.  I missed Michelle Rodriguez- it was just nice to see her in a film again.  And for her to pick up her bad-ass boots and put them back on?  Mores the better!  The plot was simple... but did it really need to be complicated?  There are a few human touches in there to remind us of why we all root for Alice to begin with, besides Milla just being incredibly fun to look at.<br /><br />If you didn't like the film, that's on you.  It's not the film's fault.  I think Resident Evil: Retribution was just what it ought to be.  It was fun, occasionally funny, action-packed, and not nearly as predictable, or plot-hole riddled as some of these critics would have you believe.  If you're that worried about wasting your money, rent it first.  But at least give it a chance.  I only wish I had taken the time to see it in theaters.  This kinda film was made for the big screen. Or Blu-ray.  Mmm.. Milla in leather and HD.  You can't go wrong.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|If you like the Family Guy, you will like this movie.  I am luke warm to the show, because I don't like the random references that don't seem to go with the plot of anything.  This movie had a profanity, drug use, and random references but it worked.  I actually laughed a loud a couple times.
B0055PMURG|5.0|This movie was so inspirational, It really moved me to see how Bethany kept surfing even after her accident. She is definitely an inspiration to us all.

B007UK83S4|4.0|I would be happy just to assign stars. I'm not that keen on writing a review for every book I read.
B0085TKAW6|5.0|Wow!!<br /><br />Just finished reading 'Winter of the World' (second book in a trilogy) and it was a roller coaster of emotion.  Historical fiction that immerses you in the lives of several families across the globe as they navigate their existence through the rise of Nazi Facism,  Spanish Civil War, WW2, Communism and the arrival of the Atomic Bomb.  All of this is done with the intimacy of personal relationships and experience that is underpinned by dated ideals, prejudice and social expectations.  Ken Follet has to be one of the best writers out there....... I do not say this lightly, but I am better for reading this book and cannot wait for the third and final instalment.

B0084AZXKK|5.0|A great story line is completed by well developed characters, a fast moving plot, pirates, moral ambiguities that must be resolved, and the interfacing of a boy with adult personalities.  Seafaring terms, 18th century words, and pirate speak should not deter a young reader from a wonderful adventure.

B002GORUF6|4.0|The Blues Brothers did not disappoint - the movie is a classic for a reason and as a Chicagoan I am glad to check this one off the list. \\"Available in HD\\" links were hard to pass up so I figured \\"why not?\\". Granted, the small text did update to say $2.99 to $3.99 (I checked after the fact) but still, the $1 surcharge was definitely easy to miss. Not a huge deal but enough to knock it down from a 5-star experience to 4 stars.
B005LAIIKI|3.0|Classic Tarantino. Outstanding example of Tarantino movie making technical abilities with an interesting story for a Tarantino vehicle, holding the audience attention for the movie length.<br /><br />Why three stars?  The  horrifying depiction of southern whites makes the racial overtones of Django the 21st Century's equivalent to \\"Birth of a Nation\\" which at the time was considered a technical marvel and interesting story.  \\"Birth of a Nation\\" depicted the Klu Klux Klan as a positive force when confronting \\"uppity\\" and dangerous blacks, the film maker earning revenue from then 1912 racial prejudices (receiving critical praise from then President Woodrow Wilson). So too Django generates revenue from the one acceptable racial prejudice in 2012, prejudice against whites (I wonder if our current President has the same critical praise for Django Unchained as his predecessor felt for Birth of a Nation?).  The character Django is depicted in the movie as a hero only to blacks as he kills American whites male and female.<br /><br />Django is an exhibition of fashionable Hollywood hatred of America delivered brilliantly by Tarantino.<br /><br />The only good white man is a German.  In Inglorious Bastards there are good Germans and there are bad Germans, Germans who are not Nazi and Germans who are Nazi.  No such distinction is depicted by Django.  All southern whites are bad and deserve to die (and they all do die in classic Tarantino style).<br /><br />In Inglorious Bastards Germans choose to be Nazi. In Django, southerners as a group and culture exhibit the racial preference of oppressing and harm blacks, an inbred desire.  Such a depiction of southern whites is blatantly racist.<br /><br />The tragedy of Django is the propaganda of the movie, especially given the politics of 2012.  Just as depicting blacks in \\"Birth of a Nation\\" as bad and the Klu Klux Khan good, so depicting southern whites as bad and a white killing black as a good \\"hero\\" ruins and makes trivial an otherwise good Tarantino movie.<br /><br />1/6/2013<br /><br />An additional thought:  If Tarantino intended Django Unchained as a 21st Century version of Blazing Saddles, then Tarantino failed. Mel Brooks depicted in Blazing Saddles as foolish and silly anyone holding prejudice of any type (including English attitudes toward the Irish).<br /><br />Tarantino's message in Django Unchained appears to be the only good pre Civil War white southerner was a dead white southerner, certainly not the joke presented in Blazing Saddles.  Hopefully Tarantino was not intending pre Civil War white southerners as a metaphor for white America today, though depicting the only good white as a German (presumably without Nazi tendencies) I believe the metaphor was intended.<br /><br />Amazingly, individuals in the movie industry associated with producing Blazing Saddles recently stated the movie with its irreverent depictions of prejudice could not be produced today.  Yet we now have Django Unchained generating revenue from the 21st Century's one acceptable prejudice, condemning American Caucasians.<br /><br />2/17/2013<br /><br />The morality of \\"Django Unchained\\" and \\"Birth of a Nation\\" is no different than the moral justification of Christopher Dorner actions. Killing the innocent is justified by the 21st Century's one acceptable prejudice, condemning American Caucasians.<br /><br />Headline:<br /><br />Has he become a martyr? Thousands of 'fans' still worship [Christopher] Dorner and his 'crusade against government forces'; 20,000 people have joined a Facebook group supporting Dorner; Thousands more have declared support on Twitter using 'Teamdorner'; Experts have compared the Dorner story to a real-life Django Unchained<br /><br />Story:<br /><br />\\".... Marc Lamont Hill, associate professor of English at Columbia University, said Dorner has become a 'real-life superhero to many people.' He told CNN: 'People aren't rooting for him to kill innocent people, they're rooting for somebodywho was wronged to get a kind of revenge against the system. 'It is almost like watching Django Unchained in real life.' ... \\"<br /><br />By Becky Evans, Daily Mail, 14 February 2013<br /><br />[...]' ... \\"    By Becky Evans, Daily Mail, 14 February 2013    [...]
B005WYFLNU|5.0|I gave this gift to my 5 year old niece.  My sister in law was amazed for a little girl who can not sit still for 5 min. she says my niece plays with it non-stop, one of her favorite activities.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|this app is a lot of fun! my children enjoyed watching me play it too. I love sci-fi. and this app was right on!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love it.  it is simple to use. very easy to read. it is also easy to perform multiple functions
B003O86FMW|5.0|I just ate this up in 3 days! I could not put it down when I got the free time. I am going to get the third book so I can put this craving to bed. Awesome book and just makes you want more.
B002KV74ZG|3.0|I think I would have enjoyed this movie a  bunch more if a.) the sound had been better or b:) there had been closed captions. I am admittedly a bit hard of hearing and wear a hearing device, but the music and background sounds were extremely loud and the dialogue was unintelligible. I can get captions thru netflix on my ROKU; why not here on Amazon?<br />That said, I enjoyed the storyline and action... It's one of those cult, fun things.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|This would be a great game if it worked.  I loaded it on my sons kindle and it crashes before I can even start playing.
B007HACDLK|3.0|Have read the whole series and this is another good installment in the Mitch Rapp saga.  A fun read from beginning to end.  A few odd loose ends with minor female characters, but likely they are players in future installments.  The gratuitous profanities drug the story and my rating down a bit.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Interesting story about a dysfunctional married couple. If I ever met someone like the main character I would run the other way.
B00364K6YW|5.0|Came in time for Christmas!! It is one of my favorite versions of pride and prejudice. A must see. !
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|I love this book. It was a really good book. The part I liked best was s when Rowley ate the cheese touch.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This is a great way to pass the time and sometimes a challenge but I love the idea of the game!! Its super fun to play!!
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|Great value for your money's worth. Family oriented movie that keeps the Christmas tradition alive. Must see movie to watch with the kids and the whole family during the holiday season.
B004OZOTSQ|1.0|There was no instructions with the product. I plugged it into my PC, Hooked up the tiny antenna, tried to turn it on using the remote that comes with it and.... nothing. My PC does not see the new hardware or anything. It is useless!!!!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I've read a couple of books about people's near death experiences (NDE) and have found them interesting and very spiritual. This is a well written book with a strong story. As a Christian, you always hope that Jesus will be the central aspect of the person's NDE, but I constantly ask the question - if the core tenant of my faith - the trinity - is correct then Jesus is God the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit and this book in no way refutes that concept. Yet I'm sure many Christians will discount Dr. Alexander's book because it doesn't fit their biblical view of faith.<br /><br />This book made me think about my faith, how to discuss it better with non-believers, and encouraged me for this life and eternity. That is an excellent outcome that is often overlooked by the dogmatic Christians because they have a narrower definition of God than I do.
0307346617|4.0|I really dig the idea of raising the zombie concept to the something more serious and involving the bigger picture. The only drawback is that it left me wanting more and with a feeling that something was missing. So the fourth star is quite small
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Excellent Show, a must buy. Hilarious from start to finish. Cant wait to purchase the next season of this show.
B00AA0TJO8|1.0|This app is fun at first but then it gives u cancer. Frustration cancer!!!!/: ( not a real a type of cancer) uggggg!!

B003L77G6A|5.0|Excellent Show, a must buy. Hilarious from start to finish. Cant wait to purchase the next season of this show.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book is about ROMANCE, respect, and compromise. Very much the 21st century novel. I enjoyed the story line and its finish.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Wow. I mean wow. This app is so addicting! I love brain games because they help me not bite my nails,(do not ever start to bite your nails, even if you have a hangnail! It's so hard to stop!!) And I love that it's free so I can afford it. My mom has only a little money and has to use food stamps and things just for us to eat. My dad got me this kindle fire so I am happy I get to enjoy this app and stop biting my nails, and I am only 11 so plz don't criticize this review like some cruel people who don't care about other people's feelings and are just cyber bullies. Thx
B0042RJWTM|5.0|MONTE WALSH  - Loved the movie when we saw it in early 1970's, and decided it was a movie that I would want to have in my collection.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I know a book is great when it makes me cry, but for the right reasons. I felt so connected to Charlie and I really experienced everything he went through. It was a great journey and I highly recommend it.
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|this is my sons favorite band .. and now he will not stop playing it  .he loves it. thanks you
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book was thrilling,exiting once I started reading I could not stop I can't wait until the house of Hades comes out!!!!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Good luck with the book is trying not to mention that I have to be a great deal of the petition to mention that I have to mention the people who have been in business.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I really loved this book! What a great read..... I finished the book in about 12 hours and I wasn't ready for the book to end. As you're reading you become attached to these characters and you want to know everything you can about them. I love the relationship that Charlie has with his family and I cried when the relationship change between Charlie and his sister because she really needed him. Simply an amazing story and I hope to read more from Stephen Chbosky.<br />I'll be sure to see this movie.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was the best book I read in 2012.  Even though the characters were in a setting unlike anything I've experienced, they were completely believable.  Hugh Howey understands people and societies and created a fascinating story that feels real.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This book and the sequel-are smart and interesting and fun.  Harkness writes well and manages to evoke real human emotions in a fantasy setting.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I read a lot of books in 2012, mostly science fiction, and this was one of the best.  The story was fascinating, but I had this nagging feeling that there was no way the author was going to be able to come up with a plausible explanation for all the elements of the story.  I was very pleased and a little surprised when I got to the end and found that the author DID pull it all together with an explanation for all the strange things the main character had experienced.  I look forward to reading more by Blake Crouch.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This app has lots if variations.  I'll like it even better if I can figure out how to change the tile set.
B002APU580|1.0|When version first came out, I watched it with great anticipation for liking it.  I love Jane Austen, have a Jane Austen related web site, and I am pretty easy to please when it comes to Jane movies.  But I really disliked it.  This past week I thought I would give it another try, and watched it again.  I still really really disliked it. I just think it was poorly portrayed. The Bennet family is made to look excessively poor, grimy and shabby, and not portrayed as the gentlemen's family that they were. Kitty and Lydia were just foolishly, cartoonishly ridiculous, to the point of absurdity. The ball scenes were frenetic and overly crowded, again to the point of absurdity. Keira Knightley's Elizabeth was not likable in any part of the movie - her portrayal was too modern. The entire pace of the movie was too fast - the dialogue was so fast to the point of not being able to understand it at times (and I am not old and I watch British period dramas frequently and so am used to the language). Mr. Bingley seemed a buffoon, which he is not. Mr. Darcy was just never appealing. Their eventually romance seemed implausible.  The whole thing just seemed forced. Jane Austen's subtle humor was never fairly portrayed.<br /><br />It seemed like they wanted give these characters a modern feel while keeping them in early 19th century setting, and it just didn't work. I'm all for modernizations and retelling of Pride and Prejudice, and am a HUGE fan of the Lizzie Bennet Diaries on YouTube.<br /><br />Of course, by far the best Pride and Prejudice portrayal is the Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth 1995 BBC version. Well worth the $4.99 on Amazon Instant Video. [[ASIN:B0083IJWNC Episode 1]]
B003O86FMW|5.0|Awesome book! Very interesting and suspenseful. Could not put it down once I started reading it. Can't wait to read number 3!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It was really good and philosophical blah blah blah I I I I j I h c h v g
B008FSCNTK|3.0|Been a Diana Krall fan for a long time, but this is her worst album, IMHO. She needs to get back to some serious ivory tinkling.
B000W93CHC|5.0|I didn't want it to end.  Now I understand why the separation of church and state was so important to new Americans.  Mr Follett is a great writer.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Great price for three great movies! Grab the popcorn and have a movie fest with your family tonight!  Enjoyed it!
B006O6F932|2.0|For what I paid this should be a LOT better than cheap plastic and cardboard.  It won't even stay up on a carpeted floor.  On a table or hardwood floor it stays up but is not sturdy.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|A fun little game to pass the time.<br />I think that this is a very good app to share with the kids.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|Like most Apple products it's over priced but it works great.  I've has zero issues with it and do recommend it.
B002ECJZ76|5.0|This is one of the most touching Christmas stories you will ever watch. Even if you don't like films that have English dubbed in, the film is done so beautifull and you'll get so completely wrapped up in the story that you'll barely notice the dubbing. There isn't another Christmas movie about Santa Claus that I've ever watched, foreign or domestically made (including our own classics like Miracle on 34th Street), that can touch this one. You'll love it so much that you'll be sure to make it an annual Christmas film-watching tradition.
B005LAIHYU|1.0|At first, i found the intro interesting. Then...then it got ridiculous. The slow motion used in several parts throughout ruined the flow of the film for me. Very exaggerated and overdone, in my opinion. As usual, the book was better!
B00005JM02|5.0|Needed this to replace one that got damaged,  it's a classic and the price was great  ,thank you for your prompt delivery
B003B02PF4|4.0|Interesting tale with enough plot twists to keep you guessing.  Much different from earlier Grisham works, not as much courtroom drama but more real life excitement.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I had gotten the free version of this app and thought it was absolutely amazing. I cant see how this doesn't get a full five star rating from every person who gets it
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Got this for my son for Christmas. It was exactly what he wanted since he is a big Batman enthusiast.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Although I don't like seeing my movie hero's beaten down for most of the movie, I enjoyed the action, suspense, and special effects.
B001E7OO2I|5.0|Very good music to relax to. I enjoy the voice of John Legend. He is a great artist. I look forward to buying more of his CDs.
B00AE2I4WK|5.0|It made me want to get up and dance. Each Step Up movie is great,and this one didn't let me down.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|\\"And may the odds be ever in your favor.\\"<br /><br />With such a big following and a lot of hype, The Hunger Games film was one of the most highly anticipated in 2012. The film lives up to the hype. It is clear that those responsible for producing and making the film come to life wanted to keep the spirit of the book intact, and they accomplish this. With The Hunger Games author Suzanne Collins as one of the screen play writers and director Gary Ross as producer, they are able to keep the novel's vision of a disturbing and backwards society. The film works so well because it demonstrates what an Orwellian, futuristic, dystopian world would look like amid these mindless traditions like the Hunger Games, run by corrupted higher ups. It's a society and world where one must always look over their shoulder; no one is safe. The Games, projected onto society by the means of media and overblown television coverage, create a norm of desensitization to violence. Much like the book was a commentary and criticism of overblown reality television and sensationalism of media, the film follows a similar route, showing the brutality of war, a fight to the death with children as its main celebrities.<br /><br />The film was also terrific from the standpoint of character casting. Jennifer Lawrence really steals the show, and is a perfect fit for Katniss Everdeen. She captures Katniss' personality so well. She is stuck between concern for family and friends close to her in District 12 and being forced to survive the Games. She's presented as a sympathetic character who is emotionally drained from the reality of war, but tries to stay mentally strong. I also thought that Josh Hutcherson did an exceptional job as Peeta.<br /><br />The subtleties and other nuances are also presented effectively in the film. The build up and circus-like atmosphere leading up to the Games are handled perfectly. The mockingjay is introduced as a symbol that will comes into prominence later. There is a perfect blend of foreboding and surrealism both before and during the Games. Clearly, attention to detail was a high priority.<br /><br />Over all, this is a fine adaptation to The Hunger Games, and hopefully Catching Fire will be as good. The quality of the DVD is also superb. Extras in the two discs include a \\"Making The Hunger Games\\" documentary as well as conversation with director Gary Ross.<br /><br />Definitely recommended for anyone who loves the book, or is a fan of dystopian-based films.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|We are an artist bunch in my household. My kids love this pad because they can doodle, paint, add &#34;stickers&#34; make them larger or smaller. This is well worth downloading, and I even got it free! My daughter had to have it on her kindle as well.
0425252868|5.0|Few stories of war reach into you and find that place you always knew was there: the ability to act with honor and courage even under the cruelest of circumstances. War is never pretty, pleasant or in any way in and of itself honorable, but there are those forced into fighting that are. This is what \\"A Higher Call\\" is about. It is difficult to add something new to the previous reviews, to say what hasn't been said multiple times, but this is a great read, not because it is a masterpiece, or a classic, but because it is true. It is a book you can't put down.<br /><br />For those of us whose fathers fought in WW2, and for those of us with our own war stories this is as rewarding an experience as is possible in understanding the difficulty that surrounds military men and women in battle to maintain their humanity, sense of honor and a will to understand why war happens - the one question that has no honorable answer. This is the kind of story that will stay with you, and when you are done pass it on, so others can begin to understand.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|This is a great twist on the angry birds game! My son absolutely loves the angry birds game, and he thinks this is one of the funniest games. I like how the game has you build boxes, etc for the piggies to demolish different items along the way. I will keep it!
B00APUQRPC|3.0|I'll say it was just ok.  I like Eastwood movies, but you can tell they're taming everything down for him just so they can say they have him in it.  On the positive side, Timberlake was better than expected.
B009MCRHH6|3.0|The graphics are great, and I like the concept of the game, but I spent 30 minutes on one level and never was able to complete it. This is a great game for those who like to &#34;build&#34; things. It makes you think more strategically. I guess I haven't been able to do that as of yet! My kids enjoy the game, but they have moved on to something else. They are 7 and 9.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|THIS BOOK WAS SOOOO WELL WRITTEN. LOVED THE STORY LINE. I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN. IST BOOK BOUGHT FROM THIS AUTHOR.
B005I4JG80|4.0|I liked this book, maybe a little more than I expected to. Sure, the writer comes over as indulgent and self-involved. But there is a self-awareness that emerges throughout the book as she absorbs her interactions with French parents, her own parents, and others with whom she comes in contact during her time abroad, that makes her endearing. You come to appreciate her child's charms, and the book is an honest - if not particularly academic - appraisal of some key, anecdotally conveyed, differences between French and American parents. It's not an indictment of either. It's a comparison study. And as an American parent, I liked reading it and thinking about how I relate to my own child.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Couldn't stop reading it. It totally had my attention throughout the entire story.  I can't wait to read the next one!
B003O86FMW|5.0|It's great  so far and  can't  wait to finish. The first book was awesome. I only wish I hadn't seen the movie first
B0046B8GEQ|1.0|A souless remake of The Grinch.  Jeepers, there have o be better family movies.  this movie doesn't warrant six more words
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|It takes me back to piano lessons without the tedious scales.  It's fun.  I can just relax  and let the music flow.  I will be enjoying this every day.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|A wonderful movie that our son wanted for his collection.  It has no defects or problems and plays perfectly.  Thank you.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I don't have anything new to add. It's a great game. I love puzzles like this. The levels have just enough variety to make it interesting, but not so much that it becomes confusing or unsolvable.
1608871045|3.0|The book was a great gift for our son, but 4 of the pages stuck together due to the glue used during production.<br />Another problem is a few pockets for cards & maps/diagrams are too small for hands to get in without tearing.<br />He loves the book and is getting great enjoyment from it but some improvements should be made.

B002HML6Y8|5.0|I originally purchased the DVD version and was impressed. A few years later I decided to try the Blu-ray version and it met all my expectations. I really appreciated the event of Dr. Frankenstein in the beginning in Black and White, it really set the tone for entire movie. So much more can be said about this great movie. The director deserves a lot credit.<br />Nate Bruce
1932100660|5.0|I would highly recommend this book; i believe it is extremely wel researched and just makes good sense!!!!!!!<br /><br />The author is a highly respected nutritional scientist not a fringe dweller with the next &#34;new concept&#34; around healthy eating.<br /><br />It is not overstating it to say that this book has completely changed the way i look at food and it's impact on my health and well being.
B005G5PPGS|4.0|This book was definitely written quite well. I enjoyed reading about the story of Billy Beane. Yes his ideas and theories and his attitude were all strange, he had the determination and the passion to try something that would help make the Oakland Athletics a great baseball team.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is my favorite game. I play it every day. It's great for passing the time. I would recommend to all.
B003ASLJQS|4.0|Well if I was going to ding this at all I would, like most people, do it on the basis of it's ending. The ending without giving anything away leaves one saying well justice wasn't really served. One character's life was horrible and all the way up to the end he was getting screwed over, while other characters got away easy. However for those of us that would give it a bad review because it wasn't \\"fair\\" in the end don't really want to see a true portrayal of life. What I mean is in the movies we tend to like when everything comes together at the end and the bad people get their come-uppings so to speak, but anyone who has lived can tell you that life is not fair. In the end the ending might leave you a bad taste, but it is true to life. Sometimes people just get a raw deal, they get no justice, and then they die. Watch the movie I guarantee you will be entertained.
B004XVN1T4|4.0|love the historical knowledge gained from follet's research  my interest was held fom page 1 to the end  it.s a winner
B008HTQ28K|5.0|After his last novel I was very disappointed with Grisham . Being a European and not familiar with Baseball I found it very trivial but it's good to see Grisham follow up with a book with meat on it . Very enjoyable
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|The puzzles are challenging. I also like how you have the option to okay Monaco to get through so challenges. U also enjoy using certain items to open up more items to complete puzzles.
0817439390|5.0|Just what I needed to further understand exposure. It is really much simpler than I  previously thought. I am glad I found this book.
1423140605|5.0|My 12 yr old daughter loves this series.  She said this book is one of the best in the series.
B00AA0TJO8|1.0|I bought this game and I hated it! Now its free! They should of made it free in the first place!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I was very skeptical about this book, especially with some of the more negative reviews I was hearing. However, after I started reading the first one I could not stop! All three were very good and it was nice to see how the characters grew.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I'm not sure for what reason or why some ppl r saying there is no zoom on the Kindle Fire HD 7 as there is GREAT zoom!! When u r looking 4 ho's, it works just fine!  To that end, I find this game just great fun!  No, it's not for rocket scientists, but, great stress reliever for us moms AND dads or just any1 needing a break from the normal grind of life.  I just got this app; it being New Year's AND I can't stop playing, that should tell u sumthing! (I know, that I have no life-LOL)  But, seriously, if u have played Enigmatics, u will DEF njoy! If u get stuck, hints r rt there and, the best part, u have a twisted-looking \\"sacboy\\" (my son's ps3 game) guiding u!  Just cool, pleasurable fun.....As I rely on reviews myself all the time, i truly hope this helps some 1! I don't think any of us can afford 2 throw $ away on a game we don't want!!  Happy New Year's to ALL!!!<br /><br />Just an additional edit:  Don't hate the game if you aren't a Steelers fan!!!  One has NOTHING to do with the other.  And, to that end, I am a nurse by trade; so, again, it's a game and it's fun, plain and simple!  Don't hate the game because you hate my taste in football!!!! LOL!  Love to all!!!!
B00AMBH70S|3.0|lots of action. exciting but not much of a story. The other Bourne stories were much more interesting to watch.
B009NQKXYK|4.0|There are too many reviews of this movie claiming how &#34;unrealistic&#34; it is.  This is not historical fiction people, it's science fiction.  If you want a fun movie that's action packed with dazzling special effects, check it out.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and plan to watch it again and again.
B000YHG72E|4.0|Just wasn't my favorite movie.  My 34 year old son and his wife would give it a 5 star.  They loved it.
1457514508|4.0|It took me awhile to get into the book, but that's probably my own problem as I like action...and lots of it! But OMG! Stick with it and this book ROCKS! I hope there is a another book...SOON!
B009VB7QQA|3.0|The movie was cheesey and disappointing.  I read the book which I LOVED!  I am glad I didn't pay to see this in the theater.
B00AE2LJVS|1.0|I wanted to like it, but it lacked a real plot and was way too violent and bloody for my tastes. The gore seemed to be the whole point of the movie.
B009HELT3C|3.0|We enjoyed this movie.  I however definitely preferred the original Men in Black.  We love Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones.  They are as always hillarious!
B000W93CHC|4.0|Pillars offers a great archetectural view of the building of old cathedrials and the heart and hard work that might have gone into making them.  While it was a long book, I really enjoyed it.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|As I said it was cute but nothing special. I think it could have been better if TED had to be kept a secret and the world found out.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|App works my daughter loves it . Takes some time to figure it out<br />But keeps her busy. She loves her ponys
B0047Y17P2|5.0|I loved this story.  Michael Connelly made me lose alot of sleep. I'm glad my TV shows were off the air for the holidays so i had more time to read. There were days I didn't even take the time to put on my make up because i wanted to see how the trial was going. My husband would rather i put on the make up then have my nose in my Kindle. The Fifth Witness was a great read and something to think about after your finished. I was looking for another Connelly book right away. He is on the mark everytime. I gave this book 5 stars why don't i see 5 stars on the review?
B001AEF6C2|5.0|Great movie. Takes me back to the eighties. Funny and cool at the sametime. Got this movie from my daughter for Christmas. Love it.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I think there is a nice selection of songs from the movie.  Just enough to remind me of the movie experience.  The song Suddenly is growing on me.  I also have the original London Cast recording, which, of course, is more operatic.  This however is more listenable and tells the story more completely, you can understand the words and story.  Love the french sounds (music and accent) in Master of the House. Thanks.
B001NHNG64|4.0|I am enjoying the Jack Reacher series.  Lee Child is a skilled writer and keeps his audience captivated.  A fast moving book mystery lovers will enjoy.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love this its awesome, great choice for anyone you has technology in their hands all the time! Love this and Highly recommmend it!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|4.5 stars! This author is excellent! I love her writing and I think she is just naturally talented. She writes great dialogue between the main characters & it's original. I'm big on \\"did I believe this couple was in love\\"? YES. I did. There was great anticipation. I couldn't wait for them to get together, and be all the way together(if you know what I mean). Just like the main characters in the Slammed series, I think this author really wrote a couple that were destined to be together due to the tragedies in their lives. Yes, this book has some similarities to some other Y/A books out there, but it was different enough that I didn't find myself comparing them while reading it. It's a tear jerker with some really sad subject matter but definitely worth reading!
B0018QCXH8|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever watched. Daniel Day Lewis is fantastic in this. He is an amazing actor!!
B005WUHAX8|1.0|This case was given as a holiday gift. As soon as it was used the I phone shorted out.  We called the manufacturer and found out that the serial  number on this case was fake.  This \\"waterproof\\" case was a knock off.  Amazpn covered the case .  However we are out one I phone.  Can you please replace the phone??
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Great box set!! Very good price for all the set and extras. Great to watch over and over on blu-ray. This will be enjoyed a lot.

B001UV4XWY|1.0|slow moving and a huge waste of time..... i should have saved my money.....  cameron diaz did not come up smelling of roses
B00AGOGOLE|1.0|This camera is not great. However, we were also initially disappointed that our New HD Kindles did not come pre-programmed with cameras already, since it is one of the items that the new Kindle HD brags about.
B002UZCJ8Y|1.0|bought.... this  because of bruce willis... whom i usually enjoy  but this was so weird, and distasteful  another for the garbage!
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This is the second book b y this author I have read and I enjoyed this book the most.  It was well written interesting and believable.  Would recommend it to anyone
B009VSW15Y|4.0|On New Year's Eve, I could not connect to my camera with this app or any other app.  This app has a user manual and when I E-mailed customer service at Pythion, Jim Henley answered within minutes with 3 E-mails, answering my questions.  The camera was soon fixed with an easy solution that I had not thought of, since I had had this Christmas gift for only a few days.  Thanks, Jim!
B0001AVZA8|4.0|This film is my close friend's favorite movie ever, so I decided to get her the DVD as a Christmas present. She was delighted.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|This book was a quick read that kept me captivated through each of Liz`s journeys. Definitely parts of sadness and happiness but overall a feel good book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have had this game for a few months and haven't uninstalled it yet which is a good thing!!  This game is a great version of temple run that doesn't involve tilting your device.  Works great on the kindle fire, I would absolutely recommend:)
0066620996|4.0|This book has been recommended by many and many professors and colleagues. I now offer my recommendation for this book to you. Get this book!
B003VIWO8Y|3.0|Informative, but short. I just think there could have been more in the book. It concludes fairly quickly. Not bad for the price.
0307887898|5.0|This book helped me to learn the process of pivoting. I am currently using this process to start my own company, and it has helped me avoid costs. Use this process! Use this book!
B004P1YX6M|4.0|Despite of the fact Ingolf Wunder lost the first place in the August Chopin Piano Competition 2010 to the Russian pianist Yuliana Avdeeva, it seems the audience didn't match with the final verdict.<br /><br />Ingolf Wunder exhibited by then and now musicianship, cantabile line and virile lyricism, totally missing in many famed pianists who expose glitter without substance. His phrasing, sense of dynamics and engaging tone (Listen, for instance his Mozart and try to get his recital in Festspielhaus, Baden-Baden October 7, 2012, available in one of the most prestigious classical music blogs of the web) you will note how his limpid tone has a narrow affinity with Ingrid Haebler). His style is far from being a keyboard's lion,(Horowitz). It's more thoughtful and intimate.<br /><br />We are in front of one of the maxim exponents of a good vintage of young pianists (together with Dan Rank, Ilya Rashkovsky,David Greilsammer or Alexander Romanov)who make us a very fortunate generation for having them.<br /><br />Recommended without hesitation.
0545265355|5.0|These books are amazing! Read them for a thrill, some laughs, and maybe even some tears. Hunger Games! Love it!
B003RNXIBK|5.0|I've never bought any music/movie files/formats online before until this one. It works great!!! And at such a reasonable price I love it.
B00ARI9CDQ|5.0|I love the tablet app. It's much more user-friendly than the phone app, and is easier on the eyes and more organized than the website. Great job!
B008EZVNO0|5.0|One of his best! I recommend it to all of Van Morrisons fans and new fans. It was my husbands favorite Xmas gift.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|If you are not familiar with Donald Fagen, he is half of the creative genius behind Steely Dan.  Heavily jazz-influenced and with the highest production value in the industry, this offering showcases outstanding studio musicians.  Fagen's voice is iconic (ear-conic?) and easily recognizable for its unique tone.  How can he sound this good at 64?  Because of the quality of the sound engineering and the rich harmonies and rhythms involved, I suggest you buy this on CD as opposed to musical download.
0316228532|2.0|Although the writing is impeccable and the characters detailed and real, I was disappointed with this book.  There is no character that I felt like I could root for, they were all too flawed.  I had a difficult time getting through all the endless descriptions of small time gossip.  I only hoped that the ending would justify the time I spent reading the rest of the book.  Unfortunately, even though I cried at the end, the resolution was not entirely satisfying.
0061537969|5.0|I loved this book gave itto several friends to read, including a friend who had to sent her dog to find his cloud. It helped her a great deal.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|His books are good reading but and the plots are different in each book.  He can write books that span from sentimental to exciting and they are all well written.and enjoyable
B000TGJ8IU|5.0|Gift for my husband for Christmas. The extra footage really adds to the whole movie. It was a big hit!
B008KW43TE|5.0|Album is amazing. Friends heavily recommended and it did not disappoint! Could very well be my favorite album of the year.
B008FSCNTK|5.0|I am a fan of the earlier work of Diana Krall, with for me a personal favorite the Live in Paris album and songs.<br /><br />BUT: i love this new style as much. I am pleasantly surprised, but can imagine not every fan of Diana Krall will agree on this. The relaxing tone, the ambiance and the the whole feel of the music is working very well for me.<br /><br />The fact that people want Diana to recall a CD/Vinyl record just because they do not appreciate it is showing a total disrespect for the artist and gor everyone who DOES like this music. If you don't like it: don't listen to it! MNake sure you know what kind of music you are buying. I do never recommend anyone to buy any record without listeing to it first!<br /><br />(sorry if there are grammar mistakes, I am from the Netherlands, and English is therefore not my first language)
B004SDSSFY|4.0|I've used this app for a while now and it's the best one I've found so far. Their version of Word is the most intuitive and easiest one out there.<br /><br />One issue I have is it says there should be the ability to make and edit PDFs but there isn't. That's frustrating since PDFs are useful and it's a promised feature.<br /><br />If they fix that issue then it'll be a 5 star app!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this app it is so additive and not really insanely. hard so I got it a few days ago and I'm on 8&times;8.Get this app.

0307389839|5.0|Let me preface this review with the fact that this is the first thing I've read by Murakami and that I've read a lot of sub-par reading books. Hopefully this will excuse my enthusiasm.<br /><br />What I Liked:<br />- As someone who runs and writes I thoroughly enjoyed the marriage of the two topic in this book<br />- I appreciated the subtle motivation without the instruction manual feel<br />- That someone has written about running well; so many running books have sloppily written prose. This one retained a slightly formal, yet fluid feel.<br />- His honesty in regards to aging and his sub-par triathlon performances.<br /><br />Drawbacks:<br />- There were some parts towards the middle that were a little slow, but not horribly so. But, then again, so is training- there are always highs and lulls to books, just like the miles you put into a marathon.<br />- For a memoir, I felt that I didn't really \\"get to know\\" Murakami. I definitely respect his privacy, but I didn't feel a sense of, I don't know, kinship, that I do when I've read others.<br /><br />Great read- definitely recommend.

B009MCRHH6|2.0|'World of Goo' is a construction game where the player connects goo balls together to form towers, bridges, etc. to transport free goo balls to an Exit Pipe in each level.<br /><br />To the creator's credit, the concept seems solid and the variations on this concept are impressive. There are multiple types of goo balls with different properties. And there are a variety of obstacles to prevent the levels from becoming boring. However, I just didn't like the game.<br /><br />This product is frustrating. No matter how I try, I cannot create a vertical tower of any significant height and that is the goal for half of the first dozen levels. The goo balls are simply not balanced from a development standpoint. They are too gooey and not rigid enough. The levels also run the gamut of difficulty with the first being relatively easy but quickly becoming far too challenging. Finally, the behavior of the goo balls roaming over the structure means they are always in the way making building tedious to say the least. The author has conveniently included a \\"Skip Level\\" command but it's seems more like a bandaid for a poorly designed product than a feature.<br /><br />My interest in construction games such as this began with the excellent X-Construction which I found in the Android market for my DroidX phone. Having recently purchased a Kindle Fire HD, I was hoping for a similar fun experience.

B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|In the blu-ray. One person commented about the gut scene. I don't know what he is refuring to but the people did drag a body out of a alley and did smear the dead persons guts all over their body so the zombies would think they were dead. I have one comment. I never saw the show on AMC. I thought Zombies ONLY ate people? Not animals? Great Zombie show. Love it.

B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Jack Ryan Jr is taking over for the old man, Jack Sr in the White House.  And doing one heck of a job at it. Clancy's story is a page turner and up to the standards of &#34;Hunt for Red October&#34;.  Well written and interesting plot twists with not too much boiler plate make this book worthy.  While the combat segments are realistic, the real thrill is in the cyber warfare area.  As the world evolves away from mechanical warfare, Tom lets us know what's coming our way and alerts us to get our IT act together before it's too late.  Bravo sir, I'm awaiting the next installment of the Jack Ryan Jr franchise.

B009HEJXFS|4.0|I enjoyed the movie but my husband was not into it due to some of the parts being too emotional and not enough action. I do think the first two MIB movies were better but this one still was better than most choices out there these days.

B008GXHOFW|3.0|I got in a high level in the game and almost beat it, then I tried my gameloft account. Then when I went back to the game it restarted. All the way from the beginning, it was really upsetting because it was really close to the end. That is why I rate it a 3 star.

0525952616|2.0|Lots of techno-chatter with a serious dollop of Stupid.<br /><br />It's worth noting that people with an intuitive understanding of human nature can learn to master the elements of the digital world. But people who are intuitively \\"digital\\" seem to find it very difficult to grasp the landscape of human nature (maybe the randomness throws them off).<br /><br />So Suarez - who can toss off knee-deep techno talk without any visible effort - assembles characters from what appears to be just lists of foibles. They're just stick figures. And there's no real reason for any emotional reaction when something good (or something bad) happens to them.<br /><br />Lack of any persuasive personalities means that it just gets sillier as it goes, and - if you're traveling - you'll probably want something else on your Kindle besides this.

B0051MKNV8|4.0|There really isn't much I can say about this movie that hasn't already been said by many other reviewers. I didn't really expect a whole lot from this movie, but I found that I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's interesting to imagine what people would be capable of if they really could use the full potential of the human mind. Would it just be a mattter of heightened senses? The ability to rapidly scan and absorb and process information? The ability to mentally construct complex patterns, systems or ideas in short amounts of time? The ability to solve almost any problem? Or would it allow for almost super-natural powers such as telekinesis or telepathy? Who really knows? At least this movie does a good job exploring that concept and does it in an entertaining way. This is one I will definitely watch again. Very intriguing!

B0051OZ564|1.0|This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  It felt like a bunch of adolescent boys got together and asked, \\"What do we like in a movie?\\" and then filmed scenes with those things in them and just threw them together with some plot line that unsuccessfully tried too hard to be profound.  In the end it leaves absolutely no investment in the characters.  I just wanted everyone to die so I could go home.  Ridiculous and painful. The only redeeming factor was a decent soundtrack.

B001ANSSDC|5.0|Hard book to put down. Finished in 3 days. There's enough mystery to keep you wanting to find out more about how each character is going to or has affected the behavior and/or actions of the main character. The main character is very flawed, but you root for his happiness.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|This made a great Christmas present! The quality of each episode and packaging are very nice as well. Definitely a must have for any fan of the show!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I loved this story.  I had heard many good things from friends, but for some reason I never read it.  Every time I looked at it on amazon.com I thought the book cover and info about the book wasn't that appealing so I kept putting it off. I am SO glad I finally read it... it is excellent and shocks the heck out of you several times!!! Point of Retreat, the second novel,is just as good.  I finished both books in one day that is how much they suck you in!
1423124111|5.0|This book is very well made and includes just about every poster used in any of the Disney Parks! Great to see Haunted Mansion (and others) in different languages and styles. The book is also a good bit larger than most books making for an awesome coffee table book filled with truely inspiring artists. If you are a fan of any Disney Park, you should totally pick this one up!
B00001NTXN|5.0|What a fun and creative game!  I love this one.  It is so challenging.  You can easily play this game over and over again without getting bored.  Great buy for the whole family.
1469984202|5.0|I purchased this book because it had lots of great reviews and was cheap. It also turned out to be the best dystopian future novel I've ever read.<br /><br />I don't remember the phrase \\"dystopian future\\" being used when I was a teen, and a check on Google's ngram viewer shows that it wasn't; the use of the phrase in print has skyrocketed in the last 30 years. But the terms is a good one, describing the opposite of a utopian future.<br /><br />There are so many reviews on this series that I will only add a couple of comments. Although this omnibus edition is a series of five shorter \\"books,\\" together they comprise a novel. I thought when I first started reading that I was going to be reading a collection of short stories written around a common theme. This isn't the case. That said, the first book can be read alone as a short story, albeit with a disturbing ending. As a stand alone it had a bit of the tone of The Lottery by Shirley Jackson that all of us read back in eighth grade. (And of course, The Lottery surely inspired The Hunger Games!). In fact, The Lottery seems to have a certain influence on the author of Wool, although it is more subtle.<br /><br />You might consider reading book one and then waiting a day or two to read any further. If you are like me it will gnaw at you a little bit. After that, I have to say it's hard to put the book down.

0345803485|1.0|This was a horrible book with poor writing style and a complete lack of evolution or character development.  I am angry at everyone who made me think that this was a steamy love story.  It was an incredibly, incredibly long book in which not much happens.  E.L. James did spend a few extra minutes with the so-called intimate scenes but even they left a lot to be desired.  Don't waste your money on this book. it did however teach me a valuable lesson about giving in to the hype.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Great product. My daughter is very pleased.  we've been having a Harry potter marathon,  excellent price and arrived as expected.

B005LAIHXQ|4.0|A great science fiction tale!  Storyline, special effects and acting all first rate! Glad to have it in our library.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put it down. I was living the story with the characters. A must read. I totally recommend it.
B008YU0AOE|4.0|Somedays my heads too full of a gazillion other things to perform yes, even basic math. I don't want a scientific calculator that has 1200 buttons... this one is easy to read (love the clean,  large buttons), simple to use and gets right to the basic point of what a calculator is.  Its one we offer at work on government issued devices, staff have asked for it. When I needed one for my home device I went looking for it!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I really liked because it is so different from the movie I got confused. But never put the book down
B0097GVJWQ|2.0|Initial set up is cool and the graphics seem decent. But past that I've hit a couple glitches where you're supposed to tap screen for next step and the game freezes completely or just reverts to something I've already done but it now doesn't recognize and wanted to make me recreate a bunch of steps. Tech support was great at resolving glitches quickly but it &#34;ruined the mood&#34; so to speak. The help button isn't much help... after collecting all the evidence possible, the character still could not move to additional screens so was stuck in same spot over and over. The help button didn't offer any suggestion other than point to a direction my character should go to but since she was frozen and unable to move towards it I've not been able to finish game. Too many glitches but for $3 I guess that's the norm?
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is the first book I have ever read by Colleen Hoover and it won't be the last!!!! So much emotion and detail that kept me wanting more and more! :)
B000WC3864|5.0|Bought as gift to complete set of movies.  My daughter's boyfriend loves Bruce Campell so I bought as a gift.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game has amazing graphics, and It keeps me playing all day long. I am so glad I bought this game. Keep up the good work Gameloft!
6305841861|5.0|Bought as a gift for my daughter's boyfriend, he loves this series.  I was hoping to be able to find all movies in series together.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I've choose this rate because I like the ( Oxford Dictionary of English )<br />I liked the words and the dislike was the beginning part<br />I would recommend this book to Abigail Jimenez Alexis:):):):):)
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I find this game to be a blast. I like the way the game is set up and flows. Lots of fun. Highly recommend.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Loved the movies. This collection was perfect to upgrade my dvd's to blue ray. I thought this was a perfect end to the Nolan triology
1400030293|3.0|Strange and somehow depressing...,especially as it was semi- autobiographic. It illustrates how obsessive and<br />addicted this woman allowed herself to become. She behaved like an artists muse. The man did not deserve such devotion.<br /><br />GORDON....Edith Templeton
B000K8EQ5W|4.0|a playful romantic/fantasy movie. I liked watching the two main actors in this film. Wife say it for the first time and thought it was fun
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is pretty fun. good game to pass time. but you have to earn the points to unlock tje other games.
B0095P31L6|5.0|The animation in this movie is amazing. Rango is a really good movie. Its not for kids, but I really enjoyed it!! Give it a try.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|One of the best and I will buy the rest of his works.<br />I have missed writhing of this caliber.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book isn't just for teens! It was hard to put down. There was lots of suspense and the potential for romance.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|Well I really like the book and zoo- wee mama to all u diary of the wimpy kid lovers the only way I can read is if they are diary of a wimpy kid books
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love it!<br />Great design! Develop your skills. Good eye coordination game for kids with no violence. Go for it!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I like it it is awesome. it rocks. love to draw. it is great .have a nice day I hope u like it
B001UGB1X8|5.0|The plot is very well written, the bad guys well concealed.  Not an inordinate amount of twists, but they give you just enough information to keep guessing throughout.<br /><br />Very worth watching!
B0076DELIG|3.0|Enjoyed the book and the series. However, you know the formula and it is predictable. That is not bad and there are times when complicated and dense are not needed. It's easy to pull for the hero and want the bad guys to get caught as the always are.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app works great on my kindle.  It is extremely easy to use as well as being really detailed with daily and hourly forecasts.
B008YRVW0I|4.0|I have this game on my computer and I love it. its so much fun and you can play it over and over without getting bored. The only drawback is the size. It is a little hard on the eyes. I noticed that there is space on both sides and perhaps it could be stretched a bit. and enlarged a little. Otherwise it is really great.
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|Jack Reacher is a fantastic action/detective experience with masterful cinematography by Caleb Deschanel and Christopher McQuarrie.  Honestly, I feel that anyone who doesn't like this movie simply doesn't appreciate visual storytelling through photography, the roaring engine of a classic Camaro, or hero action movies in general.  I found Jack Reacher to be smart, engaging, and entertaining.  Loved it.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I'm really glad I started with the first one. Well written, good to great characters, some details a bit too expanded but it does not take away from the story. You can't help but like Jack.  He really is more than just a man of action. I look forward to reading them all!
B00993FEUK|5.0|While modern animated films have done a great job of appealing to kids while including humor that will go over the kids' heads but give us adults a laugh, Paranorman almost seems at times like an adult story told in an animated childrens' movie! Kids who love scary movies and Halloween time will definitely love this (it's less cartoonish in tone than Hotel Transylvania and heavier on the 'horror' themes), but, like Monster House, it may be intense for other children. I know my nephews were spooked at times, but they still wanted to watch even when they were hiding behind pillows!
1419705849|5.0|My 6 and 8 year old grandsons love this series of books.  They have the set and were eagerly awaiting this new addition which I gave them for Christmas.  Anything that gets them excited about reading is great in my book!
B005HSL626|4.0|I like this game I just wish you would not have to buy the full game to unlock more options
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|realistic movie with very life like situations , look and listen it will warm your heart and maybe even give you a couple tips about your life
B00AECGQF2|3.0|My 4 year old loves her kindle. We bought this game and it held her interest for a few minutes. There are only 2 girls and 2 boy characters to do hair for (not much of a selection). For 1.99 it's ok but 10 minutes after purchasing it we were ready for the next thing.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|to me was ok -unrealistic action movie with extraordinary human feats (impossible) guess i might be a bit old fashion but that is my opinion
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|I was disappointed when I got a new kindle, the old dictionary did not transfer over, but all the books I had did??????????
B0016OM3TU|5.0|Every time I play it I feel as if I am physically in a Jazz Club.  It always meets my needs and expectations.
B0091LRZZW|5.0|Loved the PBS broadcast.. Had to supply all  adult children Many of my favorite artists in support.Especally Walsh, Krall & Clapton,
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|Dark drama for sure, but AHS is like a great book, you can't stop watching! Jessica Lange is fantastic. Each season is different, but with the same great cast.
B000641MB6|5.0|This is an awesome movie shown in black and white. Brought back so many great childhood memories. Definitely a must buy!
B005X5XIL0|5.0|He is such a beautiful singer with great range.  I love the variety of people that he chooses for duets.  I have never been disappointed in any performance of his.
B00AECDDYY|5.0|really enjoying this game.  been a long time since ive bought a decent game and this one does not dissapoint!
B00009RDGA|5.0|this movie was incredible!!!<br />no wonder its an award winning film.<br />way ahead of its time with the little girl.<br />this film could be remade and be a hit,<br />the period cars and clothes, the stage quality<br />acting, the django sounding music, its a work<br />of ART!!!!!!!! one of our best american films.<br />Teens and above!!!
B008IZ5X5Q|5.0|just finish watching season 6, best investment i ever done. can't wait to buy season 7. best show ever!! love it.
B007N31ZLA|5.0|great acting, storyline, awesome soundtrack and costumes,<br />this is my favourite all time movie.  the cars and the great<br />supporting cast alone.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Now don't get me wrong, I love the 50 Shades Trilogy as well but I could not put this book down and cannot wait until the 3rd book is released in May!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|A far step forward in the missle defense games.  I play this one on my Android tablet and have had no issues with force closing or lagging.  Recommended to anyone thatnenjoys the missle defense series.  Big bonus is the ability to rebuild your city and upgrade missles for your defense.
B00633W614|4.0|The Sins of the Father was very entertaining and I was surprised with the<br />ending, now I await the next addition to The Clifton Chronicles.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Mentioned a lot of books I wanna read now , had a great mood in the whole story will definitely read it again
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Immediately drew me in and captivated my attention.  I could not put the book down.  Skillfully written with great imagination.  Almost afraid to see the movie for fear it will not meet my expectations.
0439023491|4.0|they get out alive only to be thrown back in all over again!! I like the first book a bit better but all in all it was very good. I loved getting to know all the other previous Game Winners.
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|I have enjoyed many of Pixar's movies, but this one was just ok for me.  The animation is always great and it was a good story.  However, it lacked the humor and fun that so many of Pixar's movies incorporate into the story,
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I Really liked this one. I liked it even more  than the first book in the series. During the book things are happening that don't make sense until the very last chapter. The ending was so clever I actually went back and read it a second time immediately to see all the twists and how they made sense once you knew what happened.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I LOVE IT!!<br />I was hooked at season one, episode one which I only saw last week!  I try to limit myself to one a day but it's hard.
B00877R85I|5.0|It's about time there's a kick ass survived as female lead!!! It's about time the woman gets to be the hero in a love story! Makes woman all over the world wanna learn archery!
B005T87QCI|5.0|Cool graphics+a bunch of unlockable character s+3 tournament modes=cool game get it nnnnnnnnnoooooooowww it's worth it plus there are no ads
0425263908|3.0|overall I did like this book. I liked enough to read the next book in the series which was MUCH better than this one.<br /><br />But the whole romance seemed rushed. I felt there just wasn't enough story development to get me to buy in to the couple.<br /><br />I will say book two is very good so all in all its worth reading this one because of how good book two is.<br /><br />can't wait for book three to come out
B00797MB0O|1.0|this film is a family classic favorite. while watching it we were reminded of of such blockbusters such as the wizard of oz and fargo.<br />my family were inspired by the action and the adventures of the jador dior. NOT!!!!<br />reading the toilet bowl comments truely made watching this movie worth while.<br />watch paint dry while jumpping a pile of rocks hoping for a snake wouldve been more thrilling.<br />It was like watching a bad car crash that you couldnt turn away from.
159413586X|4.0|I really loved this series! So worth reading a couple of times. I loved having female lead that can hold her own with the men. But parts of the ending left me feeling slightly cheated.<br /><br />Prim and not having any answers there and Gale ....I just loved him so much he was her partner in hunting and in war for many many years. And then poor it's over where is he what is he doing and how can she not care????
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I bought this book because a friend of mine suggested it to me and I loved it!<br />Awesome must read for teens
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is exhilarating. There is not much more to say about it. This book makes you care  about Katniss. Also about who she will end up with Gale, or peeta. In about 2 minutes I will be buying catching fire. Amazing book. Blows the  twilight saga out of the water..
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Don't expect much, just enjoy!<br /><br />Fun characters, enjoyable plot. But not an intelligent read or mentally challenging book. Grab a cup of coffe and you will be done in 3 hours.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|His book truly is beautifully heartbreaking. It's full of heartwrenching love and friendship. HOPELESS is an emotional rollercoaster you won't want to put down.
0316098515|3.0|I've perused this book and eaten at the restaurant, as well.  While Humm is a talented chef, his cooking techniques for individual components should not be trusted.  For instance, he instructs readers to blanch asparagus in water until cooked.  More knowledgeable chefs, however, have figured out a LONG time ago that it helps to supplement the blanching water with asparagus trimmings (this precludes characteristic odorants from being leeched into the water) along with other ingredients to improve flavor, color, and to speed up cooking time.<br /><br />This book is good for plating designs and flavor pairings, and nothing more.  Repeat - do not follow the techniques outlined in this book for cooking individual components on a dish.  For that, I would recommend The Modernist Cuisine (or the \\"At Home\\" version), On Food and Cooking by Harold McGee, or any of Heston Blumenthal's books.<br /><br />As far as originality and creativity go, David - you still lack \\"Miles Davis\\" (he's still struggling in that regard).
B004QX07G4|4.0|This was a fun and easy read. I read it on a plane ride and it was just the right amount of interesting topics a silly comments  and observations to make the flight go fast. And true to form it reads just as though Ellen herself is sitting right next to you  talking.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is a great App, I've had a lot of fun using it. You get to interact on a smaller level, yet share the things you enjoy with others.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyable. This was my very first ebook for my Kindle Fire He and it didn't disappoint.It helps that the book was free but I would have easily purchased it and look forward to reading more from this author.
B002VECM4A|4.0|we first saw it on the Oprah network,and decided to see it uncut and without commercials every 2 minutes. It draws you right in to the characters. Really good job by the whole cast. I will watch it again. Caution about the language for younger viewers. It paints a very clear picture of things wrong with inner cities.
B00A757EFW|3.0|Can't make the game controller work like I think it should.  It responds too slowly to my commands.  Maybe I just need to get used to it.
B007Q0K9TE|1.0|I really enjoy Andre Rieu and can listen to his music for hours.  However, this dvd was bought as a Christmas present. It skips badly and makes viewing next to impossible.  Disappointed that I'll have to return it and hope another one is available!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Got this game because I had seen it played but had never played it myself.  It is somewhat entertaining and my grandkids will like it.
B002Q1YDLI|4.0|In this book, we get to see Darcy's side of the story.  While this book will not be winning a Pulitzer anytime soon, it is a fun read and I appreciate that Darcy as seen in SOmething Borrowed is not instantly transformed into the sweet, innocent, victim.  she is still as self obsessed as ever on her own journey.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Amazing all off the books better than the last! This was the best by far, as exciting a read as a movie.
078693123X|5.0|Love the Drizzt line of stories. So good I read more than once. These hardcover copies are replacing my paper backs. The hardcovers have beautiful art that captures the Drizzt world amazingly.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|Words too big I hate it never good book Pennsylvania people who served in Vietnam hate reading so junk junk junk<br /><br />Love,<br />Grandma vikie
B000SEGMAU|5.0|I read this book for the first time about 10 years ago, loved it then.  Just read it again and loved it even more.  Excellent read.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I really do enjoy the Wimpy Kid series.  I think they are fun and have good and simple morals to them.  I don't think that this book had any real \\"pizaz\\" as opposed to the other books.  Although it was entertaining it seemed to lack surprising moments that could catch the reader off guard.  However, it was, overall, a fun story to read
B006VREHRS|4.0|not a full 5 star because of the violence- love the choice of Buscemi for the lead as he is not an obvious choice for his character
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I normally am not one for romance novels, but this book kept me wanting more with every turn of the page. I kinda figured the bedding out, but the way it all played out was not what I expected.
B009ZQGNPQ|5.0|I just can not wait to see season 4, the wait is killing me. Season one was great, season 2 even better and so was the 3rd, it keeps getting more interesting and exciting. At first I didn't think I'd like the show at all but I got hooked quickly. The costumes, the stories, every detail absolutely perfect. Also, great way to learn about history. I highly recommend it.
0812993292|2.0|In the hands of a better writer, this story might have been redeemed. But as it is, The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry is frankly not worth reading: the writing is mostly weak and uninspired, the story too much like a daytime drama, the characterizations not convincing. I wanted to like this book, and finished it despite myself, but in the end felt cheated: it was a waste of my time. For an example of a sharply written book, with believable characters and true poignancy and redemption, and a pilgrimage to boot, read David Lodge's Therapy; it's a quantum step above this novel.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I have read almost all of Nicholas Spark's books and I'm not surprised that this book was just as amazing and captivating as the others were. He is a fantastic writer and it suits him well that love stories, I believe, are his specialty. I loved this book just as much as the others I've read. Bravo Nicholas Sparks!!
0062119044|1.0|Combine a bizarre mother who hates her child from pregnancy on yet who is presented as a normal woman, a father who happens to see none of his son's evil viciousness for 17 years, and a child who makes Rosemary's Baby look like the Gerber Kid.<br />This book entails a cast of characters too unearthly to be swallowed, but who the author tries to pass off as believable.  Not recommended for anyone.
B009MO57H6|3.0|I am a fan of the resident Evil films.They are fast paced and fun.I loved the way this one took you backwards ,to how the last film finished.I also liked, how some of the old cast got brought back in to the story. I agree with some of the other people, in that the whole story line needs spiced up. Perhaps now,that she has the virus in her again, we will see some of her awesome super powers in the next film. The story does need to be heading somewhere, and at the end of this film,it shows a final show down.This of course seems to happen in every film. I still love the non-stop action,and even though this one did skip around a bit ,it was not that hard to follow. It is still very good ,for an occult film. One does not go to these for a great story line, or dramatic effect..please. She kills zombies...her friends kill zombies, and the umbrella corp...this is not brain surgery.
B00APUYN0I|4.0|Enjoyed it funny movie Just watch it and laugh.<br /><br />Once is enough viewing this movie.  Musical good for family laugh
B0015DROBO|5.0|It's a great murder mystery, a little slow in the beginning though. There's some gruesome topics, and the descriptions can get pretty graphic. Other than that it's very intriguing!
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|i thought this game was fun and exciting i just wish their was more levels!! great game for young and old!! if you like tlo let your imagation flow then this is the game for you! i got it free thanks !! :)
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|This movie is so much more than the great trailers. Well done - we couldn't stop laughing.  The accent truly made it.
B005RAO0GS|5.0|Just Excellent quality in the sound combines with the strong writing and performance make this an MP3 to add to your collection.
B000000OTU|5.0|I had this CD before and lost it. Very upset about that, but very excited I could find and purchase it again.  Love every song on it!!
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|I really like the show. I only hope that the next episode will hurry and be posted so that I won't forget the series altogether.
B0053O89IS|5.0|I love the series of Bones.  I have every year of this series.  Can't wait to watch the 7th season.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Very good!  Good second book in the series. Looking forward to book three and beyond.  Authors have a good grasp of teenagers thought processes.
B00063F8B2|5.0|my son listens to it 24 /7  he just loves it. sings every song on there by hard. would recommened it for any kid.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I seen Tim on Fox News and decided to get the book .Im glad I did the book is everything, it's a self help book a cook books hunting gathering book and a book that will surprise you .
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|my sons loves it  he sings every song by hard . and makes an concert out of it. this is the best cd that he has ever gotten.
B003UYUQZW|5.0|awesome movie, one of my son's favorite. action packed, adventure with lots of fighting just exactly what he wanted, great value
B007EECSFA|5.0|Just finished \\"The Secret Keeper\\" by Kate Morton.  Up until this point,  \\"The Forgotten Garden\\" had been my favorite book of hers.....probably my all time favorite book!  Kate Morton's ability to transport the reader back in time with senses working in overtime, makes the reader feel like they are living the story along with the characters.  Her descriptive prose shapes the characters and their environment to the point that the reader longs to be part of the story, instead of an invisible observer.  Her ability to weave a tale from the past to present and back again, gives the reader a mystery they long to solve.<br /><br />I also appreciate her talented use of the English vocabulary, always learning new words, such as garrulous, obfuscating, verisimilitude, prescient, and ignominious, for example.  Following this story is like playing a musical score full of majors, minors, sharps, and flats propelling the reader on and on longing to participate in the experience of the creation.<br /><br />I've never written a review before, but I passionately recommend this book to any level of reader.  Take your time when reading and soak up all that it has to offer.
B009OA57MI|1.0|This is a rip off, I can not open the game without it freezing up my kindel. The creater should atleast refund our money back.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This was definitely fun to play. Only wish the HOG parts had more hidden objects. The other puzzles were fun as well.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Quick but deep read! Loved it and couldn't put it down! Highly recommend this book. All ages would enjoy this.
B001N26GFM|5.0|This film is interesting for so many reasons. One thing that makes it stand out is the fact that the story is told from the family of a Nazi commander. It is very well done.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I've never played a game like this before. I started out playing the free version and got hooked on it, so I paid the $ 1.99 to keep playing. It was a great, spooky mystery. The graphics and story lines are amazing. I just wanted to keep playing it. Great job!
B005COO1X6|2.0|Sorry I spent so much on this.  It's a quick read and ends suddenly.  Not worth what I paid for it.  It just isn't developed, almost like a draft of a story.  I'm deeply unsatisfied.
B000M341RI|4.0|It is a very entertaining and funny movie. Respectful fun and not offensive or too much dirty language. It is a movie that one can enjoy with a variety of people
B00846REIS|5.0|Very good book, it was really similar to Fifty Shades, but less weird bedroom stuff~ I really enjoyed reading this!  would DEFINITELY recommend this book!
B009Y2KGSQ|3.0|Aerosmith is one of my FAVORITES....But this one is far from OK. It is just MEH. They had their run in the music world and are still one of the greats but, this CD just doesn't have the old Aerosmith sound to it. Joe still plays the guitar really well and Steve is Trying to keep it to the roots but I dunno the songs just try to grab a new audience and a new sound to it and just don't sound as good. Just my oppinion, But if you want a good album by these guys download &#34;Get a grip&#34; or their &#34;greatest hits Albums (2 disc set)&#34;. They are the best ones.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|First at all, the app should come with the kindle already. Come on, bring camera but not apps, ridiculous. I bought the app and then the photos are a bad, bad , bad quality, no even are HD. They are cheap.
B005IA9K2G|5.0|This is an excellent movie. A classic for the DVD library. Love the anniversary edition. This was an excellent purchase.
B008KE3960|4.0|you can blow a couple of weeks with this game. It's a lot of fun. Your basic tower defense game.
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|The authors went too far into impropriety this time. Much too gross and disturbing for my tastes. Maybe they are running out of ideas?
B004HX4RT6|4.0|the best part of this app is that it's free. Really good app for a free app. It actually has different difficulty levels.
0898159156|5.0|This book is very informative.  Have the same name as the 90s band made me a bit nervous but I knew I loved it from the start.
B009LK6JS2|3.0|There really isn't much to do in this game, you will be done in 20 minutes. But the actual game play is really good.
098555780X|5.0|This is a great book for beginners and those who what to do some knots that are more advanced. It is in color and has easy to understand instructions. This book arrived fast in perfect condition and i was very impressed by this seller.
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|it was pretty good, and worth watching once. Probably not ever again though. It's your typical high dollar blockbuster. Words.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|Very fun and entertaining, pleased with my purchase, enjoying playing, wish that maybe there were more puzzles but for 2 bucks I can't really complain.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|Given that it is free this is a terrific app for the price. An assortment of quality, realistic sounds, adorable graphics and an easy-to-use interface, this app is good for relaxation, meditation, and maybe even inspiration.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|The fourth movie by the Kendrick brothers is very inspirational.  I thought it was a little sadder than it needed to be, but Romeo and Juliet is still popular and it's sad.  :)  Thanks for getting the movie to us quickly and in perfect shape.
0545425115|5.0|i bought 3 of these for christmas gifts and was pleased with everything. they were just as described and a fantastic deal. thank you.
B001P06GX4|5.0|You had the best price on this game and it arrived in perfect shape.  Thanks for always being there for us.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I bought 3 of these as stocking stuffers and they worked perfectly. Everything was just as I expected and everyone was happy.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|It is really fun and cool how u can draw it own stuff. I also luv how u can draw it own characters.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|I bought 3 of these for stocking stuffers and they worked perfectly. everything was just as described. thank you. A+++
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Ok..so I bought the book because of the new movie.  I was curious to see what the series would be like before I see the movie.  It was a good action read that kept my interest and went pretty fast.  I have the second one in my list to read as well, but still not sure if I love the series yet or not.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was fantastic. It was possible the best book I have ever read and I'm so glad that I finally read it!!
B004P8JPS6|5.0|the suspence was great.  The whole story kept you wondering how this could happen.. The Affair was one book I couldn't put down.

B007L3BMGA|1.0|Didn't know anything about this book, except a friend mentioned it as being &#34;top&#34; read. Quite a shock to realise it was pornographic, since my friend and I are from a generation that didn't have access to porn. However we did have access to Feminism - and therefore I find the book abhorrent. Both Christian and Ana are reduced to their desires, and their traditional gender roles. Christian is wealthy and in business and wants for nothing except a submissive; Ana is poor(ish) and an humanities graduate with only an internship to look forward to. He bribes her with expensive gifts, she bites her lip (read &#34;bats her eyelashes&#34;). We are expected to accept his dark Grey ways because he is psychologically tormented by being adopted by a fantastically well-adjusted, wealthy professional family, who didn't notice he was a sex slave to someone in his formative years? I can't decide though whether I am more offended by the ridiculous gender stereotypes in the book, or the naked display of gross capitalist, consumerism. I am well-aware that the majority of the population aspire to extreme wealth as shown on television. I had hoped that books would be a refuge away from the mindless drive to acquire what we don't need and reduce human relationships to the marketplace. That is the true pornography here.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I loved this book. When I first started reading it, I thought  it was going to be like every other story of someone marrying a stranger while in Vegas, but it definitely has many twists and turns that kept me guessing. I highly recommend this book if you are looking for a romance novel.
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|These Advent Calendars are cool!<br />Great small collection of Star wars legos.<br />And for only $1.66 per day you can keep your kid from asking &#34;is it Christmas yet?&#34; everyday, ten times a day.
B00846REIS|4.0|Great book but the ending was a little disappointing. Hot sex scenes... reminded me a lot of 50 Shades of Gray
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I think this was a great book and can't wait til the movie. It only took me a week to read it.<br />I am actually in the process of reading it again.
B003WUYRGI|3.0|I barely got any of it but it is kind of cool Utah. Sarah is awesome. Coll and the world is kind to a friend of cool Utah jazz hands

159420411X|5.0|There are so many reviews of this book I won't paste in the long one I've written, but you can find it at everythingequalseverything.blogspot.com, January 2013.  It's a bit of a summary of what I took away.<br /><br />The chapters are poorly named but they cover, in order: 1. mortgage collapse, 2. politics, 3. baseball, 4. weather, 5. earthquakes, 6. GDP, 7. epidemics, 8., Bayesian probability itself, 9. chess, 10. poker, 11. stocks, 12. climate change, and 13. terrorism.<br /><br />Each of these is a different situation, as they vary in the amount of information available (weather, much; terrorism, little), in the thoroughness of the causal model (poker, great; stocks, poor), in the amount of bias (gambling, none; climate change, much).<br /><br />Silver is the one to write this book -- a former gambler in poker and baseball, currently a political forecaster with amazing skills, and broadly interested in anticipating correctly, and aware of the difficulties doing so, and the advantages of getting it right.  Often it's just a matter of getting things better than others get them, so I'm thankful that he's willing to share his knowledge.<br /><br />For more observations, read my blog.  Or just buy the book.  Or both.  And might I recommend Dan Kahneman's Thinking Fast and Slow for one covering a range of mistakes we make in thinking, which I would heartily recommend along with this one.
0671015206|5.0|If every American read this book:<br />He would not be in debt<br />There would be less broken families, as financial problems in the #1 reason for divorce<br />There one be more 1 income families so one parent could stay home and raise their kids, and not leave it to day care, schools and before/ aftercare, to brainwash them<br />He would feel locked into the job he hates<br />He would not accept the reckless spending of his Congressmen and Senators.<br /><br />Read this book, and don't be like the other debt slaves.....
B003K1EYM6|5.0|Camera connection kit functioned as expected, no issues with build, no issues with anything, really.  Easy t hook up whatever you need.
0671646788|5.0|There are many great lessons in this book and lots of relevant information, jam packed into this book.  I have wasted time reading many of the latest and greatest best sellers, that don't come close to this classic.  This is not the Bible, and it is a danger of one treats it as such. Nevertheless, It is full of useful timeless info.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|I had low expectations for this movie, as I thought the whole concept seemed pretty stupid. And then when I watched it I found myself laughing out loud at many of the scenes they were so funny. The humor was witty and most I the movie was fast-paced, though it did start to drag toward the end.
1400067820|3.0|First the problems. 40% of the the book is about the dangers of drawing conclusions from specious data and another 40% devoted to proving his ideas through loose anecdotal stories. This gets old really quick.<br />Mixed into that 80% is the never ending lesson on how smart Mr Taleb is. If you succeed in finishing the book you will have learned he has a very high opinion of himself.<br />I started by sampling the book, just opening to random locations and start reading but i always became frustrated with the ego message combined with arguments that really appear shallow and incomplete.<br />At one point he decides he may need a body guard against attacks for something he did but then decides it would be much better for him to get in shape himself so he lifts weights and becomes strong. Can you just hear Mr Taleb in a different position pointing out the fallacy of building physical strength when the attack would likely be an ambush with a weapon and no muscle mass would suffice.<br /><br />Now there are good ideas sprinkled in there. The antifragility thing ( what academics would note as stochastic optimization ) certainly is correct. Here i will sum it up in a sentence. Random unpredictable deviations forced upon a system can drive it to more optimal states that present theories would have predicted. There you have a good portion of the book.<br />As for his attack on academics, they are surely overrated in many ways as education is elevated to a religion, but it is not as severe as Mr Taleb indicates.<br />It's a good book to keep by your bed and read as much as you can tolerate at one time then leave it until your mood restores.
B005HSL626|5.0|Good game, very fun and addictive.  Easy to play before I know it I have to plug in my knidle, lol.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I normally read fantasy, but needed a break from the genre. Came across this book and decided to give it a shot. Amazing book!<br /><br />Great characterization, great plot, always keeping you on your toes. Good luck putting the book down during the fifth section. Can't wait to start reading the other Wool novels.
0307719774|5.0|I bought for the all adult females on my list.  It's premise is fun, thoughtful and takes only a minute or two to complete. I started my as soon as it arrived in mid-December. And keep it and a pen next to my bed.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great work of fiction. Suspend reality and enjoy. Great and relaxing read. No great wars or tremendous ethical lessons just a good read.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Love the books, and I love what HBO has done with the TV adaptation. Storm of Swords is the best in the Song of Ice and Fire series so far. I can't wait to see how HBO will bring this excellent \\"chapter\\" in the series to the screen. I'm glad that I started reading the books to get the source's perspective, because while Game of Thrones Season 1 kept the storyline about 98% intact with very few liberties, the second season had some more noticeable differences. But the differences so far have not been so terrible that I'd complain even a little bit.<br /><br />I'm delighted to finally be ahead of the TV show now. It's cool to read the book then be able to see the characters literally come to life on the screen. The one descrepany from book to screen that is hard to get used to but done very well by the TV people is the age of many of the prime characters. I guess that in a book it's okay to write about tennagers commiting acts of violence, having sex or worse getting raped, but apparantly HBO thought a lot of that would land them in hot water on the screen. And they would probably be correct.<br /><br />The books are very long reads with a ton of words, side stories and descriptions that could have been left out without affecting the story at all. In fact as I look at some of the reviews for some of the subsequent books to Storm of Swords it's a more common complaint by fans. But I was glued to every bit of this third in the series and I know that I'll be compelled to read on.<br /><br />The first three books in the series seem to only set the stage for the rest of the epic series. Although who knows based on the surprising demise of some characters that you'd have thought would never die. What's clear is that more war lies in the future. I'm hooked on A Song of Ice and Fire, and you will be too if you get through the first three. Don't miss this series if you're into the action/fantasy genre.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Cool story and fun to play. Would like a longer game & tougher clues. The mirrored worlds are great! Cant wait for the next game
1612183956|4.0|Wayward Pines is one freaky place.  The nurse is too nice, the sheriff is too mean, the bartender too generous and the town is too perfect.  It would be easy to get lulled into complacent routines in a town like this, but then you'd miss out on all the fun!  WIthout giving away any spoilers, suffice it to say that you'd better be prepared to RUN a LOT if you don't want to fall in line and pretend like everything is AOK in Wayward Pines.<br /><br />Crouch writes with intensity and a crazed pace.  Our hero is a bit much in the macho department, but he simply needs to be an awesome secret-agent, Iraqi vet-type to live through the night in Wayward Pines.  Anyone other than our hero would either be mindlessing BBQing with the residents of WP, or be completely dead,  by the middle of the book.  Only a real superman could withstand all that WP has to offer.<br /><br />This is one of those books for people who love apocalyptic-type stories.  The reader must be willing to go where Crouch goes with this story and not worry about whether or not it's realistic.  I mean, the story simply could not exist (THANK GOD) if this were a realistic true-to-life plain jain mystery thriller.  Basically, it's got a massive dose of science fiction at it's core, and I think it's awesome.<br /><br />You will not need long to read this book.  I am not a very fast reader, but this book had me firing up the Kindle at all possible times.  Two days later, I was done with the book.  I honestly would have enjoyed a much longer version of this story, but that would have killed the frenetic speed at which the story unfolds.  I will highly recommend this book for anyone looking for a light, fun and thrilling read.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Fantastic! This was a gift for my daughter who is a great fan.  She loves it!  Thank you for putting these all together.
B00AB0AXU6|1.0|This movie is absurdly bad. The plot was silly, the dialog nonsensical. The whole movie was essentially characters going through a video game. The characters are going through a complex to try and escape. As they hit different rooms, they get different monsters to fight through. In between \\"levels\\", the computer pops up, complains that they're still alive, and indicates what new monsters will be released on the next level. The producers clearly need to put down their game controllers and get out more. They either don't care about this movie, or suck really bad.
B0091REZMW|4.0|this game is so addictive and lots of fun. I can't put it down. the only complaint I have is that it's hard to get additional gems other then to actually buy them.
B002LFAHBO|3.0|I love this movie but it took longer than I expected to arrive and the case was broken. It was smashed on both sides even though it was packaged with bubble wrap. The cover also falls out easily.
B007SGM084|5.0|I love this series. It was soo good cant wait to see if they DO make out of the books.
B00ADYY7MA|5.0|Yes, Fade Into You is missing but so is For Your Glory. The actors/singers are fantastic. I have not heard one song from the album or the show that is not great. This is what Country Music should sound like. I am only hoping season two's soundtrack (please) will have all of the songs. Not just what we will hear from that season but also what was missed from season one. For now, I will purchase the singles and make my own CD of the soundtrack for my car. Again, even with what is missing, this is well worth the money.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I can't tell you how many times I have watched this!  Love the series, but didn't always get to see the entire episode.  Funny how you miss small things when watching it on tv!  Highly recommended!

145162607X|5.0|This is book 4 of the Cousins' War series or the War of the Roses.  This is the great historical fiction in which Philippa Gregory excells.  It it the story of Anne and Isabel Neville.  Their father was known as the Kingmaker, after putting Edward IV of York on the thrown.  One of Gregory's best.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|This game is good for passing the time, but some items are hidden behind the stats bars and are impossible to find without using a hint. I guess that's the flaw of the screen size on the kindle.
1582701709|4.0|There's an old joke that my dad used to tell and this book somewhat reminds me of it.<br /><br />There was an extremely religious older lady who was trapped on the roof of her house during a flood.  A couple of men in a life raft drifted to her house, \\"Ma'am?  We have come to take you to higher ground!\\"<br /><br />The lady responded, \\"No!  God will save me!\\"<br /><br />As the hours passed and the waters rose, a helicopter flew to her home and began to hover over the roof with the older lady still standing there.  A voice yelled out, \\"I am coming down to get you to take to you to saftey!\\"<br /><br />\\"No thank you,\\" the woman yelled, \\"God will save me!\\"<br /><br />The helicopter flew away without her.<br /><br />More time went by, the waters rose over her home and she wound up drowning.  When she was in heaven, she asked God, \\"I had such faith, why didn't you save me?\\"<br /><br />He said, \\"I tried, I sent a raft and a helicopter!\\"<br /><br />If you wish, read this book, use it the best you can to better your life, in whatever way suits you.  Realize that when the path leads you somewhere, that you will need to take action.  You will need to do something.  The folks that made money did something to make that money (they took the raft).  They made a promise to themselves and they kept that promise.  How long did it take, the whole process to write \\"Chicken Soup for the Soul\\" and get it published...from the idea to seeing it on the bookstore shelf?  Some people have the drive to do this when they are pushed and believe this.  Some people will believe it but just don't have the drive.<br /><br />I am going through a difficult time and received this book as a gift for my birthday.  It has helped me realize that dwelling on the negative doesn't do any good.  All it does is make me feel bad, and dwell on the past, while my kids are living in the present in the same room!  Reading this has made me become more aware of my negative thoughts, which allows me to refocus on bettermore important things that are going on in the present.  It has given me positive thoughts for the future.  It has bolstered my feelings in faith.  It has made me reflect on what makes me a magnificent person..a portion of my identity that I lost over the years<br /><br />Everyone's mind is different.  Those who need proof, years of study and experts with loads of accolades may not like this book at all.<br /><br />If you take notice, there are hundreds of self-help books.  Some of these books are written by Ph.d's, some are written by people who went through a devasting time in their life and are writing their experiences to maybe help someone else have a break-through in their crisis.<br /><br />People, unless it's a math book or a book on chemistry, take out of it what works for you, and use it to better your life. If all you get out of it is thinking more positively, or genuinely being grateful for the people and things you have in your life right now it is worth it.  If your positiveness rubs off on someone else..then that's icing on the cake.  Live and Love Well!
B007Q0OV6Q|4.0|Nothing really special about this one.  Lots of flyers, and a couple of head-scratchers - not really sure what they are or how they fit into Star Wars.  But that's okay, because it's Lego - and Lego is always a good thing in our house!
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|The movie was really good from the eye of an avid Family Guy watcher. The humour did get quite nasty at times and watching it with an in-law I could tell that she was going to need to head back to church.
B004GJIL34|1.0|From the great reviews I was expecting this to be an amazing film.<br />There's a 20 minute conversation between 2 men in the middle of the movie.<br />way too long and immediately following that conversation they show a man<br />cleaning for 5 mins really boring. The Hunger Strikes comes all the way<br />at the end of the movie and it's very short and the only good part of the<br />movie. I will not recommend this movie to anyone.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|What can I say it is a 5 star series. It was an owesome story the actors are great,screen play great. That is why it got so many awards
B004LWZWGK|5.0|It starts alittle slow the first half but is intense the second half. Its almost 2.5 hours though so make sure uve got plenty of time to watch it
B000P0J024|3.0|missing the booklet.  other than that it's a good product to own since roy orbinson is part of the group.  since the bear family record box set is financially out of reach at this time, i'm settling for his other releases.

Now I love this app. So people who doubt their like it try it out.I made a little bit of a fool out of my self.And if you don't like it here's what you do:keep your mouth shut &amp; either delete the game(&amp; if you don't know how ask for help instead of throwing a fit.)or live with it.

B0073LWEXK|5.0|just finished this game, loved it.  the graphics are decent.<br />this is a puzzle game which you need to find objects to open hidden doors, etc ,not too hard not too easy.<br />there is also a hint guide which is helpful when you get stuck<br />played on kindle 1st gen
B009KHDT0C|4.0|I would give Dark Shadows the movie 5 Stars, but this disk only 4.<br /><br />Tim Burton's more modern take on the basic story from the soap opera (which has changed very little) is quite satisfying. Johnny Depp's Barnabas Collins is hilarious, but still a very sympathetic character. His need to kill seems a sad, little foible. I found myself dismayed and amused by my lack of sympathy for his victims. Sorry, Tim, but I found the only disappointing casting decision (or character concept) to be your usually note perfect spouse, Helena Bonham Carter as Dr. Hoffman, She was frequently humorous, but totally unconvincing.<br /><br />Eve Green was spot on as the evil Angelique, who was always my fav in the original show. She's more beautiful as a brunette, but just as talented as a blonde.<br /><br />I just wish there were a commentary with Tim & Johnny. Since I'm not getting it, I'll throw in Danny Elfman, who did his usual marvelous job on the score.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Great movie not what I expected but still pretty good enjoyed watching it and I hope they make more soon
B005ZUR724|4.0|pretty good game wish there was a &quot;tab&quot; target type of thing though. gets a little hard to target on the 8.9

B00785P2QC|4.0|Time gets away from me when I'm playing this game... Just 5 more minutes...and an hour goes by! :D You've been warned, now start playing Virtual City Playground to create YOUR city.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I couldn't put the book down! Beautifully written, and certainly held my interest. It's a sad one, but has a rich truthfulness about it. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading!
B0085P2Z6E|3.0|not bad but it has a few miss labelled items, and its pretty much the same old thing. nothing is really new. excellent buy for a buck.
B009186JYI|2.0|The overly effusive reviews notwithstanding, this thing is a bloody mess.  The reason it was never released widely when originally made is painfully apparent.<br /><br />The Stones are great on stage but the filming of the group playing live is terrible.  The camera angles are mostly from stage left or from behind the group.  Worse yet, it was filmed with an often out-of-focus and jittery hand-held camera!  The band is never seen in full from the audience's point-of-view (as they WERE seen in the T.A.M.I Show).  We are only shown brief snippets of individual group member's faces up close and at odd angles (usually from stage left or from behind).  The shots of Charlie Watts dully pounding out the same beat from song to song never seem to vary at all!  Keith Richads, way over there at stage right, is barely seen.  Also, the cameras never focus on Brian's guitar work.....you just see bare glimpses of him playing and smiling.<br /><br />The footage of the band offstage is dull and off-putting.  It's no wonder that this band was always ranked a distant 2nd to the Beatles.  Their stature rose to the titanic proportions they enjoy today only after the Beatles disbanded.<br /><br />A Hard Day's Night this ain't.....it's more like just a Hard Night.  Even die-hard Stones fans Can't Get No Satisfaction from this crude, inartfully constucted film.
B0050N8N0Q|1.0|Foster the People are nothing more than weak vocal, Pop music. There is no way this band should be classified as Alternative Rock.
B009NPKTN6|4.0|I loved the movie.  The performances were great. Tom Cruise was so believable as this drugged out rocker and surprisingly, he's got the cords to pull off the acting and vocal performance.  The songs that were chosen summed up the 80's, it made ya feel good so thanks for the memories.
B009IQ0TGM|4.0|Close with the more downtempo songs, but her uptempo songs are really great. Sometimes repetitive words and production of songs but I think that's what she was going for.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|This movie lagged in places.  I thought the men out performed the women every time.  My favorite part of the movie was when all the groups gathered around and tried to out sing and out style vocally everyone.  I wish the whole movie was based on that.  The competition should have been on the street, not on the stage.  It would have been a much better movie.
B00A7ZWUJC|3.0|Kind of expecting more since Talk that Talk was good, she went a different path and there's nothing wrong with experimenting. Album seemed kind of short, and not really stand out tracks to be singles but it's still a good album.
B009VB97EY|2.0|The dancing was fantastic, but the story line stunk.  This story line wasn't one that was believable.  If you want more than beautiful bods, then don't buy this movie.  You will be disappointed.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|I liked this movie it has a lot of the action Heros from the 80s the only thing I did not like was that jit lee was cut out of the picture.

B006WQLH7G|5.0|It actually scans all your apps and features on your Kindle, very much like it would do with a PC. No complaints.
0307592731|5.0|While I did not always emphathize with Cheryl Strayed's moral character during this time of her life (the promiscuity during marriage and after the drug use) her book was fascinating and held my interest the entire time.  Was also nice to read about areas of which I was also familiar.  After Wild I went on to read Torch which was easier to get into because of the background on Wild, but sure was a raw downer of a story.

B0063IH60K|5.0|Great for all ages.  Great stress reliever!!!  Grandkids love learning this game, so good for all ages and levels of learners!
0807014273|4.0|Book arrived promptly. Does not look like it was ever read. Good price for the book. I have an early copy I did not want to part with. Price was 60 cents so I bought this one to give to a friend. Told it was used they were very happy.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|After literally hundreds of books, this one has prompted my first ever review, out of sheer excitement and desire to say Thank You to Mr. Ferriss.<br /><br />I finished the first read last night and ate eggs within 30 minutes of waking this morning, another first for one who detests food and conversation within 2 hours of waking. I am writing grocery lists that include tea, another first for one who subsists almost entirely on coffee. I made wish lists of kitchen tools while learning to tie knots and plotting where to build a debris shelter in spring.<br /><br />The tone of every chapter in this book is friendly, chatty, unpretentious and can-do. Inspiring, eye opening, and cluttered with fun activities for anyone with a hunger for learning a bit of everything, it makes me feel ready to take on all sorts of challenges.<br /><br />Please do have another one ready when I've worked my way through this one :)
B007FH9GA6|5.0|This movie was very intriguing and entertaining. Lots of twists and turn. Some romance mixed in as well. Good mystery that keeps you guessing.

For everyone who has ever worked in a cube, a company or in the middle of corporate politics we all swear Dilbert is parked around the corner spying on the daily activites of our office in time to provide us a relavent cartoon by the time we come in tomorrow. A great little calendar to provide humor even on your most frustrating days.

B00APUQT7I|4.0|this movie is really cute and funny , my kids and i really liked it  it is a  little different than the other ice age since it deals with parenting issues
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book. I read it in one day i couldn't take my eyes off of it! Can't wait to read the next one
B008B8DY2O|5.0|This book was given to me, and really I will pass on by buying it for others. While not life-changing for me, the book gives a very down to earth view of life in India. I burst out in laughter at times and felt real sorrow for this true story. Must-read!
B001IF252C|2.0|I needed an adapter to connect a new 2012 Mac Mini to an old Apple 30\\" Cinema Display and tried both the Apple DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI adapter and the Accel B087B-007B (note that the Amazon page list several models - this is a \\"3D Support\\" version which has higher bandwidth).<br /><br />In my testing, setting the desktop to solid black seemed to reveal issues the quickest.  Here were my findings.<br /><br />Apple DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI Adapter:<br /><br />The first unit I tried was pretty bad.  Lots of blue noise over the black desktop, plus \\"sparklies\\", which I simply could not tolerate.  I got a replacement which was better, but would still show some of the same artifacts occasionally - the problems would come and go.  I was able to get a good quality picture when I used the adapter with a high-quality DVI-repeater - however the repeater cost more than the adapter which made the solution too expensive and a bit cumbersome.<br /><br />Given that the Apple adapter worked fine with a DVI repeater, I suspect the adapter just isn't robust enough.  Perhaps if the cable wasn't so long or higher quality it would have been OK.<br /><br />Accell UltraAV B087B-007B:<br /><br />The Accell adapter has been nearly perfect for me.  None of the \\"sparklies\\" and video noise I experienced with the Apple adapter.  I have only seen picture issues once which appeared a bit like stuck pixels.  I can't be certain that it was due to the adapter - I had been using the computer all day and perhaps something had gotten a bit too warm.  I'll wait and see what happens when the weather gets warmer.<br /><br />I did also try another Accell DisplayPort version (B087B-002B) with an additional adapter which definitely worked better than the Apple model, though I *think* there were still some sparklies occasionally, though it was too infrequent and subtle to be sure.  But I don't have the same suspicion with the B087B-007B.<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />In short, the Apple adapter went back to the store and I'm keeping the Accell.  The primary con I see with the Accell B087B-007B is the loss of a USB port (it doesn't replicate a USB port like the Apple version), but I can live with that.  I prefer the shorter cable on the Accell model as well, but wish it didn't require the (included) Mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort adapter.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book as good as it gets, it has a lot of depth. I love all the twist and turns. I was in love with the slammed series, but now I'm just I love with Colleen Hoover, she truly has a gift and I can't wait for her next book!
1400067820|4.0|As other reviewers have pointed out, Mr. Taleb is quite smart.  And furthermore Mr. Taleb is quite taken by how smart he is.  This makes it more difficult to enjoy what otherwise would be a quite brilliant book.<br /><br />The most frustrating part of this is the author's arrogant lack of self-awareness.  For example, he discusses the \\"anti-fragile\\" merits of federalism and small businesses, and their responsiveness to local conditions, without one word about the fact that Milton Friedman and other classical liberal economists have been making this argument for decades.  He ignores the entire line of economic thinking dedicated to this, and instead scatters numerous pointless insults at economists throughout the book, only making a few passing favorable references to Hayek and Adam Smith.  This fault is only more ironic given that he dedicates an entire section of his book to criticizing intellectuals for appropriating other people's ideas and claiming it as their own, all without any sense of irony.<br /><br />But on the whole, in another irony, it is quite good.  Taleb is a captivating writer, even in a maddening way, and his basic point is entirely correct, that we need to take advantage of anti-fragile structures and quite building fragile institutions and practices.  Taleb was right about the recent financial blow-up, he just needs to put down the ego and give some productive ideas, rather than spending so much pointless time mocking his enemies for not being as smart as he is.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|I ,love this new CD from Kelly Clarkson. I am a huge fan & this is a great sampling of all her CD's.
B000004756|5.0|Music like this comes once every 50 years. The combined genius of these three brilliant guitar players is hard to find in any genre, let alone the guitar. I saw them in 1996 at Symphony Hall in Boston in the worst seats imaginable. I had to crane my neck 90 degrees to see the stage and lean forward. Nonetheless, two hours of that and my jaw hanging open just hearing the incredible sounds emanating from their guitars in that stunning acoustic setting was one of the greatest sonic experiences of my life.<br /><br />This is music for all times. From the artsy and gutsy compositions of DiMeola to the world-tinged McLaughlin fusion jazz ripped pieces to the mellow magnificence of 'Manha de Carnival' performed with such unimaginable grace and delicacy, this record speaks to the soul and showcases the genius of all three guitar players who blend together into a seamless melodic ether, floating above everything else.<br /><br />As  a 'desert island' CD, this is a must have for anyone who loves guitar.<br /><br />Please buy this CD. Please!!!!!!
B004L79VUI|5.0|My husband is a big fan, I have never listened before, but this was very good. he has a wonderful voice & his songs are amazing.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|Since I watch they show I ordered the book to read and see how it is. Turns out it is very entertaining to read. After watching the show you picture the characters as you see them on TV. As the plot thickens you find it harder to put the book down. Since reading this one I have also read the next couple in the series and they all are worth reading.
B00000J2PH|5.0|How can you not like this CD. It is Carole King at her best. I had the tape & could hardly wait to get the CD.
B009JBZH54|5.0|this gift was for my 18 yr old nephew and he loved it. He is a real movie buff and asked for this specific movie set.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What a breath of fresh air! This book was lovely in so many ways. Hoover makes us love the characters on such a personal level. I hated to see the story end.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Ive read all of his Books, and all his books up to the black box has kept my interest from page one to the last page and i hope he doesn't stp writing to soon.<br /><br />Thank You For All The Entertainment You Gave Me/SanB
B00319ECGU|4.0|The dirty harry series show Eastwood at his best, they are great you wont be disappointed. If you like tough no nonsense guys that can care less about political correctness then Clint Eastwood is your man.
034580404X|5.0|Love the first book and looking forward to reading the rest of the series. I also bought a set as a gift.
B005LAII9O|3.0|Sad to say that this is not the typical review of the plot, acting, whether or not Stone has lost his edge or any of that; just a review of the quality of the disc.  That said, I did not buy it but rented it on Blu Ray from Red Box.  Was very surprised that tho it was on the DVD's menu, because it was a rental, the ability to view the extended cut was blocked somehow, so I was forced to watch only the theatrical release.  Therefore, this review will focus only on the quality of the Blu Ray regarding that release.<br /><br />Video...Warm coloration with little to no visible or disturbing grain.  I saw no artifacting at all and while there were many scenes that would have brought out aliasing if the transfer had them, I saw none of that either.  There was good details in the darker scenes and shadows.  Ultimately, if you liked the film than you will have no problems with the video transfer at all.<br /><br />Audio...DTS MA 5.1....The soundtrack is ever present and enveloping out of all channels.  Often the soundtrack is largely spread across the front stage but for Savages, your entire system comes into play.  Good work for the LFE channel as well.  That said, there is little use of your surround system being used for discreet channeling of fx.  Even panning from the many vehicles across or past the viewer is very limited.  I don't know if there is a difference (other than the extended version  being blocked from view) between rental Blu Rays and store bought Blu Rays, but if appears to me that little effort went into the audio editing when it comes to utilizing your complete audio surround system.  This film could have had plenty of it and did not.  Despite this, the audio leveling seemed appropriate and I did not have any difficulty hearing dialogue over the soundtrack.  Set my volume levels once and didn't need to go back to it.<br /><br />Certainly, this is not a Blu Ray film you would want to use as a DEMO disc to show off your system with, however, the video transfer is just fine and the audio is nicely uncompressed, just no discreet work for the foleys.<br /><br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanksnsfer is just fine and the audio is nicely uncompressed, just no discreet work for the foleys.<br /><br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanks
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I have  read both books in this trilogy about war and I can't wait for the third one.  We'll written, engaging stories that have taught me more about history than any class I''ve ever taken. Mr..Follett is a masterful storyteller.  The best part is the  use of four families from four different countries each with their view of events. This is a great book for history buffs an  non-buffs alike.
B005HSG3TC|3.0|doesn't seem very durable.  Very thin and light weight though.  Time will tell.  I have another thicker, heavier case I enjoy more.
B00A9C3RB8|1.0|Boring and predictable - I could have slept  after the first five minutes.. The script was too predictable and simple.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I love the format, but don't like how at the finish of a game ads pop up, requiring ads to be shut down and start over..
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Watched this for date night with my brother in law & his wife, and we all loved it!<br />Buying the soundtrack today :)
B009WO7NQO|5.0|angry bird star wars<br /><br />FUN  FUN  FUN  keeps you guessing we love it because it's challenging. levels are awesome and demanding
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Just found out that my history buff friend didn't have a copy of this series.  I was glad that I could be the one to send it to him.  This is a stand alone great series whether or not you love historical works.
B009VB7QQA|1.0|Couldn't watch the entire movie. First movie I rented for my Kindle Fire, and the 30 day rental period was ok but the 24 hour limit to watch it once you started the movie is not!  Flying over the holidays and different things caused me to start and stop the movie.  Won't rent another movie from Amazon till they change their policy.  Other movies have 48 hours or other viewing limits, but allow unlimited viewing over the 30 day rental like other companies allow.  There are other sources with better terms.  Shame on you Amazon.  This is my first truly bad experience with you.
B008XNZMOU|3.0|I can't truly rate this because CD was a Christmas gift for someone.  I suppose its good, since it is what they wanted.  It did arrive quickly and I liked never leaving house to buy a gift!
0811879542|5.0|I have been happily shopping at Amazon for over 10 years and depend on the customer reviews. However, I have never written a review myself--until this one. This book is so good that I have to break out of my comfort zone and write a review. Anyone who knows how much this book rocks needs to spread the word! It would be a crime not to.<br /><br />I wasn't sure what to expect with this book, but it turned out to be pure magic. Herve Tullet manages a genius maneuver within these pages. He transforms a plain, old, paper book into an interactive one.<br /><br />I gave this book to my nephew for Christmas last year. He was four at the time, and he thought it was magic. He--sadly--is not a huge lover of books, but he was mesmerized with Press Here. He had me read it to him over and over and over. Each time, it was captivating for him. It's worth buying the book just to see the beautiful, surprised, delighted expression on the child's face as they turn each page and see how the book has magically changed.<br /><br />My nephew went on to share the book with the rest of his entire family. He wanted to share the \\"magic\\" with others. Several months later, my sister told me that my nephew did something he has never done before: he brought a book to preschool with him. Of course, it was Press Here. He was proud to show off the book and reveal its magic to his friends. To this day, it is the only book he has ever brought with him to preschool.<br /><br />Though I'd never heard of him before, I now have such respect for Herve Tullet. His book reminded me of the power of simple imagination. We don't always need to wow our kids with sophisticated, high-tech devices. A piece of paper and an open mind are all we really need.<br /><br />I wish Herve Tullet would come out with a sequel to this book. If anyone finds out about a sequel (or another author whose book follows the same concept), please post it as a comment on my review. Thank you!
B001NKI60W|5.0|First time seeing it and it was very fun to watch. Love all the people in the movie!! Would watch again!!!
B008FRFN7A|5.0|I have been searching for a free app for my printer to print from phone and this app is amazing!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Collins explores the theme of a violence-craving society expertly, and the characters that have to go through various trials react realistically. The effects of a ruthless authoritarian government are crystal clear. This has made the novel an instant classic that will surely be taught in high school English a half century from now.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Enjoyed this very much... good tense, drama!<br />Wanted to see it before I went to the sequel at theater and was not disappointed.
B007RXRSEY|5.0|Well I never liked Guns and Roses, but Slash has really done it with Myles Kennedy. This guy has a voice that reaches four octives, holly crap. I can't stop listening to it, along with the awesome guitar riffs of Slash. Keep it comeing guys. Love it.! I first saw Myles on the audience channel. Didn't really want to watch Slash, but when Myles started singing, I fell for it right away. Just goes to show you what a damn good singer can do for a guitar player and band.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|Chase scene after chase scene. Brainless action and despite a couple of clever references to the original, basically no sense of humor. No Mars. Yawn.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Compatible with my kindle fire. Easy to use, and<br /> inexpensive. Definitely worth buying. I will most certainly refer all kindle users to this app
B001JRB16U|5.0|Always a classic and fun anytime! Great for the whole family! Julie Andrews and Dick van Dyke are super, as usual.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I've read all mr. flynn's books, and he is one of my favorite authors.  the mitch rapp character is very  enjoyable
0525478817|5.0|This is truly one classic novel.  I was moved, enlightened and entranced by this beautiful story about life, living, dying and wishing. I laughed, I cried and I allowed myself to face the grief that I had hidden away for so long.  This book was my cure for the cancer of grief that I have carried in my heart for years.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|very good clancey with &#34;all American&#34; jack ryan jr.  very realistic, clancy seems to have his eye on the &#34;real deal&#34;
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really liked this book because of all of the action. Suzanne Collins is a great author. I'll recommend this book to friends.
B0061S073A|5.0|Great download.  I gave my grandkids Kindle Fires for Christmas and their parents the codee and it is working great.  No expensive downloads showing up on my Amazon bill.  Lots of free ones, however.  I recommend this product.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I'm very happy with the game. My four y/o and myself have completed level 38, so far. Pro: We can play, without purchasing in app gems. I love that. Interface is clean simple and play is intuitive. Characters are well animated with awesome voice overs. Fans of the show will adore this game.  Cons: Free play requires significant time commitment. My husband seeing how much we enjoyed the game did purchase a &lt;$5 bag of gems but they were never credited and customer service has been difficult to contact via the app.
159668139X|5.0|Just learning to weave, and I intend to use this book during the process.  Great photos and instructions for newbies.
B0031Q0XCA|5.0|All the actors played their characters quite well.  It was a well thought out and perfectly written movie that you can sit down with friends to watch or even family as long as they're old enough to understand heartbreak!
B005IQZB14|5.0|I thought this would be a good read but it was beyond fantastic. I literally could not put it down. You can feel every emotion that the author feels and go on the journey with her. READ this.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|Great writing for this series and the actors are all played perfectly.  (Although I'm not too sure about Tripplehorn)  I'll give it another few episodes before I make any decision about her character.
B009HXG9UQ|3.0|Quirky film, not really compelling....but some cute and funny moments. Not really my sort of movie-I prefer action or drama.
B002ZG98Z0|1.0|I had to return this DVD because halfway through it stopped working and froze my DVD player. I have yet to see the end of this movie...
B004WR125O|2.0|10 meters from the source, one standard wall - only 30% signal. Haven't expected such poor performance. The ONKYO client serves is no more good. After uploading this review, I've read other opinions (I know it's a bit late to do it afterwards) and the thing is that it looks like at ONKYO they know that the device makes troubles, but it seems to be not bothering them... Shame! At the client support they started to tell me that I should adjust my router for the product to work well, BUT I haven't heard a thing about how it picks up the signal... My last question to them has been left without answer at all. Anyway, this product is advertised as plug&play, and clients are not supposed to care about router setup.
B002SEW5WW|5.0|FUN!  I am anxiously waiting for the new CD from this band.  I am of the older generation so I have to &#34;discover&#34; new music.  I am glad I &#34;discovered&#34; One Republic.
0739422995|2.0|I would have preferred a soft back with Large Print.  I tear out the pages to read.  As the hard back book is too heavy.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I'll admit, I'm late to the game for getting this wonderful game, but boy am I hooked! What a mindless way to spend hours at a time. Now what will I do when I have to go back to work?
B003O86FMW|5.0|Excellent story line. Realistic people who have kept my imagination going. Made you feel like you are part of the story
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Wow<br />The book was written so well.  I did not expect that ending.  It was difficult to put down this book.  I loved it.
B002NZTZ8S|3.0|Overall, the movie has a good story and moral, but the graphics are a bit lacking in my opinion. It also seems a bit slow and dragging and my three and five year old had trouble paying attention.<br /><br />By the end of the movie, only the adults were actually still watching.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I am not usually into RPGs but this one is great! I love dragons and with this game you get to raise some. You get to interact with others who have dragons. It is alot of fun and addictive too.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|I honestly cannot think of one bad thing about this movie.... except maybe my three year old asking for a frying pan!<br />The story line is fantastic and heartwarming, the animation is beautiful, and I love that my kids were engaged the entire time.<br /><br />We rented this at first so as not to waste money if the kids didn't like it. But after our first family viewing, I know we will definitely be purchasing the DVD/Blu Ray combo!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I really like the history. You can go back and see the actual numbers you entered.  The numbers are very large and easy to read.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is wonderful!  It provides an app by app<br /><br />(primary apps only) breakdown for the remaining amounts.<br /><br />A must for heavy users!
B00457WZEI|5.0|is this book real i really want to know but this book is so sad it made me want to really cry so bad i have to stop cry or i will cry until the mornings and nights.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|I had to have this just to see how it was. Glad I got it, I play this often. I am getting pretty good at this one.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Over all this game delivered just what I'd wanted from a HO game. Bigfish surely disappoint with graphics and storyline, but I have to be honest and say that the controls left something to be desired. Things were kind of choppy and I ended up mis-touching half the time.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This game is cool, I played it a few time's but like my sport & driving game's a bit more.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I liked the book but thought he was going to talk more about heaven and the other side instead of his illness.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|I have fun playing this game, it's a change from the game's I have and I do play this often.
B0006J28L4|5.0|really enjoyed movie. would recommend it to any and everyone ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
B00A757EFW|5.0|I purchased this game on my son's system for me! I love Pacman and play it every chance I get. We were scrolling through looking for game's my son wanted to purchase and when I say this he knew it was being installed for ME! As much fun as I remember and I try to play it everytime my son isn't using his Kindle. Love, Love, Love Pacman!
B00001NTXN|5.0|This is a great way to learn strategies and to learn how to manipulate somebody else's mind. I would recommend this to people ages 10+.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I use You Tube quite often so to have access to this on my tablet is great. Don't have to get on another system to get on.
0756666937|5.0|My three grandsons enjoy the book.....they are from age six to fourteen. The boys read it when they go to bed
B0086700CM|4.0|Cool game, had fun with it. I was wondering what it was and it's fun to play every once in a while.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|It is good and entertaining and awesome it feels like u are in it and watching it when u read the book
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I had to play this when I saw it. It's all the rage so I hear. I see why, this game is fun and I do enjoy playing it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a very easy game and it is very entertaining. It will help you consume your time if you have nothing to do and you are very bored.
0062060562|5.0|Before I Go To Sleep is the first novel by British author S.J.Watson. Christine Lucas has the sort of amnesia that prevents her from storing new memories. This means that she wakes each day in an unfamiliar bedroom, next to a man she doesn't know. The face she sees in the mirror is that of a woman much older than she knows herself to be. Each morning the man in her bed reassures her that he is Ben, her husband of 22 years, and that he loves her and will take care of her. So everything will be OK, won't it? Watson has created a novel with an original plot and some delicious twists, a novel full of suspense with a heart-stopping climax and a perfect ending. Watson skilfully conveys Christine's confusion, her doubts about her own memories, her fear of paranoia and ultimately her mistrust of what she is told. This debut novel is a brilliantly conceived psychological thriller that is hard to put down and will keep the reader guessing to the end. S.J.Watson is an author to watch.
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|Virtually every character that matters dies.  That's a hard story to pull off.  The number of well known tragedies is rightly short.  This movie won't be joining that list.<br /><br />The basic premise of a pack of wolves hunting down a group of humans is unconvincing.  The majority of the human characters seem like caricatures.  The choices they make trying to get themselves rescued are laughably stupid.  And the bit with the wallets literally made me slap my forehead.  Just plain stupid.
B002GJU54E|3.0|Plum Spooky is the fourth novel in the Stephanie Plum Between the Numbers books by Janet Evanovich. Stephanie's main FTA in this instalment is the diminutive Martin Munch, a quantum physics whiz, who has, inconveniently, been targeted by the Unmentionable Gerwulf Grimoire (Wulf) to help with a scheme to control the world's weather. Enter Diesel, coincidentally cousin to the evil Wulf, and cosmic bounty hunter. Apart from a good deal of murder, kidnapping, and thievery, there are mythical entities (Easter Bunny, Jersey Devil, Sasquatch, Fire Farter), the use of a nail gun on the human body and the destruction of at least one of Stephanie's vehicles. Stephanie babysits a monkey (or seven), is kidnapped for use as a sex slave, gets lost in the Pine Barrens without bars on her cell phone, gets into a fruit fight, steals a van and some rockets, rides in a helicopter, blows up a fuel depot and a mine and gets stuck in a cranberry bog. Readers don't come to Plum for depth: \\"What do you think about death?\\" I asked Diesel. \\"I like the buffet. After that it's not my favourite thing\\". Lula is still engaged to Tank but consulting with Miss Gloria and things are looking shaky. Best exchange is probably: \\"How's it going?\\" Morelli wanted to know. \\"It's average. Stole a truck. Blew up a house. Brought home seven monkeys. And now there's a naked man in my shower.\\" \\"Yeah, same ol', same ol'.\\" Morelli said. Evanovich should lose Carl the very irritating monkey before proceeding. Some laugh-out-loud moments, but this one is average.
B001FAZYOQ|5.0|I was at this show, both nights at the Santa Monica Civic, and it was epic. I've had the bootleg vinyl for years and was surprised and delighted to see it finally available on CD. Truly one of the best live albums I've heard. Complete with mistakes, stage banter, etc. You feel like you're at the concert. Classic early Bowie set list. This was Bowie's first US tour and first shows in LA, so it's history, baby. A must have for Bowie fans.
0547848412|5.0|Life of Pi is the second novel by Canadian author Yann Martel. It tells the story the 227-day ordeal, in a lifeboat with a 450 pound Royal Bengal tiger, of a sixteen-year-old Indian youth, Piscine Molitor Patel (Pi). It is told in three parts: Pi's youth in Pondicherry at his father's zoo and the Patel family's decision to emigrate to Canada; the sinking of the ship and Pi's sojourn on the lifeboat; and Pi's interview by officials from the Japanese Ministry of Transport, in an Infirmary in Mexico; the author's notes about his meetings with Pi, the Japanese official who interviewed Pi and the family friend of the Patel's who first alerted him to the story, lend an authenticity to the novel. Martel's story touches on theology, zoology, human behaviour, sanity and the will to survive, and his meticulous research into his subjects is apparent in every chapter. With lyrical prose, Martel describes Pi's encounters with fish, turtles, birds and whales, as well as the quality of the sky, the sea and the wind. Pi's experience with the floating algae island proves that anything that seems too good to be true, usually is. My favourite scene was the encounter on the seaside esplanade of Pi's parents, the pundit, the imam and the priest, especially the effect of Pi's last words on the holy men. The objections that the incredulous Japanese officials cite to Pi's fantastic story are quite amusing; the alternate version that Pi offers them, on the other hand, is certainly sobering. Martel's imagery is evocative: \\"I believe it was this that saved my life that morning, that I was quite literally dying of thirst. Now that the word had popped into my head I couldn't think of anything else, as if the word itself were salty and the more I thought of it, the worse the effect.\\" And he occasionally has Pi very succinctly describing his predicament: \\"...to be a castaway is to be caught up in grim and exhausting opposites....\\" , \\"Life on a lifeboat isn't much of a life.\\" There is horror in this story, but also much humanity and humour is laced throughout. Highly original, funny and thought-provoking.

B003JTHXOK|4.0|This has been a treasure to read and kept me smiling through the whole book. Defiantly recommend for the romantic at heart.
B005DJGMQE|4.0|Though I knew going into this movie that John Wilkes Booth shot Abraham Lincoln and died on the run in a barn, I knew very little about those implicated in the plot. This movie follows Frederick Aiken, the man charged with defending \\"the conspirator\\" Mary Surratt. This movie includes some well known actors and familiar faces. While not for everyone, it is definitely one who likes historical pieces. It certainly sheds light on the politics of Washington at the end of the Civil War. It also depicts the attitude of Southern sympathizers who happened to live in the North. One of the central themes of this movie is that of justice and receiving a fair trial. It is not hard to see the parallel the writer/director was trying to make with current events.
B009O2XY12|5.0|I know the people that gave this game a bad review by saying they had to pay money to continue will never see this, but I hope this review may change the minds of others that are considering the purchase of this game.  You do NOT have to pay money to continue on to different levels of play.  You have so many energies that you play with.  When the energy is used up, you just have to put the game away for a while and energy builds back up.  True, you CAN purchase energy, but you don't HAVE to.  Patience is all it takes.  This is a very fun game, and gives you a chance to exercise your brain.  It isn't just luck, but you have to think about what you are doing.  I was turned on to this game by my daughter and granddaughter.  I love it!  I recently purchased a Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\" tablet.  I gave my husband my original Kindle Fire and he downloaded the game to play.  He is hooked as well.  Give it a chance.  It costs you nothing, and if you don't like it you can uninstall it.  I guarantee you will be hooked as well, and become a Bubble Mania Maniac, too!

0060936223|4.0|A very good friend, visiting from New Jersey, bought me this book at RiverRun, a local independent bookstore, in late July 2012. I immediately put it on my Christmas reading list. Patti Smith and Robert Mapplethorpe could pass for my older brother and sister, age-wise. But we grew up in such radically different circumstances, I knew of neither of them until the NEA blow-up over his photographs, cancelled at the Corcoran, mounted and challenged in court in Cincinnati. So, I'm not bringing any New York savvy, or '70s/'80s art-and-drug scene hipness to my appreciation for this book. I think I'm just bringing gratitude. Twenty-two years after Mapplethorpe's death in 1988, the book comes out and takes me by complete surprise. The poet, Patti Smith (not the other poet, Patricia Smith) knew Mapplethorpe? Lived with him? Struck her flint to his steel and vice-versa during their formative years? What's not to find intriguing about that?<br /><br />I am also grateful that Smith, at a couple of places, verbalizes what I have sensed about the work of Mapplethorpe: the misterium tremendum, the mystery that attracts and the terror that simultaneously repels. \\"...on the whole he was in a position similar to that of the young Jean Genet showing his works to Cocteau and Gide. They knew he was great, but they feared the intensity of his gift, and also what his subject matter might reveal about themselves. ... As Cocteau said of a Genet poem, \\"His obscenity is never obscene.\\" [HarperCollins paperback reprint, p. . 199] And \\"His bold, elegant show mixed classic motifs with sex, flowers, and portraits, all equivalent in their presentation: unapologetic images of cock rings beside an arrangement of flowers. To him one was the other.\\" [HarperCollns paperback reprint, p. 215]<br /><br />As a poet, devoted to representing the now as it is, in compressed and revelatory language, not wrapped in treacly Victorian escapism, I understand her latter comment completely. It's hard, but it's a poet's duty. It's a lonely business, even among other poets. Again, Smith says it best: \\"I wanted to be a poet but I knew I would never fit into their incestuous community. The last thing I wanted was to negotiate the social politics of another scene.\\" [HarperCollins paperback reprint, p. 214] Amen, sister.<br /><br />The prose is so reserved, so carefully balanced, it is off-putting to this reader. I would prefer more passion, a deeper emotional investment on the part of the author. But I also realize that might tell you more about me than about Patti Smith. Perhaps it is her her writing style at its zenith. I suspect this because of the generous blurb quoted from Joan Didion, \\"This book is so honest and pure as to count as true rapture.\\" That certainly corresponds to what I read--and am grateful for.

B00AMBK0X4|2.0|We REALLY wanted to like this movie; it fit all the elements we try and look for, as far as originality, fun and something that doesn't take itself too seriously. But we're not fond of language that uses homophobia as a weapon. We've seen Seth MacFarlane on talk shows and he seems like a cool guy, who probably doesn't even realize that using words like gay, and homo, as a derogatory IS bigoted and homophobic. Yes, we are well aware that this is how straight boys talk. However, that doesn't make it any less homophobic. I think where we went wrong, was renting this Unrated version. I bet the Regular version cut some of that foul crap out. There's only 4 minutes or so difference between the 2 versions of the film. So you know neither version is all that different from the other; probably they just stuck back in the foul language, which offers nothing to drive the plot forward, and is certainly humorless. Jokes in good fun is one thing; but that's not what was happening here. We're gonna give Seth a pass on this one, and not assume the worst of him. But we're writing this review to answer the 1 specific question that we had when we rented it. Had we seen a review like this, we'd have known NOT to bother, and we did search the reviews for specific words, gay and homophobic. You can see this kind of juvenile crap from a mile away. We should have trusted our instincts. Homophobes excuse this kind of behavior, and call any protest of it 'political correctness gone overboard' -- we call it bigotry and stupidity, plain and simple. I'm giving it 2 stars for the original concept. Avoid if you care about this sort of thing, if not... go ahead, you might like it. We asked Amazon for a refund.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|This movie made me laugh. It starts out like a childs movie ,but becomes adult very quickly.l've enjoyed the actors in other movies. If you enjoy the Family Guy series you will enjoy this movie.
B000T433CO|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie. I have seen it about half a dozen times now and I look forward to seeing it over and over again. The love story is terrific, the characters are well played (especially the little girls.) I refuse to pick it apart and analyze it line by line or scene by scene. The casting was wonderful and taking it as a whole....it's a wonderful movie.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Fun game good graphics. Plus its free. Can't go wrong with that. Runs great in my kindle fire vs. Highly recommend this app.
B008L0WJQY|4.0|I buy this calendar for my husband as a Christmas present each year.  He enjoys sitting at his desk and starting the day by reading the humorous cartoon on the Dilbert calendar.  As a former Silicon Valley director, he can relate to the corporate antics as depicted on the cartoons.  So can I.  There is space for notations on the calendar just below the cartoon.  The calendar is colorful, humorous, and a nice way to greet each new day.

B004LWZWGA|5.0|I saw this movie in theaters and enjoyed it so very much. I really like the way that they ended the The Dark Night series. This one had me thinking that I knew who the villain was for a very long time, only to find out that I was completely wrong.

B005LAIIPS|5.0|I bought this movie because I loved the The Bourne Movies. I was somewhat sad to not see Jason Bourne in this one as well. However, they have made the Bourne movies more interesting by adding Jeremy Renner into the series. He brings in a whole different view on what is going on in the Bourne Movies.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|For someone who generally doesn't like history books, this book could make me a history buff! Another great piece of literature from 'the' King.

B009X01C64|3.0|This is a great product. Don't get me wrong. It is padded leather and really protective. The leather has a beautiful finish. When you close the cover the screen goes shuts off and turns on when you open it. Nice iPad cover touch. Love it.<br /><br />someone commented that they would have preferred a closure of some kind. The case uses an elastic band for closure. I think I would have preferred a magnetic tab similar to the Belkin. It  makes a nice place to stuff the stylus.<br /><br />The case has a nice soft interior so you won't get scratches on the screen. I added a Skinomi screen protector which is well worth the cost. I like the three position groves in the lid so that you can securely position the tablet for optimal viewing.  You can rotate your Kindle 180 degrees for charging with the case closed. At 90 degrees you can use it in portrait mode. I have had cases for other tablets that use a leather flap for a stand holder. they are not nearly as secure as these groves. I can actually set this stand in my lap and watch a video. That is handy.<br /><br />Here is my big problem. The guy on the video for this product shows how he just pushes on two sides with his thumbs to pop the Kindle out of the case. I have pretty strong hands and it's not popping out. I don't want to pry it out because it might hurt the Kindle finish. I am pretty upset with this. That truly stinks!! I hope that I don't have to take a shears to this in order to get the Kindle out!! FAIL!

I kept playing thinking that there must be a point or something that I was missing but I never found it. You just slice up fruit and vegetables with your finger. Now if I can just figure out how to get it off my Kindle Fire.
B001R0XNSI|4.0|I received this as a stocking stuffer, and all I could do is laugh, partly in amazement, partly in delight. It's a pen that can be used for self defense! Or is it a self defense implement that also writes?<br /><br />As an implement of self-defense:<br /><br />If you're looking for a stealthy self-defense pen, this isn't it. To put it bluntly, this thing is obscenely large. At a little over 6.5\\" long and over .75\\" diameter, it dwarfs most other pens. Even highlighters, known for being rather fat and bulky, look small by comparison. So even in your backpack, or among a bunch of pens, it's going to stand out. I took off a star for this.<br /><br />It's size is an asset in the self-defense role, and it looks like it can definitely do the job! It's fat enough that it fits comfortably in the hand, and should provide good fist support if used in a punch. If used as a striking weapon, or in submission holds, it's solid enough to not bend or break when used. One end is slightly tapered to concentrate the force of a blow or applied pressure. I lightly jabbed a few family members with it and they all agreed (\\"OW!\\") that it was rather painful. Contact at full-force would definitely be a lot worse.<br /><br />Construction seems to be solid. I'm not worried about damaging it.<br /><br />As a pen:<br /><br />It does indeed contain a fine point permanent marker, which does, indeed, write on all manner of surfaces. However, the Pocket Shark's size and construction make it inconvenient (and thus a poor choice) as a writing implement. But that's not why you're considering buying it, is it?<br /><br />Overall, I like it, and put it in my backpack for those occasions when I'm going to be out and about. If you're looking for a tactical pen that blends inconspicuously into the background, this isn't it. This is more like a Kubotan that writes. It's something of a novelty, and I wouldn't trust my life to it, of course, but in a pinch it should be able to deliver that extra bit of \\"oomph\\".It writes, too.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|Jerky to play and not much fun.The graphics are pretty small for the Amazon Kindle Fire HD. I guess if you're waiting in a doctors office and he or she is running late it's something to do. It was free so I didn't expect much.

B009T3AHDE|4.0|To say that COSMOPOLIS isn't for everyone doesn't quite capture it.  This is a film whose plot, such as it is, basically hinges around the value of Chinese currency.  Its central character, young businessman Eric Packer, spends most of the movie in his limo, on his quest across New York City in order to get a haircut that he doesn't really need.<br /><br />In other words: Robert Pattinson's legions of TWILIGHT fans should steer clear.  Not that they will.<br /><br />As far as Pattinson goes, he's aptly cast.  He's able to radiate an emotional detachment, even when he's conveying a sense of ironic enjoyment at the downturn events are taking.  (The best comparison I can think of is Keanu Reeves in THE MATRIX: an actor who, talent or lack thereof aside, was perfect for the part; that being said, Pattinson actually does have some acting talent up his sleeve, and shows it here.)  The supporting cast--featuring Jay Baruchel, Sarah Gadon, Samantha Morton, Juliette Binoche, Mathieu Amalric, Paul Giamatti, and others--rotates in and out, each shining in their own, Cronenberg-influenced way.<br /><br />This is definitely David Cronenberg's film; in fact, it's the first film in years that feels reminiscent of the Cronenberg of the 70s and 80s.  He takes Dom DeLillo's basically unfilmable little novel and translates it beautifully to the screen.  The film founders a bit in spots (it's a tad too long for such an intimate, moral story), and comes off as too didactic in other spots.  Of course, that's the point; there's rarely anything subtle about a Cronenberg film, and COSMOPOLIS is a shining example.  It's certainly not for everyone; but for those who dare to enter Cronenberg's devious imagination, there's a real treat to be found here.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great graphics and story!  Lots of scenes and playing time...well worth the price!  Not too hard but just right for me.

I took Proof of Heaven to another couple who lost their only daughter in October 2012.

For Christmas I gave 5 additional copies to family members. Proof of Heaven  is a must read.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The Hunger games is part of a trilogy.  Despite the fact it is clearly written as such (the following books not an after-thought but an essential part of a whole work), it also stands on its own.<br /><br />It provides an incredibly compelling story.  The model of a post-apocalyptic capital exploiting the people and resources of fragmented societies held in check by military force and, importantly, by the \\"games\\" seems other-worldly until upon reflection it is more like status quo than I'd like to admit.  The sheer brutality of it all, not only of the Games but in the way the government exercises control over the outlier states, is brilliantly glossed over by the government.  The parallels to present day are all too clear.  This book is a classic anti-utopia.<br /><br />Ironically, the weakness may be the description of the Games themselves, where aspects seemed strained in the description.  Part of this is the first-person perspective of the book: only those things evident to Katniss can be described.  The subsequent film, which was remarkably loyal to the book, was liberated from this restriction and was able to show more.  On the other hand, the film by necessity simplified some things, yielding a hurried aspect to the Games there which the book doesn't share.<br /><br />While I really enjoyed this book , when I compare it to some of the greats of the anti-utopian genre, for example Lord Of the Flies comes to mind, the writing seems to fall a bit short.  But I don't want to sell it short: I strongly recommend The Hunger Games, especially if you haven't yet seen the film.  But if you have seen the film, you owe it to yourself to read the original, especially since the first-person narrative is much more intimate with Katniss's thoughts and perceptions.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|A continuation of a captivating Season 1, which hooked my entire family. Season 2 sent beloved characters to deal with darker, more challenging situations, including WWI, blackmail, murder, and the Spanish flu outbreak of 1918-1919. Historical fiction at its finest!
B0067R0APK|5.0|An excellent app.  very accurate for my location (Lake Tahoe, CA).  Which is unusual for a relatively rural area.  I would give it 5 stars if the nice folks who did this would take the SALE! banner off.  THEY TOOK THE \\"SALE!\\" BANNER OFF EARLY APRIL, 2013..  CHANGED MY REVIEW FROM 4 TO 5 STARS.  These nice folks pay attention to reviews.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I've read all the Ferris '4 hour' books and this one is superb (a dead tie with the 4hr body- which, cosmetic enhancement benefits aside, should be required reading simply for the health benefit related points and to debunk the retarded myths about exercise, cholesterol etc. that plague US media, schools, and are one reason so many people are fat.)<br /><br />This newest book is fun and it nails the issue of hacking the learning and the 80/20 notion, over simply mastering something specific. Also, the recipes are superb.<br /><br />Main reason to read this book: computers, iphones, apps, texting and indoor gyms have taken over the soul of the modern world. While those things are great, here Tim reminds the reader about the value of getting visceral with food, knives, and the earth.<br /><br />It's a new year. We could all stand to learn some new skill. This books shows you how in an easy, fun format. Above all, its the spirit and attitude behind these books that deserves praise: lifelong learning is something most have to force on themselves. So have fun doing it.
0756405890|5.0|I had heard a lot of good things about this book from any number of people. I decided to get it from the library so if it wasn't as good as I'd heard, I wouldn't feel that I'd wasted money.<br /><br />My money was well spent!<br /><br />I have read a number of longer books were the author couldn't hold it together for the whole book - no issues here.<br /><br />I have bought the 2nd book (\\"The Wise Man's Fear\\") and it was just as good if not better since we the entire first book of character development. I will be pre-ordering the third book.

B000UJQ9WE|5.0|I personally will always love the Star Wars Trilogy: Speacial Edition. I was 10 or 11 when it hit theaters and it helped cement my love of Star Wars even further. This laser disc set is beautiful and my favorite way to watch this version of the trilogy. Plus it looks awesome on display.
B000I8COBW|5.0|I've always loved this movie, since it's release, and it's definitely worth the money to purchase. A cultural hit that is always fun to watch...!! ;-)
0857685848|5.0|I've always loved dinosaurs and I've always found it interesting how people imagine what dinosaurs would look like. In this book there is tons of that. Beautifully done illustrations of prehistoric art from many ancient eras. If anything it can start up good conversation around the coffee table, haha!
B009RI4FRU|2.0|The previews showed you a cute quirky cast.  Didn't realize that it would go from cute quirky to just strange.  Didn't care for the movie at all.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I downloaded Solitaire in Fall 2012 and play it every day. Yes, the popup ads are annoying, but I found that by tapping the screen under the ad another popup gives me the choice of \\"browse free\\" or \\"skip\\". Another quick tap on \\"skip\\" and I'm back at my game. I can administer those two taps in a matter of seconds, probably quicker than it takes to drag a card from the pile. I admit the video ads and trailers are harder to get rid of, but I don't get as many of them. If you're a rabid game-player or easily annoyed, this game isn't for you, but if you're just killing time and playing for fun, I recommend it. And here's a scoring tip for those who don't know... instead of tapping on an ace (or any card) in the pile and letting it go straight to the upper layout, drag it to a play on the bottom spread first, and play it later on the upper one. You'll accrue more points that way.
B007HIEBV2|4.0|Great music, I like it a lot. If you like swing, and you like electronic music, you will likely like this.<br /><br />Can't say it is the most unique or bring anything new to the table, but it's a fun listen.

B00APUQJLO|1.0|Rambling nonsense.  I watched 15 minutes.  If a director and writer can't establish anything in that amount of time, their work doesn't deserve any attention.
B0058VW36U|5.0|this game is so fun and challenging and the om nom is so cute and adorable I could just eat him up!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|You have to get this game. Its a match game and you can rotate the cube any way you want to. I Love it.
044024630X|4.0|After being seriously disappointed with the last 2 Reacher books (61 Hours & Worth Dying For), hopefully the series is back on track with this book.
B003N0XDT4|5.0|I love DAC's and I was really tempted to jump up to the E17 or wait a little while longer for their newest one.  Depending on your specifications this is either perfect or just a compromise.  For me this DAC amp is perfect.<br /><br />The battery life is ridiculously long.  I have it paired with the Sony NWZ-E465 and the amp often outlasts the player.  The player is rated at 55hrs and the DAC is 80hrs.  The signal strength is usually more than adequate and almost necessary to relive the strain on some vehicle stereos when playing moderate levels.  I am a fan of Wolfson chips and even though this only supports 48kHz/16bit it really cleans up my mp3's ripped at 320kbs.<br /><br />The plug and play when connected to a computer or laptop is also a nice feature.  I rarely use the E7 for this purpose.  I notice an improvement in sound when sourcing my laptop to the stereo.<br /><br />Pro: (Killer App) long battery life DAC for portable applications and reasonably priced.<br /><br />Cons: Not the \\"best\\" DAC as it supports up to 16bit/48kHz and the \\"Bass\\" control has four selectable settings which don't allow you to hit that sweet spot between steps.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />  I've been using this device for almost a year and I did some ABx of different audio files.  I plan to convert my vinyl to digital simply for portability reasons and also looking to downsize my CD collection.  I am excited about the new Fiio X3 and hope this can bridge CD and Vinyl.  I used my Cambridge Audio 650A integrated amp as the switch between my Cambridge Audio 650C CD player and the E7 as the dac for my laptop.  The speakers are Paradigm Mini Monitor v7.  I don't have multiple E7's so I opened Windows media player playing the WAV file from the CD and MediaGo playing the MP3 320K file and then winamp playing the FLAC.<br /><br />  The difference between the 650C CD player and the E7 is there but surprisingly close.  I ABx the Cambridge Audio 751BD player and the 650C and the sound difference was much greater.  The 751BD sounded piercing and lacking bass while very rich in detail.  I no longer have the 751BD so I couldn't ABx the E7 with it, but I'm sure the E7 sounds almost as good as the 751BD which is surprising considering the 751BD is twelve times the cost of the E7.  The E7 processing a WAV file sounds almost as good as the Cambridge Audio 650B CD player.  It's not a fair fight as the 650C is six times the cost, has a dedicated dac per stereo channel, and upsamples the sound well beyond the E7.  I also can't carry the 650C or hook it up to my digital player so the E7 wins a few.  The E7 really loses when the source material changes from WAV to MP3 320Kbps.  FLAC was inbetween.  MP3 and FLAC were better with the E7 than without, but to listen to the music feed the E7 something good and it'll work out the timbre and microtones.
B004UBUNDE|3.0|I expectes images Tork from space but in fact this is a documentary about how it was fixed on space.
0307477479|2.0|The book is warped from water damage, affecting more than half of the pages, and it smells weird. Warped so reading it wil be harder than it should be. Obviously I am not going to bother to return it, but come on Goodwill. I could have purchased this book from many other sellers in better condition and I chose your agency. I wanted to help the cause and I got a slap in the face.
B008US4PBY|1.0|be careful, this device dont works fine, the mods work bad, the controllers the same, also the most important, this guys dont have support, his support is only write you a mail asking about whats happened, and never never replie you, the chat online is the same, but the most important they ban all messages speaking the truth about this device on facebook and other websites, his forum dont exist all users registered are bots or cronus staff members doing new false users and if one user post a bad review from them they delete on his forums, facebook etc, be careful guys. And another good point a lot of users buyed the cronus extreme device, if you buy this with the mod pack of battlefield and recives the call of duty pack keep calm, they ever sends call of duty pack with his card and if you contact with their only can say \\"obiously was a mistake\\" ...... lol good answer.<br />Also dont worry if you see his website the chat support offline, they maybe works almost 2 day per week 2 hours.
B008O69SZ0|3.0|Coming from a long-time fan, this album has the passion and lyrics you've come to expect from Ian. Given that, it doesn't have as many catchy songs as his past few solo albums. You can easily listen to the entire album through but won't necessarily find yourself afterwards thinking that you have to go back and listen to a specific song again.<br /><br />If you're an Ian Hunter fan, you know you're going to buy this regardless of the reviews; you didn't get here by accident and it's not expensive. In terms of expectations, it reminds me more of MTH's first two albums as opposed to the last two or Ian's solo career. Ian's voice isn't as crisp as it was on Rant, Shrunken Heads or Man Overboard, but as always he makes it fit with the music. Listen to the previews and you'll hear what I'm talking about.
B009439HEY|2.0|I realize alot of people who bought this album really like it, and I am a huge Hackett fan(Beyond the Shrouded Horizon should have won a grammy), but 3 minutes into this latest version of Supper's Ready and I pulled the cd out of the player. Why on earth would you have anyone but Peter Gabriel sing this material? The music is basically the same, but even Steve's guitar work is not up to par with the original recordings, please stop shouting at me...just because you've found a vocalist that sounds ever-so-slightly like Gabriel, that's no reason to re-record some of the most fantastic music to ever grace this planet...the remastered originals hold-up very nicely. My apologies to Steve and to anyone else I may have offended, but this is kind of like George Harrison putting-out an album of Beatle songs with Lennon/McCartney sound alikes...what's the point? I realize that I bought the album knowing what I was getting into, and I will continue to buy music from Mr. Hackett, why?...because great musicians deserve our support, that's why.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Reminded me a little of Buffalo 66, a quirky movie that also focused on a football team.<br />Interesting characters, a real family and a fun book to read.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|quirky strategy game using sketches from your own creation! imaginative and fun, I've already recommended it to my friends. I'm surprisingly caught up in the storyline too.
B0091REZMW|4.0|this game is quite addicting. Its ot a game you play continuously because you have to give it time to reload your energy (unless you want to buy some). I usually check in on it 3 times a day.
B00AA0TJO8|1.0|tried several times, but would not load to my kindle, with a message telling me it was loaded and could not be reloaded.. would have really liked to try it out, but oh well.....
B0059XTU22|5.0|I cant believe people dont like this movie, sure i felt CGI was a little over done, but come on look at the detail, the acting and the effort! The Hobbit part 1 is amazing. Sure its not the lord of rings but its something new and it brings the nostalgia rushing back into my veins...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the film and I have to say that I saw the film first. However, as can be expected, the book delivers so much more. You really understand the conflict in each of the characters. The plot is intense and very descriptive. Finished this book in about two days!
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|This movie is based on a silly premise that has no bearing with reality. All the characters have &#34;Potty-mouth&#34;, and this can not be viewed with any decent company. Had I known that Seth MacFarlane had anything to do with this movie, I would not have paid a single penny for it!
B005JZBPHS|5.0|DVD set is a wonderful collection of L Word series. My wife loves it and I get to catch up on the beginning of the series. Highly recommend!!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I was very intrigued by this book; I couldn't put it down! The first 2/3 of th  book was super good, but the last part seemed to slow down a bit. It was a really good book still.<br />I would definitely recommend it.
B006ZDS7CE|1.0|she is awful. first time i heard \\"video games\\" i thought it was a bad joke from the local morning radio show. and then it just kept going. other songs of hers were no better. she makes me want to surgically remove my ears.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Pretty good graphics, ok story line, and it's a hidden object! Well worth the download! Good all around in my book!
075669812X|5.0|My son loves this book.  It came with the figure too which did not happen in the stores.  Thank you
B00946ZOT8|5.0|I got this for my little sister for Christmas. It looks almost exactly like the actress and is very well made. Worth the cost.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|The songs from this musical are inspiring, funny, and lovable. The music brings great emotion especially if you've seen the movie and can visualize scenes while they okay out, even if you have not seen the movie the music really tells the story.<br /><br />I wanted this album so bad, mainly for Dreamed A Dream and Master Of The House as those are my favorite and was willing to pay $15 to iTunes for them.<br /><br />The value off amazon almost makes me feel like I stole it.
B00AE2J5HI|3.0|I rate this movie 3.5 stars. I enjoyed the storyline and characters. It had a little bit of everthing. Action, Romance, Drama, and humor.
B004I744AS|5.0|Vast resource of information. Easy to use. Not just a dictionary but includes brain teasers and games. You will not be disappointed.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Runs the player around a lot to find all the pieces to solve all the puzzles, which are constructed fairly.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I very seldom recommend a book to friends.......but this is one of those that my friends simply have to read.<br />I kept on thinking I had uncovered the secrets, only to find they kept going deeper and deeper.<br />I think my dominant thought throughout my reading was: How on earth did the author manage to keep track of all the trails and characters while writing? I found this an extremely intelligent read with rich and complex characters. I have recently read so many shockingly edited Amazon ready lately that I was beginning to despair of the entire process, when, gratefully I discovered this flawless and beautiful novel.<br />Thank you Kate.
1594744769|4.0|My Kindle is now 2 years old, and I don't intend to replace it, but could barely make out the old photographs that are part of the allure of this book. Luckily, the book can stand on its own without the pictures.<br /><br />This is the coming-of-age story of Jacob, a whiny rich boy from Florida who discovers that the world is more complex and wonderful than he ever imagined. Which is good, because the world he lives in is full of boxes of disposable underpants -- what a vivid image!<br /><br />The world is also infinitely more dangerous than Jacob imagined, leading him into great peril in this book and sending him to confront greater perils in the promised sequel.<br /><br />Jacob's initial snarky, self-indulgent tone (which I think is what led one reviewer to say he sounds like Lemony Snicket, but maybe the author intends to sound like Holden Caulfield) fades as the book goes on. I hope the sequel dispenses with that tone of voice entirely. Jacob was becoming really tiresome to spend time with.<br /><br />If you want another intriguing story about super-normal people in society, check out \\"Walking the Labyrinth\\" by Lisa Goldstein (no relation to me). That one is told from the perspective of a mostly-grown-up woman, and is a stand-alone novel.
1451695195|3.0|I think the word 'Proof' in the title is a little much. I expected something more tangible. I don't doubt what the Dr. experienced but the book is more about what was going on with his family and friends while he was in coma. I found his account of what he experienced in the afterlife was fleeting.<br /><br />I know the Dr. intends to release another book about his experience with the target audience being the medial academia community. Maybe that text will have more of what I was looking for.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow!! Is what I have to say and a Big long SIGH..... Holder and Sky have quite a story, one I won't forget for a while. Sky (adopted as the story goes) has been home schooled her whole life, is not allowed to watch tv,internet, have a cell phone, E-reader, or anything that involves technology. Several of those are deal breakers for me, especially the e-reader.LOL She has been sheltered, except for her bestfreind Six, who has secretly given her a little taste of technolgy. Sky is high school age as well as Six. They eat ice cream and watching movies at Six's house. Six loves boys, but Sky feels nothing for any of them until Dean Holder steps back into life and sees Holder at the grocery store. While Six is away for 6 months, Sky and Holder meet and connect. Neither one of them is prepared for what life has to offer them. (neither was I)They form ties that make me shiver as they become closer, and realize that they knew one another 13 years ago. A riveting story and difficult to read as well at some points in the book. It teaches you about the many facets of love and how far you are willing to go for someone you do love, and how to forgive when you are not sure how or if you can.
B002N5N5QQ|1.0|Disc wouldn't play. Kept skipping. Waiste of money<br />Product unacceptable.<br />Should have purchased this product in a place that would accept returns
B000JO9JHW|5.0|So crazy good. This show makes me feel al most like a normal person. I can't wait to see season 2
1419705849|5.0|My son requested this book for Christmas.  It came in super quick time and he read it Christmas night and said he thoroughly enjoyed it.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This book was rated as a five star.  It is a very good book and was a page turner.  John Grisham's books are always great.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|My sis bought this to read so I was bored and downloaded it. It was a quick easy read and would be great for little kids.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Great read!  I'm not typically one to read Steven King's novels; however, this one was excellent.  It made you think about bringing changes to things.
B006R1T40I|3.0|i hoped for more. this cd is just ok, but to tell you the truth there are several tracks on this cd i simply skip over, including the one so promoted on the outside of the cd, right down the line. i don't think that one is any great shakes.  the original was better, IMO.
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|i took the advice of a revered public radio station on this cd and it does not disappoint, even a year later i like it, and listen and enjoy. will be looking for their newest soon.
B00005QDW5|5.0|This product worked as desired.  My son loved receiving it as a Christmas gift.  The CD was not damaged in any way and played perfectly.
B008EZVNO0|5.0|this cd strikes me like easy listening jazz, with van's inimitable style kicking it up several notches fro most. no rocker, but then IMO he never has been. just what i was looking for.
B000FA5TTW|5.0|My son suggested this book and I was very pleasantly surprised to joy this book and author. I hope you enjoy it too.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|Picture quality less than poor. Too much lag time. Never got past the first few credits. Would not try this again.
B002RKSZWG|5.0|This is my favorite of the Jane Austen books.  It is a story of redemption and second chances.  I could read it over and over again!
B006MR2ZQC|5.0|My grandson has wanted this lego set for months... when he unwrapped it Christms morning .... He was soooooo happy.. I was so glad I had gotten it for him.... he is a lego expert and this was one of the most fun sets to put together...  I received it right on time that I was told to expect it... I am very happy with the fast ... always on time... service from Amazon
B000FVE3AC|3.0|My son-in-law was very pleased to receive this watch as a gift.  However none of the adults present could rotate the outer rim as the directions instructed to get it to pop up and then proceed with the setting process.  The band is quite large and has to have at least 4 links removed so hopefully a jeweler can assist with the initial set up of the watch.  I was a little disappointed that it was so complicated to set but since the band was so large it couldn't be worn immediately.
B006LRUVUA|4.0|It would be nice if the tablets screen could except taps without having to move the cursor to the tap area. I am using this on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|It was gooood! I was pleasantly surprised that it was really good!  It's interesting how it tied in with actual historical facts! Awesome!
B007BVT5N4|5.0|First of all I'm A GROWN WOMAN with Daughters that loves Justin and I also grew to love him. I give this book a 5 star in rating bcause I actually read this book and give him much needed respect for being able to share his life with his fans. He's also great at what he does.
B007UXSPK2|4.0|It was good! A lot of actions! Tom cruise was great doing all stunts himself! Awesome! Awesome! More! Sequels? Sequels!!!!!
B004VD3YIM|5.0|This application works great. No problems. I have a Wansview n541 everything  works, including the two way audio. The scan function makes it easy ti find all cameras in your network.
B003JTHWJQ|4.0|This was an enjoyable read. Clearly written from a strong anti-religion position, it was well written, funny, serious, entertaining, offending, but overall prompted serious reconsideration of many  beliefs and attitudes about god and religion that we take for granted. Read it with an open mind, and it will either prompt you to question your beliefs or solidify your arguments in their support!
B00280LYIC|5.0|It was really good! I enjoyed it but the books keep getting better and better! Five star rating for this book.:)
B0086213XW|4.0|Maybe because I knew this was not going to be another ha ha romantic comedy from reading other reviews, I wasn't disappointed with this movie at all. I enjoyed it from beginning to end. It felt authentic. It shows how we're carried away by our own desires and the little discontentments we let creep in and opening doors we know should be kept shut. It wasn't over the top, it was sweet and sad and very well acted by all involved. It's not a romcom - it's not, it's just a little slice of life, warts and all. I enjoyed this movie, if you watch it with the expectation that it's really a drama, you'll enjoy it, too.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|The game is  alot of fun , it was easy to download from amazon, of course.  Really like amazon.  I would recomend this game to anyone.  My grandson likes this game also.
B008XX6J4C|4.0|Quality was excellent, music was beautiful but it did not bring me to great emotion.  I would, however, recommend it highly to classical music lovers.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|this game is the bomb ppl u should get it some levels r hard but its still really fun ppl should get it :)
B00164GDA0|5.0|The wonderful film, Stand By Me, added so many more nuances to the Stephen King novella on which it was based.  When I first saw it as a child, I loved it, even though there were moments that genuinely frightened me.  Watching it on blu-ray now is a whole new experience - the dynamics of the relationships between the four boys, moments of sadness, moments of hope, and yes, still some moments of fear.<br /><br />This blu-ray 25th anniversary includes commentary from the now adult actors Wil Wheaton and Corey Feldman.  I only wish that River Phoenix was alive today to have taken part and so that we could have seen how his acting would have developed in his adulthood.  Fortunately, we have this lovely film to give us an idea of what could have been.
B002UZ5JJU|5.0|I liked Angela for not being perfect and not being also stubid like Bridget J. was. Though it's not easy to forget that it is not possible to get to US from UK withought waiting for visa a few weeks ;) Anyway it's a piece of good and funny literature for girls that makes them forget about daily plain life.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|Terminator 2 was an improvement over the first film, even though, in my opinion, I preferred Ah-nuld as the evil Terminator.  Nevertheless, this film has an exciting, tension-filled story, with special effects that still look great all these years later.  James Cameron was one of the first filmmakers to place women in the traditionally male action role, and Linda Hamilton makes the most of her opportunity here.<br /><br />The blu-ray extras have just about everything you could ask for, and at the current $5 price, this is a steal.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|I enjoyed this more than I expected.  I don't usually like the silly, slap stickish movies, but this one was OK
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|This movie was good to go!!! Pierce Gagnon (the kid in the movie) is an AMAZING child actor.<br />He is cute, adorable, and his acting abilities are astonishing. I watched this movie twice. Very good!!
0393088774|5.0|This book is easy to understand. Mr. Krugman breaks down information into easy to understand examples. Everyone should have this book.
B000SW2F8K|1.0|Dont waste your time or money on this movie. I thought because Penelope Cruz was in it, that it was guarantee.<br />Its a crappy movie, the plot, the character lines are dreadful.
B004TI5N38|5.0|David Baldacci can really keep me tied to his books. His ability to spin a tale of intrigue is unmatched. I cannot wait for the next one!
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|Great book - can't wait to read the rest of the series.<br /><br />I laughed out loud reading this book<br />And the Dragon is so HOT.
B0091REZMW|3.0|its small on the kindle fire. but its fun you just have to zoom in a lot. graphics are good though
B00ARAO1LC|4.0|I love Matthew Mcconaughey, but in this movie he was scary creepy good.  It has a twist worth waiting for. I recommend this movie to any suspense lovers with a strong stomach.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I've been looking for the next John Grisham novel. This isn't it. It's an amalgamation of law, love, tragedy and mystery. A great read!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this series. I think Suzanne does a great job showing how much Katniss cares for both Peeta and Gale.
B005LAII3A|3.0|Not bad...but for some reason I just didn't care about the characters in this version.  Maybe it's because I loved the 1990 version so much.  Great action sequences but they did tend to stretch out at times and I just wanted them to end and get back to some story development and dialog that would make me care about the characters involved....overall decent, but the 1990 version was more fun and had much better character development...
B009IEXKXI|5.0|The Martian was a very pleasant surprise.  I got caught up in the story and finished it in a day, enjoying the book all the way through.  The surprise was that this book was so good and so cheap.  I hope the author writes more books, I'm sure they would be well received.
0440419514|5.0|These are great books and a truly fun read! Good for any age reader and the boxed set looks nice on the shelf as well.
1426308469|5.0|Bought as gift for my 4 year old Grandson and he loves it. the dealer was good and shipped as soon as possible.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|This story is unlike any other would usually read. I'm not a mystical, fantasy reader but I was entranced. I wanted to learn the purpose of the game. Don't we all?
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Awesome book I love it so so much you should read it it was worth $7.99 it is really funny.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I like that this movie is not just a big tree hugging fest but actually teaches accountability to children instead of nature worship. It did an excellent job of teaching children (and adults!) the importance of caring for the resources that we have without making me gag.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|Too sarcastic for the setting....can he ever not have a smart mouth. Especially in a most feared terrorist country.....he really needs to tone down a much loved character....and be realistic.:)
1466401885|3.0|I read this is a day, not because it was that good but because I just felt like reading. I thought the story was pretty interesting and I liked the characters but I don't know... it was just alright.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Love this show- and the extras are great too!!!!<br />The acting is great- the story lines are terrific- Highly recommend!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Suprising good book, heard a lot about it online and found the price great picked it up and loved it
B008QTV3X0|5.0|This is one of the best shows on TV.I can't wait for season 2 to be available. When might that be?
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I expected this book to be mindless and entertaining. It was entertaining, but not mindless.<br />Though erotic and sensual, it really is a love story.... a great love story. I believe at a time when people are too quick to give up and not fight for what they want, this book is actually uplifting. Sometimes love means sacrifice and humility.....
B000AGTPUK|5.0|the dvd was great! thanks! I gave it as a gift for Christmas, and my friend's son loved it! Thank you!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I liked this book because it was funny I chose the rating I did because I like diary of a wimpy kid books I would reccomend this book to anybody who likes humor
B008Y73940|5.0|The Lincoln Lawyer has been on my to watch list for some time and I have finally been able to watch it.  It was the best movie that I've seen in a very long time.  The storyline is very well written and keeps you guessing.  I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone looking for a great drama, suspense movie!
B002SRQ214|5.0|If you have a motherboard that has a socket for an AMD2+ or AMD3 CPU, and it can handle a 125W CPU, then this is what you want to order soon before the AMD3 CPUs are no longer made.  Be sure to check that your motherboard can handle 45nm and 125W CPU before you order.  I originally ordered this for an HP s5611f, only to find that the motherboard there could only use up to a 95W 45NM CPU.  Fortunately, I had another desktop with an old AMD 840 CPU that was 95W 45NM and the motherboard on that machine could handle a125W AM3 CPU.  So I moved the old CPU from that PC to the HP PC and installed this CPU in the old PC.  Now both computers work great and really fly!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was unsure about reading the book. I knew it was written for the young adult but it kept me very entertained. I look forward to seeing the movie and reading the next book.  Its a Great book for all ages.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|Great movie.  My husband loves it.  He had already seen the first one, and was very excited to see this sequel.  Thanks for great service and fast shipping.
B0012GMYI2|5.0|This is the one that seperated Accept from all the others at the time. Restless and Wild is a must own for any Accept fan and if your lucky enuff to see Accept today despite their new found fame with Blood of the Nations and Stalingrad, their concert still revolves around the good ole stuff and Restless provides the power for alot of it. No Accept concert is complete without the song Restless and Wild. Although you will also get Neon Nights and if your lucky Princess of the Dawn.<br /><br />  Neon Nights and Princess of the Dawn are the two standouts on this one for me. Long excellent rockers, that showcase the bands ability to break songs down and build them back up again. Wolf Hoffman lays it down on these tracks.
B007HACDLK|4.0|This is not as exciting as previous books because perhaps the scenario and actions are very similar. However,<br />any Vince Flynn book is worth reading and I liked this one.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|This is one of the best good feeling movies I have ever watched I would recommend it It's one you want to see over and over
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|It's such a great concept, and it's so well done. I started playing yesterday and couldn't put it down. This isn't a game you'll play for weeks, probably - there aren't that many boards - but you'll love every minute of puzzles and interactive scribbles.
B0070ZLZ1G|4.0|This book provides a realistic view of the issues in the field education. It gives good insight and provides interesting statistics that should open eyes to the importance of early intervention especially when it comes to impoverished and neglected children.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I can't wait until I read the next book! This was exciting from the first to the last.Loved it! Great

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I love all of Rick Riordan's books, but the heroes of of Olympus books are my favorite ones. Anyone who likes lots of action and emotion and a little bit of romance will absolutely love this book and any other book in this series.

B003JTHXOK|4.0|Very good read. I enjoyed the story -I thought I knew the ending but what a surprise! Sparks is a great story teller.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I couldn't put the book down. I read it in 2 days. I have never read a book that made me go through so many emotions. I smiled, laughed, cried, hurt, and got so mad. But it was a great ending. This book touched what really happens in reality and most people don't even see it or know it. Great book.
0307352145|4.0|Susan Cain writes a highly credible non-fiction piece in this book. She includes a tremendous amount of research and it was a fabulous read. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because between chapters 6-8 she gets very scientifically technical, which diminished some of the pleasure of reading the book, and at times she rambles about things that I don't think are really relevant. Overall, though, the book is rife with eye opening realities of how our culture values the extrovert and is killing creativity. As an educator, this book caused me to reflect on my classroom practice, and I am going to rethink things and do things differently because of this book. What Cain says is relevant and really gives insight into the importance of those who are quiet. She reveals that in the early 1900s our society shifted from a civilization that cherished values to one that hails the loudmouth. While the loudest person usually attracts attention, and respect according to Cain, that person has not truly thought things through. Cain also shows what it is that makes people truly gifted in an area. This was reinforced just after I read it when Bryant Gumble posed the question, \\"Why is it that South Korea continues to have so many players in the opens?\\" Then, they went to South Korea and found that they have inner city golf ranges where players practice 5 hours a day! Cain explains this in the book. It's an eye-opener and everyone should read it because if you are an introvert, it explains why you like things the way you do, validating your ideas. If you are an extrovert, it shows that not everyone thinks like you do, and points out that some of the people you devalue may be the most valuable people you see in a day. A good read.
B004T4KQJS|4.0|Very informative and well written.  It is cerebral, so be prepared.  I would recomend this book to anyone that has at least basic understanding of cosmology and theoratical physics.
B009VB7P6G|4.0|Another great Tinkerbell movie!  We loved the two sisters who were born from the same laugh.  It was wonderful to see the two cultures come together to save the magic tree.  Our family really enjoyed this movie.
B004GGTAQE|4.0|Excellent story of the German Army and the Panzer's role it played on the Eastern Front. Acurate and tells a good story of the trials the soliders faced against the Russian Army and their offensive..
B001NAT05W|5.0|We love this movie - lots of action and a great story about the mystic Cat Woman.  Patience is a woman who's been \\"caged\\" by her passivity, but after she's wrongly killed, a cat saves her and breathes magical powers and life back into her.  Patience comes back sassy and strong.  Cat Woman is born!
B000RJO578|5.0|This is one of the funniest british movies in a long time. The cast are brash and bold and when they act and react it is all the way.  The whole thing is so far fetched that you just can't  help laughing at the irony dripping off of every surface.  There is no particular message, except that Hollywood still fails to recognize the stupidity of making the same cop movies over and over and over and..... you get the idea.  Dirty Hairy and Die Hard were interesting the first two or three times but Lord help me if I ever end up in hell watching an endless loop of &#34;DeBeque and Barnsville CSI Special Squad.&#34;  This movie treats the good cop forced beyond the bounds of legality to defend the peace with about the respect it deserves, none.  The climax when the confiscated (Spoiler Alert) Polish wz. 08/39 contact naval mine the local pig farmer had in his barn explodes really tears at the stomach, as you laugh yourself silly.  Buy it, give it to a friend, have him give it to a friend and so on.
B0011UBDTK|4.0|I LOVE SEX AND THE CITY!!!! But, the DVD Set that I received was not great. A few of the episode skipped in my DVD Player and it was the first time playing the DVD. But, overrall it's an awesome set to have! I do recommend if you're a fan like me!
0345803493|5.0|Orderad as a used item. Recieved product in great shape as if just off of store shelf.  Good buy, good book, Thanks
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|I love Mark Wahlberg and Seth MacFarlane is absolutely hilarious too - so this movie was perfect for me!  The movie is really vulgar, but absolutely HILARIOUS.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|Could not put this down. I preordered it on my Kindle. I was traveling at the time and it arrived around midnight on release day.
B00ARA4SLU|4.0|I'm not quite sure why 2 similar movies about director Alfred Hitchcock come out at the same time.  The other being \\"The Girl\\" (HBO) which I haven't seen, but Hitchcock was certainly an interesting character.  This film, set during the development of \\"Psycho,\\" focuses primarily on his relationship with his wife Alma Reville (Helen Mirren).  Hitchcock (an appropriately corpulent Anthony Hopkins) loves making movies and after the success of \\"North by Northwest\\" is anxious to start his next project.<br /><br />After reading about the serial killer Ted Gein, Hitchcock decides to make a movie with a similar theme.  This horrifies the studio (Paramount) and the censors.  Eventually Hitch (he liked to be called Hitch as he tells his newest star Janet Leigh, \\"drop the cock\\") has to finance the picture on his own.  The most interesting thing about this movie is Alma who was an excellent filmmaker herself, but had subjugated herself to work with her husband.  Ms. Mirren steals the scenes she's in as the no nonsense professional.<br /><br />I remember Janet Leigh being interviewed several times and memory suggests Scarlett Johansson hits the perfect note as Hitchcock latest blond beauty.  Directed by Sacha Gervasi, the film seems to get off track at times.  This is particularly noticeable when Hitchcock's subconscious images of Gein (Michael Wincott) starts talking to him.<br /><br />Although the movie only runs 98 minutes, it feels a bit bloated.  Still the movie includes a good impersonation by Hopkins that includes Hitchcock's famous wit.  This is best shown at the opening of \\"Psycho\\" as he playfully \\"conducts\\" the orchestra and screams coming from the theater while standing with a shocked usher in the lobby.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Perfect. Other people were compaining about the disk not playing and at first I thought I had the same thing, but it just took a while for the bluray players to load everything that is on the disk.
0345803485|5.0|This is an amazing book.  It is the most erotic romance novel I have read.  I could not put this down once I picked it up.  You may as well get the 3 book series if there is a cost break,.  Once you read this 1st book in the trilogy you will be hooked.  You will want to lock yourself in your bedroom or bathroom for some alone time once you get into this story.  I bought 6 of these books for my sisters and friends for Christmas gifts and they are all hooked too.
B0001ARCFA|4.0|they fit nicely and the release at the headset works well but any song with notable bass sounds crappy like airplane headphones.<br />if you listen to only acoustic guitar music these are great, if you listen to skrillex, deadmau5, five finger death punch, incubus, or anything with any kind of bass (drum, guitar or synthetic) forget them, there's better headphones out there for the same amount of money.
B00AMBLDEE|1.0|Other than flashing a few shots of the original story movie, this had nothing to do with the Bourne series.  A total waste of time!
B00AE2IJIE|3.0|It was OK, My kids loved it. My wife and I have seen better but it was entertaining and we really just got it for the kids.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|I love this movie.  Based on a true story this film is very nice.  Touching, yet amusing.  The only problem I had with it is that I ordered it in November for a Christmas Present and I still don't have it.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|love this game the best game I got on my kindle fire since I got my kindle cant stop playing this game
B0094M0P4G|5.0|It has really great music. It gets you moving. Burlesque is really great for a feel good movie. All the Actors and Actesses did an outstanding Job. Cher can still command the scene no matter what she is doing. Christina Aguilera did a fabulous job. I didn't really care about her music, but now I am starting to listen to her music..If you like musicals this is a must see to add to your collection!!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I had no idea what this book was about before I bought it.  Since the first page it has captured my attention.  Very good book.
B004EK926K|4.0|There are several holiday classics that I'lll watch every year, and Jim Carrey's involved in two of them.<br />I'll look for one of the older offerings of A Christmas Carol, but then watch this one too.<br />The collection of recognizable actors and the quality of the digital animation attract me, but what knocks it out is the adherance to the original story and dialogue.<br />This is a &#34;suspension of disbelief&#34; favorite!
B0017I1IZA|4.0|Stephanie Plum is hiliarious I cant get enough of her adventures.  Her and Lula never disappoint. This is series is the funniest I have ever read.
B009O2XY12|2.0|Boring and uninteresting. Tons of other games i would rather play. Don't download. Blah blah blah blah blah blah poop
0143121006|5.0|I loved this mystery novel - I am a lover of non-fiction and I thought Mr. French did an excellent job of presenting what life in Peking must have been like before the rebellion.  I could not put it down.
B008UFUOH6|4.0|The first song on the album, &#34;Joy&#34;, is pure inspiration.  It is an &#34;any day of the year&#34; song that crystallizes the greatest of life's truths.  The others songs are delightful as well, but &#34;Joy&#34; stopped me in my tracks and commanded that I listen and re-listen to it's sweet message.
0380973839|1.0|I was disappointed - it was a 'cheap' version of the book - small and on inferior paper.  i was disappointed but didn't have any time to research another one - it was a gift.  This has happened before when i've used Amazon.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|I did not like it because it was boring but more intelligent people will like it<br />Because the book is about smartness
B007HACDLK|4.0|Like all Vince  Flynn's books I read it in 2 days and it seemed too short. Its the sign of a good writer that can captivate your attention with a hero and keeps you coming back for more stories and adventures. Thanks Vince.
B000W9399S|5.0|The first in the Discworld series, and I am fairly certain this came from the British edition. Terry Pratchett is *always* good reading, no matter what.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|wasn't really moved by the movie, the promo was the best part.  I was expecting a lil more from Seth.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Kate Morton is able to keep you guessing in this book to the very end. I have read all of her books, but this will reign as the best of her craft. The does a masterful job of weaving the characters in the story that you become familiar with them--or think you know them. I liked the historic background of the story as well. It lends a thread to the plot.  Kate Morton is a master storyteller!
0385535147|5.0|Edge of your seat exciting!The book's Content was GREAT! I loved it, spellbinding! Almost to last pages before all was revealed!!
B009VB998I|4.0|Kids loved it.  Better than the past couple Tinkerbell movies.  The story is decent, but could have been a bit better.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|I have found a fictional man almost as good as Jamie Frazer from Ms Gabaldon's Outlander series, and it is Robert, the main character. Such emotion, this author knows what she is doing.
0399157565|5.0|Finally!  I thought Ms. Cornwell would never go back to her interesting and captivating novels.  She is definitely back on track.<br />I do wish she would not try to turn Lucy into superwoman who can leap tall buildings in a single bound or maybe in a helicopter.  I like her best when she lets her characters be human and not super human.  There are X Men for that.<br />Jdith Key
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I think this game is so awesome but the only problem is that I can't connect with a kindle fire hd but besides that it is really awesome
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I love Patricia Cornwell and she did not disappoint with this installment of Scarpetta either.  Very well done, a great read.  I highly recommend it
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|well this game is great but in the office I don't get it I chose the hint it led me to the office then another hint I choseit led me to his locker then another hint led me out of the locker then in the locker then out I'm only 9 and I don't think I'm liking this I'm very upset
B007MDB548|5.0|This is an excellent product for the little ones.  They love all the Disney fairy movies and this one did not disappoint
B004TI5N38|5.0|When you see a title by Baldacci you can be sure it's going to be an enjoyable several hours entertainment! That is if your in the genre... So far I've read each of his books and never been disappointed: good and evolving storyline, clear characters; what else could you ask for?
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|I download it for my children and they loved it so much I never got to play it that day
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awesome book. I can not wait to read the next two books in the trilogy. The book is very well done
B005HSL626|5.0|My grandson wanted this one, so I put it on for him and he really loves playing it.  With both of us slicing, it made it even more fun.  Giggled his little tooshie off!
B004X6PRO6|4.0|This is a well written book.  This is a stark picture of government and life in North Korea.  It is sometimes hard to follow the action.  Is what I think happening really happening?
B00006GEB4|5.0|I’m not gonna lie to you. I’m not the biggest Flaming Lips fan in the reviews section. I like most of the songs on War with the Mystics and I very much enjoy their rendition of The Dark Side of the Moon with Stardeath and the White Dwarfs and co. This album is my one and only complete favorite.<br /><br />From the entrance with Fight Test, I always get some goose bumps. There’s just something about a live show that excites me. Granted, it isn’t a live album, but the entrance with the “audience” certainly plays to that feel. Fight Test is actually an accidental almost cover of another song by Cat Stevens: Father and Son.<br /><br />With the album starting off strong, it slowly and melodically moves towards the more familiar Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots pt. I and Do You Realize? Are You a Hypnotist also took me by surprise. It starts out a little slow, but really has a fantastic vibe to it.<br /><br />I bought the LP version of the album, so I got to experience the additional cool factor of unwrapping a vinyl. The record itself is a cool translucent red that looks pretty fantastic when spinning on a turntable with the slightly raised, center cap style drive. It was nice to see the Made in Germany, rather than China like everything else.<br /><br />I’m not really how to tell someone to buy this album, but even if you aren’t a huge fan of the Flaming Lips, I think you’ll really enjoy it.
B002G1K82Q|5.0|If you were in college in the 60's and 70's, you will love this movie -- especially if you like Beatles music. The acting, music and choreography are all excellent. Be aware that this is a musical before you buy it. This movie is about me and my culture in my earlier timeline. If you arrived in this world after the Vietnam conflict and Beatles music, you probably won't appreciate it. For me, it was perfect, so I gave it a 5-star.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Great way to move files to or from your Android devices. Nice for organizing where on your device the files are also.
B007KAJG3K|5.0|Loved this movie. At purchase was the 2d viewing after viewing on Amazon instant video. Have watched the movie twice since purchase shows I liked this sequel just as much as I have enjoyed the first movie. I hope there is another just as good, but who knows if another Sherlock is featured. The price was just right was waiting, shipping fast as always so thanks! Amazon. If your like suspense and a little comedy you'll love this movie if you have not seen it already. Oh yeah! the haters will hate, check it out for yourself.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|this is a great game,lots of fun, although there are a few gliches that happen from time to time, such as &quot;invisible&quot; enemies that aren't there but the system think they are, so i lose the level. No big deal, minor setback. All in all, love it!!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|The ES File Explorer is working great! I didn't know about this app til I read the &#34;Mastering the Kindle&#34; ebook (free). It is a fantastic addition to my Kindle Fire 2d Edition for transferring Microsoft Word & Excel documents and finding them quickly on the device. Before it seems so cumbersome a experience. Now this are organized and there's file folders already that exist you can use. If you just got your Fire or have one already I recommend this app (free) that will cut the headache out of file management within the Fire environment.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|This book I gave a 4 because a like when the guy strikes. I like all the books in the diary of a wimpy kid series. My favorite book is the second book. I like that book the most because they have a huge party.
0307951529|2.0|This book is a perfect example of how to sell the obvious in a creative package and thats what youll be buying basic economics a  paperboy knows in a creative marketing package.Most everyone knows the relationships between revenue,costs and how volume and price increases can effect profits .This book teaches paperboy economics as though its novel or as though the biggest obstacle to starting a new business is understanding how to price product and balance the books.Its always funny how many books sell the concept of everyone becoming a \\"consultant\\".The fact is most people with the true ability to be a profitable consultant in this economy dont need to be told about it.If you have a sound startup concept you probably wont need this book and if you dont have a sound startup concept this book will be worthless to you unless you qualify to  be a great consultant but dont know you do.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Love, love, love this game! Stickman Epic is the best! I can seriously play this game all day. So many levels and they're all interesting and creative. Try it for yourself, you'll love it too!
B001NAT05W|1.0|Think this is the worse hero movie to date I've seen... perhaps I forgetting another one but can't image that it would be worse than this.  Upset at myself for watching the whole movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft Is my favorite game even on the Xbox 360 Edition! Go buy it! The &quot;Cyan&quot; Flowers are supposed to be a rose.I don't know why we can't make armor in Minecraft.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I started reading this book because it is the Jan 1 selection for the Goodreads scifi/fantasy reading group. I started early but I just finished it a little after midnight on New Years Day so I counted it towards the first book in my goal towards 50 in 2013.<br /><br />This book is actually a compilation of 5 short stories (one not being all that short). The story is clean, fast moving and the characters are believable and one is able to feel empathy at times towards even the worst of the villains. The author writes male/female, good/evil, young/old all with an insanely clear voice. Each character being distinct with clear desires, motives and pains. A love of science fiction is not even remotely needed to enjoy this story. There is so much to say but I don't wish to have any spoilers in my review.<br /><br />Simply put, I recommend the book with the utmost enthusiasm.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Great game:) Great service, timely response rate and I appreciated all the help :)  I Recommend it to other players
