B00005JLR2|4.0|This was a really cute movie, and has an awesome Goo Goo Dolls song in it. I purchased it for my 4 year old after he saw the preview for it on another movie we have.   The reason I didn't give it five stars is because my son was not happy with it. I think they showed all the good action shots on the preview and it took to long to get to them in his opinion. I, myself liked the movie a lot, though.
B001KMB6X2|4.0|Very cool, with all the typical action sequences of impossible near misses and inhuman agility and ... oh, heck.  If you've seen XXX or Pitch Black, you know what to expect, and this movie delivers.
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|Have no Trek-nophobia, this new Star Trek manages to keep the visionary appeal of the original while providing visual appeal of updated special effects and a fresh young cast.  This \\"prequel\\" brilliantly changes the rules of the game by providing a cover story for all the anomalies created by re-casting the original characters.  It leaves room for a whole new series of adventures.<br /><br />This is first and foremost, a taut action thrill ride.  The Federation under attack by a mysterious Captain Nemo, who has both impossible knowledge and superior weaponry.  With most of the fleet on an extended mission, Star Fleet empties the Academy.  James T. Kirk is not the experience captain but a raw recruit; Bones is a medical officer with a fear of space; and Spock is the only member of the crew to have his commission.  Spock and Kirk are not friends, but bitter rivals.  As events spin out of control, they must collaborate...<br /><br />Action, humor, favorite characters brought to life for another grand adventure...this is opera and it sings!

B001PPGAIK|5.0|For all the romantics, realists, and wish a \\"near\\" clean sight of an older and much more real time where things were the way they were. If you loved another you said so; if you hated another; one way or another, you said so, or did something about it. This story has the hard real facts and the actors to appropriately protray them with unusual protrayal as having the real feelings. As is \\"Gone with the Wind\\" has taken its' place for all time, Australia will site side by side with it for all time.

0596005903|4.0|I have read both this book and Sreekrishnan Venkateswaran's Essential Linux Device Drivers, both are excellent,  I prefer this one on generic topics such as:<br /><br />Chapter 5.

The Linux Device Model<br /><br />How ever Sreekrishnan's book covers video and audio driver which are useful for my work.<br /><br />As for styles,  both keep a good balance of \\"how\\" and \\"why\\", I think the \\"why\\" parts are  more important, the whole s/w is all about concepts.
B000W91RUG|4.0|This set is cool, but I was expecting better though. No individual cases (just one with the 3 discs), and there's no bonus material except a 15 minutes documentary.    Anyway, the show really deserves to be watched, it's really incredible! It's funny, smart, original and the cast is just great. Plus, the price is ok, so you can buy with confidence.
B000MV90B2|5.0|No extras, no audio choices, just the movie.  BUT, it is available on DVD again, finally, and unlike the old VHS which I have suffered with for years, it is letterboxed, and all mine to enjoy in it's entirety.  If you love a good historical re-creation of a huge event, this re-staging of the battle of Waterloo is magnificent.  I would compare it to Gettysburg, although only the central action is re-created here, with two of the side actions only alluded to, but I do think this is the best we will ever have on the subject.  Buy it now before it disappears again!
B000FS9MV0|5.0|I bought this album after listening to only a couple of songs and absolutely love it.  She is such a great talent and can sing a variety of songs from blues, jazz, ballads, show tunes, big band music, you name it.  She is as good as some major celebrities and I'm wondering why someone isn't promoting her to the top.  She could do it all.  And a duo with Michael Buble would be outstanding.
B001AJVR5M|5.0|I was in the store the other day looking for music that says \\"Hey I'm a man's man\\". Not in a prison sort of way.. In a way that shows I have a pair.<br />  I came across this boss looking CD. I knew instantly, deep in my subconscious, this was the golden nugget that will fulfill my dark and dreary world.  As I unraveled the plastic wrap from this gift of the gods I felt a tingle go through my body.  Angels sang and it seemed as if the world stopped moving.<br />  I have an appointment tomorrow to upgrade my car stereo to epic proportions.  It is my right, nay, my duty to share this music with all those around me as I cruise through this city of lost souls.  I believe, wait.. I know the Jonas Bros will change lives, at every stoplight I come to.  I am contemplating removing my car windows permanently to share maximum decibel level.<br />  Thank you Jonas Bros. And watch out ladies, there is a real man in the car next to you.
B001U0HBQ0|4.0|I just watched this on Blu-Ray last night and loved it. Not being a fan of movie theaters, I much prefer to just wait and have the home theater experience. This one was well worth waiting for!    Many of the scenes looked great on the big screen in high def. The sound was also high quality, however, I had trouble understanding some of the very low level, slightly mumbled dialog from the woman as she laid in her hospital bed.    Since I have only seen this on Blu-Ray, I can compare it with a standard DVD. What I can say is that I am quite sure that the picture quality must be superior since I know what upscaled standard DVDs look like and this is definately better - and worth the extra cost in my opinion.    In short, I thought this was a great movie - a real keeper that I'm sure I'll want to watch again.
B000B5XOSO|3.0|Just wondering how this 2-disc version, which just now came back into print after being out of print for a bit, looks and sounds and compares to the original single-disc DVD version? How are the extras? Is there a Tim Burton commentary? What is the quality of this?    Thanks.

I tried reading the book at 19 and the language was too difficult and complex to grasp, so that could be the problem many readers faced earlier.  Later in life it makes sense.

B0009FU0ZQ|4.0|This was the first in a series of movies in which Tom Selleck brings to life Robert Parker's creation, Jesse Stone, and highly successful it is too.<br />Selleck brings to life this world weary and imperfect character - a moral man, full of imperfections but who wants to do the right thing and has the instinct to do it.  He is an ex big city policeman, now a police chief in the sleepy town of Paradise, population 25,000.  He is battling alcohol, and is unable to let go of the memory of his ex wife, who calls him regularly.  All in all, a much more flawed character than we are used to seeing him play, but he does a terrific job, and brings his gravitas to create a character who, in spite of his flaws, we see as an upright man.<br />Trouble starts when an investigation into a murder  quickly develops into a serial murder, with no apparent motive.. meantime, the investigation into the gang rape of a young teenager is ongoing, despite pressure to let it drop.  None of it is anything new to the genre, but  it is written with a satisfyingly slow burn approach, sucking you into the lives and characters enough to make you care what happens to them.<br />Although the subject matter sounds harsh, the telling of it is realistic, and relatively slow moving and subdued for a modern show.  Frankly, for this viewer that was part of the appeal - no blaring soundtrack, no hyper fast edits - just good story telling.  However, if it is an action movie you are after, best look elsewhere.  This is a character piece, where the thriller elements are unsurprising, but the script and folks you meet along the way will take you willingly along for the ride.
0790729725|5.0|Really great movie. Considered one of the greatest in Cinema history. Some rate this over The godfather's as the greatest mob movie. Fast moving and gripping. This really shows De Niro as one of the greatest actors in our generation. Oddly enough, after the first viewing I didn't realize his character was actually him.  Some pretty good life lessons in the movie also. Must own for guys!
B001FB4VZS|2.0|I was deeply disappointed with this season. This is the WORST season by far!!! There is no LEX (okay very brief appearance) and the female character sent to replace him is a feeble replacement for the powerful Lex. There is only a brief appearance by LANA. Smallville spent seven seasons building Lana up as the love of Clark's life and then, to fit the model of Superman, abruptly changes gears and tries to force a relationship between Louise and Clark. Honestly, the show should end with him and Lana together. It would not be in keeping with the traditional makeup of Superman (e.g. comics, movies, other TV shows) but Smallville isn't like every other incarnation of Superman. From the beginning it had distinct differences such as making Clark friends with Lex and especially the relationship Clark has with Lana. In the movie with Christopher Reeves, Lana was a crush he barley had contact with and in Smallville there was this richly developed loving relationship.     The VERY FEW good points of this season is Lana becomes more independent and strong-willed. Also, Chloe becomes more assertive and begins to develop a life where Clark is not the center. Yet, you can still see a pining for the great Clark. Really, they need to let her let that one go and what happened to sweet Jimmy? Chloe is like that Katy Perry song \\"Hot n' Cold\\" in the end it seems she never truly loved Jimmy because of Clark. I have read in other reviews how Clark begins becoming more of a superhero. That is true but there is still a need to have this process sped up. Really, Clark you can't kill the bad guy. You would rather have the bad guy kill everyone on earth then for you to kill him. Give me a break!! GROW UP!!! Sometimes being a superhero is hard and he needs to start learning that lesson NOW. Season eight to me is simply awful with many of the beloved characters gone and the few that are still around seemed forced to fit the SUPERMAN MODEL that just doesn't apply to Smallville. BE BOLD SMALLVILLE AND BREAK NEW GROUND. THE SHOW DESERVES IT!!!!  Bring back the Smallville that was so great!!
B0000696I1|5.0|The third in the live action TMNT moives is actually much, much, much better than what most say it is, plus there is no Vanilla Ice.     The Shredder is gone and with this movie there is time travel and action but no Shredder which is ok since this movie did not need him. The locations in this movie are very beautiful and the story was actually decent.     We get to see Raphaels more tender side as he befreinds a young kid, almost touching if you will. We get to see Casey!?! or maybe it is one of Casey's ancient relatives. We also get to see some ancient warriors in the present and how they react.     I think this movie was good and would recommend it.
0064410935|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite children's books. It is a heartwarming story about the relationship between a lovable pig and a spider. It is a wonderful book that will teach children about the meaning of love while, at the same time, helping them to develop empathy for some of God's other creatures. It is also a wonderful book with which to prepare children for the death of a loved one.    The author imbues Wilbur, the pig, and Charlotte, the spider, with delightfully human characteristics. It is a wonderful fantasy. Yet it is really a love story. It is also a book that demonstrates the ongoing circle of life. For these reasons, the book has a spiritual dimension.

B001P9KR8U|5.0|As a born and bred Bollywood fan I am of course also a fan of this movie. Thrilled that a non-Indian director took interest in the culture, tragic poverty, and stunning beauty of India. Underlying premise of the movie is very interesting. It suggests a possible answer to the question \\"Why do we all go thru the @#$% that we do??\\" AR Rehman's music is phenomenal, an all-time creative best (in my humble opinion). Was this movie Oscar-worthy? Maybe, maybe not. Is it a must-see? Most definitely.

B001O5LVPI|5.0|My 4-year-old just recently watched Lilo and Stitch as a rental, and when i saw this 2-disc DVD set I decided to buy it. Besides the fun movie [which I love as well], there are many bonus features here which make this DVD-set a worthwhile purchase.<br /><br />The story of Lilo and Stitch actually makes for quite a refreshing change from Disney's previously princess-obsessed features [not that there is anything wrong with that, but this makes a nice change]. Set in Hawaii,the main character Lilo, is a little orphan girl with emotional issues who has a caring but frustrated older sister [who can't seem to reach out to her]. Enter an inter-galactic mutant alien who lands on Earth, hides [from two other aliens who have been commanded to get rid of him] in an animal shelter and is promptly adopted by Lilo, who names him Stitch, and the adventures begin. There are plenty of catchy island songs, fun moments and even poignant scenes that will engage and entertain viewers.<br /><br />The bonus features on Disc 1:<br />- feature-length audio commentary by the film's directors, Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois<br />- \\"Your Ohana\\" music video featuring the Hawaiian Kamehameha Schools Children's Chorus set to clips from the film.<br />- Lilo and Stitch Island Adventure Games, i.e. \\"Gecko Race\\", \\"Hamsterviel's Coconut Shell Game\\", and \\"Hamsterviel's Match Game\\"<br />- \\"Disneypedia: Hawaii - The Islands of Aloha\\" which is an educational journey narrated by Lilo and Nani about the state of Hawaii and its six biggest islands with footage of volcanoes, luaus etc.<br />- \\"Create Your Own Alien Experiment Game\\" where one can guess which order three substances should be mixed in to randomly produce an experiment.<br />- \\"A Stitch In Time:Follow Stitch Through The Disney Years\\" where Stitch is creatively interwoven into other Disney classics through the years.<br />- \\"Hula Lesson\\", all about the Hawaiian dance form.<br />-\\"Burning Love\\" - Behind the Scenes With Wynonna<br />- A-Teens'  cover of Elvis' \\"I Can't Help Falling In Love With You\\"<br />- \\"Animating The Hula\\"<br />- 4 theatrical teaser trailers. i.e. \\"Inter-Stitch-ials\\" which introduce Stitch through other Disney features like \\"Beauty and the Beast\\", \\"Aladdin\\", \\"The Little Mermaid\\", and \\"Lion King\\"<br /><br />The bonus features on Disc 2:<br /><br />- one of the more substantial features on Disc 2 is the approx. 2 hr-long making-of documentary, featuring insightful interviews with the people behind the animated feature.

B00004YA66|5.0|The DVD Frequency with Dennis Quaid, includes Time travel, using a ham radio,that links the present with the past through an unusual storm and Northern lights.  John Sullivan, played by Jim Caviezel, a cop, links to his father, Frank Sullivan,played by Dennis Quaid, a firefighter,who was lost to him due to a tragedy of a fire. The Scifi is intensive, but very interesting.  I recommend this to those who like Scifi and Time Travel. My order was promptly acknowledged and arrived in good time.

B001JSTKNA|3.0|At first I couldn't get into this girl, But after hearing her name so much  I got curious. She's actually pretty cool, I'm glad I kept an open mind. I came across some great songs to add to my iPOD. She actually has a good voice for Pop/Dance music, I like it alot. As for the music, I like just as many songs on this album as I dislike. 'Just Dance' 'Poker face' 'Nothing Else I Can Say' 'Money Honey' 'Paparazzi' 'I Like It Rough' & 'The Fame' Are the only songs I like from the album which is not bad. I don't care for anything else on the album. Still, I give her the benefit of the doubt because I heard alot of her songs that didn't make the final tracklisting along with bonuses & live performances of songs that aren't released here. So through that I got a chance to experience how diverse & capable of delivering good music she is. In my opinion, \\"The Fame\\" doesn't showcase Gaga's true artistry, Which is a shame because she's so Creative with so many fantastic ideas I feel as though the public is missing out because of what's selling these days. I will definatley be looking out for her next release, Can't wait.
1423101472|4.0|I teach mythology as part of my 8th grade English classes and have enjoyed all the previous books in this series. And I enjoyed this one, too. The internal conflicts are heightened, as Percy has several key decisions to make. Of course, with Kronos threatening Olympus, there are enough battles to satisfy the most eager fight fan. My only quibble is that far too often, Riordan comes up with some new method of saving the day. It's almost as if he writes himself into a corner by putting his heroes and heroines in jeopardy, then has to invent a new way to save them. Sometimes the rescues are logical, but sometimes they're just too extreme for my taste.   That said, this is a fitting end to, as the Acknowledgments call it, \\"the FIRST Camp-Half-Blood series.\\" It looks as if more are planned, given the new prophecy revealed near the conclusion. And that would be just fine with me!

B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|I've been watching Star trek my whole life, and, was eagerly anticipating this release.  I was not disapointed great perfomances by all.  I was a little bit disapointed in Spock but no one can play that role like Leonard Nimoy.  So I gave them a little break..  Bones was my favorite.  Damn it man I'm a Dr. not a Physicist.  If you like star trek than you should love this movie.
B001AVEJ1Y|4.0|First off, let me say I thought this film was good, full of action & excitement, but having watched all the shows (except Voyager) & all 10 past films, I really was disappointed that the writers & filmakers chose an alternate timeline, Vulcan's destruction & the death of Spock's mother makes some \\"TOS\\" episodes & the films \\"Star Trek I, III, & IV\\" no longer exist, this is quite a disappointment, & the fact that the show \\"Enterprise\\" has been constantly critisized for certain inconsistencies & no one is making that same argument here based on current reviews leads me to think that those critical of \\"Enterprise\\" never really watched it or they just didn't like Scott Bakula's Captain Archer, anyway despite this, the film is well done, Karl Urban really captures Dr.McCoy's mannerisms, no suprise there, he did the same thing playing a younger version of Tommy Lee Jones' Woodrow Call for \\"Commanche Moon\\"(\\"Lonesome Dove's\\" prequel), the guys playing the younger Spock & Sulu were really good picks & very true to the characters, Sulu weilded a sword in the TOS episode \\"Naked Now\\" & the woman playing Uhura was also a good pick, Bruce Greenwood was very commanding a Pike, much like the original character, however I am still unsure about Chris Pine as Kirk, sure he captured some of Shatner's mannerisms, but I am not sure he really looks the part, I had a hard time believing he could evolve into William Shatner, the guy playing his dad at the beginning looked more like a young Shatner than Pine did, & would have been a better choice I think, Simon Pegg was half & half on Scotty, he had the mannerism, but was bit goofy, unlike the original Scotty, Ben Cross was good as Spock's father Sarek, as was Winona Ryder as his mother Amanda, they really reminded me of the older counterparts in the 80's films, & finally Eric Bana is again underused here just as he was in \\"Troy\\" who's Romulan echoes that of the Picard's clone in \\"Nemesis\\", in fact it seems they couldn't come up with nothingbut a retread of \\"Nemesis'\\" villian here, this is what happens when you put a non-fan in the director's chair like J.J. Abrams, who is a good director, but him being a non-fan really shows here, again you would think that Paramount would have learned from all the complaints fans had about Rick Berman & Brannon Braga on \\"Enterprise\\",but then again do stuido cheifs really care about this franchise? NO!!! just how much it will make & what name they can attach to it, this new film is an attempt to capture new fans & give older fans the finger in the name of the almighty dollar, however when you watch ST:NG's \\"Yesterday's Enterprise\\", there are parallels somewhat in regard to an alternate timeline, & \\"Deep Space Nine\\" was guilty of doing episodes like this too, as did \\"Enterprise\\" with the \\"Mirror Darkly\\" episodes, which is how I see this film, an alternate timeline pure & simple, can't hate this one since the shows did it too.

B001PPLIEG|4.0|Car chase?  Check.  Beautiful female agent?  Check.  M bugging him all the time?  Check.  Gadgets galore?  Um...not so much other than the cool computer that projects on the wall.  Ugly villains out to oppress the world?  Check.    All of the usual components of a Bond film are here with the addition of an angry 007 who is out to avenge the death of his girlfriend.  This was done once before in the series when Bond's newly-wedded wife is killed, but a lot of time has passed since then.  Also besides the car chase, there's a boat chase and an airplane chase thrown in for good measure.  The action is constant from beginning to end and the special effects are at times breathtaking.  Bond fans will surely enjoy this latest film.
B000UJCALI|5.0|Well this is probably hands down the best psychological thriller ever put to film with the exception of psycho. At any rate if you have never seen this masterpiece....shame on you!

Goodkind is quite good at establishing a scene so that I feel like I'm there.

B000R7HY0K|1.0|So this movie was a double feature with Rodriguez's Planet Terror and usually Rogdriguez's films are pretty bad, enjoyable but bad. The results for Rodriguez's Planet Terror were basically as usual, maybe a little better, but the unfortunate thing For Tarantino was that his part, which is Death Proof, was so bad it actually made Planet Terror seem like a classic. Yes, being a big Tarantino fan who has enjoyed every single film he has made up until this point, it was something of the unexpected but frankly speaking, Death Proof was so darn boring. Usually the long dialogue is a major part of where his movies shine but here, it's just plain stupid nonsense going on forever, it's not interesting at all. And at the very very end, like for 20 minutes or so we get this chase scene which doesn't come near as close to covering up for the lame hour long crap we had to endure up until then. The people who have enjoyed this movie I believe are only the people who were able to enjoy the long dialogue scenes which in my opinon was not the same case compared to previous Tarantino classics. The dialogue scenes were so bad, I really had a hard time staying awake and that wasn't because I was in bad shape when viewing this, actually quite the opposite so that should give you an idea of how bad this movie is. I recall that this Grindhouse double feature totally flopped at the theaters and those who have seen this all know why it did so bad. I have a very open mind even for bad movies but man, this movie is as boring as films can get. Avoid at all costs and even if you're a big Tarantino fan, I would suggest viewing any of his previous films rather than going for this one, no matter how much time you have.

B001MEJY8W|5.0|Just saw it yesterday and all I can say is \\"Wow!\\" For a person who has seen just about every horror film there is out there, I wasn't expecting to be depressed but that was exactly what this movie did to me, in a good old fashioned horror way of course. I will not give any hints to what this movie is like since it will ruin the fun(?) but I will say that people who felt largely let down by Frontiers will be in for a great treat. This is what that film failed to accomplish. Many people here have complained that the second half of this film is not that great and I admit it is a little slow, repetitive and not so violent as some may expect it to be but I believe that it was done in the best way possible which is to attack you in psychological terms, not necessarily in a physical way that many torture-porn films have come to be (not that I dislike them, quite the opposite!) Anyhow, if you've enjoy the recent French trend, I believe this is the ulitmate one, next to Inside, both which won't be topped in a long time to come. Last but not least, let me just note that my wife who has endured many horror films with me like the recent Saw movies to Dario's Mother of Tears totally felt disgusted with this one only. Hope you enjoy!

My yard is not level and we sometimes have problems with children's pools, because the weight of the water pushing on one end is too much for the wall, but I think the shape of the pool does help keep the walls from sagging under pressure.<br /><br />It's a nice pool.  I'd get a larger next time because my children are older.  I'd recommend it for preschoolers.  It's a bit deep for toddlers, unless you watch them very closely or don't fill it completely.
B00005LIN0|5.0|I read about this performance in Alex Ross's \\"The Rest Is Noise - Listening to the 20th Century\\" - a wonderful book, by the way.    I live in Australia where, because of the copyright conditions of the Gershwin estate, \\"Porgy and Bess\\" is rarely performed. I'm a classical musician (singer, conductor) with a low-level professional career behind me. I have yet to see \\"Porgy and Bess\\" live.    It is hard to imagine a better staged performance than this one. The singing, acting and orchestral playing are wonderful.    Having recently read Barack Obama's \\"Dreams From My Father\\", I wonder what a contemporary African-American makes of \\"Porgy and Bess\\" these days. Do they wince at the lyrics? (\\"Hebben\\" for \\"Heaven\\", etc.) Is there a feeling that it is (or purports to be) an African-American story told by non-African-Americans? And if so, how do they feel about that?    Like any work of art, \\"Porgy and Bess\\" is of its own time. I found it harrowing and, eventually, possibly-a-bit-hopeful. Or is Porgy just deluded?     I thought it well worth watching (and listening to).     Highly recommended.
B001RTP3Z0|4.0|Given there are so few LC video/dvd concert recordings available, this is a must for LC fans.  The sound could be better, the camera angles could also be better.  Leonard gives a chilling performance.  Song after song - full of wisdom, humor & honesty, and the band is fabulous!
0517548232|5.0|This is a simple, but amazingly profound, mind blowing introduction to some basic economic principles. The principles outlined here are quite simple, and yet it seems so many people today can not grasp these basic truths.<br /><br />Granted this book is a bit dated, but most of it is still useful and much of it seems as if it were written today.<br /><br />I sincerely wish more politicians and voters today would read this book, it would go a long way toward restoring some knowledge of basic economics and some common sense to the decisions that get made on the political sphere.<br /><br />There are many economics books that are so dense that I would take no delight in reading nor would I feel comfortable recommending to someone who is not already an economics wonk. However, with this title, I have no such reservations. I can wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone. I guarantee it will be enlightening in at least one or two areas!

0930289234|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised with this graphic novel.  I was expecting some light comic fare but was immediately grabbed by the gritty and dark world.  Enjoying the character and setting immensely.  Highly recommended.  If I find this in a large form factor, will probably buy it too as the artwork deserves to be enjoyed to the fullest.  An excellent buy and great value.  I did not have any previous knowledge of the Watchmen and have been avoiding the movie and surrouding hype to ensure I got the best out of the original book.  Glad I did...
B000W93CXQ|5.0|this book is truthful. any teenager can relate to parts of the book, especially the rumor spreading concept.
B000E5N6LG|4.0|I have always loved this rendition of the Wyatt Earp story over the \\"Tombstone\\" version.  \\"Tombstone\\" seemed to be more about Val Klimer's Doc Holiday character.  I like how \\"Wyatt Earp\\" tells from his childhood.  Enjoy!
0688152023|5.0|I love picking up this book and doing the workouts when it comes to boredom. Great descriptions of the workouts!
B0018BB20W|5.0|This is my favorite album, and has been for more years than I care to admit. I had it on 8-Track, vinyl, and now have it on 3 different CD iterations. One CD was not remastered at all, the second was the '97 remaster, and now the 2008 remaster.    Overall impression? Of course, the material itself is excellent, as always. The bonus materials gives an insight into the band at that single point in time, and that alone makes it worth the purchase. The sonics? Well, the orchestral work has better clarity and feels more vibrant, but the dynamic range feels limited and has a compressed feel at times, though it doesn't get in the way of the experience. I actually enjoy the orchestra parts more on this release than on any other.     The band portions are a different story. They often feel pushed too hard, the volume driving almost to the point of distortion. There's a real sense of compression that should have been avoided. Still, there is better clarity and the stereo mixes have a more effective feel.    With all that said, I still prefer CD this to all the other DOFP releases I've owned over the years... and it is the best one for the car!
0312383320|4.0|[[ASIN:0312383320 Plum Spooky (A Between-the-Numbers Novel)]]  Cute book.  Not as crazy as some of the other between the numbers series. I found it enjoyable to just breeze through.  Easy spring/summer time reading.
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|So it doesn't follow canon.  Big deal.  There was never a dull moment.  I can hardly wait for the next one and for this first movie to come out on DVD.    As an aside, I would really like to see Shatner in the next one.
B000ZN8036|5.0|The first time I saw this movie, I was speechless, the 2nd time I saw this movie I was speechless.    Just watch it, it is the most amazing journey and the outcome, the result of Alexander Supertramp is ... I am not gonna spoil it for you.    Best movie of the year!!!
B001AVEJ1Y|4.0|I can't believe that the best review and the worst review are both critiscising the new Star Trek movie.  I thought the introducion of the \\"old characters\\" was really well done and how they captured the essense of these characters, that everyone knows.  It was not a secret that this ST movie was about the first Star Trek crew and for fans of ST going to see this, if they did not emmulate the \\"original\\" characters then everyone would be complaining, again, saying how they were nothing like the original cast.  Damned if you do and damned if you don't.  The Romulan mining ship reminded me of the time ship from the episode Year of Hell pt 1&2 in Star Trek Voyager, only far more imposing which made the start of the movie absolutely amazing and totally unexpected for a ST movie (Thank God!).  ST Generations & the other ST NG movie's, (can't even remember the name of them now) only ever had about 5 mins of action at the end & the rest of the time was spent wandering when it was actually going to start or end.  Those ST-NG movies overdid the moralising and were far too intent on verbally explaining everything, when this is not always necessary.  If you go to watch a sci-fi action movie, you expect action, in space, not talking.    This new ST movie was so refreshing, an entire ST movie where it was fast paced, action packed, quickly introduced the characters, had funny moments and it was great to remember and see old characters.  The story plot was fine, you understood easily what was going on, without all the excessive talk.  This ST movie will be a great success - unlike the others, which deserved to flop at the box office.  I was a huge fan of Vogager because of the action, not because of the talk.  This is where I felt ST-NG fell over, too much talking, not enough action and too many space dwelling organism's that are supposedly intelligent beings... that they must communicate with - silly.  At least in this movie they are fighting against an actual opponent whose technology is far superior.  Roll on the new series of ST with the new characters and tons of action.  Even if you are not a ST fan or loved the original ST, this movie will re-ignite your interest in the show
B001AVEJ1Y|3.0|Minor Spoilers ahead:<br /><br />I admit: it was a well-made and somewhat entertaining film with a decent cast. But many of my fears were realised -- Time travel and alternate universes in Trek have been done-to-death already. Also, the 'vengeance for my dead wife' plot motivation? Oh please!! And playing Scotty purely for laughs is an insult to the memory of James Doohan and the dignity he brought to his character. Also: U.S.S. Enterprise only *just* being launched with Pike in command? No! Pike got to command Enterprise for about a decade first. And Kirk making Captain in his mid 20s after one adventure, just out of the Academy? NOT even in the gravest of wartimes would such a scenario happen. Also, Chekov on the ship while Kirk is in his mid-20s? But that would mean Chekov is about EIGHT years old?!! And Warp Drive is a series of quick 'Battlestar Galactica' \\"jumps\\"? Yuck!! And they fly to Vulcan in a few minutes when in Star Trek: The Motion Picture it said it would take FOUR DAYS?<br /><br />Why dumb these details down, when a few 'strokes of the writers pen' would fix them?<br /><br />I give the film a solid B for entertainment value, but C- for er, \\"Faithful Trekkiness\\". And I'm SICK TO DEATH of the \\"lets wobble the camera violently during action scenes to try and denote excitement\\" motion-sickness, A.D.D. syndrome. That can be a crutch for lazy editing. Next time I see it on a large scale in ANY film, I'm walking out...<br /><br />I don't care if that marks me an 'old-fogey'.
B000W7JWUA|3.0|We bought the game based on a write-up in Wired magazine.  The game play is great, and our family of four (ages 9-45) loves playing it.  However, the construction of the game is exceptionally poor.  It's hard to set up and get the pieces to hold together.  Further, we have spilled drinks while playing and now a number of pieces, board and cards, are needing to be replaced.  Given the cost of the game, I would expect better coating and construction overall.  The company needs to do something about that.  I would have given it 5 stars but for the poor durability, setup and construction.  Given that this is a German game, too, I would expect build better than a six dollar Monopoly board.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This video is an awesome workout.  I've done level one for two weeks and built up enough endurance to advance on to level two.  I have recommended it to all of the people who have noticed a difference in me already!
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|I have been going to movies for over 50 years, Gran Torino is the best I have ever seen. Mr. Eastwood always hits the nail on the head. No one else could have played \\"Wally\\" as well. Not only is he a brillant actor, he is one of the best Director/Producers in modern day Hollywood. I can't wait to see his next project. However, it will be very hard to top Gran Torino.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I purchased the Belkin, and was unhappy with its layout and joystick controls for movement. I ordered the logitech and what a difference. I can highly recommend it.
B0007MWZEK|2.0|My Gran bought this for us, and I feel terrible that she wasted her money on it. What a piece of junk. Right out of the box, it missed a lot of stuff on the floor. It certainly isn't meant to replace a proper vacuum cleaner. We merely use it in the kitchen now, and even then, I generally have to pull out our upright vac if I want it totally clean. I cannot believe this thing retails for over forty bucks! Save your $$$ and get a lightweight vac for smaller jobs. It's about as good as a push vac.
0307269191|5.0|I was very pleasantly surprised by this book. I like Murakami well enough, read several of his novels, but must say that I enjoyed this non-fiction book of his even more than his novels. There is a genuine-ness in it that is  extremely appealing. His feelings and thoughts are of the kind that everyone who runs can relate to in an intimate way.
1400064287|4.0|While this book had a lot of examples that involved management in a business environment, there were also plenty of examples that were taken from an academic setting and basically any other place you could think of where someone in a position of leadership needs to get things done. The main idea of the book is that we need to keep our minds open and be able to \\"think out of the box\\" by trying things that may seem to contradict common sense. This book is for anyone who is curious as to why some ideas become successful and others do not and tends to have a lot of ideas that can be put to use specifically in a business environment.     There were quite a few things I liked about this book. The clinics provided a different way to help the concepts sink in and the fact that there were cross-references was also helpful, but what I think really made this book stand out from the rest was the outline which is sort of like a \\"Cliffs Notes\\" version of the whole book; it's easier to find something later on if you want to use it as a reference book.
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|J.J Abrams's reboot of Star Trek is anything I have never seen before in a reboot franchise with a wonderful cast with the original Spock Leonard Nimoy making a cameo and his comeback to both the big screen and the first Star Trek film for him since 1991's Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, amazing Visual Effects from the support of ILM and a good screenplay from the writers of Mission Impossible 3, Transformers and the sequel Transformers: Revenge of The Fallen and the co-creators of Fringe with Abrams. See this movie even you or you are not a fan of Star Trek. I can't wait to see this on Dvd and Blu-ray.
B000056JYB|4.0|First disc is a real gem, but second disc is a yawn and to make the matter worse the last track ends without any fading as if someone just pulls the power-cord of the CD player!
B001IBIQU6|3.0|I don't agree that \\"Sounds Of The Universe\\" is Depeche Mode's worst, nor do I believe it is their best. So no one star rating or five star rating. I don't think this album is above average or below average, which rules out a two star rating and a four star rating.<br /><br />This leaves me somewhere in the neutral middle. Why? Well, I liked \\"In Chains\\", \\"Hole To Feed\\", \\"Wrong\\", \\"Fragile Tension\\", \\"In Sympathy\\", \\"Peace\\", \\"Jezebel\\" and \\"Corrupt\\". I did not like \\"Little Soul\\", \\"Come Back\\", \\"Spacewalker\\", \\"Perfect\\" and \\"Miles Away/The Truth Is\\". So that's a split right down the middle.<br /><br />Do I think Alan Wilder should come back? Yes. I think it would give the band a shot in the arm. Do I think \\"Sounds Of The Universe\\" proves Depeche Mode is a has-been? No. In fact, each Depeche Mode album is unusually solid, but uneven, this decade. What's strange is that the band doesn't seem to realize that the 80's New Wave is acceptable now, and even fashionable. The band keeps hovering over its \\"Songs Of Faith And Devotion\\" period, which is fine, but not anything that's pushing the limits of their creativity.<br /><br />Here's my comparison chart for \\"Sounds Of The Universe\\":<br /><br />1981 Speak & Spell: Three Stars<br />1982 A Broken Frame: Three and a Half Stars<br />1983 Construction Time Again: Three Stars<br />1984 Some Great Reward: Four Stars<br />1986 Black Celebration: Five Stars<br />1987 Music For The Masses: Five Stars<br />1990 Violator: Five Stars<br />1993 Songs Of Faith And Devotion: Five Stars<br />1997 Ultra: Four Stars<br />2001 Exciter: Four Stars<br />2005 Playing The Angel: Three and a Half Stars<br />2009 Sounds Of The Universe: Three and a Half Stars

0439023483|5.0|I finished this book in a day, I could not put it down. The characters are so engaging and the story is wonderful. It has the same feel as the movie Running Man (if you know it). I cannot wait to read the next book!!
B0000714BP|5.0|I'm a hetero male, but I got a kick out of \\"To Wong Fu...\\"     When I first saw it a few years back. I even mentioned it was a delightful movie to a gentleman over dinner with a group of people, and later learned he was gay. He told me it was my fondness for the movie that made him feel safe to \\"out\\" himself to me. We're good friends and keep in touch since his relocation to California.    If you're a gay basher, don't bother..this movie will only upset you. If you believe in live and let live, then this is a film worth viewing. Great cast, and -- although I was born and raised in Pennsylvania -- it taught me the proper pronunciation of the ritzy Philadelphia area community, Bala Cynwyd.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|This is one of the best sitcoms to come along in a very long time!! I can't wait for Monday nights to get here, so I can watch it. The cast is extremely funny, and have a great chemistry! I agree with others that have said, \\"everytime you watch an episode you catch something you didn't catch before\\"! Sheldon and Leonard, are my heros, wish there was a \\"superhero\\" tee shirt with their pics on it! This show is a MUST WATCH for sure.
1416562605|5.0|There is never a dull word much less moment in this fascinating fictional account of how a poor farm kid from rural India became a wealthy entrpreneur in the city of Bangalore. By now, many of you have probably seen the Oscar-winning movie \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" which I loved, but somehow reading this novel felt more real to me than watching that movie.     In this book, the characters cannot be categorized simply as good guys or bad guys. Instead, they are all portrayed as flawed human beings doing their best to survive while enmeshed in dysfunctional social traditions. The protagonist is just as deeply flawed as any of the so-called villains, a fact that seems to have disturbed some other readers, but in my opinion is at the essence of why this novel seems so psychologically and emotionally authentic.     There are so many things to like about this book that it is difficult to list them all, but they include the detailed characterizations, the visual imagery, and the sense of having a new world revealed to you from street level with the turn of each and every page. This novel is a page-turner that is consistently entertaining, but one other aspect needs to be mentioned: ever since finishing it, I have felt a profound sense of gratitude for basic amenities I had become complacent about such as running water, sewage systems, electricity, and public education!    Addendum: I would like to point out that my review is in no way a response to the multi-page rant written by Pankaj Saxena (or Saksena - it is spelled two different ways), and the fact that my review is published right after his is purely a coincidence. The only response I might venture to his comments is that I believe most educated readers of fiction understand that a novel is not journalism or a documentary, and should not be interpreted as such.

B001IAOEXU|5.0|So far soooooo GOOOD! >:) Takes some getting used to at first since I was so used to pressing really deep with the R2 and L2 buttons, but after putting these bad boys on, you don't have to press too deep. The outward curvature of the buttons also cradles your fingers so your least likely to slip off during those intense trigger happy fights.
0800141660|5.0|The most wonderfully adapted movie version of Jane Austen's Sense & Sensibility ever made with never-to-be-forgotten characters played by highly acclaimed British actors and actresses with beautiful English landscapes and scenery.  Watching this film turned my husband into a huge Jane Austen fan!  It is a joy to read this novel and then watch it vividly brought to life on the screen by such fine and accomplished (and stunning) actors.

The book takes you into Africa, in a manner that makes you want to approve of things you are against<br />Chinua Achebe crafts such a powerful insight into a culture that has made it one of the most distributed novels of our time.<br />The influence of the British culture on an African society and the demons of a protagonist whose definition of his being, is based on his culture.<br />A book that has and will continue to impact generations
0060899220|5.0|I love Anthony Bourdain. He's cynical & intelligent & loves food & cooking & being alive. He's a pleasure seeker of the first order. He's honest & knows when he's been bad, self-destructive, or boorish. He knows how to laugh at himself. He likes The Sex Pistols & Television & The Cramps. He rocks!<br /><br />This book is well-written and often hilarious. I found myself laughing out loud while reading & then having to say, \\"Honey, hold up, you gotta hear this.\\" My sweetie, having spent many years on the line in everything from Mexican to Italian to 5-star French kept laughing, then shuddering, then saying things like, \\"I've had that day.\\" This was followed by more shudders & general cringing and the tale of the drunken Belgian pastry chef who burnt his puff pastries & threw an industrial-sized tray hot from the oven at the dishwasher's head. The dishwasher escaped decapitation and 3rd degree burns because he knew how to duck.<br /><br />Bourdain is honest & brutally funny & combines his personal experience in & of kitchens with historical tidbits and other analysis. Anyone who is dreaming of opening a restaurant should his chapter, \\"A Day in the Life.\\" It'll make whatever desk job you're currently doing look pretty darned good.
0440178002|5.0|Welcome to Japan, its a masterpiece of a story that takes you into the heart, the pride and culture of Old Japan, in a highly intriguing storyline, flanked by an exceedling engaging group of characters.<br />The only weakness to this story, which is not a weakness, is the author, James Clavell isn't Japanese. Which fortunately doesn't take anything from the classic nature of this literary masterpiece, but it makes you wonder how an outsider would be able to craft one of the best works of the Old Japanese Empire in this present time.<br />A western sailor enters ancient japan in a time of war, and is used as pawn to play the premature war of the minds of leader, seeking to rule an empire.<br />It slow to build, but after the first 100 pages, you would thank the heavens for letting you read it.
B000R7GKQE|3.0|Overall not as good as I had hoped.  I preferred the first season to the second.<br />The series still follows the two brothers on their adventures across the country.  Though the second series starts to reveal a lot more of foundation of the story to the audience.<br />I give the series high marks for visual effects, and for interesting episodes (which had to include a lot of research, etc. in order to write them).  It is watchable, with some funny dialogue and some just interesting episodes.<br />Where I found fault with it, was the foundational pieces.  It felt like, the foundation pieces that were revealed in the second series, were just written (meaning it felt like they didn't write the foundation before they shot the first series).  All the things with Sam and their Dad, were mediocre to me, when it could have been 'Awesome'.  I wanted to be blown away and I wasn't.  They fell way short of the standard that they (producers/writers) established with the story in the first series.  It felt like they didn't bring their 'A Game', more like their B Game or C in some cases, Game.  I was disappointed.<br />Some series seem to explode in the seasons that follow the first (I would say Buffy exploded), while others just peter out.<br />I'm curious to see what they do to the third season, which I might just buy as a 'What not to do' if it's as bad as the second season.

1416562605|3.0|On 14th October 2008, the Booker Committee announced in London that Aravind Adiga will get the Man Booker Prize for his debut novel, `The White Tiger'. The writer, Aravind Adiga claims in an interview:<br /><br />\\"At a time, when India is going through great changes and ,with China, is likely to inherit the world from the West, it is important that writers like me try to highlight the brutal injustices of society\\", he said, adding that the criticism by writers like Flaubert, Balzac & Dickens in the 19th century helped England and France become better societies.1<br /><br />In a single breath, Adiga takes upon his young self, the huge responsibility of highlighting all the `brutal injustices' of India, while feeling proud enough to compare himself with Flaubert, Balzac and Dickens.<br /><br />One should be cautious while making self-comparisons with great personalities. Dickens wrote about London & the English society as it was, with no ideology to guide him. Almost all of his characters from David Copperfield to Oliver Twist have an autobiographical ring.<br />Adiga, on the other hand, is thrice removed from the society and the events he talks about in his book. Born in a metropolitan, Chennai, educated in Australia, the UK, and the US, he has nothing in common with his protagonist, Balram, who is a `low-caste' driver from Bihar. But the un-authenticity of narration doesn't bother Adiga. In fact, he thinks it is quite a duty of a writer to go beyond his own experience; to take a leap beyond reality; to plunge into pure fantasy. He believes in writing by remote-sensing.<br /><br />\\"I don't think a novelist should just write about his own experience. Yes, I am the son of a doctor. Yes, I had a rigorous formal education, but for me the challenge as a novelist is to write about people who aren't anything like me.\\"2<br /><br />Dickens' works are not a judgment on the English society. His worldview evolves in his works. If we put them one over other, chronologically, we can see the intellectual development of Dickens, an observant mind becoming mature.<br /><br />What we see in Adiga is not a natural evolution, but a sudden ideological revelation. He is not trying to learn anything. He knows it all. The ideas are pre-arranged. In the absence of cultural roots he has an ideology to guide him. Secularism. Fantasy and remote-sensing makes up for reality. Worn-out formula-writing makes up for creativity.  Adiga has hitched his wagon to a star. And in Indian heavens, there is only one star. Secularism. It is the Ideology.<br /><br />Flaubert, the other writer Adiga compares himself with, is as distant from him as possible. Madame Bovary is a psychological drama of an individual, and not a statement about the French society, while Salambo is a purely artistic venture of recapturing a remote event of history. If Adiga had read even a single work of Flaubert he wouldn't have compared him with any writer with a social agenda. It appears that Adiga just threw some random names of writers while being interviewed, without probably having read them.<br /><br />Balzac is a different story. Again, Adiga has nothing in common with Balzac in the style and the grasp of the subject matter. Balzac is regarded as one of the founders of realism in European literature. So-called progressive writers in India are fond of comparing themselves with great realistic writers like Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy, Gorky, Dickens, Flaubert, Balzac etc as they think that Indian society is in an eternal need of a Bolshevik style revolution. Taking realism as the most abject form of self-denigration, Indian writers harp on the `social injustices' of India and feel themselves to be in the proud company of great writers.<br /><br />On the level of language too, Adiga falls far too short. The style of narration doesn't match with the projected aim of the book to point out the `brutal injustices' of Indian society. His style takes him nearer to the post-modern writing, while his aimis as ambitious as of a Communist ideologue. For this purpose Adiga inserts some of the most famous secular slogans in Balram's speeches but his style of narration being post-modern is personal and individualistic.<br /><br />Adiga betrays his ignorance of rural Indian society - not that he knows urban India - at many points in the novel. For instance, he asserts that many water buffalos can be bought in seven thousand rupees. Let him purchase just one!3<br /><br />So according to Adiga, the salient features of India are: Every traditional Indian village has a blue-movie (pornographic) theatre.4 No one can enter Indian malls without wearing shoes. Shoes are compulsory.5 No low-caste man can ever enter an Indian mall. Even if he enters stealthily, he is then caught, beaten and publicly humiliated.6 In India, if an owner runs over a man with his car, his driver has to go to jail instead.7 If a servant steals anything, then his entire family, back home, is ritually lynched to death. (their women being repeatedly raped.)8 Every Indian book stall sells `rape magazines'.9 There are separate markets for servants.10 In Indian brothels, they take extra money from servants, called as `Working-class surcharge'.11 Sadhus, are actually homosexual hookers, who get paid to be buggered by foreigners.12 A common Hindu is worse than an Islamic terrorist.13 Indian caste system is worse, or at least as bad as the secret police of a totalitarian state.14<br /><br />The last claim is the central theme of the novel. The caste system of India is called the `Rooster Coop'. Adiga compares the caste system with the secret police of a totalitarian state. This comparison is preposterous. Communism accounted for more than twenty million deaths in USSR, sixty-five million in China, one million in Vietnam, two million in North Korea, two million in Cambodia, one million in Eastern Europe, 1.7 million in Africa, one and a half million in Afghanistan and millions of others.15 And all this in less than seventy years! Does Indian caste system in its history of more than five thousand years, has anything even remotely comparable to equal this record?<br /><br />The only place where he innovates is, in hurting the Hindu religious sentiment. Thus, the polytheism of Hindus is mocked as,<br /><br />\\"How quickly do you think you could kiss 36,000,004 arses?\\"16<br /><br />Balram is called as the `sidekick' of Krishna.17 The hero goes on to murder his employers, who are earlier called as Ram & Sita! Lord Krishna is called as a `chauffeur'.18 About, Kali, the Hindu goddess:<br /><br />\\"...I looked at the magnetic stickers of goddess Kali with her skulls and her long red tongue - I stuck my tongue out at the old witch. I yawned.19<br />Hanuman is called as the slave god of Hindus, an imposition which still makes the low-caste slaves of the upper-caste.\\"<br /><br />\\"Do you know about Hanuman, sir? He was the faithful servant of the god Rama, and we worship him in our temples because he is a shining example of how to serve your masters with absolute fidelity, love and devotion.... These are the kinds of gods they have foisted on us, Mr. Jiabao. Understand, now, how hard it is for a man to win his freedom in India.\\" 20<br /><br />In 1994 Christian missionary, father Augustine Kanjamala of Pune wrote an article in Deccan Chronicle titled, `Replies to Arun Shourie'. In the article he wrote, \\"Harijans worship deities of lower rank, while caste Hindus worship deities of higher rank. For instance, Hanuman is worshipped by Harijans and Rama is worshipped by upper caste in the same village.... Hanuman was the servant of Rama; Harijans are servants of higher caste Hindus. A close affinity between their hierarchy of gods and the hierarchy of society.\\"21<br /><br />Later, indefatigable Arun Shourie had a face-to-face debate with father Kanjamal at Hyderabad. Arun Shourie said, \\"This is insinuation, it is deliberate distortion.... I can assure you that Hanuman Ji is as dear to high caste Hindus, as to low caste Hindu. If after two hundred years of Christianity in India... this is your understanding of India, much needs to be done.... But there is a question... Does the servant and master relationship, high caste and low caste relationship also apply to other Hindu gods? If not, then, how does  your thesis stand? Nandi is ridden by the Shiva. Is it that the low caste people are asked to worship Nandi? And high caste should not worship Nandi? What you have written in your article is a foolish thing to write.\\"22<br /><br />So in 1994, Arun Shourie systematically showed during the face-to-face debate that this insinuation `is a foolish thing to write'. But in 2008, we had another fool repeating the same missionary propaganda, of course recycled as literature this time.<br /><br />Aravind Adiga is in the line of a new breed of writers like Arundhati Roy and Kiran Desai who being Christian or having sympathy with Christianity, share a hatred of Hinduism and Hindu society. It is not a coincidence but a deliberate act of the Booker committee to award all the three. They have ignored really good novels from Pakistan. Why? Because by awarding Pakistani writers, like Mohammed Hanif and Mohsin Hamid, the Left will gain nothing in the bargain. You may call it the Booker Scandal. This is how the alliance of Marxists and the missionaries works against the Hindu society.<br /><br />Writing a novel in India is neither an intellectual nor a spontaneous venture. It is organized on the lines of the formula set by the demands of secularism, seeded during the period of Independence struggle and developed and codified during the Nehruvian era.<br /><br />The literary establishment in India expects from a writer: a complete submission to the Ideology, cramming all its popular slogans and clich&eacute;s; choosing a story and then fit all the `facts' in it; invent facts to patch up the gaping holes; and put in as many features of the formula as possible.<br /><br />A writer is expected to follow the secular formula, which is to show how Hinduism is inferior to other religions; how superstitious and stupid Hindus are; how evil caste-system is; how vile Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas are and how suppressed Shudras are. Show how violent Hindu mythology is, while the very word of Islam means peace. Show that just like Islam and Christianity, Hinduism is also an import in India, having no original claim. Make Hindu history in India as short as possible. At the same time, extend the Christian and Islamic claims on Indian soil as long back in history as possible.23 Throw in some exotic stories of widow burning, caste discrimination, infanticide etc. to pepper this secular curry.<br /><br />Do not, in any case, criticize Islam! Try to extol its virtues, and if not possible just keep mum about its atrocities. Show how they are extremely discriminated in every field such as education and employment.  Also, do not criticize Christianity and their violent conversion activities.<br /><br />Shift the focus of readers from primary problems like the Islamic destruction of India to secondary problems like corruption, poverty, population, unemployment etc.<br /><br />This is the formula which guides every new book and every new writer in India. There is no new voice, no new question, nothing new under the sky. All has been discovered. Every question has been asked, every answer has been given by the Formula, and every problem has been solved by it. What remains to be done is to repeat the secular slogans again and again. For this no tigers are required. Parrots are more than enough for the job.<br /><br />This formula has a history, which is very well portrayed by Dr. Ravi Shanker Kapoor in his book More Equal than Others: A Study of the Indian Left, 2000.24 The literary establishment of India is guided by the leftist intellectuals. All over the world, the Communists have always infiltrated the institutions in order to influence the public opinion. Giving these institutions a neutral veneer, they sell Communist propaganda without letting the masses know the truth behind it. They also fool some intellectuals in furthering their propaganda. So Bengal Friends of the Soviet Union (BFOTSU) was created by the blessings of Rabindranath Tagore.25<br /><br />Most importantly the leftists have infiltrated all the literary, arts and fine arts institutions in India. Thus pro-communist All India Progressive Writers' Association (AIPWA) was formed in which eminent people like Mulk Raj Anand, Munshi Premchand, Sarojini Naidu, Kirshan Chander, KA Abbas, Shivdan Singh Chauhan, Ramananda Chatterjee and Ram Bilas Sharma participated.26 In the field of theater too, the influence of the leftists was predominant. The Indian People's Theater Association (IPTA) is still very influential in India and continues to shape the world-view of the youth.27<br /><br />Novels in India, just like the Bollywood movies are produced according to the guidelines dictated by the establishment. If a new writer follows the secular formula, then his books will be bought by all the schools, colleges, universities and most importantly, all the libraries across the country. For a year or two he will be interviewed by the media, invited to speak on the `problems' of India and their `solutions'. The `intellectual circles' of Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata will throw some parties for them where these writers will fume and fret about the evils of Indian society. Pretty secure career.<br /><br />Dr. Ravi Shanker Kapoor elaborates in another of his book How India's Intellectuals Spread Lies, 200728 that the motive of all this effort is to drill guilt into the hearts and minds of the Hindu majority. So all the ills of Indian society are blamed on Hindus. Adiga too indulges in guilt-mongering against Hindus. The Leftists have been largely successful in their endeavors. Hindus have been defensive.<br /><br />\\"The guilt pervades further, permeating the public debate, infecting the body-politic, dominating the minds and hearts of those who matter... 29 In India, more than half a century of guilt-mongering and other Leftist tricks have created a climate of opinion in which Marxist lies pass of as gospel truth.\\"30<br /><br />This is what Nobel Laureate, V S Naipaul resents when he comments about Indian writing. Commenting on Nirad Chaudhari's intellectual incompetence, Naipaul says:<br /><br />\\"Sixty years after Independence that problem is still there. India has no autonomous intellectual life.31\\"<br /><br />His words ring quite true in the context of Indian writers in general and Adiga in particular. There is no autonomous intellectual life in India. The literary concepts are dictated by the secular establishment.<br /><br />\\"... no national literature has been created like this at such a remove, where the books are published by people outside, judged by people outside, and read to a large extent by people outside.\\"32<br /><br />Yes! No national literature has ever been created in a foreign language. In spite of tall claims and revolutionary agenda, the paradox of Indian English writing remains. The paradox of a literature divorced from its native language. Indian writers rarely speak and never read or write in any of the Indian languages.<br /><br />Most of the Indian writers who have won awards like Booker, no longer live in India or have no connections with the rural India which they claim to write about. They are rootless and hence their works lack authenticity. More the rootlessness, more the arrogance. Thus Arundhati Roy writes about the sexual attraction between zygotic brother and sister; Kiran Desai talks about non-existent `Garwhali Terrorism', but not about the existent Islamic or Naxalite terrorism; and Adiga is worried about the pornographic theatre in Indian villages.<br />Comparing Indian literature with Russian, Naipaul comments:<br /><br />\\"In the nineteenth century, Dostoyevsky and Turgenev and Gogol and Herzenlived for some time outside their native Russia; but they wrote in Russian for Russian readers and (for all of them except Herzen) Russia was where they were published and had their readers. Russia was where their ideas fermented.\\"<br /><br />Nineteenth-century Russian writing created an idea of the Russian character and the Russian soul. There is no equivalent creation, or the beginning of one, in Indian writing. India remains hidden. Indian writers, to speak generally, seem to know only about their own families, and their places of work. It is the Indian way of living and consequently the Indian way of seeing. The rest of the country is taken for granted, and seen superficially, as it was even by the young Nehru...33<br />So true and so fitting on a writer like Adiga. The establishment prefers imitation which is safe over innovation which can be dangerous, ideology over reality, slogans and clich&eacute;s over facts and truth. An ideological world-view makes up for the ignorance of history. A concern for the `brutal injustices' of India, makes up for the lack of creative writing. Of course the `brutal injustices' exclude Islamic terrorism and missionary activities.<br /><br />No writer is recognized by the secular establishment if he doesn't confirm fully to the Formula. The mechanism which keeps the writer on track can be best described by Adiga's own metaphor for the caste-system, the `Rooster Coop'. This Rooster Coop is maintained by the Formula, manned by their faithful `intellectuals'. The Coop is full of parrots who endlessly repeat the secular slogans. Once in a while if a parrot takes courage to break out of the coop and sing a different tune, he is immediately silenced by the intellectual community, Indian media and academia. His name is tarnished, his reputation destroyed, his positions in the Coop, lost. He is made to feel the fault of his heretic ways and finally he is brought back to the fold. Almost all of those who contribute to this mechanism are themselves the captives of the Coop.<br />But as Adiga would have it, the Coop has a mechanism of its own. The parrots imprisoned by this Coop help the Coop to remain intact. If one of their fellow parrot ever tries to do some unparroty acts, then his legs are pulled back by his own mates. Thus no one is ever allowed to leave this Rooster Coop of Secularism. The system goes on. The Coop remains intact. There are ever new parrots in the Coop, but all of them keep parroting the old tune. Adiga is no different.<br /><br />Poverty and corruption are made a fetish in Indian writing, as if they are not secondary problem having some primary cause, but the basic instinct of the Indian civilization. If a writer tries to probe the primary problems then he is immediately labeled as anti-poor, fascist and Hindu fundamentalist. The Coop is so strong that no insider is able to see the truth. Only an outsider like Naipaul is able to perceive the reality and express it courageously. Recognizing India as a wounded civilization he goes back to medieval times to search for the primary problems of India:<br /><br />\\"There is a new kind of coming and going in the world these days. Arabia, lucky again, has spread beyond its deserts. And India is again at the periphery of this new Arabian world, as much as it had been in the eight century, when the new religion of Islam spread in all directions and the Arabs - led, it is said, by a seventeen year-old boy - overran the Indian kingdom of Sind. That was only an episode, the historians say. But Sind is not a part of India today; India has shrunk since that Arab incursion. No civilization was so little equipped to cope with the outside world; no country was so easily raided and plundered, and learned so little from its disasters.\\"34<br /><br />Naipaul goes beyond the immediate and the superficial. He goes beyond poverty, unemployment and other clich&eacute;s and finds the root of the present Indian misery in its Islamic defeat during the middleages.<br /><br />\\"... its [India's] independence has meant more than the going away of the British; that the India to which Independence came was a land of far older defeat; that the purely Indian past died a long time ago.\\"35<br /><br />He thinks it is necessary to go beyond these secondary causes:<br />An inquiry about India, even an inquiry about the Emergency has quickly to go beyond the political. It has to be an inquiry about Indian attitudes: it has to be an inquiry about the civilization itself, as it is.36<br /><br />But these are untouchable subjects in the Rooster Coop of India. With every new addition in the Secular Indian tradition, the writers become even more confident of their worn-out formula.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, Naipaul has this to say about Indian writers:<br /><br />\\"The education of the new Indian writers - and nowadays some of them have even been to writing schools - also gets in the way. It seems to them they have the most enormous choice when, in imitation of the successful people who have gone before, they settle down to do their own book. They are not bursting with a wish to say anything. Nothing is going to force itself out in its own way; they are guided in the main by imitation.... This is where India begins to get lost...\\"37<br /><br />Imitation is the hallmark of Indian formula-writing. Adiga is an imitation of his predecessors like Arundhati Roy, who were an imitation of writers like Mulk Raj Anand & Nirad Chaudhary, who in turn were an imitation of yet others... a tradition of imitation going back to the times of Lord Macaulay. In fact, he inaugurated this tradition in India in his famous note to Lord Bentinck, the then Governor-General of India - Minute of Education on India in February 1835:<br /><br />\\"We must at present do our best to form a class who maybe interpreters between us and the millions whom we govern; the class of persons, Indian in blood and colour, but English in taste, in opinions, in morals and in intellect.\\"38<br /><br />This defines Adiga's intellectual ancestry. In many ways, Adiga's book is not different from `Untouchable' of Mulk Raj Anand, as artificial, as superficial, as far from reality, as incapable of asking questions, as faithful in following the intellectually bankrupt tradition of Secularism.<br /><br />Looking at the ruins of the Hindu kingdom Vijaynagar, at the hands of Muslims, Naipaul reflects over the origin of the current intellectual bankruptcy of India:<br /><br />\\"...I began to wonder about the intellectual depletion that must have come to India with the invasions and conquests of the last thousand years. What happened in Vijaynagar happened, in varying degrees, in other parts of the country. In the north, ruin lies on ruin: Moslem ruin on Hindu ruin... In the history books, in the accounts of wars and conquests and plunder, the intellectual depletion passes unnoticed... India absorbs and outlasts its conquerors, Indians say. But at Vijaynagar, among the pilgrims, I wondered whether intellectually for a thousand years India hadn't always retreated before its conquerors and whether, in its periods of apparent revival, Indian hadn't only been making itself archaic again, intellectually smaller, always vulnerable.<br />The crisis of India is not only political or economic. The larger crisis is of a wounded old civilization that has at last become aware of its inadequacies and is without the intellectual means to move ahead.\\"39<br /><br />The imitation has seeped into the sub-conscious of Indian psyche, and Indians are no longer aware of it. Thus Adiga thinks of himself as pioneer in bringing out the problems of India, but he is just parroting the secular slogans:<br /><br />\\"The middle classes think of themselves still as victims of colonial rule. But there is no point anymore in someone like me thinking of myself as a victim of a colonial oppressor.\\"40<br /><br />Commenting on India's inability to judge, Naipaul says:<br /><br />\\"India has no means of judging. India is hard and materialist. What it knows best about Indian writers and books are their advances and their prizes. There is little discussion about the substance of a book or its literary quality or the point of view of the writer. Much keeps on being said in the Indian press about Indian writing as an aspect of the larger modern Indian success, but literary criticism is still hardly known as an art. The most important judgments of an Indian book continue to be imported.\\"41<br /><br />Nothing else can be more representative of the intellectual bankruptcy of rootless Indian writers, than the fact that they do not even realize it. India is full of parrots, green, red, white, black, brown... but none of them are conscious that they are actually parrots. Some even think that they are tigers...even white tigers!<br /><br />* Pankaj Saksena<br /><br />References<br /><br />1. &lt;a hred=[...]>Adiga's Interview, October 16, 2008&lt;/a><br />2.

And India is again at the periphery of this new Arabian world, as much as it had been in the eight century, when the new religion of Islam spread in all directions and the Arabs - led, it is said, by a seventeen year-old boy - overran the Indian kingdom of Sind. That was only an episode, the historians say. But Sind is not a part of India today; India has shrunk since that Arab incursion. No civilization was so little equipped to cope with the outside world; no country was so easily raided and plundered, and learned so little from its disasters.\\"34    Naipaul goes beyond the immediate and the superficial. He goes beyond poverty, unemployment and other clichés and finds the root of the present Indian misery in its Islamic defeat during the middle ages.    \\"... its [India's] independence has meant more than the going away of the British; that the India to which Independence came was a land of far older defeat; that the purely Indian past died a long time ago.\\"35    He thinks it is necessary to go beyond these secondary causes:  An inquiry about India, even an inquiry about the Emergency has quickly to go beyond the political. It has to be an inquiry about Indian attitudes: it has to be an inquiry about the civilization itself, as it is.36    But these are untouchable subjects in the Rooster Coop of India. With every new addition in the Secular Indian tradition, the writers become even more confident of their worn-out formula.    Not surprisingly, Naipaul has this to say about Indian writers:    \\"The education of the new Indian writers - and nowadays some of them have even been to writing schools - also gets in the way. It seems to them they have the most enormous choice when, in imitation of the successful people who have gone before, they settle down to do their own book. They are not bursting with a wish to say anything. Nothing is going to force itself out in its own way; they are guided in the main by imitation.... This is where India begins to get lost...\\"37    Imitation is the hallmark of Indian formula-writing. Adiga is an imitation of his predecessors like Arundhati Roy, who were an imitation of writers like Mulk Raj Anand & Nirad Chaudhary, who in turn were an imitation of yet others... a tradition of imitation going back to the times of Lord Macaulay. In fact, he inaugurated this tradition in India in his famous note to Lord Bentinck, the then Governor-General of India - Minute of Education on India in February 1835:    \\"We must at present do our best to form a class who maybe interpreters between us and the millions whom we govern; the class of persons, Indian in blood and colour, but English in taste, in opinions, in morals and in intellect.\\"38    This defines Adiga's intellectual ancestry. In many ways, Adiga's book is not different from `Untouchable' of Mulk Raj Anand, as artificial, as superficial, as far from reality, as incapable of asking questions, as faithful in following the intellectually bankrupt tradition of Secularism.    Looking at the ruins of the Hindu kingdom Vijaynagar, at the hands of Muslims, Naipaul reflects over the origin of the current intellectual bankruptcy of India:    \\"...I began to wonder about the intellectual depletion that must have come to India with the invasions and conquests of the last thousand years. What happened in Vijaynagar happened, in varying degrees, in other parts of the country. In the north, ruin lies on ruin: Moslem ruin on Hindu ruin... In the history books, in the accounts of wars and conquests and plunder, the intellectual depletion passes unnoticed... India absorbs and outlasts its conquerors, Indians say. But at Vijaynagar, among the pilgrims, I wondered whether intellectually for a thousand years India hadn't always retreated before its conquerors and whether, in its periods of apparent revival, Indian hadn't only been making itself archaic again, intellectually smaller, always vulnerable.  The crisis of India is not only political or economic. The larger crisis is of a wounded old civilization that has at last become aware of its inadequacies and is without the intellectual means to move ahead.\\"39    The imitation has seeped into the sub-conscious of Indian psyche, and Indians are no longer aware of it. Thus Adiga thinks of himself as pioneer in bringing out the problems of India, but he is just parroting the secular slogans:    \\"The middle classes think of themselves still as victims of colonial rule. But there is no point anymore in someone like me thinking of myself as a victim of a colonial oppressor.\\"40    Commenting on India's inability to judge, Naipaul says:    \\"India has no means of judging. India is hard and materialist. What it knows best about Indian writers and books are their advances and their prizes. There is little discussion about the substance of a book or its literary quality or the point of view of the writer. Much keeps on being said in the Indian press about Indian writing as an aspect of the larger modern Indian success, but literary criticism is still hardly known as an art. The most important judgments of an Indian book continue to be imported.\\"41    Nothing else can be more representative of the intellectual bankruptcy of rootless Indian writers, than the fact that they do not even realize it. India is full of parrots, green, red, white, black, brown... but none of them are conscious that they are actually parrots. Some even think that they are tigers...even white tigers!    * Pankaj Saksena      References    1. <a hred=[...]>Adiga's Interview, October 16, 2008</a>  2. Ibid.  3. Adiga, Aravid. 2008.

B000LF73ZE|5.0|I think this might actually be one of the more perfect books in the world. The prose is effortless and the pacing is appropriately developed. I like the brevity of the \\"scenes\\" and I think the chapter divides work well to tie the narrative together.  It really was outstanding.
0061122416|3.0|The premise and setting sucked me in from Page 1: a young Spanish shepherd roaming the countryside with his sheep, meeting travelers in an unspecified age, presumably around 1000 A.D. The boy has a recurring dream, which he enlists the help of a Gypsy lady to interpret. She says that since it's a child that shows him something in his dream, it must be real. She encourages the boy to set off on a voyage to the pyramids of Egypt where she says he will find an immense treasure. At this point, I was totally engrossed in the story!<br /><br />However, from there, it sort of just drags on. He meets people along the way who have betrayed their own \\"Personal Legends\\" -- their dreams and goals -- in order to settle for comfort. The boy himself settles in as the aid to a crystal merchant in Morocco, and almost decides to give up on his journey before deciding to return to it. Soon after, he meets an Englishman who's also in search of his Personal Legend; and an Arab girl named Fatima who he instantly -- and totally unbelievably -- falls in love with. This was the first point in the story where I said, \\"Oh, come on!\\", but unfortunately, not the last.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil the plot, but for me, the story lost all credibility by the end. I understand this a supposed to be a fantastical tale, but when the boy starts talking to the sun, for example, it's a major departure from the world the author had been created over the first 7/8 of the book, and done with absolutely no set-up. It's like, \\"oh, now he can talk to the sun,\\" with no explanation. Ultimately, there's a big \\"gotcha\\" at the end that reminds me of something from a children's book.<br /><br />Ultimately, I give the first half of the book four stars, the second half two stars. The Alchemist is a short read and would be a good one on an airplane or train, but it's not the modern classic it's made out to be. Its writing it too simplistic, its pacing too erratic, and its tone is too preachy. \\"Just follow your dreams and you'll go far!\\" That's a line from one of my daughter's My Little Pony books and an adequate summary of this book's theme. There's not a lot of \\"there\\" there.That's a line from one of my daughter's My Little Pony books and an adequate summary of this book's theme. There's not a lot of \\"there\\" there.
0765309408|5.0|I just finished reading Old Man's War by John Scalzi. It was fantastic!  I hope that the author would not be offended, or people thinking I am a dumb child, by saying the writing style is great because it is simple.  I hate fluffy details and too many thesaurusized words that send me to my computer for the nth time.   I also was glad that there weren't any egregious scientific problems (at least to someone with as little understanding as I do).  When he started talking about tachyons I got a little worried, but it worked nicely.  Ultimately it was a fun story and a cool universe that has potential for lots of other stories within it.  Next I am either reading Ghost Brigades or Little Brother, whichever comes first in the mail.  9/10
B001IBIQU6|5.0|I became a Depeche Mode fan with Ultra. I start off by admitting that because I am not very familiar with their old catalog of music as I am with their newer one. I loved Playing the Angel--but I LOVE Sounds of the Universe. This is one tremendous cd; the lyrics and the instrumental parts are perfect. You won't be disappointed if you are a fan of DM's later music--or if you listen to the record several times. My favorite songs are \\"Chains,\\" \\"The Truth Is/Miles Away,\\" and \\"Corrupt.\\" But the entire cd is marvelous. \\"Wrong\\" isn't my favorite, but I like it a lot. I'm not sure it's really representative of the sound of the entire record, though, so it seems like an odd choice for a first single to me.
0810979772|5.0|My boy hated reading until we found the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series. He would spend hours reading this book.  He would go to his room and just read.  This is completely amazing coming from a boy that prefers to watch TV and play computer games every chance he gets.  The books are laugh outloud books.  The jokes are above the \\"knock-knock, who's there\\", but completely appropiate for a 8 year old.  Buy the entire series.  Now he asks me when the next book will be published.

B001K3JF7K|1.0|I have been a Diana Krall fan from the beginning and own all her albums.  This will be my last.  I agree with the reviewer who says it has been a downhill slide since her marriage.  She sounds drugged or half-asleep on this album.  I forgave the awful Girl in The Other Room figuring she just wasn't a song writer, but I think she has lost it as a singer, too.   I agree, as several other reviewers noted, that Eliane Elias is the best for bossa nova.
B000002WUD|4.0|94 great songs plus a complete CD of songs taken from different shows live in the 70's. Even if these last songs are great, the mood of a complete Elvis'show is missing.  The remastering is great and the sound is better than ever.  The booklet gives interesting informations on recording sessions and musicians.  Sadly, this is the last opus of a Trilogy. You can prefer the two first. It'not a problem. There is always an Elvis for everyone.
1423101472|5.0|How many times have we seen series start out well, but go out not with a bang but a whimper? Not this series! It started off with a bang and ends with a bang. The Last Olympian is bigger and better. Like J. K. Rowling, Riordan took a whole book to wrap up his series well. If you read the fourth book, [[ASIN:1423101499 The Battle of the Labyrinth (Percy Jackson and the Olympians, Book 4)]], you know what happened to Kronos and what he wants--revenge and the destruction of Olympus. The final showdown is at hand. You will not be disappointed when it happens either. Riordan took his time to let it unfold, battle by battle.    Percy Jackson, your favorite wise-cracking hero, still has that prophecy hanging over his head as his sixteenth birthday approaches. Some people just have to worry about driver's ed. Percy has to worry about the end of the world. In The Last Olympian, Percy faces good, bad, and heartbreaking choices and learns more than he ever wanted to learn about Luke and especially about himself and his destiny. How he learns about Luke reminded me of somewhat of how Harry learned about Voldemort's past. But quicker than you can say Stygian, war is upon him and the other half-bloods. Can they defeat Kronos and his army?    If you're a fan of battles, you'll find plenty in this book and, as always, a plethora of monsters from Greek mythology. And there's Mrs. O'Leary. (Gotta love her.) And if you're keeping track of loose ends, you'll even find out the identity of the last Olympian and why that's important. Riordan always manages to walk the tightrope between humor and pathos. And what about Annabeth and Rachel? At least that saga is wrapped up satisfactorily. Some surprising and not so surprising heroes emerge as the prophecy is fulfilled. I'm sorry to see this series go, but I'm glad it ended well! This is definitely my favorite of the five.    Mr. Riordan, please don't let this be the last Olympian book we read!

B000005DQR|5.0|I remember a friend of me who had bought the album when it came out, and couldn't stop talking about it. Don't really now why, there's so much good music out there, but it took me some time to buy the album myself. Didn't know much about it, listened to it, then didn't listen to it again for quite a while. It didn't really move me, or made a deep impact.  Then I remember taking a bath one night, after working double shifts for a week, putting the CD on and finding myself in another world. The first track that really, really did it for me was stem/long stem, which I found scary at the time, and what a song!!! The guy talking about his traffic offenses, wow, pure genius. And then I was drawn by the album as a whole. It's incredible creative, one of THE proofs that indeed, sampling is music as much as singing or beating the hell out of drums.  I love this album. Just a pity he could never keep this level up, I thought the private press was good but by no means exceptional, and found the outsider an ordinary, generic hiphop album to my regret. But this album is remarkable, and just outright fantastic.
B001AVCFK6|2.0|****Spoiler alert**** ***Spoiler alert**** ***Spoiler alert***  Ok, I know I'm gonna get flamed for this, I don't care.  I watched this movie two nights ago and can not get over how terrible it is.    1.  The REAL Star Trek stories (TOS and TNG) show the enterprise as a exploration vessel that has some decent offensive armaments.  This \\"new\\" old enterprise has some super weapons system that allows it to shoot like 60 phaser bursts a second, allowing it to destroy missile barrages that are launched by the Romulans.    2.  The vessel that comes back from the future is a Romulan mining ship that somehow has the weapons capability to destroy an armada of 40+ Klingon ships.      3.  The Romulans have about as much in common with TNG Romulans as TOS Klingons have to do with Warf.  They looked like humans with weird tattoos.    4.  Spock - What can I say, My favorite part of Spock is the complete absence of emotion.  So they make this Spock someone who controls his temper for so long then snaps and beats the hell out of Kirk. (Yes I understand his whole planet got destroyed and everything)    5.  The Plot.  The Romulans come back to destroy Vulcan and make Spock watch using the same substance that Spock had developed to save Romulus.  Why not just wait and use the substance and save your home planet in 120 years instead of trying to get revenge on the man who tried his best to save your home planet?      There were other tings I hated about his movie as well, but I'm sure this will get me enough evil responses from all the fanboys of the new Star Trek movie.
B00003CXZ4|1.0|I choose to watch this movie, based on the good reviews of this movie in amazon.com.    But this movie is very confusing, like a puzzle, scenes in the movie repeat  back and forth.     It is very hard to understand.     After you come back from a good day of work, you want to relax with a nice movie, and after watching this movie, I feel terrible.    How come so many good reviews of this movie, I don't understand these people.     There is a pain in the butt peron in the office, I am going to recommend and give this movie for her to watch. HAHA

0307387178|5.0|The ideal of living off the land or on the margins of civilization has captivated Americans for years. The thought of living in the woods as a hunter/gatherer has appeal for the adventurer. But even the hardiest mountain men faced trouble, and not all of them survived. Native Americans, who lived in the wild, and survived by hunting/gathering, sometimes died of hunger and the cold. When you're alone on the wilderness, you are.... alone!    Chris McCandless (an ironic name) wanted to live as a traveller, carrying only a pack. He wandered around the USA, first in an old car, then in a canoe, then as a hitchhiker, sleeping rough and working where he could. He ate plants, travelled alone down through abandoned waterways, and did had the kind of adventure most of us only dream of, yet don't do ourselves. We (myself included) would never have the courage.    But Chris wound up dead. Maybe he ate some plants that poisoned him? Maybe he got some kind of tic disease? A parasite from eating wild game? Did he he simply run out of food?     Whatever the cause of his death, let's get one thing clear; Chris (or Alexander Supertramp as he called himself) was brave! He had the guts and the spirit to do what we're all afraid to do. He went out on his own into the wilderness and lived without human help. In our history books, we laud the pioneers who lived on the frontier, miles from civilization and holding their own against the elements. Chris did just that. Had he not died, he'd probably be a best-selling writer by now.
B000K5LBVC|4.0|The extended cut of Gladiator still has many of the problems of the original but doesn't feel as disjointed or quite so disappointing. It's not just that it has more room to breathe, more that the additional footage, particularly the scenes away from Maximus where the future of Rome takes center-stage, raise the stakes beyond the simplistic revenge tale the theatrical version all too often settled for. The climactic fight with Commodus is still a major disappointment not just because it's so underwhelmingly staged but because, unlike The Fall of the Roman Empire, the film it relentlessly plagiarises, Commodus is never a credible threat: where Mann gave him foolhardy courage, Scott has implied he's a coward throughout until even a wounded hero can't even the odds. It's still no Fall, but it is a more satisfying film than the one released in cinemas. Very impressive extra features too.
B001GCUER0|3.0|STYLE OVER SUBSTANCE.  Alright.  Many people say it's a subtle \\"character study\\" and the acting is superb, but even their performances don't make up for the sheer lack of story advancement in this series.  NOTHING HAPPENS.  And that's a shame because the potential is clearly there.  It took me two seasons to even begin to care about these characters.  To be honest, after watching the first season I didn't care if these whiney white folks got hit by a bus, I almost wanted them to because then at least the story would advance.    Critics and college educated audiences latched on to it as \\"intelligent\\" TV in a wasteland of prime time crap, and I admit it, MAD MEN is far better than much stuff out there.  But I think time will prove that this show isn't near the achievement that the critics crow it to be.  It deseves some praises for originality, but as original as it is, this not truley riviting to me as the Sopranos, Six Feet Under, Rome, or Deadwood.  It's a mellowdramatic period soap opera which pretty much floats by on its few strong qualities (ie. acting, style) but aside from some clever dialogue the writers take it nowhere.  Why?  Because really how far can it go?  The show is about New York/5th Aveneue M(Ad) Men and the women who love them all living in a glass house during a pivotal period in America.  The men are \\"mad\\" in the sense that they drink and smoke in their offices - these characters are also intentionally designed not to have any of the political or even moral correctness we think of ourselves as having in the 21st century...I get the charming ironies, duh, but the problem is these charactors can never really go \\"mad\\" at all.  They can never go really do anything interesting because they have to balance the tension of the corperate world and the lusty humanity undernieth that wants freedom.  Draper can never escape for good like he wants to because the series would end.  So where's the danger?  The \\"dangerous\\" situation involving a character's possible suicide in the end of Season 2 is waaaay too contrived.    My point is this show is all about repression and believe me IT GETS OLD.  If the characters can't DO ANYTHING in terms of action on the show, all they can do is whine whine whine.  White house wives whine about their cheating husbands having nervous breakdowns that mysteriously recover from (Mrs Draper from the first season - her hands shake and then we never hear of her condition again???)  I assumed an event that happened in the second season had already happened in the first season.  There's a difference between story telling is charmingly absteract and completely misleading.  And the revelation Donald Draper makes at the end of the first season is way to forced and predictable.  Give me a break and lets see the characters earn their epiphanies.    A bit of a one-trick-poney,  not divine, but a good show  and worth seeing to make your own oppinion.    I hear it is beautiful on blu-ray though, and I believe it.  Beauty was never one of this show's problems.
B001UREJWM|4.0|The Devil You know is just like home cookin'.  There's nothing surprising, shocking or completely mindblowing about it; Everything is familiar--just what you would expect, and just what you want, a brand of metal that few seem to be doing anymore, and few who try can pull off like the guys who actually invented it in the first place.<br />No there's nothing on this album that matches classic tracks like Heaven and Hell or Neon Knights but there's not a clunker to be found in this dark and mostly mid-tempo bunch either.<br />It just feels good dern it!  It gives you that slightly twisted, warm and fuzzy feeling in your gut to know Dio, Iommi, Geezer and Vinny are still out there, still have it, and are every bit as good as ever.

0525421033|5.0|Beautiful story about a 17 year girl who one snowy morning goes on a totally normal car ride with her family that ends in a tragic accident.  Her parents are killed instantly.  Her brother near death.  Mia is injured too, body and brain.  As a spirit, she watches on, tells the story, and must decide to return to her broken body or follow her parents.  Intertwined in the 24 hours it takes her to decide, she recounts her life - her love of the Cello, her punk-rock boyfriend, stead-fast bestfriend, and about-to-be-fulfilled aspirations of getting into Julliard.    Mia is both ordinary and extraordinary at the same time.  The situation is heart wrenching and yet there are moments of totally hilarity (boyfriend and best friend go to extreme and funny lengths to `break into' the ICU to see Mia).  Her boyfriend, aunt, best friend, grandparents, etc. make the story come alive as Mia watches their reactions and recounts their joint histories.    This is not an angsty-teenager book, but rather an essay on where to find meaning in a life.  I loved it!
B000XNNCLI|4.0|Partially reinventing the period movie, stylistically at least, almost as radically as Martin Scorsese reinvented the Biblical epic with his Last Temptation, Shekhur Kapur's account of the insecure early days of Elizabeth I's reign, Elizabeth, is a claustrophobic film set in a dark world of cold grey stone, alternating overhead shots with tight medium shots rather than stressing spectacle or glamour, more political thriller than costume epic. Indeed, with its bloody finale clearly inspired by The Godfather as Walsingham takes care of business for his Capo di tutti Capo, it's almost a mafia movie, with Cate Blanchett's star-making turn as Elizabeth filling in the Michael Corleone role as the heir apparent who must ruthlessly shed emotions and conscience to hold on to the throne. That journey from fresh-faced youth to impregnable white-faced icon gives the film a solid emotional arc that helps prevent it from becoming a simple series of confrontations and thwarted conspiracies, almost - but not quite - turning it into a tragedy of success rather than the usual tragedy of failure that is usually the lot of women in historical pictures (Anne of the Thousand Days, Mary Queen of Scots, Lady Jane, La Reine Margot, etc).     It's handsomely cast: Joseph Fiennes gives good shallow romanticism as Elizabeth's lover Dudley, Christopher Eccleston in his default misery guts mode makes a fine villain and there's a healthy cast that, if not bursting with A-listers, is at least filled with familiar faces, from Richard Attenborough, Fanny Ardant, Daniel Craig and Vincent Cassel in a dress to Edward Hardwicke, Kelly McDonald, James Frain, Emily Mortimer and Eric Cantona. Yet perhaps even more than Blanchett it's a magnificent Geoffrey Rush who often dominates the film from the sidelines as the Queen's loyal and utterly unscrupulous spymaster Sir Francis Walsingham, a man who can seem all things to all men and women but is loyal only to her. Even when he's simply observing from afar he's a powerful presence in all the right ways, emanating a callous intelligence that is truly frightening.     It's strange that the sequel has been attacked by the Vatican as anti-Catholic when this first chapter probably occupies a high place on Ian Paisley's Ten Best List, what with Kathy Burke's psychotic \\"Bloody\\" Mary burning Protestants and threatening to do the same to her half-sister and John Gielgud's Pope (earning fifth billing for barely two minutes' screen time) despatching Daniel Craig's priest to assassinate the Protestant queen not merely with his blessing but his promises of a welcome in heaven for any who help in the task. Not entirely inaccurate considering the many attempts by Catholic kingdoms like France and Spain to topple or assassinate Elizabeth during her reign, but a little more historical context might have been helpful for viewers not so familiar with Tudor politics and the causes and effects of the Reformation. It doesn't help that Michael Hirst's screenplay refers to Marie de Guise (Ardant) as Mary, Queen of Scots, leading some to assume she's THE famous Mary, Queen of Scots rather than her mother, but then the problem of just how much historical information you can include before it gets in the way of the drama is always a difficult one in a period film: too little and you don't know what's happening, too much and you feel like you should be taking notes in case there's a test later. Instead, this is content to follow Elizabeth's rise at the expense not just of her enemies but also some of her early friendships, keeping it personal even as Elizabeth has to shed her own personality to create an icon a divided nation can follow. It's certainly not flawless, but it's never dull and often impressive.
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|As this review of Star Trek posts I will have already seen the film twice...    Family members of mine--who are not fans of the franchise--raved about the movie...    I would call that a successful reboot wouldn't you...?    The film opens with the Federation starship USS Kelvin investigating a mysterious looking Black hole. From its maw appears the Narada, a heavy-armed Romulan vessel, and attacks. The Kelvin's captain, Richard Robau (Faran Tahir) is captured and killed by the Romulan captain Nero (Eric Bana). First officer George Kirk (Chris Hemsworth) takes command and sacrifices himself and the Kelvin in order to allow the rest of the crew to escape. During the escape, George's pregnant wife (Jennifer Morrison) gives birth to a son: James Tiberius Kirk.    Kirk (Chris Pine) as an adult is intelligent but reckless with no direction in his life. He meets Lt. Uhura (Zoe Saldana) and Captain Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood) at a bar in Iowa and is challenged into enlisting in Starfleet.     During his education on Earth, he is suspended for cheating on the Kobayashi Maru test designed by the half-Vulcan, half-human Spock (Zachary Quinto) and not given a starship assignment....    Kirk is smuggled on board the USS Enterprise through by his friend, Dr. Leonard \\"Bones\\" McCoy (Karl Urban), for its maiden voyage as it investigates a distress signal originating from the planet Vulcan: Captain Pike commands, with Spock as his first officer.. En-route, Kirk realizes that the situation is similar to the one 25 years ago when his father died; he convinces Captain Pike that the Enterprise is heading into a trap. When the Enterprise arrives, they find the rest of the rescue fleet destroyed and Nero's ship, using a drilling machine to tunnel to the planet's core. After promoting Spock to acting captain and Kirk to first officer, Pike surrenders to Nero, giving Kirk and Lt. Hikaru Sulu (John Cho) a chance to destroy the drill.    Nero soon decides to set a course for Earth withthe intention of destroying it. Kirk wants to follow Nero immediately, but Spock insists that the Enterprise regroups with the fleet. Spock has Kirk placed on a life pod and sent to the nearby ice planet Delta Vega, where he meets the also stranded Spock Prime (Leonard Nimoy)...    Director .J. Abrams, and writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman make sure this voyage pops with enough action, eye-popping FX, emotional resonance, and reverence to the franchise to make Trekkers beam with glee--As I indicated at the top--Non fans can and will enjoy the film as well.    To those fans who grumbled about changes to established Trek lore fret no more--the film does a fine job explaining it all--including Spock showing lots of emotion without giving everyone else a headache--Debate about alternate time lines and choices made by the filmmakers was gonna happen no matter what--\\"Star Trek\\" TOS V.2.O is here to stay (at least for 2 more films)    The film is, at its center, an exploration of the Kirk/Spock dynamic--\\"I have been and always shall be your friend\\" and the like..which is even given more weight with the presence of Nimoy.    Casting and chemistry (behind the scenes squabbles not withstanding) has always been strong on Trek and here is no exception...    For me, Pine is the true revelation of the flick as Kirk--and a star is born--Kirk as played by Shatner had plenty of bravado...Check....Made time with ladies...Check..and radiated confidence and authority...Check. Pine had all of that even giving a nod to The Shat at times without doing just an impression. it was more of a subtlety kind of thing...(The Maru Test scene)    The scene in Sick Bay is priceless...    Urban as McCoy is also just great...Somewhere DeForest Kelley is smiling--Quinto as the younger Spock is dandy too...As Uhura Saldana is given much more to do here then in most other episodes or films and thus the character is fully formed...Bana is fine as the villian but screen time is lacking therefore Nerois no Khan--Most of his important stuff happens before the film...As for Nimoy, he is Spock and clearly enjoyed himself...Good to see you old friend...    The supporting characters Cho as Sulu Simon Pegg as Montgomery \\"Scotty\\" Scott., Anton Yelchin as Pavel Chekov Greenwod as Pike were all given chances to shine here....The beloved characters are in good hands...    Quibbles are very minor (What I said about Nero) Trek is back big time--The film does what every franchise pic should do leave audiences wanting more...A must see! Indeed...    The Human Adventure Is Just Beginning...

B000ZOXDFA|3.0|At once more ambitious and less intriguing than its predecessor, Elizabeth: The Golden Age certainly isn't the abject disaster reviewers claimed on its theatrical release, although it's not nearly as engrossing as the original. Unfortunately, while Shekhar Kapur opens up the action and opts for a much lighter palate this time round, with at least a trailer's worth of striking visuals, the results are not particularly compelling. By focusing on the best-known part of the Virgin Queen's reign there's less of the constant sense of danger that marked its predecessor even though it amps up the threat by pitting her not against her own court but the might of the Spanish Empire and its Armada. Yet, being a sequel, it adheres to the `the same but different,' and there's certainly a strong element of déjà vu: the dastardly Catholics are still plotting her death, with Rhys Ifans and Samantha Morton taking on the Daniel Craig and Fanny Ardant roles of Jesuit hitman and conspiring Scottish queen. And, as before, history isn't well served, with the film offering the notion that Philip of Spain conspired to force Elizabeth to execute Mary Queen of Scots to give him an excuse for a holy war.     The script certainly could have been better, running down rather than gaining momentum as the Armada approaches and dropping the ball in many of the obvious slamdunks. Certainly if you're going to omit Elizabeth's famous \\"I may have the body of a weak and foolish woman, but I have the heart of a king\\" you need to come up with something with more guts and bravado than the tired horseback speech she gives to rally her troops. Even worse, the Armada itself is something of an anti-climax. The almost painting-like CGi effects aren't as much a problem in a film as occasionally stylised as this as are the all-too obvious budget limitations that reduce it to the odd running commentary that makes it somewhat akin to listening to a football game on the radio.     Performances are highly variable.Blanchett is suitably regal in the lead, with Geoffrey Rush and David Threlfall fare best among the courtiers, but Abbie Cornish makes little impression, Rhys Ifans just seems to be going through the motions and Samantha Morton is fairly awful as Mary. Both bland and risibly hammy at the same time, with her risibly overemphatic delivery she feels like a smug prefect in a school play playing up to the gallery rather than a credible conspiring monarch, giving easily the worst performance in the film even after the worst of her performance hit the cutting room floor. Yet the biggest surprise in the film is Clive Owen's Walter Raleigh.     If at first it seems disastrous casting the zombie-like Owen as the representation of the life and love Elizabeth can never have, but, amazingly, for once he almost rises to the occasion. Like many a bad actor he's utterly hopeless in the moments that aren't about him, looking bored when he's supposed to be listening, displaying complete disinterest in his scenes with Abbie Cornish and sleepwalking through the battle with the Armada, but for once he handles his monologues - the best writing in the film - surprisingly well, even changing his expression a few times, though quite why he chooses to play his early scenes with a bad American accent remains a mystery. It's not a perfect performance (the deleted scenes on the DVD show that his flat delivery and lack of timing botched a gift of a scene with Rush), but for the first time there are signs that if he was willing to really put in the work and had a director who wouldn't mistake talking in a bored Coventry accent for a performance he could be a capable jobbing supporting actor.     The 1.85:1 widescreen transfer is a bit disappointingly short on detail in some scenes, though there are a decent set of extras.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|There are so many negative reviews on here. I haven't read a book in a very long time, always because \\"I don't have time!\\" I made the time after my daughters talked me into watching the movie. I thought the movie was lame at first but watched again and then succumbed to reading the series. I thoroughly enjoyed each one but came to dislike Jacob and somewhat dislike Bella for loving him. I was \\"team Edward.\\"  I think people expect too much out of writers. This is fiction, use your imagination and just enjoy the reading. If you can do it better, GO FOR IT!
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the premise of this movie which plays with paranormal time travel and changing reality. Jemima Rooper as Amanda has very funny lines and predicaments that she lands in that were extremely funny and from which she has to extricate herself with wit and hilarious results. She commands an excellent portrayal of her lovable character with candid comedic facial expressions that did me in. One must listen carefully to her 21st century mind trying to download into 19th century England. I loved the dialogue and particularly enjoyed Mr. Bennet's exasperated demeanor and humorous anecdotes about his life. All in all, the actors are all wonderful, and you will love Jemima Rooper's character. The movie is in keeping with the Austen themes of romantic characters with only romance on their minds.
B001PU8N0I|4.0|This is a wonderful production.  The actors were marvelous-- especially those playing Amy, her father and Arthur Clenham.  Little Dorrit is a story of how people deal with poverty such as Amy's being born and growing up in a debtor's prison. Also, there are her father's difficulties in finding self esteem and acceptance even when he is freed from the prison and has to struggle to gain acceptance in a society in which status is considered of prime importance.  Amy's compassion for her father is shown with great sensitivity-- especially when she comforts him when he feels he is a failure because he is in prison and has lost his former life of wealth and success.  And there is that moving moment near the end of the story when Amy and Arthur Clenham realize that they have a fortune in their love relationship even though it looks as if their money is all gone. This miniseries is so good that seeing it makes you want to read the book.    The only drawback with this set is the case that was provided.  The four DVD's would not snap back in the case after I played them because the hubs wouldn't hold the discs in place. I am storing mine in Memorex Twin Cases instead of the one which came with the set in order to prevent the DVD's from being dislodged. The DVD's have quite good sound and picture quality and viewing them is a pleasurable experience. But considering the price of the set and its contents, it seems that it could have been offered with much better packaging.

B001WCN23W|5.0|1st off I want to say Virgin did an excellent job in 1994 and they held up very well in relation to other artists issued CDS since that time.  However, with the reissues there's an enhancement sonically...the drums and bass are alive sounding and for my ears i hear alot of the unique or the lower guitar sounds mixed out or down (obviously the brown sugar riff is loud as ever), but i'm talking more about the Brian Taylor CDs who had more licks than Woods would play and i'm sure Woods plays more basic guitar and Taylor is way more intricate.  Having said that which do you choose i'd say begrudgingly the new 2009 remasters but don't think the virgin 1994 were these old disgusting muddy versions which overall were not that...but again sonically the drum and bass are really alive and sound alot better so you'll love the new remasters in that respect also i've yet to hear any distortion everything is just a bit clearer as well...however in sticky fingers in particualar i heard some mixing out and down from the 1994 version which can be a very slight loss...but i also like the 2009 remaster due to what to the sonic upgrades but i really don't like it when people dismiss the 1994 virgin as old trash.

0156030209|3.0|Life of Pi is in my opinion a six out of ten. The novel is unique and well written, but at the same time the author can wander from the plot. The actual shipwreck doesn't occur until a quarter into the book (the book is 400 pages long). The novel overall is a decent. The mental plot behind it is very intriguing; Pi's thought process and opinions on thing can really make you think! Life of Pi also gives you a good insight in on different religions ,and gives you a new way to look at them.         So overall I recommend Life of Pi to people who are good readers and do not have short attention spans because the book can be boring at times. Pi is a great character whom we can all relate to. I also recommend it to children over 13 because it can be hard to understand, and enjoy Life of Pi!
B001P9KR8U|4.0|Although desperately poor, Jamal has something most of us don't.  He knows exactly what and who he wants.  Of course, it doesn't hurt that Latika is adorable as a child and breathtakingly beautiful as an adult but this just the way Hollywood used to do it.  The plot may be the oldest in the world but the use of the Millionaire show makes it fresh.<br /><br />On top of this, the movie is extraordinarily well put together.  An entire story, told in flashbacks yet not at all confusing.  Perfectly paced too, with the suspense building to that final cell phone call.<br /><br />Was it the best movie of the year? Not really.  But perhaps, just as the stars aligned for Jamal, audiences were ready for a break from the mostly vulgar chick flicks, prequels, comic books and Armageddon that Hollywood shovels at us.<br /><br />I'd almost go for 5 stars but for one misstep.  Everyone I talk to remarks about the children being tortured.  Of course one can't overcome evil if there is no evil, but this is not the thing people should take away from this uplifting film.

B001FB55MG|3.0|I must admit thinking of an Adam Sandler film that wasn't laced with crude humor didn't seem like a good idea, but the film is pretty entertaining for kids and adults alike. I wasn't a big fan of Eddie Murphy's 'Dr. Doolittle' series or 'Daddy Day Care' for that matter, because I felt the films were just too silly and aimed to keep the kiddies' happy.<br /><br />In 'Bedtime Stories', Sandler finds a pretty good mix to keep kids happy, but also to keep adults interested. For me, the funniest moments come from the many cameo's from Sandler's buddies, who turn up in everyone of his films.<br /><br />It's a harmless film with a little romance, fantasy and of course comedy!

B001GQSY5K|5.0|Yes.  I know what you're thinking.  \\"Better than the originals?\\"  But know this, I can recite the dialog of the first three (IV, V & VI) movies released and I am a true fan warrior.  However, I was deeply impressed by this Star Wars: The Clone Wars computer animated movie.  The story line was really good and the voice-overs \\"clone\\" the originals, with the exception of some new characters.  Overall, if you like Star Wars at all, you'll love this movie.
B000FL7CAK|4.0|Darker than the first season and less satisfying in its resolution, the second season of \\"Veronica Mars\\" is, nevertheless, still likely to please fans of the series. The over-arching mystery of this season centres around a bus accident that results in the deaths of a number of Neptune High students, but other mysteries that Veronica must solve include the murder of one of Weavil's friends, possibly by Logan, and the molestation of a group of young men when they were boys. We also get to see the outcome of the events of Season one, including the trial of Aaron Echolls.    Child abuse and molestation are the main themes in this season of \\"Veronica Mars\\", and the makers of the show deal with them reasonably well, although they didn't quite manage to make the ultimate consequences of the molestation/abuse believable to me. Whereas in Season One, it seemed believable that Aaron Echolls could be a murderer, I just didn't believe in the ultimate reveal of this season. It's not to say that the makers of the series didn't try. As in the first season, by the final episode it is clear that clues to the killer had been laid right from the beginning, and I appreciate that, but it just didn't quite work.    Having said that, I still enjoyed Season Two of \\"Veronica Mars\\" very much. It is still one of the smartest teen shows ever made and I thoroughly enjoyed every episode. Hopefully other fans of the series will feel the same.

B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|I love the Star Trek franchise so much I want to see a new Star Trek series! A lot of fan hopes are riding on this film! The reason for a five star review! To drive this point home - I actually stopped watching television programing completely once Enterprise (the last Star Trek series) went off the air about 5 years ago! And, I have literally watched every TV episode (and film) of every Star Trek series, in real time, since its inception in 1966! I also collect rare vintage Star Trek memorabilia, have heard Leonard Nimoy, and many others involved with Star Trek, speak at various Science Fiction Conventions from the early 1970's to the present, and I subscribe to a Star Trek fanzine, \\"Trexperts,\\" edited by a one dedicated Star Trek fan, which is still mailed all over the world! Needless to say, the Star Trek universe has had a huge impact on my life!<br /><br />I sincerely hope someone from Hollywood reads this review! In the long run (and that's what Star Trek is all about) you're not going to win new fans by dumbing-down Star Trek Into a comic book story solely to satisfy the fickle teen market! I realize a lot of the previous 11 Star Trek movies have been box office flops (and for good reason!) because IT'S ABOUT THE STORY, STUPID! Sure the special-effects-eye-candy is spectacular, the cinematography does not disappoint and the design of the sets are absolutely amazing! The acting ranged from perfect (the New Captain Kirk & Leonard McCoy) to sufficient (the new and original Mr. Spock). And, all the supporting cast certainly held their own! But the story was so unimaginative and preposterous, it came across as nothing more than contrived cardboard drivel.<br /><br />It kind of boggles the mind! There are absolutely an endless number of Science Fiction themes that run through all the various Star Trek episodes. What more do you want? You have about 26 YEARS worth of episode ideas to choose from! Then there are plenty of ideas Star Trek has not explored which is summarized in a single 900+ pages book covering most Science Fiction ever written in any language in the world:[[ASIN:1591581710 Anatomy of Wonder: A Critical Guide to Science Fiction Fifth Edition]]. It doesn't take a rocket scientist (pun intended) to do the research to come up with new and wonderful ideas! But no! The Spineless Chickens at Paramount had to make a film with as much delight and imagination as the last Star Trek movie dud! What an incredible insult to all the Star Trek fans that have spent their time and money supporting Star Trek over the years by watching only God knows how many vapid TV commercials or spending their money on film tickets, videos, DVD sets, books & fan magazines, convention tickets and Star Trek memorabilia!<br /><br />Ironically, just two days a ago I rushed out to see the brilliant science fiction animated film, [[ASIN:B0021L8ULW Battle for Terra [Blu-ray]]], before it was yanked out of the theater to make room for \\"Star Trek.\\" It's hard to believe, but it was showing on a mere single screen in a metropolitan area with about 1.5 million people! Despite the magnificent animation, storyline, and acting - staring both Danny Glover and James Garner (of all people!), it was a miserable flop at the box office. Why?

B0001L3LUE|5.0|This is the most entertaining, inexpensive and painless history lesson you'll ever get on the 20th Century. It's also Errol Morris's best documentary, in my opinion. True, the Thin Blue Line is terrific but I think this is his best. If you wish you were smarter you might want to wish again. This is the story of Robert McNamara: the brightest and the best of his or any age who found himself villified beyond what was reasonable or deserving. Still, he calmly made no excuses while talking candidly about doing what needed to be done. \\"We killed fifty-thousand men, women and children in one night over Tokyo,\\" he said with a straight face. This is a great film and as close a look at one of the men who lived in the midst of the greatest focal points of the century you'll ever see.

1575666286|5.0|What's not to understand.  Why cure cancer completely??  Or for that matter all ill fated illnesses?  Please take a moment and realize the money involved in just so called \\"managing\\" illnesses.  Companies that make medical equipment, special food products for various illnesses, doctors pressured to meet their patient quota, hospital responsibility to their institutions and their employees.  Doctors despensing drugs because that is all they can do to keep their jobs, or seek alternaive medicine practice.  Do you really think anyone but your family members really cares whether you live or die because of radiation or chemotherpy?  The hard fact is that YOU ARE nothing but a resource for them via your insurance company - The hard fact is that they will never cure cancer completely or any serious illness - They need you to be sick, or else they don't have a industry.  Yes some do get results and get better -  but they have such a long way to go - and they will take their sweet money making time doing so.  Diatebes association is a very lucrative business now - When I called and asked what they are doing in terms of research and curing - she was speechless - yes she did not know how to answer.

B001FB4W0W|3.0|Ok, I enjoyed the books.  The TV series doesn't have the feel of the books or stay true to the plot or even the characters. That's OK, it's TV.  At first I had trouble with the casting.  None of the cast seem to fit the characters in the book... So just accept this is LOOSELY based on the book.  I wouldn't buy this season unless it was dirt cheap.  You can go online and search/view all the episodes.  Watch thru to the ending episode... by that time, you get used to the characters and that is the episode that gives you hope that season two is actually going to be worthwhile....So, if you can actually get through the first 12 episodes.... things might get better.... also go online and see the preview for season two... it looks promising..

B001PA0FFO|5.0|Religion is built on faith. By definition, it must be, for it cannot prove its claims and most of what we know about science refutes most of what's said by religion.    It is using faith that Sister Alloyicious (Meryl Streep), bases her entire case against a charasmatic new priest (Phillip Seymour Hoffman). He's the embodiment of Vatican 2, and she's... well, probably Mel Gibson's grandmother.    The priest is doing things like giving sermons in English, that talk about peace, compassion and tolerace. He's taking sugar in his tea. He's even using a ballpoint pen! His ideas and his way of doing things are vastly different from those of the good Sister, so she's willing to believe, on the slightest, flimsiest theory, that the priest is molesting one of the boys in his care.    It's fascinating to watch as she builds up this case in her own mind, eager to believe it is true. She talks with the priest, with the boy's mother (who is, btw, one of the most pragmatic characters I've ever seen on screen), with another nun, with just about everyone, and though everyone defends the priest against her, she refuses to listen, cause she has certainty. She has faith. She has no doubt.    The character studies here are fascinating, as are the contrasts in this very important time of the Church's life, as is the rush to judgement and the power of rumor. Merely by raising the suspicion in people's minds that this priest may be molesting a child, she makes it real, no matter if it is or isn't.    This is a very good movie and one I'd highly recommend. See what can happen when faith takes the place of rational thought.
B0012X6FR6|5.0|The Bill Evans Trio with Scott LaFaro and Paul Motian is arguably the greatest jazz three-piece of all time.  Unfortunately, Scott LaFaro's tragic death left only a handful of recordings to cherish.  Recently, we have been lucky enough to get a few more morsels to savour -- an eye-opening extra take of \\"Gloria's Step\\" on the recently remastered [[ASIN:B000AMJEKA The Complete Village Vanguard Recordings, 1961]], and even the historical document (the sound is too poor to call it an \\"album\\"), [[ASIN:B0009X5ILO The 1960 Birdland Sessions]].  When I recently discovered that the remastered \\"Keepnews Collection\\" edition of \\"Portrait in Jazz\\" contained two additional bonus tracks -- an alternate take of \\"Come Rain or Come Shine\\" and a first take of \\"Blue in Green\\" -- not featured on the original OJC issue, I simply had to replace my disc.  The telepathic musical communication so easily achieved at the Vanguard is just beginning to form here, but the alternates are a wonderful way to witness its development.  With the 50th anniversary of this album approaching on December 28th, enjoy this expanded \\"Portrait\\" of legendary jazz.
B001AVEJ1Y|4.0|I am not a hardcore Trekkie. I used to be, back in the day. I've seen every episode of the original series, The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine and Voyager and tolerated most every episode of Enterprise before I lost interest. I own a few of the DVDs, including all the good movies, and I do watch them from time-to-time. But I'm not obessed, like I used to be. I no longer own any of the novels, for example, and can't remember the last time I attended a Trek-specific convention.    But I do still enjoy the show. Like I said, I have some of the episodes on DVD as well as the good movies, and I have a few episodes downloaded onto my 360. I mention all of this so that you know where I am coming from in my review of this, the 11th film in the series. Sort of.    For all the continuity whores out there, let's get this out of the way now: this is not the same universe as the regular Trek reality. It's made very clear about halfway into the film that since the opening credits we've been in an alternate reality. If you, like me, start wondering why the Farragut is launching without Kirk on board, don't worry; it just happened differently in this reality. Same with certain larger events that clearly never happened in the continuity that we're used to. If you're a hardcore fan of the series, keep this in mind and you'll be ok.    For the rest of you, yeah, you'll have a good time, I think. There's plenty of action and a feeling quite different from any of the other movies or TV shows in the series. The acting by everyone is top-notch, particlarly Zachary (Spock) Quinto and Karl (McCoy) Urban. The plot is at times a little iffy (centering around this movies Khan wanna-be as he sets out for revenge against Spock), but that's ok. It accomplishes what it set out to do, and that's good enough.    This is a far from perfect movie. It features way too much action and not nearly enough of the emotional and scientific core that made Trek such a great program. The villain isn't much ofmuch, and most of the lower-tier characters don't really have a lot to do. There's also a very unnecessary romance between a couple of the characters that I did not care for.    But that said, there's a lot in this movie to enjoy. Rather like Doctor Who and Battlestar Galactica, they've kept a lot of what works and, if nothing else it does do a great job of getting all the pieces on the board for the next film in the series, meaning that the franchise shall, once again, live long and... oh, I just can't bring myself to type that. Just enjoy the movie.
B001GCUO1G|4.0|I just saw the movie last night and despite some nit-picky quibbles about some of the events in the movie, thought it was excellent.    Gambit was introduced in this film and was perfectly cast, loved the sequence he was in.    It didn't have a huge deep plot and lots of angst ridden speeches, but it was a summer blockbuster the way summer blockbusters should be, you know lots of action and a rollicking pace. I enjoyed it.

B001UREJWM|4.0|Back when I first heard the album \\"Heaven and Hell\\" from Black Sabbath (Mark II) in 1980, I would have never expected the same lineup (sans Bill Ward for Vinnie Appice) to be putting out new music in 2009. How cool is that? Like most Sabbath albums, it takes a few listens to really appreciate. First listen I was under-impressed as all the songs sounded too similar. However, after 3-4 listens, the subtleties and differences started to really come through. Overall a very solid and impressive effort, and worth a purchase.
B001GM28HO|3.0|\\"Fame\\" starts out with some really dance-heavy, sure fire hits; \\"Love Game\\", \\"Papparrazi\\", \\"Just Dance\\" and of course my all-time favorite, \\"Pokerface\\". After that, the album falls flat with mostly slow and uninspired songs that go in every direction, but fun. There really aren't any more catchy hooks, beats or any unique lyrics after around track 6. Theres a really lame bluesey song and a few pop songs that sound like recycled garbage from all the one hit wonders of yesteryear. I recommend burning off the songs that are to your liking and selling the cd. Either that, or just downloading the first 5 or 6 tracks off itunes or amazon.

0307408833|5.0|I first used Erin's recipes after watching a video of her on the Food Network website. I tried the recipes for Double Chocolate Chip Cookies and Blueberry Muffins. I have been using them ever since. I was so happy when I learned that she was publishing a cookbook!<br /><br />My husband has Celiac Disease. My oldest son has the gene for CD and he has anaphylactic reactions to eggs. My youngest son's CD test was inconclusive. So, we are an egg-free, gluten-free family. It is just easier to cook things that we ALL can eat. The problem is that many GF recipes call for MORE eggs than the wheat-version. I've tried egg replacer, flax meal, applesauce etc. Some recipes can be converted, some are just a lost cause.<br /><br />Erin's recipes work. I don't have to do anything special. They just work. I had my misgivings. I do not care for garfava flour. It is ok in bread, but in dessert? I read through the cookbook with trepidation. Should I use my own GF mix or trust the recipe?I will share my baking experience below.<br /><br />First, I want to make a couple of comments on the cookbook. It is quite lovely. It is like a coffee table book. The pictures are nice. The writing is upbeat and fun. I like that almost all of the recipes have a picture. This book will lie flat on the counter. Although, I am nervous that I will spill something on it. Maybe it is a little too pretty. She does a pretty good job of describing the tools and flours. I would recommend a couple of things here though. 1. Explain the difference between potato starch and potato flour, or at least mention that there is a difference. 2. Tell us what kind of coconut oil to use. Extra-virgin? Refined? Is there a difference? I bet most of us are new to using coconut oil and could use some guidance here.<br /><br />Another reviewer felt that it was implied that these recipes are healthy, when they are not. I would say that the claim is that these recipes are healthier, but not necessarily healthy. We are talking about desserts! Garfava flour has more protein, fiber and maybe iron, than wheat flours and rice flours. Coconut oil and agave nectar may be healthier than butter and sugar. I don't know and I don't care. I am making yummy desserts that work. I expect my dessert to be loaded with fat and sugar, no matter what form the fat and sugar take.<br /><br />I agree with the reviewer that said the title is misleading. I thought that all of the recipes in this book would be gluten-free. I guess \\"vegan, (mostly) gluten-free, (mostly) sugar-free\\" makes for an unwieldy subtitle. There are a lot of GF recipes though. Everything I am interested in, except the biscuits, is GF. I am sure I will get around to trying to modify the biscuits so that they are GF as well. The cupcakes (except red velvet), cakes (except one), frostings, most of the muffins, cornbread, banana bread, gingerbread, brownies, blondies and drinks are all gluten-free. The pie crust, scones, biscuits, a couple of muffins and a couple of cakes/cupcakes are not. Even so, I have no regrets about buying this cookbook.<br /><br />Here are the recipes I have made so far.<br /><br />Blueberry Muffins:<br />The recipe in the book uses spelt flour, so I did not try that one. I have been using Erin's GF Blueberry Muffin recipe that I found on Food Network.com a few months ago. It is great! I use about the half the cinnamon she calls for, but otherwise I make them according to the recipe.<br /><br />Double Chocolate Chip Cookies:<br />Again, I am using the recipe that was posted on Food Network.com. I think it is the same as the one in the book. When I started using this recipe, I was not willing to buy the coconut oil, so I have been using butter. (We are not vegan, my son has an egg allergy.) This works really well with butter, if you don't have a problem with that. Now that I have the coconut oil, I will probably try these using that. I do use a little less flax meal than the recipe calls for.<br /><br />Brownies:<br />I made these using garfava flour. The batter tastes gross. You can taste the garbanzo. However, the brownies themselves are excellent. They are moist and very chocolatey. She recommends making them in mini-muffin pans. I don't have those, so I used my 8x8 baking pan. It took about 30 minutes longer to cook them in that pan. The brownies are very rich. They taste great warm or cold. I do think I can detect a slight hint of garfava flavor in the brownies, but that could be my imagination. Even so, they are very, very good.<br /><br />Lemon-Poppy Teacake:<br />I did not follow the recipe for this. I was nervous about using Bob's all-purpose flour since it contains garbanzo and fava beans. (I hadn't tasted the brownies yet!) So, I used a GF mix I make based on a recipe at glutenfreegoddess.com. The teacake turned out pretty well, but the lemon flavor was very strong. This is probably because my flour does not have the strong flavor of Bob's. Also, there are a lot of poppy seeds in this teacake! I will definitely use less next time. Overall, it is a good teacake.<br /><br />Cupcakes:<br />I made the vanilla and the chocolate. I halved the recipes so that I wouldn't end up with a ton of them. These are probably the best eggless GF cupcakes I have ever had. I do think I can taste the garfava flour in the chocolate ones, but it is not overwhelming. They are still great cupcakes. They have a good structure without being too moist or too dry. We haven't even frosted them yet. We are eating them plain and loving them.<br /><br />Vanilla Frosting/Sauce:<br />I couldn't find powdered soy milk, so I used powdered cow's milk. The frosting is pretty good, but you can really taste the coconut. I am using extra-virgin coconut oil, so maybe a more refined oil would have less flavor. I don't know. This frosting is liquid at room temperature, so I don't see myself giving up the buttercream altogether. I do like the flavor though! I haven't used it to frost the cupcakes yet. I have it in the fridge, waiting for it to solidify. I can see myself using this for certain things, but not everything.<br /><br />I really like the cookbook so far. None of the recipes have been duds. Once you have all the ingredients, the recipes are pretty simple to follow. I am glad that I bought it!However, the brownies themselves are excellent.

0930289234|5.0|Alan Moore a great writer making epic things like WATCHMEN and V for VENDETTA, for me the best graphic novel ever. Also a masterpiece, it involves a lot of modern and old things, everyone should read it
0312360266|1.0|I started this book and after the first chapter I felt like I was walking down the hall in a high school (Yes I realize this is who it is geared for).      I felt like Harry Potter meets Twilight except an uneducated version of it ALL.  Vampire Finishing School is a great idea (Kind of like Wizarding school) I thought it lacked substance in this general area.  I felt like instead of educated, classy, eloquent vampires (as in Twilight) these were trailer trash vampires who were idiots (no offence intended).   I also felt like some of the concepts were Twilight rip-offs such as the \\"imprinting\\".      I also felt like for this series to be geared to teenagers the language is not inspiring in a positive way.  Books like this give off a sense of what is acceptable and sometimes tend to inspire teens to say certain things or act certain ways and I don't think the themes in this book are good ways to inspire. Foul language, sexuality, drug and alcohol use, and the turning of a blind eye by the adults (that is why most teens in America have no self control because adults turn blind eyes on the wrong they do)  At least in Twilight the vampires are educated, and well versed in manners and music appreciation and for the most part have a respect for those they are involved with.     I don't think these are appropriate for most teens.  For teens who have parents who are open and communicate regularly with them it may be okay but not for most whose parents don't talk about issues with them.

B001EN71HC|3.0|As a fan of Austin Powers a have been waiting for a BD Edition for log time. However, when I finally got it I felt  quite disappointed of picture quality.  I had read review that the two first movies are awesome and the Gold member is not as sharp. IMoM and TSWSM have a huge grain so it's disturb me all the time . My kids and wife said is no way that is blu ray. I saw this movie on TNT year ago and have to say that looked awesome so I thought the blu ray edition will compare in quality, so sadly,  I was wrong.  If you are really fan of AP you can buy it, if you already own the DVD edition rather wait for better transfer for BD.

B001AVCFK6|5.0|I have got to say that I am a fan of anything Trek and that I was concerned with this remake. Would it ruin everything else for me? Not at all. New cast, new story -- yet, everything old and familiar. It gives the franchise a new lease -- will there be more sequels, and perhaps a new TV show? Let's hope so! This movie stands by everything Star Trek -- the character's we love, the twists of a great story, and you can't help but try to put yourself in the bridge and be part of the crew... can't wait to own this on Blu-ray.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought this dvd because I have Jillian's two other dvds, No More Trouble Zones, and Boost Your Metabolism.  Although I love those, I wanted to try this one because it's only about 30 minutes total.  And I'm the type of person, I want to just get it over with as soon as I can!  By no means expect this dvd to be easier because it's shorter.  If anything, it's harder and more intense.  I am definitely a beginner.  I have always hated exercise, but finally decided I needed to get in gear.  I chose Jillian Michael's dvds because I figured she wouldn't be one of those airheady workout people who smile the entire time they're working out.  That type of thing really annoys me, so I figured Jillian would be more my style.  I love her! I know she has her \\"bully\\" reputation, but she is really very motivating.     I'm on day 5 of Level Two of this dvd.  I didn't measure myself before doing Level One, so I don't know how many inches I might have lost doing it, but I have lost an inch so far doing Level 2 and it's only been 5 days.  This workout is super intense, but like I said I'm a total beginner, so I think it would be okay for almost anyone.  If you have knee problems though, then be careful and don't over extend your knee.  I actually did that while doing one of her other dvds and my knee was sore for a week.  But it was my own fault for not doing the move right.  When she says not to bring the knee out in front of the foot, listen!! Or you'll end up like me with a knee pain for a week.     I haven't really lost a lot of pounds, but I think I have gained muscle. Out of the blue one day my husband pointed to my arm and said, \\"Hey a muscle!\\"  Which is a big deal, because believe me, I have never had anything close to a muscle in my life.     I would definitely recommend this dvd.  I love it even though it kicks my butt and I'm dripping with sweat at the end! Definitely worth it!
B001C4CI8U|5.0|I've watched several of the new series, and I would have to say that Fringe really is \\"must see TV\\". Is it X-file-ish? mildly, however it bases its episodes on what is called Fringe Science, not mainstream usual science but rather what might be happening somewhere out there. (can you say cloning?) While Joshua Jackson is a good actor and Anna Trov is that much better, the true star of this show is John Noble. His character acting is brilliant. He is, by far, the reason this show is a success. If you're looking for a good series that will access the gambit of emotions, this is it. It's funny, frightening, it will at times tick you off, you will cheer for the good guys and can't wait for the bad guys to get theirs, and when they do you really cheer. Fringe is the total entertainment package.

1593081529|4.0|It seems as though there is a law that every edition of one of Jane Austen's books must be published with a painting of a formal lady or ladies on the cover.  In the case of Emma, such a painting is, perhaps, most appropriate.  Emma, unsurprisingly, tells the story of a young woman named Emma.  She is, as we are quickly told, spoiled and head-strong.  And, as is always the case in Ms. Austen's heroines, young and unmarried.    Emma has recently lost her sister/mother-figure to marriage and appears doomed to a lifetime of seclusion with her kindly, but odd and hermited father.  To avoid such a result, at least for a time, Emma sets to matchmaking.  She finds a neighborhood girl with only limited prospects and attempts to launch her into the stratosphere of an advantageous marriage.  Irony abounds.    This novel reads much like Jane Austen's other materials.  The text is dense, but witty and, at times, quite funny.  The action, such as it is, is slow paced and revolves around the joining together of various singles into couples.  The themes are, as is often said of Austen, private.  The manners, speech and attitudes are largely dated.    I do not consider myself a great Jane Austen fan, but there is no doubting her greatness in crafting this novel.  The characters are as lifelike as ever an author has produced.  The plotting is intricate.  Indeed, only a second or third reading reveals the many hints and suggestions laid before the unknowing reader on his first journey through the book.  The text absolutely sparkles with wit - there are, in fact, moments where one might laugh out loud.  This is without reservation a book that any reader would do well to peruse and study.    That said, I find it difficult to overlook the attitudes of an earlier age and that impacts my enjoyment of the book.  The casual tyranny of Jane Austen's protagonists is jarring to the modern eye.  Indeed, much of Jane Austen's value system is repugnant to me.  Of course, one tries to read the book with respect to the time at which it was written.  In doing so, one finds a beautifully written book about a delightful set of characters who comedically come together.  Ghastly prejudice, however, is very close to the surface, particularly in this book of Austen's.

0312330537|5.0|It seems to me that most of the negative reviews here pontificate on the morality of the author and make judgments based on the same. As a person with a rich and colorful life, full of success and failure, and as a human who has their share of mistakes, I look at the author with no sense of moral righteousness. While his prose can tend towards the flowery, I forgive the author for taking creative license with his incredible life story. I loved it.    The objections I've noted are all based on a \\"that's not what I would do\\" sense of morality, and completely miss the point. Not seeing the forest for the trees, if you will.    I've lived a wonderful life (that fascinates most everyone who knows me well, but pales compared to this story), and can quite comfortably say that this is one of the best stories I have ever read (and I read a lot). If you can't learn SOMETHING from this, you haven't lived or are not capable of self contemplation. Period.

B001R4MEYS|5.0|Mastodon continues to evolve their sound and style. Bands like this give me hope that not all modern music is doo-doo. There are moments on this record where I think it simply isn't possible for music to be any better. I always knew these guys had more in their toolkit than the bombast and screaming of their previous records (though this album has made me go back and listen to those and, true enough, I'm starting to appreciate them). I have seen them play this live and it totally shakes the earth.    At this point, Mastodon are poised to be the next biggest thing since sliced bread. Their song writing and musicianship is better than it has ever been. Brendan O'Brien has really brought forth the qualities that were lurking beneath the surface. If they don't get crushed by the wave of popularity that's going to ensue because of this record, if they can hold their breath, then they are going to be one of the best bands going for the next ten years. On the other hand, this might be the best record they'll ever make. Time will tell. One thing's sure, NOW is the time to see this band live.    I frickin' love this record. Go Mastodon!

It's not that it's a chick flick, because my wife felt the same way about it.  The movie is pretentiously artsy without being artistic.  The characters are developed so poorly you really don't care what happens to them. Save almost 3 hours of your life and avoid this movie.
B0007ZEBI0|4.0|I think they need to balance more of the heavy with the moody,to break it wide open. I like were there at so far.but they need to grow up alot more on there music. Its a good start into getting in to them.I feel there best is yet to come.
B000NDI3SK|5.0|The first time I saw this series I was a sophomore at the University of Kansas in the early 80s. Set to music such as Pink Floyd, this was a fantastic series that attempted to encompass an enormous but diverse amount of knowledge into a coherent view of man's past. Although there has been many changes in contemporary theories of human evolution (physical and cultural), this is still a series well worth watching.
0312360266|4.0|Against her wishes, Zoey Redbird has been Marked a fledgling vampyre. Now she must leave behind the human world she knows in order to just survive and join the House of Night. There she will stay until she becomes a mature adult vampyre, if her body survives the change. But Zoey has greater things to worry about than living to see the next night--her unusual Mark makes her an outcast and shows her great potential when all Zoey wants is to fit in and be normal. These possibilities, like the Change, will make or break her--her unique powers gain her entry into the elite Dark Daughters but their conniving leader is determined to take down this threat to her dubious authority. Zoey must learn to trust the gifts of the vampyre Goddess Nyx, her own strength, and the loyalty of her new vampyre friends if she's to stop the vampyre disaster waiting to happen.    Marked is a unique and intriguing combination of traditional vampyre lore with the modern boarding school. But while I love the concept, setting, and background to this tale, I am not quite as thrilled with the actual story. The Casts set this story up so nicely down to the littlest detail; everything is taken care of from vampyre curriculum to public (human) opinions and stereotypes of vampyres to the interesting vampyre rituals. This take is obviously well researched and well referenced, and thus was a delight to read as the Casts make this vampyre world so realistic. Unfortunately, the story that results was not quite up to my expectations. It is still well written and I can appreciate the interconnectedness of some of the smallest plot details, but, overall, it is a slight mess. The main plotline is easy to follow but then there are these little offshoots that keep the reader second guessing and wondering what the significance is; most of these distractions I felt just take up space as they don't really contribute to the story in any meaningful way unless that has yet to be revealed in later books. Despite the scatterbrained effect, I liked Marked because it was an original and interesting new vampyre read for me.    The Marked series may also be enjoyed by fans of Peeps by Scott Westerfeld and the Blue Bloods series by Melissa de la Cruz, although I didn't enjoy Marked as much as I did those other vampire novels. I'll probably continue this series, but only if I have the time.
B001GCUO1G|3.0|A decent production and the script provides a good explanation of how Logan came to be Wolverine. The explanation fits neatly with the canon of the first \\"X-Men\\" movie. The story isn't necessarily compelling and the special effects are good but not amazing. Still, for a fan of Jackman and/or the \\"X-Men\\" (and who isn't?) - this is a special treat. Beware: Be sure to stay all the way through the credits.
B001R4MEYS|5.0|For many years I didn't like metal--it was repetitive, loud, and generally uninteresting music. But over time my opinion has completely changed, and I have to credit bands like Mastodon for this reversal. Upon first listening to their earlier albums I recognized immediately that every band member is a proficient musician and has an appreciation for his respective instrument. And I don't speak just of their technical ability. Not only can they jump between time signatures, play guitar solos, and pull off busy drum fills; they can write great songs! Their music, while heavy and aggressive, is filled with hooks and memorable lyrics. This is no doubt why they continue to achieve commercial success with every new release.     With that said, Mastodon's new album Crack the Skye is an unbelievable follow up to Blood Mountain, which earned the band a Grammy nomination. Stylistically, they have evolved since their last offering. This time around the music is more melodic with an ethereal, progressive vibe, although still very heavy. Several songs especially capture those elements including the self-titled track, which is named for drummer Brann Dailor's sister, as well as the first single \\"Oblivion\\", definitely the most memorable song on the album.     The \\"more creepy and spaced out\\" qualities of this record, as Brann Dailor put it, highlight something that all great bands do: they progress. Though never compromising their signature sound, they grow personally and professionally as they make careers out of their music, and Crack the Skye represents the point where Mastodon begin to do so. This is by far what makes the album so enjoyable.     Nonetheless, if you happen to be a more musically conservative fan, much remains of Mastodon's \\"heavier\\" sound. Songs like \\"Ghost of Karelia\\" and \\"Divinations\\" maintain the ferocity that identifies so much of the band's previous work. In fact, even the tracks that are purposely experimental have their aggressive moments.     Overall,Crack the Skye is a fantastic album. While it's definitely a Mastodon album, it's an album that represents a Mastodon that have evolved into the band they've always had the potential to become. The musicianship is flawless and every song tells a part of a creative story. I just hope the next record can live up to this one.
B00005JPY2|3.0|It's a beautifully filmed, nicely edited, with particular attention to special effects, film that has an uncertain plot and a weird understanding of the world and its audience. It's the kind of movie that no one really understands but appreciates its sincerity and accomplishment. At the end of the day though, it's not a film that I would rewatch or watch the sequel to it. As it is, I'm glad I saw it in IMAX because, as i mentioned above, the film is visually stunning.
B000JIHP88|3.0|I loved the fact it attached so easily and perfectly to our crib (Munire urban).  Also like the way it looks.  The music is pretty terrible though. At least you can turn it down though.  My son does love to watch the leaves though, so I do not regret buying it.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|David McCullough once again delivers!  A great production which gives us a fabulous insight into our nation's beginnings.  Highly recommend this for every American.
B001FB4W0W|4.0|First, let's get the good stuff out of the way. It's a fun reinvention of the vampire genre. I almost always like vampire stories that tweak or play with the classic \\"rules\\" (sunlight is dangerous, a predatory nature, vampires are inherently evil, crosses offend them, etc...)True Blood's big tweak is that it mainstreams vampires as an persecuted subculture.     That said, here are my two concerns. First, the vampires that live with Bill are cheesy as hell. They completely undermine the larger themes, and I hope they get written out asap.    My second concern is a SPOILER ALERT! Do not, do not, read the following if you haven't seen it. SPOILER BEGINS BELOW.      The show's biggest problem is that it is killing off too many of its best characters. The death toll is way too high way too fast. Even the best shows usually have a limited number of good characters it can come up with. The show gets less interesting towards the end because it has a smaller stable of characters to use, and I am concerned that the new characters it adds for season 2 won't match the murdered characters. What's more, the big reason why most of these good characters died turned out to be a dud of a mystery. But these are SMALL quibbles. I really enjoyed the series as a whole and am eagerly anticipating season 2.
B0000024PC|5.0|When I first watched \\"The Graduate\\", I loved the music so much that I decided to buy the soundtrack.  I was not disappointed.  Simon and Garfunkel really deliver on this soundtrack.  I LOVE IT.
B00003A9OL|5.0|The best album ever in this 4LP version is just awesome... The big cover with a big photos on it... totally recomended...
B001UREJWM|3.0|\\"The Devil You Know\\" offers nothing very exciting or new.  Although the production is very good, the songwriting and musical performances aren't very memorable.  Most of the songs plod along at a slow, thudding pace, and none of them have a great hook. The drumming is competent, but Vinnie plays like he's bored.   Ronnie James Dio does a good job, but he's singing in a lower key now, and he's lost that snarling edge that made him such a great metal singer in past years.  Tony Iommi does a decent job, but there are no memorable riffs or guitar solos.    \\"The Devil You Know\\"  isn't a bad album,  but it's not in the same league as \\"Mob Rules\\" or \\"Heaven and Hell\\".
B000EHSVS2|5.0|For direction, script, cinematography, music, and, of course, acting -- this is the greatest war film of them all; a movie that will stand among the greats for as long as people are around to watch them. It is probable that only an actor of Scott's stature could have brought this character to life, and with such depth. Every scene in this film, every nuance of the character that Scott creates, reveals another dimension of the appalling beauty, blood-soaked poetry, and the magnificent insanity of institutional human slaughter. Watch it again every few years, as the war-madness of our race takes yet another turn of its dark and endless invention, and you will be amazed at the insight of this absorbing film.
B0013FNC38|3.0|I bought this CD for the song \\"I'm Yours\\", I loved the relaxing melody and reggae-ish quality. I actually like all the music on the CD - it's all great, unless you really listen to the words of a few songs. 70% of the songs are really cool, lyrics and music combined, but then you're listening to others wondering, Why did he do this? Mraz feels obligated to make weird pervy comments in some of his lyrics he thinks are poetic. But instead they're eww factor. It's like some nerd sat down and wrote cool music, but then fell victim to his lifelong desire to describe his drooling insatiable geeky lust for hot women. Some lyrics describe a woman's \\"butterfly\\" to the point of you're just like ok I get it! Other lyrics compliment a dancing girl in nothing but stilettos for making his \\"pants tight.\\" Blech. It's only a handful of songs on the CD that are like this, but they're so weirdly icky and laden with super cheese you just can't ignore them. It's like the lyrical version of \\"bad naked.\\"  This style of music and Mraz's style of voice just do not lend themselves to that kind of lyric, at least not the way he does it. It's like jamming to \\"Cheeseburger in Paradise\\" on a Buffet CD, and the very next song is Buffet crooning weirdly about sex and he's not trying to be funny.   Mraz has a beautiful voice and great musical talent, so hopefully his next CD will be even better. FYI to parents out there, granted there is much worse around, but if I had a kid I would not buy them this CD, some parts are just too explicit and skeevy.  As for the lyrics of the other songs, I like most of them. A little philosophical here and there, which keeps it all fun and interesting while providing his happy sounds with some depth. He does better on the songs that don't seem like he's trying too hard.
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|I spoke with my father this morning on my way to work about the newest installation into the Star Trek realm.  He said it best. We have grown up with Star Trek. I started watching Star Trek when I was in 2nd grade. I can remember the first time I got to see the Star Trek movies in the big screen.  I have lived through TNG. I was hooked on DS9. I became enthralled with Voyager. We wont talk about the other series.<br /><br />I saw the trailer for the new Star Trek several months ago and I was thrilled. It looked awesome.<br /><br />I enjoyed every aspect of the movie. I was so excited when I finally got to see the Enterprise - and I got to see the Enterprise kick some good ole fashion butt! The movie is packed full of hat tippings and salutes to TOS and the movies that spun from them.  There are lines that are classic lines that can never die (and not spoiling anything I promise) ... well maybe I shouldn't.<br /><br />I am a HUGE Star Trek fan.  I have always enjoyed the series and for the most part I have enjoyed the movies (not all - but most). I clapped and stood up at the end of the movie and I am pleased to say that JJ Abrams didn't disrespect the world that Gene Roddenberry created.  JJ Abrams amazingly took on a gigantic pair of shoes, stepped into them and did an outstanding job filling them.<br /><br />So - back to what my father said.  Kirk, Bones, Spock, The Enterprise and the rest are our friends.  They are our backyard, football throwin, buddies. They are our companions.  They are people we grew up with and we knew. So we went to the theatre to make sure that the person they cast as our friends was perfect. And guess what? - They Did. The movie was flawless and OUT OF THIS WORLD!!
B000U7SN8O|5.0|Great album, yada yada yada.    Just a comment for all your folks thinking of buying the MP3 album (and since it's ranked like #670 then that would be a bunch of you).    Buy the album: 9.99  Buy ALL the individuals songs: 9.89    What? you say.  That can't be right!    Do the math: 10 songs at .89 and 1 song at .99 = 9.89    I used to LOVE amazon, but they've been doing some sketchy things recently.    And so ends this public service announcement.    (And hopefully someone in Amazon will *notice* and change the pricing.  But, of course, knowing what Amazon is doing nowadays, the individual song prices will go up.)
B001WCN23W|5.0|I am glad to own a version of this album that I can fully appreciate - the remastering is top notch, the vocals are clear the instrumentation can finally be heard.    This new remaster is a worthy upgrade and makes this one extra sticky!
B001N5BDM0|5.0|A great release by Domino: it really is a 2Lp set, 180 gram per LP, sounds really great too.    The gatefold sleeve is beautiful, it's also about 1 cm taller than average, it would not fit in any of my pvc sleeves.    If you like vinyl, get this: for less than £9 I consider this a bargain.
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|I won't go into the details of the movie plot, since presumably anyone on planet Earth already knows by now that this is essentially a movie depicting the events predating the original 1966-1969 TV series.    I gave this movie a 5-star rating not only because it is great entertainment standing on its own, but also because it is true enough to the original TV series (and the plurality of spin-off TV series and movies) to hold the attention of the Star Trek faithful.    Full disclosure of the reviewer and his potential biases:  I am 51 years old, but was never a big fan of the original TV series (either at the time or subsequently).  I did, however, take up a keen interest in the franchise starting with the movies, and \\"The Next Generation\\" TV series.  So at that time (circa 1989) I found I had to go back and see the original TV series so I could understand the background of the movies and the spin-off TV series.  And I found the original TV series to be laughable in many ways.  But the original TV series was the origin for the whole subsequent franchise, so I had to respect it for what it was (and particularly considering the time (1966 et seq.) in which it was produced).    In like manner, one must respect the current movie in light of this heritage, but also considering modern times.  Let me explain:  The current movie is perhaps a bit \\"hyper\\" regarding action and special effects, but this is exactly what it needs in order to be well received by the current generation of movie viewers (i.e., those folks who aren't old enough to remember the original TV series, but who will be following the current \\"Transformer\\" movies).  However, the new movie also contains enough DNA from its progenitors that it will be accepted by the faithful.  In short, this movie strikes a perfect balance between the past and present in all essential ways (production, plot and characters).  A good example is the essential inclusion in the plot of Leonard Nemoy (as \\"old Spock\\"), thus bridging the old and the new, and perhaps the future.    Regarding the past and the future, the story line is particularly clever by using a \\"Back To The Future Part II\\" time-travel concept that allows the writers to ignore (in part) certain particulars in past episodes of Star Trek (both the many TV series and the movies), while still retaining the essentials of the original characters and events.  This allows the writers to take the latest episode (and presumably future episodes) of the franchise \\"where no one has gone before.\\"  Again, a perfect balance.    And now, my views regarding pros and cons of the movie itself (ignoring any issues regarding heritage and the like): Pros: (1) out of this world (pun intended) special effects; (2) excellent casting; (3) excellent acting; (4) good storyline.  Cons: well, the only thing I can think of is the implausibility at the end of the movie that Kirk would be commissioned from a cadet to captain of a starship.  Certainly there should be at least one ranking officer in Starfleet who is better qualified than Cadet Kirk to captain the Enterprise!  In my opinion, Kirk's ascendancy to captain should perhaps have been deferred to the sequel (and you can bet your bottom dollar that there will be a sequel).  Further, the whole cast of characters in the current movie appear like \\"Muppet Babies\\" as compared to their counterparts in the 1966 TV series.  It's just too inconceivable that a group of cadets this young (heck, Chekov is only 17 years old in the movie) would be given overall command of a premier starship!  And particularly given that a large part of Starfleet escaped the destruction which occurred at the Vulcan planet (since a good part of the fleet was at another post during the events depicted in the movie).  But then George Custer was made a General at the ripe old age of 23 (circa 1863), so why not make Kirk a captain at about the same age in the future?  I guess this is all just part of sci-fi - i.e., the implausible can becomethe reality.    In summary, the movie should satisfy the needs of all audiences, making it \\"the perfect balance\\" (and thus a logical balance, of which Spock would approve).
B000SFZ05C|3.0|The Cult's Born Into This is a solid effort, sounds strong and should please anybody who's been into them, but it hardly can be considered a gem in their career. The album was produced by Youth and mainly recorded in London - Ian's voice still great, Billy's playing somewhat more controlled.<br /><br />These years the band relies on the drumming skills of John Tempesta and the bass playing of Chris Wyse, which is fine although it feels as if they are just going through the motions at times.<br /><br />Born Into This was released in 2007 and was the second album The Cult recorded since the milennium. It does sound far-removed from the distorted madness that was Beyond Good And Evil, which means a bit of a return to a classic rock sound, and I welcome that. Not a lot of new stuff then since they released six albums of top brand-new material from 1984 to 1994. Times were different - that must be taken in - but one would expect more of a band which had creativity at its feet.<br /><br />Standout tunes should include the title track, I Assassin and Tiger In The Sun.
B001GCUNYO|5.0|This title won me over with one of the best guilty pleasures I have encountered on a Blu - and it was an awesome film.<br /><br />I have read a plethora of reviews covering the story, and honestly it is simple enough in that of a dad looking to rescue his kidnapped daughter. The quality of the Blu had loads of opportunity to fail with all of the close quarter hand to hand and nighttime action, but they did quite well. There is some hints of grain here and there but it seemed relevant to the scene. Otherwise - a nice transfer. The DTS was superb and bolstered Liam's resounding voice properly. The outer channels did not get used as much as I had hoped, but fortunately they did not score this film where voices and action get drowned out.<br /><br />Now for the fun stuff. I watched the extended version (1:33:25 vs. 1:30:55 on the rated) and turned on the Black Ops option. Two things occur here: 1. A semi-decent trivia track that provides some relevant facts regarding human trafficking and 2. A body count meter, time remaining watch (the 96 hour window) and a miles traveled listing. I loved it. This option finally answered those nagging questions (in an action movie like this) of did that bad guy really die or not, or is he coming back to wreak havoc. For instance, when a car crashes did it really kill every bad guy in the back seat or are they coming back in the next scene - killed meter clicks up 2 spots - answer is no. Spoiler: final count 33 dead, 13 wounded, 12K miles traveled in exactly 96 hours. The only drawback is it removed the subtitles to play the tracks, so you lose all of the French conversation translations. Most of the rated/unrated version differences are towards the latter half of the film (violent half) as at 41 minutes there was only a nine second variance.<br /><br />2 of the commentary tracks are exclusive to the unrated, the side by side documentary provides comparison on the actual shooting stock to the final film cut, a 20 minute making-of provides some nice insight, but then I was hit with a rare emotional moment on a BD supplement. There was a nice film premiere documentary with interviews of cast and crew on the carpet, but most noticeably some very touching footage of Natasha and Liam. Some brief but genuine moments that speak for themselves.<br /><br />An incredibly worthwhile Blu to own, and I rank Liam's performance as a believable action star right at the top.t then I was hit with a rare emotional moment on a BD supplement.

B001GQSY64|3.0|I really liked the tv show and the movie is a great start to that.
6304712944|5.0|I love fantasies and magical movies, and Camelot certainly fits. To see a young king terrified at his coming wedding day, a young bride upset at not being fought over by knights, an idea to bring together all the different kingdoms and have a different type of knight to sit at a round table. But the best of intentions never turn out as expecteed, and to see Guenivere's scorn for Lancelot turn to awe and love, his distress at falling from grace to fall in love with his king's wife, Arthur's torment at finding out the two people he loved best in all the world loved each other, and, in the end, the place known as Camelot under seige, his pure knights fighting again, the round table broken, and his queen about to be burned at the stake. So many songs to convey the emotions. I loved I wonder What the King is Doing Tonight which showed how human young King Arthur was. I will leave parents to determine how suitable it is for children, I simply revel in the music, songs, costumes, settings, and the fulfillment and destruction of one man's dream.
0385341008|5.0|This is more romantic than what I usually read (why is the heroine always the last to know she's in love?) but the book has substance in its depiction of life on Guernsey after the German Occupation in WWII. Told in a series of telegraphs and letters, the stalwart people of Guernsey find mental and emotional escape via literature while they gain perspective on soldiers, young women and poor attempts at cookery. Absolutely well done!
B000F0UV0E|5.0|My Dentist had this CD playing when I was in for some work a few weeks ago. (My Harley rider Dentist doesn't play the typical 'elevator music' all day...) I recognized Knopfler's voice and guitar quickly, but not Emmylou's voice. I had to do some research when I got home. If I could have spoken with Novocaine mouth I would have asked him! If you like 'Brothers in Arms' and appreciate some alternative country and folk music mixed in, I think you'll really enjoy this one.
B001AVEJ1Y|3.0|It was disappointing that the plot of this film completely rules out major events in the rest of Star Trek.  I expected there to be nits, little inconsistencies.  This movie, however, says at the outset that this is a completely different timeline.  It goes so differently, that I couldn't imagine the Star Trek I know evolving from it.<br /><br />The movie itself was good.  The story was not to simple or complex.  There was plenty of action, and it was well done.  I enjoyed the little references to the original series (TOS), although it doesn't make complete sense given how different this timeline is.<br /><br />**Here come the spoilers**<br />The argument that the timeline differences aren't that significant is, IMHO, absurd.  Spock's mother dies in this movie.  She played a role in some major events in Spock's life.  Those events will unfold differently in this new timeline.  Consider the destruction of Vulcan and the resulting Vulcan diaspora shown in this movie.  The role of the Vulcans in the TV series was that of an advanced and intelligent race that supposedly suppressed emotion but often displayed a hint of arrogance or superiority.  Vulcan, we are told in TOS, could not conceive of a conqueror.  The new timeline throws out all of this.  The genocide against the Vulcan would likely dominate their culture in the new timeline.  It spoils any fun of watching the movie with the feeling you're seeing the original characters as there were when they were young.<br /><br />I can accept continuity errors and even a whole new timeline if it were for a reason.  It seems to me, though, they created this new timeline as a writing crutch.  They should have created whole new characters or stayed basically faithful to TOS.  Fanboys would always find some continuity errors, but if viewers could suspend disbelief they could accept that the movie was about the characters they know.  The alternate timeline deviates too much for the movie to be enjoyable on that level.<br /><br />Apart from this huge flaw, Star Trek is a good movie.  I wish they had made it a non-Star Trek film, enjoyable without the references to TOS, or a Star Trek film in the same timeline as TOS.Star Trek is a good movie.

B001NFNFNU|2.0|Angelina's acting is terrible in this film. The role is poorly written to begin with (victimized, saintly mom) but her acting is flat and dead, as if all her real-life kids have drained her energy away. She is dull, listless and her face looks like a wax mannequin's (even before the kid disappeared!) Now that she's famous as a mother, adopting kids from everywhere, Hollywood can't resist trading on her image as Super Mom. Please! Bring back the old Angelina, the wild rebel, the bad girl. Did motherhood ruin her? The story held my interest only because of the real facts of the case are painful to hear. John Malkovich is also totally wasted in this film. Two formerly edgy and risk-taking actors are reduced her to mouthing cliches and indulging in self-righteous poses. What a waste of talent.

B001K3JF7K|4.0|Quiet Nights, the latest CD from my favorite living jazz vocalist, Diana Krall, is quite pleasant to listen to. It even gets better with each hearing.  Yet it is not on the level that I have come to expect from Krall, who is an exceptionally talented small-group leader on the piano as she sings jazz standards.  I cannot quite put my finger on what it is that is not there on this CD. Perhaps it is that the songs and the arrangements are sometimes accompanied by syrupy strings. I think that's what bothers me the most.  I like Krall when she is a bit edgy and even harsh on the keyboard and in her voice.  Let's hope she doesn't turn to children's lullabies next.

B001AVEJ1Y|3.0|I love Star Trek.  I watched the original series since I was very very young.  This movie is great but ... it is flat.  I don't know, I've seen the movie yesterday, it was great but there nothing in the story line, I saw just only special effect and CG.<br /><br />I do believe that the casts are great.  I love Karl Urban, he is really funny.  Zachary Quinto, also great in translated his role as Spock (actually I like him in Heroes better, there are complexity in his performance as Sylar).  I also loved Eric Bana as Nero, he is great for this role.  Unfortunately, the Director did not see that the story should be told by the performance of the casts (eventhough he has casted the most perfect actors and actresses for each role, pity).<br /><br />Surprisingly, I impressed by Chris Hemsworth, the actor who played as George Kirk, J.T.Kirk's father. His acting was excellent.  I had tear in my eyes when he shown his affectionated to his wife and his son at the very last second of his life. \\"I love you\\" was so powerful, I thik the Director should work from that moment and progress to the point that inspired J.T.Kirk to be a better man as his father not like some reckless runaway child who seek some attention from his mother.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|This live set is amazing and performed wonderfully by the master himself.  Leonard Cohen's music is epic and some of the best lyrics you will ever see/hear in your life time.  From his musical debut to this 2009 live set he is still truly the best and hasen't lost a step.  A pleasure to hear and see.

This book has set the baseline for assessing other volumes--it is the standard by which I will judge other volumes. Great book.

I am glad that the movie didn't bash the Japanese that much and I disagree with the other reviews I read about the chemistry between Hugh Jackman and Nicole Kidman; If we all used everybody's opinions about our relationships where would most of us be?<br /><br />It is a well produced movie and had good if not fantastic acting.  I found it very entertaining; enough to purchase my copy immediatly afer viewing my rented copy.

This is potentially dangerous for those with celiac disease, whose only option is to eat gluten-free.

0440237688|5.0|I've waited a few weeks before reviewing Lois Lowry's Newbery Award-winning book, The Giver, because my first inclination is to say: read it. It's awesome. The end. I am not a big reader of science fiction, although on the off chances I do read the genre, I usually find myself enjoying it. One reason I fear I don't venture into science fiction too often is that it's hard to read reviews about the books without learning too much about them, and I like to know as little as possible going into books. With that in mind, I'll try to review this brilliant book giving away as few details as possible.<br /><br />The Giver is told from the point-of-view of Jonas, an almost-twelve-year-old boy. As the story unfolds, it becomes more and clear Jonas lives in a very different world than we do. Details of when and where are scarce, as it is all Jonas knows. The reader is along for the ride as Jonas learns more and more about the community he lives in.<br /><br />One of the things I've loved most about my immersion into children's literature this semester has been the coming of age story. I don't think it's a coincidence so many narrators of children's books; it's the magical age of intellectual awakening it seems. Jonas is a great narrator. He's thoughtful, kind, and increasingly skeptical. Lowry does a marvelous job of telling the story through Jonas's eyes but leaving clues for the reader to pick up on before even Jonas himself does. This layering of knowledge provides suspense on two levels: the reader wonders what really is going on in this strange world and when and if Jonas will fully realize it as well.<br /><br />I cannot recommend The Giver highly enough. It's a fascinating novel, and although it's intended for upper-elementary students, it's appropriate for teenagers and adults too.<br /><br />(Yes, I also realize most everyone with even a passing interest in children's literature read this novel fifteen years ago, and I am ridiculously late to praise it, but I am anyway).

B000CBNZJA|5.0|BEING A MARIAH FAN FROM THE VERY BEGINNING OF HER CAREER (1990) AND HAVING FOLLOWED HER MUSIC FAITHFULLY FOR ALMOST 20 YEARS NOW, I HAVE TO ADMIT THIS IS ONE OF HER VERY BEST ALBUMS THAT I HAVE HEARD IN A LONG TIME. TRUST ME I'M A LOYAL FAN AND MUST HAVE EVERY SONG, INCLUDING REMIXES. THIS ALBUM HAS TWO TRACKS THAT WE'RE NOT RELEASED ON HER AMEERICAN ALBUMS (EXCEPT SECRET LOVE WHICH WAS RELEASED ON THE SHAKE IT OFF SINGLE) AND SPRUNG. THIS ALBUM IS FOR HARD CORE FANS. THIS IS THE THIRD TIME I HAVE PURCHASED THIS ALBUM JUST FOR ONE EXTRA SONG. I JUST WISH SHE WOULD RELEASE THIS ON AMERICAN VERSIONS, HER DIE HARD FANS ARE NOT ONLY IN JAPAN!!
B00004T9UF|4.0|After a \\"Good\\" cd from eminem two months later i went out and bought Marshall Matters LP going in thinking \\"Well it'll be enjoyable like the first, but dunno if i can take his old voice\\" well it's clear he didn't like it much either cause it's gone. Eminem does not only take away is annoying voice from his last cd, he stepped up is game in flow and especially emotion. This is where Eminem begins to take the rap game over.     We start off with \\"Kill You\\" which is not only messed up, shocking, and at the same time makes you laugh, it's a great intro to this \\"Dark\\" album.     Stan is arguably one of the best song eminem has ever made. His storytelling skills shine through the roof on this one. People who never liked rap know the lyrics for this one. People who despise rap bump this song. Simply because it's not just a \\"SONG\\" it's a \\"STORY\\". An amazing track that really shows his emotion, strength in story telling, and just to show everyone how becoming \\"BIG\\" isn't always good.     We then get \\"Who Knew\\" which is a more laid back eminem we like that keeps questioning people, especially parents, how could he have known the kids would love him? That he be a role model to people? In a clever and witty way shows his SSLP type of song without a annoying voice.     Easily the best song on the cd comes next. Everyone i know is blown away by the next song. \\"The Way I Am\\" doesn't just prove eminem is a good rapper. It shows his frustration, his problems, his anger, his love for his daughter, his hate for his wife, his hate for the world, but most of all send a \\"**** YOU\\" message to critics and everyone who hates him. This is about as \\"Raw\\" as you'll ever see eminem.     Next two tracks aren't nearly as good. We get \\"The real shady\\" Another single for eminem to get people to know no one can be him, that he's the real shady. And we get \\"Remember me\\" with eminem more messed up lyrics but an annoying chorus and beat.     I'm back brings the CD back up and isn't only a clever written song but provoking lyrics, great beat, and the best ending to a song ever.   \\"Cause if I ever stuck it to any singer in showbiz  it'd be Jennifer Lopez, and Puffy you know this!  I'm sorry Puff, but I don't give a **** if this chick was my own mother  I still **** her with no rubber and *** inside her  and have a son and a new brother at the same time  and just say that it ain't mine, what's my name?\\"    Marshall Matters is eminem going into a beef with the clown posy, the guys trying to be rockers and rappers. Eminem doesn't even full focus as he talks about his family problems and how now only his girlfriend lets him meet his parents cause he's RICH and FAMOUS. Good beat and a mellow em make a good track.     Drug ballad to alot of people is a good party track but i couldn't stand it much. It's a decent track lyrically but a boring one for me and very skipable.     We then get Amityville. Not only is the emotion on the first track but we get Bizzra who is sick in the head but we get one of the strongest in terms of voice and emotion from eminem in a long time on the third verse. Em rips it and doesn't let up till the verse is over.     ***** please 2 is a good track that shows snoop and dre can spit some great lines and the ending is a nice ending for em to make you laugh a few times.     Kim is a track you might play only once, I've only played it 4 times in my whole life and I've listened to this CD over 200 times. Why only 4 times? Cause it's just downright scary to hear eminem and his anger at his wife. And how he goes and kills her at the end is downright sick yet it's why eminem is known to be one of the most personal rappers around.     Under the influence is a decent D12 track. Eminem has a fun verse and the Chorus is catchy and funny.     We get what will always be one of my personal favorite eminem tracks and almost matches the way I am. Criminal shows Em at his best in wordplay and multi's are just amazing. Eminem is shady 100% on this track with hislyrics of being a crazy son of a ***** criminal is easily one of the best tracks on the CD.     So Marshall matters LP is a great CD and one of the best in the rap genre. It is a dark album, don't get it confused. Eminem isn't playing half the time, and then he can make you laugh, then make you ask \\"Did he really just say that?\\" and go back and forth between different ideas. Eminem begins his reign over the rap game here.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|I've just finished my first listen of the entire album, and I am freaking speechless. Normally I only like a couple of songs from albums (and in some cases bands altogether) but this album is just one hit out of the park after another. I'm amazed that a band that's been around this long still has the mmph to put out addictive, intoxicating, TRULY STELLAR music like this. There's a DARK TONE to a lot of the songs that very few people have dared to even attempt, and they pull it off beautifully.  I can't throw out a couple of favorites because they're ALL incredible for one reason or another. There's NOT A SOUR NOTE in all 12 tracks. I don't just recommend this to DM fans, I recommend this to anyone who likes music with an 80s vibe.
B001AVEJ1Y|3.0|I wish I could say that \\"Star Trek\\" is the film to end all \\"Star Trek\\" films, but in reality, it's your run-of-the-mill summer blockbuster, and no more. It has a definite storyline, but director J.J. Abrams and writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman seemed more focused on developing overwrought action sequences and endless references to the original TV series. If you're at the point where you can only keep winking at the audience nostalgically, you've lost track of what the concept set out to do in the first place. I'm well aware that this movie is critic proof, that it will be a resounding success, and that it will spawn an entirely new series of sequels. But for my money, this reinvention of \\"Star Trek\\" is all about continuing a mission when it should have boldly gone where no one has gone before.    The film opens with an operatic space battle between the Federation and the Romulans. Born in the middle of it is James Tiberius Kirk (Chris Pine), who would grow up in Iowa as a trouble-making rebel who never knew his father. After getting into a barroom brawl--which involved a beautiful young communications officer named Uhura (Zoë Saldana)--he's encouraged by Captain Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood) to finally apply himself and join Starfleet Academy. Kirk concedes, but as we quickly learn from the Kobayashi Maru test, he's not one for following rules. This puts him at odds with a young half-Vulcan named Spock (Zachary Quinto), who designed the test to be unbeatable. Apparently, it's not about winning so much as it's about handling yourself when in the grip of fear.    With the help of a flustered young doctor named Leonard \\"Bones\\" McCoy (Karl Urban), Kirk is smuggled aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise during its first mission to the planet Vulcan, where a distress signal is being sent. When they arrive, they come face to face with Captain Nero (Eric Bana), a Romulan from the future who, for reasons I won't reveal, has a vendetta against Spock. Nero's mining vessel, amonstrosity that looks like a series of claws, twists its way into view, leaving in its wake a manmade black hole that eats everything in its path.    That's about as much of the plot as I'm going to describe. Needless to say, Kirk soon finds himself in command of the Enterprise, and lo and behold, here enters young versions of Hikaru Sulu (John Cho), Pavel Chekov (Anton Yelchin), and Montgomery Scott (Simon Pegg).    Had this film not been so insistent on reintroducing these characters, there's a chance that they could have been developed a bit more. We don't see complex personalities so much as actors doing impersonations of other actors. Urban, for example, is so focused on capturing the mannerisms of DeForest Kelley that we can't look past the mimicry. The same can be said for Yelchin and Pegg, both of whom seem more interested in perfecting their accents than in delving into their roles. Quinto's take on Spock, however, is a bit more acceptable, probably because of we see him struggling with identity and emotional attachment. Unfortunately, these issues play a big part in a subplot that, for lack of a better term, is highly illogical. To describe it would give too much away, but I will say that a Spock scene late in the film is so implausible that it hardly seems fitting of a \\"Star Trek\\" film.    As for Pine, there is the sense that he was trying to expand on a well-established character; we now have some context for Kirk's inflated ego and risk-taking behavior. Still, there are moments when he's reduced to a mere William Shatner parody, which has been done so often by so many other actors that it's virtually a cliché.    I was also disappointed with the character of Nero. His motives are clear, but everything is explained in just one scene, and it passes by so quickly that what he says never really has the chance to sink in. I kept asking myself, \\"What are they not telling us about this character?\\" Everything about him feels rushed and incomplete. Maybe muchof his screen time was left on the cutting room floor. Or maybe Abrams was too invested on the Enterprise crew to give Nero the attention he needed. Whatever the case, something's missing here.    But as I've already said, I know that \\"Star Trek\\" will be a very successful film. Indeed, it does deliver as an action-packed summer popcorn flick, with plenty of high-octane sequences that employ a wealth of elaborate special effects. If this is what you've been waiting for, then by all means, go see this movie. If, however, you wanted something that wasn't simply a long-winded throwback to Gene Roddenberry's original TV series, there isn't much this movie can give you. It was apparently made with the intention of appealing to all audiences and not just Trekkies, but considering how often it ropes the audience in with insider references, I don't think it achieved its goal. Fortunately, I have hope for the next film in the series; since we've been reintroduced to all the characters, there's now the opportunity to actually develop them. Until that time comes, I'll give the filmmakers a heartfelt Live Long and Prosper.
0307408833|5.0|This book is amazing.  I myself do not eat dairy, try to avoid sugar, am wheat intolerant, and like to avoid gluten whenever possible.  Therefore, this book is right up my alley.  If you actually read the title of the book, it doesn't actually claim that all recipes are gluten-free.....it sounds like people are making the assumption, and even worse, people who are reviewing the book are making it appear as though McKenna bakes completely gluten-free.  I have never been to the bakery, but because I do my research before buying something, I already knew that all the recipes would not be gluten-free.  Everywhere Erin goes she speaks about her allergies to *wheat* and dairy, and basically how she made these recipes so SHE could eat sweets again.  She never claims to be a Celiac or to know everything there is to know about gluten-free baking.  If you have Celiac's disease, you will only enjoy half of this book.  If you are like me, you MUST HAVE IT!  Do your research, people!

031606792X|5.0|Shakespeare? Pah! Bram Stoker? Boo! Stephen King? Who? Anne Rice? She wouldn't know a thing about vampires if it hit her on the head. Only a woman who wears magic undies at night could write the greatest book ever! Forget all you know about vampires, because she is the definite expert on them. Her writing style blows away every other writer in the past. Edward Cullen is the most realistic character I've ever seen, Bella has no flaws, and vampires sparkle. IDK why people hate this entry so much. It's great. And if she does write another book in Edward's perspective, I'll jump on it.<br /><br />For a full blast of poetry in motion, get a Twilight book today, even though the movie's better.
0375842209|3.0|The Book Thief is a fresh, new offering on this important topic for kids, who have up until now largely had straightforward (if often wonderful) treatments like Number the Stars. I wasn't crazy about the premise of having Death narrate; I didn't feel the voice was needfully created. But the impression the book leaves is strong, and the reminder of the hardship of civilian life during the war is powerful and nicely done.

B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|I just saw this movie and I loved it. Only 2 ships got blown up. The USS Kelvin and the Klingon Attack Cruiser. The Romulan's didn't appear at all in the film. At first when I saw trailers, I thought the cop was a bounty hunter. Leonard Nimoy (who played Dr. Spock in the original 70's series) appears in the film as Spock's father. They use thier peace sign saying \\"Live Long and Prosper\\". My favorite ship was in it. The USS Enterprise NCC-1701. The most touching moment was where Kirk is promoted to captain of the Enterprise. Another moment which is tradition in Star Trek, at the end of every movie and every series, a narrator comes on and says the following: \\"Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Her ongoing misson: to discover strange, new worlds, to meet new life forms. To boldly go where no man has gone before\\".
B0013V33DG|4.0|A superb performance, but the alleged subtitles -- both the English and the Spanish -- are abominable.  There are ridiculously few, and most of them give the beginning of a sentence and then do not finish it.  The singing is excellent as is the acting.  Juan Diego Florez is the new Caruso, and Natalie Dessay is not only a superb singer, but acts the part of La Fille most charmingly.  The others in the cast are all splendid as well.
0345495004|4.0|This was a great book, although it got a little slow near the end. At some parts, it moved really fast and I was able to read through it without wanting to put it down, but others were a little slower. It was interesting to see how vast a difference it was for women in our country in the early 1900s. It was also neat to hear a little of the history of Chicago back then, as I've recently moved there. I never knew that Frank Lloyd Wright had such a history until I read this book- my grandfather has a house built in his style and I've been to tour some of his houses in Chicago, so it was pretty interesting to learn more about him through this book.

Unfortunately, this version of the movie doesn't have any sort of special feature to speak of, and the menus seem really phoned in.  If you're just looking to pick up the movie to watch every once in a while, as I was, then go for it.  If you're a true Trekkie trying to complete his or her collection, you might be able to find a collector's edition somewhere else.

B001NESPHC|5.0|When I say a \\"better production\\", I mean the sound quality could have been way better. It sounds very dark and standard quality. I guess this recording would have deserved a more careful production. It's really a shame because it would have been almost perfect then. I give it 5 stars only for the music but if I have to rate the sound I would give it 2 or three stars only    Music *****  Sound **

B000005JA8|1.0|If you ask my friends to describe my music personality, they will probably say extremely eclectic and \\"he likes literally everything.\\"  I listen to all types of music from Rock to Blues to Country to Jazz to Classical to Opera to World Music to Folk and all of the sub genres in between.  Perhaps it is why I secured two radio shows playing great music that's not played very often on the air.<br /><br />I had heard some of Captain Beefheart's other stuff before and thought it was pretty decent.  I had actually played some of it on my radio shows.  Upon looking at the Top 500 albums by Rolling Stone magazine, this popped up somewhere in the top 60s.  I didn't agree with the list, but the albums before it were fairly good, so I thought I'd check out Trout Mask Replica<br /><br />I listened once, and once is all I will listen to it.  Perhaps it's my fault I'm a classically trained singer and can't stand horrible singers, but in this album Beefheart really really tested my patience.  When he wasn't almost speaking the words, he was often times flat on his pitches or not even close to on top of them.  Now, that's usually not a problem if it fits the music, but unfortunately there is a severe lack of any sort of melody in most, not all, but most of the songs.  The songs seem to be using weird intervals maybe 4th's and 7th's..which is fine depending how they are used.  Unfortunately, when put in sequence in many of these songs, they just don't make sense.<br /><br />Usually for my radio show I can find ONE gem in a horrible album to play.  It has happened a lot.  This might be the first time I've yet to find a single song to play on my show from a horrible album.  What's even worse is that this album has 28 songs on it.<br /><br />This album is DEFINITELY not for everybody.  If you like Avant Garde music or weird music, go ahead and get this album.  If you can't stand songs that sound like they're straight out of a cartoon on some hard drug then please save yourself some time and money and don't get this album.  Possibly the worst album I have ever heard.  Thank god Captain Beefheart has some good songs that are not on this album.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I really like this workout since it packs a lot into 27 minutes! I have been doing the Firm workouts for 20+ years, and this is a nice change. This is an intermediate to advanced workout, but there are no confusing steps or moves--you can do everything the first time--very basic. There are some exercises that I have never done but really like. I have been trying to lose those last 5 pounds and I have already lost 2, and I haven't even conquerred level 3 yet! This is my new favorite gift for my workout buddies.

B001UREJWM|1.0|To do an honest review of this release, forget who the makers of this album are. Also forget what they have created in the past. Concentrate entirely on the material on this collection.     After listening to each of the tracks I can honestly say not ONE of them stands out as a reason to make me want to buy this. The production is clean & crisp. Instruments are in Tune. Vocals on pitch but there just isn't any MATERIAL that creates that magical spark of kinetic energy that pulls you out of reality and sends you into a sound induced musical high. And I think I you know what I mean. Pull out \\"Neon Nights\\" and how does THAT make you feel?    That being said, the hype created about this release is based on just that, hype. There really isn't any reason it should be in the limelight. Those who are giving this rave reviews are doing so because of what the creators have done in the past, but the past has nothing to do with this release. It should really be left to fade away into the past.     And yes the cover has got to go! Very bad choice.
B001NESPHC|5.0|In over 50 years of listening and collecting recorded music, the number of albums I have heard that consist entirely of memorable music I can count on one hand.  Now I can add Melody Gardot's extraordinary new CD My One and Only Thrill.  Here are 10 new songs of her own composition (with help on 2 by Jesse Harris) and one standard, Over the Rainbow.  These are songs of love - the joy of love so intense it evokes the fear of losing it, and the loss of love softened by the remembrance of its joy.  Each is sung in Melody's rich voice with an intensity of feeling that brings the lyrics to their full emotional life.  The arrangements are beautifully creating and flawlessly executed.  It's frankly difficult to single out any one or two songs for special mention.  Each is wonderful in its own right.  No two are alike.  The only minor occasional detracting element is the string arrangements by Vince Mendoza, which most of the time blend beautifully but sometimes become 1950ish saccharin at inappropriate times.  That's not a serious enough flaw to make this CD anything less that remarkable.  After all, nothing is perfect.  I have to call this my favorite CD in about the last 10 years.    Update (May 29)- I've now been listening to this CD virtually non-stop for several weeks.  I'm even more impressed with the richness and the genuine powerful emotion of the songs.  I still haven't tired of any of them after at least 100 listenings.  The lyrics are wonderful poetry and the music perfectly fresh and complementary.  Just remarkable.  I've also listened to Worrisome Heart a couple more times.  It's very good but not nearly in the class of My One and Only Thrill.  Everyone I know who has heard it has been blown away.

0385338910|5.0|Jonathan Tropper must have consciously picked one of the most uncomfortable topics, becoming a young widow, and made a riotiously funny book about coming out of the shell of mourning.  The humor of \\"How to Talk to a Widower\\" is razor-sharp.  While the plot may be predictable at times, the momentum of the story never runs trite.    A widower at age twenty-nine, Doug Parker has spent the last 13 months of his life not doing much of anything.  Yet his tragedy creates an opportunity one of his sisters to marry his friend.  The wedding starts the cycle that sees his deceased wife's son from her previous life re-emerge into his life and his newly liberated sister decides to move in with Doug and play match-maker.      As if Doug's family did not seemed screw up enough, the dating scene contributes many addition interesting characters to the story.  In a twist that is quite predictable from the character's first appearance, Doug's step-son Russ accidently provides the most promising entry into Doug's love life.    Even while the reader is feeling sorry for Doug Parker, it is hard not to laugh along with him.  It would seem hard to laugh at a widow, but Jonathan Tropper makes it easy in this well thought-out book.

Possession is just an extraordinary literary masterpiece and I recommend it fully.

1400031362|5.0|This is a wonderful story/book.  As you can see it is No. 3 in the series of books by Alex. McCall Smith, which is also a series on the BBC/HBO.  You will love the stories as they transport you into another world of somewhat adventure and humor.
B001AVEJ1Y|3.0|I'm not a hardcore Trek fan, but I am familiar with the Star Trek world, have watched many episodes of its various incarnations on TV, have seen about 5 of its previous movies, and I did enjoy this new movie.  Many have criticized it as a Trek movie, saying it's too shallow, coming off more like a Star Wars flick than a Trek one. There is truth in that, so I understand why hardcore Trek fans aren't exactly enamored with this movie.  So far, this reboot of the movie franchise is one designed for the mainstream. And as such, it is fun to watch, but it's not a perfect movie.  In between the action-packed and humorous moments, it suffers from a somewhat weak script and a rushed pace (it could have used about 20 more minutes).  Aside from the script's none-too-deep arc, the main villain played by Eric Bana is an angry guy with a 25-year grudge, but he's simply not too scary. Any sci-fi movie worth its beans needs a scary villain or villains. Say what people will about the Star Wars prequels, the villains were all scary, whether visually frightening (Darth Maul), politically (the Emperor) or deceptively so (Count Dooku).   The movie also needed the deeper reaches of the TV show. Granted this is a restart, and it spends much of its time giving the backstories to the well-known characters. But, hopefully, future installments will delve into the messages of inclusion that Roddenberry pushed force on the show.  Otherwise, it's just a summer popcorn flick set in space with fancy ships, one-liners and big explosions. Even the Star Wars prequels were more than that, much more.
B000AM6OQ2|5.0|I am a big 70's and 80's John Carpenter fan and The Fog is probably my third favorite film of his. The horror master blends atmosphere, music and chills like no one else. Halloween and The Thing are constantly fighting for first place, but this hair-raising ghost tale is close behind those two. The setting (isolated fishing town), creepy story, one of my favorite musical scores and some revenge seeking ghost pirates makes The Fog a movie worthy of much more praise than most people seem to remember. I try to watch it at least once a year around Halloween time. It just gets me in the mood for my favorite holiday. Too bad John Carpenter hasn't made a decent movie in decades, but the three I mentioned in my review are horror flicks I admire everytime I watch them. They don't make them like this anymore.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I Loved it! Well worth the money! This is one of my favorite Jane Austen novels, and I believe that the movie did a terrific job of translating her book to screen!   Jen Hoey
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|The faces were different, but the characters were the classic crew. To recognize the alternate time line and actually build a new and original work of the people I love was AWESOME!!!<br /><br />I love Star Trek in all its prodigy (Yes even STAR TREK V). I think all the other captains are great, but James T. Kirk will always be the ultimate captain. His NEW younger self amazed me. The Previews could not do justice to the man that the movie fully revealed. Star Trek VI was my ultimate all time movie, but we'll see where it stands after my fifth viewing.<br /><br />Spock has always been my favorite and when I found out that Zachary Quinto was chosen to be Spock I was quite pleased! I have only praise for the other actors as well as their portrayals were fabulous.<br /><br />I can only hope that we see much much more from this new/older generation. KUDOs to the writers, creater, actors, and everyone else who made this one of my best experiences of 2009!!!
B0007TKNIS|5.0|This movie was excellent!  I've seen the play live on Broadway, and watching this movie took me back to the excitement as if I was back in the theater again! I could watch this movie over and over and still never tire of it. I can see why this play is the longest running production on Broadway, and I think that this movie did a great job of giving the watcher that theater feel despite the fact that it is merely on the big screen.

055358894X|1.0|A more appropriate title for this shlockfest would be THE LIES OF SCOTT LYNCH and though the story may be about a con artist, the true con artist is Lynch himself. How in the world such a bloated, overwritten mess ever got such high praise is beyond me. As this is a debut novel, I can excuse some of the \\"oh my isn't this so wonderful\\" reviews written by the author's friends and family. They probably had good intentions, but there are so many of them its a bit too much especially when the book itself is so bland, boring and subpar.    Even when you look past one of the most egregious flaws in the book, the lack of any real depth, you can't help but think that the people in the story are little more than caricatures. It's like the author had an idea for his characters but never bothered to develop them. Even the main character, Locke, is little more than the author's puppet on a string.    Who in the world edited this shlock? Every character from the lowly Locke to the higest born speaks exactly the same. Worse, they all cuss every five seconds, if only for the perceived shock value doing so brings. Apparently, the author believes if he throws the f-word and a few others around with enough frequency no one will notice how poorly written and subpar his story really is.    Someone also should demonstrate to the author the difference between showing and telling. Clearly, he doesn't understand the difference. He's constantly telling when he should be showing, and it pulls you right out of the story.    Composing sentences isn't the author's strong suit. He constantly drops verbs (no I'm not kidding). Characters sigh, grunt, cough, etcetara their dialogue more than they say it. Note to author, the word is said. Said is a word. Character don't need to look at their feet, shift their hands, cough, grunt or sigh everytime they prepare to speak.    It gets worse. One minute the author's describing things in minute detail, the next no detail at all. Examples a plenty:    Lockecouldn't tell if the four women were truly beautiful, but they were undeniably striking. ***Huh?    Idler's day, the eleventh hour of the morning, at the shifting revel. ***Huh?    Calo snorted, \\"This Gray King mess will be over in a few months, Bug.\\" ***Huh?    \\"This isn't working,\\" he said, less than two hours later. \\"I'm sorry, it's ... not your fault.\\" The room was dark and exceedingly pleasant. *** Huh?    The Gray King's man threw down his crossbow and reached for a blade at his belt. Locke scooped up the crossbow and fell upon the intruder, howling. *** Huh?    Locke and Calo slipped down the hallway, sweating now, but barely letting their heavy cloaks flutter as they moved. \\"Listen,\\" he murmured. Clang, clang... footsteps...clang, clang. *** Huh?    This awful prose fills this book and the others Lynch has written. It doesn't get better as it goes along, I wish it did since I bought the entire awful series.
B000002UDB|5.0|I bought this along with the Sgt. Pepper album.  I was unable to find a bad song on either CD.  My favorite on this CD is my all-time favorite Beatles song.....I am the Walrus.    I enjoyed this CD better than Sgt. Pepper but they are both excellent.    Tom De Mann  Las Vegas
B001AVEJ1Y|1.0|Oh wow aliens in mechanical suits beyond our own technology come down to earth and set people on fire... Where have I heard this storyline before?  Oh yeah, HOW ABOUT \\"WAR OF THE WORLDS\\" By H.G. Wells?!  Oh no no no, but this time they change the names of some of the characters and call it \\"Star Trek\\", please Hollywood.  How many more ideas are you gonna steal from classic authors and try to write off on your own?  Is Hollywood REALLY that washed up?  Instead of seeing \\"Star Trek\\", I really suggest just reading \\"War of the Worlds\\".    QUIT STEALING IDEAS HOLLYWOOD!
0201721481|4.0|I would like to say this is a great C++ book only for those who:<br /><br />1. want to write serious C++ code, instead of \\"Hello World\\";<br />and 2. already know some C;<br />and 3. want to focus on those C++ specific features;<br />and 4. want to have only ONE C++ book, rather than a group of books.<br /><br />C++ is a complex language, and this book reflects it.  Some concepts, such as vector, are discussed in the earlier stage of the content, and mentioned again later in the book.  And content about the modifier const are scattered around page 50ish, ~180, ~250, and page 400ish.  This does frustrate people (including me) who want to use this book as a reference.<br /><br />However the authors did it on purpose: they want to make the learning curve less steep.  I start to appreciate it after I have spent some time read the book carefully and tried running sample C++ code.  For example, the const modifier has some profound effects on variable, reference, pointers, objects and in argument passing.  It also impacts the performance of function call: you just can not put all of these in one section.
1400031362|3.0|This third book in the delightful series by Alexander McCall Smith continues the mysterious and personal adventures of Mma  Ramotswe--intelligent founder of the Ladies No. 1 Detective Agency.  Set in emerging Botswana this book presents the brilliant protagonist still engaged to the kind mechanic, Mr. Maketoni, as she embarks on new professional challenges.  Since her modest business faces a deficit cash flow, she enlists the aid of two lackadaisical auto apprentices to move her office to the greasy premises of Speedy Motors. In so doing she promotes her secretary/assistant detective to Acting Manager of the garage. Now Mma Makutsi must combine her sleuthing and typing duties with overseeing the operations of an automotive repair shop.     Several mysteries--not all of which are resolved in these pages--crop up to capture the reader's interest:  the strange case of a Wild Child who speaks no words and smells of Lion; a Goverment Man who swears that his brother is being poisoned by his wife's greedy family; the judge of a beauty competition who fears for the integrity of his young nation.  Lastly the disturbing case of Maketoni's sudden indifference to the fate of his own business; what secret from his past haunts this compassionate man, who a adopted two children from the Orphan Farm on the spur of the moment?  What causes this great depression and malaise? If you are not already a fan of this unique detective agency, you soon will be! Consider this book just another in the wonderful, intriguing series which celebrates traditional African values and promotes the role of emancipated Women.  You gotta love `em!
0618918248|5.0|Elegant. Smart. Rational. Objective. Well written. Logic. Factual. This book will take you from a simple explanation of why we've created God to a complex analysis of the human psyche.  If you are a true believer of REASON you will read it twice.  If you are a religious person, you might get angry even curse.  I understand, truth is hard to handle. No matter what or who you are, it will move you, it will stir up feelings and will make you think. It will free many from the iron claws of religion, fear and pain.  I suggest, get the book for your nightstand and the audio version for your car.  All you need is to listen, all I can say: Thank you Mr. Author for your courage and hard work.  This book changed my life.  It is good to be a humanist.

0810993139|2.0|A #1 New York Times Bestseller, I had to find out what this book was all about it. I had heard good things about it, but mainly all from the younger audience, and for good reason. Recently, I have been reviewing young adult novels that could be also enjoyed by someone older and/or has a more sophisticated taste for literature. This is not one of those books; kiddies, you can keep this one to yourselves. It is perfect for younger readers, but adults should be weary to expect too much. And since I assume no younger readers are checking out this book review blog, I can focus this review to you more \\"refined\\" readers.     Greg Heffley keeps a journal because it will make things easier for him when he is rich and famous. Instead of answering questions about his past from numerous reporters, all he will have to do is show them his journal and be on his way. Right from the start, Greg has dreams of becoming well known and popular. This may seem like a stretch since Greg figures himself to be 52nd or 53rd most popular and his best friend Rowley is \\"probably hovering right around the 150 mark.\\" Greg uses his diary to describe life in middle school, even though he has said, \\"Just don't expect me to be all `Dear Diary' this and `Dear diary' that.\\" Lucky for us, without Greg's entries we wouldn't know what was going on with his plans. From Halloween pranks to the school play to wrestling to safety patrol to the newspaper comic strip, Greg is constantly trying to put himself out there and move up in the rankings. However, when Rowley gets the job as the newspaper cartoonist and starts to become more popular, Greg is jealous and things fall apart. By the end of the novel, Greg must find a way to fix the friendship strained by the social pressures of middle school.     Described as \\"a novel in cartoons,\\" I would classify Jeff Kinney's work as a very wordy graphic novel. Greg's words are only made more entertaining by the number of cartoons and doodles he adds to his daily entries.Since this novel is taking place over an entire school year, there are several different short storylines going on, all of which are mildly entertaining, but only few work to weave together an actual novel. It seems more like a collection of short stories instead. The novel starts with a plan to become popular this school year, but this plot line does not resurface until towards the very end of the novel. It's like Greg went through his school year and then finally remembered his plan when there was only a month left of school. Again, these shorter segments are mildly entertaining (with much credit due to the cartoons), but that is not enough to save the novel as a whole. It did not flow well enough to be given the title of a novel. I would rather have read Greg's tales as individual stories than try to weave them together on my own. Jeff Kinney's novel is very successful, but I believe it is because it is perfect for younger readers who need shorter segments in order to remember and comprehend what is going on.     My previous young adult novels, I believe, can be read by any age, but Diary of a Wimpy Kid may only be enjoyable by younger readers for its formatting and type of humor. I can see how they would enjoy this book, and I totally understand why it would become a bestseller, but I would never tell another adult to read this book without the purpose of being able to relate better to the younger generation. Some parts were interesting, but in all, this is overwhelmingly a novel for young readers only. With the content and its use of cartoons, this would be the perfect book for a younger reader unexcited by books and reading to slowly adjust to love them.       (Brief Summary: Kids- enjoy it! Adults- give it a try, but beware.)     \\"The greatest gift is a passion for reading.\\"   - Elizabeth Hardwick
0805086846|5.0|I have to first start off by saying that I have never trusted anyone who was or is a politician. I have always said that politicians lie, cheat and steal from their so called friends. So now on that happy note I have to say that I am some what surprised at what I read in Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee. Mainly because of the way The White men swindled the Indians out of their land. As I read the book I would gasp at the things that I read. I hate to even think that I am possibly related to any of those white men. I do remember reading about the Trail of Tears, when I worked in the fourth grade. I just remember not really understanding why that happened. You are made to think that the Indians did some thing wrong and are savages.<br /><br />This is a book that everyone should take the time to read. There is so much more information in this book then in any American History book you will ever read. We owe those Indians a lot. As I was reading the book I was talking to my husband's one uncle and he said that I would be shocked by the truth. He was right. And to think that all these years I never knew what I know now. I am glad to say that my kids are part Indian/Native American on their father's side. My son has been told that he looks like a Native American even with is red hair and blue eyes.<br /><br />I loved this book and I am going to be looking for more books about Indians/Native American.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|What can I say except this is thoroughly enjoyable.  One of the best animated movies I've seen.  First, Dr. Seuss is always entertaining anyway with his weird humor and creations and this is one of his best.  Second, you get some of his best work at teaching truths and virtues with the two most noted:  Just because you don't see something or you perceive it in a certain way does not take away what the truth could be (misperception, misjudgement) and prejudice (crazy elephants, small people).  Third, you have a collection of comedy's finest talents (Jim Carrey, Steve Carell and Carol Burnett among others) doing their thing.  This is more than just a kids movie.  This is a classic.  I thought the original was decent but this version had me laughing so hard I missed parts so I'll be watching this many times before I get tired of it if I even get tired of it.  I don't think I will.  An elephant may never forget but I do so let's watch it again.

032147404X|5.0|Writer is well known and experienced in digital photography field. I used to be a film SLR amateur photographer and moved to point and shoot later due to constraints.     I am planning to take up digital photography more seriously and this book was a good start to rekindle my interest in Digital SLR photography. It helped in building my online shopping cart and provided good pointers for research. After reading this book I have more realistic expectations about my budget and photography.    You need not be top photographer or a professional or a Digital SLR owner to find this book useful. This book can be used by average photographer, it has valuable tips for any photographer (including point and shoot photographer).    Enjoyed my reading and could not stop reading this book.   Some interesting learning's:  - A small trick like using a white board/paper or black valvet/valour cloth as background when photographing flowers or portrait.  - Why you need tripod, we all know that but still we don't think we need one.  - How to show size.  - How to use different weather for photography  - Tips for panoramas    This book will not explain you some basics like depth of field etc. So if you know what is 'depth of field' and other basic stuff about SLR photography and do not want to die reading about it again and again this book is for you.
B000L212HC|5.0|Do you promise not to tell?<br /><br />The first part is called the pledge.<br />The second act is called the turn.<br />The third part is the prestige.<br /><br />This movie, &quot;The Prestige&quot; starts out looking like any other formula rival movie you know pretty much how it's going to end; yet you are intrigued with the details of the journey. We have seen twists and turns before and are no stranger to them so we expect twists and turns during and at the end of the movie or do we?<br /><br />Two friends who are aspiring magicians take part in a tragedy that will change their lives. Do these magicians really care about anybody or anything or are they just intent on doing one trick better and knowing the other persons secrets?

So you may not realize the a lot of the best acting was done by Michael Caine as Cutter the man who helps most everybody throughout the movie.<br /><br />Now I know there's still a few of you out there that are intrigued with the details of the presentation such as Blu-Ray. However it's time now to realize that we raise just one more tool and is now commonplace. However, I can tell you that you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001R88C6I The Thirteenth Floor [Blu-ray]]]
B001U0HBPQ|5.0|This movie is long but it was worth it. I was hooked from beginning to to end. I loved every character in this film. I even loved the man that asked constantly \\" Did I  ever tell you I was struck by lighting seven times\\".    I respect the opinions of others and some hated the movie. I even feared that the movie would be more hype than substance. I was pleasantly surprised in my humble opinion it was fantastic.     If you are reading reviews for this movie in an attempt to decide if you should buy, rent or not bother. Rent the movie first before buying it or passing on it based on the reviews on this site. This will keep twenty two bucks in your pocket if you hate the movie. If you love it after renting it then you will not mind spending twenty two bucks on Mr. Button.     Just my humble opinion.
B001IBIQU6|5.0|It was not love at first listen, I have to admit, but on the fourth-fifth time I was hooked. Give them a chance!!!! A lot of people still compare anything they do to Violator, and I think it's so wrong (WRONG!), it's almost like holding it against them. It's not the 80s, and not even the 90s. It is the sound of Depeche Mode in 2009, and I couldn't be happier that they are still going strong.
B0007Y08PQ|2.0|The special effects are acceptable. The acting top notch. The story line is good though the plot somewhat weak. This would have made a much better tv episode or made for tv movie than a theatrical release. I feel this movie doesn't know what it wants to be--a love story, an action/adventure, a drama, a comedy. It tries its hand on all the elements yet comes up short. It's a good effort that just doesn't pay off at the end. It's one of the weaker movies in the series, but still enjoyable enough to watch on a Saturday night with the family.

Yes the play back is a little grainy but still a reflection of the enviroment and the times that it was made in.  It is cool.
0756405890|1.0|I wouldn't mind so much that the author is a megalomaniac or even that he's a narcissist. I mean you only have to read his dozens of \\"I love myself so much\\" blogs to figure that out but what bugs me is the guy's gall. He's the author of two books, and he's already got a god complex.   Imagine how gigantic his ego is going to get? I don't think he'll fit in the same room with himself once that happens. Besides that these gushing reviews written by family, friends and former students are so over the top they're ludicrous.     The only reason I finished this \\"turkey\\" of a book was because I though something worthwhile would happen. There was nothing worth my time and my money. Never!! Suffice to say that I won't be reading anything by Rothfuss ever again.    The editor of this \\"brick\\" should be fired, banned for life, and shipped off to some to Antarctica. Or maybe no editor was hired? If so, it would explain loads and wouldn't surprise. Rothfuss is really a no name nothing except for all the massive hype family, friends and former students have conjured up for him.     What a mess! In the end, Kvothe is proven as full of himself and money and power hungry as the egomaniac who created him.    I've read hundreds of books and can honestly say this is the only one I regretted starting in the first place. Ever!! Nothing new or original here. By the middle you wish Kovthe would get one through the heart already. By the end you're willing yourself into the book to do the job yourself.
B0012Q732O|2.0|Effects good.  acting VeryGood, characters good.  Story line.... a bit out of the ordinary, mixing multiple timelines and histories into a mini epic.  Creative but ultimately a little weird
0440244870|1.0|I am very disappointed by this book, especially since it was supposedly so good as to be made into a movie.  The character is extremely unlikeable, not only do her actions ruin her own life but they hurt other people's too.  Like the issue with her parents neighbors, which I find irresponsible and disrespectful.  It reminds me of those movies where you cringe watching the main character make a complete fool of themself because you can see it coming a mile away.  She's one major disaster after another.  I'm about 3/4ths of the way done and just put it down because it was so depressing, but since I have it I'm finishing with the hopes this girl gets a clue and the book gets much better!!
B0024FAR5M|5.0|Just to point out to a previous comment. It's about a biker gang. Women are NOT in biker gangs. They can't even wear the vests or anything with the insignia of the gang on it. They are just \\"old ladies\\" or whatever they choose to be. Read up about the outlaw biker gangs.    My husband and I LOVE this show! Greatly done, and it's obvious that the creator knew a little bit about outlaw biker gangs or it would've become hollywood crap like many other movies and such.

With 3 guitars, bands' sound is richer and heavier than ever. The three 9 minute epics \\"Nomad\\", \\"Blood Brothers\\" and \\"Dream Of Mirrors\\" are really good songs with their thoughtful lyrics. Also the last song \\"The Thin Line Between Love and Hate\\" is another great song with its tempo, melody and good lyrics. If you like 80s Maiden albums (PowerSlave, Somewhere in Time) and solo albums of Bruce/Adrian, you'll fall in love with Brave New World.

B000063DIH|5.0|A real solid release. in the world of maiden this one doesn't rank at the top of the maiden list,but still a solid release,Fear of the Dark is generally under-rated, but it does have plenty to offer, even to a non-maiden fan. Perhaps this is the reason why it is critized by maiden fans, it is different from their old stuff (not quite as heavy). Songs such as 'Wasting Love', 'Childhood's End' and 'The Fugitive' show this. Many people critize that their stuff is generally weaker on this, which it is, but they are comparing it to Maiden's earlier work which was amazing; the songs on here are still very good. Plus, there are some absolute classics on here, including 'Afraid to Shoot Strangers', 'Be Quick or Be Dead', and of course 'Fear of the Dark'.

His half brother's all for clawing and scratching.<br />3. Regenerative benefits see them through the Civil War, the World Wars and Vietnam<br />4. Things get interesting when they get recruited for a select mutant group and sent to recover a valuable object.<br />5. Brotherly feud intensifies.<br />6. Young man, now named James Logan (Hugh Jackman) undergoes major surgery and becomes Wolverine.<br />7. Oooh, Shiny!<br />8. Rather convoluted story follows, involving lots of CGI, stunts and of course several (mostly underutilized) mutants.<br />9. Anticlimactic ending is quite unmemorable.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman will forever be Wolverine, but Liev Schreiber holds his own as the scene-stealing Sabretooth. Throughout their love/hate relationship it's Sabretooth who carries the movie, and if not for Wolverine having nicer claws, it would probably be Sabretooth you'd remember.<br /><br />See this one for Jackman, Schreiber and the action sequences, not for the plot.

1400067936|5.0|If you are an economist, financial analyst or MBA you will probably feel insulted by Taleb at least once every 10 pages or so.  But Taleb makes a point and makes it well.  A lot of analysis is no better than astrology.  People see patterns even where there are none.    And its about time someone really exposed the whole hoax with the \\"Nobel\\" prize for economics (It's really the Royal Bank of Sweden Alfred Nobel Memorial Prize, not created by the original Nobel foundation).  For all its psuedo-scientific mathematical models, economics is really not a science at all.  If it were, it would have noticed that it's heralded models don't match reality.
B000002UAR|5.0|What more can I say about Revolver but Classic Beatles! I remember recording this album from my oldest brothers collection on to my little portable 3 1/2 reel-to-reel recorder. There was so much wow and flutter on my recorder but I still remember how much I enjoyed that album...and now I have this classic on compact disc! Truly one of my all time favorite cd's!
B001K3JF7K|3.0|I was disappointed because it seemed that I had heard her recordings of some of these songs previously and was hoping to have some new material.  I will buy the next CD when it is released, I am a Krall fan but could have done without this disc.
B001KVAMM4|5.0|There is no question that Miss Mutter is a big-time star, and deserves her stardom. Her music production is faultless, and she looks good in a tight dress. That she has all the warmth and charm of an iceberg is not her fault......<br /><br />Everbody and his/her brother/sister has recorded the Mendelssohn, and a FEW have even done it right; Miss Mutter is certainly among their number. Superb interpretation (a little fast for some tastes) perfectly presented. I continue to prefer an old Mischa Elman recording, but, that aside, this is as good as any, and better than most. Maestro Masur, naturally, leads a great orchestra to perfection.<br /><br />The piano trio, with Previn and Harrell, is likewise done with technical skill and plenty of style...these are \\"old pros\\" who know just how great music should be made......<br /><br />I actually prefer the CD to the DVD, though I admit the sonic and visual excellence of the latter. If you want to HEAR great music well performed, Miss Mutter is your cup-of-tea. If you want visual beauty with feminine charm AND great playing, look up Sarah Chang's performance of the Mendelssohn with Maestro Masur and the NYPO. Five stars? Sure. Miss Mutter is a GREAT violinist. That her beauty reminds one of a block of ice, and that she has all the allure of an operating room....well, nobody's perfect.
B000FC1K66|4.0|Having seen the movie first, I did find it hard to make myself continue reading into the last half of the book (knowing what was coming).  However, it was a surprisingly fast read, a beautiful story that was definitely honored by the film.
B001UREJWM|3.0|If you like Black Sabbath - Heaven and Hell and Mob Rules, but were not a big fan of Dehumanizer, they you won't be a big fan of this new H&H release, which sounds like Dehumanizer Pt. 2. Personally, I thought the Iommi/Hughes releases were stronger.

031606792X|5.0|I read this book with both anticipation and sadness; at this point in time, this is the last book in the Twilight Saga.  I didn't want it to end, but I wanted to know what happens.  I used to smirk at crazed fans, but am now one myself.     Without giving away too many plot lines, we find Bella struggling to reconcile her human life with her desire to become immortal (yes, more of this-- but with threats from the Volturi, she's under pressure).  I think Edward stuggles as much - not wanting to take human experiences away from Bella, but deeply wanting her to live in the security of his immortal family. Jacob still opposes Bella's wishes in every way, believing that he is a better choice for Bella than Edward.  Jacob finds his place in the pack.  Events unfold, the Cullens fear immenent destruction while the wolves prove to be their closest allies.  Other reviewers have complained that everything works out all to well, with few upsetting losses-- but after hanging in with four books, I am a proponent of the happily ever after  scenario.      I wanted to LOVE this book and while it's well written and engaging, it was just a little off. It has the feeling of being written by someone else -- the characters were not them selves. My biggest complaints: Bella matured far too rapidly-- I expected the end would reveal that she was telling the story form 30 years in the future.  In this book, she seemed to immediately shed her teenage self and acted (sounded) like she was a well educated 30+ years old - it was a little off-putting. She just didn't seem the same person anymore. Everything was too easy for her -  the transformation, getting the best of mortal & immortal life, Charlie's acceptance, etc.  I began to wonder why becoming a vampire was such a bad worrisome thing?  To know that life is happy, there needs to be a contrast of loss and sadness. Edward was just a bundle of worrying, fretting, over-protective annoyance, some of his charisma & mystery was missing. Renesseme was a strange addition, though I overlooked the mechanics - wouldn't vamp sperm be like a venom to a human?  Everything is a little too easy for the Cullens, especially money-- sometimes I felt like Meyers was saying that if you threw enough money at a problem, it would work itself out. At least the ending felt like everyone ha the same chemistry as before.     While I hated to see the books come to a close, I am mostly satisfied with the ending.  Yet, if Stepahnie Meyers can find a little more mischief, there are more stories to be told about this interesting family.     In general, I wonder why the Cullen \\"kids\\" endlessly attend high school?  Were they truly afraid of truent officers?

B0026GBIB6|4.0|DEPECHE MODE returns with their 12th full-length album on a new label, Capitol Records and features a refreshing blend of the group's traditional synth sounds but also incorporating a dramatic but less brooding sound.<br /><br />As a long time die-hard fan of the group, one of the difficulties I have had when \\"Ultra\\" and \\"Exciter\\" came out is putting a lot of their classic work away and not be stuck within the confines of the mindset of \\"the way they were\\".<br /><br />Even to this day, I still have \\"Violator\\" and \\"Music for the Masses\\" in my playlist and no matter how many years have passed, I just love the music that they produced during the 80's and 90's.<br /><br />And for their last full-length album, although I did find \\"Playing the Angel\\" (their latest full-length album from 2005) quite satisfying, after several years of not receiving newer music, suffice to say that I have been looking forward to this new album and here we are nearly four years later with \\"sounds of the universe\\".<br /><br />The band reunites with producer Ben Hillier (who produced \\"Playing the Angel\\") and the group has communicated that the sound of this album is to bring images of the universe and space travel. But listening to tracks such as \\"Fragile Tension\\", \\"Peace\\" and \\"Jezebel\\" conjured up images of their 80's work. In fact, a song like \\"Peace\\" was like a tease as I was expecting to hear one of their older tracks \\"See you\\" but nevertheless, when you hear these old nostalgic synth sounds you can't help but smile and think that perhaps David Gahan, Martin Gore and Andrew Fletcher knows that many of us still cling to their past music.<br /><br />But of course, you get pretty cool tracks such as the single track \\"Wrong\\" definitely had that sexy, edgy David Gahan-driven track that is quite addictive and then you get the schmoozy but sexy Gahan/Gore track \\"Little Soul\\". And of course really cool tracks like \\"Jezebel\\" which definitely has cool synth sounds and \\"In Sympathy\\" with it's cool groove, with the underlying experimental tones playing behind-the-scenes.<br /><br />Overall, \\"sounds of the universe\\" is an album that grows over you in time. During the first playthrough, I was thinking that the album was OK but by the second and third playthrough, I found myself digging the tracks and listening to it more and more. You do get a little of everything in this album and there are songs that are catchy and addictive but I found myself gravitating towards songs like \\"wrong\\" and the songs that felt like classic DM!<br /><br />After all these years, more than three decades later, DEPECHE MODE still are able to create good music and there are no signs of wear. \\"sounds of the universe\\" was a good album but I truly felt that in the end, it was not the album that hits you immediately.

B001AVEJ1Y|4.0|Star Trek is a close relative of [[ASIN:B000AYELVA X-Men ]] and [[ASIN:B00005JNJV Batman Begins ]], taking a rightfully deserved place as a great origin story that re-boots a classic franchise.  It is fun, action packed, and has a story that should please just about anyone who is a fan of Star Trek in any capacity.  It is hard for me to step back from what, for me, is quite literally a lifetime of [[ASIN:B001TH16DS Star Trek]] watching.  So I'm not sure how \\"accessible\\" it really is to the non-fan.  My wife enjoyed it quite a bit, even though she said that many of the lines seemed like inside jokes she didn't get, and she was right.  The entire sequence with Spock played like an extended bit of fan-service to my mind, but as a fan I liked it quite a bit, although I can see how it would seem like a tangential plot for non-fans.  The screenplay plays up the humor elements the universe, and is not afraid to embrace big sci-fi ideas.  Of all the material by Orci & Kurtzman, this is the most mature and well written.  The effects are by far the best Trek has ever seen, and Abrams biggest visual gift to the film is his energetic and beautiful cinema style.  It breaks away from the usually staid visuals of previous Trek efforts without becoming just another hyper-kinetic visual mess.  Even his almost laughable use of constant lens-flaring keeps the shots interesting and dynamic.  All the actors in the piece are fantastic, with just about every one of the diverse characters getting a chance to really shine.  Pine & Quinto are great as the leads, channeling the essential traits of the original performances without descending into imitation.  Karl Urban is the real highlight though, bringing passion, humor and humanity to Dr. McCoy that of all the performances best captures the appeal of the original character.  Eric Bana has a thankless role as a villain who gives hints of a tragic side, but never really emerges as a full character.  As I said the visual effects are beautiful and different, particularly the way that the Enterprise moves, conveying both speed and power, in much the same way that the light frigates in [[ASIN:B0001HLVS2 Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World ]] seemed formidable but also capable of darting about with a nimbleness that might surprise you.  [[ASIN:B001Z920NA Michael Giacchino's score]] is also a standout, utilizing familiar Star Trek themes only in a medley over the end credits.  The main theme is Star Trek-esque but totally new, fitting with the new franchise.  I'd love to see more from these characters and this creative team.  Much like the first [[ASIN:B000AYELVA X-Men]] and [[ASIN:B00005JNJV Batman Begins ]] films, most of the running time is spent just bringing all the elements together, and we only get a few minutes of the actual crew working together near the end.  To see what they can do once the characters are established and the focus can be on telling a full story will be the real test.  Will it be [[ASIN:B000AYELVU X2]]?  [[ASIN:B001GZ6QC4 The Dark Knight ]]?  Or [[ASIN:B000HCO83Q X-Men - The Last Stand ]]?

B001KVZ6F2|5.0|Eastwood's character, Walt Kowalski, is a deeply flawed man...a man seared by all the traumas that have burned him during his many years of life.  Perhaps, the most deeply felt of his traumas, is his experience during the Korean War in which he killed...at least...thirteen of the oriental enemy, some little more than kids.  They were a lot like, or so Kowalski painfully speculates, his young Hmong friend.<br /><br />This is a tale not so much about redemption [although it could be confused as such] as a tale about the difficulty of interpreting...or judging...a person by his surface demeanor.  Kowalski is in a very real sense, every man, grown bitter and cynical with age.  He is us, filled with the prejudices which...despite all our denials...structure all of us.  Despite this, Kowalski, again like most of us, is a thoroughly decent human being.  He reacts to injustice but, like very few of us, he does something about it.<br /><br />He attempts to protect his Hmong neighbors from hoodlums.  Unfortunately, one of his actions against these punks results in reprisals in the form of a driveby shooting and a brutal rape.  Disgusted with himself and even more disgusted with the gang members, Kowalski acts deciseively to end the terror and protect 'his' oriental family.  It is, perhaps, not the ending favored by most Eastwood fans, but is all the more potent because of its simplicity.<br /><br />I enjoy he way Eastwood deals with 'racism' in this film.  Through his character, Kowalski, we see a decent man clothed in the camoflage of superficial racism.  Conversely...and I think there is a 'conversely'...we recognize that there are politically-correct individuals, who would never let an ethnic comment slip through their lips, who aren't decent people at all.<br /><br />Ron Braithwaite, author of novels...'Skull Rack' and 'Hummingbird God'...on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico
B000BJ7BCK|3.0|Let's face it; this movie isn't one an adult is going to go see by themselves.  They are going to sit through it with a kid.  Sometimes, that can be pure torture.<br /><br />Sky High is entertaining once you 'buy into' the premise.  It makes sense and is 'logical' within its own conceit.  And it's pretty fun to watch, too.<br /><br />Yes, it's predictable, and no one is going to get massacred in the end.  But the actors are good, they don't over act to the point of being campy.<br /><br />I'd recommend this movie to a parent, an aunt, a grandparent who wants a family-friendly way to pass the time.

B001MYIXAC|4.0|Some of you may be wondering if those who are complaining about the bad subtitles are exaggerating. They are not!<br /><br />I am listening to the English language 5.1 audio and just discovered they're reading the original \\"good\\" theatrical subtitles. They make many scenes much more sensible.<br /><br />If you want to experience complete frustration, play the English 5.1 audio with the English subtitles on. You will understand why there is so much anger. The bad subtitles really do change and/or ruin some scenes.<br /><br />Unfortunately, some of the English language voice work does not do the script justice, so listening to the Swedish and reading the original subs would be ideal. But you can't!!!<br /><br />What a shame! This is the sweetest yet most haunting film I've seen in years. I don't want to admit how many times I've watched it the past eight days.<br /><br />But... this is a very quiet, slow movie. If you expect a lot of screaming and bloody fangs, you're in the wrong place.<br /><br />This is basically a love story... with moments of real horror and dread. Plus some understated but eerie special effects. They're not flashy, just effective. This movie makes you believe there might actually be vampires lurking about.<br /><br />Speaking of love: that's what I feel for this.<br /><br />Love the movie; hate the subtitles debacle. Again: If you want to hear the theatrical subtitles being read, listen to the English language 5.1 audio. (I am using the 5.1 English audio. I can't vouch for 2.0. They may have botched that.)<br /><br />I'm hoping this situation won't lead to a Catch-22: They'll release DVDs with the original subtitles AFTER the pressing with the \\"bad\\" subtitles is sold out. But  few people want the bad subtitles! Are we going to be stuck with the incomprehensible English subs? Stay tuned horror/romance fans...<br /><br />Oh... make sure you watch until the closing credits start or you may miss an important last scene.<br /><br />Enjoy. This is a real gem. I wonder if this is the type of movie that inspires people to make movies?<br /><br />I love the understatement of this movie. No screaming and running around. A gentle, sympathetic vampire movie?

0316096199|3.0|I'm really ambivalent about this book.<br /><br />On the one hand, I understand the impulse & need to write through & past such an enormously life-changing experience.  On the other hand, I found myself skimming my way through chunks of the book about two-thirds of the way through because it just started to get disjointed & flat & jarring in some way that I just couldn't bear to read.<br /><br />The first 100 or so pages are excellent, especially if you can get past the first chapter - an excruciatingly detailed explanation of what happened to the author.  It's ironic that she notes at some point in the book that an essay she wrote for The New York Times Magazine about the experience was quoted in the \\"Trauma\\" part of a book on trauma & recovery & this inspired her to figure out more about what she needed to do to move forward - ironic because I think I'd still include her solidly in the trauma category & that makes me very sad for her & angry that this happens so often.
B001DJ7PR8|4.0|In his latest romantic escapade, \\"Vicky Cristina Barcelona,\\" Woody Allen, that wry purveyor of modern relationships, turns sexiness into a purely aesthetic experience.  Of course, that's not all that hard to do when you have a cast of drop-dead gorgeous actors exploring the fine art of love and lovemaking in a drop-dead gorgeous setting.<br /><br />The two main women in the story represent diametrically opposed views of love and men.  Vicky is the clear-thinking pragmatist who, when it comes to the opposite sex, opts for the stodgy and reliable type over the dashing romantic ideal - a preference reflected in her choice of fiance, the stuffed-shirt Doug, whose dutiful dullness makes him a perfect fit for Vicky`s middlebrow conception of domestic bliss.  Cristina, on the other hand, fancies herself more as the free-living Bohemian type, a gifted amateur photographer who prefers the more \\"dangerous\\" breed of man - one whose propensity for living life in the moment simmers just beneath the surface of a handsome appearance and a smoldering sexuality.<br /><br />When they travel to Spain for the summer, the two best friends almost immediately find themselves entangled in a complex romantic relationship with Juan Antonio, an abstract painter who inflames the women with his cultured temperament, his devil-may-care attitude, his smooth-talking ways, his raw animal magnetism and his Old World passion for life.  And as if all that weren't enough, we get a fourth ingredient added to the already spicy brew:  Maria Elena, Juan Antonio's beautiful, volatile and possibly mentally unbalanced ex-wife whom the artist has clearly never gotten over - and apparently never will.<br /><br />As always, Allen achieves a remarkable complexity both in his characters and in his view of how romantic and sexual attraction actually work.  This is reflected most intensely in the character of Vicky who, after a brief but sizzling encounter with Juan Antonio, comes to question her old willingness to settle for staid conformity and emotional security over all-consuming passion and romance.  This, of course, puts her whole future marriage in jeopardy as well as her friendship with Cristina, once the latter becomes the live-in lover of Juan Antonio.  But Cristina has problems of her own to contend with when an emotionally distraught Maria Elena pops up unexpectedly, taking up residence with the newly formed couple in Juan Antonio`s home.  With each additional twist of the plot, Allen brings new color and depth to his canvas, as now the complexities of Juan Antonio and Maria Elena's self-destructive love/hate relationship suddenly come racing to the fore.<br /><br />At times the emotions are so raw and close to the bone - and the truths about human relationships so pinpoint in their accuracy - that the movie becomes almost unbearable to sit through.  Or at least it would if the tone itself weren't so consistently scintillating and lighthearted and the setting so eye-popping and sensuous.  In fact, I predict that Barcelona - so richly photographed here by Javier Aguirresarobe -will be experiencing a tourism boom for years to come thanks to this film.<br /><br />Although Penelope Cruz earned a number of awards (including the Oscar as Best Supporting Actress) for her work as Maria Elena, all the actors in this film - Rebecca Hall, Scarlet Johansson, Javier Bardem, Patricia Clarkson and Chris Messina - deliver rich, outstanding performances.  And it may just be me, but the singsong, deliberately simplistic narration that Allen has attached to the story appears to be an homage of sorts to Truffaut`s \\"Jules and Jim,\\" probably the most famous romantic roundelay ever committed to film.<br /><br />The conclusion \\"Vicky Cristina Barcelona\\" seems to come to is that NEITHER approach to love really works in the long run - that while too little passion in a relationship may lead to a life of endless regrets over unrealized possibilities, too much passion can result in burnout, serial infidelity and mutual self-destruction for the individuals involved.<br /><br />Perhaps, Friar Lawrence's advice to the impetuous Romeo and Juliet - \\"Therefore, love moderately: long love doth so; too swift arrives as tardy as too slow\\" - was right after all.ruction for the individuals involved.

B0000D96NW|4.0|After Machine Head put out [[ASIN:B00005A46S Supercharger]], interest in the group had declined considerably from when the band had put out [[ASIN:B000O76PM6 Burn My Eyes]].  No longer were they the premiere groove metal band but rather a group of guys who did some rapping along with a cover of a Police tune.  Well, after they left Roadrunner Records, it turned out that no one would pick them up in the United States (they still had a deal with Roadrunner in Europe.)  They didn't present themselves as a group that was enthusiastic about what they did; they were instead players in the industry like anyone else.    As they started their descent into near-oblivion, the group parted ways with Ahrue Luster (who went on to play with Ill Nino...) managed to get to play a couple of shows with lead guitarist Phil Demmel, who was Robb Flynn's counterpart in his previous band Vio-lence.  Well, it didn't work out at first, so the band did some soul searching and began writing material.  Toward the end of it, Phil Demmel decided he wanted to be part of Machine Head and the group welcomed him in with open arms.    While other metal bands had fallen into the nu-metal influenced trap where guitar solos were being abolished, Phil Demmel's presence to an already legitimate group/producer combination not only put the band back on the map, but put them over the top as well (Robb Flynn has demonstrated the ability to be a legitimate singer/songwriter, Colin Richardson's one of metal's best producers, hands down, and Adam Duce and Dave McClain are severely underrated in their musical abilities.)  Their European popularity landed them back with Roadrunner in North America and they haven't had to look back since.    If you can get the North American version of this CD, good for you because it has the bonus track \\"Seasons Wither\\" and I consider that to be one of the best songs on the album.  I also liked \\"Imperium\\", \\"Elegy\\", and \\"In The Presense of My Enemies.\\"  However, I think that \\"Descend The Shades of Night\\" is hands-down the stand out track on this album.  It was absolutely moving and truly beautiful.  Given how \\"Farewell to Arms\\" was the last track on [[ASIN:B000N3ST9I The Blackening]], it only demonstrates that these guys know how to end an album.    The Blackening might be their magnum opus, but this definitely shows their path to redemption.  I highly recommend this album to metal fans everywhere.

B00000I8NC|5.0|Around 2001-2002, I started hanging out with more musicians who were more concerned about their art as opposed to which popular band they could emulate next.  I got into a few new groups during that time and got introduced to a few more than I would become a fan of later on.  However, there were two albums I was introduced to during that time that would ultimately shape my musical trajectory: Isis's [[ASIN:B00006IQHQ Oceanic]] and this release by Godspeed You! Black Emperor.      A guitarist friend of mine showed me this album because he thought I'd like it.  Once I got into the album, I was captivated and fascinated by the music.  It had the driving force of a rock band, but the added dimension of a string and percussion section filled the sound with a classical atmosphere that's still unseen by many others in music, let along the genre.  I ran out, grabbed this album, and showed it to my buddy who I've been in several band with.  He started crying once the buildup in \\"Moya\\" came to it's climax, proclaiming it was one of the most beautiful albums he'd ever heard.    The unintended plagarism in BBF3 notwithstanding*, this album is impressive and overwhelmingly original.  If you've come across this on Amazon and haven't purchased the album yet, this is one of those \\"must haves\\" for your collection.    *Footnote:  In the middle of BBF3, the band inserted a clip from an interview they conducted with a New Yorker/New Englander who called himself Blaise Bailey Finnegan III.  After letting off some anti-American sentiments, he read a poem which he attributed to himself.  After the album was released, it was brought to the band's attention that Blaze Bayley was actually Bruce Dickinson's replacement in Iron Maiden and that the overwhelming majority of the content in the interviewee's \\"original poem\\" were in fact lyrics to the Iron Maiden song \\"Virus\\" which can be found on their introspective [[ASIN:B00000IJPU Best Of The Beast]].
B00008CLOA|5.0|I was on to these guys early - 1967 - The Piper at the Gates of Dawn - still have the rather well-played and scratchy LP. At that time no-one predicted that the group would become as huge as it did. Although the album was successful in the UK (#6) it went unnoticed in the US (#131). Ironic then that over thirty years after it was released Rolling Stone would have it as 347/500 all time! As the years passed Floyd remained a mainstay in the UK album charts while in the US none of the group's subsequent six LP's cracked Billboard's top 50. This changed in 1973 with the release of The Dark Side of the Moon. Like Hotel California, A Stairway to Heaven and Thriller, Dark Side is much-played (perhaps over-played) music that never wears out its welcome with me. The years come and go, yet I never tire of this album. On Amazon.com there are 1202 Pepper reviews and nearly 1500 for Dark Side! Sales for the cd still approach 10,000 a week. Combined Canadian sales for all formats are estimated at 2 million - in a country of 35 million. The record has just 38 minutes of music, proving once again that we don't need to fill every cd with to its maximum 80 minutes.<br /><br /> For me Pink Floyd rather lost their way after Piper. Subsequent LP's wandered rather aimlessly hither and hither, a decent song or piece of music followed by meandering/experimental sections or songs that to my ear were more a collection of sounds than they were music. Picking my way through More, Atom Heart Mother or Ummagumma to find the worthwhile tracks was just too much like hard work. Dark Side was therefore a revelation. The band suddenly matured and the result was a brilliantly consistent album with one great song followed by another. There isn't a remotely weak track to be found. My recollection is that Dark Side was a collection of accessible prog-space-acid-psychedelic rock songs far more commercial in nature than anything that the band had recorded theretofore. However, today, if I really listen closely and analyze the music I realize that the music on Dark Side isn't that far removed from the music that preceded it on the LP's that I don't particular care for. A cake is a combination of eggs, flour, milk and sugar, mixed and baked. An edible cake has the right combination of ingredients, mixed in the appropriate order and for the appropriate length of time so as to create a batter of the proper consistency. The cake mixture is then placed in the oven at the correct temperature for the appropriate period of time. Pink Floyd always had the ingredients. They simply didn't have the rest of the equation worked out. With Dark Side the band learned that focus and superlative production (engineer Alan Parsons) does make a huge difference. The sound affects, rather than being just unrelated noise, become integral parts of the song. The songs no longer meander, as if searching for a conclusion - five on the album are under 4 minutes in length. The lyrics are interesting. This record was and remains an exceptional, once in a lifetime achievement that still sounds as fresh as the day it was released. Dark Side has always sounded tremendous, from record through to cd. However I cannot begin to describe how spectacular the reproduction is on this hybrid SACD.analyze the music I realize that the music on Dark Side isn't that far removed from the music that preceded it on the LP's that I don't particular care for.

1423101472|5.0|This is one hell of a series. The fifth and final book just adds to the greatness. In this latest entry Percy has to go on a special mission with his friend Bekendorf. While the mission is a success Bekendorf loses his life in the process. Percy receives the prophesy to which he has been waiting for years. Percy finds himself troubled when he finds out that he might have feelings for his friend Annabeth. Most of the last half of the book is a battle between the Titan lord Kronos's evil army and an army of young demigods. I found the ending a little anti-climatic but was left very satisfied when I finished the book. While reading you will come across many questions such as Is Percy going to choose his mortal friend Rachel over Annabeth? I hear that there is going to be a movie of the series directed by Christopher Columbus who made the first two Harry Potter films. I reccomend this series to everyone who reads. They are fun and fast paced and are hard to put down.
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|My title says it all.  The characters are intriguing and likable and the dialogue fits them all like a glove--good writing.  It's the only show I look forward to every week.  I'm busy but not so busy that I don't make time for Gibbs, Tony, Ziva, Timothy, Abbey, and Ducky.  Even the accessory characters are on the mark.  Good stuff  and very rare.  Thanks to those producers who bring NCIS home.
B000002O4S|5.0|excellent movie trilogy. excellent soundtrack.
0765348276|3.0|This book started out interestingly enough, with a good premise, but quickly degenerated into an unintentional comedy.  They say, \\"Write what you know,\\" but this author obviously doesn't know much about the military, warfare, or anything to do with combat arms.    The main character's drill instructor is a MasterSergeant, with this space age military apparently using current rank structure, this makes him an E-8, with the highest enlisted rank being E-9.  Sorry, the military doesn't use E-8's to train individual platoons.  Those are Sergeants and Staff Sergeants, (E-5's and E-6).    In his very first battle, he figures out the very obvious solution to killing the aliens when none of the hardened veterans of multiple battles with aliens can't, thus saving the day?  Gimme a break...    In his first couple of months of service, he's promoted from private to Captain because of his innate battlefield genious, all borne of his background as some advertising writer?  Gimme a break...    In one of the most amusing battles, our hero is pitted against alien humanoids that are all an an inch tall, and the best military solution to eradicating his dreadful foe, (in an age of instaneous space travel, nanotech armor and weapons that can meet nearly every need except actually protecting the soldier from being blown away by common projectiles, including rocks,) is to have the soldiers run around and stomp on their tiny human like foes, (which leads the hero into a great depression over the morality of war.)  Gimme a break...    The author's concept of normal conversation sounds like people who are constantly trying, (too hard by half,) to be clever and filled with high wit rather than people who actually possess these traits.    I got the kindle version, and it wasn't worth the money spent.  The only mildly redeeming aspect after an intriguing beginning was the unintentional humor    The characters are all comic book stereotypes, with about as much depth as your average comic book's thickness, from alien enemies to mankind's heroic defenders.    Some interesting concepts that fell flat due to a lack of imagination and even basic knowledge about the basic subject, (warfare,) the author is trying to write about.

B00006BSGZ|5.0|I give this DVD five stars because no one sang Carmen or Tosca like Maria Callas and this DVD shows us exactly why. On the other hand, fans looking for a great performance of the entire opera of Tosca should look to her '53 recording with DiStefano and Gobbi, conducted by Victor DeSabata. This doesn't come close. And that is saying a lot because this is pretty good. The problem is Carlo Felice Cillario's conducting isn't great and the acting by everyone other than Callas and Gobbi (who are phenomenal) is sub-par.      The 1962 aria portion is great even with Georges Pretre's sillyness at the podium. Maria sings \\"Tu che la Vanita\\" from Don Carlo, then the \\"Habanera\\" and \\"Seguidille\\" from Carmen. Pretre's treatment of other scores and his goofball antics aside, I think it's beyond argument that he knew what he was doing as far as Carmen. The same goes for Callas who is the epitome of Carmen.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|I recently watched all the Masterpiece Classic Dickens adaptations on PBS.  I had no idea what to expect with Little Dorrit, since I'd never read the book and I didn't have any idea what the story was about.  The length was daunting, and for that reason I almost didn't watch it.  But I'm sure glad I did, as it turned out to be one of my favourites (along with the new version of Oliver Twist).<br /><br />The cast, costumes, and look of the film were all wonderful.  From what I can tell, a couple of things were changed from the original book.  While these make this new production no less enjoyable, they were slightly confusing.  However, this shouldn't stop people from watching this lovely adaptation.

The camera always seems to be where you would want it to be, and they sound just as good live as they do on CD. The extra disc is forgettable but that aside this DVD is awesome!

B000TGJ80S|3.0|Bram Stoker' Dracula<br /><br />I recall when this first came out, it was billed as \\"a love story.\\"<br /><br />Well, I don't know about that.<br /><br />This film gives rise to a night creature who renounces God when he feels God has taken his wife despite courage in battle.  His pasty white skin, Hungarian-style accent, and the wide shadows that seem to pervade the friendliest of places creates a mood, a desire for blood and death.

B001BODXVW|4.0|Great effort for one half of SOAD. Very solid album, great songs, uncompromised lyrics; I liked a lot from first hearing. Also, the vinyl alternative I bought is pretty good recorded, a well pressed one. Maybe the only thing is that the voice (SOAD's guitarrist sings and plays guitar here) sounds kind of similar. This is relative because this is his way to sing, but is not as versatile as Serj's voice from SOAD. Give it a try.

Of course there are some inconsistencies with the original series (aka TOS), but that's to be expected when (spoiler:) there's a new timeline!<br /><br />Kirk is more than brash and a little bit self-destructive.  In the TOS and the films it was established he grew up with this father and eventually rose to the captaincy of the Enterprise.  In this film, his father dies early on, so without this support, he gets mean.<br /><br />Kirk gets into a fistfight at a bar, gets the snot knocked out of him and is persuaded by Captain Pike to become a recruit for the Academy.<br /><br />Incredible storyline.  Abrams is a genius.  Not only did he keep the fun and excitement of the original series but he expanded on it.  What if Uhura met Kirk early?  What if Chekov became a navigator on the Enterprise now rather than wait until Season Two?<br /><br />The Romulan changed enough history to change everyone's history.  The new crew is pressed into service by an emergency on Vulcan which becomes a turning point in not only the Vulcan mythos but in humanity's as well.<br /><br />Bright points:<br /><br />Delta Vega III, where we find Kirk stranded as a large red insect creature chases him.<br /><br />Dr. McCoy saying he's a doctor not an engineer.

B000SFZ05C|4.0|Great album, from start to finish. Is not their best work, but definively a very good effort. Ian's voice is strong as ever, and the riffing from Mr. Duffy is catchy and thunderous as always. The Cult is one of those bands with several years doing what they do that is still around, there must be a reason for that...... A must for any fan.
031606792X|1.0|So I was a huge fan of the first 3 and read each of them in less than 3 days. The first few chapters before the Jacob portion isn't so bad. In this books defense I've heard a lot of people upset because the sex wasn't more graphic but seriously it's a Young Adults book not a romance novel. My friend read this and now her 12 year old is reading them, do you want a 12 year old reading about graphic sex? NO! Anyways, back to my review. Boring, droning, I know she was under pressure to do something new, go out with a bang maybe. But she should've stuck to the old formula. GRADE: F! If I could rate it 0 stars I would!

1401307450|4.0|Okay so I adore John Frusciante & the Red Hot Chili Peppers and I heard this book was really good, so I figured that I would pick it up. It's not a great bio but a great book. PERIOD! Like everything I would take some of the stuff with a grain of salt but Kiedis does have an excellent memory for an ex-junkie (most of them can't remember anything) and it's not only entertaining it really lets you feel like for a brief moment in time your allowed in that ultra exclusive club that is superstardom. The only thing I can say negative is that it's very, this happened, then that happened. For instance, he talks about his relationship with Ione Skye and how she was this goddess and how he wouldn't be alive without her care and love. Then he goes on tour and you don't hear anything about her and he adds that he was having sex with groupies again because he and Ione broke-up. Almost like a footnote. He also talks about how he and John were great friends and then all of a sudden they weren't with no explanation of what happened or what he might have done wrong. I would seriously pick it up tho. Overall B
B000U0F7RG|5.0|I've never seen this show before on TV.  When I actually had a TV hookup (it's been 6 years now, no regrets) I would occasionally see the promos on the \\"WB\\" and think \\"Wow, this show sounds really Girly\\", so I never saw one episode.<br /><br />Then Amazon had the complete series on Gold Box and there were so many good reviews of the show, so I picked it up (I think it was around [...] bucks).  My friends on a fitness forum that I frequent all said that I wouldn't regret getting this set after expressed my reservations and they were right!<br /><br />What a great show!!!  The characters are very true to life and down to earth.  I'm through Season 5 at this point, I think and there hasn't been one episode that I haven't enjoyed.<br /><br />I actually didn't think that DH would be very interested in the show, so I started watching the series without him...he's seen enough of the show to want to see it, so this show is definitely not \\"just for girls\\" (like Sex in the City, for example).<br /><br />I love the packaging, it's really sturdy and in spite of my reservations with the cardboard DVD inserts, there have been no issues with scratching.<br /><br />Great show, right up there for me with West Wing, Freaks and Geeks, and all of my other favorite TV shows!

B0018M6J90|4.0|This is two movies - one of slight remembrance when Amy Adams isn't on the screen; a delightful one whenever she appears.  Starting with her breakout in [[ASIN:B000BYRCQU Junebug]], she's been among this country's finest actresses.  As testament, I had thought she'd won the part in [[ASIN:B0011U52EC Enchanted (Widescreen Edition)]] based on Junebug.  Nope.  That hadn't come out yet when 'Enchanted' was being envisioned.  She just went into an audition with 300 others and simply beat them out.<br /><br />Ms. Adams is a triple threat - acting, singing, dancing.  She's a veteran of dinner theater and comes from a large, performing family.  Her singing is on display in Miss Pettigrew.  Her rendition of \\"If I Didn't Care\\" is a real eye-opener for anyone who was unaware of her vocal talents.  I'm a Frances McDormand fan, no doubt, and she's in fine form here. But it's Amy Adams that makes this movie worth watching.

B001TH16DS|4.0|I am 57 and so grew up with Star Trek TOS on TV.  I found this new Blu-ray set to be fantastic.  However, there are some technical issues.  The toggle between the enhanced and the original did not work well on my system.  And the audio was a bit spotty from episode to episode. But all in all I am really happy I bought this and hope they continue to release all of the seasons of the original series.  Just saw the new movie today and having this DVD makes it all the better.
0060557818|3.0|In a classical sense, this book is a male rite of passage novel. It opens with Richard Mayhew being almost totally self absorbed with his life, a theme that continues almost until the end of the book. But Richard's \\"passage\\" which one could call his ordeal, begins when he bends down to save the Lady Door Portico who lives in London Below. This is when Richard's London Above disappears and he begins to see that the world is more than the sum of his own life. In this novel, Richard grows by doing for others via a quest that is about saving the life of Door, and some of her mystical friends. The ultimate objective of Door's is to continue her father's work of uniting the Londons, to which many of the evil characters in London Below are opposed. Richard does, indeed, become an unlikely hero, although the reader never fully likes him. The reader simply wants to. He is annoying. And yet Gaiman does this on purpose. As a man, or a woman, stretches and grows beyond what they believe is their capability, it isn't with gusto, enthusiasm, and full confidence. It is much more like Mayhew - with tentativeness and maybe not even with willingness. The human condition is such that adversity is what makes us stronger and wiser - maybe even by accident. And it enhances our world view. This is Richard's rite of passage and Gaiman handles it very well.  The book does move somewhat slowly, but you can't help but want to finish it.
1423101472|5.0|I picked up The Lightning Thief several years ago from a tiny bookstore in a little town I can't remember on my way to St. Louis with my husband.  It sat on the back corner shelf unnoticed. The clerk couldn't tell me anything about it, but it looked like the kind of book my middle school students might read.  I didn't see any sights on the rest of the road trip. I was in Percy Jackson's world and glad to be there.    My students and I love this book, love this series, and couldn't wait to read The Last Olympian.  They have been at my classroom door every day asking if I have received The Last Olympian yet. How many copies did I pre-order? Could they get on the waiting list?  Students who are now in high school rushed to my classroom each time there was a new release to show me their books as well. None of this is exaggeration.     This book is a bang-up ending to the series-the best one yet!  Mr. Riordan, thank you so much for your series.  It has ignited my students and made readers out of kids who said they hated reading.  One more thing: Do we get a hint of a new series to come?  After all, there's the prophecy(the seven?)and your use of the words \\"first series\\" in your acknowledgments. We hope we're right!     However, if we never have a new series, thank you again for ending this one so brilliantly.
B001DHXT2A|3.0|I was never into comic books or super heroes or any of that stuff.  I just never found it interesting as a kid so I wasn't going into this movie with high hopes or expecting a classic.  If anything, I expected another movie similar to King Kong, and well, that's sort of what the Incredible Hulk is.     A big jolly green monster jumping around through the streets with a nasty attitude that suddenly develops whenever he turns big and green and scary.  It's like you can't be big and strong with a positive and welcoming attitude.    He is more than capable of picking up vehicles and throwing them through the air, and that's also his main thing- picking up cars and slamming them down.  He does this quite a bit throughout the movie, and while I was already aware of his car-slamming techniques before watching the movie despite not knowing much about the Incredible Hulk character, it's good to know those little details were included in the movie.      Also, there was plenty of action that kept me interested, such as TWO mega hulks grabbing a helicopter with a hot woman inside and trying to bring it down.  They eventually did.    I knew there would be plenty of special effects and the film certainly delivers in that area.  Though one thing that kind of bugs me is how the regular guy keeps turning into the Hulk character while inside a dark area, so you don't actually see the transformation very often.  You almost do in one scene, and I appreciated that, but other than that one part I can't remember getting the opportunity to see him turn into the green monster.    So what do we have as a final thought?  Well, like I said, I don't know much about all these fictional character heroes, but this movie did keep me watching it until the end, something most movies fail to do these days.
B00006LLOG|2.0|It's no secret that Lou Reed was pining for commercial success and recognition long before this album was released. After the failure of the first two Velvet Underground albums to make an impact on a commercially and monetarily rewarding level, Reed softened his touch with the self titled third album. This meant that much of what was important about the Velvet Underground was thrown out, but there was still solid songwriting. Louis was still writing quality songs that he would have probably written anyway, they were just arranged and performed in a more user friendly way due to the absence of John Cale and Reed's desire for commercial success. He had not yet pandered to popular taste in a blatant effort to have a hit single and album and was at this time still only willing to meet the mainstream halfway. By the final VU album, Loaded, he had dropped this proviso and was now fully prepared to write commercial music to appeal radio stations and the average rock fan circa 1970. This is why Loaded is easily the weakest of the VU albums. What was unfortunate was that even Louis was fully prepared to sell out on the audience, the radio station, and the record label's terms, the first two still weren't buying. That changed in 1972 when Louis was taken under the boney wing of David Bowie, in the prime of his rock stardom at the time. Louis finally had the right connection, the right contact, and maybe most importantly, a scene to pander to, to bow, to sell out to. Unlike Frank, he didn't do it his way.    Bands such as the Kinks for example, who after having already tasted success and understanding the formula by which to maintain it, nonethless turned their backs on it in pursuit of more serious, intelligent songwriting and as a result made the best albums of their career (though certainly far from the most comercially successful). Radiohead achieved success on their own terms. They made the music they wanted to make and it happened that people really responded to it. Unlike these bands, Louis created music to fit with a ready made audience, the short lived Glam rock fad of the early 1970's spearheaded by Bowie. Without Bowie's patronage, I doubt very seriously that this album would have had the same impact. Many reviews at the time mentioned Bowie and Ronson as much if not more than Lou Reed. This  of course has to do with Bowie's celebrity, always much greater than Reed's, but also for the more legitimate reason that Ronson's touch is all over this record.     Lou's bisexuality has been well documented, although he has at times lied about this, preferring to pretend his homosexual relationships never existed which actually makes him seem even more of a contrived, fradulent hack on this particular album. I have nothing against homosexuals, but this album has gay themes running throughout it that are both tiresome and seem insincere. The gay image, Lou in make up, Lou with black nail polish, Lou singing about make up, were all designed to cater to Bowie's glam rock audience. Aside from that, excessive themes of gayness are just boring. Imagine making an album in which you referred to various aspects of your skin color throughout. It's equally daft and tedious.    The songs themselves are mostly weak and uninpisring. The vocals are perhaps the worst in Reed's career and that's really saying something. He seems to be going out of his way to sound camp on most of these tracks, which becomes annoying and embarrassing. Of course the hit, Lou's only one, \\"Walk on The Wild Side\\" is a fan favorite. In the catalogue of his work, it is not only not the best of his songs, it's actually not even good. It's poor. It's a second rate version of what Reed did much more effectively with the Velvets, observationalist songwriting. The same formula is here, but unlike songs with the Velvets or \\"Chelsea Girls\\" from Nico's first album, \\"Wild Side\\" is musically weak and obviously trying to hard to paint an explicit picture of the gay, junkie, drag queen scene Reed ecountered in his Warhol days. It is simply second rate compared to an observationalist song such as \\"Chelsea Girls\\" or the Velvet Underground's \\"Run Run Run\\", reinforcing my personal view that by the age of 30 Reed has already become a parody of himself. And not even a good one.    \\"Make Up\\" is probably the most embarrassing song on here. The most blatant effort to appeal to the audience Bowie has procurred for him.    \\"Hangin' Round\\" is almost as embarrassing. It's lyrically inane, but add the peculiar irony that Lou in his supposed wisdom and maturity is looking down his nose at the people doing the things he put down years ago. Given his speed addiction at the time (documented in Victor Bockris' Transformer biography) and penchant for simulating shooting up on stage, this track becomes laughable.    \\"Andy's Chest\\" and \\"Satellite of Love\\" are recycled songs from the Velvet era that that band had never released. This is something Reed did throughout the 70's and these like most, are superior in their original Velvet form. Seek those early versions out.    \\"Vicious\\" blithely bounces around until it wears itself out,  ultimately going nowhere. This is probably the best example of Reed trying to sound camp and looking instead like an a$$ clown of the highest order.      \\"Perfect Day\\" is the one highlight on here. I would advise fans to skip this album and instead pick up a compilation that will treat you to this and \\"Satellite Of Love\\" although unfortunately \\"Wild Side\\" will probably come included in the package.    In the aftermath of this release, Reed attempted to undo the damage this album had done to his credibilty by releasing the masterful \\"Berlin\\". This album though not on the level of the Velvet's musically, was his finest creation in terms of lyrics at the time (maybe still is). It was a rare occasion when the \\"story\\" form of a concept album succeeded. But not comercially. Now that Reed had a ready made audience (compliments of Bowie) he perhaps hefelt he could turn them on to the music he really beleived in, the music he really wanted to make. He was wrong. \\"Berlin\\" was largely condemned by both fans and critics alike and what followed, \\"Sally Can't Dance\\", an album that restored Reed to commercial prominence again causing him to quip (and I paraphrase) \\"This is great. The worse I am, the more it sells. Maybe if I'm not on the next one at all, it will reach number one\\". This was the sad state of Reed's commercial success. He still has acolytes due to \\"Transformer\\", who I'm willing to wager either don't know or can't stand his serious albums and he is forever obliged to play songs like \\"Wild Side\\" to expectant audiences. He built his house of fortune with straw and it was no surprise at all when it went up in flames.
B001R4MEYS|4.0|The \\"prog\\" versions of various styles of music always seem to be about ten to fifteen years behind.  When grunge was popular, prog-metal was suffering from an 80s hair-metal hangover.  Just now, we are starting to run across groups that successfully use the aesthetic of \\"Core\\"-era Stone Temple Pilots and early Soundgarden in a more experimental format.  Mastodon is one of them.  Previous to purchasing \\"Crack the Skye,\\" I had virtually no knowledge of Mastodon.  I purchased it on the suggestion of a friend well-versed in the ways of metal (thanks, James) and I was immediately pleased with it, not because I loved it right off, but because I found it compositionally interesting, dynamic, and energetic in a way that I knew would pay off on repeated listens.<br /><br />...and it has.<br /><br />\\"Crack the Skye\\" is apparently a concept album that stylistically follows more recent work in the genre.  It has a story, but the lyrics are too obtuse for the story to be clear - something about paraplegics, astral projection, and fighting Rasputin.  Other current conceptualists like The Mars Volta and Coheed and Cambria take a similarly impressionistic lyric approach to create obscure and subtle storylines.  Personally, I think that this is OK.  It is really difficult to write a \\"rock opera\\" without some tracks taking a dip in quality for the sake of clear storytelling.  I also don't think that there is anything wrong about creating a complex world in order to write a conceptually simple song.  Pete Townshend has always done this.  He had to create all of \\"Tommy\\" in order to write one clear song about child abuse.<br /><br />In listening to Mastodon, I found it helpful to remind myself: no music is truly original.  It all comes from somewhere, and Mastodon's work is no exception, although on \\"Crack the Skye,\\" their influences occur rapid-shot.  Increasingly, however, I am formulating the opinion that if I can readily discern five influences in a band's sound, they might be termed as \\"original.\\"  Mastodon easily meets this requirement:  too smart to be Queens of the Stone Age, but too blunt to be Tool, they are a prime example of post-grunge prog-metal - as if Soundgarden got cerebral after \\"Badmotorfinger\\" and collaborated with Ozzy to create a \\"Hemispheres\\" for the drop-tuning generation.<br /><br />This last comparison to Rush is, I think, purposeful and direct, by the way.  Aside from guitarist Brent Hinds intuitive Lifeson-esque histrionics, listen to the blatant \\"YYZ\\" quote at 6:00 in \\"The Last Baron.\\"  There is no way this is not a tongue-in-cheek reference.<br /><br />Although keyboards occasionally show up to add echoes of Emerson, Lake, and Palmer's classic overindulgence, classic guitar sounds overwhelmingly predominate \\"Crack the Skye.\\"  The organic nature of Hind's guitar solos harken back to the classic age of 70s guitar.  His work is melodic, inspired, and spontaneous.  Coupled with the thickly recorded rhythm work of Bill Kelliher, Mastodon's music seems highly angular, creating Frippy/Mars Volta-esque structures that mercilessly propel their music forward.  Even in the quieter moments of \\"Crack the Skye,\\" the listener is awash in rippling layers of movement, reminiscent of the tragically overlooked band Oceansize.<br /><br />THE LOWDOWN:  I had always kind of wished that the late 90s grungers would somehow transcend radio friendliness and get into some experimentalism.  Mastodon is obviously a group of musicians who took this influence and pushed it into a different realm.  Absolutely worth a close listen.todon easily meets this requirement:  too smart to be Queens of the Stone Age, but too blunt to be Tool, they are a prime example of post-grunge prog-metal - as if Soundgarden got cerebral after \\"Badmotorfinger\\" and collaborated with Ozzy to create a \\"Hemispheres\\" for the drop-tuning generation.

B001CD6FKS|1.0|I purchased the speed racer movie only to find out that the digital download had expired the day before. I could not reach anyone at warner brothers so I sent it back.Do not buy any Warner brother movies unless you find out when the downloads expire!
B000002540|5.0|OYFOOYK is one of the greatest heavy rock albums ever.  If you like it raw and relentless, get this album now.  But, as on their debut album, there is a song here that distinguishes BOC from the rest of the pack, and that is the soft, melodic Then Came the Last Days of May.  On the debut, this tune has a haunting quality that is simply mesmerizing.  Here, on OYF, Last Days contains what might be the most beautiful rock and roll guitar work ever recorded.  You can't help but be taken away by Buck Dharma's deep, feeling solo.   Own this CD for just this one song and it will be worth it.  Of course, you'll love all of it.  My only criticism of this truly titanic album is that it doesn't cover enough of BOC's great early songs.  All-time greats like Stairway to the Stars, Transmaniacon MC, Screams, Teen Archer and Wings Wetted Down should have been covered.  Much as I like I Ain' Got You and Born to be Wild, BOC simply had too much of a surfeit of great tunes to waste space covering other people's stuff.
0307455874|5.0|This is a great book. I was looking for a little more insight into our current presidents goals for his time in office, and it has really provided that. I liked his views before reading the book, and I respect them even more now.
B00158K0S8|3.0|Picture and sound quality were amazing. I loved the sound because the macrodynamics were right on - in other words, the explosions were really loud, and the dialog was not. This is how things sound in real life - none of this crap you see nowadays where the actors are passionately whispering to each other in the middle of a battle.   The movie sure did move along slowly, though. I thought it was a little boring.
0385486804|4.0|The book arrived quick and easy, thank you!  I liked reading the book, and usually I always like the book better than the movie, in this case it's actually different. The movie is so much better.
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|In order to get big rewards in life you have to take big risks.  If there is one thing that the Star Trek universe hasn't done in 20-25 years its take risks.  The franchise has suffered greatly for it, continuing to follow a formulaic approach that has made the franchise stale, predictable, and for quite a while... DEAD.  Not sick, not on life support, but D-E-A-D.<br /><br />Those days are over.<br /><br />The 11th feature presentation is quite simply the first GREAT Star Trek movie ever made.  While others in the series have been enjoyable, there was no definitive movie that stood out, nothing that could be pointed to as something unique, something special, something that takes RISKS.<br /><br />What you get here is the biggest risk that has ever been taken in the Star Trek universe in its 40+ years of existence.<br /><br />I will not ruin this risk but if you are a fan of the movies at all you will know it when you see it.  Being a long time fan of Star Trek (I am a Next Generation first and foremost) and having seen the trailer numerous times I figured out what was going to happen about 20 minutes before it did but that didn't stop the shock when I witnessed this awesome writing decision played out on the big screen.  The strongest of Star Trek lovers (especially TOS people) will no doubt have a lot of outrage at this risk but it was the right move to make.  The Star Trek franchise needed to be shaken up, it needed something fresh and it needed a movie to shock and awe the audience.<br /><br />Man did it ever deliver.<br /><br />This movie is an absolute JOY to experience.  Spock was always my favorite TOS personality as he probably was for most fans, but I never felt the connection to this cast that I did to Picard, Data, Worf and the Next Gen cast so I really didn't care what changes they made (and there is another major change that involves 2 characters that you never have experienced before in TOS history) if they were for the better.  In all cases these were for the better and executed with near-perfection by JJ Abrams (who might later be revered on the same level as Gene Rodenberry if this re-visioning [this is much more than a simple reboot] succeeds like I think it will).<br /><br />Since I don't like getting too deep into spoilers with reviews instead of focusing on the story (try your best to stay ignorant as possible of the story so its fresher when you see the film) I will instead focus on the characters we know so well (and some we don't).<br /><br />True To The Character We Know<br /><br />Spock (played by Zachary Quinto) - Even though Kirk (ahhem William Shatner) was advertised as the lead of TOS, the real centerpiece was Spock.  The work here by Quinto is beyond exceptional and complements the amazing work done by Leonard Nimoy the past 40 years.  Quinto plays the character as well as you could imagine and the real special thing in this movie is that finally (FINALLY) the half human side of Spock is heavily examined.  It is a major part of the movie and no doubt will continue to be focused on in future films.  Spock is no more or less important to the crew and story as he always has been.  Other actors could do lesser work (they didn't) but the movie franchise will only succeed as well as Quinto acts.  The character is in the best of hands.<br /><br />Bones (played by Karl Urban) - The gem of the entire movie without question.  Karl Urban takes the difficult role of playing not only Bones but Bones played by DeForest Kelley and is he ever amazing.  It's a complete joy to watch his character on the screen.  Urban doesn't need to do anything different in future films.  You can tell how hard he worked to keep the Bones character as he has always been and he hits a home run out of the park.  Wonderful wonderful wonderful<br /><br />Scotty (played by Simon Pegg) - We don't meet Scotty until far into the movie but Pegg does a great job doing James Doohan.  Since Scotty was always kind of the \\"middle\\" character onthe show where he wasn't wasted but wasn't the tops (Spock, Kirk, Bones) all Pegg had to do was do a good Scotty and hopefully the script-writers would give him more to do.  This is the case here.<br /><br />Revisions And Improvements Made<br /><br />Kirk (played by Chris Pine) - No longer do we get the ultra womanizing, overacting of Kirk/William Shatner but we get instead a focus on the risk-taking side of Kirk and this is the Kirk that I could truly learn to love.  Over and over again we see why Kirk in Star Trek canon is revered so much and his take no prisoners approach is put on the front burner all throughout this film.  Pine is confident and does a fantastic job.  I don't care how revered Shatner is, the writers got it right with this re-visioning of Kirk and it's thumbs up all the way.<br /><br />Sulu (played by John Cho) - Not much to say here.  Cho was fine but nothing amazing in his performance.  Sulu fights a little bit but hopefully more focus can be made on him in the future, no problems here but nothing jumps out.<br /><br />Uhura (played by Zoe Saldana) - As a communications officer her role is MUCH better in this re-visioning.  She is given more intelligent input by the script-writers but the one major canon change of Uhura (which I can't go into detail in this review) I am still trying to determine how I feel about.  Her mod is the 2nd biggest risk/mod taken in the movie.<br /><br />Complete Rewrite<br /><br />Chekov (played by Anton Yeltin) - Except for being Russian and making fun of his thick accent this is a completely new character and man was this a serious improvement.  Instead of the bumbling doofus that really doesn't do anything now Chekov is a ultra-young uber-intelligent officer that plays pivotal parts in the movie.  Yes this was a serious canon change but I can't imagine how any fan wouldn't approve because now you have a real character you can be emotionally attached to.<br /><br />New Characters<br /><br />Nero (played by Eric Bana) - Bana instantly becomes one of the main villains in Star Trek lore and in my opinion because of events in the movie he now becomes THE single villain in Star Trek history.  I wish Nero could have been on the screen more but with only 2 hours and so many people to get on the screen I think the right balance was struck.<br /><br />Old Friends<br /><br />XXX - You will know who this is when you see them.  I have no complaints other than one voice-over part where the narration seems a bit droll and uninspired but I also think this is because of the circumstance how they are speaking.  This old friend was a +++ to the movie and not just a ploy to get people in the seats.  A welcome addition to the movie and plot.<br /><br />Intangibles<br /><br />Bridge - The new bridge is the most gorgeous bridge you will ever see.  Some say it looks 'too sexy' or 'too bright' but THIS is how the bridge should have always looked.  Please please please don't change it for the future films.  You have already achieved the perfect look.<br /><br />Score - The one downside of the movie.  The 3rd trailer featured some of the most gorgeous background score ever and my hopes were very high.  The score that is featured in the movie is serviceable but doesn't inspire.  I was disappointed with the end result.  It's alright but it could have been so much more.<br /><br />IMO 'Star Trek' achieves what only 1 Star Trek movie (IV - The Voyage Home) came close to doing and that is being a successful film to the general public, not just Star Trek fans in general.  This is the quickest 2 hours you will spend this summer and an absolute joy.  I can see several movies being made with this cast and I hope several are made.  The events of this film make for a realistic approach to the original cast working anew in these new revisions.  As the movie ended I wished I could move ahead 2-3 years in time to see the next chapter and the next and the next.<br /><br />Everyone likes to rank the movies in order and I knew 1 hour in this was EASILY (note I don't even flinch when I say EASILY EASILY EASILY) the greatest Star Trek movie ever made.  You know a movie succeeds when a character or a movie itself feels like candy for the brain (last year Heath Ledgers Joker was the ultimate 'candy') and this is some yummy candy.<br /><br />If you are a Star Trek fan go see it and try to have an open mind for what you will see.  Many will be fine with the changes made.  For the ones that aren't would you rather have changes and new Star Trek movies or the same old same old that had ruined the franchise for so long (kudos to Rick Berman as the official murderer of ST)???  If you are just a person that loves movies you (yes YOU) can even enjoy Star Trek as this movie has been produced not just for the Trekkie but the every day Joe and Jane.<br /><br />***** HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATIONe villain in Star Trek history.

B001E2JNA6|5.0|The difference between the blue ray and standard dvd version is amazing. The scenery, costumes, color and detail are mesmerizing.  It is like watching a different movie. You feel like you are there. I highly recommend this movie in blue ray, you will not be disappointed.
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|I've seen them all.  I remember people complaining when Hollywood once thought of Richard Burton and Robert Redford commanding the Enterprise as Spock and Kirk.  Really!  \\"The Wrath of Kahn,\\" is still my favorite, though I thought the Picard movies were worthy efforts.  But this new movie is AWESOME!  That is an affirmative.    There are so many levels for this movie that appeals to both old and new fans.  For an oldie like me, I went with my younger son, and it was with relish that I recognized old members like Bones and Scottie, not to mention Sulu and Chekov when they were just starting out with Starfleet. The birth of James Kirk took my breath away, and the action is face paced, keeps you on your seat and nothing less of stupendous.  With all the visual effects that have become available in films today, you can get so caught up in them, they overpower the movie.  Not here.  There was just enough to keep you wanting more and not too much to become ah-hum boring.    The plot line held the story together well, which I won't divulge here, but many of you old timers already know some of the things that will happen because of previous story lines.  There is an interesting twist, again, I won't reveal, but it was as interesting seeing a young James Kirk in a vintage Corvette as it was to see a young Luke Skywalker in Star Wars I.    All the tricks were there, the cantankerous Bones, the Chekov enthusiasm of a 17-year old with more than a thick accent.  There is comedy too, and for you diehards who remember Kirk being the only one to defeat a simulated exercise, you find out who initially masterminded the no-win scenario Kobayashi Maru.     This is a movie I suggest fathers take their children, particularly if you are a Trekkie.  There are father-son moments between Spock and his dad, Kirk and the importance of his dad, and the camaraderie that develops between Captain Pike, the first captain of the Enterprise and Kirk.    I leave you with this.  When you come out of this movie, if you don't have a better understanding of talent, if you don't have a better understanding of friendship, if you don't have a better understanding of how this franchise has existed for over 40 years, then you are dead, and don't understand the difference between \\"Good Luck,\\" and \\"Live love and prosper.\\"  The best feel good movie I've seen lately.  See it today!  The go again to make sure you understand why this franchise will never die.
B000AQBAUI|4.0|These guys played hard, bluesy, riff based rock, late 60s-early 70s style. They are heavy and loud, and their riffs are chunky and drop like a hammer.<br /><br />They are not as inventive as Led Zeppiln and not prog-tinged like early Deep Purple. Yet their guitar playing is great, and these are truely loud, metalic songs.<br /><br />For the standards of their era, this was some of the hardest rock out there. It's hevey edge stands up perfectly today. Absoulutely enjoyable album, that can shread the paint from the walls, 40 years on.
0385340990|5.0|This book is one of the best I have ever read.  The reader gets to know the residents of Guernsey both in the past and present, during and just after World War II.  I felt drawn to the characters.  I cared about their situation, which was not an easy way to live.  You were forced to learn what happened during their Nazi occupation and cried and laughed with them.

B001UREJWM|2.0|boring.    This sounds very similar to the past 2 or 3 Dio works; the songs are plodding, the lyrics redundant, but the production and cover art is nice. I of coarse loved Heaven and Hell and the Mob Rules, didn't like Dehumanizer and this new disc is about like the latter, just uninspiring. I recognize they have been around forever and a day and while I think the playing is certainly adequate the material is just very very flat and not worth a purchase, the sad part is I just can't see it ever changing. IMO DIO is finished.. and has been finished at least since Angry Machines and his voice just sounds different, almost grating.. no wait, it is grating. There have been bright spots here and there but this isn't one of them.    And for Heaven sakes, what's with the name? You're Black Sabbath, changing the name changes nothing.
B001TODCII|4.0|The movie is good for sure. But what I did not like is the Hero of the movie who saves his daughter went all things as planned by director or him with out any exceptions. The director should have created some opposite force to oppose him or challenge him. Any ways, go watch it. You may not be disappointed<br />Cheers<br />Kiran
0240810961|5.0|This is a wonderful book that works on many levels: as drawing lessons for animators, of course, but also as a historical document, and as a fascinating glimpse at sketches and unfinished drawings from many classic Disney animated features. Stanchfield's thoughts on drawing are unusual, original, and thought-provoking, and they'll help you learn to be a better artist no matter what your speciality.    There are a few spots where an editor's notes could have added a lot to the main text; explaining the identity of various mysterious personages, for example. It's also a shame that the many sketches from the author's original notes couldn't have been reproduced more clearly.

B00005J9M2|5.0|I had purchased this album once and lost it. Then came the expanded edition and finally I added it back to my collection, and what an addition it made. This PSBs at their best with the latin melodies they so flawlessly blended into their signature. From the booming drumlines to the soothing guitar notes this album is great to just sit back and listen to than dance around with. This expanded edition is hard to find but well worth the search.
1933382880|5.0|This is the BEST of Paul Auster!!  Moody, mysterious, deep and VERY disturbing.  What wonderful short novellas are contained in this edition.  This is one of the MUST HAVE fiction series for Paul Auster fans.  If you don't know him, get to know his writing through \\"The New York Trilogy.\\"  There is NOTHING else like this!!
B001UREJWM|1.0|Anyone who has taken Benadryl, or a similar antihistamine, is familiar with the droopy-eyed, gravity-feels-like-it-has-doubled drowsiness that occurs with such meds.  This album sounds like the band took heavy doses of Benadryl while composing and recording the album.  I blame this on Ronnie James Dio who in past years gave us Dio: The Benadryl Years starting with \\"Lock Up The Wolves.\\"  Can this really be the same group of musicians that gave us Black Sabbath's \\"Mob Rules\\" and \\"Heaven and Hell?\\"  One more thing.  I have been a big fan of heavy metal for over 25 years and I am a Christian (and a pastor at that!).  The album cover is offensive.  Imagine the outrage if the Crosses were replaced by the star of David or the Muslim's cresent moon and star.  Dio really needs to get over his issues with Christianity.  If you'll excuse me, I am going to go listen to some Dream Theater or maybe some Nightwish.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I think all of the books are really good. I read all of them in 1 week, I haven't seen the show yet but I want to. I know when I get my DVD's I will be glued to the tv and I can't wait. So sorry to my kids and my husband until I'm done with them.  For all of them people out there that don't like the show don't watch it. If that's the way you feel about it, try reading the books, don't you know the books are always better any ways.   That's just like with Twilight people didn't like the movie or the books. Well keep it to yourself because we don't want to here about how it.  We love these books and the show and I'm sure were all going to keep on reading them and watching it.
B001U0HBPQ|5.0|I loved this movie and it stayed with me for a long time; finally bought it.  It has a lot to say about life and how temporary things are.  It is in stages humorous, as in Benjamin's early days, gentle, sad, and ultimately very thought provoking.  I don't think Brad Pitt got enought credit for his acting in this and the movie was overshadowed by Slumdog Millionaire, but it is definitely worth spending the time to watch it.
B001F0WXY0|5.0|I'm not usually excited by sci-fi, but this book is a tapistry of religion, politics, behavior, spirit, etc.

B001T30232|5.0|From the moment I read previews of this book, I knew I was going to love it.  It was everything I hoped and so much more.  Enzo, the family dog, is the narrator of the family's story.  He's a philosopher as well as being his owner, Denny's best friend.  Denny is a semi-professional race car driver who has a special talent for racing in the rain.  While other driver's wipe out, Denny wins the race.  This art for negociating life's troubled times becomes a  metaphor for the whole novel.  The family has happy times as well as some very dark days, but Denny makes it through with the help of his best friend, Enzo.  This story has it all from laughter to tears.  And there is a wonderful, uplifting epilouge.  I'm a librarian and have put this book in dozens of patrons hands and they have all have loved it, too.  Highly recommended and not just for animal lovers.........a great story for all audiences!
B000A2H2TK|3.0|I was initially quite disappointed in this release back in '77. I regarded it is a total abandonment of virtually everythin GG stood for. \\"Disinterested\\" would best describe my feelings for this album for the past two decades. After viewing this CD on Amazon recently I recalled actually liking a couple of songs and when the price was right I decided to give it another go.     'Two Weeks in Spain' is a funky and catchy piece that I was always accepting of. It could have appeared on any number of earlier GG albums. 'I'm Turning Around' is a melodic yet lightweight number that would be better suited for a Phil Collins era Genesis record (WIND AND WUTHERING or AND THEN THERE WERE THREE). 'I Betcha Thought We Couldn't Do It' is an uncharacteristic basic rocker that never shocked me as it did so many others. 'Who Do You Think You Are' is a generic and disposable R&B influenced track as is the following 'Mountain Time' which sounds more like Little Stevie Winwood (Spencer Davis era) than anything GG should be wasting their time with. 'As Old As You're Young' is classic Giant. 'Memories of Old Days' lies somewhere between older Giant and the lighter sound of 'I'm Turning Around.' It's definitely a couple of minutes too long but doesn't sound noticeably out of place. Although more of a straight ahead rocker 'Winning' possesses just enough off-kilter quality to be an acceptable GG song that could perhaps have appeared on an earlier record (albeit a weaker track). 'For Nobody' falls along the same description as 'Winning,' not a great song but decent and not too far off the Giant beaten path. Finally, the added track 'For Nobody (Live)' adds nothing.     Not a bad record. Three and one half stars.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|I recently went to the stage play 'Cats' and sat in an upper row.   The visibility was great, but I had trouble hearing all the words and music because of the audience noise.   Now I can watch it 'up close', and not only see it all, but hear it all.   A great follow up, and a great way to remember an enjoyable evening.   I recommend it.
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|The original Star Trek was one of my all time favorite shows but I could never get into the later incarnations. I gave the Next Generation a season or so before losing interest but completely skipped the other series'. It was the movies that I loved the most and I watched all of them in the theater except Nemesis which only managed a rental. Good choice because it was terrible. In fact there hasn't been a decent Star Trek movie since First Contact thirteen years ago. Whew. In the meantime Star Wars has produced three horribly flawed movies that have raked in the cash for George Lucas. Recent reboots of the Bond and Batman franchises have been absolutely spectacular but can Star Trek rebuild itself from the wreckage of Nemesis?<br /><br />My biggest fear was that the new Star Trek movie would be all sound and fury with no substance. I didn't like the preview featuring a preteen James T. Kirk driving a 1960's muscle car at a cliff before jumping from the vehicle. Was this Star Trek or the next Fast and Furious film? Let me cut to the chase and say that I loved this film and my wife who doesn't know a Klingon from Cling Wrap enjoyed it greatly. The casting was excellent but Zachary Quinto stood out for his amazing portrayal of a younger Spock. It was as if Quinto was born for this role. The movie features some outrageous space battles that rival anything Star Wars was producing but it doesn't reach the level of headache inducing as some recent films do. Nero's enormous Romulan spacecraft is something fans REALLY need to see on the big screen. One effect that I've never seen before is the constant use of light flares on the screen. The filmmakers really seem entirely too taken with lighting effects and I'm still not sure whether I like it or find it irritating.<br /><br />The writers did what I felt for years needed to be done. Stop using the television actors and create an all new cast specifically for the movies. I never felt that the Next Generation actors had the gravitas to support a big screen feature which may explain why the last two movies felt like extended episodes. Going back to Kirk, Spock and McCoy is a great idea and the writers did something rather clever. Because of events in this movie the characters have now become detached from the television show timeline meaning the writers have full freedom to write as they please. You could theoretically have events directly contradict the TV show and still be consistent. Alright, you probably have to see the movie to understand what I'm saying but it was a very good idea.<br /><br />I expected the noise and bright lights but I was surprised that the movie's script had some actual depth that I haven't seen since Picard's, `The line must be drawn here' speech from First Contact. Although I rip on Nemesis, Insurrection may have even been worse because it just sat there stirring nothing. In fact the new Star Trek's opening actually put a sizable lump in my throat. I am so glad to see Star Trek back and based on early box office returns it looks like the series will be around for awhile longer, in fact it might just  live long and... well... prosper.avitas to support a big screen feature which may explain why the last two movies felt like extended episodes.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|I read about this game in Wired magazine and decided that it would be fun to try for a family game night.  Since everyone stays in the game to the end AND it doesn't last more that 90 minutes, it sounded like it would be a good group activity.  I also got the 5-6 player extension which was necessary for our family night group.  Our family group is really a mixed bag, so it was going to be a real test of the game.<br /><br />Family night was my two adult kids (22 and 23 years old), their significant others (one Nerd guy and one fashionable girl) and my wife and I (both in our early 60's).  My daughters boyfriend had played the game once before, which really helped in the setup and getting started. My wife and I had taken the online instruction that is offered (only takes about 15 minutes to go through.)<br /><br />The six of us had a really fun time and got to know each other.  This is a great game for almost any group.  Everyone found it interesting and entertaining.
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|As I can say based on my personal moviegoing experience, this movie is a delight for Star Trek fans (me) and neophytes (my girlfriend) alike. It's beautifully paced, the relative unknowns do a great job inhabiting characters so familiar to our pop culture landscape, and it retains enough of its original charm while infusing the series with new life.<br /><br />To those who complain that the alternate reality story \\"destroys\\" everything you love about Star Trek, try to remember that this is a work of fiction, none of it has ever actually happened, and J.J. Abrams is not going to break into your house and destroy your Wrath of Khan DVD. I think Leonard Nimoy's presence accentuated the fact that this movie represents a passing of the torch -- it's a way to give a young Enterprise crew a new set of adventures. Some fans, no matter what the series, will never be happy no matter what. Don't let the most fanatical segment of them keep you from this great movie.
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|My review of Star Trek XI.<br /><br />I LOVED IT SO MUCH. I loved it so much. I. Loved. It. So Much. It was fun, had an attractive cast that played the story and characters so well.. and it just looked really cool. As a fan, I can tell you that it was a really awesome movie to experience in the theater and it made the kid in me grin from ear to ear. It did not disappoint me in any way. It was so fresh and crisp looking. The computer graphics and effect shots were so clean and realistic without being so completely over-the top.. aside from where they needed to be ;) It followed certain \\"sci-fi rules\\" and kept it original while sticking to the core and essence of what the original 1950's series was about. In short, It was great.<br /><br />I know that many people will dispute the exuberance I may be displaying with this review of the film, but as a fan, I felt like it was finally due - a great Trek film... and here it was, I am going to see it in the theater again... and maybe again. It started my weekend off right!
B000IAZ6W4|5.0|Patrick Watson is amazing, I love just about every song on this album. I would describe most of the music as dark and dreamy. I've sorta got a fetish for that kind of stuff. Just perfect.
B00005JPUN|4.0|This was quite a good movie. Good characters, decent acting and nice, engulfing action.<br /><br />It stars Nicole Kidman, a psychiatrist(?) who has to deal with an epidemic spreading around her. She tries to shield her kid and herself from the dangers that are around every corner.<br /><br />Once people start getting infected, the worry for her son Oliver, who spends an enormous amount of time away from his mother (Kidman) only grows.<br /><br />This movie features people catching a virus that ultimately, after you fall asleep, creates extra skin all over your body, especially in the face area and makes you almost unrecognizable. That was probably the nastiest part of this story.<br /><br />I did like, however, how amongst all of the \\"zombies\\" were people who weren't infected and helped Nicole's character along the way. They were few and far between but it gave you hope.<br /><br />All in all, I think this movie is underrated.<br /><br />B-
B000002UAX|5.0|Great album by the best band in the world! The Discs were delivered quickly and it sounds great! Thanks so much and we we will be doing business again.
B001K3JF7K|2.0|I've been a big fan of Diana Krall's since I first happened to see her on a late-night TV appearence ca. 1995, when my reaction was \\"who's THAT\\"? I love her serious straight-ahead piano chops and her mellow voice and  musicianship.     So it pains me to say that I really have to agree with a number of others who've posted their reviews! This album is a REAL snoozer, and after one listening I really regretted having run out and bought the CD. This album is disappointingly bland; I like some strings here and there on arrangements, but this is way too string-heavy. And what's with the excessive breathiness in her singing this time out? It verges on that really annoying French tradition of female vocalists from the 60's-70's a la Brigitte Bardot (and most recently displayed by the Mrs. Sarkozy on her vanity album--UGH!!) I hope that in the future, Diana goes back to her small small ensemble or big-band efforts.    So save your money, and if you're interested in a female pianist/vocalist, check out Eliane Elias instead, as others have suggested. I highly recommend her \\"Eliane Elias Plays Jobim\\" (1990). And now I'm feeling eager to check out some of Eliane's more recent albums!
B000092T56|5.0|Frida is a film to be enjoyed with all your senses. The acting, the directing, the music and the costumes are fabulous. A highly recommended viewing.
B00001OH7O|5.0|Hunky Dory being Bowie's 1971 release and his 4th studio album starts out with a bang with \\"the amazing track \\"Changes\\", and another great track is \\"Life on Mars?\\". The booklet has many fine photographs of Bowie posing in  many outlandish outfits. It also contains all the lyrics and we also get a list of whom plays what on the album. 5/5.
0312427999|1.0|After reading Klein's book, I have become highly skeptical of free markets. Not because her arguments were decisive, but because the free market made it possible for such a low-quality book to be published and bought by millions.<br /><br />This is not to say that Klein does not have her moments. When she documents governmental abuse of power, she is usually spot-on. The war in Iraq was a mistake and did indeed enrich Bush's and Cheney's corporate friends, Pinochet was a brutal tyrant and torture is never justified, and the CIA should not have interfered in the domestic affairs of sovereign countries.<br /><br />Yet, Klein's ignorance when it comes to economic matters overshadows any good that might have come out of this book. All too often, she dismisses Chicago school economics out of hand rather than seriously interacting with the scholarly claims that it makes. I was appalled too see that, in her treatment of Bolivia's hyper-inflationary episode, she appeared to advocate deficit spending by the government. To pay for such spending, Bolivia's government would have had no choice but increase the money supply, thus further fueling inflation. While the \\"shock\\" approach is clearly detrimental in many cases, inflationary episodes are one of the few situations in which a radical commitment to swiftly decrease the money supply and restore fiscal balance is the best course of action.<br /><br />Throughout the book, one will discover that Klein lives in a world without trade-offs. Thus, the only effect of rent control and the minimum wage is to make housing more affordable and raise the wage of workers. No mention is made of the fact the the minimum wage increases unemployment and that rent control creates a shortage of housing and lowers the quality of housing units. As most of her readers will be under the age of thirty, they will likewise be oblivious to the fact that Nixon's wage-and-price controls policy, of which Klein speaks approvingly, were widely resented by thepopulation and led to massive shortages.<br /><br />Similarly, any serious student of Hayek would disagree with Klein's portrait of the Austrian scholar as a dogmatic proponent of laissez-faire. In the Road to Serfdom, Hayek specifically states that social security and work-hours regulation do not lead to serfdom and warned against a \\"wooden insistence on [...] the principle of laissez-faire capitalism\\". Johan Norberg's \\"Defaming Milton Friedman\\" in Reason also documents how Klein misunderstood or misrepresented Milton Friedman. It is ironic that Friedman, who famously opposed the conscription and denounced it as slavery, is portrayed in Klein's book as a staunch supporter of totalitarian governments. As far as I remember, Klein also passes over the fact that, in 1980, Friedman criticized Chile's authoritarian ruler (\\"Chile is not a politically free system and I do not condone the political system\\").<br />In her treatment of developmentalism, Klein should also acknowledge that there are cogent criticisms of import-substitution industrialization. First, it presumes that the government has a special ability to identify which industries should be supported. Yet, as Hayek argued, a central planner is always faced with a knowledge problem. Public Choice theory has additionally shown that the political process can be unduly influenced by special interests. Second, Klein never refutes the idea that each country should specialize in what they have a comparative advantage in. In her personal life, Klein seems to apply this principle. At the end of the book, she acknowledges that she received help from numerous research assistants. In other words, she focused on what she had a comparative advantage in (writing the book) and outsourced other tasks. Third, it is never a all-or-nothing situation. The choice is not between a libertarian state and developmentalism. It is perfectly conceivable to have free trade and redistribute the resources that were saved thanks to specialization. Finally, in a book that is highly critical of big business, it is paradoxical that Klein would support ISI, which, first and foremost, benefits big business (i.e. the upper-classes). By sheltering local industries from foreign competition, ISI enriches local businessmen who, in Latin America, are part of the oppressive elite.<br /><br />What truly saddens me is that this book will be read by people who have no grasp of basic economics and, instead of promoting real solutions to poverty, it will offer them nothing but a pipe-dream. Like Friedman and Sachs, Klein has a planner mentality. She is the quintessential \\"(wo)man of system\\" that Adam Smith denounces in the Theory of Moral Sentiments. Not only would most of her views be detrimental to the economy, implementing them would also require coercion (whether it is the business elite or the common people who are bullied into submission matters little to me - coercion is bad regardless of whom it is used against). \\"Piecemeal democratic reform\\" should be preferred to \\"utopian social engineering\\" (to use Karl Popper's terminology). What Klein (and Friedman) proposes is the worst kind of social engineering, which assumes that it is possible to reorganize society as if people were pawns on a chessboard.<br /><br />I was distraught when I learned that this book was required reading in college classes, as it is a prime example of dishonesty (see for instance her tally of public and charter schools in New Orleans; the schools were counted six months apart!] and lack of academic rigor. I would suggest readers who are serious about poverty and growth to buy one of Bill Easterly's books instead.
0446691437|4.0|Easy to read, beautiful descriptive passages.  I passed it on to my son, a musician. It is beneficial to anyone.
B000002AP1|1.0|I went shopping for some tapes at the local thrift store. Some dopey looking teenager was working there and asked if I was looking for anything. I said \\"Yeah, do you have any cool punk tapes? Like a Good Charlotte bootleg?\\" and he just laughed. He said \\"Girl, this is real punk!\\" and handed me some tape with a tranny on the cover called \\"Raw Power\\". It was only 25 cents so I bought it. And YUCK! This album is pretty much as run-of-the mill as you can get. Nothing special about this album at all. Real punk is Green Day's \\"American Idiot\\", not this untalented crap made by ProTools. Don't listen to it, EVER.
B001QWBM62|5.0|Hey Amazon,  Everything went fine, but...  The seller had two offers with the same price- one was just the recorder and the other one was the recorder +extras(sd card etc...).And that's where I got a little bit confused and unfortunately ordered the one offering just the recorder.Of course I can only blame myself, but still I find it a little tricky.    Regards  Kuba
B00005JKGK|5.0|If you have read the book, you will love this screen adaption of the Joy Luck Club. I count it as one of my Top Five favorite movies if not my Top One movie. It is timeless classic. Besides the two times I saw it in the theater, I have watched it first on VHS and again on DVD more times than I can count. It doesn't give the best view of Asian men, was that a personal view of writer Amy Tan, who married a Caucasion? The ending always chokes me up. Great casting, great writing, great producer and director. 6 stars out of 5!
B001LOU6ZS|4.0|Mechanix was in my humble opinion a make-or-break effort.  The band decided to just sort of let nature take it's course and the rest is history as they say.  \\"Mechanix\\" may not be their strongest effort but it is well worth having in your collection and gets 4 stars due to making changes yet not changing anything.  There was some fine tuning done but the overall UFO sound still remained intact.  I think the title was very fitting as well.  And the remaster effort is also very good.  Every now and then something will be remastered and actually sound worse than the original cd.  Not in this case.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|I recommend this film to anyone who has lost their sense of humor due to family issues...Great Fun, lots of laughs.  Brit humor at its best.
B001KP2Y3K|5.0|Madeleine Peyroux's golden tones, perfect pitch and excellent articulation<br />are sure to make Billie's ghost smile.  This is her best album ever because it is her original material and that gives it a genuine flavor that is communicated deeply in each track. I highly recommend it. It isn't hugely different in style from other albums, but why mess with perfection?
B001TODCII|4.0|It's very suspenseful. The action is non-stop. The emotion is raw.    The dialogues between  Bryan Mills and his wife are heart-wrenching and bitter even though they did not talk with each other much. Most of the times, his wife blamed him of neglecting his family. He did not answer to these words but I saw pain on his face.    The weakness of this movie is it has big logical holes. For example, in one of the scenes, Bryan was handcuffed to a pipe. Yet he somehow, swiftly and miraculously disengaged from the pipe and killed the bad guys.    Overall, it's rivetingly entertaining. It's the first good movie I've seen in 2009.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|Very impressive album; I won't say that all songs impressed me equally, but Hurt and We'll meet again would be enough to merit 5 stars. And then there's \\"The Man comes Around\\", one of the most powerful religious songs I have ever heard, equal to the most profound performances by Mahalia Jackson...<br /><br />Cash sounds deep, wise and full of pain and these impressions will haunt you and make you want to repeat this CD over and over again (and make you repeat some of its moments in your head).... It hurts at times to listen American IV, but it is a noble sensation.
B000N6TX1S|3.0|\\"Children of Men\\" was film of the year for me. It was clever, thought-provoking, action-packed and brilliantly acted by seasoned performers. Particularly amazing were the two chase scenes that were filmed in one continuous shot. So you would think that if the filmmakers went to the trouble of releasing a two-disc edition of the film, they would explain how those two key sequences were filmed. Wrong.    Instead, much of the space that could have been devoted to this was wasted on the verbal meanderings of ... Slavoj Zizek, an over-earnest \\"cultural theorist\\" who had nothing whatever to do with the making of the film. Zizek is one those fashionably oblique academics given to making sweepingly counter-intuitive statements in broken English. My favourite is his definition of a good film:    \\"It simply make reality the more what it already is\\".    On and on he drones, chicly quoting Hegel while explaining that \\"the film gives the best diagnosis of ideological despair of late capitalism\\" or that the movie instantiates \\"the paradox of what I would call anamorphosis\\" (as opposed to \\"what I would call the paradox of anamorphosis\\"). At one point he refers to Michelangelo's \\"David\\" as \\"a statue of Michelangelo or whatever\\". But what else should we expect from the man who recently appeared on \\"Democracy Now\\" to declare that \\"let's everybody in the world, except US citizens, be allowed to vote and elect the American government\\"? Sigh ...    So: caveat emptor. The movie itself is truly brilliant, but the second disc is a let-down. I didn't want to hear a block of \\"theory\\": I wanted to know more about the making of the film. I suspect that others who really adored this film feel the same way. That means the two-disc edition loses two stars for me.
B001GCUO1G|2.0|Every time I saw bits of footage from X-Men Origins: Wolverine... Before its release--I would come away feeling not all that excited...Which seemed strange since I generally liked all 3 films from the X-Men trilogy.    Given those feelings though and the whole leak thing--I was not planing to see this one in theaters...But an opportunity presented itself--and I thought \\"What The Heck\\"...My instincts proved very much corect...    The film opens in 1845 where a young James Logan (Troye Sivan) makes 2 shocking discoveries about his family bloodline, First that he has a brother (Michael-James Olsen)--and that they both have strange mutant powers to heal at a rapid rate...    We see the mutant siblings battling side by side through two world wars and Vietnam conflict-- where they are sentenced to death for killing a commanding officer...Having obviously survived...Logan (Hugh Jackman) and his brother Victor Creed (aka Sabretooth, Liev Schreiber) then are recruited to join a top-secret government task force.    But as their targets begin to include innocent civilians, Logan 's conscience forces him to flee to the Canadian Rockies, where he builds a home with a schoolteacher Kayla Silverfox (Lynn Collins).    Informed by his old commanding officer William Stryker (Danny Huston) that the old team is being killed off one at a time.    Logan is devastated when Victor finds and kills Kayla.    A vengeful, Logan agrees to take part in an experiment that will fuse his bones with a powerful metal alloy called adamantium, which makes him virtually indestructible and gives him the strength needed to defeat his powerful brother. Betrayed by Stryker, Logan (now Wolverine) sets out to find Victor...    Along the way, he meets and is joined by fellow mutants like John Wraith (Will i Am) and Remy LeBeau (aka Gambit, Taylor Kitsch). Ultimately Wolverine must battle with Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds)    We know going in the end of the movie lead into the events of Bryan Singer's first X-Men flick--and while there's action aplenty here--the narrative getting there is a disjointed mess most of the time.    Director Gavin Hood, writers David Benioff and Skip Woods along with editors Nicolas De Toth and Megan Gill contributed to the \\"cut and paste\\" feel of things At one point--I even felt like I was watching a scene from executive producer Richard Donner's Superman--as Logan is taken in by an elderly couple who live on a farm. Not sure if that's from Wolverine mythos--if it is apologies--if not then it just felt like another excuse to see more of Jackman's physique then we need to.    Mutants are introduced and then quickly dealt out of play--So that we can see the next action set piece.    Jackman saves himself by just being Wolverine--I thought Huston was gteat as Stryker. Schreiber as Victor/Sabretooth was OK but I wanted to see how he becomes Tyler Mane's Sabertooth from X1    There is one nice surprise near the end of the movie but by then...A sequel is already being planned as well as a spin-off for Deadpool....Better luck next time.
B0011NVC9I|5.0|what great movies are made of. it floored me after seeing it. very engrossing - great use of technology- great story

0345495004|5.0|Mamah was a woman before her time--educated, independent, married later in life (about 30), and wise enough to realize she would be miserable staying in her marriage, especially for the sake of her children---considering it was 100 yrs ago, what a brave and courageous person she was!  Thirty five years of age is a difficult time for women, as they supposedly reach their sexual peak and hormones are raging. Therefore, I am not surprised at her actions and I do not fault her. I believe she and FLW were true soulmates. Nancy Horan made Mamah come alive in this well researched book and I feel nothing but admiration and affection for Mamah, and sorrow at her untimely demise. This book would be a great movie if done correctly, either for PBS or the big screen.
B000053VAZ|5.0|Love this sweet, sweet movie - honest and true love story.  Shipping was good and movie arrived in condition promised.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|If you haven't seen this series get a copy of this DVD any way you can - beg, borrow or steal it.  This is a lesser known Dickens tale masterfully adapted for the screen.  A timeless rags to riches to rags tale that runs the full gauntlet of human emotions and is filled with characters from every walk of life.  The cast, acting, sets, cinematography and editing are all absolutely first class.    This is not ever going to be a pop culture favorite but if you enjoy classic drama you will be hard pressed to fine anything any better.  The story is fairly complex given it has so many characters whose lives are intertwined but the use of flashbacks helps keep the audience up to speed plus gives the program a rich texture and depth that is not very common today.  Kudos to WGBH (Boston) and the BBC.    Bottom-line:  This series (5 episodes) should not be missed - you will be depriving yourself of four or five hours of true cinemagraphic enjoyment if you do.
0756404746|5.0|Well let me say usually I dont have the patience for a 722 page book, which is a flaw for someone whos always carrying a book with him everywhere he goes. but most of the time books hit a slow spot half way through and the bigger the book, the bigger the spot.  this book did not.   in full this book was made completely of character development, it didnt do much but set the stage for sequels, but dont let that turn you off to the book. it was outright amazing.  Im a fairly slow reader, I usually read about 50 pages a day, with the name of the wind I wouldnt settle for anything less than 100 and had no trouble completeing that goal.      the only part I Didnt especially like were some of the very last lines depicting how kvothe was slowly fadeing away from working at his tavern.  It just didnt seem like kvothe if you ask me, such a curious mind being trapped, obviously not enjoying it, and continuing to do it.  but then, Maybe the next book will prove the reasons more obvious.  5 stars highly recomended.
B000002U9W|5.0|Although pink floyd other releases were all amazing? None beats atom heart mother,  for the simply fact that, not only it was the first album i heard  when i was 13 but also it got me into prog rock. Im pretty sure also that ahm's influenced over 1000 bands as far as being experimental and progressive goes. i dont think theres a band that tops pink floyd till this day, there never will be. I love rush, deep purple, rolling stones, Jimi hendrix, Elvis,The beatles, beach boys but pink floyd tops them all and not trying to offend any one or anybody. For any one new to pink floyd, or is reading this review, start here. Your life will change forever.
B001U0HBPQ|5.0|When I sat down to watch this film I knew very little about it except that the title character ages backwards. As I began watching the film I saw that the running length was two hours and forty six minute and thought to myself.....this had better be good!<br /><br />I was not disappointed at all in this interesting tale spanning the life of a young man with a very unique problem...... or should I say situtaion. The film is well paced and the special FX are nothing short of amazing. I found myself asking how did they do that?! This makes the story all the more believable and this is probably Brad Pitt's finest hour.....he doesn't have many of them!<br /><br />At times I thought of 'Forrest Gump', but it's a totally different film, they just both happen to be about one man's unique life experiences. I don't know how you couldn't like this film? It's got everything you need to make it an enjoyable experience. Great acting, story, FX and it feels as real as a story like this can feel.
B001P5Q6F2|1.0|I dont just bash albums but no reason, to any one that might think that ? Thats not whats happening here. I have some friends that love deathmetal and grindcore and some mainstream metal, which happens to be the case with lamb of god. Brian is one my best friends, who loves lamb of  god, converge,  killswitch engage, cannibal corpse,  shadows fall, kittie, ac, throwdown,in other words, he loves heavy music. Its a constant fight with him and me cause im not a fan of the screaming aspect of the genre or the way to fast guitars. Its just not my thing, so he let me borrow lamb of gods wrath, thinking maiby i would change my mind. Hmm no, All the songs give me a headache and like all his other music, sounds pretty mediocre to me. The only band i heard that had a decent sound was opeth, but still not into their growls cause sounds unitelligent but  some of opeths more quiet songs were pretty decent. More power to you if you like this kinda of music but i just dont see nothing special or great about it. I remenber when i heard iron maiden or early metallica or megadeth or black sabbath, led zeppellin, to me, that was talent. Bands today lack that talent and most  of them lack solos or real good ones, modern bands sound extremely mediocre to me or the songs tend to be repetive or vocals sound monotone.
B001MEJY8W|5.0|Martyrs is a horrible movie... depressing, brutal, uncompromising, and every other similar adjective you can think of.  No, you won't be having much fun with this one, in fact, nausea may even take hold by the time you reach it's final act.  It'll leave you in near catatonic awe, disturbing thoughts and imagery floating in the back of your head-- making you actually rationalize with yourself that \\"it's just a movie.\\"  The regret of sinking hard earned money to torture yourself with a film that was hardly bearable to watch once-- let alone own(because you know you won't be revisiting it anytime soon, no matter what you try to tell yourself)-- becomes as shameful as the thoughts of neglect you give your grandparents in the nursing home they were forced to reside in(okay, maybe that ones a personal demon).  So why the five stars?  Because, THAT'S what a horror film should do to you!  And I haven't been absolutely destroyed by a horror film like this since The Exorcist-- which is pretty high praise considering most(including myself) feel it's the pinnacle of the genre.  The story follows two young women on a quest for revenge with nothing quite as it seems... and that's all I can say, because the less you know going into this movie-- the better!  Pascal Laugier shows why he's already one of the most sought after horror directors around right now(and has been tapped for a Hellraiser remake... I don't agree with the remake BUT, if it's gonna happen at least they got the right guy) with tight, suspenseful direction and an unflinching lens for both the highly macabre and the emotionally dramatic.  Here, Laugier and his film Martyrs is comparable to the finest designer in the world creating the most beautiful bridal gown ever seen-- the only catch is that it's made entirely from human entrails!  Martyrs is the essence of horror, and although I like my fair share of goofy bloodbaths and carbon copy slashers, being shaken to the core and finding it impossible to flip that final light switch off before lying down for bed is EXACTLY what a horror film should do!  If you couldn't tell yet, I loved Martyrs and feel it's one of the very few modern horror films that stands tall with the absolute best the genre ever delivered-- that being said, it's going to be a long while before I watch it again...l light switch off before lying down for bed is EXACTLY what a horror film should do!

B001RTP3YQ|5.0|I was actually at the London O2 concert last July, and unlike some other concert vs. CD experiences, this one totally captures the magic. That concert was slightly better than the one in Chicago this May, better acoustics at the O2, maybe? Also, the song line-up was slightly different. I think with the exception of the Chelsea Hotel, the London program is the one I prefer.     I just bought another one of these for my mother for Mother's Day.
0307278255|4.0|I greatly enjoyed this book, a series of short stories about different aspects of life in immigrant Indian families, in America as well as abroad.  Lahiri writes about universal themes: love, marriage, solitude, deception. It was an easy and enjoyable read and interesting to discuss with my book club.
B001TOD92C|5.0|This isn't Rocky - so don't expect going in that you're going to come out all warm and fuzzy.  This is more like a fictional documentary of the life of a wrestler - but based on many truths of pulled together in one story and into one character.  Less Hollywood, more real life.  I was immediately drawn into into Rouke's character, Randy \\"The Ram\\".  Randy (great acting by Rouke - or perhaps it wasn't acting...) has a depth and humility that pulls you into his experiences - making you feel his emotional roller coaster.  You ride his highs when he steps into the limelight of the ring - cheered on by the crowd who adores him, and the lows of pretty much his entire life outside of the ring. The movie takes place after The Ram's glory years - we see him only as the washed up, broken down man he has become - the aftermath of what remains of his life after years of neglect. We follow his train wreck up until you has one important choice - to retire and live outside the ring where he has failed so miserably, or to continue wrestling where he is loved and is himself - but likely to die doing so.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie - to the right audience.  The movie is heavy on character, and light on action (some might consider it slow); also, a fair amount of blood and sexual situations.  But as other reviewers have mentioned, wrestling isn't the sole focus of the film - so even non-wrestling fans will enjoy the movie.  Great performances all around as well.

B0015KGJMM|5.0|My father had wanted this particular recording for a few years.  And it had to be the Water Music Suite as conducted by Jordi Saval.  Many other conductors have conducted this piece, but none moved my Dad like Jordi Saval.  So, I searched high & low, on line & off line for it.  Turns out it was out of print.  Couldn't even find a used copy.  Then, after a period of time I started searching again, figuring that maybe it had been re-released.  I looked on Amazon, & there it was!  Needless to say my Dad was ecstatic to get it.  I also enjoy listening to it.
B00003CXDD|3.0|I have good memories of Willow. Rather than going a typical fantasy route, with typical creatures, it sports some wholly unique elements that make for a really fun ride. With the exception of the distressing transformation scenes, this is a perfect movie for older children, and is most comparable to The Never-Ending Story.    However, some elements of Willow just haven't aged well. To me, Willow represents a lukewarm middle ground for George Lucas. On the negative side, it's an uneven mixture of movies he had worked on before, combined with a shot-up plot that wanders all over the place, a really horrible romance subplot, and a disjointed script. It's brightened up by some passable-to-stellar acting, great ideas, and interesting characters. The resulting film only manages to limp to the finish line. I feel that this movie points toward Lucas' devolution to a hack vomiting out horrid Star Wars prequels more than anything else.    It's very sad that this movie isn't any better; it has great ideas, many lovable characters, and a very good heart. You can't help rooting for it, riding along with it, and forgiving its slights. It's kind of like a goofy, lovable, dorky friend. Sure, this dorky pal says and does things that make you wince and groan, but he's such a cool person underneath all the awkwardness that you can easily overlook his faux pas and just love him all the same. My family and I laughed at this film, threw out one-liners, and shook our heads at the corny bits, but we also had a great time -- and there's not a kid among us!    The cons are legion. The script is wince-worthy, but passable; the characters seem to wander in mindless circles; the romance is terrible, and the transformation scenes are nauseating and painful to watch. The plot is rather awkward and full of irritating holes, the most bothersome being that Elora Danan is not responsible for the death of Queen Bavmorda as much as she's the catalyst for a deus ex machina. Furthermore, sometimes it's difficult to infer the intended meaning from certain scenes -- for example, when Willow and Meegosh are standing by the road, trying to hand out Elora Danan to an army. The first time I watched this I thought it was Bavmorda's army (when it was actually Eric's), and this is only cleared up after a couple of minutes had passed. It wasn't a natural confusion, if that makes sense -- not an intended confusion. Indeed, sometimes it seemed as though the filmmakers were kind of lazy and just shot everything willy-nilly, praying it would all come out in the end.    This is also not a special edition as much as it is the not-VHS-version. There is commentary by Warwick Davis and sadly... that's pretty much it.    The pros of this movie are myriad. Probably the most outstanding element of this movie is its optimistic outlook and its wonderful characters, as well as its unique take on the fantasy genre. It's not fair to compare this to Tolkien or as a mere Star Wars ripoff; both of these took quite liberally from the fairytale formula. Frankly, that fairytale formula is all that Willow takes from. With the exception of the Nelwyns, I never once thought of Tolkien; with the exception of Bavmorda's face at the end of the movie, I never thought of Star Wars.    I also loved Willow's characters. Bavmorda is a fantastic villain; one-sided, yes, but such a delightfully horrible character that it's a blast to watch her go down. Madmartigan is downright fun -- half Jack Sparrow, half Han Solo. Sorsha manages to come across as more than a politically correct, stereotypical, token female warrior (at least, until the bizarre addition of romance). The Brownies, Franjean and Rool, were a blast. And a big shout-out to Warwick Davis, who played the title role -- a fabulous job for a young actor! I was also completely impressed by Julie Peters, who played Kaiya. She was absolutely believable. It's only a shame she hasn't been able to play in any other leading roles.    Special effects range from pretty terrible (the trolls) to extremely cool (the two-headed dragon) to holy crap, I want to throw up (every single transformation scene). Still, for the most part, they're all right for a late 80s film (and I'm very impartial to stop-motion animation anyway, so I loved watching the dragon and didn't mind that a bit).    This might also sound rather silly, but I absolutely loved the nonsensical fantasy names they used in this movie. Every fantasy buff knows that fantasy names can be a nightmare to hear, read, or remember, mostly because they're full of random vowels and consonants that were all slapped together at random. But in Willow, almost every name is strangely appropriate and memorable. They're often lyrical (Kaiya, Elora Danan, Raziel, Tir Asleen), or the consonants and vowels are put together in just the right combination to create certain feelings (Bavmorda -- all of those hard, angry consonants in close quarters), or sound faintly reminiscent of something else (Madmartigan, Sorsha, Tir Asleen [Tir na Nog]). Whoever named those characters did an admirable job!    Don't go into Willow expecting too much, but don't go into it expecting it to completely suck, either. I own it; I'm glad to own it. I think it's a unique spin on the fairytale formula, and that most people will really enjoy it if they suspend their belief.
0553807048|5.0|I couldn't put it down. I am sorry for all the hurt and sadness that Jordon has brought on himself, his family and his friends. It is refreshing however for someone to really turn their life around. I am sure it has been difficult to retell these stories but the message of what greed, drugs and excess can do to people should be told. Congrats to Mr. Belfort for having the courage to do just that! I can't wait for the movie.

B001U0HBPG|5.0|Benjamin Button (first DVD release) Unforgettable. This movie is packed with memorable moments that really moved me. When watching, it became trivial to worry about a plot, and intoxicating to watch scenes unfold as individual works of art. Young Benjamin getting out of his wheelchair at church service. The twenty-year old Daisy, flooded with youthful lighting and glowing red hair in the ballet. The death of the tugboat captain. I cared about the characters and the story, I loved the movie.
B001AVEJ1Y|4.0|So much was riding on J.J. Abrams here.  This was not just about whether a Trek reboot would work; it was about the survival of Trek, period.  Some reboots worked, like Batman Begins, and some didn't (Planet of the Apes, anyone?)  I am pleased to say Star Trek falls into the former category.    Breaking from the canonical story line was a gutsy move, but one that was necessary. Trek is myth.  Anyone who has studied mythology knows that the stories can change in the telling.  Read King Arthur -- some versions have Lancelot, some don't.  In some versions Arthur lives in a picturesque Camelot, in others it's a more primitive stone and wooden fort.  The important thing is this: the core truths stay the same.    It's okay to break with canon, and what we are given here is a very swift, efficient way to not wipe the slate clean, but create space for the retelling.  The rogue Romulan Captain Nero (Eric Bana) comes crashing into the 23rd century from the future, and he destroys the USS Kelvin (killing Kirk's father in the process) with his massive mining ship.  Bam!  We're off into a new timeline.  Any Trekker will know the severe consequences of messing with the past, and the effects of this incident ripple into the lives of Kirk, Spock, and the gang.    It's at this point we meet the young Kirk, made perhaps even more reckless now that he is fatherless, and Spock, who as a young man was truly struggling with his Vulcan-Human nature in a way we never saw in TOS or the previous movies.  We are also (re) introduced to the razor-sharp Uhura, whose strength is on clear display here, and of course Scotty (love Simon Pegg), Sulu, and Chekov.    The story that brings them together is the urgent challenge to thwart Captain Nero as he executes his genocidal agenda to wipe out the Federation one planet at a time.  Why?  Because in his time the elder Spock and the Federation failed to save Romulus from a supernova.  Now the earlier Federation ships are powerless to stop him,       Some have pointed out a key plot flaw: that being stranded in a time decades before his birth, a more logical path for Nero would be to simply warn the Romulans of the impending doom.  However, Nero is deranged.  He is willing and able to destroy six billion lives.  He is consumed by an obsession that rivals that of Khan, who could have reigned supreme once he had the Genesis Device.  It wasn't about that, however, it was about getting Kirk.    Similar situation here:  Nero is twisted; his agenda is rotting his soul.  The movie could have fleshed this out more, but I think the attentive viewer will see this.  In his contorted mind Spock was at fault for the destruction of Romulus -- Spock was going to pay.    The movie is a joy to watch.  It is bittersweet seeing Nimoy as Spock for perhaps the last time.  Without spoiling anything, there is grievous destruction, tight urgency, and a nearly \\"no-win\\" scenario for the nascent crew to overcome.  Except for the shallow characterization of Nero, it's hard to find fault with this film.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|Kingdom of Heaven (Director's Cut)  Awesome. Some movies need a second watch to appreciate the details. This is the most honest and detail oriented movie I've ever seen about the Crusades. While it is fiction, the essence of the story is very real, and of course very entertaining. Its heavy handed, extremely violent and unforgiving, so it's not a surprise that the general public might not embrace it. But it is a rich movie, deep with perspectives, and I give it very high regards.

B001PPLIEG|1.0|Quantum of Solace (first DVD release)  Garbage. Absolutely horrible. Plagued as a bad movie in plot and script, as well as a technical DVD release with bad sound quality. Honestly, when the movie ended, I still had no idea what it was about. I didn't know the names of any of the characters besides James and M, and I didn't care. Sadly this movie was produced very differently that Casino Royale, which made for an impressive debut of Daniel Craig as 007. Where Royale focused on story and relationships, Quantum focused on out-of-place sci-fi like effects, and everything moment a queue to start the next long-winded action scene.
B000XYNFD2|5.0|Good piece of gear.  Arrived earlier than projected delivery date in a box that by itself is worthy of compliments.  A colleague of mine noticed my watch and immediately compared it to his Rolex with the aim of letting me know how much better his Rolex is than my watch.  I took this as a compliment of course.  After trying to put down the Invicta by asking whether it was automatic or had Swiss movement, he finally broke down and said with an air of superiority, \\"well, my Rolex cost a lot more money\\".  I am certainly not a watch expert, but I am quite pleased with my purchase.
0321127420|5.0|I want to say first of all that this is an awesome book, one of my favorite books and a must-read for anyone who wants to be involved in enterprise computing.    Beginners can quickly learn the field's key terms and concepts and understand why things are done in a certain way.  Intermediate and expert developers can use it to explore the design options available to them and revisit and modernize their designs in the future.    What do I not like about this book?  Although I understand the book size limitations and the author warns readers right away about what didn't fit in, I still wish there was more coverage of mobile applications and problems unique to mobile front-ends.    Seven years after the book was originally published, and now that smartphone-based UI becoming more and more popular every year, I wish there was a second edition of this great book with more coverage of this particular area of enterprise applications.
6303014100|5.0|Gettysburg brings to the screen the battle that many believe determined the outcome of the American Civil War. The setting is July 1863, Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, and the Confederate armies under General Robert E. Lee have converged on this location in an effort to bring the war to the North and force a negotiated peace treaty after two and half years of fighting.  Martin Sheen, Tom Berenger, and the rest of the cast, have done a great job with their performances.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows. Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few thrills, not to mention a few tears.   The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the costumes, and the music are all very good.  In short, Gettysburg is a film definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection along with the masterpiece Gods and Generals starring Robert Duvall and Jeff Daniels among others! 4.5 Stars

B001U0HBPG|4.0|The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a very interesting account of a man born old and growing younger with time. Brad Pitt's character wasn't as distinguished as I would've thought. Benjamin serves as a much more passive character, but I think Pitt expresses well with his face and eyes. Cate Blanchett was amazing as Daisy--her character was lively, vivacious, and stole the presence of the movie more so than anyone else. It can be a heavy movie to digest because it revolves around the theme of life and death, the phases of life, and time. The love story was beautiful and engaging and, for as strange the Pitt/Blanchett pairing seemed at first, it panned out well.
B001AVEJ1Y|1.0|I knew JJ Abrahms had completely missed it when:    - I saw the Enterprise being built ON LAND in a farm field in Iowa.  - When Kirk says \\"Hey man\\".  - When Spock is making out with Uhura  - Starfleet academy looks like the a scene from Starship Troopers.  - Spock's (Nimoy) makeup looks cheap (looks like a bag of talcum powder exploded on his face.  - Scotty's and Chekov's accents are even MORE laughable than the original cast's cheasy version.  - Sulu was NOT at the helm at the maiden voyage of the Enterprise (he was a scientist)  - everyone is \\"angry\\" or an a55hole.      In 1966 the studio execs though the show was too \\"cerebral\\" for the masses.  Looks like the execs can relax now...JJ Abrams has dumbed down the whole franchise to match the pointless, loud, shootem up, blow it up, obnoxious Transformer-GI Joe-Starship trooper, special effects dependedent [...] that will be playing in theaters near you this summer.

This love spills over to the reader, effortlessly.  A special kudo goes to the humor and empathy for the poor bear who ends up going home alone, dejected, at the end ...
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|The original Star Trek series took time to establish itself as the premiere franchise it is today. The movies steadily improved the characters and special effects, building on a large canon of established Trek lore.  The best movies gleefully embraced this rich history; the failures ignored or contradicted it. Star Trek is simply too big to reinvent, and J.J. Abrams knows it.  So he did the next best thing by tweaking the established universe of Star Trek just enough to carve out his own little patch for the movie.<br /><br />This is the beginning of Star Trek re-imagined as a futuristic Earth that incorporates the go-go 60s with iPod style.  We see Kirk as a kid on the farm, Spock struggling with his half-Vulcan nature and Bones becoming a crotchety windbag--which, it becomes quickly apparent, he always was. We witness Kirk's solution to the Kobiyashi Maru, Spock's acceptance to Starfleet, and the construction of the Enterprise.  In short, this is a true and proper launch of a Star Trek movie, from the beginning, so that all those non-Trekkies won't feel like they missed out...<br /><br />But if you are a non-Trekkie, you missed out.  There are so many nods to Trek lore that my head nearly exploded. SPOILER RED ALERT.<br /><br />Sulu fences! There's a splash of light over the captain's eyes when he sits on the bridge, just like the original series. Red shirts die! The same sounds beep and bleep in the background, from the sensors to the transporters. There are several Wrath of Khan references, from Spock's famous last words to creepy worms that take control of your brain. There's even old-style Romulans and Klingons.  Fans worried that Abrams was going to remake the series in such a way as to make it unrecognizable can rest easy; this is the Star Trek we know and love, dusted off and buffed to a 21st century shine.<br /><br />The plot involves time travel, a guest cameo, and references to the central conceit of the series: Spock follows the rules, Bones doesn't, and Kirk floats above it all, waffling between the two ideologies and blazing his own path as his ego suits him. The movie has no qualms about portraying Kirk as a womanizing jerk or using him as the butt of some hilarious slapstick. It also isn't afraid to push the envelope with the aliens, going beyond makeup to ensure they're just unnerving enough for you to notice them even if the rest of the crew doesn't. This is more than just a new Star Trek, it's Star Trek done right with a bigger budget.<br /><br />There are some flaws.  The villain is one dimensional. Uhura's headstrong personality has to carry the burden of embodying all females in Trek, which begins to grate. Winona Ryder (age 38) seems to have wandered onto the set to play Spock's (Zachary Quinto, age 32) mother. And an uncharacteristically vengeful tactics from the good guys at the end of the movie borders on \\"ludicrous speed.\\"<br /><br />But you know what? I forgive all that.  This movie made Trek worth watching all over again and reminded us why it's okay to travel through time and space, encounter green alien hotties, and bed them.  Because it's FUN.ling between the two ideologies and blazing his own path as his ego suits him.

B001GCUO1G|4.0|I didn't expect much from the Wolverine movie.  Billed as X-Men 4 by the movie theater (says so right on my ticket), it is anything but.  This is Wolverine getting the full Weapon X treatment, a mystery that took forever in comic-land to finally reveal. And with a few exceptions, Wolverine gets it right.<br /><br />Whereas the previous X-Men movies became increasingly complex, with jumbled storylines and too many characters, a single character sharpens Wolverine's plot to a knife's edge. Nigh immortal and capable of regenerating from the most grievous wounds, Wolverine and his brother Sabretooth slash their way through the century, engaging in every major war and some minor ones too. For a little while, that's enough, until Sabretooth's propensity for raping and pillaging gets out of hand. A firing squad doesn't do the job (that whole immortal thing), which is when General Stryker offers a devil's deal.<br /><br />There's nothing new here with the exception of the movie's primary x-factor: Wolverine.  Jackman transforms Wolverine from a passive loner to an outraged spirit of vengeance as everyone he loves dies. And behind it all, pulling the puppet strings, is Stryker, channeling Hannibal from the A-Team.<br /><br />Throughout his adventures, Wolverine is surrounded by a cadre of other mutants with their own abilities. Unlike the other X-Men movies, each mutant serves a very specific purpose.  Nothing feels forced.  Except for maybe the Blob, but he's amusing enough in early and later incarnations to provide some much needed levity that borders on the game Super Punchout.<br /><br />The real revelation here is Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool. Reynolds did a great job as a sword wielding antihero in the last Blade movie and he's largely the same wisecracking nut job here.  Only he's much cooler and plays a larger role (think Darth Maul without the makeup).<br /><br />There are some odd points where the Wolverine movie isn't sure where to go.  Stryker, for all his duplicity, often seems content to pull the movie villain mistake of letting people just walk out of his grasp.  Some twists are emphasized with a theatrical exclamation point as the character tells us in no uncertain terms exactly what their plans are. And a few feats of derring-do border on the ludicrous...<br /><br />But then I remember this is a movie about a comic about a guy who has metal claws between his knuckles. If you can keep that perspective, Wolverine is a lot like the titular character's signature move: it tears through crowded plot lines with deadly efficiency. And if you're a fan of other members of the Weapon X program, stay to the end of the credits. You can thank me later.villain mistake of letting people just walk out of his grasp.

B001ECQ75A|4.0|\\"Kung Fu Panda\\" is one of the more pleasant surprises to come out of the Hollywood animated film machine these days.  While the Pixar movies are virtual locks for greatness, the rest of the genre has become rather tired, with big name stars lining up for movies designed for max box office appeal rather than great storytelling.      So the non-Pixar test these days is, are we watching something more akin to \\"Shrek,\\" or closer to \\"Shrek the Third\\"?    \\"KFP\\" is, thank goodness, right up there with \\"Shrek\\" in the pantheon of enjoyable animated films not produced by Pixar.  Jack Black is the perfect choice to play Po, the panda seemingly consigned by fate and fat to sell noodles the rest of his life.  But Po's destiny is to be something else- the Dragon Warrior, who shall bring peace to all.    Black's comedic timing is on display as he gets virtually all the great lines in this movie, although Dustin Hoffman does yeoman's work as his kung fu mentor, Master Shifu.  This movie essentially wastes other big names who were cast for no apparent reason, as they lend very little to the story:  Angelina Jolie, Seth Rogan, Lucy Liu, David Cross and Jackie Chan lend their voices to the Furious Five (a collection of kung fu warriors), but none of these fine actors does anything significant.  Ian MacShane plays the villain as only he can, but in large part this is Black's and Hoffman's show.    Very family friendly, with more than a few \\"fat jokes\\" thrown in (but these are more funny than caustic).  Excellent animation and solid storytelling throughout - this is a very good family film.

B001AVEJ1Y|4.0|I'm not a full-fledged Trekkie, but I am familiar with \\"Star Trek\\" and made sure I watched J.J. Abrams' take on the classic sci-fi story. It's a lot of fun with plenty of laugh-out-loud dialogue, dazzling special effects, and action to satisfy the fanboys and girls and those looking for escapism. There are some issues I had with the film, but those will be addressed at a later time.<br /><br />This newest installment to the franchise is a prequel to the lives of James T. Kirk, Mr. Spock, Dr. McCoy and the rest of the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise and how they become the familiar bunch who travel through space having numerous adventures.<br /><br />Jim Kirk, played by Chris Pine, didn't have an easy welcome into his world. His father died while he was being born and his mother never recovered from it, so he cruises along Iowa causing trouble while trying to win over every pretty girl. Aside from his playboy attitude, he has a mind made for complex problem solving, so he's recruited to join the Starfleet Academy to train for space missions. Also present are Spock (the always charismatic Zachary Quinto), whose half human/half Vulcan blood made him aspire to never feel emotion, or \\"become truly Vulcan.\\" These guys don't mesh well in the beginning as they are the complete opposites: Kirk is the wily and passionately pesky heartthrob, Spock is the embodiment of composure and philosophically stoic. Also along for the ride are Sulu (John Cho), Chekhov (Anton Yelchin--dig the hokey Russian accent), Scottie (Simon Pegg, one of my favorites), and Ohura (Zoe Saldana).<br /><br />The antagonism between Kirk and Spock is the central storyline in between the threat of a vengeful Romulan called Nero (portrayed with relish by Eric Bana), who's mission is to destroy worlds associated with the intergalactic Federation he feels are responsible for a personal tragedy. It's up to a young, inexperienced crew who had only troubleshot problems in a simulator to find the chemistry to defeat a being whose not afraid to destroy worlds.<br /><br />Nero's conflict is built up nicely, but this is where one of my issues with the film comes in to focus. His motivation is overused in so many other films. The reasoning--and the explanation behind the conflict--rush through so quickly. It took me a while to put two and two together and I still don't think I completely understand it. And this is supposed to be the whole \\"Why\\" of the film. Also, call me a Purist, but they never showed half naked women or making out in the shows; I understand the catering to a younger crowd, but really. The relationship between Ohura and Spock was a definite wonder. Was it really necessary to make these characters romantically interested in one another? I didn't think so.<br /><br />However, some of the material is surprisingly deep. Spock's struggle to find balance between his love for his human mother with his half-breed status, frowned upon by other Vulcans, is moving.<br /><br />But sit back and enjoy the goings on of that infamous band of Trekkers on the Enterprise. It's so much fun because the characters make it fun. Going back for seconds shouldn't be too hard.to destroy worlds.

B0019X3ZZY|5.0|It has taken me a few days now to try and make some resolution in my mind from what I've seen in this film. At first I had regret about watching this movie, feeling that it has caused a permanent scar in my psyche, (and I am an avid horror fan) in order to piece this together, I had to read up on several other reviews on the film, and look into the history of Italian facism, and you can begin to draw parallels.   At first I had asked God as to why he would allow such a movie to be made, but as I look deeper into it, it is probably the most important statement ever made in cinema in the form of very bitter medicine, that does not go down easily to say the least.   I had to give this a full rating, because what Pasolini, succeeded in doing was to give the viewer the grim, dark realistic feeling of what it is like to truly live under a facist dictatorship.   There are those who say that this movie is not for everybody, but I say that every person who continues to wish to live in a free society should see and analyze this film, and if you are worried about being squeamish, just think of how those who were victimized under Mussolini and Hitler felt during WWII under facist rule. Salo is not a sick exploitation film, but it is an artisic masterpiece and is no doubt, educational.

B001ILHY1I|4.0|Death Race is an updated remake of the cult classic movie, Death Race 2000.  Where Death Race 2000 took place out on the streets of America, this movie takes place in a high security prison called Terminal Island.  It is the year 2012, and the US economy has collapsed, and private companies now run our prisons.  \\"Gladiator Death Races\\" now entertain the masses of America, and also fund Terminal Island.  Inmates drive custom death cars around a prison death track.  Inmates may acquire offensive or defensive weapons to eliminate the other racers.  The object is to be the last inmate to cross the finish line after 3 stages of the race.        Into this scenario comes Jensen Amos ( Jason Statham), who has been accused and sentenced for the murder of his wife and child.  Jensen is offered the opportunity to stand in for Frankenstein, one of the premier death racers, who has died in his last race unbeknownest to the public and other racers.  Jensen becomes familiar with his pit crew led by Coach (Ian McShane), and his female assistant, Case (Natalie Martinez).  Together, they take on the other Death Racers in the 2 races leading up to the Final Race.  Jensen's big rival is Machine Gun Joe (Tyrese Gibson).  The warden in charge of Terminal Island and the Death Races is Hennessey, played by a serious Joan Allen.      There is plenty of action, explosions, and deaths in Death Race.  One of my favorite scenes, is in Stage 2 of the race, where the racers have to not only take on each other, but the tanker/tank Dreadnaught.  The end of that race is very cool, and nicely explained in the Bonus Features.  The movie is set in a bleak environment, with alot of greys, blacks, and other dark colors.  The special effects are great in the way the various drivers meet their demise.      There are 3 items in the Bonus Features.  1) Start Your Engines: Making a Death Race.  Explains the making of Death Race, and how the filmmakers wanted to make a more dark and serious film than Death Race 2000.  2) Behind The Wheel : Dissecting the Stunts.  This feature broked down the filming of the stunts and how they were devised.  As I mentioned earlier, the part on the Dreadnaught was pretty cool.  3) Feature Commentary with Director and Producer.  There are also some trailers of other movies at the beginning of the DVD.      If you enjoy action, cars and crashes, you should like Death Race.  Having been a fan of Death Race 2000, I was not disappointed by this remake.  Similar but definitely stands on its own! See it !

B001EOQTM4|2.0|This refers to the 2009 vinyl re-issue of the album,which I think happens to be an underrated classic,one of Sabbath's finest moments,but Rhino didn't do it justice,all you get is regular 140 g vinyl,no liner notes,no lyrics,nothing but the cover and the vinyl in a simple paper sleeve,it wouldn't have killed then to at least make it a gatefold with pictures and/or lyrics,I mean,why re-issue it if you're not going to do something special with it?.Great album,crap re-issue!.
B00001OH7Y|5.0|This release is the first after the \\"Berlin Trilogy\\", recorded in Germany, including \\"Low\\", \\"Heros\\" and \\"The Lodger\\".  The German industrial music scene had an obvious influence on Bowie, as proven by the grinding guitar and screaming keyboards on these recordings.  This disk begins with a Japanese version of \\"It's No Game\\", which is repeated in English to conclude the release.  \\"Up the Hill Backward\\" is a catchy tune with layered vocals throughout.  \\"Scary Monsters\\", with Robert Fripp's famous guitar work, dueling Carlos Alomar's sleek style is a racing number with interesting vocal effects.  Chuck Hammer's guitar synthesizer provides an interplay to Andy Clark's synthesizer and E Street member Roy Bittan's piano on \\"Ashes To Ashes\\", which revisits the \\"Space Oddity\\" theme of Major Tom.  Clark, Fripp and Alomar also star on \\"Fashion\\", another of the charting singles off this one.  Bitton's memorable piano is one of the highlights of \\"Teenage Wildlife\\", \\"Scream Like a Baby\\" features Bowie's soaring vocals and Clark's synthesizer lines. \\"Kingdom Come\\", the only cover on this one (Tom Verlaine) shows Bowie's reverence for Television and their punk purism. Pete Townsend guests on guitar on \\"Because We're Young\\", and the recording ends with an English version of \\"It's No Game\\".  The re-release features better sound recording and four nuggets that were not previously available, including different versions of \\"Space Oddity\\", \\"Panic in Detroit\\", \\"Crystal Japan\\", and a version of \\"Alabama Song\\", the Brecht classic also covered by the Doors.  Fripp's and the influence of Brian Eno (who did not appear on this release, but was instrumental in the sound of the Berlin trilogy) shows on the arrangements and orchestration of the entire album.  This is great release, quite definite of the times.  Get the re-release for the additional cuts, they do not disappoint.
0316017922|3.0|OUTLIERS is a pretty good book , light reading, with an interesting take on success. Providing very well known and pertinent examples and extensively researched in some places the strength of this book is the  human element of its anecdotes. Telling stories of real people who achieved unbelievable success (Bill Gates) while comparing them to others with similar potential who never amounted to a hill of beans. Why did one became one of the world's richest people while the other never made it out of his small town?<br /><br />The simple prose makes OUTLIERS a very quick read but by the time I had finished I knew little more about success than I did before I started. The underlying message, that success is a matter or being in the right place at the right time does little to help me in my pursuit of fame and fortune. If you're looking for a book on how YOU can be successful then OUTLIERS is not for you. Hardly anything from this book can be applied to your life.<br /><br />But if you're interested in learning why some rise to the top of their profession while more capable souls dwell in the confines of middle-management then OUTLIERS paints a very clear picture. It's good reading but the content is not earth shattering. A perfect book to read while lounging on the hammock on a Sunday, or to take to bed each night and hammer out a few pages.<br /><br />Mark McGinty is the author of ELVIS AND THE BLUE MOON CONSPIRACY

I could not think of one complaint except that it was over after only 2 hours and there is not a sequel coming out right away. I wanted more more more. The cast was perfect, Zachary Quinto refreshed my crush on Spock and Chris Pine was a fantastic Kirk. Everyone was perfectly cast.  I have been a Star Trek geek since I was five and this movie brought all of that back.  I am keeping my fingers crossed for a another one.
0307341569|3.0|This book starts out really good and kept me reading.  However, I have two complaints. Part of the murder is easy to figure out from the start and left me impatient waiting for Libby to figure it out. The ending was also not believable at all and seemed kind of \\"thrown together\\" and the character Ben's behavior on the night of the murders and afterwards did not for me gell with the character of Ben that had been developed up to that point.  Plus Diondra and Crystal were not developed enough.  Maybe a couple chapters from their perspective?  However, this book is well written with lots of small unusual details thrown in that make it seem realistic and it is fast paced enough that it kept me entertained.
0451203933|5.0|Well written, extremely well researched and riveting account of the American forces that tried to make a quick capture of two lieutenants of war lord Mohamed Farrah Aidid within the urban city of Mogadishu only to become trapped within the City having to cut their way out and return with a slowly mobilized rescue force to extricate the remaining forces trapped over night. The author, who is a historian and not a pure journalist, has an unusual ability to obtain numerous interviews, predominantly American but also Somalis involved in the fight, with extraordinary access to military communications that really describe the intensity of battle and the feelings of the participants. Full of first hand accounts, you get the battlefield perception of forces on the ground and the pilots in the Blackhawks along with smaller craft referred to as 'little birds'. The author also has a knack for bringing the reader a graphic view of the soldier's lifestyle, particularly away from home and explains in there detail what it means to be a Ranger or 'Delta boy\\" and the differences in operations and force membership. The accounts are graphic at times on how they fight boredom and deal with battle stress, thus this truly an adult book on the riggers of being in a combat force. The writing is intense, capturing the feelings of the soldiers that although appearing to be a routine mission turns into a nightmare as logistics and radio communications break down, made more complex by the downing of two blackhawks changing the quick get in get out mission into a rescue mission that bogs down within the urban city contested by Para-military forces and pure civilians armed with everything from AK-47s to rocket propelled grenades, the latter bringing down the blackhawks. Highly personalized views of the soldiers who face intense fire from a multitude of directions as every Somalia seems to be armed from a 5 year old that shoots wildly at a convoy to a mother armed with a baby in one hand and well armed Somalis firing from the constant massing of crowds. The authors bring you back and forth between the different military elements following time lines and it is often an agonizing read as you want to know immediately how each participant or group survives. A classic example is downed pilot and lone survivor of a crash, Mike Durrant who is badly wounded and pinned in the wreckage waiting for help that can't get there in time His fate is a constant unknown as you read about his capture and potential death by the Somalis. The fighting is severe and often cruel as the fire is constant and the hatred of the American's intense. It seems a miracle that only 18 soldiers were killed and just under 80 were wounded, many severely, while countless thousands of Somalis were killed and wounded. The author is extremely objective explaining what happens and he is unusual in that he does not cast blame but reports it an unusual subdued factual way. You often wonder while reading the book why no back up force was ready to immediately go in and he explains that in detail, it wasn't that simple. But this is an amazing account of highly professional soldiers trapped with in a wild west city of surprisingly well armed Somalis who rally together, even their company clerks man the rescue force and perform like warriors, to save their comrades and cut them out.  The book is now used by the army to study urban warfare and the author is often called upon to speak to military personnel, virtually as an expert, on what went wrong and to learn from that experience.l armed Somalis firing from the constant massing of crowds.

0756405890|5.0|WOW! What a book, never before have I read a book as good as this by a first time author, not just in the fantasy genre but in any genre, a truly remarkable feat.<br /><br />This book is brilliantly written and written with intelligence.<br />This book is set in the first and third person, I was a bit worried about that to be honest but it was very easy to read so there is know need to worry about that.<br /><br />Ok, now for a bit of the story. It starts of in a small Inn, the Waystone Inn, the Innkeeper is a man called Kote(this is the third person parts of the book) Kote has a dark secret, it's not till he rescues a man in the forest that his secret is found out.<br />The man is called chronicler and he is the geatest storyteller of his age, he has come in search of a man named Kvothe, Kvothe is the most powerful and feared wizard of the age.<br />Soon after recovering from being attacked he discovers the young Innkeeper is the man he has been searching for, he soon persuades the reluctant young man to tell his story.<br /><br />Kvothe starts his story(this is the first person parts of the book) as a young boy travelling with his familys troup of travelling performers, he tells of his eduction at the hands of the wizard Ben and there deep friendship he also tell how his family and troup were killed at the hands of the dreaded Lord Halifax. He tells of his time as street orphan and theif till he meets a master storytellar and turns his life around and he enters the university and there he finds a home.<br />This book has action, adventure and some great comical moments.<br /><br />From what I know there is to be two sets of trilogys, the first trilogy has Kvothe telling of his adventures and the second is set in the time when Kvothe is telling his story.<br />Alas the British readers will have to wait till early 2009 to read the next book in this trilogy.<br />If your going to read any book this year read this one, your in for a treat.

B0012QE4Q2|1.0|I don't mind historical fiction to take liberties, but is should do so to good effect.<br /><br />The Philippa Gregory book, that this was supposed to be based upon, certainly diverged from truth, but the end result was touching and interesting.<br /><br />So, when I bought this movie I didn't expect accuracy, but I did expect to be entertained. The only connection between this and the Gregory books, besides fleeting moments, is the title. This is even less accurate than the book, and much less entertaining.<br /><br />The makers compressed relationships so much that the audience doesn't have a chance to care about any of these people. The Mary/Henry relationship in the book was much more fleshed out -- Mary was the main character. They're barely shown having a relationship, yet the movie tried to trade on that bond.<br /><br />The Anne/Henry relationship was just a mess, following no logic. We know he turned on her, but the movie would have you believe that he did so after one conversation with Catherine, but that he married her anyhow -- completely random. If the events of the relationship with Anne post marriage were any faster, they'd be a montage. There was no time at all to see it slipping away from Anne. There are a couple brief scenes where they show her desperate, but to someone unfamiliar with it all, it wouldn't convey the true scope of what happened. Even a Lifetime movie fleshes out characters better than this, even the villainous  husband characters.<br /><br />I loved when Stafford proposed to Mary and they'd simply not cared to point out that her first husband had died. We see him early on looking sad that his wife has to bed the king and then he's shuffled off the stage. This has to be confusing to people not familiar enough with the story.<br /><br />Everybody was wasted in this, the whole movie was a waste. Throw away accuracy, if you must, but the result should still be a good story. This movie failed in every way possible.<br /><br />I told my husband to take it to work and stick a post-it note on it with \\"FREE\\" on it in big letters.on it with \\"FREE\\" on it in big letters.

031606792X|5.0|Yes, I was one of those crazy fans that read the first three books in a total of three days.  I cried over having to wait a year for Breaking Dawn.  I marked August 2nd on the calendar, and I waited.  I could not imagine what conflict Meyer could bring to what could have been the perfect, problem free ending.  I obviously was proved wrong.      Though I do agree that the novel is beautiful and ends the Twilight saga on a sweet and blissful note, the novel was almost too filled with(dare I question Stephenie's judgment?) uncalled for problems.  The book was almost choppy.  I think with the amount of conflict roaming around, Breaking Dawn could have easily been two different books, or maybe even three if Meyer was willing to write some serious elaboration.     I found Breaking Dawn, though very much Jacob packed, free from a good amount of miles of endless Bella and Jacob jabber that were in both New Moon and Eclipse.  I would have liked to have seen more change in Bella and Edward's relationship considering they are married and this is a romance novel, but the book will please those looking for just enough romantic fluff.        Why I rated this so highly is because I loved this novel despite my trivial issues with it.  I found it beautiful, and though I greatly hated to admit that the series was over, I was satisfied with the absolutely shocking content.  Meyer certainly knows how to pull the rug out from under peoples feet and the book deserves high ratings just for eloquence and sheer unexpectedness.     (Extra Note:  Thought I'd just throw this in because I find this \\"issue\\" obnoxious.  I know there is much shallow and pointless arguing related to the Twilight vs. Harry Potter scene.  Drop it!  What is there to argue about?  It all deals with personal opinions, and I myself find them both excellently written.  The two are very different with completely different plots and conflicts.  Romance vs. fantasy?  Forks vs. Hogwarts?  Harry vs. Edward( or maybe protagonist view speaking, Harry vs. Bella)?  I am blind to see any similarities worth so much scrutiny, and I will be happy when those stupid Twilight and Harry Potter pop-ups quit interrupting me.  Sorry for my ranting.)
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|I didn't know what to expect with this remake, but I was totally impressed with the feel of it.  The casting was perfect!  The story was \\"classic trek\\" which should make any fan of the original television series more than pleased.  There were a few odd additions  (like the quirky relationship between Uhura and Spock, the fate of Spock's mother, and the ultimate demise of the Romulan villain) that didn't gel with what I remembered from the original, but hopefully if this remake kick-starts a new resurgence of sequels, these odd additions may evolve and/or be explained in later movies.<br /><br />Overall, this is an awesome remake amidst a dismal gallery of very bad ones in a variety of genres.  They got it so right... thank goodness!  Enjoy and of course, Live Long and Prosper!
0393312836|4.0|A coming of age novel about a boy with no moral center.  I found the main character's weakness for music a bit unplausible, as was his 'rehabilitation', which seems to me to be discordant with the whole Pavlovian conditioning concept.  Today, the shock value the book provides feels more like someone yelling guttural slurs rather than singing in a twisted melody, like Portishead, as I'm sure it seemed in the early '60 (please excuse the imprecise and very subjective simile).  Lastly, the really cool lexicon used by the main characters also seems too academically rendered, since slang usually evolves to decrease syllables and increase ease of speaking, while the language here was a bit laborious, you viddy?    All in all, these are minor annoyances.  The story offers a piercing glimpse into our own psyches, where we push down many taboo impulses in hopes of maintaining civility around us.  The character ends the novel (in the non-american version) not necessarily learning anything (in my opinion) but realizing how tiring it is to be rebellious.  Now that is a realistic.

0747599874|4.0|Any fan of the Harry Potter series will be very pleased with this book.  The companion book mentioned in \\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\\" offers more of J.K. Rowlings writings in short; and humorous, stories akin to Aesop's Fables written for wizarding kids.  The addition of personal musings by Albus Dumbledor adds yet another dimention to the stories as he adds his own views and opinions to the stories.  A must have for any fan of Harry Potter.

After watching this film, I must say this is his best work to date. The choreography is top notch as well as his acting and Donnie hardly kicks (Donnie Yen is known for his acrobatic Kicks) in the film which is hard to believe!. The style that he uses in the film is Wing Chun which uses more arm and hand combat, and less kicking like the Mantis Style. There is one crucial point to this film, and that is Donnie Yen portrays the life of Ip Man. Ip Man was a master of Wing Chun in the 1930's from Fo Shan, China. This is the first film ever to be filmed about the life and times of Ip Man and it was worth the wait. For those of you who is not familiar with Ip Man, he was the instructor who taught Lee Jun-Fan (; pinyin: L Zhènfn) also known as Bruce Lee.    Did you know that Ip Man and Bruce Lee were on Film together?. Watch \\"Enter The Dragon\\" you will see Ip Man in a cameo appearance with Bruce Lee.    In the meantime... I look forward to Donnie Yen's next project.

0451196716|5.0|Although King does not count among my favorite writers I had followed Amazon ratings and found this time that most readers were right. King has achieved in this special book, out of an original idea a blend of a captivating story turned it into a superb thriller, featuring his always gruesome, grizzly depictions and at the same time making an entertaining product. Once, I started out \\"The Long Walk\\" I could not stop reading it and gobbled it up in just one week, because through the development of the plot I discovered that is the kind of book that holds the promise of an exciting ending
B001GJOL22|5.0|I've seen Rush live at least 15 times (I stopped counting, and just go whenever I can). My first tour was Signals. I saw them for the Snakes And Arrows tour Twice (Auburn, WA & George, WA) this was by far my favorite tour, and now that it's on Blu-Ray, I had to have it.     It is as close to going to a RUSH show as you can get, without going (even better in many ways).    The quality of the surround sound and video are both excellent, the camera always seems to be in the right spot (I know, edited to look that way, but they did a great job).     The set list is PERFECT too, almost all my favorite RUSH songs are there (this is why I liked the tour so much).    If you like RUSH, even a little bit, you simply have to get this disc (buy a BRD player if you have to, it's worth it).
0307408833|3.0|I feel slightly torn about this book. I had pre-ordered it because I have Celiac and have loved every gluten-free thing I have tried at the Babycakes NYC Bakery. Most recipes for gluten free baked goods contain high amounts of sugar, or require mixing your own flours or are all kind of generic and blah. This book promised to be free of those things without compromising taste. However, I've found there's good and bad to being a different cook book.<br /><br />The Good:<br />It's beautiful; the photography is stunning, the products look amazing, it gets you in the mood to bake and have fun with it. I love the personality in it, I love the colour and food shots. It's so nice to have it feel part photo-book and part-recipe instead of the standard recipe books. And the size is nice whether you're cooking or curled up the couch reading up on it.<br /><br />The recipes are laid out really well; most are just a page which is nice for those of us who don't like long directions and 17 steps. The write-ups about the items and little stories are fun. The celebrity-endorsements are kind of weird (except the \\"fat pants\\" - that's pretty awesome).<br /><br />There are lots of different kinds of baked goods to make from cakes to cookies. Recipes I hadn't seen before that look incredibly delicious. No more boring cupcakes and cookies for me! The Myer Lemon and Cherry Cupcakes is on my baking list for sure.<br /><br />The not so good:<br /><br />As a few people have already said, none of Chapter 2 (scones) are gluten free and there's a couple more elsewhere that call for spelt flour. Although Erin makes a comment about spelt in the beginning of the book and how it's not gluten free, it seems odd to have as a tag line on the FRONT of the book \\"gluten free\\" - especially since it says \\"mostly sugar free.\\" I found this to be very misleading and I felt kind of left out. Maybe that sounds silly but when you're anticipating a gluten free cookbook and you can't use a whole chapter, it's disappointing.<br /><br />The ingredients are costly. I shop exclusively organic and at Whole Foods so high prices for ingredients aren't a new thing for me. But I found a lot of the ingredients in here either hard to find (even at Whole Foods) or very expensive. The soy milk powder she recommends for so many things is about $20 on average I've found (you can find it on Amazon). Coconut oil, which I already use, is about $10 a jar but her recipes can go through about half of it (a whole thing if you're making cupcakes + icing). A few of the supplies she mentions having on hand can also add up. I can understand using the best ingredients but it's something to consider when ordering this book. If you bake regularly or for a large family, your baked goods can add up quickly. GF baking isn't cheap by any standards but these recipes are definitely a little bit more.<br /><br />I followed the instructions perfectly for the cupcake (of course this would be first!) and, like another reviewer, I was really disappointed by the vanilla frosting. Looking at the photographs in the book and recalling what I ate at the bakery, I was so excited to make this but really disappointed in eating it (and it takes at least 6 hours to chill and then come to room temperature so there's no instant satisfaction). The cupcakes were OK.<br /><br />I haven't made any other recipes yet so I'm hoping the book redeems itself. I am very interested to try out the gingerbread and chocolate chip cookies (I just have to find some of the ingredients I haven't been able to find yet).<br /><br />In any event, I would re-purchase this book as it has inspired me to get back into baking, to have fun with it, and more importantly, to share what I bake with my friends. It really is a beautiful, inspirational little book but it does come with a few flaws that I can live with but wish I would have known about ahead of time so that I wouldn't have been disappointed and more prepared for what I was getting into (IE can't bake right after getting it if you don't generally have all the things on hand).<br /><br />(Update: Babycakes NYC has answered a lot of questions about the book on their site at [...]. I found this really helpful and hope it helps with the baking).<br /><br />Update 01/03/10: I purchased a Kitchen Aid stand mixer a couple of months ago and I have to say, that (along with some of the edits in the link above) have made a HUGE difference in baking and in the icing. I really think when using the coconut oil, you really need to mix it really well in order for great results. I tried some recipes using a regular hand mixer afterwards and just could not get the same results. I have since had success with the cupcakes, the icing, cakes and banana bread. Yes, a stand mixer is a huge investment as is baking using this cookbook. But, for me, it's been well worth it since I can eat sweets in a healthy way instead of a process (gluten free) mix way.n hand).

1439102813|5.0|Tears were streaming down my face as I read the last half of this book.  Such a bittersweet book...so very sad, but I am so glad to have read it.   It will make me a better person, and I want everyone I know to be able to experience this story.
1423101472|5.0|I LOVE this book.  It is filled with humor and action, and is packed with excitement.  This book will captivate you and transport you into exotic situations filled with dangers, greek monsters, and near death experiences.  I would rate this book 5 out of 5 stars.  I am going to say it one more time.  I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0618526412|3.0|This novel is compelling, but it is not great--an achievement in its own right perhaps.<br /><br />Readers of southern fiction will find familiar themes here: grim isolation, grinding poverty, quirky and freakish misfits, shocking violence, racism, small town provincialism, and gothic, lush beauty within the dirt, grime, and ugliness of the Jim Crow South.<br /><br />It is a novel that has moments of greatness--Mick's loss of innocence is particularly memorable--and the reader can really feel the anguish and futility in the lives of the main characters that few stories can match.  In the end, however, the novel is little more than a story of anguish and futility, which left this reader cold.<br /><br />Indeed, the novel is cold (that's not necessarily a bad thing given all the sentimental rubbish out there) but its message is especially frosty and decidedly unsentimental: love, happiness, and rich, deep, and abiding human relationships are an impossibility, and when such feelings and thoughts occur, it is fleeting and illusionary. Humans, it seems, will ultimately fail at anything and everything they attempt.<br /><br />Like Mick, Singer, Jake, Dr. Copeland, Portia, Willie, Biff, and everyone else in this novel... the best we can hope for is to just survive this life with our dignity intact.<br /><br />This book deserves to be read, but only once.  Its grim, existential tale doesn't need telling twice.
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|Not a hardcore fan, I really enjoyed this movie, a great reboot...... fun for serious and casual fans alike.<br /><br />Showing the origins of the classic Star Trek characters, this movie helps reintrouce us, as it's been a LONG time since following the adventures of.... say.... Sulu.  But you get to adventure with him now, and how.<br /><br />My wife is not a sci-fi fan by and large, but really enjoyed it as well.<br /><br />Karl Urban nails his Dr. McCoy impression, and thankfully, Chris Pine steers clear of Shatner, but gives the impetuous hothead performance without the melodrama.<br /><br />This is a great movie, and the only thing that didn't work for me was the romance.  Don't want to spoil that, but chances are, when you see this, you'll know exactly what I mean.<br /><br />Now enough reading..... go watch it!  Preferably on the big screen.
B001MYIXAC|2.0|I bought this movie based on NPR's (National Public Radio)recommendation. (Usually a good source for intelligent, interesting movies; however, this movie is neither).  Now, the movie was very shallow, generic, predictable, and greatly lacking in imagination. All the characters lacked depth and intelligence. This movie was plain and simple a case of \\"what you see is what you get.\\" Often you see a movie and think it will get better; well, this is one is one of those that never gets any better. You see the first five minutes and that is as good as it gets.    No mystery, no intrigue, just plain: kid bullied at school befriends vampire girl, vampire girl protects him and, in one of the most anticlimactic endings, kills the bad kids.  That is the whole movie, a great, great disappointment.
0439813786|5.0|As an adult reader, I found this book to be quite a refreshing surprise.  Yes, the book contains quite a bit of \\"dead space\\" and illustrations, but that's the author's point.  He has specifically stated that the book's format was an attempt to mimic the looks of silent films, which is a huge part of the plot.  Though the story is a lot shorter than the book is thick, it is an exciting and heart-warming one.  I think more stories need to be written like this for young readers--it is exciting, suspenseful, full of hope, and it is ****appropriate**** for all ages.  A great book to read aloud for little ones too.
B001H9JBW6|5.0|This fictionalized account of privacy in everyday life and how technology is changing things is right on the mark and very scary.  The story itself and the acting is top notch and the suspense will draw you right in.  If you are a thinking person who enjoys a good suspense movie that stays with you long after it is over then this DVD is for you.  You will want to watch it more than once.
B001K3JF7K|4.0|I have been progressivly disappointed with Diana's albums: too many \\"OK, its my turn for a mid-song solo again\\" (does every song have to have one or two?) and sleepy tunes.  Don't get me wrong, I would have loved to have been there in person for her Live in Paris performance.  But recorded it just doesn't seem right.  This album is a refreshing return to pure wind-down-after-a-long-day Diana music.  It may not be as upbeat as her first couple releases (which I enjoyed the most) but equally as talented in performance.
B001VB8UAE|4.0|I am a HUGE  Barbra fan, let me say. But I was disappointed with the Florida show. She is 64 - I get it. But her voice is not what it was.  Lets  remember the  FLAWLESS  Mgm  shows!  And Timeless was great. But I am just saying, this 2006 show was....well, let me just say, I'd rather remember Babs for other shows. I love her. And always will. But you have to know when to stop.
B001AVEJ1Y|4.0|I sat back and watched this movie and became one with it.  It was Star Trek, and it proves that the story can live on without the older actors.  It is not the actors, it is the story, the vision of the original writer that lives on.  Like the Superman movies, actor after actor, yet the story lives on.    I hope to see another Star Trek film.  I loved every minute of the movie and I was moved to tears when Kirk came onto the bridge with his old uniform as Captain, of the USS Enterprise.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|At the outset, I believe it's only fair to divulge that, as a general rule, I don't care for Country music.  That said, I really \\"dig\\" Shania Twain's hybrid of Rock & Country.  In my book she's one of the most talented female artists around in this day & age!<br /><br />The present album demonstrates her impressive range of skills in both types of songs as well as vocal abilities.  Rock ballads such as FOREVER AND FOR ALWAYS & FROM THIS MOMENT ON are popular @ weddings.  On the flip-side, songs such as WHOSE BED HAVE YOUR BOOTS BEEN UNDER? and HONEY I'M HOME are fun little jaunts.<br /><br />  UP! is a good song to listen to when you're feeling blue as it's meant to lift your spirits & convince you that this crazy life is not going quite so badly as you're inclined to think it is.  It also \\"moves\\" nicely and reminds me of something that you'd find on [[ASIN:B000H5TVO4 A Collection of Roxette Hits: Their 20 Greatest Songs!]].  That's a good thing in my book!<br /><br />I can't force myself to believe that Shania resembles the persona in ANY MAN OF MINE.  Rather, it seems to me that Shania is poking fun (in a tounge-in-cheek sort of way) at all of the women wandering around who epitomize what Billy Crystal in [[ASIN:B00003CXDC When Harry Met Sally]] would categorize as \\"High Maintenance.\\"<br /><br />As a guy, I have to admit the obvious:  Shania Twain is absolutely gorgeous.  That said, I would've never bought her album on this fact alone.  Unlike other stunning pop stars such as Britney Spears, Shania has an amazing talent & has some vocal nuances that few sopranos can imitate.<br /><br />While I could be way off the mark, Shania's personality seems to shine though her songs.  She seems like someone who would be great to go to a theme park & have fun with - and not JUST because she's a looker!  That's my take, anyway.<br /><br />So, if you're looking for a great string of songs written in a Rock / Country hybrid style, I'd can't recommend this album highly enough.  The fact that the songs are sung by a lovely human being is an added plus!a lovely human being is an added plus!
0375842209|5.0|It isn't often that we find a book that is truly unique....but this is one of them. The story is told by Death, which in itself sets this book apart. The images of the characters remain with you long after the last page. I found it hard to put the book down and read it in about 3 evenings. I won't ruin the book by telling the story, but you will not be disappointed if you buy this book. I am sure that I will read more Zusak books.
B0017MO10U|1.0|I didn't recieve the DVD at all, was really looking forward to watching it :(  makes me sad....... Wendy Johnson
B0012QCZ54|2.0|I will be part of the limited few who probably say that this movie just wasn't really good. I for one was bothered by the fact it had NO story line or real plot, because other than that, what did we really have? Five minutes of genuinely good dancing and 1+ hours of no real relationships between the characters. My first question was watching this film: Who is Andie? I did remember that she was the adopted sister of Tyler in the first movie? I guess that must've been it. Realistically, it did not tell me in the movie itself. Tyler shows up in one scene, but it still does not tell me, what happened to him? What happened to his girlfriend? How many years have passed? What happened to the other people they were living with? As I remember Andie, and Tyler were not the only people living with the foster parents. That's where my question started. Now onto the next part: where were the original teachers from MSA? The original principal? These were left unanswered. Apparently Andie became a street dancer with the four one O crew. The story line never told me what the relationship was between her and the leader? Was he her ex- boyfriend? Why did he care who she was hanging out with? When was the group formed? Generally, throughout the movie, too many questions were left unanswered for me and I failed to see the relationship between this movie and Step Up. I also found it strange that originally when Andie formed her new crew, they were BAD at dancing, and after 2 miraculous practices (that's what the movie showed) they became AMAZING. What I am trying to say is: this movie did not focus on the parts that it should have focused on. Like building relationships between characters or showing that these dancers practiced day and night to become good. To be honest, none of the dance moves were all that great. The ending 5 minutes in the rain where they dance was where I could say, good movie. The rest just wasn't really that good. Is it a bad movie? No, I have seen worse, was it worth getting on DVD? Probably not, because this is for me one of those watch once movies unless I want to learn a few dance moves.rth getting on DVD? Probably not, because this is for me one of those watch once movies unless I want to learn a few dance moves.

0307408833|4.0|I commented on an earlier review below, which pointed out that all the recipes in this cookbook are actually NOT gluten free, as the title implies, because they use spelt flour. I knew spelt products were offered at the bakery, but assumed the cookbook would contain both gluten free and spelt versions of each.<br /><br />I have celiac disease and wanted to be able to quickly identify which recipes I can't use, so I highlighted them (both the flour ingredients on the recipe pages, and the page numbers on the chapter header pages) - spelt recipes pink, gluten free recipes yellow.<br /><br />Some sort of notation like this in the second edition would be helpful. As well as some information on how to substitute for the spelt flour in any of these recipes, if that's even possible (personally, I don't think I'll bother trying). And if it isn't possible, at least a sentence saying so. And of course adding a \\"Mostly\\" in front of \\"Gluten Free\\" in the book title, or some sort of subtitle/disclaimer indicating that all the recipes are NOT gluten free.<br /><br />In any case, I decided to buy the book despite the spelt recipes and all the Bob's mix and garbanzo fava flour, which I've never been a big fan of. I know it will be a good resource for special occasions when I have the time and money to make some of these baked goods. This is also just a really lovely cookbook, I so appreciate that it contains photos of most of the recipes! And I can't help but like this girl for opening the bakery in the first place, and then sharing her gluten free recipes.<br /><br />I thought I'd make a list of the specific gluten and not gluten free recipes in the book, for those who aren't able to look through the cookbook at a bookstore before buying it. Because had I ordered it not knowing that 1/3 of the recipes were not gluten free, I'd have been pretty bummed upon receiving it. Cupcake frosting and drink recipes are all gluten free.

B001F290E4|5.0|I love this CD. Lots of great old songs sung pretty much as you remember them. I listen to this CD all the time. If you don't like oldies, this is not the music for you.
1416562605|3.0|I greatly looked forward to receiving this book and anticipated the great writing, the suspense, etc everyone was talking about.<br />I found the novel to be mildly amusing, at best.  I suppose it gives us a snapshot of modern life in India....but that is only my supposition.<br />The writing style was deliberately simple to ape the outlook and experience of the narrator so it is difficult to imagine what the author could do with real characters, a real plot, or god forbid....subplots.<br /><br />My real rating is a 2.5.  It definitely does not deserve at 3.
B00005JPSM|5.0|My husband picked this movie up without me knowing by just reading the back of the DVD.  I had never heard of it before but it turned out to be really good.  Of course it is typical, but what movie of this genre isn't?  It is a little funny and the three main characters are a pleasure to watch.  I also love baking/cooking so maybe that helps steer my opinion.  Anyway, well worth the watch and it will make it into my regular rotation of good chick flicks!
B001AVEJ1Y|1.0|Well, i dont wanna go over the story, the acting, the special effect or all the other odd things i saw in this movie...just let me say i dont like it, and to make things clear im am, or should i say was a StarTrek fan (for many years). Its really sad that it had come to this, so my advice to all the StarTrek fans is, forget this movie. This was truly one of the worst i ever saw.
031606792X|4.0|Without giving anything away, there were a lot of cool things happening in this book.  The chemistry between Bella and Edward and Jacob is awesome! As much as I wanted to keep reading, I was also afraid to finish because it's the last book of the saga.  About 3/4 of the way, I kind of felt it was beginning to drag, but at the same time, I really couldn't put it down.     Stephenie Meyer is one of the best authors I have come across. I can't wait to see what she publishes next.  In the meantime, I plan on reading the series again.
B001PPGAIA|1.0|Did this movie get any better after the first hour?  I wouldn't know, it was all that I could handle with just the first 60 minutes.  This was just a very poorly done movie and despite my interest in seeing Nicole Kidman, her high brow English accent and stiffness grated on my nerves.  They made a mistake turning this into a comic book style of adventure story.  It would have been better to take it more seriously and give the peripheral characters more...well, more character!  At least it was only a single buck wasted from Red Box and not the price of a movie ticket.

B001ILFUDC|5.0|I remember getting this movie at age 4 (back when there were VHS tapes and when Nightmare Before Christmas was going to be in theaters) and watching it constantly. But the only two things I didn't like about it was the Coachman (who still scares me btw) and Monstro the whale (this started my phobia of whales).   Now in my early 20s, I decided to watch it to see if I've gotten over my fear. I had mixed feelings on getting a copy of this movie on dvd because of the Politically Correct Parents in the world might ruin it (no smoking, no drinking, no Jiminy Cricket saying his jack+++ line). But I heard from people saying that everything was kept the way it was (thank god).   I bought a copy of the movie and it was more beautiful than I remembered. As soon as you hear Jiminy sing When you wish upon a star, I felt I was 4 years old all over again. The art was magnificant and the storyline was wonderful.  Anyone wanting to show their child a classic Disney film, go for this. This classic film is much better than the newer stuff like the over-rated Madagascar, the very bad Space Chimps, or anything by Pixar (to me, CGI has no beauty in it, I call it the lazy way of animating). Trust me, this movie has no toilet humor.  Enjoy!
1423101472|5.0|If you're reading this, hopefully you would have read books 1-4 of the Percy Jackson series.  If not, now's a good time to go buy the previous books (for the thrifty, go for the first 3 in the paperback boxed set [[ASIN:1423113497 Percy Jackson and the Olympians Paperback Boxed Set (Books 1-3)]]).  I say this, because this book really isn't meant to be read without the knowledge of the previous books.  The actions of the past books, the relationships, the meetings, what they learned, not much of that makes sense if you don't read the previous books.  I won't put up major spoilers here, but something simple like not knowing why Kronos is in the body of a teenager would really throw off a read of book 5.<br /><br />As my title suggests, however, that's exactly what makes this book great.  It's broken down into 5 books, but they are definitely interconnected, so that they aren't so much like 5 episodes of a TV show like Seinfeld, but more like episodes of 24.  Can't really watch just the last hour, right?  Well, this books takes great lengths to tie together the strands of the entire series, making seemingly insignificant details from an earlier book into critical revelations in book 5.  It explains actions from earlier books, fills the gaps left in the earlier books.  I like to be entertained when I read a book, and I was definitely entertained here.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to the 10 and over age, although if you're not used to books of this length, perhaps 6th grade may be more appropriate as a starting point for this series (my 4th grader started reading this series when he was 10, but he's a great reader).
0226264211|5.0|Milton Friedman, Capitalism and Freedom (University of Chicago Press, 1962 [2002]).<br />Capitalism and Freedom is the product of a lecture series given by Milton Friedman in 1956 and published in book form in 1962. It is Friedman's greatest work in political philosophy, and it may take its place in history beside side the works of Hobbes, Hume, Locke, and Mill. The past half-century has produced nothing else of its caliber in the realm of political economy. Friedman's intellectual mentor, Friedrich von Hayek, wrote important works in this area in an earlier period, but his writings are today mostly of historical interest except to the expert. Capitalism and Freedom vibrates with life and relevance, and may do so for a very long time.<br /><br />Friedman has some difficulty in applying a name to his brand of political philosophy. He does not like `conservative' because he advocates change, not a return to the past. He balks at `liberal,' because he might be confused with his greatest enemy, American big-government social democracy, which calls itself `liberal.' In the end, he opts to call his position `liberal' because of its affinity to and inspiration by the classical English liberals, Locke, Smith, and Mill. I think a better term might be `classical liberal.' I am told that in his later years, Friedman identified with the libertarian movement, and indeed several of his policy suggestions have a distinctly libertarian flavor. But he is no libertarian.<br /><br />In this review, I will sketch the most sophisticated social democratic (i.e., modern liberal) position that Friedman so cogently criticizes in this book, ably represented by the classic statement of Robert Dahl and Charles Lindblom', Politics, Economics and Welfare, 1953. I will then outline and assess Friedman's position, and finally present what I believe to be the correct position, which we have the privilege to formulate on the basis of the above brilliant contributions and some sixty years of historical experience.<br /><br />According to contemporary economic theory, under the appropriate conditions, a decentralized market economy is the \\"best of all possible worlds\\" in the sense that every market equilibrium is economically efficient and any feasible distribution of income and wealth can be attained by a suitable initial distribution of the ownership of resources, followed by market competition. This is called the Fundamental Theorem of Welfare Economics. There are two practical problems with this theorem. First, in practice in a private property society, we cannot simply redistribute ownership by arbitrary fiat to achieve egalitarian goals, however democratically constituted. Thus, a private property market economy may inexorably generate social inequalities, and there may be legitimate successful mechanisms for achieving egalitarian ends through means other than the wholesale redistribution of private wealth (e.g., progressive income taxation and estate taxation). Second, real economies have certain \\"market failures,\\" causing the Fundamental Theorem to fail. Among these are externalities, such as pollution and atmospheric warming, caused by the fact that unregulated firms do not pay for the damages they cause to the environment. Other sources of market failures include natural monopolies based on increasing returns to plant size or the public good nature of the product, such as national defense and power generation, that undermine the competitive process, because unregulated markets lead either to no production at all, or to a single firm driving out all others in the industry. The modern liberal position, supported by contemporary economic theory, is that the state should step in to correct these market failures, and thereby maximize social welfare.<br /><br />Because there are in fact many varied forms of market failure, the modern liberal political philosophy offers no protection against the emergence of a huge state sector with its power reaching deep into the system of private production, consumption, and exchange. Moreover, correcting market failures is much more difficult that it appears at first light, and there are often \\"state failures\\" prevent effective intervention. Thus, it is often is better to endure the market failures we have than to apply state interventions that aggravate rather the mitigate the market failures (e.g., state regulatory commissions are often captured by the industry itself and used to private advantage). It is this possibility of pervasive state failure that motivates Milton Friedman's critique and alternative.<br /><br />Friedman's major thesis is that there is an \\"inescapable connection between capitalism and democracy\\" in the sense that not only do the two forms of decentralized popular control have an elective affinity as forms of democratic empowerment, but also unconstrained governmental power to supplant the market undermines political democracy and ultimately leads to dictatorship. Capitalism, then, is a prerequisite for freedom.<br /><br />Friedman's minor thesis is that the role of government in a free society is properly limited to maintaining law and order, preventing coercion of one individual by another, enforcing private property and contracts, and providing for the common defense and a common monetary system. Friedman is not an unwavering ideologue on these points, and freely admits that when a society has social goals that cannot reasonably be satisfied through decentralized market activity but can be accomplished through government intervention, then it is legitimate to attempt a solution through political channels. He counsels, however, that when the unintended consequences of market interference are taken into account, there will be few cases in which such intervention will be indicated. Moreover, when it is indicated, the most effective intervention is likely to be one that maximally depends upon the market and decentralized decision-making for its implementation.<br /><br />Friedman gives several arguments in favor of his major thesis. The first is that economic freedom, the ability of consumers to buy and sell whatever they think best meets their needs and furthers their goals, is a \\"component of freedom properly understood,\\" (p. 8) and hence its abrogation is a curb on freedom. For instance, if the government imposes a quota on a good that I would like to purchase but cannot because its price has become prohibitive, my personal freedom is curtailed. Similarly, if the government forces people to use the government-provided postal service, then my freedom to set up a competitive business in competition with the government service is curtailed.<br /><br />This argument has been criticized on the grounds that an interventionist government that increases the purchasing power of the less-well-off increases the economic freedom of the overwhelming majority of citizens, so the only individuals hurt by such an intervention are the relatively well-off, who are least damaged by restrictions on their economic freedom. This is a be a manifestly reasonable counter-argument, so Friedman's position is plausible only if government interventions are unlikely to improve the purchasing power of the less well-off, which is a clearly empirical matter. While there is some dispute over the matter, it appears that that, at least for some period of time after WWII, European social democracies effectively redistributed income away from the rich. Thus Friedman's \\"economic freedom\\" argument is tenuous. Nevertheless, some state interventions, such as prohibiting private mail delivery services, do fall clearly under Friedman's critique of illegitimate state interference.<br /><br />Friedman's second argument is that the ability of government to intervene at will in the market economy directly threatens political democracy by limiting the ability of citizens to assess government behavior and to dissent from the practices of the current regime. For instance, if the government controls who can and cannot be hired, this power can be used to impose penalties on its political enemies. For instance, the US government after WWII forced the movie industry to blackball writers and actors who were considered political enemies, thus curtailing the political freedom of American Communists and their \\"sympathizers.\\" This may seem reasonable given the threat Communism posed to liberal democracy (I actually do not agree with this position), but the same methods were used to criticize and smear opponents to the Vietnam War and many other legitimate political groupings. A sufficiently powerful government can also refuse to allow citizens access to the communications media by closing down oppositional newspapers, radio, and TV stations, thus effectively threatening those who disseminate information to conform to the current regime's preferences.<br /><br />Friedman also argues that a strong market economy creates a powerful basis for the decentralization of power, as the wealthy on the one hand, and masses of citizens on the other, have the means in a market economy to mount an effective opposition to arbitrary state power.<br /><br />I believe Friedman's argument here is very strong. Some would argue that the tendency for state economic power to undermine political democracy can be adequately curbed by an effective system of civil liberties and a secure separation of powers between executive, judicial, and legislative branches of government. This is a speculative argument with little in the form of supporting empirical evidence. I would argue that the threat that the government monopoly of economic power has to erode civil liberties and the separation of powers is too great to entertain any economic-political system that includes massive undermining of the private market economy.<br /><br />Friedman has rendered plausible that the diversification of economic power away from the state is an integral element of political and civil freedom. This is Friedman's most important contribution to political theory, and it rivals the pronouncements of the great political philosophers of the past. Of course, one can find echoes of Friedman's position in the classical literature (e.g., Locke's critique of Hobbes' defense of monarchy), but I have found nothing as persuasive as Friedman's argument.<br /><br />Of course, capitalism is not the only economic system that places economic power outside the all-powerful state. A system of worker controlled firms, each the owner of its own capital stock, is an obvious alternative, as is a system in which local communities own the capital stock and control local industries is another. However, after having spent several years attempting to implement such alternatives, I have come to the conclusion that these are not viable alternatives to capitalism (Samuel Bowles and Herbert Gintis, Recasting Egalitarianism: New Rules for Communities, States, and Markets, 1999). It is worth continuing to explore alternative effective mechanisms for the separation of economic and political power. However, until such an alternative is found, capitalism, accompanied by strong constitutional limitations on the government to intervene in the economy, and accompanied by a separation of powers and a healthy federalism that confers upon local regions fundamental and inalienable powers, all qualities of the US system of government, is the most conducive to human freedom among the forms of government that we know.<br /><br />Friedman support his minor thesis by arguing that the consumer sovereignty promoted by the market economy allows all individuals to achieve their preferred outcomes at the same time, without the need for all to submit to the same allocations through political fiat. In other words, the market \\"permits unanimity without conformity.\\" (p. 23) Friedman's argument, based on the efficacy of the market system rather than a notion of the \\"inalienable rights\\" of citizens to unrestricted voluntary exchange, is both flexible and defensible. It allows the government to intervene, for instance, when market failures render market allocations socially costly, and it allows the government to outlaw markets in, say, body parts, recreational drugs, sexually exploitative literature and videos, and the like.<br /><br />The most important fact about Friedman's minor thesis is that the general notion that the free enterprise system, as opposed to economies where the economy is basically run by the state (e.g., state socialism) has proven to be absolutely, incontrovertably correct. For an extended empirical argument to this effect, see Andre Schleifer, \\"The Age of Milton Friedman,\\" Journal of Economic Literature 47,1 (2009), pp. 123-135.<br /><br />The free-market era really began on a world scale in about 1980, coinciding with the election of Margaret Thatcher in England, Ronald Regan in the US, and the Deng Xiao Ping market reforms in China. World per capita economic growth, which had been very slow in the post-WWII period, began to rise at a 2% rate in 1985, continuing through to receont years. Moreover, this growth was confined to countries with free market ecconomies, which excluded most of Africa and the Middle East. Russian economic growth accelerated about a decade later, coincident with its era of market reform. Ireland's spectacular economic growth, for instance, can be completely attributed to its free-market reforms.<br /><br />However, Friedman is not content to criticize state socialism and traditional non-market economies. He uses his political philosophy, in particular his minor thesis, to make quite specific policy recommendations within a fundamentally market-oriented economy (pp. 35--36). The remainder of the book is an elaboration upon these recommendations. The most serious indictment of Friedman's political philosophy is that many, if not most, of these recommendation, have been systematically violated in the USA in recent decades, and the results have be overwhelmingly positive and supported by the vast majority of Americans. This indicates that Friedman's minor thesis is in need of serious recasting if we are to accept it at all.<br /><br />The first four of Friedman's fourteen explicit recommendations are largely valid and supported by our experience in the past sixty years. These express opposition to (a) price supports; (b) quotas in international trade; (c) government control of output; and (d) rent control. Similarly, his thirteenth proposal, which would allow competition in the delivery of the mail, seems eminently reasonable, as does the eleventh, which advises against conscription into the military in peacetime. However, the remaining eight recommendations are prohibitions on measures that in fact have proven to be strong contributors to the well-being of citizens, and enjoy widespread popularity.<br /><br />Some of Friedman's recommendations seem doctrinaire to the point of being frivolous. These include his opposition (point seven) to regulation of radio and television speech by the FCC, his critique of state licensing of professionals (point 9), and of state control of National Parks (point 12) and toll roads (point 14). Of course, these state practices can be  misused and overused, but they surely have a legitimate place in the good society.<br /><br />Perhaps the most dramatic of Friedman's recommendation in the current environment, which in 2009 characterized by severe economic instability set off by a massive financial failure in the housing sector, is Friedman's sixth point: prohibition against the \\"detailed regulation of banking.\\" There has been a large general increase in the amount of financial regulation since Friedman wrote in the 1950's, and most students of the subject believe that this body of regulation has contributed critically to the stability and efficiency of the financial sector. Virtually all experts today,  fairly independent of location in the political spectrum, hold that to avoid a reoccurrence of our current crisis, there must be increased financial regulation, and many believe the current financial failure was caused by loosening of financial regulation in the preceding period., Of course, another part of Friedman's sixth point is the inadvisability of detailed regulation of industry, especially by the Interstate Commerce Commission. Here Friedman appears to be correct: the loosening of Federal restriction on trucking, aviation, and communication has been salutary.<br /><br />Friedman's eighth point is that the social security system should be eliminated. This has not happened either in the USA or in any other industrial democracy. Social security programs, in which individuals are obligated to save for their retirement years, are popular among electorates, and modern behavioral game theoretic empirical results explain clearly that excessively short time horizons (excessive in the sense that individuals later would prefer to have saved more earlier) lead most individuals to undersave for the future, thus justifying public social security systems (justify in the sense that individuals will vote to have this system, even though it restricts their own personal saving decisions).<br /><br />Another of Friedman's proposal in the same vein is number ten which says that the government should not promote home ownership. Most students of the subject believe that the high frequency of home ownership achieved through mortgage availability and preferential tax provisions have contributed positively to the health of communities and a high level of local community political and social activity. Home ownership is a positive externality for local communities because individuals are more active in community affairs when they are home owners, if only because the value of their property is strongly affected by the quality of community life.<br /><br />Surprisingly missing from Friedman's list is the prohibition of laws creating artificial monopolies in general. I assume this is an oversight, because Friedman devotes the whole of Chapter 8 to this issue. I believe the classical liberal opposition to collusion in the restraint of trade is one of its most powerful principles. Concerning business, it was Adam Smith who said \\"People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices...\\" Friedman's position on labor unions (pp. 121ff) is that they are a similarly undesirable monopoly, but they have limited power in a competitive economy.<br /><br />It is clear, then, that Friedman's minor premise is wrong. It is not systematically wrong, but rather, somewhat like the proverbial broken clock that is correct exactly two times a day, it is randomly right and randomly wrong.<br />What, then, is the proper framework for assessing the proper role of government in liberal capitalist society? I believe that the following issues are central. First, the comparative advantage of the state is its monopoly of the means of law-making and coercion, so the state should fix and regulate the rules of the game according to which the private economy operates. This implies that the government should not enjoy a monopoly in the production of anything that could not be produced through the competitive market process. This means, for instance, that the government can legitimately provide universal health insurance, but it cannot monopolize the delivery of health care. Similarly, the government can guaranteed the funding of the educational system, but it should not run schools unless these schools are forced to compete on an equal footing with privately run, for-profit or non-profit schools. This implies that voucher school systems should be the rule.<br /><br />Second, the state should not interfere in the competitive market system unless there are clear and recognized market failures, of the sort that are fully analyzed in standard economic theory. In particular, the state should not create natural monopolies that favor particular groups at the cost of the general public. This means, for instance, that laws favoring labor unions' ability to collude in the restraint of trade should not be countenanced. This does not imply the abolition of labor unions, but rather prohibits them from colluding across individual firms. The general protection of the rights of workers can be adequately addressed through general laws, including minimum wage and occupational safety and health laws, that apply across the board to all workers. Most important, public sector unions with bargaining rights should be prohibited.<br /><br />Third, when there are market failures, such as externalities, creating problems of urban zoning, environmental pollution, and the like, and natural monopolies, such as national defense and power generation, there is a prima facie case for active government intervention. However, what has been called \\"state failure,\\" meaning the tendency for the state to act on behalf of special interest groups rather than the public as a whole, can render such interventions undesirable in many cases.<br /><br />Finally, the state has the right and the duty to intervene in the private economy to protect and enhance the rights of those who are incapable of protecting themselves. This includes the young, the elderly, and individuals with physical or mental incapacities, although only when laws enhancing the power of private charitable interventions prove insufficient. In particular, the state should have great power to eliminate poverty, which I define roughly as a situation in which a fraction of the population are born into situations in which they lack the means for full self-development and healthy participation in social life.<br /><br />I suspect that I am missing some central principles for a defensible alternative to Friedman's irreparably flawed minor premise, and I invite other readers to offer additions and corrections.market failures render market allocations socially costly, and it allows the government to outlaw markets in, say, body parts, recreational drugs, sexually exploitative literature and videos, and the like.

B001YV502C|5.0|I'll say right up front that this is not the kind of film that will appeal to everyone. Many people apparently found it \\"boring,\\" though I was deeply moved and found it gripping throughout. The film's setpieces, especially the ambush in the forest and the street battle in the refugee camp, are amazing pieces of cinema that people will be talking about for years to come. They're not just virtuoso displays--they really pack emotional punch. The performances were uniformly excellent, but I was especially impressed by the production design and cinematography. Emmanuel Lubezki's camerwork is his best to date and really the best I have seen in years, with its subtle gradations of light and astounding long takes. There is no one more talented than him today.    I can't imagine watching this film on cable, or frankly even on DVD, because so much of its impact derives from its immersive, tactile quality. I saw it twice in the theaters, and will only watch it again on Blu-ray. It will never appeal to everyone, but I believe that in time it will be recognized as a modern classic.

Sensing the gents wanted to continue the work of Playing The Angel, and at first it works, then trails off lost in its own pretentiousness. Its like they just said whatever and this is the result. It seems unfocused, lazy, and incomplete, which I'm getting to next.    I'm a bit miffed that I cannot download the extra tracks for this album. I'm also displeased with how D.M. tailored 3 versions, just to milk more money out of the cash strapped public.     Lastly, I would have given this release a better review if all the material was included in the digital release.  Finally would all the record labels please release the stuff in one package one time so that everyone can get correct collection. This is just ridiculous.

B001DJ7PR8|5.0|Woody Allen has lost a lot of his initial spark from years past. His self-effacing cynicism has evolved into a somewhat mean-spirited display of cruel behavior. Each of Woody's films have been an homage to one classic director from cinema's past. \\"Match Point\\", a tribute to Hitchcock, was cold and bleak, with none of Hitchcock's wit and charm. If \\"Vicky C B\\" is an homage, I would say it is to Eric Rohmer, always devoted to that enigma that is \\"love\\". Woody has done a fine job here, and the casting is flawless. Rebecca Hall is especially good, but she's ably supported by Scarlett Johasson and Javier Bardem. The DVD I watched had NO extras. It's all silly, and rife with bad decisions, but it isn't until Penelope Cruz explodes on the scene, as the mysterious first wife, Maria Elena, that the film takes off. Unfortunately, her role wasn't as fully realized as I would've liked, but all of her scenes were enjoyable. I have no problem with her Oscar win. All in all, I thought \\"VCB\\" was more entertaining than most of Woody's recent films. He's still got it, but may be grasping for ideas. I would like to see him parody Alain Resnais as a comedy; that existential confusion of films like \\"Last Year at Marienbad\\" ('62) could be quite accessible in the hands of the brilliant Mr. Allen. Anyone remember \\"What's Up, Tiger Lily?\\"? NOTE: I read the script of \\"Last Year at Marienbad\\", with director's notes, and it made sense. First-time viewers of that film can only be perplexed and bored.

There's a lot of persuasive talk (and I believe that's how the diet books are written) but unlike some other diet books this one has an incredible and consistent message: The humans evolved to eat a certain diet; what we eat presently is contrary to our genes, thus all the \\"diseases of affluence\\"; thus, you eat what you ancestors ate.     Unfortunately, this is a standard diet book, and I wish the authors explore more and debunk the criticism of the Paleo Diet (for example, the role of abundance of calories and role of exercise), the book would be more credible. I would give it 3 1/2 starts, since the overall message of the book can take on a dozen of diet books put together.      By all means be familiar with this diet.

0143036556|5.0|You almost can feel the frustration the author pours into this book. As you would expect from Jared Diamond, the book is a well-researched, well-supported,scientific study with a peculiar sense of humor which I must admit I came to like. Providing a framework of five major factors that led the greatest civilization to collapse, the author warns that all five factors are not only present in the modern world but eerily and recklessly ignored by the societies who based on the accumulated knowledge about the history of past should probably know better. Highly recommended.

B000002LQR|5.0|Overall, RHCP is probably one of the single most influential bands in the history of music.  I've read some reviews stating that the band, (this album in particular) is just another has-been alternative rock band.  However, RHCP are way much more than just another alternative rock band.  Firstly, John Frusciante was ranked at number 16 on the Rolling Stone's top 100 guitarists of all time.  People are really only ragging on this album in particular because it was the first album to REALLY achieve mainstream success.  For some reason, people have it in their heads that as soon as a band achieves big success, they stop being good.  These people are idiots.  The music is undeniably great.  It has an edgy tone to it yet certain songs like \\"Under the Bridge\\" and \\"I Could Have Lied\\" show the versatility of the band.  Point and case, don't believe the \\"this band sucks\\" hype.   They are phenomenal and hopefully will forever be recognized for the great artists they are.

B000M4RG4C|2.0|The film begins with a lone soldier looking over the black sand. It is a flashback. Does a single picture win or lose a war? [No!] The famous photo of the flag raising was popular as it stood for victory over the enemy. One medic rescues a wounded soldier, then defends himself with a knife. [Irony?] There is a flashback to Camp Tarawa. The Marines are training for an invasion. Iwo Jima is heavily fortified. Mount Suribachi has the big guns and is an important target. The Navy shells the island with all guns. Can they take the island in three days? The Marines land without enemy fire - until they are exposed in the open. They neutralize a machine gun nest. The wounded are carried back for treatment.    Those who raised the flag in that picture were sent back to the states, if they survived. They were used for publicity to sell war bonds. The need for money is explained. They meet President Truman. Allied armies were then in Germany. [Did people expect the war was about to end?] Another flashback explains the second raising of the bigger flag. There is more drama back in the states during the bond drive. The survivors are encouraged to help in the effort. The capture of Iwo Jima allowed its use as an airfield for bombers. The film then shows their lives after the war. They were yesterday's heroes. The film winds down in a sentimental ending.    This film recreates the invasion of the island. Computer-generated images created realistic backgrounds for this film. The story suffers from too many jumps in continuity or flashbacks. The end of the credits says \\"dialogue and certain events and characters contained in the film were created for the purpose of dramatization\\". \\"The Sands of Iwo Jima\\" remains the best film about this event and will never be surpassed because of its nearness to the event. And it had a better director, producer, and writers. This film is cynical in treating the flag raising as just a publicity device for fund raising. [Were Americans not buying enough war bonds in 1945 given that rationing and other factors limited what they could do with their money.]
1594481717|5.0|A Whole New Mind by Dan Pink really gave me a better idea of what is happening in our culture today. I am now looking at things with an enhanced understanding of important trends currently taking place.     Indeed the concept of heading toward more of a right-brain focused society is intriguing and refreshing. Everything, in my opinion, takes on a deeper breadth of joy and fulfillment as we implement design, story, symphony, empathy, play, and meaning into our work and life in general.     It fits in well with my business of helping people discover and work at what they love.     Sherrie Porterfield  [...]
B001H5X7KC|4.0|First off, this movie is hilarious... Robert Downey Jr is top-notch and the way they skewer Hollywood is simply fantastic. The one thing that bothers me aout this film is it actually made me start liking Tom Cruise again! Nooooooo!!! lol Ben Stiller's character is basically making fun of Tom Cruise, RDJr's is lampooning Russel Crowe, Jack Black is sending up Andy Dick and I wasn't sure who the other two were lampooning as much (Maybe Ludacris?) but it doesn't matter because the movie was great.     The Blu-Ray release is exceptional in it's crisp, bright colors. There are no artifacts or jittery frames, the audio is excellent as well and all aroudn a great purchase!
B000W91RUG|4.0|The complete first season of what I think is a great new TV show. It is a good insight of what being a geek means (IMO). The characters are all great and the show is hilarious. I can't wait to buy the Second Season!

I have been using this just about three times a week, cause it kicks butt!  I pride myself on being a long distance walker, but it is important to keep up the strenght training as well.  With diet and exercise I have dropped 11 pounds so far, am feeling stonger and my endurance is way high!  I would recommend this to anyone who wants a gooooood, strong, FAST workout.  Love that it's only 20 minutes and you're dead, I mean done!  Hah!

B001EN71DG|4.0|It took me a long time to finally decide to buy this box set.  I read the reviews, and agonized over the changes done to the original films.  I was also a bit upset over the fact that the unaltered films on the bonus disc were non-anamorphic.  These things seemed like deal breakers.      I was wrong.  After watching the \\"remixed\\" versions again, I found them to be just as entertaining as the original versions.  Sure there are some differences that may prove fatal for some (ie. Han vs Greedo) but frankly, I find all the complaining over that a bit silly.    This set has both positive and negative points.  I really liked how the film was changed in some parts to include contemporary footage (from the 70s and 80s) originally shot by lucas but cut from the film (ex. Luke talking to Biggs in A New Hope).  I also liked how crisp and clean the visuals were.  Some of the new CGI footage does add to the movies, making transitions cleaner or adding depth to a scene.      However, I did not like how some of the CGI scenes were total garbage.  The comic relief scenes of droids at Mos Eisley and the brief musical performance at Jabba's palace are the main offenders.  Also, swapping in Hayden Christensen as Vader's ghost at the end of Return of the Jedi was not a good move in my opinion.  Logically it doesn't make sense.  Aged Obi Wan dies and we get a ghost that accurately portrays him.  Old Anikin dies, and some how we get young Anikin as his ghost?  I know you want us to accept the prequels but please!    Overall, I'm very pleased with this set.  If you have yet to purchase Star Wars on DVD, I'd recommend this version.  Should you be totally opposed to the remixed films, at least you can fall back on the non-anamorphic originals.  The only reason it gets 4 out of 5 is due to the silly comic relief scenes I mentioned earlier.
B0017I1FNK|1.0|I can't get enough of this wonderful artist.  I must have played \\" I could never be gold \\" a dozen times in a row. There are many other great cuts on this CD. I enjoyed them all.    Grab one of these if there are any left.
B000002JSJ|4.0|First my opinion can often be a handycap. Second Ive owned thousands of albums. Third I find it better to not compare albums by the same band but to albums overall that i have listened to over the last four decades. My favorite album by Zep is and will always be the 1st one. That has no baring on my opinion of this album. The only reason i decided to write this is after reading all the bad reviews. Every bad reviewer demonsrtated his love of other pieces by the band and felt this didnt measure up to previous efforts. Should it? Thank God Zepplin grew and changed over the years. They created great moments and great albums. I have found that this album grew on me over the years more than any other. If I compare it to the thousands of albums Ive lietened to it rates at least four stars. I finally got a RL  copy of the second album and its true, its a great mastering job. To compare the two albums would be a mistake, for me anyway. Love this record.
0345350472|4.0|It's generally acknowledged that Philip K. Dick wrote two kinds of novels: good ones and bad ones.  The good ones take a worthy plot device and swing the reader around on a whirlwind plot of surprises, inversions, and mysteries.  The bad ones get bogged down in a mess with too many characters and subplots and not enough reference points to hang on to.    Rick Deckard is a bounty hunter in post-apocalyptic Los Angeles, assigned to hunting down androids that have escaped from colonized planets.  Yet the job is not nearly as glamorous as a Harrison Ford movie might suggest.  Deckard has a depressed housewife at home, an artificial sheep, and a host of financial problems.  Worse still, a new brand of android called the Nexus-6 is on the loose, and it can barely be distinguished from a real human being.    Rick's daily grind will take him through a serious of encounter with androids who turn manipulative, violent, and highly personal.  As has been often said, Philip K. Dick plunged right into the possibilities that other science fiction authors ran away from.  What happens if there's no way to distinguish androids from humans?  Could Rick himself be an android?  Could everybody be an android?    But even while juggling this amazing array of frightening possibilities, \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\\" manages to be one of Dick's most hilarious efforts.  Several punchlines come out of nowhere to leave the reader on the floor with giggles.  It is to his credit that Dick can toss these lines into scenes that are drowning in despair and morbidity.    (Lastly, make certain that you buy the edition written by Philip K. Dick and only him.  There's another edition drifting around, with the text mangled by a malicious editor, who bears the name of 'Andy' Hopkins, thus proving that fate does have a sense of humor.
B000002KKK|5.0|When compiling (and altering) the back catalog for the ZZ Top: Six Pack back in 1987, they skipped over Deg&uuml;ello - and left it alone.  No remixed or rerecorded tracks, no extra reverb, no \\"Afterburner\\" style fuzz tone.  This is ZZ Top in all their 1979 glory!  This 1990 release might not have the catchphrase \\"remastered\\" but the mastering job is just fine - so don't hesitate to pick this up this CD.

0762434279|5.0|Thanks to this book, I can honestly say that I'll never work for someone else again. Listen, the best education you'll ever receive in your life won't come from a classroom, it'll come from the real world. There is no substitute for experience! I learned long ago that the only thing college teaches you is how to work for someone else. This book will teach you what they never taught you in school...how to work for yourself. It's long been debated whether there really is a rich dad and/or a poor dad but I say IT DOESN'T MATTER!!! The common sense approach to the real world and what you need to do to get ahead are the only things that really matter. Kiyosaki delivers with Rich Dad, Poor Dad...period. It is the lemons you need (along with the guidelines to follow) in order to make life's lemonade. Buy it, get motivated, then start your own business. What are you waiting for? Your pink slip is coming! Become layoff proof today!!!
1400064287|3.0|Well, I appreciated the evidence this book provided about the power of stories and details, but sorry Chip and Dale, I think you are speaking about fast media ideas and not the kind that matter to me.<br /><br />It may be true that slogans like, \\"nice guys finish last\\" catch on for reasons other than that they are accurate, and it may be that stories are more effective than distilled oration, and it may even be true that appealing to emotions is more effective that facts, but if all these things are true, it is one more reason to give up on trying to say anything important at all.<br /><br />Important ideas benefit from stories, concrete details, and simplicity, that is true, but some of the greatest ideas are interesting because they are not simple or concrete. Maybe the most important ideas are about mystery, logic, connections, and those perceptions and ways of seeing that are out front of the crowd, just on the horizon of realization. Slogans like, \\"nice guys finish last,\\" and other ideas people like to use to justify their aggression or competitive nature, may make the ideas memorable, but is \\"sticking\\" the most important thing when the idea is only half baked?<br /><br />Instead, I think this book is about solipsism. The art of persuasion. This really has nothing to do with real ideas which are often notoriously hard to remember because  they are new, beyond our current way of thinking, revolutionary, without equals.<br /><br />All the other stuff is an interesting study of human shortcomings, our inability to think abstractly, our inability to focus on a line of reasoning, our tenancy to rely on irrational ways of knowing over analysis and careful observation.<br /><br />In essence the book is about justifying a culture of quick influence, easy selling, advertising, and the instant answer. It is a white flag in the battle for clear perception.<br /><br />Where are the ideas that grab us, that transform our worlds. I didn't see many in this book, nor an analysis of how those ideas are so effective. I'm thinking of relativity, the wheel, monotheism, cooking, municipal sewers, sports jackets -- I don't know, anything that has stood the test of time. There are millions of ideas like these that have changed our lives and imprinted themselves on our psyche. I don't think they did so just because they are  simple, unexpected, concrete, credible, emotional and told with stories. These can help a good idea along, but equally important glues are beauty, fit, innovation, artistry, brilliance, clarity, solutions, synthesis, robustness, comprehensiveness, etc.<br /><br />To the authors I might suggest that you simplified your subject but left out the best bits.thinking of relativity, the wheel, monotheism, cooking, municipal sewers, sports jackets -- I don't know, anything that has stood the test of time.

B00005JPTK|1.0|Good - Will Smith, an alternate cityscape, survival.  Sounded really good to me and the trailers were good.  The depressing book and film were required reading/watching in Jr.High, but this adaptation is more like a summary of the book and it isn't fair to compare what special effects were available back when Charlton Heston played the role so I won't go there.    Bad - The ending.  I had hoped they would change that part of the story - I looked forward to something better than status quo and I prefer movies (and books) that leave me satisfied, not wishing I'd stayed home and cleaned the kitchen.  If you feel the same way, don't watch this one.  I heard a rumor that 2-disc version will have an alternate (happy) ending.  If it does, I'll watch it.  If it doesn't I won't...ever.

B000TGQDZQ|3.0|As a fan of various symphonic, epic, \\"gothic\\", metal bands, such old Nightwish, Leaves' Eyes, and yes even Battlelore, perhaps my opinion has little weight. Epics female vocal are certainly more mature and classically brilliant than say, After Forever or the \\"new\\" Nightwish. I am a little dissapointed a the lack of diversity in arrangements throughout the album, as in comparison to Leaves' Eyes. You get the feeling that Bandss leader is trying to immitate Thuomas H. of Nightwish with the orchestrated rifs that sound a little cheap. And quite with the abrupt growling, as if this is a 50/50 M/F duo. Your voice is not the masculine toughness of a Viking as compared to Leaves Eyes or even Nightwish, rather its raggedly demonic and disturbing. That may play a role in some brief periodic lyrical struggle, but come on........<br /><br />Anyhow, Epic is good, it is not AS \\"pop\\" sounding as new Nightwish or Evanescence. Ok maybe i'll lean towards 4 stars, but definately not 5.
0307408833|2.0|The good points: The photos are lovely and the desserts look luscious.    The bad points: If you have a gluten-intolerance, you're not going to be able to eat a distressing amount of the luscious-looking goodies at all.    I bought this book because I wanted to branch out from your basic gluten-free baking. However, fully a third of these recipes are *not* gluten-free; they're made from spelt flour. Chapter two, which is the scone and biscuit chapter, has no gluten-free recipes at all. The pie crusts aren't gluten-free, the cobbler recipes aren't gluten-free, which just leaves me with recipes for desserts that I already had access to.     If I had known how many recipes were completely inaccessible to my family, there is no way I would have wasted the money pre-ordering this book. I'll donate it to my library. With a subtitle reading: Vegan, Gluten-Free, and (Mostly) Sugar-Free, I was fooled. Buyer beware.
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|Wow! Talk about breathing new life back into a franchise - with a bang!     The new Star Trek is action-packed, and truly has so many enjoyable things to offer any movie-go'er - Trekkie, sci-fi/fantasy fan, or otherwise. It's truly amazing how wide an audience they've pleased with this tremendous movie - the sales, end-to-end demographics of ticket-buyers, and critic reviews speak for themselves.     Acting: Great movies always mean great peformances by their actors, and these actors' candor and chemistry was tremendous from the start. They succeeded in so many challenging areas for a pre-quel, especially in an ambitious endeavor like a Trek prequel: actually creating likeable characters you care about or cheer for as well as giving long-time fans some nostalgia in their interaction and adventures together. The casting for this movie was tremendous, and the actors all deliver, astonishingly well.     Story: The story is far-reaching, as a pre-quel truly can and should be. A tremendous action-packed opening sequence that truly pulls you in, and from there you get to see several of the classic crew's key childhood events before making their way to Starfleet and manning ships as officers. You see it all, including of course, the many brushes and final showdown with the villain. The story unfolds richly, and yet the pace of the movie remains excellent, quickly moving to the next critical decision or conflict.     Atmosphere: They didn't skimp on this movie - from ship technology and furnishings, to combat special effects, to monsters, to hand-to-hand combat inside bars and miles in the sky, Star Trek's eye candy factor is high. Especially when you count Ahura as part of it!
B0015DWJ8W|3.0|I was a bit disappointed, this book is not up the standard of Murakmami's other titles.  I would have to summarize it as being mostly a running diary, and even though I am a runner I still didn't get a lot out of the book. It had very little 'story telling' or new insights and I skimmed over most of it.  I would recommend checking out his other titles unless you have read everything already and just want anything else you can find!    His nonfiction book 'Underground' was very good.  Wild Sheep Chase and Norwegian Wood are his best fiction, Kafka on the Shore is also quite good.
0307408833|3.0|I received this book as a birthday gift (after lots of hint dropping) and couldn't WAIT to get my hands on it.  I read it cover to cover the first chance I got and, like other reviewers, was incredibly disappointed to see I couldn't make a good number of the recipes, particularly the biscuits and scones and NO RED VELVET CUPCAKES!!     UPDATED REVIEW -   The photography in this book is really nice.  The celebrity reviews/endorsements are strange and seem to make the book try too hard.  The allergen-free reference isn't quite exact, if you're gluten intolerant then a lot of recipes aren't for you.      However, I did click around the BabycakesNYC website and came across an email address they created specifically for cookbook questions.  I got a prompt response about subbing out the Spelt flour along with suggestions for other kinds of oils I can use instead of Coconut, which is expensive.    I was little disappointed at first when I thought I couldn't bake all the recipes in Chapter Two and some of the cupcakes I wanted to try, but knowing now that I can sub out the flour and add Xanthan Gum I'm not as unhappy.    Maybe more info/suggestions/corrections will be taken care of in the second edition.  I hope so.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|Brainchild of JJ Abrams, this show is loaded with all the vitamins a good series needs: an exciting and innovative plot, along with well-scripted characters. Some episodes are a bit of a fill-out but the overall plot, much like the show Lost, is very interesting and has one at the edge of their seat. Anna Torv is a bit of a newcomer without much experience, but portrays her character very well. John Noble does a cracking job as the somewhat looney Einstein-inspired Dr Walter Bishop. The biggest surprise is Joshua Jackson who's getting a bit of a fresh start in his career with this show. He does an excellent job as the intelligent Peter Bishop, son of Walter Bishop. Another brilliant choice actor-wise is Lance Reddick, known from The Wire (which by the way probably is the best show in TV history).  The main plot? Well, strange incidents are occuring, perpetrated by a mysterious terrorist group using the world as their experiment lab. The events are investigated by the characters named above. As the story unfolds, the motives of this terrorist group start to emerge and the question rises: Who is the real enemy?   Scripted and created by the same guys who wrote the new Star Trek film, this show is the new Lost. It has been picked up for a season 2, and will probably go beyond that. Brilliant stuff.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I read the reviews of this book before I got it in the mail. I was prepared to be disappointed with the book before its end. But, I was in for the long haul. I loved the 1st 3 books, so I was going through my adventure with Bella and Edward and the rest of the Saga.   I LOVED the 4th book, it is my favorite of the 4 books. Yes....she is happy and there is a happy ending. What's wrong with that? I would rather it end good than bad. Either way, before its end, I was in tears. This was the thickest, longest book of the 4. I am glad that my adventure wasn't short lived. You would think that in this book Bella went straight for the good things and that was it. There were trials and tribulations in here as well, I mean come on...it's Bella after all....she is not the most lucky person with everything!   I think that you will agree and love this book as I do. Unless you are looking for a bad ending and hopes and dreams to be shattered, you should be pleased!  These books were most definetly a drug to me, and I am sad that they are over! I would love to have another book to continue my adventure with Bella and Edward!
0307454894|5.0|I was motivated to read \\"The Reader\\" after seeing the movie starring Kate Winslet and wasn't disappointed.  The author did a masterful job moving from various time periods in primary character's lives.  The plot focused on a young boy's first love with a woman twice his age and how their relationship developed as they grew older.  Both had to deal with a horrific incident that happened during with World War 2 and it was how it was handled that made the book very sad and poignant for me.
1572816295|4.0|My friend and Tarot teacher introduced me to this deck, and I found it beautiful and stirring on both an emotional and energetic level. Not only were the images gorgeous, but there was something magical that tugged at me after using them for a reading. Two days later, during a healing session with a client, one of the 'characters' from the deck showed up, and an image of one of the cards showed up in a body scan! This was very specific as to what type of healing crisis the person was in, and allowed me to specifically suggest a course of energetic balancing. I ordered the deck immediately afterward, knowing that I'd found a brand new tool to utilize within my practice.    The way the images are portrayed is fairly traditional, but I love where the deck varies, and the tiny, fey creatures that seem to add their own symbolism. This is really what drew me to the deck, and I'm quite happy with the readings I've done with it so far. The price is also amazingly affordable (read: a steal!) considering all the work and artistry involved. I highly recommend the Paulina Tarot to any and all readers who are looking for traditional, magical, beautiful and something quite out of the ordinary all rolled into one deck.
B0009S4IKQ|4.0|I found this film a very high-quality, well-appointed DVD product for the old movie collector or the Barrymore afficionado. John Barrymore at his romantic best as a movie star, probably in his waning years but nevertheless dashing and effective as the tarnished and destitute society leech and jewel thief. The scenes with Garbo are historic. And a young Joan Crawford is beguiling as an impressionistic secretary. Her beauty is mysterious and timeless. Great resolution in the transfer, clear and sharp and beautifully black & white. My research into John Barrymore's life and career was greatly enhanced by this DVD. Hopefully, archival material like this film will be marketed and promoted better in the future. We have a treasure in Hollywood films like \\"Grand Hotel.\\"
B000OYC3J8|1.0|I saw these people on the final NBC Conan O'Brien show. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I'm still not certain they aren't a joke. They were the worst-sounding group I've ever heard presented as professional musicians. Just abyssmal, ear-killing, retarded crap. Possibly a sign of the approaching nadir of all culture. It just occurred to me that fans of Icky Plop or whatever they're called might not know what words like \\"abyssmal\\" and \\"nadir\\" mean. Just look in a dictionary. Don't have a dictionary? Go to a library. Don't know what a library is? Just walk downtown, and when you see a grownup, ask.
1572815612|2.0|Being connected to a tarot deck is very important to me.  Nevertheless, I read tons of books on tarot like 78 degrees of wisdom, tarot reversals, joan burning books to build a solid foundation. Still, it doesnt talk to me when we are doing readings. I hate looking for the LWB everytime.     So I reach out to other tarot deck based on very loosely waite theme.  I finally find the tarot deck that speaks to me so clearly is Spiral tarot, Barbara Walker, Gill Tarot. Whenever I use these tarot decks, I never need to clarifying a meaning. They come to me.     Hence, I think I am not suitable to use Waite tarot, no matter in what versions. Even closely Waite cloned like Tarot of a Moon garden I cannot connect to.     So you may ask why can't I connect with this card?    I believe is that the colors seems to be on the same level of brightness, and no blending or contrast of colour, I cannot have an intuitive reading. Next, is the symbol like Church stuff I am not used to and feel distanced with. Lastly, I feel this tarot totally has so few females i cannot identify myself with. And the rigidity of the characters depicted do no allow my mind to wander.     Although I cannot connect with this card,you may still connect with it since it is a favourite among manys.     Studying about the symbols in this deck is also very beneficial as 90% of the tarots nowdays are based on this Waite tradition.

B00003CXPD|5.0|The Cortonwood Colliery in Yorkshire, UK,  closed in 1984. This was to be the first of 20 mine closures with the loss of 20,000 jobs. The UK Miners' Union responded by calling for a national strike, a major industrial action affecting the entire British coal industry. At it's height 165,000 miners were out on strike. In many communities miners' wives pushed the struggle forward, joining picket lines and arranging communal food kitchens. The Tory government used the state's resources to put more and more police into the coal fields and on the picket lines, frequently with violent and bloody consequences. After 51 weeks on strike, a special delegate conference of the National Union of Mineworkers voted by 98 to 91 votes to return to work. This was a defining moment in British industrial relations, and its defeat significantly weakened the British trade union movement. It was also seen as a major political and ideological victory for Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her Conservative Party. At one point during the strike, in a speech to Tory M.P.'s, Prime Minister Thatcher stated, \\"We had to fight the enemy without in the Falklands. We always have to be aware of the enemy within,\\" (referring to the striking miners), \\"which is much more difficult to fight and more dangerous to liberty.\\"<br /><br />It is against this grim backdrop that \\"Billy Elliot\\" begins. Eleven year-old Billy, (Jamie Bell), is the son of a widowed coal miner, (Gary Lewis). Their beloved wife and mother died the year before. Billy, his father, older brother, Tony, (Jamie Draven), and live-in grandmother, (Jean Heywood), reside in the fictional coal-mining town of \\"Everington,\\" in northeast England. The movie is actually shot in the real County Durham, UK. Billy looks after his grandmother, who has Alzheimer's, but never lets anyone forget that she could have been a professional dancer if marriage hadn't gotten in the way of her potential career. Cinematographer Brian Tufano does a magnificent job of depicting the beauty of the local, with its quaint brick houses and nearby green fields. The ocean can often be seen in the background as the characters walk through the streets. It's as if the picturesque surroundings can ameliorate the bleakness of the situation.<br /><br />The movie opens with Billy playing a recording of \\"Cosmic Dancer\\" by T-Rex. He exuberantly leaps and dances to the sound of the music as if to escape his oppressive surroundings. He deeply mourns the loss of his  \\"Mum,\\" and since both his Dad and brother are out on strike, the repressed anger and depression at home couldn't get much worse. As Billy runs outside to search for his wandering \\"Gran,\\" he sees, from the fields, a group of policemen, gathering, armed with riot shields and clubs. The threat of explosive violence is a constant throughout the movie, even with its wonderfully upbeat, and frequent comic moments.<br /><br />Billy takes boxing lessons at a local gym, to uphold the family tradition. Both his father and brother excel at the sport. Unfortunately, our young protagonist is not a chip off the old block, pugilistically speaking. His footwork is fabulous, but he really doesn't want to hit anyone. He is fascinated, however, by the ballet class which is being taught at the same gym. The irrepressible Billy takes a few classes, spending his 50 pence for dancing lessons rather than boxing. He even takes a book from the local library on ballet and practices the positions secretly in the bathroom. Stern, chain-smoking ballet mistress, Mrs. Wilkinson, (Julie Walters), immediately spots the boy's talent.<br /><br />Naturally, Billy's Dad discovers that his youngest son is not boxing. He also finds out what Billy is doing instead. Mr. Elliot is furious, and tells Billy, \\"Lads do football or boxin' or wrestlin'! Not friggin' ballet!\\" Billy responds, \\"It's not just poofs, Dad! Some ballet dancers are as fit as athletes.\\" Mr. Elliot is primarily angry, however, because he believes that Billyhas been wasting money. The miners are on strike and money is very scarce. He forces Billy to give up the class. But Mrs. Wilkinson continues to teach him privately, at no monetary cost. She seems to come alive while working with the budding dancer. She pours her emotions into his training, and encourages him to audition for the Royal Ballet School. The two work together rigorously...as rigorously as for boxing, wrestling or football.<br /><br />Billy is also encouraged by his best friend, Michael, who is having difficulties coming to grips with his own puberty - a confusing time for anyone. He is a closet cross dresser and not afraid to wear his sister's school uniform or apply make-up. Michael urges Billy to be himself and to follow his dream.<br /><br />The film's suspense peaks during the day of Billy's audition where multiple things happen at once - both at the dance academy and at the home front - which have a dramatic effect on Billy and his family.<br /><br />Director Stephen Daldry really focuses on the relationship, the strong bonds of love, between father and son. Daldry assembled a wonderful cast, which brings to life the struggles and triumphs of Lee Hall's script. Their speaking accents do take some getting used to, though. But if you're renting or own the DVD, you can always play back the initial scenes until you get used to the speech patterns. The musical/dance montages are magical. Passion and love for dance permeate the film. However, the grim political and economic circumstances surrounding the storyline are ever present. Jamie Bell is phenomenal in the title role. He gives a riveting, sensitive, dynamic performance.<br /><br />I just saw the theatrical production on Broadway and was curious as to how film would measure up. The show was/is extraordinary and the movie does not disappoint.<br />Jana Perskieminers are on strike and money is very scarce. He forces Billy to give up the class.

I have not seen any of the thremal alarms that i read about before purchasing this flash but i can definitely see that it could because this flash is powerful. It works very well even when i am far enough away that i dont think i have a chance of making a good photograph. I highly recommend this flash.
B000001E29|4.0|On first listen, I found this album to be unlistenable.  Insane cacophony. Not the Waits I like. I don't like the Waits songs about cheeseburgers and bourbon and waitresses and I don't like the Waits songs where it sounds like he's stark raving incomprehensibly speaking in tongues.  This sounded like a whole album of the stark raving type.  Then one morning as I was too rushed to change the CD player, I inadvertently gave it another listen.  It was like a whole new album to me - I liked it, and have continued to like it. I don't like challenging \\"listens\\" - execrable music that we are supposed to like to be cool[[ASIN:B000005JA8 Trout Mask Replica]].  This is not one of those album. It's an acquired taste that you may not acquire. It is a collection of songs that sounds like something from some dark, dark cabaret with a little spaghetti[[ASIN:B000E1HVR0 Kraft Noodle Classics, Tangy Italian Spaghetti Dinner, 8-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 24)]] western music thrown in (give Just The Right Bullets a listen). I'd suggest giving the album a second listen.  You might like it.  One of the worst writers/most interesting individuals, William Burroughs makes an appearance on this thing on the song T'ain't No Sin. Pretty nutso[[ASIN:B001E5E1QE The Peanut Shop of Williamsburg Hand Cooked Virginia Peanuts in Large Colonial Style Drum, 40-Ounce Tins (Pack of 2)]].  Hey kids, see what drugs did to Bill. Don't do drugs or you'll look and act like Bill. I assume that Waits got the song or the idea from a song by Fred Hall & His Sugar Babies (1925 I think)[[ASIN:B000005DZD Fred Hall & His Sugar Babies] with the full title 'Taint No Sin (To Take Off Your Skin And Dance Around In Your Bones).

B001FB4W16|5.0|Look I stopped reading romance novels when I was twelve, but I like dramatic TV.  I had almost given up on HBO.  But this is an amazing series.  The best ever female romance fantasy with intense sexual overtones. All the while that is going on, there's a mystery to be solved, with lots of violence and drama for the men.<br /><br />I wondered why I was so mesmerized by this series, and then found out that it was written by a woman, and the woman's point of view, unlike 90% of what you see on film or TV.  Sookie is sought after by powerful and gorgeous men, be they vampires or shapeshifters.  When do you ever see that on TV?  I hope this is a hit and it changes Hollywood for ever more.<br /><br />New sexy vampires have emerged and it's about time for bored women everywhere.  We didn't know what we were missing.  Stephen Moyer could raise any woman from the dead..  My only complaint is that the writers don't give him enough screen time.  Sigh.
B001U0HBPQ|4.0|I saw The Curious Case of Benjamin Button in the theatre about a week after it was released to critical acclaim and talk of Oscar. Expecting a masterpiece, I left the theatre very unsatisfied. I felt I had just watched \\"Forrest Gump 2,\\" sans the entertainment value of that film. I admired The Curious Case for it's scope and beauty, but was very disappointed with the story, especially with the amount of critical acclaim it was getting. I initially thought it was the most overrated film of 2008. When the Criterion Collection released a 2-disc special edition of the film, I reluctantly returned to it to see if I'd missed something.    Based on the short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald and the screenplay for Forrest Gump (the ladder being uncredited of course), The Curious Case opens in a New Orleans hospital where an elderly woman is dying as Hurricane Katrina rolls in. Her adult daughter begins reading aloud from a journal written by a man named Benjamin Button, who was \\"born under unusual circumstances.\\" As the woman's narration fades into a Louisiana-accented Brad Pitt's, we learn of how Thomas Button (Jason Flemyng) discovers his wife dying after giving birth their son. When he sees the child, he panics and drops it on the steps of an elderly-care home managed by Queenie (Taraji P. Henson), who accepts the wrinkled, unhealthy baby as her own not expecting it to live very long. Years later, Benjamin (as he's named) is seven, looks seventy, and is confined to a wheelchair. Living among the elderly, Benjamin meets the granddaughter of one of the care home tenants, Daisy, and falls instantly in love.    As Benjamin brows older (and his body, younger), he longs for adventure and takes a job on a tugboat captained by Captain Mike (Jared Harris). After leaving home, Benjamin quickly racks up plenty of life experiences including an affair with Elizabeth Abbott (Tilda Swinton), the wife of a British Trade Minister. Their brief affair of course leads to a delayed, profound, andpredictable effect on Elizabeth's life.    Of course, we watch as Benjamin goes through almost everything one can go through in their lifetime, but everything leads back to Daisy (played as an adult by Cate Blanchett).    There are sequences that are spellbinding, such as the intentionally aged scene involving Mr. Gateau (an unrecognizable Elias Koteas), the clockmaker and the sequence showing unrelated events creating a sort of domino effect.    The plot is the biggest issue I have with this film. Eric Roth, the Oscar-winning screenwriter of [[ASIN:B00005LC4Z Forrest Gump]], wrote this screenplay. Had another writer penned this script, Roth likely would've sued him for plagiarism. The plot structure, Benjamin's experiences, and Benjamin's and Daisy's relationship are so similar to Forrest Gump, it wouldn't be a stretch to call this film \\"Forrest Gump 2.\\" The essential difference is that Forrest Gump, while having an array of memorable characters, was an event movie; what situation would Forrest find himself in? \\"Benjamin Button\\" is a character movie; what situation will find Benjamin? Guess which film is more entertaining.    The most unoriginal thing Roth did was use a hummingbird as symbolism. The feather (from Forrest Gump) and the hummingbird represent the same thing in both films. Roth's script is possibly what kept this film from a Best Picture statuette.    Script aside, Hollywood doesn't make films like this anymore; 3-hour character studies with no real balls-out action or visual effects that mainstream audiences are accustomed to. However, this film has Oscar-winning visual effects that are truly incredible. Brad Pitt plays the seven-year-old Benjamin Button all the way through his mid-twenties (or sixties, depending on how you look at it) and I was amazed to find that his face was digitally applied to smaller actors. This effect is incredibly impressive and there's not a single flaw. Makeup effects are stunning too. It's fascinating seeing Pitt go froman old man to early-90s Pitt.    The art direction of early 1900s New Orleans is absolutely beautiful; becoming a sort of picturesque, swampy paradise, with the beauty of a painting.    The cinematography is all digital, including the coloration for the scenes that take place long ago. It never looks like it was made to look old, but simply is old. The \\"struck by lightning\\" scenes look like old silent film stock (these are probably the sequences shot on 35mm, mentioned in the accompanying Criterion booklet). The cinematography is masterful and should've won the Oscar.    Not a single actor is miscast in this film. Pitt is an underrated actor doing some terrific work here and Blanchett has a timeless beauty and classic quality that fits any era. Henson more than deserved her Oscar nomination as Benjamin's strong-willed adoptive mother.    David Fincher, who has directed audience favorites [[ASIN:B000050FEN Seven (New Line Platinum Series)]] and [[ASIN:B0007DFJ0G Fight Club]] has directed his most mature effort here. This film is evidence that Fincher will very likely pick up an Academy Award one day for his direction.    The Curious Case of Benjamin Button explores themes of love, time, aging, etc. All were explored to much greater effect in Charlie Kaufman's [[ASIN:B001P3SA8K Synecdoche New York]], a superior film. This film will no doubt appeal more to a mainstream audience as those themes are presented in a much clearer way here.    Upon second viewing, I didn't dislike this film as much as I did before. It's a beautiful, very well-made film that's just not as good as it could've been. It's certainly not one of the best films of 2008, with it's Forrest Gump by way of [[ASIN:B0001GOH6Q Big Fish]] storyline. With it's flaws, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is still a monumental achievement of filmmaking.    GRADE: B-
B001FBSMW6|4.0|I wasn't sure about this album at first since I had read that it was a major divergence from Keane's previous style and sound. At the first listen I wasn't completely in love with the different style. It wasn't until I listened to it a few more times that songs started getting stuck in my head and I wanted to listen to them again. This album is not for everyone especially if you are only willing to accept Keane as they were for their past two albums. My only complaint is that most, if not all, of the songs have an underlying gloom to them.

B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|I thought this movie to be an excellent new breath of fresh air into a franchise that has been hurting since Star Trek IV, The Voyage Home.  The characters are full of energy and the use of Back To The Future techniques to alter the past and create a new timeline has left it open for several sequels without impinging on current Star Trek lore.    A Romulan ship from the future arrives at the time when James T. Kirk is being born.  Immediately they set in motion a new time continium and it is only through a technique used in one of the early Trek episodes (I think the one with Decker) that Kirk is able to be saved.  We then fast forward and see contrasting bad boys Kirk and Spock getting in trouble on their respective planets.  Later we see how the two are both persuaded to enter Starfleet.      During this time Kirk meets up with Uhura (and he tries to get her to give up her first name) and later McCoy and we learn how the nickname Bones comes about.    While at the academy Kirk must defeat the Kobyashi Maru (not sure if I spelled it right) leading to his first meeting with Spock.  The Romulans then attack Vulcan causing the Starfleet cadets to go into action.      I generally liked this movie from start to finish and like the new actors that are playing Chekov, Scotty and Sulu.  I loved the updated Enterprise bridge and the updated transporter effects.  I look forward to the sequels!
0312370849|4.0|Holocaust fiction seems to be a recently-reinvigorated sub-genre, and as such, 'Sarah's Key' requires contextualization against the other players. The book is well-written and evenly-paced such that it can be read with equal amounts enthusiasm and without waning patience. The characters are developed enough to relate to, but still maintain some stock-fiction traits. In summary, though, the story told by de Rosnay is one of striking complexity, depth, and development.<br /><br />In terms of originality, this book really succeeds: the story isn't a familiar one, and it's really quite well done. Without being overly 'preachy' or reliant upon moralistic upbraiding, 'Sarah's Key' manages to still explore and excavate the depth of humane responsibility for one another. Rarely is the impact of the Nazi rule in Germany explored so frankly and honestly within the realm of French history.

B001N26GFM|5.0|This movie will move you to another level when you reach the end.  In 1935 the Nurenburg Laws were past which took away the humanity of all Jews.  They were not considered human therefore making it politically correct eliminating them from the face of the earth. Fast forward to 1973. A law was written by the Supreme Court of the United States stating that the person in the womb is not human therefore can be eliminated at will.  During World War II 12 million humans were disposed of by the Third Reich. Today, 40,000,000 American have been disposed of by the approval of the United States Supreme Court all in the name of Personal Rights. Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it. You will not be the same after viewing this movie.

B0012QE4Q2|3.0|I had read the book ages ago, before \\"Tudormania\\" and so was looking forward to a film of what had been a really compelling book.    This ended up a mere costume drama with some overwrought acting from Portman (who is usually very talented and on-pitch), especially at the end, and not enough screen time for Johannson, who is supposed to be the character referred to in the title of the film.      Bana is surprisingly good at Henry VIII, and Kristen Scott Thomas steals every scene she is in.     The film's pace is so sprightly it is over before we can really appreciate what is happening between the characters, who therefore develop very little, and so we can't come to care about them. In the end, they are just three attractive cardboard cut outs in nice outfits.    But it is entertaining enough to pass an hour and a half or so with, and Scarlett and Bana do well with what they have to work with. Loved the scenery and settings too.
B001PPGAIA|4.0|So truthfully, this movie is pretty terrible. It has ridiculous characters, too much CGI, is too long and over-the-top... but I loved it. I wish I could explain why. There are so many very, very horrid things about it. Someone mentioned Nicole Kidman's screeching at the kangaroos... unbearable. The leads have almost no chemistry, except with themselves. Baz Luhrmann's camera loves Hugh Jackman's body so much I wanted to be a five year-old and ask him to marry it. He doesn't appear to love Nicole Kidman enough to send her the 1000-calorie cookies Tom Cruise used to send her on set so she didn't become an icy stick. Hugh Jackman MUST regain his neck. No one, after dating a person for three years, still calls them \\"Drover,\\" especially when reuniting with them after a near-death experience. Seriously, the man must have a name! What does she call him in bed? And nobody, even Hugh Jackman's watery eyes, can convince me that hearing Nicole Kidman say \\"Crikey\\" is sexy. Oh, and enough with the magic natives, everyone. ENOUGH.    But all that said, I loved it. It was ridiculous and silly and entertaining to the last second. The sight of the DVD makes me crave popcorn like Pavlov's dog. It's unabashedly romantic and sweeping and stupid and fun. The Aboriginal child was amazing, the cattle drive had me on the edge of my couch, and despite myself, I've watched it twice in as many days. So yeah, it's dumb, but I love it. There are times when one longs for something brainy and existential, and times when one just wants to sit back and have one's mind pleasantly anesthetized. This does the trick nicely <drool>.

0792163710|5.0|Alan Ladd portrays Shane, a retired gunslinger who wanders onto the Starrett ranch and befriends the family, eventually working for them. Right from the beginning the character of Shane comes across as a little strange and mysterious, and not much information is given as to his background or past affairs. The cast includes Van Heflin as Joe Starrett, Jean Arthur (in what is to be her final film appearance) plays his wife Marian and Brandon De Wilde as their little boy, Joey. The Starrett family alongside many others are living in the vicinity of a small community with no established law. In other words, trouble flows frequently and the peacemakers of the bunch find themselves and their property threatened by wild and stubborn cowboys, who harbor an intent to drive the settlers out of town.    Meanwhile, a cattleman named Ryker (Emile Meyer) wants to buy the Starrett property, but Joe is adamant in his decision and refuses. Leaving him with no alternative Ryker sends for an infamous gunslinger named Wilson to take care of Starrett, but Shane ultimately intervenes and saves the town from overpowering corruption.    \\"Shane\\" is a movie about conflict; about how one man, a stranger, can put a troubled town back on its feet and, at the same time, change the standing of one family. The showdown between Shane and Wilson, played by Jack Palance, is short, quick and to the point. Palance has such a strong presence as Wilson, yet all it takes is a single bullet. That scene looked and felt like a real showdown. It is a beautiful looking movie with wonderful cinematography, not to mention a story that really gets into your heart. Its classic ending really is what everyone says it is. Very few westerns get any better than this.
B001ER4CNY|4.0|Altogether the collection is nice (although season 1 is colored)    My only deception with this collection is the \\"bottle\\".  I own over 500 DVD's at home and this is THE single most hazardous box to hold a collection of DVD's.    Each DVD is inserted in a sleeve and all these sleeves are glued together in an \\"accordeon\\" type of holder.  I use term \\"glued\\" very loosely:  1 tiny drop of glue at the top of the sleeve and another tiny one at the bottom.     Then you slip this \\"accordeon\\" sideways \\"inside\\" the \\"bottle\\".  If you try to lift the bottle by its \\"neck\\", chances are all your DVD's will slip to the floor faster than Jeannie could blink!...      Even getting a DVD out of this \\"accordeon\\" is hazardous; picture 20 DVD's held in a barely glued cardboard Slinky and you will have a pretty accurate idea!!!    Word from the wise:  forget about keeping the DVD'S it their original holder...  Put your them in a safer box!
B001SO6KNS|5.0|I didn't expect much when I started watching this movie.. but was I in for a surprise.<br /><br />It starts out in the period before Japan invaded China in 1944, and is set up mainly in Ip mans (Donnie Yen) town which had many schools that taught martial arts, basically martial arts was their life, from there on it progresses in a steady pace to the end (I dont want to spoil it).<br /><br />Blu-ray quality is very good, the soundtrack is excellent, the fighting is as real as it gets, and the story is very good, it has many ups and downs which makes it an excellent martial arts-drama-action movie.<br /><br />Highly recommended( I wouldn't pay 60$ though!!)

1582406723|5.0|I picked this book up randomly by instinct.  I finished it the night I bought it, because It was amazing!  Zombie stories usually aren't well done, and my exception is Snyder's Dawn of the Dead.  This book, however, surpasses all of them, and now im begging for more blood.<br /><br />Why is it \\"amazing\\"<br />-Black and White.  The artwork and mood of the black and white is unbeatable.  If they make a film it has to be the same.<br />-Rick.  Awesome protagonist. I could read his dialogue all day.<br />-Plot and Characters.  The story is very original and offers a thought process from an author who extremely cares for the material. You must read the before notes.<br />-Pacing.  At first I was a little thrown-off by the skipped pieces of time, but they really are self-explanatory.  Its more of a collaboration of events, rather than a word for word, second for second story.  Beware, because this could turn you off or turn you on.  For me it made an intriguing difference that I respected.<br /><br />I wanted to start a new series.  I got really lucky that I found this book. It may have mindless zombies on the cover, but the story is generated from the brain of a genius.
B000MCIBE8|1.0|One of the common credentials the Doors often have heaped upon them is that they were the serious, dark, poetic version of their light, fluffy fellow 60's Californian hippie pop acts like the Mamas and the Papas. This is to their credit, but it is an endorsement that still fails to account for, much less exonerate the boys for the fact that they were just another sad facet of the hippie fad.    If we examine some of the Doors most prominent and unfortunately least appealing features, we will find a very bland, monotonous, predictable, and last but not least, pretentious band. The excessive feature of the organ often sounds like an underpaid Church accompanist finally reaching breakdown and leading a mutiny of one against the house of God. Krieger's penchant for small, twangy lead guitar riffs in virtually every Door's song is perhaps a little less annoying but still makes a mockery out of hyperbolic claims Doors enthusiasts often make about their place in history. But all of this pales in comparision to the pseudo-intellectual bleatings of a rock and roll idol whose rocky road to success ended in a French bathtub.    \\"Light My Fire\\" could have potentially been a classic of the 60's era, of which there are many. In spite of its daft lyrics, the really baffoonish way of rhyming things like \\"liar\\" and \\"higher\\", it had the makings of a decent little ditty. The emphasis there is on \\"little\\". Instead, it was expanded, bloated beyond all proportion to its actual merit with Ray Manzarek's obnoxious, sedating organ. This is an excellent example of the quality of the recalcitrant Church accompanist  quality I mentioned earlier that Manzarek's playing exhibits. After what feels like at least a couple of days, but in reality is more like 2 minutes of this tired self indulgence, one gets the feeling that there's only one other organ Manzarek abuses this gratuitously. Unfortunately, the boys aren't finished. They have more excess, more indulgent trash to heap upon this rapidly gathering pile of refuse in the form of Krieger's customary and by now obligatory tiny twangs. God, this guy is awful. Like Manazerk's mischievous meddling of the organ keys, Krieger's turn in the spotlight is all too long and very, very unwelcomed. Finally after approximately 5 minutes of musical noodling, Morrison returns to recite lines that were poor the first time around, again.     Jim and the boys continue to drag their collective knuckles in the mire on the wimpy, moronic \\"Crystal Ship\\". With lyrics that appear to have been scrawled by an acne riddled junior high school student in haste to complete a poetry assignment and music that would not sound out of place on an elevator, this is the kind of song that most people would be personally embarrassed to have written, much less record and release.    \\"Break On Through\\" has familiar organ tinkering from Manzarek. Not just familiar in the sense that it's the kind of rubbish his grubby fingers are always immersed in, but also due to the nagging suspicion one has that this has been done somewhere before in the 1950's and immortalized in a 1980's Pee Wee Herman movie of all places. \\"Tequila!\\", if that helps. Aside from its sad derivative sound, it contains some characteristically pretentious attempts at \\"poetry\\" by Jimbo before he himself proceeds to inflict the most damage on his credibility by shrieking the idiotic line \\"everybody loves my baby!\\" over and over, seemingly ad infinitum.    Perhaps the real tip of the hat should go to \\"The End\\". More pseudo poetry from Morrison. It's clearly an effort to shock and unsettle listeners. It's not only embarrassing drivel masquerading as poetry, but it's not even original in the aspects that are supposed to be the most shocking. The killer, awaking before dawn proceeds to kill his father and make love to his mother. Although maybe the average Doors fan is unaware of this (can they even read?) but this is a concept that is of course directly lifted from Sophocles. It shouldbe noted that Morrison's ambition was to be taken seriously as a poet and not just a rock and roll star, but his \\"poetry\\" was routinely derided and dismissed by critics. Anyone asking why need only listen to the 11 plus minutes of the tedious, pseudo-shockfest of \\"The End\\".    The only good thing about the above track is that it does mark the end of a very pitiful listening experience. Jim Morrison to his credit, went through all of the rapid stages that accompany many of the most exaggerated rock stars in the space of just a few years. He hit his commercial and \\"artistic\\"(sic) peak and was regarded as a sex symbol. Within a few years however, he had become dumpy, bedraggled, and clearly out of ideas. He then died embarrassingly, a sad drug related death of a burned out case. It took Elvis two decades, Morrison did it in about four years. Live fast indeed.    On a footnote, I visited Paris recently and had the chance to see the cemetery in Montmartre where Sartre and Beckett are buried. I did wonder about the whereabouts of Morrison, but he is buried in the Eastern part of the city and we were staying in the North. Suffice to say, neither of us could be bothered to make the trek.

B001EAWMGA|5.0|Great Sci-Fi Movie! I feel that I was very lucky to see it the theater and the critics saw something else. Fantastic blend of Sword and Science Fiction! See and judge this film for yourself. It should have been in wider release and given time for it's audience to find it.

B001LF4IA6|4.0|\\"Maybe we ain't that young anymore.\\"  - Bruce Springsteen, lyrics in \\"Thunder Road.\\"    I was excited to hear that Bruce was releasing another E Street Band album so soon after \\"Magic.\\"  I thought the 2007 album had its moments, but also had some weaker material.  I first heard the entire \\"WOAD\\" album on NPR's free preview weekend.  I have to say that I was blown away on the first listen.  I had already heard the title track, which is as catchy a song as Bruce has had since the single of \\"The Rising.\\"    As others have stated, if you still want redux versions of \\"Darkness,\\" \\"Born to Run,\\" or \\"BITUSA,\\" you will be disappointed.  I don't think Bruce can ever hope to top those records.  Then again, Dylan isn't releasing \\"Blonde on Blonde,\\" the Stones aren't making another \\"Exile on Main Street,\\" etc.  The \\"WOAD\\" record is Bruce Springteen & the E Street Band in 2009 - current and writing about things that affect him as a father, husband, and a man who is approaching his older years after losing two dear friends in the past two years.      Standout songs: Working on a Dream, My Lucky Day, Good Eye, The Wrestler, Tomorrow Never Knows, and Kingdom of Days.      Strong material: Outlaw Pete, Life Itself, This Life, What Love Can Do.    Filler: Surprise, Surprise    Garbage: Queen of the Supermarket    I look at this way: Bruce used to release records every 2-3 years (on average) because he labored over sequencing, lyrics, and what collection made the best album.  Now, he writes and releases what he likes.  He's on a \\"pop music\\" kick with his last two records.  Sure, the lyrics aren't as finely crafted as they were in 1978.  But I think Bruce can see the proverbial clock ticking and he wants to play on the road rather than be stuck in the studio for years.    I am disappointed that Bruce is not playing much of \\"WOAD\\" live this tour.  I'm driving to NJ to see him in less than 2 weeks and I am looking forward to seeing him live.  At age 59, he still puts on a more energetic live show than 99% of his younger competition.  And he blows his contemporaries out of the water from the stage.
B001PA0FFO|5.0|\\"Doubt\\" is an intriguing film that features strong acting performances.  Set in a pre-Vatican II, inner-city Catholic church and school, \\"Doubt\\" creates a tension for the viewer that does not end with the last scene.  In no way is this film predictable.  While it may seem that Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep) is overreacting, the thought of a priest molesting a child already inhabits the Catholic psyche of 1964, the time setting of this film.  That puts it well before the public scandals of the last 25 years.  Any way you cut it, no well-grounded suspicion ought to be dismissed, then or now.  Hence the title and the main theme of \\"Doubt.\\"  Fr. Dennis
B000HWZ61Y|4.0|When I was a teen, \\"Pyromania\\" was one of my favorite albums. Actually, I still think it remains the Leppards' best work. But for four years, I anxiously awaited the release of the follow-up to \\"Pyromania,\\" which ended up being released in August 1987. The delays are well-documented in the liner notes of \\"Hysteria\\" as to what the band was striving for. This reissue discusses how much pressure the band felt in following-up the septuple platinum \\"Pyromania.\\"     In the U.S., there was a great metal radio station called Z-Rock, which played about 3/4 of what was released on \\"Hysteria.\\" So I had heard a good chunk of the album before its official release. \\"Hysteria\\" is as musically different from \\"Pyromania\\" as \\"Pyromania\\" is from \\"High N' Dry.\\" But \\"Hysteria\\" is the kind of record that grows on you with each repeated listen. I really liked the textured guitar layers to \\"Women,\\" the looping beat of \\"Rocket,\\" the raunch of \\"Pour Some Sugar on Me\\" and the great harmonies of the title track and \\"Animal.\\" I like the heavy production of \\"Gods of War\\" and \\"Rocket,\\" which remind me of updated versions of one of my favorite Leppard numbers: \\"Die Hard the Hunter.\\"     Over 20 years after its release, \\"Hysteria\\" is still a very classic album. I was never a fan of \\"Love Bites\\" or \\"Armageddon It,\\" but I like the rest of the material. What is cool about this re-release is that it contains the original liner notes plus some great history about the recording of the record as told by the band.     I also like the idea that the band issued their original B-side singles in this set. I have the old 45\\" of \\"Tear It Down\\" which is far superior to the version that ended up on \\"Adrenalize.\\" I am glad to have a cd quality version of the song. I also really love the live \\"Rock of Ages\\" medley that includes homage to some great songs like \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" and \\"My Generation.\\"     My lone complaint about this set is that I wished it contained a live version of the acoustic \\"Bringin' On the Heartbreak\\" version that the band played during the \\"Hysteria\\" tour. The song began slowly, the crowd sang back the chorus, and it took off. I would rather have had that included than an extended studio version of the \\"Excitable.\\"
B000T97SXY|4.0|It is a nice album, with good songs, following their path of German Power Metal mixed with Judas Priest (during the verses of Sign of Fear and New Religion, if you don't know which band you are listening to, you wonder if the singer is Halford, hence if the band is Judas Priest). They added some modern-metal details - some synthesized guitars on New Religion and the 3rd track, Every Time it Rains, sounds SO MUCH like Evanescence...but still not so much to change their style.    The main thing that I can criticize from this album is that the songs, though powerful and catchy, are a bit simple. They took an overall simple approach to the album, so they jump to the choruses too quickly without developing the songs a bit more. All songs are between 3 and 4 minutes long and they all consist in 2 or 3 different parts and that's it. The guitar work is sometimes pretty flat; a couple of songs don't have a guitar solo at all and some of those that do have solos, are simply 1 or 2 verses long solos with almost no double guitar work, which is one of the things I enjoy the most in metal.     I'd say that this album doesn't measure up with Jaws of Death, Nuclear Fire or Seven Seals or Black Sun but it is definitely better than Devil's Ground, so it is still money very well spent.
B0012QE4Q2|2.0|None of the 3 principal characters had the gravitas to carry off their roles in my opinion.  Especially Eric Bana.  Normally I enjoy Eric Bana, but a Henry the VIII he is not.    The other two girls (Portman, Johanssen) were only fair in their roles.    The thing that really bugged me about this movie was the character of Mary Boleyn.  In reality, she was not the meek, shy, virtuous girl portrayed by Scarlett Johanssen (the type of character she is not good at portraying anyway).  Mary was a ribald character and was not at her sister's Anne's side faithfully thru all.  In truth, the two sisters were not close.    Too bad the film didn't choose to focus on the intense struggles between Rome and England, didn't go more into depth on Anne's fierce Protestant sympathies, and didn't delve into the remarkable personalities of Wolsey, Cromwell and Thomas More.    This was more of a sentimental teenage version of the story (with major distortions) than anything else.
B00127RAJY|5.0|My main reason for purchasing this DVD was because of the good reviews AND the fact that its only 20 minutes.   Let me tell you all something...these 20 minutes will make you wonder why on earth you spent as much time at the gym as you did.   I was in OK shape when I started this DVD, but could definitely afford to lose a few lbs and tone up. Its been a week on level 1 and already I feel a difference in my strength and endurance. These workouts are TOUGH but like Jillian says, if you want results, you have to work for them. My arms look better, my face looks better, my butt is smaller, and I dont get winded after climbing 2 flights of stairs. I am looking forward to starting level 2 this week. I was a little concerned doing the same exercise every day but by the time your body starts getting used to it, its time to go to the next level.   Im not sure whether its my DVD player or not but I think I figured out a way to skip the entire introduction. I just leave the DVD in the player and the next morning hit PLAY and it immediately goes right to the workout screen. Give it a try!    UPDATE! I am on week 2 and have done level 2 for 3 days (with a much needed rest day after the first day) and I am THRILLED with this DVD! I squeeze my arms and I feel MUSCLE not fat! woohoo!

B000002KXO|5.0|Fleetwood Mac's 1982 effort brought them back to the top of the charts after the disappointment with the sales of 1979's Tusk. The break in between Tusk and Mirage allowed the members to pursue other projects. Lindsey Buckingham released a solo album and Stevie Nicks did the same. It was Stevie who had the most success with her solo outing. Mirage seems to pull the group back into top form. The album yielded three hit singles. Christine McVie's \\"Love In Store,\\" Stevie's \\"Gypsy,\\" and Lindsey Buckingham and Christine McVie singing together on \\"Hold Me.\\" This album allowed the band to dive into the MTV generation with the videos for \\"Hold Me\\" and \\"Gypsy.\\" \\"Gypsy\\" is probably one of the bands greatest music videos. They really adapted to the new form and managed to make it their own. Mirage has a very mystical feel about it. It brings us back to the good old days of 1977's Rumours. The album doesn't really contain any duds. Some songs did seem stronger than others. Nicks' \\"Straight Back\\" doesn't seem to measure up to her other contributions. It's also easy to dismiss McVie's \\"Wish You Were Here.\\"     Mirage still comes out as a strong record. It went to #1 on the charts and is my favorite Fleetwood Mac album.
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|This disk does a great job of demonstrating the wide range of Leonard Cohen's catalogue of outstanding songs, beginning with mid-late 1960's.  His voice has darkened over the years, but that only makes songs like Susanne, or the Sisters of Mercy, all the more powerful.  He was clearly enjoying himself during the show, and is truly appreciative of the overwhelmingly warm response by the audience.  He makes an aside about understanding some patrons were being inconvenienced financially and geographically to attend the show (I was willing to spend big bucks and travel thousands of miles to go to the show - couldn't make it happen) and then says \\"we\\" (not I) are honored to play for you tonight.  Leonard may be on the last round-up but he's giving it one hell of a ride.  Rave on, Leonard Cohen.
1439138311|3.0|Colm Toibin, most famous for his Booker Prize shortlist and LA Times Book Prize winning novel The Master, has set his latest novel in both Ireland and New York in the years following World War II.  Eilis is a young, passive Irish woman whose older sister and widowed mother to arrange for her to emigrate to the United States so she'll have a chance at making a decent living away from the crushed, postwar UK economy.  She arrives alone in Brooklyn, with a job and a room secured for her by a priest.  There, on her own and finding love with an unlikely suitor, Eilis begins a transformation into a more independent-minded woman.<br /><br />This novel is a breezy, quick read, and some of the historical details are interesting.  Unfortunately, the substance of this novel is thin, without complex characterization and issues.  Toibin uses a broad brush to portray the New York of the time and often fails to bring the setting alive.  Because of the simple prose and the basic, not-very-compelling plot, it reads as a Nancy Drew novel without the mystery.  I found it difficult to care what happened to Eilis because she never felt real; Toibin seems to have used her as a device for exploring a particular time and setting.  More memorable are Eilis's brothers, particularly Jack, who deserves a novel of his own.<br /><br />This novel will likely disappoint Toibin fans and readers who like denser fiction, but its accessible prose and love-interest plot will be appreciated by some.
031606792X|5.0|So at first i was like omg not another book about vampires in love...but then i started to read it and there was something more to it. it wasn just another bronte novel with a twist there is thrill and spice to it and its wonderful for all ages above i would say 15.It definitely does teach girls that sometimes waiting is ok and not a bad thing.And it gives a whole new meaning to forbidden love. I LOVED THESE BOOKS!!...but i will say this without trying to spoil for others the ending was a little bland...gives way to lead to more and there is NO more.when the movies come out i wonder how they are going to end this saga...the same as the book or with a different kick?:)
B0015OKWL2|3.0|Righteous Kill / B0015OKWL2<br /><br />*Spoilers*<br /><br />I really wanted to like Righteous Kill. I love ambiguous morality dramas like [[ASIN:B0010HOZW6 The Brave One]], and was looking forward to seeing the psychology behind a police vigilante - what motivates him (revenge? justice? protection? disgust? anger?) and whether or not we would agree with his motives, if not his methods. With Pacino and De Niro, I was sure I couldn't be disappointed. In the end, I was both right and wrong. I was disappointed with the movie, but not with the acting. It was the ham-fisted plot that did it for me.<br /><br />The movie starts out, promisingly enough, with De Niro performing a voice-over, video-taped confession - explaining why he murdered his victims, what motivated him, how he chose them. We flash back to 'the beginning' and are treated to the stereotypical long standing cop-partnership: De Niro is the hot-head and Pacino is the mediator, calming him down and keeping him out of trouble. Pacino cleans up De Niro's messes and holds the deep tenderness and understanding that seems to characterize long marriages and cop partnerships.<br /><br />As De Niro explodes repeatedly over various incidents ranging from disputed baseball plays and criminals walking free on court technicalities, the savvy movie goer begins to find themselves on the edge of a doubt. As De Niro sweats under the inquiring gaze of the other police officers and seems constantly on the verge of discovery, it hits us between the eyes that De Niro can't be the killer, because he's just too obvious a set-up. The voice-over confession, the constant raging temper, the internal investigation: all these are so blatant, obvious, and ham-fisted that we realize, long before we are supposed to, that the killer must be Pacino because, well, De Niro is just too obvious.<br /><br />This is irritating. As an avid movie-watcher, I expect twists, sure, but the twist shouldn't be set-up so obvious that it's being shoved in your face. When the entire movie seems to be one long shout of \\"De Niro is the killer!! De Niro is the killer!!\\", then the movie-goer is forced to switch gears from the subtle intricacies of vigilantism and into the teeth-grinding, \\"Well, who is the REAL killer?\\" mode. Let's see, it can't be De Niro because he's too obvious. It can't be his girlfriend because she's there to be a sex object and a victim, and not anything so glamorous as The Killer. (Which is a shame, because it would have been an interesting twist, with Pacino thinking that De Niro is the killer and covering for him, only to find that he had misjudged his partner all this time.) Nope, it's got to be Pacino because he's a headline name and his character is charming and patient, which is an extremely suspicious thing to be in these sorts of movies.<br /><br />After the viewer is slammed in the fact with the \\"twist\\" thirty minutes ahead of schedule, all interest is lost. The movie isn't really about exploring vigilantism, or delving into the psyche of someone who witnesses daily horrors - it's about finding out that Pacino is the real killer. Having already let that slip via the ham-fisted set-up of De Niro, there's nothing much left to do but let it grind down to the end.<br /><br />This movie provides closed captions for the hearing impaired.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardollto be one long shout of \\"De Niro is the killer!!

B001N18HOQ|5.0|If there was an album you should consider a part of the grunge golden years era, certainly you would come up with Nirvana's nevermind, Alice in Chains' Dirt, Soundgarden's Badmotorfinger and....Pearl Jam's TEN.<br /><br />Long ago as I diehard fan I had imagined a new restored deluxe edition for this firestarter album, but I guess the band was worried about touring, editing DVDs, new albums and son on...<br /><br />If music is your drug of choice, then this is the edition you should be getting. It has the original Ten mastered edition, the new Brendan O'brien mixed version, now known as \\"Ten Redux\\" and the outstanding complete Unplugged show they performed for MTV (Meaningless Television) back in 1992, only missing the \\"Rocking in the free world\\" track plus a small improvisation on \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" that I guess were skipped due to copyright and stuff like that.<br /><br />Musically speaking you get some awesome demos from the \\"Ten\\" era, tracks like \\"Brother\\" yes!! the sang version!!! \\"A Breath and a Scream\\" (early version, not the singles soundtrack well known edit) \\"State of Love and Trust\\" (another early demo with slowed down tempo) \\"Just a Girl\\" (the same you've already heard on many bootlegs but this time, truly remastered) \\"Evil Little Goat\\" (a rehearsal demo already available in a few bootlegs, weird they decided to put it since it's an incomplete recording) and the \\"2.000 Mile Blues\\" (the only track I would consider as a rare track)<br /><br />Now for what's to come of the blockbuster album, you get the original album mix (for diehard fans I guess) and as I said earlier the \\"Redux\\" edition which is awesome, 'cause it turns the 90's sounding album into a more modern rocking album of course with a lot of respect for the classic quality of each track ,so you won't find some sort of techno trance crappy version of \\"Even Flow\\" haha!<br /><br />For the collectors it comes with a booklet full of drawings, paintings, old pictures and some original writting for several lyrics.<br /><br />Sooooo, if you don't want to spend extra money on cool items (tape, vynils, book, pictures, stickers, polaroids, etc) this is the deal for you, because you're getting the most important part of this re-release which is in fact the music and Pearl Jam's music stands for its own damn right!n't want to spend extra money on cool items (tape, vynils, book, pictures, stickers, polaroids, etc) this is the deal for you, because you're getting the most important part of this re-release which is in fact the music and Pearl Jam's music stands for its own damn right!
B000R8YC1I|4.0|Dark Crystal / B000R8YC1I<br /><br />Having missed out on the majority of the 1980's fantasy flicks, for various reasons, I've been backfilling my knowledge in this area, with mixed results. I definitely enjoyed [[ASIN:B0000VD12I Conan]] and [[ASIN:B0001Z37HM Red Sonja]] was fun, but I wasn't sure what to expect from a \\"kid's movie\\" (as it was described to me) like Dark Crystal.<br /><br />Dark Crystal is, in my opinion, a surprisingly good film, even watched 'for the first time' nearly thirty years after its debut. The plot is easy enough for a child to follow, but engaging enough to maintain an adult's interest. The idea that extreme good and extreme evil are two sides of the same coin is not a new one, but it is fascinating to explore the implications here.<br /><br />The characters are vibrant and imaginative; I was thoroughly sucked in by the quiet and kind Mystics, the bickering and vicious Skeksis, and the plucky and hopeful Gelflings. The puppet-work here is truly superb and really makes the viewer reminiscent for the old days - they just don't do puppet work like this anymore. (And though I love CGI-Yoda battles as much as the next person, there's just something more `real' about the puppets, somehow.) Most appreciated of all, I was pleased and delighted to see that the heroine is - in many ways - even more capable and just as crucial to the fulfillment of the prophecy as our sweet Gelfling hero is. It is very nice to see a role for women in a fantasy movie that extends beyond \\"needs rescuing\\" or \\"looks great in a chainmail bikini\\".<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good fantasy film. There is some scary material here - such as the crystal that removes the \\"life essence\\" of the captives - but everything is put right in the end. I actually enjoyed Dark Crystal more than the more recent [[ASIN:B001LPWGBO City of Ember]], and for a movie that is past its twenty-fifth anniversary mark, that's saying something.<br /><br />This movie provides captions for the hearing impaired.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll>This movie provides captions for the hearing impaired.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll

B00004STUL|4.0|An impossible heist of millions of dollars of heroin, stored in the Miami Police Departments evidence room, has just become possible by a man named Fouchet and his group of thieves. After the heroin has been stolen, Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) and Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) are put on the case to get the stolen heroin back. The only lead they have though is a woman, Julie (Tea Leoni) that was shot at and who also watched her friend get gunned down by the same guys who stole the heroin. Thanks to Marcus and Mike's `shoot first and ask questions later' tactics, they are about to be yanked off the case and Fouchet will get away with the heroin and the murder of Julie's friend.<br /><br />Back in 1995, I would've rated this movie at a 10 on a scale of 5. I was also 16. This movie is perfect for the way I used to be. Women, fast cars, money, and all the action a man could ask for. Yes...hormones were in charge of anything and everything I thought about. Now that I'm older (you do the math), I've calmed down a lot more. Yes I still love those same things I was talking about, but now instead of one lower brain thinking, I now have two. Usually the top one has more say-so in what I do now, depending on the amount of alcohol in me. So after seeing this movie for maybe my 10th or 20th time, I would have to say this... I still love it. Michael Bay knows action. Yes it can be extremely over the top, but I don't care. It's an action movie, and I'm here for some crazy stunts. And it delivers. Probably my favorite scene would be the bathroom scene where Marcus is getting a beat down, but delivering it back also. And oh the slow-mo that Bay is known for is littered in here. Sometimes it's great, like when the good guys are coming out of an elevator and they see the bad guys. That was nice. Then you got scenes where it's definitely not needed. For instance, during the heroine heist, they slow-mo a pad lock being cut. Yep. The movie has a lot of action, but it also has a lot of comedy in it as well. The comedic duo of Smith and Lawrence is perfect. Which is good, because I'm not a fan of Martine Lawrence. But in this movie (as well as the sequel), he actually cracks me up. Joe Pantoliano plays Captain Howard and I must say his character is a riot. But aren't they all usually in buddy cop movies? Always screaming and saying some wise crack.  I will say though the funny starts to get a little repetitious towards the end and a little tiresome.<br /><br />Bad Boys is probably one of my favorite Michael Bay films. If you hate the guy though, you'll probably dislike this also. It's full of action, guns, cars, adrenaline pumping music, and some hot women, and a story full of holes. What's not to like?<br /><br />P.S. - I remember thinking Tea Leoni was the hottest chick in the world when this first came out... lol. Not so much anymore though.medy in it as well.

So having a recording of the show has double the significance for me. A very fine recording and excellent performance by this timeless performer who seems to really enjoy the experience and takes his audience with him. Highly recomended.
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|For 43 years I have carried the torch for Star Trek. When I was 15, I helped get signatures for petitions to keep Star Trek on TV; I taped the shows on reel-to-reel, transcribed them and sent both to my friend in Europe (just before the third season,her father had been transferred overseas by the Air Force); in college, I made sure to secure the dorm TV for Star Trek; when the first movie came to my city, I was among the first group to see it; I raised 5 children who each know Star Trek well and who have now seen everything filmed and have read much of what has been written, also.  Now we have all seen the new Star Trek universe; we love it.  It isn't \\"my\\" Star Trek.  But, it doesn't have to be....       I am at peace; I can rest.  This new Star Trek universe is in good hands.    I laughed, I cried, I remembered.........it was just perfect.  I would live it all over again, if I could.   You young people can.......
055380684X|5.0|In recent years, there have been several books and even more articles written in response to research conducted by Anders Ericsson in these subject areas: the structure and acquisition of expert performance, experts' ability to expand working memory and access to long-term memory with training, and use of Protocol analysis as a rigorous methodology for eliciting verbal reports of thought sequences as a valid source of data on thinking. These books include Geoff Colvin's Talent Is Overrated: What Really Separates World-Class Performers from Everybody Else and Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers: The Story of Success. In The Talent Code, Daniel Coyle gratefully acknowledges the importance of Ericsson's research, agreeing with Colvin and Gladwell that greatness isn't born; rather, it is developed by a combination of luck (i.e. being \\"given\\" opportunities); ignition (i.e. self-motivation activated by one or more \\"primal cues\\"), what Coyle calls \\"deep practice\\" (i.e. 10, 000 hours of focused and disciplined repetition, requiring an energetic and passionate commitment), and master coaching provided by \\"talent whisperers\\" who  \\"possess vast, deep frameworks of knowledge, which they apply to the steady, incremental work of growing skill circuits, which they ultimately don't control.\\"<br /><br />At one point in his narrative (Page 72), Coyle declares, \\"We are myelin beings.\\" OK, but so what? When tapping into a neurological mechanism in which certain patterns of targeted practice builds skills, we create entry to \\"a zone of accelerated learning that, while it can't quite be bottled, can be accessed by those who know how. In short, they're cracked the talent code.\\" What about myelin? According to Dr. George Bartzokis, professor of neurology at U.C.L.A., it is \\"the key to talking, reading, learning skills, being human.\\" It is a neural insulator that, Coyle claims, some neurologists now consider to be \\"the holy grail\\" of skill acquisition because every human skill \\"is created by chains of nerve fibers carrying a tiny electrical impulse - basically a signal traveling through a circuit. Myelin's vital role is to wrap those nerve fibers the same way that rubber insulation wraps a copper wire, making the signal stronger and faster by preventing the electrical impulses from leaking out. When we fire our circuits in the right way - when we practice swinging that bat or playing that note - our myelin responds by wrapping layers around that neural circuit, each new layer adding a bit more skill and speed. The thicker the myelin gets, the better it insulates, and the faster and more accurate our movements and thoughts become.\\" Better yet, \\"we are all born with the opportunity to become, as Mr. Myelin [viewed as broadband] likes to put it, lords of our own Internet. The trick is to figure out how to do that.\\"<br /><br />As Coyle's uncommonly detailed \\"Notes on Sources\\" on Pages 223-232 indicate, he consulted the results of dozens of different surveys. Moreover, he seems to have read almost all available books and articles in which those who conducted the research share their insights. It should be noted that he also traveled extensively, conducted dozens of interviews, and engaged in hundreds of on-site conversations, thereby supplementing others' research data with his own first-hand observations. For example, he visited inner-city schools involved in the Knowledge Is Power Program (aka KIPP) and spoke at length with the program's co-founders, Mike Feinberg and Dave Levin. When the program was launched, most of the students ranked far below average and only 53% of them passed the state English and math tests.  At the end of the first year, 90% of them passed.<br /><br />Coyle provides a rigorous and thorough analysis of KIPP in Chapter 7. Here is a brief excerpt: \\"One way to look at KIPP is as a unique tale of goodhearted underdogs who caught lightning in a bottle. If that were all it was, our interest in the story would end now. The other way to look atit, however, is an example of pure ignition: the art and science of creating a talent hotbed [in each school, in each class, and in each student's mind] from the ground up, without the assistance of a World Series homer or another magical breakthrough. That's why it's useful to look under this remarkable jalopy to see what makes it go.\\" No gimmicks and no shortcuts. Currently, there are 66 KIPP public schools in 19 states and the District of Columbia enrolling more than 16,000 students. Across the KIPP network, 65 of the existing 66 schools are charter schools. The majority of KIPP schools (more than 85 percent) are middle schools designed to serve fifth through eighth grade students. The remaining schools include seven high schools, six pre-kindergarten/elementary schools, and one pre-kindergarten through eighth grade school.<br /><br />As Coyle suggests, \\"it's time to rewrite the maxim that practice makes perfect. The truth is, practice makes myelin, and myelin makes perfect. And myerlin operates by a few fundamental principles\\" that explain where extraordinary talent  (defined as \\"the possession of repeatable skills that don't depend on physical size\\") comes from and how it can be developed. Although it is possible to \\"overlay research such as Ericsson's with the new myelin science to formulate a universal theory of skill\\" (i.e. deep practice X 10,000 hours = world-class skill), it is important to keep in mind that \\"the truth is more complicated than that.\\" I am grateful to Daniel Coyle for providing such an entertaining as well as informative book, one that has increased substantially my understanding of how to \\"grow\\" talent. His is a brilliant achievement.example of pure ignition: the art and science of creating a talent hotbed [in each school, in each class, and in each student's mind] from the ground up, without the assistance of a World Series homer or another magical breakthrough.

0575076917|3.0|I have just completed reading this book in a marathon session. One of the main things that kept me going was wondering: Is this going to get any better? To which the answer was: not really.    While taken on its own, this book is ok. When compared to the rest of AR's work, this fails to impress. I love and own all of AR's stuff, due to first reading Revelation Space. If this was my first AR book, I do not think I would have gotten hooked on him. This seems like the kind of book that was either ghost-written or forced by the publishing company.    Way too much uninteresting dialogue, way too little exciting hard-science talk that I love AR for.    For the dedicated AR fan, I warn not to expect too much and maybe to just think of it as more opera/drama than space, but still read it. For anyone else, start with 'Pushing Ice', which I have come to love outside the RS universe.    Would buy as a gift for only hard-core Reynolds fans.
B001AVEJ1Y|4.0|This is not your father's Star Trek.  The odd thing is . . . I am now the father.<br /><br />I saw Star Trek this afternoon, and I was entertained. It's a solid flick, exciting, moving, and funny. But as I walked out of the theater, I sensed something was amiss. Something akin perhaps to the awkwardness a 44 year old man feels when he gets an IM from a woman half his age. Sure, the \\"girl\\" ends up just being some bot, but for a fraction of a second, the woman is real, and the contact is just wrong.<br /><br />In addition, having watched all the classic Trek television episodes, movies, and countless spin-off series, I didn't fully appreciate the new movie basically wiping out ALL of those events by establishing its own time line. Imagine someone taking an eraser to over 40 years of a story's mythology. And Paramount Studios allowed the new Star Trek writers to do this all in the name of making the franchise \\"hip\\" again so that they could score big cash from a new generation.<br /><br />Ah, let them. It's not my Star Trek anymore. I am just going to think of this afternoon as a bad dream and watch a few old episodes of the series on DVD.

0307266303|5.0|If, when you finish with this book, you don't immediately get yourself outside and run like hell, then there's probably not a drop of living blood in you.  This book is the perfect antidote to everything that's wrong with modern running and the way to find everything that's still so right with it.  Even if it were all a work of fiction McDougall's tale would still be worth the price of admission.  Fabulous.
0156030209|3.0|I don't have much to say but this book never really grabbed me.  It started slow, was mildly amusing with Pi's religious dabbling, became much more interesting after the shipwreck and then lost me during the last 80, increasingly fantastic pages.  That this book is allegorical, working on different levels with reference to religion, nature of man, nature of beast, etc... is certain but it never inspired me to bother thinking twice about it.      I will say it seems the author did his research on religion and animals, all the information presented seems reasonable (except the plot) and at times his style his admirable.
0439023483|5.0|I have to admit that, prior to reading \\"The Hunger Games,\\" I had my doubts - not because I didn't think it sounded like a good book or story, but because I wasn't sure if I would be able to handle a book where 24 contestants (that you grow attached to) are forced to fight to the death on live TV. The premise definitely intrigued me, particularly because I think it's a very interesting take on future society (and could in fact be possible), but I just wasn't sure I had the stomach for it. However, although there were no doubt moments that made me cry (which was quite embarrassing considering I was on the plane sitting next to someone while reading it), Suzanne Collins did such a good job with the story and character development that you love it regardless. The deaths are handled very well - they are described in detail yet not overly gratuitous - and there are so many twists and turns that you are literally incapable of putting the book down (or if you do you'll be left thinking about it all day long).        I initially only planned on reading a couple pages on the plane ride from Montreal to Atlanta, and then taking a nap for the remainder of the flight (as I was exhausted and had hardly slept a wink the night before). However, after just 5 pages into the book, I was completely hooked and there was no getting me to shut it. I highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone. The ending does leave you wanting to know more, but that just makes you anticipate more strongly the sequel. I can't wait for the next book to come out!
B000024D4R|5.0|Animals is another Pink Floyd masterpiece. Stylistically and lyrically it is clearly a Roger Waters opus. However, I suspect that without David Gilmour's contributions the LP would have been just as interesting but not nearly as listenable or enjoyable. I do miss the spacey psychedelic sounds of the band's previous output going back to 1967. On the other hand ten years had passed since Piper and one cannot really quibble if the band decided to explore new territory. I don't quite understand why Animals is not considered by the majority of fans to be the equal of the two records that preceded it and the one that followed. For me each of the records is unique and brilliant. How often in Rock Music history has one artist or band managed the feat of creating four supreme efforts on the trot? The Beatles (Rubber Soul through to White - five records), Springsteen (his first four or six or seven), Stones (Banquet through Exile - five including the very fine live Ya-Yas), Dylan (1963-1969) and Van Morrison (Astral through Saint Dominic) are a few that come to mind.
B001IBIQU6|5.0|About 5,000 years ago, a very wise Man sat atop a mountain peak and said \\"You cannot please all the people all the time\\". Here we are 5,000 years later, and his ancient words of wisdom are just as relevant in todays Modern World. From the looks of it, this album will go down in history as the most debated DM \\"album\\" of all times, but theres nothing WRONG with that.    What I will say though, is that this CD is one of their most complete, most vibrant, most listenable to efforts to date. This could arguably be there best album ever, but theres no way i'm gonna touch that one, especially not right now.  On this CD, DM creates a genre of music all their own. This music should be labeled \\"Symphonica\\", because of the intricate ways by which DM  layers their always creative and lush synthesized oscillations. \\"Electronica\\" is an understatement, and doesn't even come close as a description.    If you want to buy a CD that you can put in your player, then press \\"play\\", this CD is for you. If you are a DM fan from day one, this CD is for you. If you want to buy a CD where you will have to hit the \\"skip\\" button every other song, then this CD is not for you.    To all you folks out there dicing this CD to shreds, all I can say is BE FOR REAL. Yeah, there are hints of \\"Black Celebration\\", and \\"Ultra\\", as well as \\"Construction Time Again\\", but you will find the same thing in albums of all Musical Artists who have been around for more than 2 or 3 albums. DM is deep into their 3rd decade of imaginative music folks. THIRD DECADE!!!    Add this CD to the Cart, and proceed to CheckOut.

0618680004|4.0|When I began this very readable book, I jumped to the conclusion that it was a politically-inspired reaction to the years of the Bush presidency. But it really is an orthodox tract. Religious fundamentalism and extremism are not the primary targets, for Dawkins opines that even religious moderates plow fertile ground for extremism. So naturally it all must go - no half-measures here.    Dawkins has no empathy or affinity for the spiritual experience. In one of many preemptive moves which doggedly ensure that this discourse remains a harangue, he in effect declares that it is rubbish anyway. This strikes me as analogous to someone writing a book critical of contemporary art who has no feel for it - and then justifying their criticism by saying it is all worthless anyhow.    Dawkins is certainly a devout Darwinist. He takes evolution where it was never designed to go: Cosmology, \\"consciousness-raising\\", and his pet theory of memes. Sometimes I got the feeling that where others might automatically say God did it, Dawkins automatically says evolution did it. Then there are the familiar statistical probability arguments based on exactly one known instance - the known universe. Statistics weren't designed to go there, either.    In the years since its publication, observations can be made about the effect of the book itself. I find that it has had the effect of promoting a certain conceit in many of its readers. There exists a perception that atheism is a sign of superior intelligence. But I've observed that this is no high plateau of intellectual discovery. In fact, an assertive atheism is often accompanied by a trend of callow, inflexible or generally uninformed thinking.      Which reminds me of Michael Shermer, whom Dawkins references quite frequently. In his book \\"Why People Believe Weird Things\\" there is a chapter entitled \\"The Unlikeliest Cult: Ayn Rand, Objectivism, and the Cult of Personality\\". Compare the comments from richarddawkins.net to those from any numberof Ayn Rand sites, and see if you don't detect a certain similarity.     And again speaking of Shermer, I quote from the above (and I believe this is not out of context):    \\"The phenomenon provides a lesson about what happens when a truth becomes more important than the search for truth, when the final results of inquiry become more important than the process of inquiry, when reason leads to so absolute a certainty about one's beliefs that anyone who is not for them is anathematized as against them, and when supposedly intellectual inquiry becomes the basis of a personality cult\\".    The last chapter of the book, \\"The Mother of All Burkas\\", is the finest in my opinion. Here Dawkins describes how science extends our ability to discover beyond our evolved senses. A whole book of this would accomplish much more than \\"The God Delusion\\" does. But I'm guessing Dawkins feels he has written that already.     The above may seem like a negative review, but I'm giving it 4 stars because it is overall well-written and undeniably thought-provoking.
031606792X|5.0|So much negativity about this book, but I'm an older reader and I loved this book.  We got the much awaited wedding, honeymoon, a child, and Edward and Bella finally being able to surrender to each other.  As for Bella getting off easy, I always felt she was destined to be a vampire, written in the stars so to speak, and the fact Edward couldn't read her mind fit with the outcome of the whole story.  I for one think this movie on film will be beautiful and well anticipated.  So this reader loved the book and the rest of the series.

B001K3JF7K|1.0|It is hard to imagine a more boring and lifeless album than this one! Okay, I can \\"imagine\\" Norah Jones's three albums, so Mrs. Elvis Costello does have some real competition in the realm of 'boring singer-songwriters'.<br /><br />To be fair, Ms Krall is a vastly more accomplished performer than Norah \\"Snorer\\" Jones, AND she's made some reasonably good albums in the past.... and, believe it or not, I've occasionally enjoyed hearing them. However, this new album simply has had all the life and passion sucked out of it. What happened? One too many Mogadons before the recording session?<br /><br />The songs are sung with a lilting and listless voice and it rarely rises about a whisper most of the time. One can detect that Diana Krall isn't actually a bad performer, it is just that it becomes quickly and overwhelmingly apparent very quickly when one is listening to this album that Ms Krall is entirely apathetic about and disinterested in the material she is singing. She seriously sounds like she is half asleep much of the time! I am not joking!<br /><br />Why couldn't she sing something with a bit of fire? Even slow and pensive songs can be delivered with some passion and fire, albeit, subtle fire and restrained passion! We hear none of that here.<br /><br />Please, Diana, on your next album, drag your hubby into the studio and take some of his advice. Try to sound angry or passionate, or at least engaged with the music for a change! Maybe sing \\"Watching the detectives\\" or \\"Oliver's Army\\"! Elvis wrote some pretty cool songs in his length and vibrant career!
B00008G9JN|5.0|Jethro Tull \\"Songs from the Wood\\" is one of my all time favorite albums.    It is a great mix of true rock liberally stirred into ancient Celtic folk music.  The classic guitar and rock and roll flute mix beautifully with dulcimers, mandolins and a host of other instruments.  The lyrics are interesting and entertaining as well.  What's not to like?      I can listen over and over and never get tired of it.

No movie is perfect, and this movie obviously does have flaws but as a whole it's one well presented package.

If not you can watch this movie and learn a little bit about the how the rest of the world is living their day to day lives.

3822837849|5.0|As expected, Taschen Publishing has done a wonderful job of filling in some of the many information gaps in the history of photography. Any serious collector of photography has heard of the most famous of the early American Photography Journals--\\"Camera Work\\" named after the photographers who were at that time usually referred to as \\"camera workers.\\"<br /> This nearly three pound, 552 page beautifully printed collection of photographs is a \\"must have\\" book for the true collector or student of photography, but I'm afraid much of the general public will look at the images and wonder what the big deal was with this almost legendary photography magazine. I've often heard \\"Camera Work\\" referred to but this is the first time I was able to see all the photographs that were included in the 50 issues and one special issue that were published over a 14 year period from 1903 to 1917.<br />By the time Stieglitz decided to cease publication, the magazine had morphed into more of an art journal featuring modern art with some issues not including any photographs. Never the less \\"Camera Work\\" made a very important contribution to the development of American Photography. While this book doesn't include any of the journal's articles or essays or reproductions of the artwork that filled it's last editions, it did introduce the world to American photographers of the \\"Pictorialist School\\" and the work of the \\"Photo-Secessionist Movement.\\" It helped promote photography as an independent art form. However, the \\"Pictorialist School\\" of photography was so limited and stylized that during the fourteen years he edited, published and financed \\"Camera Work\\" even Stieglitz became bored with the style while he moved into Modernism. His personal collection of his photographer friend's work included many original prints by one of his chief competitors of the era, F. Holland Day, and after a fire in Day's Boston Studio, Stieglitz had the only prints of some of Day's best work. \\"In 1933, he gave his collection of over 600 photographs by members of the Photo-Secessionists and other pictorial photographers to the Metropolitan Museum of New York. By this time he had come to see little value in this style of photography, a style he had almost single-handedly nurtured in America, and now wanted to be rid of it.\\"<br /> The book includes an excellent introductory essay by Pam Roberts about Alfred Stieglitz and his two photography journals. His earlier magazine was \\"Camera Notes.\\" The book contains 559 beautifully reproduced copies of Photogravure, Half tones and even a few of the earliest examples of Tricolor photographic images. Master photographer \\"Walker Evans could only remember one Paul Strand image from the 559 reproductions. Ansel Adams and Eliot Porter recalled Strand, Stieglitz and Steichen, but the mass of pictorial work seemed to them from another era, as indeed it was.\\"<br /> The book contains many \\"firsts\\" or near-firsts in photography history. There are lots of nudes, my favorites by far, powerful pictures of the Industrial Revolution, early action and sports subjects, and lots of portraits of groups and individuals. Some famous personages are shown, but there are also lots of average people who helped people like Clarence H. White by getting up before dawn in order to pose for him at exactly the moment the light and weather was perfect for White's desired image. They also had to devote time to making costumes and rehearsing the desired poses before the day of the actual shoot. I didn't care for all of the reproductions, but I could at least appreciate why they were there. Since art is in the eye of the beholder, there will be pleasing images for any viewer contained in this one-volume encyclopedia of early American photography. One of the few questions I had after reading the book was if this book is a smaller sized version of the original journal. The book is 7.7 inches by 5.6 inches, but that does not seem to be the same format ratio as the photographs of a couple of the actual publications pictured across from the book's table of contents. That's not enough to make me not appreciate the contribution Taschen has made to photography by republishing all the original pictures included in the pioneering work at a really inexpensive price.couple of the actual publications pictured across from the book's table of contents.

B00005JNNZ|5.0|The storyline has been done to death: determined coach comes to rescue the kids. This time it is a largely minority basketball team and Ken Carter, who played for Richmond High thirty years ago, comes to turn the kids into students, athletes and a team in that order.<br /><br />  Lots of basketball, lots of insights into the kids and their lives. Gritty, gritty, gritty. The script is above average as are most of the performances.<br /><br />  But there is never any doubt that this movie is a star vehicle for Samuel L. Jackson. He is the movie. He overpowers everything and everyone around him. I am sure that real movie critics have a set of words for this kind of bravura performance.<br /><br />  Jackson is simply great and he carries the movie on his shoulders, rendering Ken Carter as a truly fine man, someone who cares about the kids entrusted to his harsh discipline and clear goals.<br /><br />  If you want to be inspired, if you want to feel that there is hope out there, see this movie: Samuel L. Jackson's Ken Carter will convince you that there is a chance things will come out okay.<br /><br />Jerry
B001TOD92C|5.0|Since I do not follow either professional wrestling or the career of Mickey Rourke, this film should have had two strikes against it from the beginning. But just like Randy, The Ram, the wrestler attempting to make a comeback, the film wins on all levels. I am certainly glad I saw it and recommend it highly. Rourke was nominated for an Oscar for best actor and won a Golden Globe for his performance.<br /><br />The story line is simple and straight-forward. Down and out, poor, the user of too many drugs, a failure at relationships, Randy only knows one thing: wrestling. After a heart attack, when he attempts to retire and works in a deli, forced to put that mane of hair under plastic, slicing cheese and dipping up tuna salads, his is a life that is a living hell.<br /><br />Realizing that he has \\"f---ed up\\" his relationship with his daughter Stephanie (Evan Rchel Wood) Randy attempts a reconciliation that he f--ks up too. \\"I don't want to be alone.\\" Even though we are fairly certain how the film will end, we root for Randy along the way as he attempts to make something out of his life. Both the scenes between him and his daughter and Pam, the stipper (Marisa Atomei) will tear your heart out. Rourke in a word becomes Randy, the Ram.<br /><br />The film touches what is deepest in all of us: the need to love and be loved, the fear of being alone, the bitter realization of lost opportunities.<br /><br />The gritty cinematography is perfect and just what is needed for this starkest of movies.
B001TOD92C|1.0|This film depicts Lowlife USA at its worst: coarse humor, gratuitous violence, tawdry sex, hard drinking and drugs.  It unfolds in a mind-(and soul-)numbing succession of raw scenes, lacking depth and emotional force.  Mickey Rourke has too much in common with Randy the \\"Ram\\" to achieve dramatic transcendence.  He comes across as coarse and pathetic; his melodramatic performance, filled with self-pity, made me cringe, especially as the film wore on. I wanted to like this movie but it just bored and sickened me, leading nowhere but deeper into its own vacuous hell.

MAN ! What a great surprise THIS was !!! May be the BEST surround mix I have,plus the live concert footage, and CD as a 2nd disc, with 3 bonus tracks, and book !?!?  Yeah, THIS is the way to go !!!
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|Prior to watching this concert I guess the Three Tenors was the best DVD concert I had seen but Leonard Cohen surpasses each of the great tenors.  The concert is much more intimate a feature of the great camera work.  You get a real appreciation of Leonard Cohen the poet, the songwriter and the performer.  Simply a sensational view.
B001U0HBPG|4.0|Although throughout you feel the movie stripped heavy inspiration, pathos, and motiffs from Forest Gump, the movie is detailed and well crafted.  Surprisinly, for 165 minute length, I didn't feel the movie dragged, but instead was decidedly conscientious of not over explaining and thereby propeling the narrative forward.  There are some logical gaps, but the characters are engaging and have a certain amount of charm.  Benjamin's inheritance was an easy excuse to fund his vagabond lifestyle, and the Paris accident was another fairly indelicate deus ex machina. Conversely, the overly-elder Benjamin special effects were shockingly excellent and whimsical.  A solid, but not classic release  that does have its meditative moments.
B001TH16DS|5.0|I bought season 1 several days ago and was extremely impressed with what  they have done. I won't go into all the technical stuff because others have already done so. I saw the new release of star trek at the theater  and have to say that I enjoyed season 1 on blu-ray more than the new and  so called improved version with all the special effects and CGI. The   special effects are so over the top that they take away from the confusing  story line and plot. Season 1 with its slightly enhanced effects is just  what the doctor ordered for us true die hard star trek fans. As you well  know the original Kirk, Spock and crew (Shatner,Nimoy and others)are irreplacable. I can't wait for the release of season 2 and 3.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I thought my wife was silly for wanting to buy a silly exercise DVD by Jillian, the hyped-up \\"Biggest Loser\\" trainer.  I respect Jillian and have watched her on the previous seasons train the contestants.  I thought this was just another way to make money on the marketing of the TV show.    I was mistaken.  I just completed my first workout with my wife (she challenged me to give it a shot) and it completely drained me.  For a guy that can run 7-miles without a problem and lift weights in the gym for 90 minutes twice a week... that is saying a LOT!
B0027GGL6W|2.0|I'm a Stone's fan.  And i've heard that Muddy Waters had a profound impact on their origination and style, even to this day.  Drugs, alcohol and money continue to destroy regardless of race, religion or goal.  One has  to admire a hard working young man going from picking crops in the field to making music.  However, paranoia  and  the desire for more is so destructive.  This reminded me of the recent \\"Walk the Line\\" movie.  And for years i've heard about the struggles of Chuck Berry.  I'd love to see a sequel that goes from this era of R&B and shows Phil Spector's \\"Wall of Sound\\" generation.  So many of the musicians and singers are still around, and this would tie together a wonderful story of a beginning, a middle and maybe a 3rd movie that takes us to Jimmy Buffett, Greatful Dead as well as breakups of groups such as the Beatles, Beach Boys and others.  Each generation needed something and got it, but at what price to the consumer and the artist.  someone always wants to be bigger, better, richer.  In the end it is destruction, death, hostility and hate, with some great music along the path.

B00000F214|5.0|This movie is one of the great movies of the 90's.  It kicked off Kevin Spacey's career.  Benicio Del Toro is in it.  Just an all star cast of guys who weren't that popular then.  The story is awesome and after all these years the plot twist is still great to watch.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|I was introduced to the music of Leonard Cohen in 1967 and my life has been graced by his amazing music ever since. Through ups, downs and moments of pure wonder, I've been soothed, comforted, held in place and<br />uplifted by his insight and vision. I was privileged to obtain seats at his May 5th concert in Chicago. What a delight to hear his voice still rings clear, rich and strong as a Harley Davidson at idle. His supporting group is jaw-dropping stunning - they must have been assembled in the tower of song. I haven't heard a (mouth) harp player as good as Dino Soldo since Paul Butterfield. The Barcelona guitar master is Javier Mas and Bob Metzger on lead guitar is outstanding. Neil Larsen (keyboard), Rafael Bernardo Gayel (drums)and Roscoe Beck (bass, vocals and musical director) are perfect.  The Webb Sisters and Sharon Robinson must be on leave from the Angelic Choir and I'm sure some heavenly acrobatic choir misses their flips and harmony.<br /><br />There was a great article in the New York Times by Larry Rother at<br />[...]%20Cohen&st=cse&scp=2&pagewanted=print .<br /><br />If you can see him live, sell the Dylan LPs, cash in what's left of your 401K, get a cup and beg on the street. It truly was worth it - the best concert I've ever seen.<br /><br />I bought the DVD at the concert ($20 there -was a good deal I thought- but really it's cheaper here! As is the CD.) Later I bought the CD on I-Tunes and it does a great job of capturing the magic of the concert, Goosebumps and all.<br /><br />Without reservation I recommend this. In this age of uncertainty as the foundations we're standing seem to be eroding, the clouds roll in and the weatherman is panicked looking for a weather vane -- go with the music. As Cohen says...\\"...there is a crack in everything..That's how the light gets in...\\"

0143038419|1.0|Ostensibly about things spiritual, Eat, Pray, Love is IMO about nothing except its author. Narcissistic in the extreme and exceedingly repetitive (OK, we get it, you're depressed already), this memoir might better have been called \\"A Year in the Life of Elizabeth Gilbert\\". The author is to be applauded for taking a break from the life that apparently was destroying her soul, but there's not enough here of interest to others to warrant an entire book, unless you happen to care about Gilbert's every thought. Because I chose to stop reading it after the section on Italy, I'll stop writing about it here. Enough said.
B001SKB1Y0|2.0|I have never written a review... but this movie really made it mandatory to do so... I was surprised at how bad this movie was... I read the reviews and thought I would still give it a chance- after all it had good actors and although the reviews spoke of their bad performances, I thought they were maybe just dull- instead I actually found watching the movie made me feel just awkward and uncomfortable - all the actors except penelope were very jolty and did not fit with in the setting... Originally, I didn't even get what the reviews meant by this, because it is really hard to imagine just how awkward and terrible it is until you watch it for yourself...   I gave this two stars just because at the end of the movie I understood what the plot had tried to accomplish, but I really almost didn't make it past the first 10 minutes-   In the end it was really a waste of time... Do not watch the movie.. not only is the plot dull but I have not seen this awkward of acting since seeing a movie in a bin of free unknown movies from the early 90s

B000WGWQG8|5.0|John Adams was one of the Founding Fathers, the greatness of whom was appreciated at the time, although more so after his death as historians examined his life with the benefit of historical perspective.  This miniseries is based upon David McCulloch's acclaimed biography of John Adams, and it is a faithful, and even loving, recreation of the story of John Adams' remarkable life.<br /><br />The miniseries takes us from the time of the Boston Massacre to the American Revolution, to the founding of America and through its early years as a fledgling nation.  Mr. Adams was there for almost all of it.  Adams was defense counsel for the British redcoats who were tried for, and aquitted of, murder for their actions in the Boston Massacre.  He then was a firebrand delegate to the Continental Congress as an outspoken advocate for American independence, a radical idea at the time.  This film explores all of this and provides insight into Mr. Adams' ideals, and his well-known outspokeness and stubborness.  It also explores his relationship and partnership with his wife Abigail, who history records was his full political partner and confidant throughout his career.<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed the film's treatment of Adams' relationship with Thomas Jefferson.  Friends, then bitter political adversaries who later reconciled their friendship.  I might have enjoyed an even more thorough exploration of this dynamic.  The interaction between Benjamin Franklin and John Adams is similarly fascinating, and is one of the high points of the miniseries.<br /><br />The film's review of Adams' single term as America's second president was very interesting, and it is consistent with McCulloch's (and modern historians') analysis of the Adams administration.  Adams' great accomplishment as president was keeping America neutral in the war between Britain and France and in avoiding war with France.<br /><br />No review would be complete without commenting on the theme music for this miniseries.  It is vibrant and inspiring.  Some films benefit immensely from a stirring musical score and this is one of them.<br /><br />This is not a perfect film.  Like many a miniseries, it might have benefited from a bit more editing.  Adams' family problems (he had them, just like almost all families do) probably could have been handled with more brevity with no sacrifice of clarity.  Likewise the various medical issues upon which the film dwells.  In its defense, one must say that this piece reminds the viewer that our forefathers lived in a tough and dangerous time, when a serious illness meant death much more often than is the case today.  Any study of the lives of the people of that era cannot but notice the significant role that disease and illness played.<br /><br />The American Revolution and its ideals are vital knowledge that our schools do a poor job of providing to our young people.

B001DEVZUG|4.0|I had most of the songs on this album before, so I bought it mainly for the DVD with the music videos and the few songs that I was missing- I am not disappointed. If you are just starting on your Annie Lennox, I suggest purchasing Bare and Diva instead.

0739308742|3.0|The last book in a series of four by R.R. Martin.  The series is very good, however takes attentive listening.
B001AVEJ1Y|4.0|I have only this to say:    Much has already been written about the new movie, and if there is any grousing, it is usually about \\"too much action, not enough social commentary.\\"  Old-school fans seem to feel that, in this regard, the filmmakers have really swung wide from Gene's vision of the future.    I would submit that the utopian themes are hiding in this film just as they are in all the other TV episodes and movies--things are just moving so fast it is kind of difficult to sit back and think about them.    For instance, what is the #1 area of conflict in the world, and has been, arguably, for at least the last 10 to 20 years?  The Middle East.  Radical elements of that region have declared war on Western Society--no matter your political leanings as to why or how we fix it, that's just a fact.  But who was LEADING the USS Kelvin into battle in the opening scenes of \\"Star Trek\\"?  A Middle Eastern Man.  That gets lost in the hype over the sacrifice Kirk's father makes in the same scene.    Also, there are two examples of inter-species dating in the movie.  Kirk and Uhura's roomate, and SPOILER: Spock and Uhura herself.    Little things like this pepper the film.  So I don't think Star Trek has lost it's Utopian side.  But like the child of hippie parents, it (unlike them) doesn't wear its politics on its sleeve.

014241011X|5.0|Every year I read this book to my fourth grade students and it is always a big hit.  I admit that Roald Dahl's themes and sense of humor are edgy, but that's what makes his books so enjoyable to children.  While a lot of children's books are written in a syrupy-sweet, sterilized style, Witches has a taboo, cigar-smoking grandma with a missing thumb who tells her grandson that the only way he can stay safe from witches is to never take a bath.  It's refreshing.  And, as with most of Dahl's books, the main character is a bright, tough, lovable kid who children can enjoy rooting for.      Also, I've noticed that almost every one-star review is by a Pagan who thinks she owns the word \\"witch\\" and is offended that the author decided to use the word to describe a creature that is entirely different from herself.  Lighten up, ladies.  I don't think Roald Dahl was talking about you when he wrote this book.
B000TGCR38|4.0|I have to say at the outset that I am generally a cinema snob who carefully checks out what the professional critics (Time Magazine, SF Chronicle, NY Times) have to say about a film before I view it. \\"Black Book\\" presented itself on my low-budget DISH TV movie package when I was channel-surfing. So, no chance to vet this one. Not much familiarity with Paul Verhoeven's work, either. And how lucky for me that was. I watched, totally without preconceptions, what I found to be an exciting, mostly believable, totally well-filmed and well-edited, and brilliantly cast and acted movie. \\"Night and Fog\\" it was not, of course, nor was it intended to be, And, yes, there was that crotch-dying shot (which struck me as a signature European detail as much as a Verhoevian one), and, yes, the plot advanced at action-movie speed and sometimes strained viewer credulity and even comprehension (a newspaper review characterized the plot as \\"convoluted\\" rather than \\"complex,\\" and I find some truth to that).     However, the reviewers who dismissed--often in tones of utmost sarcasm--\\"Black Book's\\"  obsession with action and nudity, and decried Verhoeven's decision to portray the Nazis in something other than the usual simplistic black and white terms, missed, I am persuaded, this director's fairly honest attempt to incorporate people, events, and situations from his own childhood observations and later research, into a compelling, multi-faceted, and moving story. In obsessing over a few scenes of nudity, the sometimes excessive pace of the film, and the shape-shifting of its characters, these reviewers have missed precisely what gives this movie its greatest value (besides, of course, the incredible acting of Carice van Houten). History books tell us that in World War II Europe, noble behavior was too often a victim of raw human need, and of simple human weakness under the incredible duress of war. War is not ennobling, and suffering by no means always builds character, whatever our eldersmay have told us.  Normal people can be--as in ordinary times--venal, or heroic, or both at once. After all, many people nobly helped Anne Frank and her family avoid Nazi discovery for two years, but at least one of those people basely reported them to the authorities.     This movie gets my vote, and apparently that of many Amazon reviewers. Anyone who still is unsure about seeing it might be further persuaded to do so by reading an interview by Salon.com with Paul Verhoeven himself, in which he discusses the genesis of \\"Black Book\\" at some length.
B00140PK6O|5.0|I absolutely loved this wonderful movie. The acting is superb, the storyline entertaining, and the period costumes and sets are very authentic.

B0017R5UAA|5.0|Looking at some of the more negative reviews, it seems that a bit criticism of Fleet Foxes is a lack of originality. I think that the point is correct, to an extent, but don't let it deter you from getting the record. If you're looking for an experimental band, Lightning Bolt, the Boredoms, or even Animal Collective are where there's a lot of great innovation in pop. However, Fleet Foxes aren't trying to experiment with the boundaries of what listeners will put up with, let alone enjoy. No, this record is recorded to be beautiful, not new. In that respect, it succeeds.   The best way I can think to describe the sound of the music is to say that it's the kind of album I'd listen to on a warm autumn night where the leaves aren't quite falling from the trees. Lyrically, it's vastly superior to other breakout bands from 2008. Vampire Weekend, which was the band of the month it seems from January '08 until God knows when has no depth to their lyrics. This criticism cannot be leveled at Fleet Foxes in the same manner. Given, a song like the opening \\"Sun it Rises\\" or the popular \\"White Winter Hymnal\\" aren't exactly brilliant. However, if you look to tracks like \\"Tiger Mountain Peasant Song\\" or \\"Oliver James,\\" you'll find beautiful, if chilling lyrics, with the specter of mortality running through them.
0316017922|3.0|I read this book in less than 2 days. It was an easy and enjoyable read. But there were several problems that kept me from giving it four or five stars.<br /><br />The author's point is that innate talent or genetics are not sufficient to explain successful outliers, whether in music, sports, business, etcetera. He states that there are other factors, some of which we might designate as \\"luck\\", that are often downplayed but are critical for high-level achievement or success. There's nothing new or revolutionary about his thesis. In fact, I would even state that it is obvious, although he provides some very interesting and entertaining examples to make his point.<br /><br />However, his research was almost all from secondary or tertiary sources. He rarely considers opposing points of view and significantly downplays innate ability (perhaps to help sell his book and comfort the average reader that he/she is not completely to blame for his/her underachievement). He also reaches conclusions that are based on conjecture, rather than compelling, independent research. For example, he states that Asians excel in math because math makes more sense in the Asian languages than in Western dialects, and their rice paddy culture instilled a strong work ethic that was not conveyed in traditional Western feudal societies. While this is interesting and may have an element of truth to it, there are some problems with this view. First, why do 3rd and 4th generation Asian Americans excel in math despite an inability to read, write, or speak in their original Asian language? If hard work is the answer (i.e. innate ability is not the reason), then why has research shown that Caucasians do better than Asians on verbal tests, whether tested in the native Asian tongue or in English? Does hard work only pay-off for math? He also cites a psychologist that claims Asians have a higher IQ than Caucasians, but then he cites another psychologist, J Flynn, who says that the Asian IQ has been historically lower than Caucasians. He seems to cite Flynn to bolster his position that intelligence is not the reason why Asians are excelling in academics, yet he never considers the possibility that perhaps the IQ testing method and questions may be flawed, which is why there are conflicting results from two prominent researchers.<br /><br />Gladwell also mentions Ericsson's work showing that it takes 10,000 hrs of deliberate practice to achieve high-level success or become an expert in a given field. But he inadequately defines deliberate practice. It does not mean practice, in the generic sense. Ericsson had a very specific meaning when he used that term in his work.<br /><br />Overall, I would say that this book is entertaining and an easy, enjoyable read. However, it should not be read as a well-researched text or reference. It is a great introduction into the field of expertise and success research, but nothing more. For this reason, I've given the book 3-stars.ically lower than Caucasians.

B00004SA88|5.0|This is the best of Niccolo Paganini, performed by the best concert violinist (Salvatore Accardo) to ever tackle the composer's intracate nuances, and backed up by one of the best orchestra's (the London Philharmonic) conducted by someone I never heard of (sorry Chuck).    It's a 6 CD set, so stop choking on the price tag; it's well worth the money.  My favorite CD is the first; it only took me a month to get the rest, because I kept play the first CD over, and over, and over...

044024367X|4.0|This Reacher tale is as engaging as the others, with the villains plausibly updated to match the Bush Era.  There is some borrowing from an earlier Reacher outing, Die Trying, as well as from Dashiell Hammett's classic, Red Harvest, but all to satisfying effect.  The plot has perhaps one thread too many, but Reacher gets to regularly mete out punishment to those who need it, in the usual hypercompetent fashion.  Let's face it, Reacher was always pretty much against the Man anyway, and anyone who couldn't figure out what our hero would say about the last eight years of U.S. government just hasn't been paying attention.  Looking forward to Gone Tomorrow!
B001W2I9Y4|5.0|Im not the biggest Mastodon fan but I have liked them since Leviathan. When I heard their version of Metallica's Orion on the Kerrang comp CD, i was extremely impressed, and i started to like them even more.  I always felt that musically, they we're really good, odd time signatures, not your run of the mill lyrics, they just have some very cool music. The vocals always left me feeling kind of \\"eh\\", and the guitar sound was a little gritty, not that its bad but you had to be in the mood for it. Crack The Skye is step in the right direction of the overall sound, vocals, etc. There is not one song on the album i dont find myself wanting to listen to again. Im sure some fan's will like their older sounding stuff, but for me this is a much better album than blood mountain. It's good to see a band moving forward, rather than putting out the same record over and over.
B001JJBO74|5.0|The descriptions of perfumes in this book are AMAZING. I actually started highlighting and post-it marking different scents and have been on a mission to track them down and smell!!! There are several brief chapters in the beginning about the science of smell, the types of fragrances and the history of perfumes. And then! wonderful descriptions of perfume, some quite amusing. Jicky, Cuir de Russie, Apres l'Ondee, Lolita Lempicka, Mitsouko...names I've read over the years, but magazine reviews and scent flaps really are pitifully inadequate after reading this book. This book is probably not for the person who is content to wear the latest Britney Spears scent but for someone who is a lot more adventurous. I would recommend also \\"The Emperor of Scent - A True Story of Perfume and Obsession\\" about scientist Luca Turin and \\"The Perfect Scent - A Year Inside the Perfume Industry\\" a great story about how a perfume is actually created, both by Chandler Burr (no, I do not know him). It would have been a very nice touch to see photos/illustrations of  the perfume bottles, but still, a great book.  Enjoy!
0739432141|4.0|A fun fast paced read.  Hard-boiled hero in a future where a person's consciousness can be stored in a advanced data chip called a \\"stack\\" and \\"sleeved\\" into different bodies. Morgan writes a good noir detective story and deftly handles the implications on society of his stack technology. Rated R for sex and violence. His hero is a ex-super special forces soldier who is downloaded into a body to solve a crime for a very rich client.  His rich client is hundreds of years old because he has the money to keep a steady supple of new bodies for his use.  When one wears out, he moves on to the next one.  In this world you live as long as you can afford to live.
1423101472|5.0|If you've read The Demigod Files, then you know how this one begins. If not, let me just remind you that we're all set for the war that may just end the world, between the gods and the Titans. Percy and the rest of his friends from Camp Half-Blood are on the side of the gods, but as Percy has learned, too many of his friends and even minor gods have gone over to the side of the Titans. Kronos is causing some major trouble and the gods are very busy, trying to defeat him.<br /><br />Oh, and remember that prophecy? The one in the first book, that we didn't really get to hear all of? This time, we get to hear the whole thing, and let's just say, it's not encouraging. You can tell from the beginning that this is going to be a real battle, and there are no guarantees.<br /><br />All of my favorite characters are back in this one: Grover, Tyson, Annabeth, Nico, Chiron, Mrs. O'Leary, the centaurs, the pegasi, and of course, Percy. Rachel is here too, and Percy is getting a strange vibe from her. But Riordan doesn't spare his characters - this is war, and there are some heartbreaking casualties. No details, but it was intense in some parts.<br /><br />One of the fun things is that Riordan introduces a new god or immortal in every book, and this one is no exception. Many of the characters are new this time around. And even some of the previous characters reveal themselves as being a lot more complex than we might have expected.<br /><br />It was not a perfect book, really, but I love this series so much that I'm not going to nitpick. There was love, hate, death, war, humor, and nonstop action. What else could I want in this conclusion?
B001AVEJ1Y|4.0|*******Likely to contain spoilers*********<br /><br />I grew up as a Next Generation watcher, but I'm fairly versed in back episodes of Star Trek, have seen all the movies and have a mother who's a HUGE fan.<br /><br />As a movie, this installment of Star Trek was highly enjoyable.  Liked the plot, liked the acting, liked the action, liked it all.<br /><br />But when it comes to the believability of the story in the context of the overall franchise, well this movie basically wiped out EVERYTHING that's taken place for these characters over the last 40 years.<br /><br />After the movie my mother kept saying, \\"Now they need to go back in time and change it all back.\\"<br /><br />Uh, I doubt that will happen because this gives the Star Trek franchise a clean story board slate with a cast of fresh young actors to work with.<br /><br />I'm sure purists are at best lukewarm to this.<br /><br />However, I think about Superman or Batman or Terminator or even Star Wars...these franchises have been all over the time line with the stories they present about their heroes.  Batman even has TWO installments with the joker, I mean how do you choose between Nicholson and Ledger?  It could just be a generational difference.<br /><br />In the end, I don't think the Star Trek franchise shot itself in the foot by making this move, I don't think it was lazy, and I don't think it will drive hardcore fans away.<br /><br />It will however bring in a ton of new fans, open the door for NEW story lines for the young crew (come on, we've all wondered 'what if' it'd gone down another way) and energize the franchise for years to come.<br /><br />If nothing else, it will keep the purists gossiping for a good long time.
B00006V9A0|3.0|In truth, I give the band Nirvana five stars, as it is one of the most influential rock bands of the 90's. This is just one of the few bands back in the days that brought massive popularity to Alternative Rock. However, I have to give this CD three stars, just because there's more to Nirvana than just their hit singles. Of course, everyone's got to listen to the previously unreleased single \\"You Know You're Right.\\" But then again, everyone's got to listen to almost all of the songs that Nirvana has released. Bleach, Nevermind, Insecticide, In Utero, and MTV Unplugged in New York are just right. I know times are tough right now, but if you're absolutely willing to go for it, go for all five albums that I've just mentioned instead of this compilation album that's featured on the top of this page. There's more than just \\"The Man Who Sold the World,\\" \\"Heart Shaped Box,\\" and \\"In Bloom\\". There's also \\"Polly,\\" \\"Scentless Apprentice,\\" \\"Something in the Way,\\" etc.
B00005K9LM|1.0|This may be the second worst Priest album after Ram it Down. Rocka Rolla can be excused because the band hadn't found its sound yet, Turbo and Point of Entry are excuseable because the band (and the fans) looked at both albums as experients. There's no such redemption here, this album is every bit as bad as Ram it Down. Granted, then first two tracks (Freewheel Burning and Jawbreaker) are awesome songs, the rest are all completely forgettable. Even look at the stupid song titles (Love Bites, Heavy Duty, Turn On Your Light). Love Bites is a mind-numbingly awful track with stupid lyrics about Vampires (Vampires are awesome but not here). Heavy Duty and the title track both stink, in fact both are the two worst priest songs ever. Some Heads are Gonna Roll has a good solo but that's it. Eat Me Alive has a good intro, and then goes downhill from there.<br /><br />And another thing, the lyrics are TERRIBLE. Yeah Painkiller had stupid lyrics too but it could get away with it because the music was so damned awesome. There's no such redemption for that too, the lyrucs are stupid. With dumb lyrics like \\"We're gonna rock you till your metal hunger's fed\\", \\"Let's all join forces- rule with an iron hand- and prove to all the world- Metal rules the land\\" as well as \\"With animal lust they'll devour your life- and slice your word to bits like a knife\\". This is especially shocking since Halford wrote the lyrics. Wasn't Halford supposed to be the \\"Metal God\\" or something? As for the production is terrible too- the guitars sound like keyboards, the drums sound like Holland is banging on a plastic cup, and the bass is too loud. THere are noticeable volume drops on the album too.<br /><br />How this trash got the reputation of \\"Best Priest Album\\" is beyond me. Cut your teeth on \\"Killing Machine\\" or \\"Sad Wings of Destiny\\" or even \\"Painkiller\\" instead, if you must.
B00005R2M3|5.0|Excellent seller.  Fast, efficient and excellent product.  Will buy from this seller again.
B001IARDJ2|2.0|I read this book because even though the movie got bad reviews I figured if they made a movie from a book at least the book was good.  I was wrong!  Boring, stupid, unrealistic ending.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|I am in love with \\"British R&B\\". I love this album. Adele is infectious with her soulful, sultry voice. Before Adele, Amy Winehouse, and Corrine Bailey Rae, I was in a musical box, wouldn't even consider listening to anything but R&B from artist I already know and love. I never dreamed that music abroad would touch my heart in such a profound way. I could listen to First Love, Right as Rain, Tired, Chasing Pavements, and MELT MY HEART TO STONE, over and over again. I await more Blue Eyed Soul.
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|Now firstly, I was not a Trekkie before seeing this last night at the cinema in Digital projection. However though, the trailer looked amazing, and I remember watching the show on TV on the Space Network every morning before going to school. I also remember dressing up as Data from The Next Generation on TV.<br /><br />Anyways, last night I saw this in a packed cinema with every single seat taken. We had gotten tickets in advance, and got to the theater early. Good thing we did- the lineup was longer than the great wall of China! We were lucky to get good seats too. And boy, we LOVED this movie!<br /><br />Anybody would like this movie, even people who don't like Star Trek. Hell, Even my sister who didn't like the show loved the movie. There were even a lot of non-Trekkies in our theatre, if I had to guess.<br /><br />This movie is a reboot of the franchise, taking us back to the very beginning. We learn the origins of the characters Spock and James Tiberius Kirk, Kirk's bumbling misadventures at the Starfleet Academy, Spock and Kirk's rivalry, the Klingon, and much more.<br /><br />The movie is flat out perfection in every sense of the word. The special effects are excellent, the visuals are breathtaking. Sometimes there are Camera flares (meaning light relecting off the camera), adding to the \\"beautifully shot\\" feel of the movie. The action is top notch- The handheld camera adds to the intensity of the scenes (don't worry, the camera doesn't shake all over the place, you can actually see what's going on). There's tons of humor too- Kirk is HILARIOUS, as well as there are tons of hilarious moments in this movie, including Kirk getting all the injections- now that was hilarious!<br /><br />The best thing about the film is the casting- Chris Pine is awesome as Kirk, and is really funny here. I was surprised to find out he played Darwin Tremor in Smokin' Aces too- he was hilarious in that one as well. Karl Urban as McCoy, John Cho as Hikaru Sulu, and the sexy Zoe Saldanha as Uhura is awesome too. Anton Yelchin as Chekov and Simon Pegg as Scotty were hilarious too, Pegg was the PERFECT Scotty. Truly fit the quirkiness of the character.<br /><br />But the real high point of the performances is Zachary Quinto as Spock. He plays Spock perfectly. The look, the tone of voice... he really IS Spock. He makes a lot of Spockish facial expressions throughout too, he's really Nimoy-esque. Speaking of Leonard Nimoy, he's in the movie too! It was a great surprise to see the original Spock.<br /><br />So in short, do NOT miss this while it's in the cinema. Abrams has really nailed it here. Well, I'm now a fan of Star Trek thanks to this movie! People applauded at the cinema when the movie was over. I was one of those people, in fact I even yelled \\"YEAH!\\".chin as Chekov and Simon Pegg as Scotty were hilarious too, Pegg was the PERFECT Scotty. Truly fit the quirkiness of the character.

1416511946|5.0|I was captivated by The Heroin Diaries: A Year in the Life of a Shattered Rock Star by Motley Crue's Nikki Sixx. I didn't think I'd like it. I didn't want to read a dissertation about what happens when you do heroin, and then hypocritically get preached to by the guilty party about \\"staying off drugs.\\" But that's not what The Heroin Diaries is at all.<br /><br />The Heroin Diaries is indeed a diary...Nikki Sixx's real diary with very brief, dated entries from late December 1986 through Christmas Day 1987. But you get much more than the just the diary entries. In between almost every entry is a little snippet from select people that were involved in Nikki's life back in 1987. However, the snippets are all written recently for the sole purposes of the book, and snippet writers include Slash, Vanity, Nikki's friends, family, band management, and of course Mick, Vince, Tommy and a lot of Nikki himself.<br /><br />The fun part of the book are the side stories of the absolute mayhem and debauchery that took place during the final recording days of [[ASIN:B001EN1R3G Girls, Girls, Girls]] through Motley's 1987 tour. The  not so fun part is reading about what was really going on in the head of the leader one of the coolest rock bands ever.<br /><br />Any Crue fan will thoroughly enjoy this book. It will certainly leave you wanting more...more of the good stuff anyway. The good stuff being all of the fun stories that we didn't get in this Diary that took place in Motley Crue from [[ASIN:B001EN1R2M Too Fast for Love]] through [[ASIN:B001EN1R3Q Dr. Feelgood]].

0307341569|5.0|Although this is certainly not for everyone - it's a very dark novel, it is the best book I've read in ages. Very clever and well written, like Sharp Objects was.  I read it in a single 9 hour stretch, quite literally, I just couldn't put it down.

0385339100|4.0|If you need to escape your present day life, but don't have access to $90 million to fund your new lifestyle, take a seat in your favorite chair and lose yourself in this enjoyable read. I love the fact that the protagonist thought of \\"everything\\". I also love the reference to the fact that most criminals make 25 mistakes. Patrick Lanigan made one fatal mistake. Buy why? Was it love that clouded his thinking? Something else? Were there 24 other (less obvious) mistakes?<br /><br />It would also be interesting to know if Mr. Grisham would write this book after 9/11. Irregardless, it brings to our attention once again that the lines are not always clearly drawn between good guys and bad guys. Grisham has reminded us of that for over 20 years. Grisham also lets the reader decide - is Patrick Lanigan a good guy or bad guy?
B0018CWEYY|5.0|I've been watching Lost on DVD and have to say I can't imagine doing it on TV. It's SO much easier following all the plot twists when I don't have to have the narrative interrupted by commercials and episodes separated by a week.    I highly recommend it.
0790734850|5.0|------------------------<br />Brett Chase: Excuse me, ma'am; just the facts.<br />==================================<br /><br />L.A. Confidential is based on the novel by James Ellroy. Known for his short, staccato prose style--called telegraphic--like the tap, tap, tapping of a telegram sent in Morse code, Ellroy wrote 4 books set in Los Angeles; all sharing similar time frames and some of the same characters. Beginning with 1987's The Black Dahlia, the series is called The Los Angeles Quartet (not to be confused with Felix Slatkin's Los Angeles String Quartet).<br /><br />Screenwriter Brian Helgeland and Director/screenwriter Curtis Hanson loved the material and had a vision for how it would translate to a great film. With the right attention to period detail, the right soundtrack, and the right feel for the film noir style, they would really have something. The soundtrack, with songs by Johnny Mercer, George and Ira Gershwin, Jerome Kern, Sammy Cahn, Harry Warren, Richard Rodgers, Lorenz Hart, Cole Porter, and Harold Arlen; sung by Bing Crosby, Dean Martin, Kay Starr, Betty Hutton, and Lee Wiley; or performed by Chet Baker and Gerry Mulligan showed their exquisite taste. How could they go wrong?<br /><br />Casting Russell Crowe as sensitive brute detective Bud White sealed the deal. He would later win an Oscar for The Gladiator, but here is where Crowe first showed his huge potential to be at once tough and tender. His cop was hard and brutal, but he had a soft spot when it came to females in peril:<br /><br />---------------<br />[Dick Stensland arrives with liquor for a party]<br />Officer: What took you, Stensland?<br />Dick Stensland: My partner stopped to help a damsel in distress. He's got his priorities all screwed up.<br />========================<br /><br />Russell! Put the phone down! Step away from the phone, Mr. Crowe!<br /><br />I count three flavors of corruption here:<br />1.) L.A. Police Dept.<br />2.) Los Angeles<br />3.) Hollywood<br /><br />There is corruption within the L.A.P.D. One scene, based on a real event, has them going on a drunken rampage and beating Latino prisoners on Christmas Eve. Besides racism, there is also a goon squad that attacks mobsters from out of town who try to establish the mob in L.A. Mickey Cohen is a prime example. Though they are stamping out crime, could it be that they are just trying to eliminate competition for their own criminal enterprises? Ask Captain Dudley Smith (James Cromwell) about that.<br /><br />The City of Los Angeles is also infected with corruption, with land development deals and zoning decided in ways that favor men such as Pierce Patchett (David Straithairn). Not only does Pierce have a stake in such things, he also runs drugs and has a brothel of prostitutes who resemble movie stars. To get his way on the land deals he gets dirt on politicians and D.A. Ellis Loew (Ron Rifkin).<br /><br />Helping Patchett gather and spread the dirt is Sid Hudgens (Danny DeVito). Hudgens has found a gold mine in the scandals and scrapes of Movie Stars in Tinsel town, and the public's endless appetite for salacious gossip. DeVito might have been the weakest choice in casting, just because he is a little bit too familiar (what is Louie DePalma doing away from the Taxi dispatch?), but he kind of grows on you--like a fungous.<br /><br />---------------------<br />Sid Hudgens: He's on a night train to the big adios.<br />=============================<br /><br />It is interesting how the three kinds of corruption are all intertwined and intermingled:<br /><br />----------------------------------<br />Captain Dudley Smith: [interrogation at the Victory Motel] Reciprocity, Mr. Hudgens, is the key to every relationship.<br />=============================================<br /><br />At the time this movie was made the OJ Trial was all the rage, and therefore the theme of how scandal and tabloid journalism was such a huge industry, casting a distorting rather than revealing spotlighton truth and justice, really resonated. Prescient it was, too. It came out just before the Monica Lewinsky/Bill Clinton affair almost brought down a President. The magazine that Hudgens ran was called Hush-Hush, but it was based on the real life magazine Confidential, perhaps the precursor to all the TMZs, Matt Drudges, and Perez Hiltons of today.<br /><br />Seemingly at odds with Bud White and the rest of the L.A.P.D. is Detective Ed Exley (Guy Pearce). He goes against the grain, doing everything by the book, but rubbing the cops the wrong way. Though his father was a legend in the L.A.P.D., his son is barely tolerated; yet he is such a skillful player of police politics that he rises through the ranks. He is held in scorn for wearing glasses, yet proves to be a tough cop after all. Guy Pearce does a good job with the role, in spite of the fact that he is British and had previously distinguished himself by playing a drag queen in an Australian film, The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert. With Russell Crowe being from New Zealand, you had two non-Americans in the lead roles, playing L.A. cops. Not for an instant did I doubt either one:<br /><br />-----------------------<br />Bud White: The Nite Owl case made you. Do you want to tear all that down?<br />Ed Exley: With a wrecking ball... You want to help me swing it?<br />=======================================<br /><br />Sgt. Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) also stood out at the intersection of Hollywood and Vice. His claim to fame was that he worked as a technical advisor for Badge of Honor, a show based on Jack Webb's Dragnet. Brett Chase is Badge of Honor's Webb:<br /><br />----------------------<br />Jack Vincennes: I'm the technical advisor. I teach Brett Chase how to walk and talk like a cop.<br />Jack's Dancing Partner: Brett Chase doesn't walk and talk like you.<br />Jack Vincennes: Well, that's 'cause he's the television version. America isn't ready for the real me.<br />==========================<br /><br />Vincennes also works hand-in-hand with Sid Hudgens--at least until his glimmer of remorse moment. He takes pity on actor Matt Reynolds (Simon Baker) who is being used to blackmail D.A. Ellis Loew (by the way, Simon Baker is now the title character in the hit show The Mentalist; and Ron Rifkin, who plays the D.A., is on Television program Brothers and Sisters). Yes, Sgt. Vincennes finally tries to do the right thing. Too bad no good deed goes unpunished:<br /><br />--------------------------------<br />Captain Dudley Smith: Have you a valediction, boyo?<br />Jack Vincennes: [gasping out a name] ... Rollo Tamasi.<br />===============================================<br /><br />What? Rollo Tamasi? Like \\"Rosebud\\" in Citizen Kane, you'll just have to watch L.A. Confidential to see what significance Rollo Tamasi holds.<br /><br />Last but not least, Kim Basinger as Veronica Lake Look-alike hooker Lynn Bracken was great. Besides looking like Lake she also had great chemistry with Russell Crowe... and Guy Pearce... and the City Councilman (Jim Metzler)... and... Curtis Hanson would later use Basinger to play Eminem's mom in 8 Mile.<br /><br />--------------------------------------<br />Lynn Bracken: You're the first man in five years who didn't tell me I look like Veronica Lake inside of a minute.<br />Bud White: You look better than Veronica Lake.<br />===================================================<br /><br />So, the bottom line is that L.A. Confidential was great in every way a film can be great. My only qualm is that there was no Frank Sinatra on the soundtrack, though Frankie does make an appearance in the archival footage.<br /><br />--------------------<br />Dick Stensland: You're like Santa Claus with that list, Bud, except everyone on it's been naughty.<br />=================================<br /><br />SELECTED FILMOGRAPHIES:<br /><br />KIM BASINGER<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00005JLQE 8 Mile (Widescreen Edition)]] (2002) ....

B00065MDSG|5.0|Just from the title you can tell this is going to be a little different from your average Rock & Roll excursion. And different it is. Is this even Rock? Well whatever it is, I like it. This is probably my favorite KC album, although \\"In the Court\\" and \\"Starless and Bible Black\\" are barking at its heels. I don't think words can convey the sound of this album so you'll just have to listen to it, but be forewarned, it is not for everybody. If you tend to like the Top 40 stuff off the radio you may want to take a pass on this one. If you tend to be a bit more adventurous might I suggest a darkened room, an easy chair, and the volume cranked rather high. Herbal supplements are optional.
B001ECQ75A|5.0|Funny, great movie, you can watch it many times and you will enjoy it everytime. Everyone in the family enjoy it. It is great movie from the content to the music. Wonderful!
B00065MDRW|5.0|Before you even open this album up you owe it to yourself to study the cover for a minimum of fifteen minutes. Okay, now you are prepared for what you are about to encounter. The debut, and perhaps the most commercial of King Crimsons' early work, it was evident to most that this was the start of something different and, if you were into it, a leap outside of something most of us simply referred to as \\"Rock\\". Progressive Rock, if you will, was about to take us somewhere we had never been before. All the songs are good so I won't go into a song by song critique. Much like my first statement I think that aside from listening to the music you owe it to yourself to find the lyrics if you are not privileged to own the actual vinyl original. That helps to complete the experience and is very much a part of this King Crimson effort.
B0013FXWU6|5.0|\\"Ladies and gentlemen, if I say I am an oil man, you will agree.\\" And so begins our affair with Daniel Plainview. He is an intense man. He squints out of one eye, glaring at the rest of humanity over a drunken-gaze. Completely ruthless. A vicious, cut-throat bastard whose ego is only matched by his wealth. The only thing this man has, or will, ever love is money. Basically, he's Charles Foster Kane without the regret. And yet, you can't help but root for him at every turn in the story. Why is that? As I mentioned, he's completely ruthless. (As demonstrated in the scene where he is talking with H.W. about buying the Sunday family's ranch. \\"I'm not going to give them oil prices. I'm going to give them quail prices.\\") Perhaps it's his charisma. He just exudes it. Almost to the point of being able to dupe us as easily as he dupes all of the citizens of Little Boston. The only person who sees right through him is the local preacher, the young Eli Sunday. Eli knows that Daniel is a fake. Because he himself is a fake. The only thing these two have in common is their drive to achieve wealth. This is an epic film. Monumental. Paul Thomas Anderson is without a doubt the greatest film-maker working today. And he only keeps getting better and better. I look forward to his next film. (Though how he's going to follow this, I have no idea...) Many people, including myself, have compared this film to Citizen Kane. I do so, too, because, like Kane, this film was basically ignored by the Academy. There Will Be Blood is one of those once-in-a-lifetime films that will be remembered as being one of the greatest of all-time. If not, it most certainly contains one of the most memorable quotes in years. I don't want to spoil it for you here, though.
B0017PCW62|5.0|I'm not surprised that Roadrunner re-releases most of their catalog as they've been doing for years especially the last year or so including reissues from Death, Sepultura, Madball, Front Line Assembly and Life Of Agony. The latest: two from Type O Negative. The first was their debut Slow, Deep And Hard back in March. Now, Bloody Kisses. I'm sure fans are fuming to see this classic reissued especially after it was first reissued a year after it originally came out. The difference with that one was not only did it feature a newer track and an altered tracklisting, but two of their best songs were omitted due to certain stylistic differences with the songs and the overall tracklisting. Here, you get the whole deal. Not only is the album (original tracklisting and all) remastered, but you get a bonus cd with \\"Suspended In Dusk\\" and other tracks. In my opinion, this is THE Type O Negative album to own. If you had to get just one, this would be it. Even if you're not a fan, it's a hard one to pass up. Get the \\"Top Shelf\\" Edition.

B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|I spent two hours on a wonderfully sunny Saturday afternoon to see Star Trek and it was worth every minute/penny. Color me impressed. If you're familiar with the series then you'll probably see several characters you know, just in a younger form:<br /><br />If you haven't seen the series though then fear not because that's definitely not a pre-requisite. Other than saying that this movie is a pre-quel to the popular old school iteration of the series, there's not much I can say that without spoiling the really fun plot. Having only seen a few episodes of the original series though, I walked out not only pretty impressed and satisfied but I actually wanted to look up old episodes (which are available legally online at Hulu and TV.com and others) because it got me really interested in the show's storyline. From talking to my friend who was a fan of the series, I'm not sure how well the plot fits in with the series that succeeds it, but I have a theory that I can't share without spoiling the movie. Anyway, there were several nods to the series to give fans that giddy nerdgasm that you can only get from being in the know on the series.<br /><br />Every aspect of this movie was really enjoyable. They all came together to make a genuinely fun movie experience. I think almost every actor fit their role very well - especially newcomer Chris Pine as James T Kirk and Zachary Quinto (Sylar) as Spock. By the way, don't look at the IMDB cast list because it has a few spoilers. The plot had a few minor issues, but I didn't find any of them to be dealbreakers. The script was strong, but had a few minor issues (mainly a couple of scenes I didn't think needed to be in there) that I didn't think were very noticeable. Even though it was more than 2 hours long it really didn't feel that long and there was an ample amount of welcome comic relief sprinkled throughout the film. Oh, and the visuals were tasteful and well done. You have to expect a lot of CG in a movie like this, and that's probably the only real downside to the movie. If you're one of those purists who hates seeing CG, then you'll definitely take issue with this.<br /><br />I highly recommend running to your nearest theater to see this one. I'm actually probably going to pre-order it on Blu-ray, in fact, so that I can watch it again. It's one of those movies where I can't recall all the scenes because there were so many great scenes and they were quite dense. I'd say it's a solid A movie and appropriate for the whole family. There was almost no nudity and no bad language, although the plot may be too complex for some kids.ly real downside to the movie.

0061120081|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!!!  With all the reviews done of it, it is very hard to find anything new to add.  If you take away anything from this book, it should be Atticus' belief in respect for all humans regardless of race or abilities.  It definitely should be required reading in all high schools.
031606792X|5.0|OMG, am I the only person in the world that actually loved the final book in the series?  I know it had a too good to be true ring to it with Bella living \\"Happily Ever After\\" but isn't that the point of reading...Stepping out of reality and living a fantasy.  I know it is hard to understand a story book ending but isn't that what you were doing, READING A BOOK!?!?    Why do people have to make this book so complex?  Why is it that just because you actually read a story that ended with everyone happy you have to make the outcome something negative for yourself... Well, I loved the book and refuse to let people who wanted a sob story ending ruin it for me...
B00127RAJY|4.0|I have just started the 30 Day Shred, and as I write this, my legs, arms, and abs are in pain, but in a good way. As you are doing it, you feel muscles that you probably did not know you had, and she makes sure to work you on every one. I also really appreciate Anita & Natalie (I think) in the background - one is for more beginner exercisers and the other is for more advanced. People here are NOT lying to you, though - she is TOUGH. There are no breaks, unless you count lying on your back doing strength training. You will have to do 30 seconds of jumping jacks, 30 seconds of jump rope, right back to jumping jacks. It is a good workout - I was sweating so hard afterwards.    The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is because your success depends on what you are tryign to gain from this. If you need to lose serious weight, you are not going to do so from this video alone. Phase 1 burns an estimated 240 - 260 calories, and I think it goes up another 20 - 30 calories in Phase 2. To lose weight, you must burn more calories than you consume, so 250 calories is not going to do it alone. I heard from many people that they lost at most 5 lbs from completing 30DS. I have decided to alternate the 30DS with other exercising in order to maximize weight loss. As long as you are aware of this, I recommend fitting this workout into your exercise regime.
B000MRAAJM|4.0|Highly recommended....a must own.  The nature series of the decade.  Narrated by David Attenborough.  Picture quality will knock your socks off on a properly set up video system.  My only complaint is that the behind the scenes \\"making of\\" footage is not included in this version.
0452289963|4.0|This is a good book. It's true, as some of the negative reviews point out, that it is a bit \\"Buddhism for Dummies\\", but though I've read a lot of Buddhist literature and meditated with others at a local Zen Center, I guess I'm also still a \\"dummy\\". It makes the teachings accessible, and there's nothing wrong with that. It's worth the time it takes to read it.
B0000029LG|3.0|With an unstoppable first disc of super-duper hits, it takes a pretty inept follow through to render this pompous portrait unworthy, and while HIStory 2 didn't totally wreck image (after all, a few powerful numbers exist- Earth Song arguably being his last stab at anthemic pop brilliance) a majority of sodded techno, pulsating to Jackson's angry tirades attempting to stay relevant, with a side order of sappy Broadway sentiment berates the infectious pop purity he used to seemingly summon at whim.
074356619X|5.0|This audio book is a great source of inspiration and energy for supporters of positing thinking. Good quality, easy to follow, full of pratical advice.
B000QRIGLC|2.0|I would agree with the reviewers who lamented many of Luttrell's shortcomings, most notably the amount of time spent rehashing the number of push-ups, the pounding of the table regarding Texas, and his constant self-promotion. However, the real nails in the coffin are his disrespect for that which makes us a civilized society: the rule of law (would he really have murdered the innocents?), the value of the Fourth Estate, and the rights and freedoms that we enjoy because of our warriors fighting in foreign lands, things that you would hope Luttrell would have been championing instead of bashing. Ah well, nothing like making it harder for the rest of us...
B001O7JHJ8|5.0|Considering what a terrific band they are, I've never understood why Erasure is not more popular in the US.  I was also perplexed about the title \\"40 Hits\\" for this compilation, since I thought I knew all their biggies and it certainly didn't add up to 40.  So I was very happy to discover that just because Americans didn't fully appreciate Andy and Vince's output, clearly the rest of the world did and this CD is an outstanding validation of how fabulous their music is. I'm playing it constantly - at home, in the car, at work.  The music is highly infectious and you simply cannot maintain a bad/sad attitude with their bouncy, totally feel-good, party-ready sing alongs.
B0020MMB9E|5.0|If you like wholesome, delicious, nutritious food and Jamie Oliver, this cookbook is for you. On his TV show, Jamie goes into the garden and picks what is in season. He then takes you into his back yard or his indoor kitchen, which has both traditional and wood stove, and makes what he's preparing look fun, engaging and almost effortless. If you enjoy his show you'll love this book. The BCR Cook.
B001P9KR8U|2.0|Let's admit it: if it wasn't for all the hype that surrounded this film until the Oscars, no one would have seen it.  While it certainly has an interesting storyline, it's not a film that I particularly remember long after I left the cinema.  Dev Patel and Frieda Pinto do a nice job but the film only gets interesting (for me anyway) late in the second half.  A bad film?  No, far from it.  Oscar-worthy?  That's debatable especially since Frost/Nixon did a much better job conveying to the viewer the affect of the Richard Nixon years.  This film will inspire debates for years to come on whether it was political liberal pandering or good storytelling that garnered awards.  Still, I urge people to see the movie and judge for themselves.  It's worth a rental anyway.
B001AVEJ1Y|1.0|It was written by the Same Screenwriters as transformers.  Yes you got that right the geniuses who had bumblebee pee on a guy, and had optimus prime saying \\"My Bad\\".  Also there is dialogue in the bar scene that might belong in a Kevin Smith movie but not in star trek.    They Also felt the need to undo forty years and more of continuity for a movie that is as much a ripoff of wrath of khan as it is star trek nemesis and first contact.    You got Spock as an emotional vulcan.  This spock would have gotten along well with Sybok.      Kirk as a loser drop out scum rebel who talks like a druggie.      Scotty as a bumbling fool.    The enterprise bridge looks like an ipod store, and the cast is like a teen drama someone called it the OC in space.  I call it Trek 90210.    For Trek fans who feel star trek is ruined,  i felt the same  about Indiana Jones IV and the star wars prequels.
B0009XNUK0|5.0|I ordered the \\"Essential Michael Jackson\\" CD. It is absolutely wonderful! It has 30 years of Michael's music! I danced and sang to it! It is really awesome to listen to! Whoever will order it will not be dissapointed, trust me! You get The Jackson 5 and Michael's solo career! Definately worth getting! I hope everybody will enjoy it as much as I do, and always will!
1401907725|5.0|I love these cards they are such a beautiful thing!! It's hard to start talking to your Angels when you don't really know what to say. This was always my problem. The cards are an extremely useful tool to help me communicate with them. I've never had experience with cards or anything before and within a week of me having them I did a read for 3 other people, and it was completely accurate. =D Couldn't be any happier!!!
B001S86J0I|5.0|When Galaxy Quest was released in 2000, it was a modest success but it certainly didn't light the world on fire. Over the years, it has quietly amassed something of a cult following who delight in the film's affectionately satirical jabs at the Star Trek franchise and its fans, specifically the first incarnation with William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy. With this new Deluxe Edition DVD, it is about time for Galaxy Quest to be revisited and re-evaluated.<br /><br />\\"Historical Documents: The Story of Galaxy Quest\\" is a retrospective making of featurette that has key cast and crew members reminiscing about the experience of working on the film. They take us through its origins and we see how the original concept was quite different but was tweaked over time. In a nice touch, the main cast members return and tell all kinds of filming anecdotes, clearly looking back at this project with genuine affection.<br /><br />\\"Never Give Up, Never Surrender: The Intrepid Crew of the NSEA Protector\\" takes a look at the cast of Galaxy Quest and they talk about how they approached their respective roles. The filmmakers talk about why they cast the actors that are in the film and everyone dishes more wonderful stories.<br /><br />\\"By Grabthar's Hammer, What Amazing Effects\\" takes a look at the film's snazzy visual effects. They had Stan Winston do the aliens while ILM do the special effects. Winston speaks about his creations in archival footage.<br /><br />\\"Alien School: Creating the Thermian Race\\" examines the alien race that enlists the help of the Galaxy Quest crew. Actor Enrico Colantoni talks about how he came up with his character's voice.<br /><br />\\"Actors in Space\\" takes a look at how the cast made fun of their profession and their character archetypes.<br /><br />\\"Sigourney Weaver Raps\\" features a taped message that she made for her agent's birthday where the veteran actress raps with help from her fellow castmates.<br /><br />Also included are eight deleted scenes that feature more with Fred Kwan as he tours the ship's engineering section with his Zen-like calmness. There is a scene where the cast are shown their quarters based on their characters' personalities from the show. And we also get more of them bickering among each other on the alien planet.<br /><br />\\"Thermian Audio Track\\" allows you to watch the entire film dubbed in the alien language, which is actually pretty funny but I don't know if you would ever watch it more than once.<br /><br />Finally, there is a theatrical trailer.ng section with his Zen-like calmness.

1401207529|5.0|A book that Ive looked for a while. I've always said when the ROOTS aren't ignored, it makes for a better story. Also i heard through the pipeline that this was the book that helped Chris Nolan iron out the story that would become the movie \\"Batman Begins.\\" A side that attracted Christian Bale to the role.<br /><br />  A side of the story that hasn't been explored a lot. His actual hardship well before he donned the cape and cowl. The making mental notes to make sure his mistakes aren't made a second time. The learned processes put through the paces on petty thieves, before being honed on crime bosses.<br /><br />The artwork's crudeness (or for lack of better word) matched perfectly the beginnings of hero! I was never a big fan of Frank Miller, but this made me give Frank another looksee!
143911000X|3.0|The Bro Code is a light hearted read... very simple and strongly related to the \\"How I met your Mother\\" TV show character Barney Stinson.  The quality of the book Amazon sent me was very poor... the pages look like they had been photo copied with a lot of black smudges... I would recommend buying this book in a book store where you can see what you are getting. I didn't complain about the quality as it was ledgible and a quick read...
B001MDXOBQ|4.0|I thought this might have been fixed, after the previous reviewer's issue, but it isn't.  This isn't the explicit version.  Although I will say, Amazon was very pleasant and prompt to refund my money for the purchase, though.      I like the service and the products here, I just wish I had the whole song(s).    btw, the album is great.
B001IBIQU6|5.0|Like many others, I was not a big fan of this CD when I first listened to it. Had I come on here and rated this at that point, I'd give it 3 stars. But, having listened to it quite a few times, it's a 5 star CD. The song Wrong is one of their best ever.
B001AVEJ1Y|4.0|Well folks, it's the same 'ol Star Trek.  This movie labors very hard to reinvent the tone of the old series only to lead it to exactly the same place we left it.  This film, like many of the previous Star Trek films, is not SCI-FI, but rather space opera like the Star Wars films.  The best episodes of the show and the best films were always about some sort of social dilemma or the discovery of the unknown out in the mysterious universe, it is what seperated Star Trek for many fans.  Sadly, I have to report that the new Star Trek isn't that, but rather action adventure in the same vein as The Wrath of Khan, The Search For Spock, The Undiscovered Country or First Contact.  Ah, but it's not quite up to par with those other space opera episodes of the film series either.  You see those episodes had one thing that also made them above average action adventure, they had interesting character conflict and character beats and development.  This film reintroduces and redevelops the characters at a younger age so we lose some of that for now, at least until the next installment.<br /><br />These days I avoid any internet reports about any upcoming films to avoid any surprises that the trailer didn't already ruin.  I did hear Leonard Nimoy was going to play Spock's father in the film, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that to be untrue.  Nimoy plays the older Spock from the future, a future that takes place after the last installment of the old Trek movie series.  His time travel alters all the old characters at a younger age, giving the filmmakers an excuse to change the old origins and events while not diminishing the original time line that the fans are obsessed with.  It's one of the few clever conceits this new film has that made me smile.  Sure, fantasty Sci-Fi has overused time travel as a plot device, especiallly Star Trek sequels, but this was novel enough and clever enough to warrants its existance.  There's so much Trek lore the various films and t.v. series carry with them that it is easier just to erase it with time travel mking it a remake while not saying the originals never happened.<br /><br />The time travel plot also manages to change the character of Kirk ever so slightly.  Now he's a talented you8th with a chip of his shoulder.  He mourns never knowing his father, he was killed when 'something' came through a time worm hole in the opening of the film.  He now is trying to live up to his father's laurels for very different reasons then he was in the original series.  The acting in this film is all fine.  Nothing spectacular but all serviceable in representing their character archetypes set up with other actors. from the old show.  The film boils down to Spock and Kirk with Mccoy on the sidelines ever so slghtly, this was the original series main character triangle with everyone else shading details in on the side.  Mccoy gets a bit slighted on this outting but Karl Urban does a spot on impression of Deforest Kelly.  He's quite good and funny, but I hope in future installments they give him something original to do.  The film labors so much on the set up one gets the feeling that the real new Trek film will be this film's sequel.<br /><br />The effects are good but nothing special.  There's nothing in this film that you haven't seen in other space films.  It's done well but nothing awe inspiring.  The action scenes are of the Indiana Jones school.  If you have any doubt or argument about whether this Trek is a space opera or not, then I lead the court to exhibit C: the sword fight on the drill outside of earth.  Why in a future where intergalactic space travel is a reality would anyone A). carry a sword or dagger or B). fight with one to save the world?  They wouldn't.  Only in a film that is more concerned with adventure then logic or true Sci-Fi.  It gets the serialized action tropes right despite how silly the logic is or always has been.  Don't get me started on the parachutes.  It's exciting and fun none theless.<br /><br />The problems I have with this film have to do with the weight of the actual plot.  Not enough time is spent with Eric Bana's Romulan villain.  We never really feel his pain so much that we get his justification of why he is doing what he is doing in this film.  I guess we could chalk it up with him being nuts, that's always a cheap way to fill in a character hole in the plot.  Also, if your're going to use time travel in your story, could these damn screenwriters please at least attempt at illustrating it as this earth shattering, unreal and truly amazing event or discovery?!?!!?!?  The characters just found out that time travel is a reality and no one seems that impressed, even for a second!  Spock's reaction I get, but Kirk?  Finally, the characters are in such broad stokes that they end up being slightly colored cyphers.  Kirk especially.  We get glimpses of him before the academy but nothing really insightlful.  I would've enjoyed seeing the young Kirk struggling and succeding while chasing skirts at the academy.  This is where no Star Trek has truly gone before, a true prequel starring the orignal characters.  The main plot of this film is so slight I don't see why more focus couldn't have been put there.<br />SIDENOTE: Note to screenwriters, PLEASE, EVERY TIME THERE'S A BAR AS A SETTING FOR A SCENE, NO MORE DAMN BAR FIGHTS!!! It's such a boring and oversused cliche of action films and i'm really sick of it.  It's like every time you see a bar you know it's coming, BLAH!<br /><br />So, ultimately, the film is fun and exciting and a fast time in the theater, but the summer season is lacking this year, and we're only two in with this and Wolverine.  We're promised innovation on old ideas but being delivered the goods in lesser and lesser degrees.  This is better then Wolverine, but not by much.  Though, with this film I think the sequel could really improve upon the premise with all the set up strands established in this film.  If not, then I'm might be done with Star Trek for a while.<br /><br />PS:  There are actually loser fanboys on this site complaining about how Kirk became a captain without graduating the academy, and then they go on to compare it to the real military!!!!  Really?  I guess you didn't like Rocky or The Karate Kid or many other human fantasty or otherworldly fantasy films?  This Trek makes Kirk a wonderkind student and then he commandeers a ship and successfully completes a mission that saves the world.  They pushed him through to a graduation day early for saving the world.  It's not real, it's fantasy, okay? Geez.  Take some of your God's, Shatner's, advice and GET A LIFE!have with this film have to do with the weight of the actual plot.  Not enough time is spent with Eric Bana's Romulan villain.

B000VT6FAO|3.0|I think this is the best album anyone form the Depeche camp has created since Ultra.  Has several songs that are quite good...not great, but good.  More variation than recent Depeche efforts...and frankly, better lyrics.  Again, I recognize that comparing to recent DM is a bit of a low standard, but I would offer that DM fans would be better off buying this album than any of the last ten years.  Keep up the good work Dave...you have impressed me here.  I hated Paper Monsters and panned it.  This shows that he does have promise as a songwriter.  I would like to see Gore and Gahan disband DM and branch out to a series of collaborations with more experimental artists...Brian Eno, Scott Walker, Mark Hollis, David Sylvian...all would be nice.
B001TOD92C|3.0|This movie was just ok.  The story moves at a slow pace.  Often times there is alot of silence, and no dialogue.      Rourke looks like such a freak with his bizarre plastic surgery, I found it distracting looking at him.  He doesn't even look human. Seeing tears roll down a frozen face is no effective. Having long greasy hair doesn't make someone a great actor in a role.  It just makes him desperate.    There is ALOT of nudity in this movie.  I guess Tomei was getting desperate for a script. The fake wrestling, was so absolutely ridiculous, as it is on TV.  Can't belive people actually think it is real.  Having to script their moves prior to a match...is no match.    The ending is TERRIBLE!  It leaves the viewer hanging and there is just a black screen for 20 seconds or so before you realize......thats it! Dumb.    I rented this, thank goodness.  It certainly isn't worth buying or paying $10 bucks at the movies!!
B001UREJWM|4.0|I found the album to be an overall solid set of new material from the Black Sabbath Mark II era.  However, I will have to agree with some of the other reviews about the lyrics.  Although RJD's lyrics have always been somewhat cryptic in meaning to say the least, it appears he's repeated several lines we've heard before in Black Sabbath (for example, the \\"smile\\" line) on this album.  Notwithstanding, the album does grow on you the more you listen to it, as I found a natural flow to the track listing.  Dio, Iommi, and Butler all deliver excellence as masters of their craft.  I'm satisfied it's lived up to the hype.

B001R4MEYS|4.0|This is a pretty good album, much more prog than previous releases: there's banjo riffs, keyboards, and some tracks have an almost ambient feel to them.<br /><br />I like it, it's not nearly as intense as Blood Mountain overall, but that's not a bad thing.  The album art is pretty cool, I got the pre-release thing with the accompanying DVD, and that was neat too.<br /><br />I say buy it, you won't be sorry.
B000YRY8BG|5.0|When I saw the movie, I felt there was something missing with the way the Russel Crowe character was developed... He was far too central in a manner that appeared as though EVERYTHING eminated from his know-how... how god-like is that? Glady I sat through the movie (I did like it) and learned that it was based on a BBC teleplay. I ordered the DVD and as I watched it I could see that much of the Crowe's movie character seemed very much a composite of characters that were in the BBC production. The DVD showed other reporters that, like real beat reporters, have a particular expertise in their given assignments. The movie showed a rivalry between blogger versus print... The BBC production presented the cooperation between the reporting team. The movie lost that on the audience, instead EVERYTHING centered on Crowe. The BBC DVD had a good and realist ensemble of beat reporters in character. The pulse of the newsroom was depicted rather well, with its hard-nosed and quirky characters was done with some accuracy. All-in-all I was taken away with the BBC production. It had very strong character development that I believe was lost on the move. I'm grateful that TV production provided so much more. John Simm was also brilliant in \\"Life on Mars\\" another favorite which also is far better than its US-counterpart.
1423101472|5.0|At first I was bummed that The Last Olympian was going to be the final chapter of Percy Jackson and his demi-god friends.<br />Until...I read the Riordan's acknowledgements page of the book...\\"As the first Camp Half-Blood series draws to a close, I have so many people to thank.\\"<br />That sentence from Rick Riordan seems to hint there will be more Camp Half-Blood adventures featuring more demi-gods coming to camp - hopefully Percy and friends will be part of them, but this gives me hope.<br /><br />The last book of THIS series of books was a non-stop adventure between the kid demi-gods, the gods who are their parents, and the Tital army, moving towards NYC to go up the Empire State Bldg, where Mt. Olympus is hanging way up above it.<br /><br />The conflicts from all the books, the mythological creatures featured, and the maturing of the characters we have come to love has been masterful. Riordan has done his mythological homework in this series - I am Greek and have studied mythology, and can speak and read Greek, and the wording of the Greek and translations were spot on.<br /><br />With Percy Jackson, Riordan has brought all things good about the Olympians that the gods and goddesses have seemed to forget - integrity, honor, bravery.<br />The true reason the Titans got such a big army was from dissatisfied demi-gods who were mistreated and lesser gods who felt they had no sayso in the Pantheon.<br /><br />It sometimes takes a child to point the way.<br />If Riordan isn't Greek, to me he's an honorary one!<br /><br />I look forward to more Camp Half-Blood adventures - with new kids born of gods and goddesses with mortals. And those frisky gods, you know there will be plenty of them!<br /><br />This series, and particularly this book in such detail integrates all the myths and gods and legends it is mind boggling. But such great fun! Riordon's imagination is stunning!<br /><br />This is one series that is best read from book 1 on - and what fun that is.<br />Fantastic read and fantastic series!
0385333846|5.0|Kurt Vonnegut's picaresque prose lacks parity with any mainstream literature.  His unique style is inundated with seemingly random circumstances that are simply dripping with deeper meaning.  Slaughter House Five is most closely identified as an anti-war novel because of its intimate descriptions of the Dresden fire-bombings.  Much like critically acclaimed novel, The Things They Carried, Vonnegut takes a more personal approach to his overall work of fiction.  Vonnegut devotes numerous pages to the back story of his decision to write what he calls his, \\"Dresden novel\\" which is told in the first person, yet the other side to the novel is the narrative of the life of Billy Pilgrim presumably the fictional representation of the author.  Changing perspective and the clever fusion of reality with blatantly fictional additions to the storyline make slaughter-House five a work of literary genius.  Vonnegut breaks the monotony of literary single-point perspective and uses the change from a more personal account of events to a narration of the more ethereal plot progressions to make his novel both personal and at the same time intensely metaphorical. The start of the novel is primarily a first person account of Vonnegut's struggle to come to terms with his experiences in Dresden and finally sit down and write a novel that adequately addressed his experiences.  The outcome of his decade long struggle was his ground-breaking novel, Slaughterhouse Five and the extra time that was taken is apparent in the refined nature of the novel. Vonnegut uses the majority of the novel to develop the story of his literary incarnation, Billy Pilgrim from the third person.  The story of Billy Pilgrim presumably follows the story of Vonnegut's experiences in WWII however; the story of Billy Pilgrim has some important fictional qualities which make up the largest part of the novels metaphorical quality.  As one reviewer aptly stated, \\"Billy Pilgrim's odyssey through time reflects the mythic journey of our own fractured lives as we search for meaning in what we are afraid to know.\\"  The story of Billy Pilgrim reflects not only our own voyages through time but more importantly, Vonnegut's and it is this infusion of the narration of Vonnegut's personal struggle to come to terms with Dresden that makes this novel one for the ages.  Slaughterhouse Five open's the eyes to the unseen atrocities of war and allows for even the most distant reader to become sympathetic to the effects of war on the body, soul, and mind.  This novel challenges the reader to take a journey into the depths of their own mind and to find those things that they struggle to understand.  Vonnegut's challenge to the reader has more sway because of the way he demonstrates his personal struggle with understanding the Dresden massacre.  Without Vonnegut's narration of his own struggle with Dresden, Slaughterhouse Five would remain significant as an anti-war novel, but with his personal account this novel touches the heart and mind of any who are willing to let the novel challenge their way of thinking.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|A real masterpiece, Danny Boyle at his best. A great film in all aspects, well written, beautifully shot and wonderfully acted.    Danny Boyle takes you on a rollercoaster ride through lives of three children of the slums of Mumbai as they battle tragedy, despair, separation and poverty to reach adulthood. Though their journey is tough it is warmly told, with humour and without a single note of pity. This film is not always comfortable viewing but the viewer is rewarded with a magnificent tale of betrayal and loss, of love and hope and the ultimate triumph of the human spirit.    You must see this film.

B001KVZ6F2|4.0|I may be one of the few to think \\"Gran Torino\\" to be an over-rated movie. But watching Clint Eastwood play a cranky old racist who finally gets melted by a pair of adolescent Asian immigrants felt wholly contrived to me. Walt (Eastwood) has shiftless and greedy family members who he can't stand, neighbors that disgust him, a young priest who he treats like a punk and a few old cronies at the bar he can make racist jokes with. But when he discovers the kid who first tried to steal the Gran Torino of the film's title ain't the gang-banging type, Walt decides he will make a real man out of the kid and make up for the failed sons he thinks he didn't teach right.<br /><br />Which makes him the Cop from the even worse movie, \\"Crash.\\" \\"Gran Torino\\" earns its fourth star based on Eastwood, who plays Walt with such effortless slyness that he manages to coast through the movie on sheer force of will. The other is the teenage Hmong sister Sue (Ahney Her), who has picked up American spunk and sasses to Walt in a manner that makes him learn acceptance (sort of). When Walt stops a bunch of gang members from attacking Sue and her brother (with the infamous \\"Get off my lawn\\" trailer quote), Walt becomes their reluctant hero...and the gang's new enemy.<br /><br />As the conflict builds and Walt moves towards the inevitable gang showdown, \\"Gran Torino\\" stumbles. I could guess the ending from a mile away, and seeing the previously stone-cold racist Walt suddenly make this kind of turn-about felt too \\"feel-good\\" to not ring false. Anyone but Eastwood would have made this a car-wreck, but in his skilled hands, \\"Gran Torino\\" remains a decent movie to watch.

0743454537|5.0|There are books you read, enjoy and then move on. This is most certainly NOT one of those. This story will move you like very few books can. The story is haunting, touching, heart-wrenching, and will leave you questioning your own heart and beliefs. I read this book about 10 years ago for the first time and I have recommended this book more times than I can count. I reread it every few years and I am left in tears every time. Jodi Picoult has an absolute gift for moral dilemmas that leave you moved and stay with you. I also highly recommend Nineteen Minutes, Plain Truth, Tenth Circle, Keeping Faith, and Perfect Match all by the same author, Jodi Picoult.
B000065V3H|3.0|As I plan to head back into the 80's with occassional reviews that I plan on doing, I came across this 1987 film that I was never overly familiar with, but I remember seeing way back when. It was never in the group of \\"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\\", or \\"Sixteen Candles\\", \\"The Breakfast Club\\", or \\"Fast Times At Ridgemont High\\" for me, and after having now seen it for the first time since the 80's, still isn't, but that's okay. It doesn't have to be. It's a fine little film all on it's own. So, what's the plot?....    Patrick Dempsey(who is pretty much known as \\"McDreamy\\" nowadays)plays Ronald Miller, a 17 year high school kid who mows people's lawns over the summer. Ronald is not one of the cool kids. Hangs with the \\"loser\\" crowd, has glasses, unruly hair, etc. For years, he has had a crush on the most popular girl in school(of course he did)named Cindy Mancini(Amanda Peterson, and who wouldn't when your as adorable as Amanda?). When Cindy finds herself in a jam, Ronald swoops in to the rescue....but at a price. He wants Cindy to hang with him for a month and act like they are an item, in hopes of making himself more popular at school and getting to belong with the cool, popular kids. The plan goes into motion and works, but maybe it works a little too well, and Ronald will soon have to come to realize what's more important - being somebody your not to belong, or being liked and accepted for who you are.    Plot-wise, \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" is not exactly original, but what makes it work is that it is performed sweetly, naturally, and honestly. You see what happens to Ronald and how it touches everyone around him, for better or worse. One of the best aspects is his relationship with his best friend, played by Courtney Gains, and the lows that come with it once Ronald becomes popular. Their confrontation in the video arcade is affective. Most of the cast are 80's types, but it's two main stars, Patrick Dempsey and Amanda Peterson, bring sweet life to the characters that helps make it's plot less obvious. Okay, it's obvious, but they make it likeable and watchable. Dempsey does a great job as geeky Ronald, popular Ronald, and back to geeky Ronald. We like him and feel sorry for him in the start, and then are shocked and disgusted with him and the way he acts and treats others when he becomes one of the \\"cool kids\\", and then it's back to liking him again and wanting him to have what he wants when the old geekster comes back to the forefront. Amanda Peterson is the popular girl, but she plays it with a sweetness that never makes Cindy Mancini a nasty caricature of these types of characters - Popluar captain of the cheerleading team with her own little clique. Life isn't exactly a bouquet of roses for her either. The two of them, and their characters, really make the film. Elsewhere, you will find a young Seth Green(\\"Buffy\\", \\"Austin Powers\\") as Ronald's little brother, Chuckie. He's a hoot in the role. Ronald's father is played by Dennis Dugan, who went on to become a successful comedy director, having filmed a lot of of Adam Sandler's films.     What's not to like about the movie?. Not much. \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" won't win any awards for originality, and that's probably the only big thing going against it. For most of the movie, it never delved into cheesiness, until the end. Ronald's final speech outside in the cafeteria bringing the \\"cool\\" and the \\"not so cool\\" kids together gets washed away with a little too much cheese with big, sweeping music played as it goes along, but this can be overlooked when you have such a charming little movie played very well by it's two main stars. I love the 80's. Some see the dated fashions and everything else as a detriment to these films, but that couldn't be further from the truth. It enhances the movie and helps make it what it is. It only adds to the charm.    At the end of the day, \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" is a pleasant, harmless, little comedy, that has grown over the years into a real teen/high school classic for a lot of people. No, Ronald, you can't buy love, but you can achieve it by staying true to who you are.
B000UR9T82|4.0|The picture quality is among the best I have seen for a blu-ray. The sound quality is pristine. I rocked the house playing it through my home theater system. The reason it got 4 stars was for the lack of special features for both Spider-man and Spider-man 2. This set included Spider-man 2.1(Extended Version), which was nice, so the trilogy is almost a quadrilogy. I waited for a price-drop since I had all on dvd prior to my purchase.
B0019T9FL6|5.0|This is the hottest cd out now. It is a mixture of all types of music, Soul, R&B, Rap Gospel, Love Songs, Power Songs. I love it and I would buy 10 copies if I could. Jennifer Hudson did a fabulous job on this CD and she is defiantly a star. She has so much talent and will be successful for along time
B001SGEUNI|5.0|I used to see these Guys at the Tourist Inn in York, almost in they're backyard of Red Lion, PA and at the Chameleon Club in Lancaster, PA, they always put on a great show and you knew that some day they would be huge!, we waited for 4 long years for this CD and it was worth it, here's hoping Atlantic records gives them the support they need!,Good luck to Lizzy and the rest. pick up this CD you won't be sorry.
630587493X|5.0|This was a movie I hadn't seen for a long time.  I was realy excited to see it again. Excellent acting and story line.
B0018RWD6I|5.0|These days John Coltrane is followed with an almost religious fervour, which is appropriate for someone who made quite possibly the greatest devotional music since the days of JS Bach. The secret of this is that the music never preaches at you but simply has Coltrane trying to musically describe his love for the almighty.    The highlight of this album is obviously Coltranes ultra-expressive tenor sax playing which was once famously described as \\"sheets of sound\\" but the playing of the rest of the quartet is also exquisite, especially Elvin Jones' incredible drumming. At a time when most music seems to be about bling and ho's here is music that is both virtuosic and speaks to its listeners personally. If you have any interest in jazz or want to listen to truly brilliant music you have to have this.
B001UOVP1S|4.0|I love this album, from an urban perspective. It's a different approach to   Timbaland's infectious beats. Most of the bad reviews come from those expecting a rock approach. It's hard for me to compare because I'm not familiar with Soundgarden. If you like him, give him credit for extending his artistic range.
1423101472|5.0|My advanced 4th grade students read The Lightning Thief during the last few weeks of school.  This gears them up and they keep asking to borrow the next book and the next book in the series. This series spurs a lot of curiosity about Greek mythology, which is a great way to tie into Greek root words, superheroes and graphic novels.  As a reader, the series is SO satisfying, on par with Harry Potter, and more accessible due to the American hero and setting it in the US.  Percy is a priceless male character- smart-mouthed, imperfect, goofy and bad with conversation with girls.  The conflicts are satisfyingly resolved in this last story, but I hate to see it end.  Its painful to say goodbye, but Percy leaves in style. I do suspect that Mr. Riordan's message to parents to NOT IGNORE YOUR KIDS might be a not too subtle connection to working in a private school as a teacher for many years.  Bless his heart for really liking kids.  It comes across in the quality of the stories he's shared.
B000000OTY|5.0|If you are not a Peter Gabriel fan then you will be after listening to this double album. If you are a fan and don't have this album, then buy it now. The live versions of Come Talk To Me, and Blood of Eden are more stirring and passionate than on the studio albums. This album from the 1993 World Tour is the standard by which other live albums must be compared. Kudos to David Taraskevics for superb recordings. You are a recording engineer par excellence. Thank you, thank you, thank you.     The band is sensational to say the least. Tony Levin on bass is superb as is Jean Claude Naimro on keyboards, David Rhodes on guitar and Shankar on violin. Manu Katche who has played with Sting and Eric Clapton, replaces Jerry Marotta on drums and is awesome.     In case you do not know, these recordings are from the large venue shows in the United States and Europe. Paula Cole sings primary backup vocals during the European tour and she is wonderful. Check out her albums such as This Fire, Harbringer, and Amen. Other backup singers include Papa Wemba, Reddy Mela amissi and Styno Mubi Matadi. This is World music at it's best.     There are so many great songs and performances that it is extremely difficult to anoit one or two as best. Besides classics like Come Talk To Me and Blood of Eden, other stirring tracks are Red Rain, Diggin In the Dirt, Secret World, In Your Eyes and Shaking the Tree. However, this is not to belittle the other tracks. This is an outstanding double album from beginning to end.    I have watched the DVD and think the audio tracks are better mixed on this version. However, the DVD is enjoyable to watch for the visuals and performances. But, I recommend this version if money is a factor. I have a top-of-the line NHT audio system (speakers, pre-amp, amp, crossover and secondary amp for sub-woofer) and this album is better than most other live concerts that I have heard, The recordings and mixes are simply spectacular. Even if you are not a Peter Gabriel fan,this is a treasure.
142312166X|4.0|Some of this backstory is really necessary to the last book in the series.  I recommend that everyone who has read the other four books keep this one in mind,  And I thought the illustrations were great, except I pictured Poseidon more like Tom Selleck circa Magnum PI.
0385512058|4.0|Keith Farrazzi has taken networking from an art best practiced by people with certain hard wiring and personalities, to a science that even an old bore can implement with great success.  I recommend this to anyone who wants to build deeper relationships or relationships with more people.  Being a gregarious person, I didn't think I would get much out of this read.  However, I was pleasantly surprised with a few gem ideas that only require simple discipline to put into practice.  No matter your current aptitude, you will grow as a result of Never Eat Alone.
B00164KYV4|5.0|Good movie...It even vbeat me at saying lines...like come up lines...the one they kept repeating...I loved it...
B00005N6KG|5.0|These are great earphones for the price. These are my second pair puchased. My first ones lasted a couple of years, which is not bad. They were stuffed in drawers, pockets, etc. so they were not treated gingerly, but still held up very well. i have a hard time getting earbuds/phones that stay in or on while running, so these \\"in the ear\\" and \\"over the head\\" phones are perfect. The adjustment works well for a good fit.
B0001906O0|5.0|quite every included songs are really great! there are a lot of unknown songs, at least not included in official releases so tipically not easy accessible. even the songs related of last Cure's period are often very interesting. many of those \\"new\\" songs are really great and the quoting from Robert Smith at the beginning of the inside book is definitely true \\"I always expected great b sides from musicians I love, ginving a different view about them\\". finally, the included book is quite interesting... maybe it can be more interesting including more biographic details about musicians, but anyway it's interesting since they tell the story about each song included in the box set.  definitely a must have for everyone that can love Cure's music (I mean, not only for \\"crazy\\" fan ;) or it can be really a great way to discover it
4770030096|2.0|This book is not for busy people. The book is almost written completly in Hirigana. If you haven't mastered this your sunk. The CD is not much help as well. Much too fast with very little explination.
B000RJO578|5.0|\\"Hot Fuzz\\" is one of the greatest satires of all time. It's heartwarming, charming, outrageous and super memorable. If you've seen \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" expect the same smorgasbord of genres here. There's a little parody, a little \\"British TV\\" comedy, a little drama, a little mystery, a little horror... It's all here! I can honestly call this one of my favorite films.    A CAUTION  There are a few comments in this film that I felt were incredibly misplaced. First off the use of the \\"c\\" word towards the middle of the film was uncalled for and somewhat that I believe will shock most american viewers. Not tasteful...    Secondly, there are some extremely off color \\"double entendres\\" by the female cop that are just flat out gross. These moments are so scarce, you barely remember them when the film ends, but they're always annoying and most uncalled for.     Thirdly, the film is extremely violent... Gushing blood and decapitation are played up for laughs (and I didn't find this element offensive) but if you are squeemish, I wouldn't recommend it.    BOTTOM LINE:  Awesome movie! I really can't recommend this one enough to viewers willing to ignore a few bumps in the road.
0446677450|5.0|Product arrived quickly and was in excellant shape.<br /><br />Would definitely order from there again.
0783225547|4.0|Good action flick. Movie was filmed in the old silver mining town of Wallace Idaho. When speaking with several of the locals there, they told me they actually closed the town for a period of time while filming.. Had a great lunch there in a restaurant called the 1313.
B000X2H8G4|5.0|My mother is 91 and has been steadily losing her hearing for a number of years. She is almost totally deaf in one ear and wears a $2500 dollar hearing aid in the other, which helps very little. We have to sit close and talk quite loud for her to hear.  Last week I purchased this for her, just in case it might help.    Well, it makes a big difference. When she is sitting at the dinner table with several people around, she is now able to hear most of what is being said without anyone having to raise their voice. She is very pleased and in feeling a lot less isolated than she did previously. Certainly worth the price!
B001AVEJ1Y|1.0|Yo espero un film Star Trek y me regalan un Star Wars, es una estafa. Demasiados elementos Star Wars de la trilogía original. Un Hoth, una cantina, un Falcon Millenium disparando a diestra y siniestra, casualidades al puro estilo Star Wars o Indiana Jones. Me entretuve pero fui a ver Star Trek, y esto no lo era.
B00001OH7T|5.0|This 1975 release features the chamelion like Bowie, exploring Philadelphia soul.  The disk showcases a young Luther Vandross, who sings background and co-wrote one of the stronger tunes, \\"Fascination\\".  The cast is stellar as usual, with guitarist Carlos Alomar, Mike Garson on keys, David Sanborn on saxaphone (instead of Bowie himself), studio greats Willie Weeks on bass and Andy Newmark on drums.  The guests are great as well, including Earl Slick, who plays guitar on \\"Fame\\", Ralph McDonald, percussion on \\"Fame\\" and \\"Across the Universe\\", which also feature John Lennon on vocals and guitar.  The background vocals are powerful and provide strong support to Bowie, who croons most of the songs other than \\"Fame\\".  Tony Visconi's production layers these great musicans into the perfect sound for Bowie's exploration into the world of soul and dance music.  I recommend this.
006082543X|4.0|I actually bought this book before the movie came out.When I got the book I did not even know there was a movie being made about Coraline. I have to say though I did not see it,(because I got the jest of it from the book.)  It was a good read. But I hardly think this is a childrens story. It is rather graphic and a bit macabrae. I understand that the movie was a little bit more frightening.But I enjoyed it alot. I actually read it in one sitting. Good book. Thanks.
1932907009|5.0|The best advice for any new screenwriter always comes back to write, write, write.  You learn so much by doing the story problem solving yourself.  The great thing I've found after reading Save The Cat! is the author has taken everything he's learned from his years of problem solving, and illuminated all the \\"aha\\" moments he's had along the way, presenting them in everyday language you can pick up in seconds.  I learned so much from reading the book, but I find I come back to it as a reference book over and over again.      I think this book is a must have, because it goes into more detail.  But to really drive the points home, I learn best by example, so his second book Save the Cat! Goes to the Movies, helped me really see 1) if these beats all really exist in actual movies instead of just \\"writing theory\\", and 2) how other writers organized their stories.  I think if you read the Save the Cat books, and Iglesias' book on writing for emotional impact, you'll be well on your way to writing a great story.
0307455874|5.0|There is really not that much 2 say. I ordered the book for my mother and she loved it and she gave 2 my sister, who also loved it....
B00192KCQ0|5.0|This album has Rick Rubin written all over it with more than a hint of the Slayer style minus the double pedal drums and Tom Araya's vocals--this makes Hetfield's vocals sound a little odd initially. At times, a few instances also remind one of the cartoonish-singing-style-and-riff-progression of System of a Down!     But I'm impressed with the way Metallica has come back with a heavy offering; the key difference Metallica brings to the Heavy Metal table is their ability to churn out great songs and not just heavy music--this is a line they shouldn't digress from or the comparisons with other bands will not stop. 'Broken, Beat & Scarred' has a melodious hook that will make you re-listen to it without proceeding ahead! 'The Judas Kiss' has some slow and pounding riffs that will take you back to the Pantera era; even 'My Apocalypse' is very-very likeable. My only complaint: I wish the sound recording was not as shrill as the high frequencies almost deafened me at loud volumes.    Overall, a great album but I doubt how puritans (Metallica fans or the Slayer-heads) will treat it as--a winner, or the last nail in the coffin that is so exuberantly displayed on the album cover art!
9562916464|5.0|Planning to be stranded on a dessert island or to send a child off to college (the intellectual equivalent of same)? This is the essential book; more valuable than a Swiss army knife or dorm fridge. The \\"little book\\" has more meat and big ideas about clear thinking and clear writing than you will find in one-hundred \\"How to write\\" books. E.B. White was a genius and his genius lives here in succinct gorgeous prose. I have read it scores of times since it was assigned to me in college and my tattered copy still sits aside my keyboard as a roadblock to the myriad pitfalls of poor communication. Buy several copies and distribute them to your friends and relatives!
0195145925|5.0|Usually change is a difficult thing to deal with. This book is about new ideas from a very peculiar point of view. I can't say I did follow each and every detail as I would like to. I got lost quite a few times and I felt like the whole thing is a joke and then got back to trying to tag along with the ideas presented. If you want to challenge your mind with a different approach about time then you may want to consider reading this book. Again, change of mind set is definitely a challenge.
0307408833|1.0|False and misleading title. many recipes have gluten. The book is simply overhyped. we have child who has gluten free diet and wasted money. we wish for more real gluten free cookbooks
1577314808|5.0|Although this book has been out quite some time now, I decided to post a review because I am today appreciating the effect that some of the concepts in this book have had on my life, literally every day, since I encountered them.  And I believe I have been a better person (certainly happier) for them.<br /><br />All of us have pivotal moments in our lives, an event, an interaction; something that occurs and we are forever changed.  Whether for better or worse, the momentus impact of such events carry incredible power.  One of those moments occured for me with this terrific book, The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle.  I can remember everything about the moment.  I had driven to Texas to help my daughter move back to TCU for the up-coming semester.  Its a long drive (9 hours) and I knew I'd need to entertain myself on the way back, so I bought this book in audio form.  At this time of my life, I was struggling with a number of difficult things, and holding onto an enormous amount of resentment and anger.  As I traveled the Texas countryside, deftly avoiding hitting armadillos, I began to be captivated by the words being delivered by this man with, to my ear, a kinda funky accent.  And then he starting talking about the concept that struck me so powerfully I literally had to pull off the road and just listen and absorb.  Eckhart was discussing his notion that much of the time we are 'asleep', reacting out of habit to the events and people.  He talked about being angry at people when they are carrying out their mindless programming is as silly as being mad at an insane person.  They are simply unaware.  This was a life-altering moment for me, I shed an incredible burden of weight of anger and resentment, it happened so fast as my own eyes were opened.  And I have been grateful ever since.  The awareness evoked by the ideas in this book are incredible and timeless.
0440180295|5.0|\\"The Things They Carried\\" is a plethora of experiences that leaves the reader to truly grasp the nefariousness of war.  Tim O'Brien's book is a plane to travel readers to places and feelings that they would normally not be capable of arriving at.  Vietnam is not a place that many high school students get the opportunity to visit, nor is war an experience that many go through at this age.  O'Brien corrects this privation by transporting readers into the lives of fictional soldiers like Rat Kiley or Curt Lemon, neither of which survive the horrors in Nam.  Their fear becomes tangible, their fear becomes the readers fear, their fear becomes imbued with importance as O'Brien attempts to guide readers through his disapprobation of war.  O'Brien writes with a profundity that can only come with personal experience, he wrote \\"The Things They Carried\\" as a memoir of his bellicose days and to promote his anti-war sentiment.  The irony in the story lies, however, in that none of the characters are real, although certain parts of the story may be true, O'Brien expounds the soldiers so that he can almost control the reader's emotions.  The soldiers experiences and feelings are such that the reader can feel the gush of wind as a bullet narrowly misses or become lugubrious at the loss of a close friend.  The readers' journey leaves them in lassitude at the effort put forth in fighting the war alongside the soldiers.   Vietnam breathes, although some may doubt that this is possible, for the soldiers Vietnam is a living entity.  What I find truly meaningful is the things the soldiers carried, not only did they have to carry their unit and their equipment they had to carry fear, love, and hope.  Fear that is constantly ruminated upon only becomes heavier and O'Brien does an excellent job of expressing this to the readers.  He also shows the unfairness in war, the men do not want to be in Vietnam, they do not want to fight, they do not want to be so far away from home.  And when the soldiers do fight as is expected of them, they come home, but life can never be the same after such an unmitigated experience as war.  Men can be left vacuous after a war they did not fight of their own volition, and because the US did not win the war in Vietnam, the soldiers did not get the respect they deserved when they returned home because the general public blamed them for fighting the war, even though they did not want to fight it in the first place.  But, as the saying goes, it's a rich man's war and a poor man's fight.     This book provides the impetus to make people realize the error of war, a necessary cathartic act that could possibly make this world a better place.  I therefore can say with perfect perspicuity and aplomb that this book deserves five stars because it is a truly heart-wrenching and enlightening story.
B001GAPC1K|4.0|Great video, menus and extras, one of the best blu ray discs available.    The image quality is incredible, but the sound is powerful.    Most people talk about the blu ray video quality, but in my humble opinion the main difference with regular dvds is the sound, the sound difference is immediately noticeable.
B001DDBCUU|5.0|If you like the Sex and The City TV series you'll love this very funny entertaining sexy movie. There are many twists and turns that peaks your interest and there are many laugh-out loud scenes. This is a must see movie if you want to have a good time with a lot of belly laughs!
B001TOVZYQ|5.0|Greatest martial arts movie I haven't seen for a long time.This movie does not only show how good the Wing Chun fighting system is ;Also actor Donnie Yen was able to portrait Master Ip Man in a very convincing way.Donnie Yen stated in his own interview that he had spent a lot of time studying the life of Ip Man with details from Ip Man's son Ip Chun.I have watched the movie for more than twenty times and each time I can still find new segment and dialogue that I found has shown the movie good story line and plot.You will be moved by this movie.In fact it won the best movie award in the Hong Kong movie academy award.Buy this movie,not the other version because this has the best english subtitle .You won't regret it.
B001GZ6QC4|1.0|This awful movie is cliche ridden and contrived like any other adventure movie and so much so that I only watched the 1st 40 minutes: It has camera angles that are dizzily swirling around and music that is over exaggerated at tense moments. The 1st Batman Begins movie was way better. Don't waste your time with this dog!
B001SGEUNI|5.0|I have never left a review for a product before but this one deserves it.  I've read the others and agree that Lizzy and the guys rock!  The lyrics are awesome and her voice is flawless.  The only correction that I might make that has been bothering me would be this.      Although I love Pat Benatar, I would compare her more to the Wilson sisters of Heart.  All the punch and then some.  Think Barracuda and Heartless and then let me know what you say ;)    This band had better go far, I want more!
0143034901|5.0|\\"A book is a mirror that offers us only what we already carry inside us, that when we read, we do it with all our heart and mind.\\"<br /><br />Stephen King writes that The Shadow of the Wind is \\"one gorgeous read.\\" He couldn't be more right.<br /><br />The novel immediately lures you in due to its unique and engrossing plot. A bookseller takes his eleven year old son to a building hidden among the debris in post war Barcelona called The Cemetery of Forgotten Books. He is not to tell anyone about it. There, in the literary mausoleum, Daniel, the boy, is allowed to choose one book to make his own--one book to give life to again. Following the maze of shelves and dusty books, he chooses The Shadow of the Wind by one Julian Carax. Little does he know how much Carax's novel will change is life.<br /><br />After devouring the novel, Daniel, searches out Carax's other books. He soon learns that Carax is shrouded with mystery and that all of his books have been burned and destroyed throughout the years. Daniel might have the last known copy. And so starts Daniel's quest to uncover the truth and solve a mystery that has been hidden for thirty years throughout the streets of Barcelona begins.<br /><br />Zafon tells the tale through Daniel's eyes. You learn with him through his investigations and prying. Daniel's life, from age eleven through nineteen is constantly juxtaposed to that of Carax's and you learn about their various similarities. The story takes bold turns and gives shocking revelations that lead up to the \\"eyes open wide, holding my breath, don't disturb me\\" finale. You care for Daniel, for his friends, and for Carax as well. And you learn that everyone is connected in one way or another--for better or for worse.<br /><br />The book, originally written in Spanish, is a true masterpiece and deserves its renowned recognition. Although the 485 pages may seem daunting, the prose is so beautiful, you don't seem to notice. The plot progresses slowly, but every description and every detour is completely worth it and almost always important. Just keep track of the characters. Admittedly, I had a hard time doing that at some points.<br /><br />What I liked most was that between the beautiful words, Zafon bestows us little lessons and quotes. Passages like, \\"A stranger sees us the way we are, not as he wishes to think we are\\" seem to stay embedded in your brain.<br /><br />I highly recommend the book for anyone who is interested in tale that weaves mystery, danger, love, and life together brilliantly in a cobweb of disguise. Or, as Daniel puts it towards the middle, \\"It's a story of love, of hatred, and of the dreams that live in the shadow of the wind.\\" I ended the novel with tears and goosebumps.<br /><br />Even though there is an epilogue, I still want to go back and visit the characters. See how they're doing. Stop in Daniel's father's bookshop and say hi. Ask if Daniel is there. See if he has any old Carax novels.<br /><br />\\"Look, Daniel. Destiny is usually around the corner.

B00003CXB4|4.0|this movie came in to me wrapped for shipping protection and without any scratches on the CD.  It was missing some of the CD inserts but that is to be expected.  The most important inserts and cover was there.
B001F290E4|4.0|SEAL and David Foster came up with a great idea and song selection for this CD and while some songs can't top the originals; for one- IF YOU DON'T KNOW ME BY NOW- by Harold and Melvin and the Blue Notes with the great vocals of Teddy Pendergrass,others will blow the wax out of your ears! SEAL shows off a wide and impressive array of singing talent and brings the soul back a much missed category called soul. This is real talent here.<br />  I would have given the CD 5 stars but as a long time Pendergrass fan I had to shine some of the stellar light back on the original.<br />  This is a CD for everybody's collection, I-POD or radio play list.

B0015DWJX2|5.0|Overtures of Ella Minnow Pea (without the missing letters) abound in this wonderfully delightful tale told through letter correspondence.  The authors captured each character precisely enough for the reader to feel intrigue and love that never waned throughout the story.  I laughed and I cried along with each character as their stories unfolded, all the while learning the history of the Channel Islands during that tumultuous period of time.
B001AVEJ1Y|4.0|Kirk, Spock, McCoy and the whole gang are back in action but this time they are young bucks ready and rearing to go.  For us true geeks there was some trepidation going into the film but once you're over that or not a Star Trek (ST) geek to begin with, then you should enjoy a fast paced and exciting ride.<br /><br />The USS Kelvin encounters an unusual phenomenon in space (is there any other kind?) and immediately comes under attack.  A series of events places George Kirk in command of the ship as his wife is whisked away.  The conclusion of this battle is probably one of the most exciting and emotionally impactful scenes I've seen in ST in some time and hooked me in.<br /><br />Jump forward and meet young Kirk and young Spock to get a taste of their childhood personalities.  Jump forward again and see their decisions to join Starfleet.  I don't want it to sound rushed but it is bam, bam, bam; meet Uhura, Bones, Sulu, Chekov, the only hold off being Scottie until later.  It serves to give us what we want, we want to see these new takes on these old characters, and it keeps the action moving at a brisk pace.  It's a relief when compared to the bogged down slow moving ST adventures we've seen at some times.  Ever try to get a non ST friend into Trek?  Well you wouldn't start with ST V or Generations; you'd pick this one or First Contact.<br /><br />There are some great nods to the fans including the infamous Kobayashi Maru scenario in which Kirk becomes the first and only person to \\"beat\\" it.  Kirk is cocky and arrogant and a womanizer but also charming and heroic as he should be.  Urban as Bones is probably the most spot on, it really was almost like seeing the young McCoy in the flesh and frankly he steals every scene he is in.  All the other performances were maybe not as close but great tributes and takes on the characters that I enjoyed quite a bit.  Each one was given a moment to shine and they all at one point or another made me laugh.  I really can't wait to see this crew again.  And a special note that Leonard Nimoy turns in a great performance and is a pleasure to watch here as well.<br /><br />There were some weaknesses in the plot, sure, and the villain, while threatening, was also maybe not one dimensional but two at the most.  The method and \\"science\\" behind his presence didn't really sell me and I personally think it would be exhausting to stay mad for decades straight, just sitting around, with singe minded intensity.  I'll give him this - the man was really mad!  But as a method to give us our \\"new\\" ST crew I'll take it.<br /><br />Should you be worried about the cosmetic changes to the ship and bridge and all?  Not a bit.  Please just watch and enjoy.  Sure, I may have toned down the bridge design a bit but there was not way to not update it with today's effects.  The ships were great and all the special effects better than anything we've seen in ST in quite some time.<br /><br />Overall if change does not scare you and you love ST and you want some more then it is here and ready to beam you aboard.

If you have small-med hands though, I feel like my fingers get sore sooner than without.  But that could just me.  They are still on and I am getting more used to them.  If I didn't like them I would have taken them off.
B000002U82|3.0|When people talk about Pink Floyd. The album most often cited as their best album is this one. And I don't really understand why. It is a good album, I can enjoy it front to back. But most of the album is simply good, not great. There are only two stand out track in my opinion: Time and Brain damage. The rest of the album does an excellent job of transition but are not worth listening on its own in my opinion. For a starter Floyd CD I'd much rather recommend Wish You Were Here or Animals. The Wall has more moments of brilliance than this album as well, but the weaker part of the Wall are too weak in my opinion, so much so that I often skip half that album just to get to the good parts(Brick in the wall pt2, Mother, Young Lust, Comfortably Numb ect...)

B001R7IHA0|1.0|I am a HUGE Keith Urban fan.  But this was not his best work.  BE HERE was his greatest album.  Might have been one of the best country albums ever!  Recommended for all collections.    But Defying gravity.......    First the good...  I LOVED Kiss a girl!  It has a chorus you can bite into, he mixes it up so good with the unexpected surprises he throws into the song, that you can hardly sing along and you really don't care because you're blasting it with the windows open and singing it at the top of your lungs anyway.  The lyrics, the arrangement, the song, it's content is PURE URBAN!  I also loved the chorus and lyrics to THANK YOU, and it is cool that it is coming from his heart.      Now the bad..  The album lacks any growth.  I can't say I'll sing along to every track like BE HERE.  Many of the choruses, bridges, and lyrics are somewhat forgettable.  I guess THANK YOU was both a surprise and disappointment.  The lyrics were really strong, the chorus was good, but the arrangement was too mechanical, Urban's style did not shine through on the song.  That song should have been even more soulful.  It seemed somewhat toned down.  I've seen him in concert, and I think now is the time to start putting some of those riffs down in the studio, Riffs, Bridges, improvisation are all great skills he has, but where are they here?    Yes it's a nice easy listen, but it's also forgettable.  I think Keith needs to get some of his edge back by trying some collaborations with some world class arrangers, producers, and co-writers, that will not only give him his groove back, but will contribute to his growth as an artist.  I don't won't to hear the same sound every time.    Also, in line with the arrangements, keith, your base is country music.  You need those banjos, mandolins, jaw harps, clacking spoons, wisky jugs, hell...even washboards to put more joy in there.  Give us some more of that \\"country comfort\\"!    Let's see what he does next.
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|This version of today's Star Trek was great.  Very entertaining, action-pack, humor and most of all good acting for one and all.  I hope this is just the beginning of good things to come in the future.<br /><br />Thank you for entertaining me and the family.  Bravo!
B00006AG5N|5.0|I never described myself as the world's greatest Elvis fan, or at least I didn't until I purchased this CD.  There is something about listening to the seemingly endless list of his #1 hits that would make anyone a believer.  Elvis was properly legend even in his own time, but this CD throws into stark relief the amazing staying power of his music and his voice.  Many of his songs have the stripped down vocals and instrumentals of a bygone age, and yet that apparent simplicity is belied by the surprising complexity of many of the arrangements.  His songs have aged extremely well, and it is amazing how just the first cords of some of his great hits will make people's faces light up with grins.  I often play this CD in the car, and some songs will make my infant daughter's feet kick in time, while others will lull her to sleep with wonderful melodies.  The King truly transcends all generations, and if you ever get tired of the braying cacophony of noise on today's radio channels this CD is the ultimate cure -- even if you're a hard headed woman and I'm a soft hearted man.

B0007DFJ0G|4.0|This was a edgy quirky movie which ultimately was a comment on the falsity and emptiness of our lives, that they are an illusion to deny the reality of death, and once we accept that reality, we are free...or are we?  Virtuoso performance by Pitt and pretty close to the book...except the ending was a somewhat cheap cop-out, if not eerily presient on the falling buildings of 9/11.

B001PPGAIA|3.0|\\"Australia\\"--was it nominated for any Academy Awards? Surely not because it doesn't deserve any. What a disappointing use of nearly three hours.<br /><br />However, the movie was worth watching for these things:<br />1. The actor who played Nulla--the best acting and the best character. I was charmed by that lovely child.<br />2. Learning that aborigines were (are?) treated just as distastefully and condescendingly in Australia as African-Americans once were in this country. Mixed race children fared worse than full-blooded whites or blacks because they didn't belong to one group and weren't accepted by the other.<br />3. The story is set at the time of World War II when walk-abouts were practiced by aborigines. I wonder if the custom is still followed.<br />4. I didn't know that Australia was attacked by Japan during WWII or that there was a \\"lost generation.\\"<br /><br />Reasons why I didn't care for this movie:<br />1. I never forgot it was a movie. To be successful, a movie must take the viewer \\"away\\" for awhile. I was constantly aware that a movie was \\"rolling\\" as I watched it.<br />2. Nicole Kidman once won an Academy Award for Best Actress? Wow, her acting was awful in this movie! What was with the knitted eyebrows all the time? And her hair? What has happened to her hair? It looks like a wig in movies or out of them.<br />3. Hugh Jackman looks great without a shirt, but he simply lacks the right sex appeal in this role, or was it being paired with Kidman that makes him so blah? What that role needed was Gerard Butler or someone like Clark Gable.<br />4. What was with Kidman and Jackman in their kissing scenes? What dead kisses! Their lack of chemistry made me think their real life spouses were on the set watching. Un-un-uhhh! No sexy kissing!<br />5. Horrors! What was David Wenham doing in such a nefarious role? That handsome actor with such a breathy voice used so outstandingly in \\"300\\" as narrator/poet now playing--and looking like-- a dirty rotten scoundrel! WHO is responsible for this outrage!<br />6. The bombed harbor scene: All I could \\"see\\" was a tiny set that could be broken and reset into a bombed harbor scene. I've seen too many behind-the-scenes production segments and recognized this kind of illusion at once. It shouldn't be so obvious!<br /><br />Now, would someone make a better epic about Australia?

B00007AJF8|5.0|This is one of the most original, quirky and hilarious movies I have ever seen.  In fact, it is the most original, quirky and hilarious movie I have ever seen.  How these guys--Charlie Kaufman and Spike Jonze ever came up with this is beyond me. I want more films and books etc from these guys.  I highly recommend this movie, but with the caveat that it may not be funny the movie for everyone.  You probably need to be off-kilter a little bit to really enjoy this movie.
0226039331|5.0|I tried to save money buying a 2nd hand copy. The seller failed to deliver to a friend in the US.

0345444051|4.0|Taking into account that Five stars = perfection, and that only a very small handful of things reach such heights, I give Childhood's End Four Stars, which is, all the way to the top without accomplishing the aforementioned perfection.     This book makes you think a lot about life, why we think and do what we think and do, what are our aims for the future, if we have the power to reach those goals or even fight for them or not. As many books from decades past, a \\"modern\\" reader may find it lacking in political intrigue or drama, shallow in characterization, etc. Nevertheless, the book was written and should be read as a debate of the human nature and it's role in this planet and beyond.     If you have not read it, please do so on a free day at the beach, lake, mountain cabin, whatever. Read it thoroughly in one day (it's quite short). Submerge yourself on the ideas presented. Close the book, serve yourself your favorite drink, and slowly think about it all again. It's quite an experience.
B000O599ZS|5.0|I have viewed this movie many times and each time I come away from it a little richer. I recently watched an 'American Masters' biography of John Ford and the narrator gave the most exact description of the Ethan Edwards character that I think can be given: 'he was the kind of man that civilization must have but also the kind that can never live in civilization'.     Society has always been faced with the need to decide whether or not it will acknowledge the honor that men like Ethan Edwards have earned. Sadly, for the past 40 years, we have been drifting away from them, preferring to think that our own politically correct 'moral rectitude' contains a self-defending mechanism. People who support this view are frequently heard warning us 'not to become like our enemies'. First and foremost, this is shameful because it necessarily devalues the sacrifice of the warrior. But it is also foolish. At some point our decadent society will need an Ethan Edwards for its very survival. The question remains as to whether we will then find him from within our midst.

B001N44BVQ|5.0|\\"Body of lies\\" is a powerful denounce, a realistic portrait between two agents. One of them (Di caprio) is assigned to infiltrate himself in order to get the location of a feared terrorist, the main chief of an organization disposed to punish and seek revenge against all of those who don't share the holy visions and doctrinal principles that support that distorted vision about the world; while the other one (Russell Crowe) is a bureaucratic agent whose avidness to get the minimum information is even able to screw up pacts and internal agreements established over the own battlefield.<br /><br />This growing lack of focus and clashes of approaches around what is priority and what is not, will lead them to an unavoidable breakthrough that eventually will collapse the main goal.<br /><br />These two visions (one from the same ground of the happenings and the other one based on theoretical principles) is nothing new. But it's a real pity the first-rate technology doesn't run parallel respect the multiple contradictions of the human behavior. This is the awful truth.<br /><br />Don't miss this rewarding and courageous film.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|Meryl Streep is amazing as she always is but she actually pulls off a singing character.  Other main characters except for the daughter,  just barely get by with their singing.  Makes you want to get up and sing and dance.
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|Every time I watch this movie, it feels like it encompasses a lifetime. You can't even review this movie, but because it's not. It's art. One of the best dvd's ever printed to, I will say. This film drove me to draw. I drew the dove transformation scene, i'm a musician, not a painter. Scarfe's animations are truly unparallelled, never to be reproduced again!     The film in my opinion, is at the absolute limits of western society's threshold for acceptance. This is an adult movie, no an adult experience meant to be viewed by EVERY open-minded individual on Earth. I had watched this film many years ago before I had ever experimented with anything. The movie has more depth to it every time I watch it is very profound. As far as intense movies go, this is on the far, far end of the spectrum. You must be prepared for this experience!    Also the Dolby Digital 5.1 surround mix is out of this world, just perfect.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|A great movie that starts off depressing and ends with a burst.  A few F words, so it would be a problem to watch as a family with young children the same age as the girl in the movie who is made to cover her ears.

0385333846|4.0|Time-travel and war: two concepts only the ingenious Kurt Vonnegut would incorporate into the same story. Although he introduces the book as a war story, Vonnegut has, in true postmodern style, managed to almost completely obfuscate the point by diverting the inattentive reader's attention to time travel and the fourth dimension. Albeit, the truly sagacious reader can pick up not only Vonnegut's alien-inspired theories about time, but also his earthling-motivated opinions about war. The self-proclaimed pacifist adheres to the tradition of using the pen to conquer the sword by equipping Slaughterhouse Five, the plaintive story of a soldier that was in Dresden during the firebombing of World War II, with heaping spoonfuls of philosophy and humor to help the realities go down.   Vonnegut tells the life story of Billy Pilgrim the same way clouds cry and drop their tears: in so specific order whatsoever as to vivify our consciousness. That's where the time-travel and alien abduction comes in. No hyperbole. What else would you expect from \\"a master of contemporary American literature?\\" I wouldn't want to give too much away, but Pilgrim's pilgrimage through the iniquities of time, space, love and war leave him surprisingly without vehemence, despite seemingly endless exposure to contagion that often leaves the feckless hero lurid and not pristine. His indifference, surprisingly, induces in the reader a stronger aversion to war than an outright repugnance would have. Billy's ignominious war experience and illusory extra-terrestrial encounter leaves the reader with an overwhelming influx of information from which he or she has the opportunity to withdraw any of many possible interpretations of war and life thereafter.   These interpretations, as well as the one to five star ratings, depend on the amount and quality of erudition possessed by the reader. For myself, Slaughterhouse earns four stars. As a fairly intelligent and advanced high school student, I can appreciate Vonnegut's literary creativity in writing style in plot, but some of his finer and more profound statements on war and life that everyone raves about go right over my head, even though I know it's there somewhere! For a truly scholarly adult or college student, Slaughterhouse probably holds one more star for greater meaning and clarity. A less intelligent or perceptive adult or student may only award three stars. Yet I refuse to believe that even the dullest intellect could award less than that. Vonnegut's most obvious statements are delivered with inescapable hilarity and wit, even if the more subtle hints between the lines are almost evanescent. There will be a moment for every and any reader, no matter the intellect or age, between finishing the book and reflecting on its meanings, when all that resounds in their minds is all they really need to take from Slaughterhouse Five: the unique feeling that accompanies the completion of any great work of art: \\"po-tee-weet?\\"
1573226521|3.0|Alex Garland's 1996 novel THE BEACH unfolds among backpackers in Southeast Asia. As the novel opens, Richard, a young Briton, has checked into a guesthouse in Thailand. Through the night, he is kept awake by a guest in the next room, a manic Scotsman who speaks of a mysterious beach. The next morning, Richard finds that the Scotsman has slit his wrists, but not before drawing a map to the island where this beach may be found. In the company of French couple, Richard heads off to this island, which turns out to be an off-limits part of a national park. The trio thinks up a way to cross the sea to get to it, and they find there a small band of travelers living a seemingly idyllic existence far from the over-touristed spots nearby. This island, however, holds dangers, from the Thai gangsters secretly growing dope on the other side to the dark cabins underneath it. But as THE BEACH reaches its climax, it is revealed that the backpackers' worst enemy is themselves. Their paradise falls apart in an orgy of violence that outdoes William Golding's THE LORD OF THE FLIES in gruesomeness.<br /><br />I travel as lifestyle, and I was very sympathetic to Garland's description of the angst that grips travelers as they see locales going from exclusive to touristy in just a couple of years. But the book has a few flaws that are irksome. Alternating with a description of life on the beach, there is a parallel plot where Richard struggles with the ghost of the dead Scotsman. This eventually takes on resonances of the Vietnam War, which seem very badly integrated with the main plot. It's almost like Garland wanted to write two books, one about the beach and the other about how kids of the 1980s were influenced by Vietnam War films like PLATOON and APOCALYPSE NOW. Alex Garland's writing is also of the airport paperback variety, and has no claim to being serious literature.<br /><br />Still, THE BEACH is pretty entertaining as straight up adventure, especially if you've been in these sort of places. And you can get through its 400+ pages in just a few hours (so it may well be a good airplane read).you can get through its 400+ pages in just a few hours (so it may well be a good airplane read).
0765350386|5.0|Mistborn: The Final Empire is, to put it simply, the best fantasy novel I've read in years. The story of a dismal world in which the prophesied hero was defeated and the people subjugated by a dark lord for centuries, it tells the tale of the newest revolution against the oppressive and greatly feared Lord Ruler by the lowly skaa.<br /><br />Sanderson did a marvelous job of creating a unique and interesting world, with an especially promising new system of magic powered by metal - this was particularly inventive and superbly utilized. The reader is drawn into the setting by the masterful descriptions and excellent narrative voice woven into the story by the author. The action sequences occur infrequently enough to keep from being overwhelming, but also often enough to add an excellent feeling of tension and danger. Not only are they well-paced, they're expressed in such a clear way as to evoke a vivid picture in the mind of what is happening.<br /><br />The characters were both realistically complex and easy to relate to, with well-developed personalities and believable emotions. As the plot develops the reader plumbs their depths and they become more and more real. Interactions are alternately tense, tender, and revealing, all coming together to form a strong web of human connections the likes of which any author would aspire to create.<br /><br />In the end, there is suitable closure but a definite opening for the next two books in the trilogy. One could almost read this as a stand-alone novel, though after becoming so invested in the characters and the story I can't see why anyone wouldn't want to keep reading.<br /><br />Mistborn: The Final Empire is highly thoughtful, meticulously crafted, and an extremely enjoyable read. I would recommend it not merely to fantasy lovers, but to readers new to the genre who deserve a good first impression.
B001PPLIEG|1.0|Without doubt the worst Bond film of all time. ASTONISHINGLY bad.   Unbelievable action sequences - LITERALLY \\"unbelievable\\", with a twisted plot that defies explanation.  Please do not waste your money on this. If you feel that you MUST see it, get it on Netflix or something so that you won't have wasted your money as well as your time.

I was hoping it would go to my son for his birthday March 19th, but after more than two weeks, Amazon.com was unable to provide it (after giving me the impression they would) and provided me with another source which waisted three more weeks of enjoying the product and at the end without any replies to my inquiries used the lame excuse that the post office must have lost it!! I am not happy at all with the service on this product.. I plan to visit my son this week and hopefully we can find a copy from another source and fulfill his birthday wish.

B0017I1IZA|5.0|Evanovich stays true to her characters and I have to disagree with a previous reviewer.  By continuing with the cars blowing up, grandma getting into mischief, etc. it adds to the fun.  I think the Ranger resolution was the only one that stayed true to the Stephanie we,ve all come to know and love.  This book was a fun read!

B001MEJY8W|1.0|I'll keep this brief. \\"Martyrs\\" is ninety minutes of torture porn and five minutes of milky special effects representing \\"the afterlife\\" and some horses**t justification. It concerns a group of people who torture young girls to the point of death so they can try to see what's on the other side. One girl does make it, after they skin her alive, to tell the old biddy behind it about the special effects, only to have said biddy kill herself for no apparent reason but to provide a \\"twist\\" ending. I'm not adverse to strong movies - I highly rate \\"Salo\\" and \\"Irreversible\\", but it's nice if they have some genuine thought behind them. The only horror behind this movie is that it's stolen ninety-five minutes of my life I'll never get back.

B001MEJY8W|3.0|I saw this at the store and I nearly bought it on impulse.  Instead, I read the reviews here first.  That made me want it even more.  But now that I've seen it, I cannot consider it a messed-up clasic like Ichi or Irreversible.  I give the director credit for trying, but he overreached.<br /><br />The first part, the main story arc, was very good.  Also, I was surprised by the . . . departure . . . of one of the main characters only an hour into the movie.  And I liked the direction the movie went in after that.<br />(Sorry I'm being vague, but I don't want to spoil anything.)<br /><br />However, the whole 'Martyr' aspect- the motivations, the reasons behind it all- it seemed like a stretch.  The metaphysical aspect was jarringly unnecessary.  Plus, it ground the movie to a halt.<br /><br />Finally, it all would've been redeemable if only the final make-up effects looked a little more realistic.  Sorry, but the rubber suit . . . that completely shattered the illusion for me.
0141035099|3.0|Alex Garland's 1996 novel THE BEACH unfolds among backpackers in Southeast Asia. As the novel opens, Richard, a young Briton, has checked into a guesthouse in Thailand. Through the night, he is kept awake by a guest in the next room, a manic Scotsman who speaks of a mysterious beach. The next morning, Richard finds that the Scotsman has slit his wrists, but not before drawing a map to the island where this beach may be found. In the company of French couple, Richard heads off to this island, which turns out to be an off-limits part of a national park. The trio thinks up a way to cross the sea to get to it, and they find there a small band of travelers living a seemingly idyllic existence far from the over-touristed spots nearby. This island, however, holds dangers, from the Thai gangsters secretly growing dope on the other side to the dark cabins underneath it. But as THE BEACH reaches its climax, it is revealed that the backpackers' worst enemy is themselves. Their paradise falls apart in an orgy of violence that outdoes William Golding's THE LORD OF THE FLIES in gruesomeness.<br /><br />I travel as lifestyle, and I was very sympathetic to Garland's description of the angst that grips travelers as they see locales going from exclusive to touristy in just a couple of years. But the book has a few flaws that are irksome. Alternating with a description of life on the beach, there is a parallel plot where Richard struggles with the ghost of the dead Scotsman. This eventually takes on resonances of the Vietnam War, which seem very badly integrated with the main plot. It's almost like Garland wanted to write two books, one about the beach and the other about how kids of the 1980s were influenced by Vietnam War films like PLATOON and APOCALYPSE NOW. Alex Garland's writing is also of the airport paperback variety, and has no claim to being serious literature.<br /><br />Still, THE BEACH is pretty entertaining as straight up adventure, especially if you've been in these sort of places. And you can get through its 400+ pages in just a few hours (so it may well be a good airplane read).you can get through its 400+ pages in just a few hours (so it may well be a good airplane read).

1439138311|5.0|If there were a class entitled \\"How to Bring Characters to Life,\\" this would have to be the textbook.  By book's end, the reader has been made privy to the transformation of its main character, Eilis Lacey, from the shy, innocent Irish immigrant to a young woman whose inner strength, we are sure, will lead her through the complexities of living a life torn between two worlds.    But the wonder of this man's writing is how, in so few words, we also come to know, so well, the other inhabitants of this book -- not just those who play the most important roles in Eilis's life, but those who exist in the periphery of her world -- the shop girls, boarders, priests, teachers -- from characters with whom she comes in close contact to those she merely brushes against.  Case in point: Tony's little brother, Frankie, whose feistiness and frustrations in being the youngest of four Italian brothers will grab every reader's heart.    I can only hope this becomes Volume I of \\"the rest of the story.\\"
3836504715|5.0|Score another beautifully done coffee table book of photography to Taschen's publishing reputation. Atget was not only one of the pioneers of street photography he may have been the first full-time practitioner of that art? If not the first, he was certainly one of the best and he devoted his entire life to that career. It was amazing he could make a living at it, but then again he had given up both his acting and painting careers, so it may have seemed more lucrative than either of those professions.<br /> \\"Born in 1857 the son of a Libourne carriage-builder, he lived for over three decades in the great metropolis of Paris, where he constantly explored the city's historic streets and squares, made contact with numerous potential buyers, and gave evening lectures in adult education centers.\\" His original plan was to sell individual photographs of scenes and nudes to artists in order to save them the costs of traveling to the location or paying for models. He had a great many commissions and contracts to document the historic architecture of \\"Old Paris.\\" His normal shooting gear included 20 kilos of equipment including a heavy-duty tripod, wooden camera and a supply of 18 X 24 cm glass negatives. He spent his entire adult life dragging this heavy burden around all of Paris and its suburbs. It was amazing he had any energy left to take his photos.<br />\\"From 1902, onwards, his visiting cards and letterheads proudly read `E. Atget, Author and Publisher of a Photographic Collection of Old Paris.'\\" By this time he had become a successful and much in demand photographer.<br /> Around 1909 the Paris photographer grew tired of working on a commission basis and started publishing his work in the form of albums of prints and post cards. The subjects of the albums tended to focus on particular subjects such as \\"Vehicles of Paris\\" which was devoted to the pre-automobile means of transport used by Partisans. As the son of carriage maker, Atget had a particular affinity for these horse drawn means of transport and those pictures are some of this reviewer's favorite examples of the photographer's work. He concentrated on the old and carefully avoided the new and trendy. Photographer friend and promoter of Atget's work, Berenice Abbott who eventually purchased most of Atget's negatives and prints from his estate, counted 121 different albums of his work in 1927. Samples from these different albums and motifs are used to separate the different types of photographs reproduced in this collection. Two of my favorite sections in addition to the \\"Vehicles of Paris\\" are the so-called \\"bizarre series, such as portraits of prostitutes (1921), or shots of merry-go-rounds. Added to this, he made a new edition his of his photographs of shop-windows.\\" The shop window displays look very much like the products of today and include styles of clothing that are once again coming into vogue. A neighbor of Atget, Man Ray, was one of the first photographers to take notice of Atget's work and began collecting and publishing it as well as recommending it to other artists, collectors and publishers. May Ray also shared Atget's interest in clothing mannequins, but while Atget considered all his work mere documentation of the world he lived in, Man Ray was more interested in making his photography something more. Berenice Abbott was one of May Ray's darkroom assistants and she may have introduced Ray to Atget or vice-versa since Man Ray was his neighbor?<br />  I don't want to end this short review without also mentioning the collections of Street Fairs and the many portraits of \\"Salesmen and Traders on the Streets of Paris.\\" Both chapters contain many memorable images including one of my favorites entitled 'Model-Boat hirer.\\" That picture brings back many happy memories of my own childhood in St. Louis where I used to sail one of my grandfather's antique model boats on the lake behind the St. Louis Art Museum.<br /> Little about Atget's personal life is known, but this volume does include an excellent year-by-year illustrated biography of what is known about his background. This is one of the more important collections of photographic history that has been published by Taschen Publishing. The book contains separate translations of the text in English, French and German. This is another nice book for the serious collectors of photography or fans of \\"Old Paris.\\"es include an excellent year-by-year illustrated biography of what is known about his background.

B000002J03|5.0|From the opening chords of Whole Lotta Love on Led Zeppelin's second album, one can sense the arrival of a monster riff that defined rock there and then. And then, still, people heard that middle part where Jimmy Page's theremin sounds and Robert Plant's orgasmic delivery left everyone gobsmacked just to be followed by a thunderous drum roll which welcomed one of the greatest guitar solos ever!!!     It was 1969 and the world of recorded music was still young, the beginning of the seventies was looming around the corner and loads of stuff had to change - rock music being one of them. And this was when it did.    By blending various influences, Led Zeppelin II is also blessed with the beauty of Thank You, the blues of The Lemon Song and Bring It On Home, the tales of old of Ramble On, the sheer hard rocking of Heartbreaker, the light and shade of What Is And What Should Never Be and John Bonham's mammoth delivery on Moby Dick. Also, not to be forgotten is John Paul Jones's incredible input: his bass playing is an irreplaceable contribution on all songs.    The massive surprise this album brought must've been extreme. Nothing like that had ever come out, and the chemistry these four truly gifted musicians had playing together is still unmatched today - 40 years after its release.
0307408833|4.0|I live in Brooklyn and am a huge fan of Babycakes bakery-- I've loved everything I've tried there, and I was ecstatic to buy the cookbook.  So far, I've baked the banana bread (which was amazing-- no one knew it was gluten-free), the apple-cinnamon toastie, the vanilla cupcakes, and the cornbread.  While the cooking times were a bit off (I have a thermometer inside my oven, and usually end up baking the breads at a higher temp and for a longer time), the end results were very tasty.    However, the one major disappointment of the cookbook for me was the frosting.  I've made both the chocolate and the vanilla several times, and neither recipe yielded an edible result.  Both taste ok, but mostly they just taste like coconut oil-- and the texture is totally off.  I heated all the ingredients (so that the coconut oil didn't bead up) and used a hand-mixer (since the food processor didn't seem to work)before refrigerating.  The ingredients listed on the Babycakes website for their vanilla frosting in no way resemble those in the cookbook's recipe. Many of the other recipes require a good frosting, and so I was very disappointing not to get the \\"real\\" Babycakes frosting recipe with the cookbook.    All in all, there are some disappointments with the cookbook, but I will definitely make many of the recipes again.  It's worth buying if you want truly delicious vegan and gluten-free baked goods.      Oh, and one note about the \\"health\\" factor-- coconut oil and agave nectar are infinitely healthier than butter and sugar.  Some people seemed perplexed as to how baked goods with fat can be \\"healthy\\"-- but coconut oil has a number of healthful properties, and agave won't spike blood sugar levels like sugar will.

0375704027|5.0|Norwegian Wood is about a man remembering a period of his life in the late 1960s. Lots of post-adolescent angst and random sex and how the suicide of a mutual friend affected two friends. They separate, meet up, hook up, separate and meet up again. Both are searching for meaning and a way to heal, but in different ways.<br />Japanese writers and movie directors often see the world so differently than Americans or Europeans. Sometimes the difference view itself is enough for Western critics to lavish praise, sometimes unduly - actor/director Kitano Takeshi's directorial efforts are vastly overrated here - but sometimes the different perspective combines with huge talent to produce exceptional results. Haruki Murakami produces such art.\\"

1439138311|3.0|Brooklyn is the fifth of Colm Toibin's books I've read (after The Heather Blazing, The Blackwater Lightship, The Master, and Mothers and Sons), and the first in which I've been disappointed.  The story of a young Irish woman who emigrates to Brooklyn in the 1950's is potentially very interesting -- and Toibin has certainly done his research about that time and place -- but, in my view, the story doesn't realize its potential for two reasons.    First, the book is written in a very flat, almost affectless style. (An earlier Amazon reviewer said it reads as if it were written for 12-year-olds, and I think there's a lot of truth to that.) Having read several of Toibin's other books, I know that he can write in a more sophisticated style if he wants to, so I have to assume he made a deliberate choice to write Brooklyn in this style. However, I'm at a loss to figure out why he chose to do so.  In any event, the choice didn't work for me.    My second complaint is about the main character, Eilis Lacey, who is so frustratingly passive that she never makes a decision for herself, but allows all her choices to be made by other (mostly male) characters.  (Spoiler alert:  don't read beyond this point if you want to know absolutely nothing about what happens in the book, but I don't think what I'm going to say will come as a surprise to anyone who's read the first ten pages.)  I'm sure it's reasonable to suppose that a well-brought-up young Irish woman in the 1950's who has never thought about emigrating would move to America just because a priest tells her to do so. And it's probably a safe bet that the same young woman, having met a nice young man who wants to marry her, would more or less drift into the assumption that her future life will consist of marrying the young man and having his children. But just because it's realistic doesn't mean I have to find it interesting or enjoyable to spend 262 pages in the company of that young woman.    I found the character of Eilis's sister, Rose, who stays behind in Ireland, to be much more interesting, and would have liked to know more about her inner life.  As far as I'm concerned, Toibin wrote his novel about the wrong sister.

It was a very easy read but its suppose to be a fun read not a challenging one. I had been raving to my friends about how great it was and how they had to read it too and then I saw they were making a movie out of it and was so excited. I was very disappointed in the movie. The book was a million times better. The characters in the movie were perfect portrails of how I had pictured them, just a lot of things in the book weren't told out in the movie, and a lot of it was the stuff that made the book so great. This is one book I borrowed from the library and then bought because I loved it so much and wanted it on hand.<br /><br />I rate this book as by far the best story I've ever read so if you like chick-lit books, you will love this!!!
0345495004|4.0|Almost everyone is familiar with the name Frank Lloyd Wright, the famous American architect. Few are familiar with the name Mamah Cheney. Frank and Mamah started an extra-martial affair after Frank was commissioned to build a house for Mamah Cheney and her husband, Edwin. Mamah has long been remembered as a home wrecker. Frank and Mrs Cheney carried on an affair and then dually abandoned their families and ran off to Europe together. Sounds pretty black and white to me, however, Loving Frank attempts to retell the story through the eyes of Mamah Cheney.    I seldom enjoy books about adultery, but Nancy Horan did an exceptional job considering the scant information available on Mrs Cheney. She somehow recreated conversations that probably took place, feelings that must have been felt, and thoughts that probably haunted both Frank and Mamah. Loving Frank introduces a very modern woman who is desperately trying to discover her true identity, regardless of the price she and everyone she loves must pay.     Although the story is told from Mamah's point of view, Mamah is depicted as a very flawed woman. She loves her children, but somehow convinces herself that they are better off without her. Being a mother just isn't enough, not anymore. She yearns for something beyond what her husband, children, and friends can provide. When she meets Frank, they each believe one is the answer to the other's prayers. Soon enough, however, Mamah begins finding flaws in Frank as well.     I felt the book dragged a bit towards the end. It's not exactly a five star book, but it attempts to tell a different side of a story that has long been written in stone. Controversial subject matter. Horrific and tragic ending. Pretty good book.
B001TOD92C|5.0|As a \\"manly man\\" this is one of the few films that makes the eyes water.  This is one of those films that if  you don't tear up, you're simply not human.  This is up there with \\"Rudy\\" or \\"Crash\\" (where you think the little girl got shot) that evokes the deepest emotions fundamental to the human struggle.     Simply said, this film is great in all of it's aspects.  Aronofsky brings his directing style to this great story and uses his typical quick, contrasting cuts.  He juxtaposes contrasting scenes jolting the watcher into not only seeing the differences, but also the similarities and the ongoing themes that run strong throughout the movie.

B000VNMMR0|4.0|I am a sucker for a good action movie, and the DieHard series is the standard from which all other action movies are judged.  The latest, Live Free or Die Hard, had me nervous.  Recently their has been a ressurection of these old movie dynasties(Indiana Jones, X-files,etc..) and I haven't been to impressed with them,  But<br /><br />This DieHard renewed my hope.  This movie is GREAT!  It's non-stop action that left me rivoted the entire movie.  I loved Bruce Willis in this movie.  He seemed to put on the role of Mclane like someone would put on a comfortable pair of old shoes.  He just wears it well.  The supporting cast was excellent.  Mary Elizabeth Windstead played the daughter and could almost spawn off her own set of sequels.  She acts just like her dad.(she played the bad guy in SkyHigh, a great family flick), the side-kick in this movie is Justin Long, and he plays the role to perfection.<br /><br />Overall a great movie!! I intentionally bought the unrated version, because when I saw that the theatrical version was pg-13, I was certainly disappointed, but the unrated is just as DieHard should be: Irreverant, action packed, and INTENSE.<br /><br />In my opinion this movie falls just behind the first in the series in greatness.<br /><br />As long as their this good, keep making more!
B0018RBN8C|5.0|I always had a rule in my early album purchasing days that I would not buy an album for one song, no matter how great that song was.  And that rule never failed me - if I gave in to the total awesomeness of one song and figured the rest of the album just HAD to be good, I was disappointed nearly every time. This entire album is very, very strong. Each song can stand on its own, and in fact several have garnered significant airplay.  Duffy has captured and updated a sound not heard since the heyday of Motown. It takes you back but doesn't sacrifice freshness to do so. The energy, the hooks, the arragements and the execution are just superb.  You can't go wrong with this one.

B00151QYSU|5.0|Adam Sandler does a great job in this DVD movie about a father and husband who consistently puts his career over his family, thinking all the time that it was in his family's best interest.<br /><br />The story is about a mysterious universal remote given to him that helps him fast forward or rewind various aspects of life.  At first this was helpful and convenient for him, but all too soon, the remote programming begins to take on a life of it's own, from what he originally programmed it to do.<br /><br />The story is a modern take of scrooge in many ways reminding me of that theme.  In today's modern culture, it is thought provoking about work and life balance.  Highly recommend it.
0385339585|2.0|I think I have read all of Grisham's books, except maybe one or two. This is not his worst book (The Broker that is for that matter), but is a good second worst.    The start of the book, say the first 100 pages are grasping. An interesting plot which could develop in a very interesting story, heirs which dislike each other as much as they disliked the old Troy Phelan.    Unfortunately execution of testament requires that an illegitimate child of Phelan has to be found somewhere in the Amazon rain forests, and more unfortunate is that Grisham takes the reader with him on this trip down to Corumbá, and then by boat further into the jungle.    Then the story becomes a book like there are thirteen in a dozen, an old flat bottomed river boat, rain, heat, crocodiles, snakes, boredom, indians, tribes, the lone trade post, engine trouble, humidity, diseases, once you read a story like this you read them all.    The main character Nate O'Riley is travelling to Brazil and spends about two weeks in the jungle finding this heir, and the reader is with O'Riley all those two weeks, from hour to hour not a single moment skipped. This goes on for tens and tens of pages from one rain storm to the next, from one boring meal of rice with beans and boiled chicken to the next, from one indian tribe to the next. They are getting lost with the small craft and then they find their way back, they have engine trouble and that is solved, and eventually the jungle trip takes over threehundred  pages of the book. While it all could have been summarized in half a page: Nate O'Riley went down to find Rachel and he found her or he did not find her.    That is all very nice, but it is displaced in Grisham's book. One expects law offices, court rooms, fighting families, but not half a book filled with travel adventures in the Brazilian swamps. That should be left to National Geographic or a travel report of the World Missionaries.    Two stars instead of one because for the plot and the setup, andeven the ending, although many readers might disagree with that.

B001GCUNYO|4.0|Liam Neeson as \\"Bryan Mills,\\" reminded me of Denzel Washington's role in \\"Man On Fire.\\"  In that film, Washington played a relentless-and-brutal bodyguard who did what he had to do to get kidnapped Dakota Fanning back to her parents.  Here, Neeson does the same to get his daughter \\"Kim\\" back from kidnappers/sex trade slimeballs.  An ex-professional killer in retirement, \\"Bryan\\" travels to Paris and shows the bad guys who they're messing with!  Neeson is very good in here.    Yeah, it's a little far-fetched but it's a fun hour-and-a-half that's guaranteed to entertain and a no-nonsense, shoot-first film that always satisfies. It also looks good on Blu-Ray. Beware though: this is another \\"shaky\\" hand-held camera deal on the action scenes, which can be tough on your eyes at times.      One last thing: it's not \\"non-stop action\\" as some have said. This movie starts slowly and builds up. It's the last half hour that's non-stop violence, not the whole film.
B001NFNFIK|4.0|Most reviews we've seen for \\"In The Electric Mist\\" by professional \\"Film Critics\\" are way off! It is really a good flick; both my husband and I absolutely loved it. Great plot with just the right combo of suspense and weirdness; a fine all around experience. And, Louisiana's characters and many charms ooze throughout the plot in a mesmerizing fashion fueled by a stellar soundtrack.  Never heard of the film when we netflixed it; but subsequently ordered our own copy! Can't believe it hadn't been promoted, especially after seeing some of the absolute schlock that is foisted on us! Hadn't heard of the book it was based on either, just saw the title and thought it sounded interesting. Now we're Robicheaux fans and even have books to prove it.<br />Tommy Lee Jones is always a pleaser, and Levon Helm as Hood was truly some inspired casting.  And when they get to putting out a soundtrack, or at least a compilation CD of music that was used, we're in line! If there isn't one out there already, someone ought to jump on it because it would sell.

0756405890|1.0|Where to begin with this shlockfest of contrived trite cliches? Probably should say I met the author once when he was shleping his book. My wife turned to me and whispered, Hate to be in the room with him and his ego. Her comments confirmed my own first impression and this feeling only deepened as I listened to him yammer on. I'm glad others have pointed out that he comes off as an enormous narcissistic egomaniac. That's exactly the vibe both my wife and I got.    The book itself is a total disaster so where to begin? It seems like many debut novelists there's a wealth of \\"oh my isn't this so wonderful\\" reviews written by the author, his friends and family. I'm sure friends and family meant well, but there are so freaking many of them its way too much especially for what reads like an ninth grader's first draft, with little exception.    The tacked on interlude sequences are the most egregious flaws in the book. Did the author really think no one would notice these were cut in after the book itself was completed? It's almost as if some editor told the author his book was a walking disaster beyond repair and he had to come up with a way to repackage it or rewrite it from scratch.    So the \\"repackaging.\\" How do you sell an utterly simplistic story about absolutely nothing written in the barest of pens? Ah, you tack on interlude sequences that sell the dry first person narrative as coming from someone else. Problem is these interspersed sequences are as dry and lifeless as Kvothe's story. The opening sequence, written in third person narrative, is the worst of them. Rothfuss simply doesn't know how to write a descriptive passage. The entire book comes off as a dry, lifeless travelog. Examples a plenty:    No, wait. There was no church yet, and no priests either. Just men and women, and some of them knew who Tehlu was. But after years of watching and waiting, Tehlu saw a woman of pure heart and spirit. Her name was Perial. Her mother had raised her to know Tehlu, and she worshipped him. *** \\"Such wonderfully descriptive prose,\\" said the shills, \\"Such a wonder to behold!\\" (For the very dense, this is sarcasm.)    I was rather disappointed. At least as disappointed as I could be in the Heart of Stone. I lifted the coin in my hand, and the coin on the table lifted itself in a similar fashion. It was magic, there was no doubt about that. But I felt rather underwhelmed. *** Um, me too, completely, utterly underwhelmed. Is this shlockfest over yet?    At least one of the courtyards had been completely isolated and could only be accessed though (sic) a window. Rumor had it that there were some rooms bricked off entirely, some with students still inside. My first class was held in Mains. Luckily, I had been warned by my bunkmate that Mains was difficult to navigate. *** \\"Oh pure brilliance here,\\" shouted the shills, \\"Pure brilliance.\\" (For the very dense, this is sarcasm again.)    I smiled. \\"What did you bring me?\\" I teased gently. She smiled and thrust her hand forward. Something gleamed in the moonlight. \\"A key,\\" she said proudly, pressing it on me. *** OMG only two hundred or so pages of this mindnumbing, soulsucking book left to read. (For the very dense, this is sarcasm again.)    At the end, after about 600 pages of shlock and I'm sure with an editor's reminding, the author must have been reminded to add a few more pages in the inn. So the author tosses those in as he tosses in a closing sequence where the story gets interrupted. This is followed by a length of lifeless third person narrative before getting back to the lifeless end of the first person story.    Skipping over the plotting (which there isn't much of as I suppose the interludes were meant to mesmorize you) and moving on to characterization. You just have to shake your head as you go. There's only one real character, Kvothe, and he comes off like the title of Chapter 61. His obsession with money clearly comes from the author but let's hope the author isn't as dull andtedious as Kvothe.    By the end, you know for certain the first person story is a cover for the author's inability to write anything with clarity and depth. I mean the bulk of the story is a first person telling therefore at no point is there a need to bother with description. Right? Wrong! There are plenty of exceptionally well done first person narratives. Perhaps the author should have read a few of them before churning out this dreadful mess.

But it all changes when he goes on a field trip to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in Manhattan, he discovers the shocking truth about his father and the mythological world is it all real? I would recommend this book to sixth graders and up because you might want to get a sense of mythology first before reading this book or you'll end up with to many question =).<br />  I would rate this book and all the sequels to this book a seventy out of ten. I rated this book a ten out of ten because I can relate to Percy, I knew my father but I never really developed a relation ship with him, also this book got me to reading a little bit more than I usually do. Because it was so adventurous and I really wanted to see what would happen next in the story whether he or his friends get into some sort of trouble that may involve a gods' weapon. \\"it may\\" =O.<br /><br />-MAC

0743437497|5.0|The Shining. It's a scary, suspenseful book by Stephen King. This is probably the best book I have ever read. It is about an ordinary family of a mother, (Wendy) father, (Jack) and son, (Danny). Jack gets a job as the winter caretaker of the Overlook Hotel. At this hotel, there has been a lot of murders and when there are murders, a little bit of that leaves a trace of itself. When they move into the Overlook Hotel, Jack starts feeling possessed. This book is also about the family's will to survive in this awful hotel. I rated this book 5 stars because you will never want to put it down and you will want to read even more Stephen King books. This book never has a boring page.<br />I think that the characters in the book are played out really well. Stephen King shows how the characters change very descriptively and well. Stephen King is a very good author and you should really try out his books, especially The Shining. I recommend this book to everyone except people who get scared very easily. I think whoever reads this book and they would love it.<br /><br />-ZMC

B0026IBX1Y|5.0|When was the last time that you where told a life lesson? Well I know that it has been a long time. So you have to read the book Tuesdays with Morrie by Mitch Albom. It is about a professor who taught Mitch as a college student. But later in the professors life he is diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease. I would give this book five stars because I thought that Mitch made it so that you where really there. The genre of the book is a autobiography and I recommend it for anyone above the age of ten because it is a little hard to understand and can get sad.<br /><br />  The book is titled Tuesdays with Morrie because when Mitch found out that Morrie (professor) was diagnosed with the disease he would meet with him every Tuesday. I really like the characters in the book because they are very interesting characters. Morrie is just full out full of wisdom. But Mitch has a whole lot of room in his brain to take in that wisdom. That is why I rated this book a five star and I think you will too.<br /><br />-BJE
015206396X|3.0|This was ok.. I don't normally ever read young adult novels but this one caught my attention, being about a young girl in medieval days that has a \\"talent\\" for killing people.  Her name is Katsa and she lives with her uncle who is a king and a bully.  He forces her to be his \\"thug\\" and hurt, kill, or maim people that cross him.  Katsa has a conscience tho and when a young prince named Po enters her life and seeks her help for saving his kidnapped grandfather and his cousin, she finds the courage to speak up to her king uncle.  Her and Po go on a quest and become lovers.  This is where it becomes a young adult novel.  The sex is written so that you know it happens but there is no detail about the act at all.  It is mostly Katsa contemplating it and mulling over it and making the decision.  This is probably where young adults will have the questions.  Parents should know it is pre marital relations if they are concerned about that.  To sum it up, using \\"matrix\\" like skills with bows and arrows and flying daggers and karate moves, Katsa and Po rescue his cousin from an evil king and everybody lives happily ever after.  In a way, the story was childish, but the writing was good and I found it entertaining enough for adults as well as teenagers. My number one complaint: lack of character descriptions.

The hero of the day will not be the gods themselves though it will be their sons and daughters. The battle of the labyrinth a stunning and amazing story for men and women of all ages. This amazing story is about the life of a 15 year old boy by the name of Percy Jackson. If you're unaware the boy is a half blood which is also is considered demigod if you don't know what a demigod is it is half human and half a god. You'll immediately fall in love with this book but it is worthless if you don't read the whole series. When I read just the first book in a couple of minutes I fell in love with it I couldn't resist reading the rest of the series. You should definitely get the newly released book in the series \\"The last Olympian\\". This book deserves a 5 out of 5.  S.C.
0385751893|5.0|John Boyne's novel, \\"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas \\" is outstanding. It is beautifully written with a most powerful storyline. However, the book is labeled \\"young adult\\" and I believe this to be very misleading. First, many adults who do not read young adult literature, might be put off by the category. More important, although this story is allegorical in nature, it is certainly powerful and frequently disturbing, as any book about the Holocaust would be. \\"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas\\" themes are the nature of evil, the nature of man, and the beauty of the human spirit. The author is explicit in his writing, although there is no overt violence or questionable language. However, there were moments when I had to stop reading because I felt actual pain. And the more I got to know the characters of the 2 boys, Bruno and Shmuel, the more emotional I became. The book is meant to educate young adults about the Holocaust. I believe that the manner in which the content is depicted, although done with great sensitivity and compassion, is too harsh for a young person - a \\"tween \\"- to read. I think it more appropriate for someone in high school or college. I am Jewish, and a mother, and I feel that it is so important to educate all people, especially our youth, about this most heinous event. But I prefer to do so by introducing books, like \\"The Diary of Anne Frank,\\" before exposing children to a disturbing drama like this one. If you disagree with me, I would suggest that you discuss this book with your child before and after reading. It would make for a good discussion on WWII, the Holocaust and morality and evil.<br /><br />Nine year-old Bruno is an innocent, carefree boy growing up in Berlin during WWII. He has three \\"Best Friends For Life,\\" and wants to be an explorer when he grows up. Bruno lives in a beautiful mansion, complete with gardens and servants, along with his older sister Gretel, their lovely mother, and their father, a high ranking SS officer. The boy comes home one day after school, in 1943, and finds Maria, the family maid, packing his belongings into wooden crates, including things he had hidden and were \\"nobody's business.\\" He learns that his family is moving away from Berlin and he must go with them, leaving behind his school, best friends and beloved grandparents.<br /><br />Following a formal dinner that the \\"Fury\\" attends, Bruno parents explain the reason for the move. His father has received a huge promotion to \\"Commandant.\\" They are going to live in a place called \\"Out-With,\\" (Auschwitz), in Poland and will remain there for the \\"foreseeable future.\\"<br /><br />The house is a cold and somber place, located in a desolate countryside. Bruno hates his new home and misses his friends. He feels terribly isolated and bored. There are no boys to make friends with here and he wants to return to Berlin. From one side window in the house, he can see a high-wired compound inhabited by sad-looking people in striped pajamas. He wonders what these people do all day and why, in fact, they wear pajamas in the daytime. He wants to go and play with the boys he sees there. When he asks his father who \\"those people\\" are, his Commandant Dad responds that \\"they aren't really people.\\" Lieutenant Kotler, a supercilious young SS officer on his father's staff, constantly ruffles Bruno's hair and calls him \\"little man.\\" Bruno's anger at Kotler's condescension is just a part of the rage and helplessness he feels about his living situation, where he feels like a prisoner.<br /><br />Since there is not much to explore within his own compound, where the family lives, it is inevitable that Bruno would seek excitement elsewhere. Thus, he finds a way to escape his confined quarters and eventually makes his way to the barbed wire enclosure where now he can clearly see the inhabitants within - all wearing gray striped pajamas with gray striped caps on their shaved heads. On one of his excursions, he meets a boy named Shmuel, a broken waif of achild wearing a numbered uniform. Shmuel lives a very different life than Bruno. He is a Jew, and along with his father, a prisoner in the camp. He sometimes hides by the fence, during work detail, where he meets Bruno and the two form a friendship. They even share the same birthday. Shmuel tells Bruno about how his family was transported here from a ghetto in Poland. Bruno talks about his wonderful life in Berlin, and smuggles food from the kitchen to give to Shmuel. But Bruno still doesn't \\"get it.\\" The enormity of the evil confronting him is beyond his comprehension. He believes that the numbered striped pajamas are part of a game played inside the barbed wire enclosure. He asks his friend what is burned in the chimneys.

And, of course, Shmuel, would not have survived the camp long enough to befriend anyone. Most children, who were of no use in the labor force, would have been sent to their death immediately upon arrival at the camp. And, it is beyond me how an intelligent, albeit naive and self-centered child like Bruno, would be calling the Fuehrer, the \\"Fury\\" or be unaware of the war.

B000TU16GS|5.0|If you like books with action and adventure, this is the book for you. This book is about a boy named Alex Rider. It is written by Anthony Horowitz. It is the first of the Alex Rider series. Alex doesn't realize that he is a spy to be until his uncle dies. Alex is then picked up by a spy organization called MI6. He then goes into action. He is sent to go spy on these new computers called stormbreakers. However this computer is much more then a computer. Alex's goal is to see if there is anything wrong with them and contact MI6 before they are released. This book isn't a stupid spy book where they go somewhere and watch someone. Also, this book is my favorite book I have read.<br /><br /> I give this book a 5 out of 5 star rating. I think that the author did a really good job with this book. He did great with imagery and I could really picture what Alex was doing in the book. Right now I am on the 4th book of the series. If you end up liking Stormbreaker I really recommend finishing the series. This is probably my favorite series of books that I have read in a long time.<br /><br />- KH
B00005JM0B|5.0|Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is a very good action packed movie that has a very amazing and yet, frightening ending.    As a follower of the Terminator series, T3 really stands its own ground against T1 and T2.     The acting is good, but the story line is better. I know there were a lot of terminator fans that hated this movie, but i loved it. I saw it 4 times at the movie theater!    The story again revolves around John Connor, only this time, he's not the main target, his leadership is.     Skynet sends back the TX, a woman terminator who is equiped like Inspector Gadget with everything from flame throwers to chainsaws. She also has the power to control other machines, which makes for a great car chase scene in the movie.    Arnold is back, and he has some very funny lines (talk to the hand), but again, as a Terminator fan, the key moment was when he first appears on scene, very reminiscent of the Inidana Jones shadown scene in The Cyrstal Skull.    overall, the movie is excellent, and honestly, you don't have to know or have seen the 1st 2 movies to understand this one.    My favorite part of the movie is the ending. It has a very realistic doomsday feel like in the movie The Day After, with nukes coming out from the ground and blowing the world to Judgement Day in the Terminator movie.    The only thing that really bothered me about T3, is forced comedy (the Victoria's Secret scene, what's the point?) and some poor editing (how in the heck did both the Terminator and TX know to go to the Animal Shelter right away?)    but other than that, good movie. The DVD is excellent and features deleted scenes, features, and even the making of T3 and T3 the video game.    Overall, 5 stars. T3 stands its own ground. good popcorn movie, great ending.
0439813786|5.0|Have you ever imagined living by yourself at age ten, in the walls of one of the busiest train stations in all of France? Well, Hugo Cabret, age ten experienced this all before he was old enough to have minimum wage.<br />Even though he was very young, when his father died in a fire and he went to live with his Uncle Jim who was the time keeper in the train station. One day after Uncle Jim was done with work he went missing for many days. Hugo thought that since his uncle was a drunk he ended up somewhere he was not supposed to be. As a result Hugo decides since his job was so important he needed to continue his uncle's job for him. Having many paychecks pilled up in corners, is what Hugo had, nothing special. Since he was alone, he could not deposit the pay checks because once again, he was too young. When I read this book, I thought that I have a life that I am fortunate for because I do not need to steel food from shops. After I read this book, I though this was the best book I have ever read. I would have to rate this book five stars. I would have to rate it five stars because this book came to life for me.

They fight, no doubt, but their love is never to be doubted. While each of these books are of epic length, I never think, \\"Get on with it already,\\" as I do with other long books. Each of these seems just long enough to leave me ready for the next.
0810993139|5.0|As Greg enters a new school year he wants to leave anything that happened the past three months behind. Especially one incident that happened to him. But with his older brother Rodrick anything can happen. Diary of a Wimpy kid 2 is about a boy named Gregg Heffley and how his brother Rodrick is always the one who always gets away with everything Diary of a Wimpy kid 2 by Jeff Kinney is a great book for, kids, young adults, and even for adults. If I would to rate this book out of 5 stars I would rate it a 5. I would rate it a five because, it's an amazing book to get a laugh out of. This book deserves 5 stars because; I mean having pictures in a book for older people just makes it gold. The genre of this book is fiction.<br /><br />I think that the book is just pure genius. I think that the book is funny as well as all the characters in the book. The story is based on the character Gregg Heffley. Making this book based on a character's own private journal is amazing. I mean usually when you hear journal or diary you think its going to be a girls book. But that's what is good about this book it's not only for girls. It's not only for boys either, this book is made for everyone and everyone can have a great time reading it. Also this book is only one book out of the series. This is the second book of the series. But I think that out of all of the books in the series, it doesn't just end and you read the next book in the series and its going to be about the same topic. Each book has its own way of telling what the book is about. I think that the author did a great job writing this book and the series. I mean just look at the first book of the series, it is one of the New York times best seller. And at this rate who knows what's in it for us the next book Jeff  Kinney writes. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to get a laugh out of reading a book.<br /><br />by EN
B001CTDH4Y|5.0|I purchased this video for my young son for Easter who absolutely adored the movie after watching a rental. He absolutely loves everything about the movie which includes a lot of music and action. He watched the movie non-stop for two weeks after we received it. I would highly recommend this movie for young children.
1595141715|5.0|Have you ever felt like you were the reason that someone did something and you were responsible for it? Well how would you feel if you found out you were part of the reason somebody committed suicide? In the book 13 Reasons Why by Jay Asher, which is in the genre of realistic fiction, that is exactly what happened. Hannah Baker was just an average teenage girl, but soon came to face many troubles and problems with her life. Tons of rumors were spread about her and things they thought she did, even though half of them weren't true. Things in her life were just going in the wrong direction, so she took the easy way out... and killed herself. Before her death, she recorded 7 tapes (with sides A and B), which explained the reasons of why she was committing suicide, and for some reason Clay Jenson is involved, even though he had no clue why. I would give this book 5 star out of 5 because I thought it was very suspenseful and kept you on the edge of your seat throughout the whole book. This book is filled with many exciting surprises that will keep your eyes glued to the book and keep you wondering what will happen next.<br /><br /> I think that the characters were very well planned out. Jay Asher gave you a very vivid description on what the characters were like. From the stories that were revealed about them, you could unearth the type of person that they were, and what personalities they had. The book also gave you very good details to give you a picture of what they might look like and what features they might have. I would recommend this book to anybody over the age of 12, because it can get a little freaky at times. Also, I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to be in suspense and likes to get in the zone and feel what the character feels. Overall, I thought this was a very enjoyable book and hope many more people can experience what I did when I read this book.<br /><br />-S.E.W =]

0451528018|4.0|Warning! Once this book opens, its reader may be unable to set it down. The Hound of the Baskervilles is an irresistible adventure. This thrilling Sherlock Holmes mystery pulls the reader into tracing the steps of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson as they question suspects and discovers clues.  As a teenager, I have enjoyed the short story adventures of Sherlock Holmes, but this full length novel was so much better.  The PACES PAideia Study Guide proved extremely helpful in thoroughly comprehending each aspect of the book.  The Character Chart, located in the Study Guide, enabled me to track the suspects and compile information I gathered on each.  The thought provoking Journal Questions helped me organize my thoughts about the story on paper and keep up with the plot.  The Study Guide's Parent Questions also assisted me in digging deeper into the novel and discussing key points with my parents.  My favorite part about this mysterious tale is that, for the most part, it is unpredictable.  Numerous red herrings arise throughout the story, forcing the reader to decipher the truth.  Even when the verdict is revealed, the reader is left with many questions to ponder.  Thus, the reader ultimately becomes the detective right along with Holmes and Watson.  Again, warning!  Once this book is opened, its reader will be unable to close it until the end.
B00005K3OT|5.0|This is a poetic, visually stunning movie with quite a number of really good feamle roles, fine performed. There is so much poetry and magic, the movie reminded me of Latin American literature very much. The same sense of marriage of the real and the unreal, coexisting in harmony.    A young women, (who is also a single mother),a daugther of an European  man and a Mexican curandera, arrives in a small traditional town in France, during the time of Lent . Not only she dares to open a chocolate shop during this time, but in additon her creations are considered kind of excentric, the same as the decor incorporating artifacts showing clearly Precolumbian heritage.The chocolate store owner breaks routines people had so far, and she is also able to help people hwo have psychological problems, healig human relations. But her otherness is not welcomed at first, people are distrustful, and she is a percived threat to their traditional ways.But they slowly warm up to her.    But there is a problem: the local aristocrat, a count who enjoys to infulence the life in the town, is hostile toward the newcomer, and has a very strong influence on the local Catholic priest.The count is anaware how bad his plotting is, until one day he is faced witt the  results.A sad story about a strong, dominant persoanlity and weak, gulible folowing.But in this conflict, clash of two cultures, one traditional and one alternative, and the opposition bewteen the  creative and the routine, it is the other, the revolutionary is the side which will be victorius. The count is hostile, she just lives her live according to her conscience.And we sympathise with her right away.     This movie is touching deeper societal problems, yet is very entertaining. The main focus is xenophobia, but also the appreacaiton of learnig across the cultures, and the need of positve influeneces of variosu kinds: will be this another culture, or just a different personality, or different kind of thinking.This movie, becasue isso poetic, (but maintains the integrtity of the story), is an ode to an opend mind.A movie a to enjoy and savour, a bitter-sweet one.And Juliette Binoche is wonderful as always.

1401907725|5.0|I am a Christian.  I thought it was against God to use any tool other than scripture and prayer to get what you need to answer life's conundrums.  Then my Methodist Sunday school teacher had us study a book regarding the intuition of children (so not mainstream).<br /><br />These cards, every single time I use them (pray first while holding them), give me precisely, exactly, immediately the explanation of what is going on around me that has my emotions or thoughts misdirected.  I am going through what I considered a tragedy....my Angels have told me whenever I start feeling that way, that this is a \\"blessing in disguise.\\"  No matter what the concern, the 'big picture' will be right there in front of you.<br /><br />This is a very useful way to \\"get\\" what God and His Angels are trying to tell you when you are unable to consciously do so.  Highly recommended. Thank you to Ms. Virtue. DB
B000089CJI|1.0|I picked up this CD when I read an interview with Ben Gibbard mentioning that this CD outsold all the DCFC records combined before \\"Plans\\".  I thought I missed something given that I really like all the DCFC stuff before \\"Plans\\".   I didn't.  This is just electronica dribble and not very interesting, actually blaned would be an improvement.      DCFC continues to soar and can really hit the ball out of the park on some tunes, but honestly \\"Plans\\" which set them on the path to über status is my least favorite DCFC effort.  I don't like it at all and if that along with this Postal Service work is what sells then I hope Ben Gibbard falls flat on his commercial appeal, because that will be one damn record I will enjoy.
0394800389|5.0|This is a super fun book and instantly became my son's favorite.  He is almost 4.  I really like reading it because unlike most children's books, it's interesting to me (mostly because it's tricky to not get my tongue tied).  It's a lot of fun.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is a terrific series, sadly cancelled too soon. A dramatic and, at times, funny adventure through 'the black'.     Adam Baldwin is a particular favorite of mine. His Jayne Cobb is a mercenary with a deceptively good side. Made me laugh every episode. And I have to say it...a man mountain!     All the actors are stellar and I can only hope, like Star Trek, they reunite every few years for another movie.
B001TH16DS|4.0|Let me preface this by saying I am a huge Trek fan, especially that of the Original Series, since the late 60's/early 70's. I've even slagged-through and enjoyed most of the post-TOS ST stuff, even the really bad stuff, LOL! \\"Bad Star Trek is better than NO Star Trek\\" I always say, LOL!    Pros:    1) PQ: The updated PQ is outstanding...ST:TOS has never, ever looked this good before!     2) AQ: The new multi-channel audio is excellent and has been seemlessly blended with the original dialogue.     3) Added/Updated Special Effects: The new digital CGI special effects are good, but take a little time to get used to after decades of mini model photography superimposed over matte paintings have clouded my judgement, LOL!     4) Cool Extra's: Lots and lots of extra's, the new stuff shot in HD vid, are very cool and worth having. The restoration of the episodes, new music recording, etc. are great.    5) Stellar Program Content: Of course the actual program content is stellar...great stories outlining great characters with equally great screenplays and relatively honest acting (hammy over-acting in Shatner's case, LOL!). if you're reading this I'm sure there's nothing new to add here that you don't already know and appreciate.    6) Dual Episode Content: Both original, albeit visually restored, programming content is present side-by-side with the new visually and sonically enhanced versions of the same episode. One can switch between original and enhanced effects via the \\"angle\\" function on any BD player.    Cons:    Price: Relatively high price, although Amazon's current price is not too out of line.     Packaging Quality : Packaging could be better on a set this pricy...the multi-disc holders in the smallish case are crappy and allow the discs to flop around inside the case and the lack of disc content labeling and/or graphics is dissapointing as well.     Glitches: The biggest problem for me is that the these discs, at least on my Pioneer BDP-51 BD player (with latestFW installed), are glitchy. Besides the noticeable volume drop (somewhat ameloirated by switching the audio set-up on the BD menu), the audio completely drops-out during the transition between the new CGI effects shots and the original program content when playing the \\"enhanced\\" episodes. A quick FF scan will restore the audio, but then I have to reverse scan back to the dialogue I missed. If I scan back too far, the audio drops-out again. This happens fairly regularly, depending on the episode and the amount of SE shots it contains. In addition, the aspect ratio of the episode seems to switch itself form WS to FS to 4:3 at will when you use the scan/skip functions. I'm assuming this is a BD player (FirmWare) issue and not that of the discs themselves, but, having said that, I haven't experienced this on any other BD to date. As a new Pioneer FW update is imminent, I hope this will address my issues so that I can fully appreciate and enjoy this otherwise wonderful set.     Conclusion: Overall, I'd have to give the content, PQ/AQ and extra's five stars. The few cons I've experienced bring my rating down to four stars.    Enjoy!    UPDATE: From what I've learned on the AVSForum, apparently it's not my BD Player that's causing the glitches. Errors between \\"branching\\" of new and old shots are causing audio drop-outs in lot's of different players. Apparently, the Blu-ray standard is still being written (or re-written) every day.
1582701709|3.0|The marketing on this book is so blatently not hidden I commend the author. At least the hypocrisy goes only so far. The content has been said in many other books through the century. There is a discrepency in my opinion when they focus on materialism and wealth. There are positives in most all books. The Secret also has some positive aspects, however the fluff and simplicity sugars down the practicality.<br /><br />Too many hurting souls will bury their heart into this book, only to find that getting through life crisis is not as simple as rubbing the cover of this book as a magic lamp.<br /><br />Dan Williams author of \\" Above His Shoulders\\"
B001DJ69E8|5.0|You can hear Immediate's music in trailers, but this CD presents the songs in an uncut format.  Their music has a huge orchestral sound, with an accompanying choir, which makes for an extremely epic and beautiful sound.    This CD is definitely worth purchasing, if you like film scores, video game music, classical, and just good music in general.    The trailer music company behind this release is putting on a concert on June 27, in Santa Monica, California called Trailer Music Live.  They will be playing tracks from this release, live with a full orchestra.    [...]    It's sure to be an awesome experience, because these tracks are so powerful and moving.
B000BO0LKY|1.0|Mariah Carey's Mimi album was so over-rated when it was released in 2005. We Belong Together just sounds like a carbon copy of all her better ballads. I used to be a huge Mariah fan from 1990-1997 - this woman had a killer voice and her songwriting was pretty darn flawless, but then she changed into this hip-hop/r&b knockoff - it was a terrible career move on her part. If you want classic Mariah then check out Music Box or Daydream, now that's a true artist.
0780626494|5.0|This movie never gets old.  The retro 50's is so authentic, I watch with nostalgic amazement.  Wouldn't the world be a nicer place if we could blast everyone with the past?  Everyone that sees it enjoys it.  A must own!
B001AVCFK6|1.0|I just don't see the point of re-booting the series with new versions of the original characters - especially since the original Star Trek TOS is being updated on Blu-Ray now - showing everybody just how good it was.    If they wanted to do something different with ST - why not start with an all new crew.  Then they wouldnt be compared to anybody and they could do what they like with the characters.  If they wanted something from Roddenberry, why not use his original idea for the series [never shot] of the USS Yorktown and Capt Robert April.    An even better idea would be the adventures of the Enterprise under Capt Christopher Pike.  They'd have a younger Spock as the science officer [perfect for a younger actor] and a new  strong female lead in No. 1.    There are just so many good, ORIGINAL ideas they could have gone with - to just totally re-boot and re-do the original [which was brilliant] - is  just such a pointless waste.  3 Thumbs Down!!!
156224003X|5.0|This is a great book, not only for musicians (aspiring or not), but for all people who practice anything. It's a book you will want to have on your shelf for future reference and to allow your friends to borrow.
0380730405|5.0|If you have never read Du Maurier's classic, you must. This book is one of my all time favorite novels and has everything a good novel should have...suspense, mystery, romance and the most colorful characters you will ever find. The first time I read the book, I couldn't put it down. And the second time, the same thing happened...even when I knew the ending!! I can certainly understand why this book propelled Du Maurier to author stardom. It should be on everyone's bucket list of books.
B001KP2J3U|5.0|This is a good adaptation from the book.  After watching \\"Evil under the Sun\\" (1982) and \\"Appointment with Death\\" (1988) you naturally think of Peter Ustinov as Hercule Poirot.  The whole movie is packed with great actors, yet even thought you recognize them they do not distract from the characters that they play.<br /><br />I thought that it was a nice touch when the kids along the shore mooned Mrs. Van Schuyler (Bette Davis) as kids would do everywhere.<br /><br />Simon (Simon MacCorkindale) and his new bride Linnet (Lois Chiles) are being perused by Jacqueline De Bellefort (Mia Farrow) the girl he jilted.  Once onboard a boat going down the Nile bodies are dropping like flies.  Everyone is a suspect.  Everybody could have done it as we see the proof acted out.  And yet nobody could have done it as all alibis hold up.  Only Hercule Poirot can logically figure this out.  Naturally as usual Hercule Poirot is in the right place at the right time to hear everything and extract the truth.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001KZOVJK Evil Under the Sun]]
0316010669|5.0|I have read several of Gladwell's books and this is my favorite. I find his ideas fresh and interesting and I love the way he looks at the world. Mr. Gladwell certainly has many \\"sticky\\" ideas; my husband and I still find ourselves often saying, \\"So what's your blink?\\" Meaning of course, What is your first impression? While we certainly believe the author is onto something when he says first impressions (often without even realizing you are having them) are accurate, there are certainly times when second and third and fourth are well deserved...and Gladwell does acknowledge this. Fun read.
B0009W5K0Y|5.0|Superb debut album by very talented young musicians.  I bought this after buying Riot and I like it as much as Riot.

B0000041DF|5.0|I can only echo what so many other five-star reviewers here have noted. Martha owns both of these concertos, and this disc clearly illustrates why.    To those who complain about some missed notes, it's extremely rare for anyone to play either of these difficult pieces from beginning to end without making mistakes. The great majority of piano concerto recordings - both live and studio - are later \\"corrected\\" in post-production with digital editing. Hats off to Philips for issuing these two performances untouched. It makes them all the more exciting.    Way to go Martha!!
B0013FYTA8|5.0|this whole cd is good. its a cd that is now one of my favorites and will be waiting for next cd from this band.
B002436WJE|5.0|This movie had me hooked from the previews. Then I thought...I wonder if the extended previews pretty much showed the whole movie. But I still decided to see it, plus we had a gift card! :)  Well, it was much better than I expected. It showed what a father would do to search for his daughter. Of course there is action. You gotta expect that, right? But Liam Neeson showed great skill in his craft as an actor. . .and well, as fighting as someone who is supposed to have that kind of skill. Great flick. Fight scenes are not cheesy. If any martial artist saw this movie, they would appreciate the \\"simplicity of complicated techniques\\" when he fights. I don't want to ruin the movie for you. This is just a must see. Don't waste your time renting and just buy it. That's my opinion. Enjoy!
B001GM28HO|5.0|This is one of the best pop/dance CDs to come along in years.  Actually, it's one of the best CDs period to come out recently.  There's been a drought of good new music in the past few years.  This CD is a nice splash of rain to break that drought some.  The songs on here, with few exceptions are catchy.  But not in a bubblegum, airhead way.  There actually is substance and originality to this CD.  Another reviewer called it \\"odd.\\"  That's all right here, cuz the odd testifies to the fact that this CD isn't like a thousand others already made.  It's got its own groove and it's a fun one.
B0001I561E|5.0|Well priced, arrived very quickly, works fine.  Although it's a used copy the condition is superb.  Highly recommended.
0307474275|5.0|This is a page turner that will keep you on the edge of your seat! Just hold on until the end. The suspense is more thrilling than a roller coaster ride.<br /><br />You'll need to have an open mind about some of your religious beliefs. That's okay. None of us truly know what happened two thousand years ago. Perhaps this will provide you with some food for thought. It certainly did for me.<br /><br />While this is not the genre in which I write, it does have an element of spirituality. I appreciate that since I write spiritually-themed books that are designed to make people lighten up and not take life so seriously. My first novel is entitled \\"The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude.<br /><br />This book will not make you laugh. What it will do for you is help you to explore a mystery that will test your faith. Dan Brown is a consummate storyteller. He knows how to weave an intricate tale of intrigue. This is a thriller at its best. Fasten your seat belt. It will be a bumpy ride.<br /><br />Davis Aujourd'hui, author of \\"The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude\\"
B001TH16DI|1.0|I mean, what is the point?  Are the movie companies so broke that they cannot just do their very best (and brushed over movies put into Blu-Ray format is not their best) and give the public something of value?    All of them seem to be trying to see how many ways they can sell the same thing that they severely cheapen their product and their name because it seems they are only interested in the money.  I suspect they would actually make more money if they did the right thing and made everything they do their very best instead of everything they do always a lot of not quite and almost there and close but no cigar.
B000002GBB|5.0|STYX (in the later 1970's) was the greatest rock and roll band playing. This album, PIECES OF EIGHT was the final masterwork from this grand band before their slow descent into the banal (see KILROY WAS HERE.)    As others have stated previously, this album flows wonderfully from beginning to end, with a modest bump in the road during THE MESSAGE and LORD OF THE RINGS.     RENEGADE and BLUE COLLAR MAN need no introduction to classic rock afficianados, as they are staples on radio to this day. In fact, these two songs may have been the catalyst for the downfall of the band, as Dennis DeYoung resented Tommy Shaw's hard charging songs for being the only \\"hits\\" on the album.     However, Dennis' own PIECES OF EIGHT and QUEEN OF SPADES just might be the most creatively brilliant rock songs on this album. From the soaring keyboard cords and vocal choruses, these two tracks take rather sublime lyrics within a still revolutionary sound that modernised their rather Tolkeinesque story lines into rock tracks of unparalleled beauty and force.    But the best tracks on the album are the slower, more ethereal, tunes from Tommy Shaw, SING FOR THE DAY (a wonderful minstral's song of the love shared between a band and its audience.)     A plethora of songs have been written about being a rock and roll band and the troubadore lifestyle of fame and fortune, but never had there been a song of such beauty and tenderness of such a subject (DEAR MR. FANTASY from Traffic does not compare lyrically.) \\"Hannah you're with me in spirit wherever I go/ From the ends of the Earth to all points between high and low/ each night by the stage you appear as you are/ the ever intangible child/ ageless in time as Adorian Gray/ oh, Hannah I know that it's you and you're leading me on... Hannah, don't fail me I need you like never before/ Father Time's on my back, at my heals, behind every door/ and he say's \\"Son when the youth has but gone from your face/ will she let you grow older with grace? Will shegive you up for one younger than you? Oh, Hannah please tell me the things that he says are untrue... I'm honestly hoping you'll always be there.\\"    Aku-Aku closes out the song with one of the most serene and soulful instrumental pieces as has ever been recorded. From the nearly sensual guitar intro through its gathering steam of layered instruments, this song yearns for a place within the audience's collective soul and offers nothing short of harmony and love for all who listen.    While THE GRAND ILLUSION has garnered far more sales and has collected many more awards (primarily based on the title track and the richly soaring anthems COME SAIL AWAY and MAN IN THE WILDERNESS), PIECES OF EIGHT flies through the stereo speakers with much more beauty and artistry than any STYX album before or since. The next time this band wouuld release an album that compares favorably to PIECES OF EIGHT would be in 2003 with their release (sans Dennis DeYoung) CYCLORAMA.     I cannot recommend highly enough the purchase of the album PIECES OF EIGHT, as one of the best rock and roll releases before the decline of rock and roll music and the decline of the band STYX. This album is well worth the expenditure of your 'pieces of eight.'
0307408833|4.0|This is a wonderful baking book. The Healthy Hostess (aka Healthy Ho's) are incredibly good, and on a trip the creek yesterday everyone was wow'd at how delicious these were and all wanted the recipe. After I told them about the health factor they were even more impressed.     As for the reviews complaining about the costs of things, please realize that you can substitute for cheaper ingredients such as canola oil and honey...another tip would be to buy just the needed amount of oil, sweetener and soy milk powder from the bulk dept at a health food store.    The main reason though that I love this cookbook is BECAUSE of the use of coconut oil and agave. Unrefined virgin coconut oil is wonderful for you [...] and is antiviral, antimicrobial and antifungal, potentially helping calm down a host of health problems. Agave nectar has a low glycemic index and is way better for you than refined sugar as well.     That she developed these recipes based around these facts is great, but the fact that she did this and made them taste outstanding is even better. The vanilla cupcakes taste more like a breakfast corn biscuit, but with a piece of bacon and an over easy egg on top it was reminiscent of bacon and pancakes with maple syrup :) Knowing what I am eating is good for me makes it far worth the cost.     I do though feel like it should have been explained how to make the spelt recipes GF.
0767020308|5.0|I love Kate Beckinsale as an actress (pre-Underworld!) and this is a far better adaptation than the Paltrow version, though it got overshadowed by it. Admittedly her Mr. Knightly is not as yummy as Jeremy Northam, but her performance is pitch perfect and the simmer of passion under the surface is just right.  Her awakening to her own faults and her relationship with Harriet is also very well done. Another wonderful British adaptation of an English literary classic.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Okay so get this out of the way.  The acting is horrible, the storylines are absolutely stupid as crap.  There is such bad reactions to things and there is horrible plot points that make no sense, and you end up laughing at the show more then being scared or worried for anybody in the show, except the grandmother (so don't get too close to her).  The show is bad, just plain and simple bad....AND I LOVE IT!!! I love it through it's badness, I love it like Rocky Horror Picture Show, it is so amazingly horrible, that you can't help but watch week after week, and episode after episode....you keep thinking it'll get better and it never does.  Who cares if they are like the books, grab a bottle of alcohol invite over lots of friends, spend the evening watching this show and making fun of it....It is well worth the time, i'm not joking...it is beautifully horrible!
B00005ASOC|5.0|I was highly impressed with the movie. It came on time and also in superb condition. I had no issues with the company that sent it. Thanks!
0525951113|2.0|I really enjoyed the first half of this book.  It was a fun fast paced story, great complex characters, the technology was spot on.  And then the story jumps forward 8 months and you're suddenly in the middle of a science fiction story where the villain has fast forwarded his technology 10-15 years worth.  (But only the villain.  All other geniuses on the planet are completely baffled by it.)  We're introduced to a whole new cast of characters that I don't buy for a minute.  People behaving in ways that make you roll your eyes.  Even the gamer dudes stop having fun.    Then 10 pages from the end in a fireball of a climax, there's a plot twist to make you doubt all the information you've been given and the pages just stop.  The story isn't rounded up to any kind of closure to the current story arc, any kind of plot summary, it just ends with an advertisement for the next book in the series coming out next year.
B000YENUI6|5.0|What an intense movie.  The best fight scene I've ever seen.  Naked with knives spells hurt.  Very painful to watch.  Viggo Mortensen did a great job - a departure from his other movies.
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|I am not a fan of Star Trek series, but after me and my wife watched the movie, i am now officially fan of this story. Love the plot specially for not a Star Trek fan. I am definitely buy the Blue Ray when it will be release.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|CSI Las Vegas was my favorite show until 'Dexter' came along. The writer's of Dexter make the viewer think 'deeply' about the characters. They are definitely not superficial fly by night characters, especially Dexter. He consistently says 'he has no feelings', but he REALLY does. I enjoy watching Dexter evolve into a person who really does have a conscience and cares deeply for Rita, her children, Deborah, and his colleagues on the force. The show makes the viewer wonder what they would do if they were Dexter, and I love that part of the storyline.     Although we are rooting for a serial killer, we are rooting for a serial killer who ONLY kills those who have murdered innocent people. Dexter is a super hero in his right. He just doesn't wear a super hero's outfit, like Batman or Superman. Bottom line, Dexter is doing a good service by getting rid of bad people who escape the confines of the justice system. Keep the season's coming! I am an addicted fan of the show--Dexter (Michael C. Hall). He will not disappoint current viewers or new viewers--try watching an episode--you will be hooked! Can't wait for season 4!
B001PJRAUS|5.0|When I went to buy this movie it didn't catch my eye all that much, but I was traveling and needed something to watch.  I absoultely fell in love with it.  I was already a Pride and Prejudice fan, but after watching this movie I have just become sucked into it.  It made me go out and buy the book and more of Jane Austen's books.  I highly recommend this movie to a women who truly believes in love.

B0002S943O|4.0|I normally don't write reviews, but I felt compelled to add my thoughts on this one. The concert is OUTSTANDING; the visuals, performance and sound are all incredible. I disagree that the DVD conversion is overly grainy, but I'll admit I've never seen the VHS so I have no frame of reference. As mentioned by someone else in this thread, Dave Gahan sure seems high on something... but, hey, it's rock n roll right? Besides, I think it's hard to deny that he spends an hour and a half absolutely tearing up the stage (and since I had a pint or two in me as I watched, who am I to judge?)!    I had originally \\"dinged\\" this DVD one star because of audio/video sync issues... I stand corrected!  Sadly, I apparently can't add the other star as I sit here and retract my original complaint : (  The real problem was with my optical audio and HDMI setup. I have no sync issues when the configuration is changed.  I'll have to learn how to adjust the delay settings on my receiver.    Even if you're not really crazy about Depeche Mode (I really wasn't until I saw a couple of their concerts), this concert is awesome.  Tons of energy, great sound, and loads of charisma.  If you dig watching concerts, this one is for you.
B000I2J6K0|5.0|I bought this along with the Perfect Pregnancy workout and Gabriel Reece's workout and am very pleased with this video.  it is a toss up which is my favorite as each one provides something different.  I really like balancing all three.    I find this video the most enjoyable in terms of the instructor's personality.  It is easy to follow and provides a good workout.  I've been exercising regularly for three years and wanted to maintain a level of fitness during my third pregnancy.  This video provides a nice balance of light cardio, resistance moves and some pilates moves.  I feel like I have been comfortably challenged when I'm done...just what I  am looking for! I don't love the music or the camera angles, but I'm in it for the fitness, not to be a film critic.    I would definitely recommend this video.  Very solid workout.
B0007DFJ0G|5.0|There is no point trying to describe this movie, except to say it is hilarious if you like quirky and silly humor. I don't know where the story came from (I assume somebody somewhere must have written something) but the director, and Brad, and Ed and Helena turned it into a great movie. Kudos to the director, and Brad, and Ed and Helena. Highly recommended.
B001AMVN3U|4.0|I'm used to having mixed reactions to The Offspring, but this strikes me as a very strong outing for them.  The lyrics are much more pointed than blunt on my favorite 5 tracks and the music is a very clean and cathartic sonic assault.  I don't recommend the whole album, but...    \\"Rise and Fall\\" is one of those odd tracks that is so flawless that it's almost not even there because it glosses by with such form and elegance.  It's very smooth and I like it a lot.    \\"Half-Truism\\" explodes over the top as a joyously spiteful retro power-ballad.  Goes well as an absurdist chaser after \\"Gone Away.\\"    \\"Trust in You\\" is an interesting character study track of the sort of person who has more scorn than common sense.  It's surprisingly well crafted and driven.    \\"Nothingtown\\" seems to be the teenage gotta-leave-town angst response to The Killers \\"Read My Mind\\" with a bucket of ice-cold reality dumped over its head but trying to maintain a bit of hope regardless.  The (out-of-place) doo-wop-iness of this track is comparable to, but nowhere as extreme as, TISM's \\"Greg! The Stop Sign!\\"    That said, \\"You're Gonna Go Far Kid\\" is far and away the best track in the batch.  Some people complain that it's ear candy, but it's far too well written to be just that.  It's a track about how dangerous competent rabble-rousers are and it's stunningly lucid.  It's a fabulous piece of work.  But maybe I'm biased in favor of the subject matter -- I judge debate tournaments for fun.
B001U6YI92|2.0|Let me get this out of the way first, the movie is a 5 star film.    Now that thats out of the way, let me continue on to this Bluray.    For some reason, the studio has found it necessary to infuse this film with DNR.  In fact after reading several reviews of the U.S. release, and seeing several screenshots of the U.S. release, I was floored by how awful this Bluray looks.    The faces look as smoothed over as a wax figurine in many many scenes.  In fact, if you've ever seen the Patton Bluray, this pretty much mimics it completely.    If you have the 2 Disc Special Edition DVD, just pull it off the shelf and watch it again, but don't support the studio on this awful cartoonish release of such a great film.
B001E3AXGS|2.0|I sent the book for a birthday present.  All indications were that it would get there \\"before\\" the birthday date.  After the fact I received an email from the third party that she does not check her email often and that the book just went out  -  well after the birthday arrival date.  So I am not too impressed with the third party situation here.  Also did not realize it was being sent by a third party so I do not know what went wrong.
B000002UAU|5.0|Sgt. Pepper is one of the best albums ever, and my favorite psychedelic album. Some of the songs have an orchestra playing, like \\"A Day in the Life\\" and \\"Good Morning Good Morning\\", making the album sound very different than any of The Beatles other albums. My favorite song is \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!\\". \\"A Day in the Life\\" is the most memorable song on the album. \\"Getting Better\\" is a fun song and is another one of my favorites. \\"Within You Without You\\", \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\", \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\", \\"Fixing a Hole\\", \\"She's Leaving Home\\", \\"When I'm Sixty-Four\\", \\"Lovely Rita\\", \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\", and \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise)\\" make up the rest of this classic album from 1967.
B001LF4IA6|2.0|The opening song is 'Outlaw Pete' & you wonder why he'd write a song like this, it's rubbish, then the final song is the truly bad 'The Wrestler' & whilst there are some good songs in between, the first & last taint the whole CD. Really, what's with the one-legged dog - what has happened to Springsteen, he used to write good lyrics?
B00003CXDD|2.0|Willow / B00003CXDD<br /><br />*Spoilers*<br /><br />As I write this review, I cannot help but note that Willow currently stands at an impressive four-and-a-half stars, and I fear that this review might not be received well by fans. This review is, however, for people - like me - who missed seeing Willow when it came out and wonders if maybe it's worth buying now.<br /><br />I like \\"old\\" movies, shoot, I just watched [[ASIN:B000R8YC1I The Dark Crystal]] for the first time and thoroughly enjoyed it. And I am very sympathetic to the argument that older movies should be judged for what they were at the time, and that it is important to remember that the fantasy genre was a bit more sparse in those days. I understand why people might have liked Willow then, and I can understand why the same people would still like Willow now.<br /><br />Having said all that, I do not think that many people who haven't seen Willow up until now, would like it at this point. This review is for them.<br /><br />Unlike the sharp, clear-cut direction of Lucas' other early works (most notably, of course, is [[ASIN:B000FQJAIW Star Wars]]), the script of Willow meanders painfully around, never seeming quite certain which direction to follow. The infant Elora Danan is prophesied to be responsible for the death of Queen Bavmorda, setting in motion Bavmorda's ill-fated attempts to murder the child, but the infant is never \\"responsible\\" in any meaningful sense of the word other than as a catalyst for the action. The main characters seem to stumble blindly through the movie, never quite certain what, precisely, to do with the infant, which might make for a believable plot (what does one do with a 'chosen one', anyway?) but does not make for an interesting movie.<br /><br />The addition of Val Kilmer's character is not a bonus for this movie. Kilmer is one of those rare actors who either does an exemplary job or a truly awful one, but never in between. Madmartigan is, supposedly, a sort of golden-hearted villain, along the lines of Jack Sparrow ([[ASIN:B00005JM5E Pirates of the Caribbean]]), but his character traits lurch randomly from noble to blackguard to lecherous, without any rhyme or reason other than the change of scenery and the needs of the plot at that timeline. Particularly annoying is the ridiculous romance subplot, which I found to be remarkably awful, even by Lucas' current standards.<br /><br />To wit, the evil Queen Bavmorda has a daughter who is the highly capable, well trained, and fiercely loyal commander of the queen's forces. She loves her mother completely and has few qualms about preemptively killing an infant in order to protect her mother. Really, you could not imagine a woman more in control of her faculties than this admirable, if evil, princess. She is immune to the charms of men, which is highly understandable since she has surely been inundated with \\"love struck\\" suitors all her life - being that she is beautiful, rich, competent, and heir to the throne. However, her personality changes in a instant - literally - when a magicked, love-struck Kilmer clambers into her bed chamber, mumbling nonsensical words of love. Within a mere matter of hours, the princess has transformed into a love-struck maiden, desperate for Kilmer's affections, and completely ready to betray her mother. That's either Very Bad Writing or Madmartigan is wearing Very Good Cologne, but I personally tend towards the bad writing side of the fence. It may seem like a small point, but the princess' betrayal is a large portion of the story and the entire catalyst to allow the ending to occur and the fact that it is done so poorly really detracts from the storyline in a serious way.<br /><br />There are good elements to this movie. Willow and his wife, children, and villagers are all superbly acted and wonderful characters. In fact, the point at which the movie can reasonably be said to have turned for the worse is when Elora and Willow leave the village - everything upto that point is extremely enjoyable.<br /><br />I do hope this review isn't too offensive to long-time fans of Willow who treasure the movie for nostalgia's sake. Nostalgia movies are wonderful and healthy things and I don't mean to criticize that in any way. I just want to caution newcomers that, for your money, there are other fantasy movies out there with more consistency of plot and character development than I, personally, felt was contained in Willow. Your mileage may vary, however.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardollisn't too offensive to long-time fans of Willow who treasure the movie for nostalgia's sake.

B001VPJZGI|3.0|I realize the product details mention this is the fullscreen (4:3) version of the movie, but I'm not accustomed to checking those details before I order DVDs since it's usually mentioned in the product title. Don't buy this version if you want to watch it in its native, widescreen format!
B001N4TIHI|3.0|I've seen the bad reviews but honestly - just finished watching this and I can see where the bad review stems - however the film keeps to the screenplay - it's a movie based on the play and really, theater is quite cheesy - this element is apparent in the film.  That said, I enjoyed it for what it's worth.  I laughed.  It was entertaining.  Cheers!
0321356683|5.0|I purchased this book last week from Amazon.com and already I am hooked to it.The style is not pedantic but thorough. Lots of tips for the everyday Java programmer from Josh (who wrote the Collections framework in Java).    Typically I skim over the chapter for Josh's tidbits of wisdom. I often leave the Mathematical rigor for later reading.    This book is NOT FOR IVORY TOWER ARCHITECTS!. Only Serious Java Developers should read/refer this book.
B001AVEJ1Y|2.0|I honestly and truly went into this trying to force myself to love it.. just so everyone wouldn't be right that I didn't love it. Yea, that's confusing. Well, I didn't hate it, if that's a consolation. Surprisingly the big gun, Capt. Kirk was the only thing in the movie that felt fairly natural. Everyone else is so preoccupied with trying to be 'their character' it comes off as a fairly shallow parody. Surprisingly even Sylar's Spock was fairly average at best. Every 'one liner' (Damn it Jim I'm a doctor not a...) the series housed in it's 3 year run was thrown in the Trek-style blender making the movie seem more like a rehash than a reboot.    The script was the other problem. The time bending 'back to the future or is it the past' script for a reboot is needlessly complicated.. Don't worry about spoilers, I can't begin to even explain certain why's and how's of pieces of the movie.. gah and I don't really want to.    Suffice it to say I again am in the extreme minority versus the reviews and Rotten Tomatoes. The villian is probably the worst part of the movie besides the script but anyone put in charge of a-big-drill-to-cut-into-a-planet-from-a-spaceship is bound to be lacking.    There is nothing about this movie that a fan of the TV show needs to see and there is nothing a non fan of sci fi cannot get from current superior sci fi like Sunshine or even the Battlestar Galactica series. William Shatner can rest easy, his legacy is safe. If the Classic Star Trek at it's finest is a fine wine, this new movie is merely Gatorade.    5 out of 10
B001N18HO6|5.0|The box set ticks all of the right boxes.  The LP's are collectors pieces, the artwork is magnificent and the memorabilia is quaint and nicely put together.    The packaging is solid and the disks are neat, the versions of the album reworked are fine.    It's a big fan box set. You have to love the album and the band for the purchase to be worthwhile.    So without delving into an elaborate and technical analysis of the sound and picture quality, all in all it was well worth it and I am stoked.    Oh, and the cassette is groovy too. (Haven't listened to it though!)
B000KF5776|5.0|I beleive this Japan edition is from '91 (according to back cover).  That's around 4 years after this came out in the first place and the recording probably sounds more similar to the original analogue (record) recording.  It has different frequencies than the 2002 US edition reissue, which I also have.  To compare, the 2002 edition is altogether louder, and seems to have more reverb, which means the guitar lines don't come out as crisp and clean as they seem to on this older Japan issue.  I prefer the Japan issue - while it is less powerful in the volume department, the licks just sizzle in a way that I like better than the 2002 US edition.  The reverb and volume boost on the 2002 edition make the recording somewhat hollower and muddy sounding by comparison.  This is just my opinion.  Also to be fair, I am using my dvd player and TV speakers so perhaps it is different for people with the proper stereo system.  All the same, I'm keeping my Japan edition and sending the other one to the second-hand shop.  Of course this Japan edition is too expensive, but if you can come by it for a reasonable price, don't hesitate.  It may give you a new appreciation for this album - prime Ozzy and Randy in a concert that is just first rate.  Hearing Randy's licks and Ozzy's voice without all the reverb (even the audience sounds better proportioned, more balanceed)  makes this a different album, and for this reviewer, a better one.  There is just more differentiation between the frequencies, Ozzy's voice and Randy's playing are cleaner and 'dryer' - in a way, more 'silent and proper depth' than the 'cave space' which seems to hover about the 2002 edition.  It's as if Ozzy, Randy, and the audience each have their position and you can hear where each is in relation to the other more clearly.  You do have to turn the volume louder than on the 2002 reissue but what you get in terms of warmth and clarity is better on this older version in my opinion.
1400032717|5.0|The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is a sweet book.  I read this book in 3 days because it is very easy to read and is very entertaining.  The book is told from the 15 yr old Christopher's point of view, who is autistic.  The book follows him as he tries to solve the mystery of his neighbor's dead dog Wellington and eventually discovers a family secret which forces him to runway.  He is unable to fully comprehend how people feel and why things are they way they are.  The book is funny at times, and is also quite touching and occasionally sad.  The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is now one of my new favorite books.

0345472322|5.0|I really saw myself in these pages and I wish I had learned this stuff ages ago.  Not that this is a panacea to all self-defeating attitudes and behaviors, but it certainly helps more than most anything else I have seen or heard.<br /><br />The basic idea is that you can approach things from one of two mindsets:<br /><br />-- Fixed mindset (talent and ability is fixed; therefore trying harder or challenging yourself will either not help any or expose you as not as smart/talented as you think you are)<br />-- Growth mindset (talent and ability can be learned; therefore trying hard, studying, challenging yourself will lead to an increase in your abilities and more success overall)<br /><br />(BTW, these are not mutually exclusive - you can be fixed on some areas and growth oriented in others - but one mindset tends to dominate in most areas.)<br /><br />The best part is that these mindsets can be learned and encouraged - they are not static and no one is \\"doomed\\" to live their life with a fixed mindset.<br /><br />Some reviewers seem to have been put off by the fact that she uses multiple examples to illustrate the points she makes.  To my mind it was a strength, not a weakness, of the book.  It offers multiple hooks for you to use in relating to the different mindsets and for relating it to your own life - an important element if you are to implement the strategies she recommends.<br /><br />She begins with detailed descriptions of the two mindsets and where they come from.  Then she moves into examining the roles they play in the lives of successful (and unsuccessful) students, teachers, artists, athletes, CEOs, etc.  Then she offers a workshop to help you (and others) develop a growth mindset.<br /><br />I guess what I liked best about the book was that it seems to be directly applicable not only to my own life but also to how I raise my children.<br /><br />She spells out how to give your kids the gift of a growth mindset.  Personally, I have been able to make bigchanges in praising my children in just a few days.  Now I focus on praising the effort, determination, and creativity they demonstrate when tackling a tough problem.  Instead of telling them \\"you are really smart,\\" \\"you're great at xyz,\\" or \\"you're beautiful\\" etc., I tell them \\"I like how you worked hard to find that answer\\" or \\"wow you really showed some creativity in working that out!\\"<br /><br />Additionally, I have also convinced my wife and family to shift their praise to encourage a growth-mindset.<br /><br />The point is that inculcating the growth mindset early offers them a life-long tool they can use to face challenges and overcome them.<br /><br />My only problem with the book, and perhaps this is merely my misreading of her thesis, is that it sometimes seems to discount the importance of results: the focus is on dealing with setbacks and finding a way to do better next time.<br /><br />On the other hand, I suppose that using this mindset will help deliver more and better results over time since you rebound from each failure and do what you can to make sure you don't repeat the mistakes that lead to it in the first place. (And, begun early enough, results should naturally follow.)<br /><br />But in and among all the wonderful information and specific advice Dr. Dweck provides, I'd like to see an acknowledgment that sometimes the world simply demands performance, not \\"I'll do better next time.\\"<br /><br />Still, there is enough valuable information and advice in this book that it is easy to give it a full FIVE STARS and to encourage you to check it out.
0307341569|5.0|Gillian Flynn has overwhelmed the senses again. \\"Sharp Objects\\" was almost a sweet tutorial of how flawed we all are. There are no angels  or demons; there are simply people. Us. And what we do with all the angst  and glory a day (no pun intended) provides.    As the first chapter opened, one of MY flaws was revealed. Libby was so  unpleasant that if I had to cut her slack for being over indulgently   ...overweight, I would just have no sympathy at all. Isn't that awful?!    There are so many layers in this book, it is almost like real life. In  three-hundred and some odd pages. (Yes, Libby/Gillian I am lazy, too.  How many pages?)    These people are dimensional and full and forthright in their humanity.  Mom is so harried, Dad is so selfish, Ben is so lost, Michelle is a breed  of person I avoid, so cannot label/libel, and Debby, poor children everywhere who belch bologna. Libby really is the least explained and that is a good thing. I think Ms. Flynn is wise not to try to explain the  surivors. Life MAY not be random, you might invite a god or two to explain why.....WHY one survives and others don't. I'm certain that all  surivivors have the same question: Why me?    Ms. Flynn does drama and mystery like a master (manipulator)! I hope to  NEVER see her \\"people\\" in a Lifetime Movie of the week or the Ladies'  Channel, whichever that one is. Her stories deserve full throated language and a broad canvas without the \\"Janet Jackson editors\\" cutting this and snipping that.    And I want to thank Ms. Flynn, personaly, for finding the most intersting snippets of my family and threading them throughout both her  novels. Harde har!!!  That truly was a joke. If your family is perfect,  this novel may not be for you. Then, again, with the many people I know,  I have not yet met one who has come out of this experience just a little  bent, folded, spindled or mutilated. (The \\"DO NOT DO\\" list from the back  of a NY State Thruway ticket. Who the h--- has a spindle in their car?)Thank you, Ms. Flynn
B0009HLD0K|5.0|Barbara Barrie asks, \\"Aren't you glad to be alive?\\", Paul Dooley answers, \\"NO I'm glad I'm not dead, there's a difference.\\"  I can't expect everyone to understand the complexity of this movie so let's say its a good movie to see once, its just like the movie 'Rudy' but slower. But for the minority of cutters like myself that have read lots of Mark Twain, Steinbeck, and Vonnegut - this is an American existential classic. Superficially, a coming of age movie with bicycles but on a literary level the movie is about how American society can convince middle-class youth of a false mythos and of how directed talent, a little ambition and a shot of self-confidence can transform; its about the joy of being young; and foremost it is about the existential becoming of the real person able to boldly move into the future by fully understanding oneself, (if any of my former Arizona St. U. classmates happens to read this review, don't laugh too hard!).

B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|Recently saw this film over the weekend. Exceptional. I was impressed with the visuals and amused by the story/plot which dealt the ever favorite Star Trek time travel alternate reality gimmick. Despite the plot being somewhat up unoriginal, Star Trek needed a fresh update. I've been a fan of Star Trek since high school in the 90's when it was considerably unpopular to be one. I've severval of the novels and have the dvd collections. I consider this film to be a revision of the basic story which was going to happen eventually anyway. Star Trek was never meant to be a dead (never changing) franchise or vehicle. Everything in scifi goes through a revision process (Flash Gordon, Doctor Who, Lord of the Rings etc.) And let's face it, there hasn't been a decent Star Trek film for quite a long time that can appeal to general audiences and thus have a lifespan. I can understand the gripes and complaints from die hard fans, but this is a good thing. People other than fans are talking about Star Trek again and there's a feeling of general excitement with the new possiblities for the franchise. Finally, this is a franchise, period and it has to make money to in order to survive, there's a business side to this too. I don't think Paramount has been completely destructive in it's use of Star Trek, neither have they really done much to help the franchise gain ground. There will always be fan generated fiction as there are with other franchises.
0739366408|3.0|This turned out to be a frustrating choice to buy on CD for a long car trip.  The character readers are very good, but they are so good with so much inflection, cadence, and accents that it makes understanding and following them difficult when your first commitment is keeping your eyes on the road (unless you want to crank your stereo up to deafening).  There were a number of times, especially with the Asian readers, that I realized after a couple of minutes that I had little idea what was going on because I had missed some important sentence somewhere.  When you don't know what's going on in a zombie plot, that's pretty bad.  Also, about half way through I became pretty bored.  Most of the book is military or political strategy or execution - or even human psych commentary.  That's interesting for a couple of hours, but then zzzzzzzz.  I could have used a lot more action/suspense with some additional blood and gore.  First hand accounts from the average joes (unless the point is that average joes for the most part didn't survive the infestations, I guess).  I'm not sure I would have made it through the actual book - being in the car made me a captive audience in a way.  Regardless of my personal taste, I think it's a must for zombie fans.

B00127RAJY|4.0|I purchased this dvd based on other customers reveiw and I am glad I did. I like the idea of doing 3 things , strength, cardio and ab work this keeps you from getting bored and just when you think you can't do another squat its time to change to cardio. So far i have only done level 1 and 2 .Sometimes if I have a little extra time and energy I do 1 then 2. hopefully when I mastered the moves on level 2 I will go on too level 3. Each level is a little harder than the one before.
0316067601|5.0|This book was awesome.  It really touched me and made me realize how truly brave the American military is.  It's horrible that deaths occur like this but that is how war is.  Extremely well written by a man who lived through it all.  Touching and leaves you feeling in-debted to the Navy Seals.  They guys of Seal Team 10 and others who died in the helicoptor gave it all and asked for nothing in return.      This is a sure read!

B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought this DVD to get back in shape after having a baby.  It really works!!!  I thought I was in pretty good shape going into the pregnancy and after and Jillian really kicks your butt.  I have been using it for about 4 months now and I have been able to shred the baby weight plus some extra pounds I have been trying to get off before the pregnancy.      I have worked out to all three levels in her workout plan and they are all good.  They do get harder, but I go through all three of them throughout the week to focus on different muscles.      I would reccommend this DVD to anyone trying to jumpstart their workout, trying to start a new exercise plan or drop a few extra unwanted pounds.  Even if you are in the best shape it is worth the $10 if not more than that!  I would have paid double to get the results I have seen.
B00000IAU3|5.0|No Angel being was originally release in 1999 but struck gold in 2001 by peaking at #1 in Austria, The Uk Albums chart, Finland and France. Singles realesed of this album are \\"Here With Me\\", \\"Thank You\\", \\"Hunter\\" and \\"All You Want\\". The booklet contains many photographs of Dido through her life. All the lyrics are included and we also have a list of whom plays what on the album. 5/5.
0061655546|5.0|This is a review of the afterword of the 2008 edition of the book. (The original book itself gets 5 stars for smooth writing, great coverage, and being an entertaining read of a historical event.)    The downside first: It needs competent proofreading!  Names are misspelled, sometimes appearing correctly and incorrectly spelled within the same paragraph, and there are numerous, jarring typos.  Looks like the publishers were rushing, or maybe there aren't any good editors/proofers in their employ anymore, what with all the cost cuts and the crisis.    On the upside, the new afterword makes this a great purchase, particularly if you don't have your own copy yet.  It's great to know what's happened to the key players who haven't been in the news much the past decade, and what's happened to the companies in the past 20 years. Importantly, there are good insights to be gained on how the passage of time has shown who the real winners and losers of the saga are.    For the upside, despite the downside, I'm giving this product five stars.
B000EWBC42|5.0|I must agree with all the positive comments that have been written about this Santana album.  It is simply a remarkable live album, contained in one of the most beautiful packages, if you are lucky to own the original vinyl issue.    The only quibble I have between the LP and CD version is the fact that the song \\"Savor\\" appears on the vinyl LP version, while the CD substitutes the song Mr. Udo.  Since I own both versions, it is easy for me to enjoy both.  But I hope on future re-releases, the song \\"Savor\\" can be added, even if it means adding an additional CD.
006112429X|5.0|During the height of the whole school shooting fiasco, I was in high school. I remember sitting home the day Columbine happened, and refusing to change the channel from CNN, and whatever updates were available. My stepmother was appalled then with my macabre interest in what was going on. I just think she didn't understand. We grow up with these people, and you see people group off into cliques leaving others to fend for themselves. Some handle it with ease, and some don't make it out alive.<br /><br />I admit to having a curiosity that borders on a fascination with the inner workings of the teen mind. Why some people handle things the way they do, if it's possible to be the change in the life of someone so sad and angry. Would a simple hello in the mornings have changed the path they followed?<br /><br />The subject matter was considered too raw when I was in the thick of it, but seven years later, authors are broaching the subject. And doing so with aplomb. I first read Nineteen Minutes by Jodi Picoult, and though I thought it was an amazing novel, I thought it left some unanswered questions for me. So I headed on over to the recommendations section and found We Need to Talk About Kevin.<br /><br />Lionel Shriver starts the book out slow. So slow in fact that you're tempted to put the book away for a good long while. Written from a mother to her husband about their son, none of the characters are immensely likeable. Trust me, do not put the book away. Soldier through the tough reading, and the horror of the extent of Kevin's sadism. The whole book is shocking.<br /><br />The book starts with a letter detailing Kevin's incarceration, and the reason behind it. He's killed several people at school. And his only regret is that his infamy was overshadowed by Columbine. His mother is only slightly more tolerable.<br /><br />Right from the start, the antagonism and disdain for each other is made clear. Kevin shows his true self only to his mother, who does not like what she sees. As you can imagine, this creates a very stressful tension between husband and wife.<br /><br />Dad is a man's man who ignores the fact that Kevin despises all things sports, and cheerfully soldiers on. He finally finds something they can bond over: archery. So he buys Kevin a crossbow and a target. Kevin spends much of his time outside working on his aim.<br /><br />The way this book is written and the context within make it difficult to read, but this is a book that stays with you once finished. It's powerful and dark, and you end it wondering if the author has some insight into a mind so venomous.es a very stressful tension between husband and wife.

0312370849|3.0|Anyone but me getting a little weary of this technique? While initially engaging, the story seemed to bog down about 2/3's way thru.     Found the protagonist's marital woes completely transparent--I believe anyone could have telegraphed the ending after the initial problem was revealed. Modern characters were barely even sketched out--more like pen drawings than fully-fleshed out participants in the story.    But as much as the modern story disappointed, the story of the round-ups at the Vel d'Hiver was pretty gripping. The drama was intense, the tragedies real (and plentiful). This book also broadened my understanding of that dark period in France's past.     So a solidly good if not great book.

B00003CX9S|5.0|\\"The Elephant Man\\" is simply one of the very best movies ever made. It was made by a diverse and unexpected group of people including executive producer Mel Brooks and uber-strange director David Lynch (Eraserhead) and stars the brilliant Anthony Hopkins and John Hurt in their best film appearances ever.<br /><br />The film follows the story of John Merrick (Hurt) in early twentieth century London. Merrick had been born with multiple serious deformities, and had been exploited as a sideshow attraction in a circus when he was discovered by the dedicated Doctor Frederick Treves (Hopkins,) who sought to help him and learn from him, despite much official and unofficial prejudice and dissuasion.<br /><br />The film focuses on human dignity and the ability of the human spirit to overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles and ignorant prejudice and hatred from fellow human beings. I am amazed at the interactions between Hopkins and Hurt onscreen: surely this is among the best acting in any production ever. Although the movie takes certain liberties with Merrick's life story, the film still stands as a testament to both these men and what they stood for, and, more importantly, to the capability for good, love, and compassion that mankind possesses. The film has many other excellent performances from preeminent actors and actresses (John Gielgud, Anne Bancroft, etc.) but Hurt and Hopkins are the two that make this film the piece of genius that it is.<br /><br />I rarely prefer black and white as a directorial choice, but in this case, the film is enhanced immeasurably by the moodiness it creates. The cinematography, direction, sets, and score are all equally breathtaking, and if you are like most people you won't move an inch for the mesmerizing duration of the film.<br /><br />The DVD comes with numerous extras, including interviews, and \\"making of\\" segments. Certainly this was a labor of love for all involved, especially John Hurt, who had to be made up in the most difficult and time consuming manner imaginable. Their efforts were not in vain, though, as the result is one of the most important films of all time, and certainly one of the best. I absolutely could not recommend a film more highly than this one, and as I sit here, I can't think of a single one that I think is actually better than \\"The Elephant Man.\\" Everyone should see this movie.imaginable.

0316017922|5.0|This is another great book by Malcolm Gladwell, following the prior two books he wrote: Tipping Point and Blink. If you read those and are a fan you will definitely want to put this one on your list.  Gladwell tackles another interesting subject, the super successful \\"geniuses\\" of our society. He convincingly argues that in addition to the individual's own intelligence, there are substantial situational and societal factors that have helped propel these individuals to their success.  I would highly recommend this book.

0385340990|4.0|As others have stated, the book is a sweet, easy read that does cover a topic--the German occupation of the Channel Islands--that little has been written about. However, the characterization of the islanders seemed too-good-to-be true (particularly the descriptions of Elizabeth), especially when contrasted with the dark sections about the German treatment of the Islanders during the war. I would have liked to have seen those elements more integrated with one another. Also, Juliet's romance was very stereotypical--lovely young woman pursued by gallant man-about-town until she realizes whom she truly loves. Overall, a worthwhile read, but I started out liking the book more than when I finished it.
B001R4MEYS|4.0|although i am mostly biased to listening to artists such as Dylan,Cohen,Cave,to name but a few,did i have my fair share of exposure to the kings of metal,Black Sabbath.In fact,i still rate many of their albums as being of substantial influence in the development of music,and just downright excellent.  Being therefore partial to the Sabs,Judas Priest Led Zeppelin,and the \\"old school\\" metal,i was introduced to Mastodon via a critique on their previous cd that appeared in a non metal magazine.  i explored and i was impressed.  i eagerly awaited the release of this album and must say it is as good as its predecessor.i find that mastodon displays influences by the above named greats,yet have so much individuality that it can be safely stated that they have brought along their own brand of genius.  and thankfully,this is not one of those bands who attempt to drown out every syllable through undecipherable angst.in so far as lyrics go,it is intellegent,above average (although,it is still heavy metal!)and definitely not attempting to be more.  each and every song on this album is representative of a tight unit,high quality music,and honestly some of the best metal produced this decade.  i do not believe in tags such as heavy metal album of the year.i believe music is good across any genre and i recommend this album,to any one who is willing to overcome any bias towards heavy metal.this is the future of good heavy metal,and it will at the end of 2009,count as one of the top albums of 2009.
1400067936|2.0|To say the least an unorthodox book, filled  with musings, life lessons and philosophy of the author and one central theme about probabilistic events and how they are perceived and misinterpreted by even well trained professionals.      If Mr. Taleb had stuck to his original thesis instead of branching out needlessly and had used the services of a professional editor, it would have made a more pleasant but much shorter read.  Yes, there is also way too much of Mr. Taleb in the book, obviously a very smart and cultivated man with a sizable ego, who seems to carry a certain bitterness too.     What was more interesting was the clash between the Middle Eastern genes of Mr Taleb and the extremely quantitative and results oriented culture of Wall Street and West in general.  This is probably what led him to the thoughts that resulted in this book.

B00005JMJ4|5.0|To me this movie is about those sacred moments when you meet somebody and you silently and slowly fall in love.    You don't talk about it, to nobody, not even your partner!, and to some extent you don't even think about it...to the extent that it could take days before you *realize* that you are in love...    In a Zen-like-state of mind stillness, your are sometimes to afraid to 'move', fearing that you may destroy that moment.    Trying to describe these moments and feelings is impossible, and the real meaning of these moments and feelings gets lost in translation when you try to put it into words.    In my mind, his last words to her before leaving for the airport, was:    \\"I will get divorced, and then come back for you.\\"
B000MZHW40|5.0|This is a fast moving movie, as fast as Di Caprio speaking the patois of the region, Sierra Leone in the middle of a civil war (though actually filmed in gorgeous Mozambique-super job!)<br /><br />Di Caprio as the soldier of fortune who suddenly develops a conscience thanks to Solomon Vandy, (Honsou), is terrific. His demonic boss (\\"Mummy\\" lead and '24' alumnus Arnold Voszlo) is yet another obstacle they need to overcome if Solomon is ever to find his son and help him recover.<br /><br />This is a non-stop action film with a serious message, for the African nations really are suffering due to the blood diamonds (and indeed, mining of all kinds all over the world is still a very exploitative industry).<br /><br />Di Caprio puts in another great performance, a terrific lead in to The Departed.
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|There was a day when no movie-goer could imagine a SHERLOCK HOLMES film without the superb Basil Rathbone portraying the great detective.  For two decades most would have balked at the idea of anyone cast as TARZAN other than the beloved Johnny Weismuller.  In the 1950's all would have agreed that endearing George Reeves was the end-all and be-all SUPERMAN.  And in 1965 the magnetic Sean Connery was literally the most famous person on Earth, his place as the one and only JAMES BOND seemingly forever secured by an adoring public.<br /><br />We all know the rest of the story.  In large part due to the brilliance of those \\"original\\" performers the public craved for more of their favorite heroes.  Despite the lack of eternal youth in those worshiped thespians, the \\"powers that be\\" delivered new adventures for us all to enjoy.  Names such as Roger Moore, Christopher Reeve and Jeremy Brett were soon spoken of with an admiration equaling that of our friends of old.  The iconic characters had proven themselves far bigger than even the most successful actors that had ever been associated with the roles.<br /><br />For 40 years STAR TREK fans would accept no substitutes in the portrayals of the original Enterprise crewmembers other than the vibrantly talented William Shatner, the artistically gifted Leonard Nimoy, and the rest of our familiar screen companions.<br /><br />Time always reveals the icons.  It's not always explainable, but the concept of STAR TREK, the good ship Enterprise and the heroes who inhabit her, have become immortal.  Kirk, Spock and their starship will voyage on far beyond not only the careers of specific actors, but also beyond our mortal ability to enjoy them.  Think not?  Then just ask the guy who lives at 221 B Baker Street.  Or the Lord of the Jungle.  Or a certain mild-mannered reporter.  Or the man known as Agent 007.  The STAR TREK characters have now ascended to their pantheon.<br /><br />Have you been hungry for a new STAR TREK adventure?

B000WTNCYA|5.0|I heard a very catchy yet slightly haunting song in the background of a made-for-lifetime movie and knew I had to track down what song that was.  This song and one by Circe Link were the highlights of the movie.  The song was \\"Sweet Memory\\" by Melody Gardot - and I'm so glad I put in the effort to find it!!  Now that I've listened to all the songs on this album, I know that Melody Gardot will be on my Watch List for a long time.  I already have this as one of my favorite albums, and her knew one is quickly rising in the number of times I've played it.<br /><br />Not quite mellow, but not upbeat, these songs easily fit whatever mood I'm in.  What a treat!
B000M341QE|5.0|This was an outstanding cast for a remarkably tightly made film.<br /><br />I am not normally a fan of Matt Damon or Mark Wahlberg, but both of their performances rose to the occasion here.  Jack Nicholson steals every scene he is in, as usual, but in this case, his character is so terrible, he is truly fascinating.<br /><br />But the real revelation of this film is Di Caprio--he has been putting in solid performances in The Aviator, Blood Diamond, and is completely spellbinding in The Departed.<br /><br />I think everyone writes him off as Jack in Titanic, or a Hollywood 'pretty boy' but wow, he can act. This is fast moving and utterly fascinating.

B000G8NXYG|5.0|This film arguably Kurosawa's greatest film. This particular version allows us to see his masterpiece in unprecedented clarity. The new translation provides the audience a greater emotional understanding of the plot.     The humor and action are timeless entertainment. I was honestly expecting to become bored given the extremely lengthy presentation, but not a scene is wasted. It tells a fairly simple story but develops each character meticulously. You will remember scenes from this movie for weeks to come and will be compelled to watch it again and again.    The documentaries are excellent additions. One provides information about early Japanese films and the other gives us an entertaining glimpse into what it was like to shoot Seven Samurai. There is a very dull interview with Kurosawa that should be skipped by all except the most avid of Kurosawa fans.    I also feel bizarrely inclined to mention the beautiful packaging. The fold-out DVD box is adorned with iconic scenes from the film. The color scheme is pleasant. The booklet that comes with it also looks very artsy. It comes with information to teach us about the creators of the film and essays from various movie buffs to provide different perspectives about the importance of the film.    All in all, a fantastic package that should not be missed by anyone who considers themselves a movie fan. As trailers of the movie gloated without restraint, it might be \\"Japan's Towering Achievement\\" in film. 5/5
0143038419|2.0|I'm not sure who started the hype about this book, but it's not true.  While the author's storytelling is witty and funny, this does not make up for the narcissism of a relatively spoiled woman who happened to encounter a kink in her life (a bad relationship). Rather than doing anything that could help better the world with the year she is given to take off and write this book, she spends her time fussing over a cute boy or two in Italy, obsessing over exactly how to meditate in India, and justifying the break from her self-imposed year-long fast from sex while she's in Indonesia.  The Pray section of the book is the most annoying, and I would have stopped reading the book altogether had I not promised the girlfriend who gave me the book that I would read it.  The book lacks any depth (emotional, cultural, or otherwise), and inspires its readers to nothing but their own self-centeredness.  The only thing going for it is the author's wit.

140120841X|5.0|I have to say, I thought the movie rocked. But afterwards I had the pleasure of reading the book and it is even better. Going into the book with a little background helped me sink right into the familiar world but after that I was hooked on the art and story. And to quote the cliche \\"If you think the movie is awesome you should read the book.\\" There's about 40% more characters that are all interesting, and a different dynamic to the characters I was familiar with. For example, the print version of V makes Hugo Weaving's character seem gimmicky. I would recommnd this book to anyone who liked the movie, and moreso to those that didn't.
B000P0I4OY|2.0|I have read all the previous reviews, unfortunately after seeing the film. I am amazed that anyone would give it more than two stars-it made no sense whatsover-and there was no ending or any attempt at disclosing a \\"plot\\". The presence of Freeman and Cusick saves it from being a complete negative, but one suspects they will do anything for a buck,  Bad, bad writing.  I'd ask for my money back, but I saw it for free and even that was too much.
0307269191|4.0|This is a good book for those interested in running or in the author.  It's a very quick read, and brief, probably too brief in parts.  At less than 180 pages, that's not a lot of space to talk.  In addition, he wanders into discussion of triathlons for several pages, which those running purists will not like.   However, for the space involved, it is worth reading as there are a lot of insightful things said about how running interacts with one's head and with one's life and work, even if you are not an author.  Worth reading!

It catches your attention from the first line by bringing strange random data and bringing a pattern/logic to it.  Is about not only of success, but about human random behavior which has no explanation but the true nature of us humans. Is not about how to become a hero, but about understanding that the everyday work matters just as much as the very must important day of our life - in fact it is by hard work that we build such a moment which brings success in our destiny.  Unfortunately, the author failed to wrap up all of the different patterns into one single lesson at the end of the chapter, instead he chose to talk about him and his family.

B001R4MEUC|5.0|Genesis' fifth studio effort Selling England by the Pound was released in October of 1973.<br />By 1973, Genesis (which comprised of singer Peter Gabriel, bass player Mike Rutherford, keyboard player Tony Banks, drummer Phil Collins and guitarist Steve Hackett) had developed a cult following and respect with rock fans. However, the band's commercial aspects in the US were not great as Buddah Records (who distributed Charisma in the US) did nothing for the band. Charisma changed distributors Stateside from Buddah to Atlantic (which was home to Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, Cream and many others) and this gave the band some confidence to record its next album as they were now at the same home as Zeppelin and The Stones. Would Selling England By the Pound be a classic or would the band fall from grace. Read on and find out.<br />We open the album with Gabriel singing the acapella intro to \\"Dancing With the Moonlit Knight\\" which told the tale of the demise of \\"good old England\\" and the rise of commercial, modern England. Gabriel's brilliant vocals and lyrics are matched by brilliant guitar work of Steve and Mike and additional musicianship from Tony and Phil as the song becomes a superb climactic rock number after its soft start. Next is the band's first UK Top 20 hit \\"I Know What I Like\\". This piece tells the story of a lawnmower sitting on the porch which was one of the band's first tracks to feature a synthesizer and a great piece. Next is the majestic \\"Firth of Fifth\\". It begins with a piano solo by Banks and launches into a grand epic. The song features a flute solo, a synthesizer solo and one of Hackett's most memorable guitar solos. The first half closed with \\"More Fool Me\\" which was Phil's second lead vocal with Genesis. A nice break-up song written by Mike and Phil.<br />The album's second half starts with \\"The Battle of Epping Forest\\" which is an epic about a gang fight with references back to medieval England and excellent muscianship by the Genesis members. Great piece. Next is one of Hackett's classic guitar pieces \\"After the Ordeal\\". Next is the epic \\"The Cinema Show\\" which is one of the band's best epics. From the opening 12-string guitar doodle, you are then thrown head first into a beautiful song for six minutes. Then, the song breaks into a superb synthesizer solo section which is hard to describe. We close the album with \\"Aisle of Plenty\\" which is somewhat of a reprise to the album's opening track but a nice piece nevertheless.<br />Selling England By the Pound gave Genesis their first crack in the US Top 100 album charts peaking at #70 in 1974 paving the way for more success in the future and eventually reached Gold status in US sales. It reached #3 in their native UK. Sales aside, Genesis were maturing and becoming a band to be reckoned with.<br />In November of 2008, Rhino/Atlantic re-released the album as a CD/DVD set. The album was painstakingly remixed by engineer Nick Davis in stereo for excellent sound (in a similar manner to what was done to The Who catalog in the 1990s). The new mixes are AMAZING and I hear things in the new mixes that I have not ever heard before. The DVD was in 5.1 and had an excellent slide show with the album and interviews with band members, their classic Shepperton Studios concert that was filmed around Selling England's release but only aired on Italian TV but scrapped by rest of the world (but widely bootlegged) and the Batalcan Theater in France earlier that same year.

The band was at first cold to the idea, but the fan/musical producers prevailed, and after many, many performances, and now a movie, Abba has come around.<br /><br />------------------<br />Sophie: [reading Donna's diary] We danced on the beach, kissed on the beach and dot, dot, dot.<br />=================================<br /><br />Mamma Mia! was wildly successful, but lots of critics took aim, some calling it the worst movie of the year. I think that Mamma Mia! appealed to an untapped older audience nostalgic for the days when Dancing Queen ruled the airwaves and the dance hall. I think it was more like a Fantasy Camp for actors who always secretly wanted to be rock stars, and also wanted a chance to get away to a luscious Greek Island. It is like singing Abba at a Karaoke bar--and what is the point of judging it on the basis of the singing? It is the fun factor that is paramount. The people were having so much fun making the movie that you can't help but be caught up in the festive mood. What does Meryl Streep have to prove as an actress? Did you want to see if she could master yet another accent, and emote flawlessly, as if it were her native tongue? Don't you think she could do that blindfolded in her sleep with one hand tied behind her back?<br /><br />----------------<br />Donna: And welcome to- to Sophie's dad. I have to tell you, he is here.<br />Sophie: I know, I invited him.<br />Donna: You couldn't have, I don't even know which one it is.<br />=====================================<br /><br />Meryl Streep's acting was bad, but it was fun to watch her let her hair down and just have fun. How often do you get to see Streep, master thespian that she is, act badly? Pierce Brosnan signed up on the strength of her name alone, without even reading the script. Was he disappointed that she didn't bring her \\"A\\" Game? No, he was relieved that his acting wouldn't have to be judged in comparison. It was bad enough that of the whole cast, he was judged the weakest singer.<br /><br />Brosnan, Colin Firth, and Stellan Skarsgård were the three men from Donna Sheridan's past who might be Sophie's (Amanda Seyfried's) dad. Skarsgård was the token Swede, and I am only mentioning him at all since I wanted to make use of my Umlaut font set, but I was glad to have him there, as after all, Abba was a Swedish group. The three possible fathers were more than adequate to their roles.<br /><br />----------------<br />Donna: Wh-wh what are you all doing here?<br />Bill: I'm writing a travel piece.<br />Harry Bright: I- I'm on a spontaneous holiday.<br />Sam Carmichael: I-I-I I just dropped in to say... hi.<br />===============================<br /><br />The three woman, led by Streep, were really great. Here is some interesting background trivia. The women who wrote Mamma Mia based the character of Tanya on Mary Ann, a character played by Christine Baranski on Cybill Shepherd's eponymously titled sit com. No wonder Christine Baranski was perfectly cast as Tanya, and the catharsis is complete.<br /><br />---------------------------<br />Tanya: [talking about Donna's money troubles and her life in general] Yeah, but are you being taken care of?<br />Donna: What do you mean?<br />Tanya: Are you getting any?<br />Donna: Oh, you mean...<br />[turns on the screw driver, making loud noises, then says to the screw driver:]<br />Donna: Down, boy.<br />===================================<br /><br />Julie Walters as Rosie was also a little show stealer.<br /><br />------------------------<br />Rosie: [to Tanya] Typical isn't it? You wait 20 years for a dad and then three come along at once.<br />============================================<br /><br />So, if you want to pass judgment on a movie and fault it for bad singing, bad acting, and over or under exposed film, then by all means throw those rotten tomatoes. But if you want to have fun, fun, fun 'til your daddy takes your T-Bird away, then what are you waiting for?

B0015DWJX2|5.0|Gorgeous book - simply gorgeous.  One moment you're laughing. The next, crying, but all the time absorbed and involved, just as main character Juliet was in the lives and persons of Guernsey, with whom she corresponded, then met, and then.................<br /><br />I read it on airplanes and in New Orleans on holiday. Couldn't put it down - well, except between sips of red wine and forays into the French Quarter and finishing it on the descent back home to San Francisco.<br /><br />How did these authoresses do it?  Do what, you ask?  Seduce me into caring intensely about these unlikely, ordinary/extraordinary characters through the medium of their letters.<br /><br />This book is by women, about women (mainly), and probably for women. With so many spot on hilarious comments about men, why would a man read it?  Easy answer: because \\"The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society\\" is probably the most charming story about the horrors and humors of World War II that anyone would have the privilege to read, especially those of us who pride ourselves on loving the small cadre of brilliant authors (almost all of whom are men) of that exalted era in history, during which time the forces of good actually won out over evil on a global scale.<br /><br />Yes, the repulsive Nazis play a role here too, but are uplifted by one German man we never meet, Christian, whose unfolding subtle presence takes some of the edge off the monstrous and unforgivable.  This one soldier, through his daughter Kit, 4 years old and growing into our beings, saves the entire German nation.<br /><br />Whereas \\"If on a Winter's Night a Traveler\\" by Italo Calvino is about reading, this book is about writing. Its brilliance forms a revival - even if fictional - of the great art of letter writing - funny or nasty, crisp or rambling, to the point or vague, but always endearing. You know, the kind of letters you really wish you could write, maybe once did before e-mail ruined everything (including spelling), but especially those correspondences that simply demand an instant reply where you stopped everything,  put pen to paper, dashed it off, sealed it into an envelope (with no copy made), and posted it forthwith.<br /><br />There's only one point where the story is helplessly predictable - during the found Oscar Wilde papers, but even that stupendous episode is fun - no, its' greatly entertaining.<br /><br />Hang in there for the first 50 pages, don't try to force a change in the perfect structure of the story, slow down and put yourself there --- 1946 right after the war -- on the only piece of UK soil ever to be occupied by Germans (for 5 years !!) as it recovers its soul. The Guernsey folks reminisce and tell their stories of those terrible and glorious 5 years.  The 12 to 15 key players are all vivid, knowable and individual. Every character is clear and definitive. There's a believable story line centering on Juliet (an author who is not from Guernsey), as she accidentally discovers the path to writing her book about them and, coincidentally, the loves of her life.<br /><br />Clever, engaging, emotional and bell-ringing clear, it's a 5.<br /><br />While I knew these things about Guernsey already - that is, the bare facts about its subjugation for 5 years by Germans -- now I want to go there, and I will.ces that simply demand an instant reply where you stopped everything,  put pen to paper, dashed it off, sealed it into an envelope (with no copy made), and posted it forthwith.

0060595183|5.0|One of the most articulate descriptions of the 'psychedelic' experience, (which is notoriously difficult to describe). I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in this subject.
B00169XU8I|1.0|I am a big fan of Madonna, but she owes me $40.00. First of all the ad says DVD \\"sized box\\", I took it to mean there was a DVD inside. There is not. It says it comes in a beautiful box with hinges. It does not. The box is cheap. Inside is her DVD that is a year old and costs $9.99, plus a cheap bag of Christmas candy. SUCH A RIP OFF! If the box was nice, it could be a collector's type of item, but it is not worth it AT ALL
0618918248|4.0|In 2002 Richard Dawkins presented a talk to TED called \\"An Atheist Call to Arms\\". Four years later, after Kitzmiller vs Dover (the famous evolution versus intelligent design court decision) \\"The God Delusion\\" represents the start of a movement known as \\"New Atheism\\" where atheists are called to unite under a common banner, to come out of the closet and to admit that they don't believe in any god's and everyone else should get used to it.    \\"The God Delusion\\" represents a scientists approach to the evaluation of religions. He dismisses the philosophy and instead focuses on what the science leads him to conclude about the world. The most controversial and important idea Richard Dawkins presents in this book is the notion that calling children such titles such as \\"a muslim child\\" or \\"a catholic child\\" ought to make us wince as children could not be informed enough to make up their mind about the big questions of the universe.    Personally this book was important to me, because it lead me to the realisation that I share many of the beliefs of Richard and fellow atheists. I however doubt this book could be used to de-convert the fundamentalist.
0316143472|5.0|I found each story very intriguing and funny.  It is interesting to see how David's life changes with exposure to fame, some money and a good companion.  And yet... David seems to not change at all in his essential self.<br /><br />It was particularly amusing to read his view of Japan.  I have spent a lot of time there, and found his views both irreverent and gentle at the same time.  All I can say is that I hope he finds other excuses to live in other countries sometime soon.
B001TK3XOA|5.0|This book should be required reading for all of humanity.  I've heard/read the concepts before, but not as accessible as this.  For someone who cannot connect with religion because of the \\"rules\\" that separate those in from those out, this is the connection to God/Universe/everything-nothing I'm looking for.
B001PL4HZW|5.0|I should admit that I am a Twilight fanatic and I can't get the movie or the books out of my head while listening to the soundtrack and probably that's what makes it even greater for me. However with bands like Muse and Linkinpark and the new not-so-much-heard ones like Mutemath, Blue Foundation and Iron and Wine in the picture this track becomes a MUST. And those of you out there who smirked at the idea of Rob Pattinson singing HAVE TO listen to him. No one believes it the first time they hear his voice. It's so excellent that I think he should give up acting and focus on music very seriously.
B0002KVULG|4.0|\\"Dracula\\" starring Frank Langella is by far the best movie ever made, based on the famous blood-sucking character Count Dracula.  Filmed in the 70's as a turn-of-the-century film, it does not feel at all dated.  This movie focuses on the love story between Count Dracula and his beloved Lucy.  While there is some killing in this \\"Dracula\\" version, the over-the-top violence found in modern \\"Dracula\\" movies is not present.   Co-star Laurence Olivier gives an outstanding performance as the monster hunter Van Helsing. If you like \\"Dracula\\" movies this would be a great addition to your collection.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I was a little skeptical when I read the summary and saw the first promos for this show.  However, I am very happy to say the skepticism was not warranted in any way.  The casting is perfect for all of the main and recurring characters.  If the role of Castle wasn't written with Nathan Fillion in mind, one couldn't tell.  There is no-one better for this role.  The writing is witty and never overdone or mean.  The acting is wonderful, no scenery chewing (thank heavens!) or false steps.  The direction is great, letting the actors do what they do best while keeping everything moving at a good pace.  I can't wait for the DVDs or the next season!
B000001IPL|3.0|3 1/2    Though its power-chorded repetitions can wear thin, one must admit that this marks another peak for punk-pop which only may fall second to Green Day's Dookie.

B00008O31H|4.0|The formidable indie-blues-rock duo eased into their stride with this sophomore release, a highly solid collection of deceptively simple, reverb-soaked ditties. By any means it shouldn't sound as authentic as it does, but for some reason the group is just able to tap into old southern rock attacks with a natural grace unfamiliar to a vast majority of modern artists.
0199537038|4.0|Hardy was a naturalist in whose novels everything goes wrong.  Michael Henchard is a drunk who \\"sells\\" his wife Susan and infant daughter Elizabeth-Jane to a sailor.  Susan doesn't realize the sale is bogus because she is \\"simple,\\" throws her ring away, and leaves with the sailor.  When he sobers up next day, Henchard searches all over for his lost family, and finally enters a church and swears an oath over an enormous bible that he will not drink from his current age of 21 to double that age.  Meanwhile, and 18 years later, when the sailor dies, Susan, with Elizabeth, comes looking for Henchard at Casterbridge.  He is now a corn merchant and mayor of the town.  As a teetotaler, he is described as drinking glass after glass of water at table for a town hearing.  Eventually Susan, via Elizabeth-Jane, contacts Henchard and he pens a note suggesting that they meet at the \\"Ring.\\"  This last turns out to be a ruined Roman amphitheater or coliseum, a 1500-year-old relic full of ghosts and whose very name symbolizes the dark past.  Henchard and Susan agree to remarry, playacting a courtship for public appearances, and to keep the daughter in ignorance that the sailor was not her biological father.  After they marry, Henchard and the manager of his business, Farfrae, have a falling out because the latter shows the former up and makes a fool of him, making himself more popular than the mayor.  To make matters worse, Elizabeth-Jane falls in love with Farfrae.<br /><br />Frankly, that's as far as I've gotten.  I know how it ends for Henchard, but I won't spoil the ending.  Hardy is a mean naturalist writer, and has no sympathy for his characters whatsoever.  _Casterbridge_ was first published in 1886, when alcoholism was little understood - least of all by people like Hardy who didn't have the disease.  It's all too easy for this author to condemn and be judgmental of alcoholic people.  I would suggest for an alternative reading Eugene O'Neill's _The Iceman Cometh_, since O'Neill was himself an alcoholic and could rightfully speak for alcoholics.  The subject, no matter in whose hands, is by nature depressing.  All my editorializing aside, Thomas Hardy is a great novelist who has earned his place in the canon.  His poetry is good, too.  _The Mayor of Casterbridge_ is worth pursuing to the end if you're not an alcoholic.himself an alcoholic and could rightfully speak for alcoholics.

B000XUOIQ4|4.0|I am trying to get all the Disney classics and I don't remember watching this movie when I was a kid but it was available so I bought it...and it's okay but I can remember now that I have it, why I didn't really watch it when I was a kid. It's kind of boring.
B000000Y2F|3.0|3 1/2    Although it is virtually guaranteed to provide worthy stimuli, perhaps this duo caught the 'Trane a little too early in his career to truly harness the potential only hinted at with these sometimes sublime, other times underwhelming readings.
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|I had high hopes for this movie, and it exceeded all of them.  JJ Abrams has managed to capture the essence of what Gene Roddenberry created without just re-hashing what we have seen before.  In the process, we have a movie that satisfies life long fans and newbies equally.  The time-travel theme was never so boldly executed.  The whole Trek universe is changed, not for the better, but for the different.  We can experience the adventures all over without being bound to cannon.  Brilliant.  Nothing in this film is cheesy or exploitative.  The performances are all Oscar worthy.  In fact, the actors (with the exception of Simon Pegg) evoke their predecessors excellently, without simply mimicking them.  Bravo.  With respect to the great Simon Pegg, he has made Scotty all his own, but it will be better for it in the long run.<br /><br />Please Mr. Abrams, keep 'em coming!  Heres to the next 40 years of Star Trek!
015206396X|5.0|Since others have summarized the book, I will concentrate more on my impressions of the book and the reasons why I gave it a five star rating.    The book starts off a bit rough; the action scene at the beginning is fun but leaves the reader with little context of what is happening in the world.  The backstory that appears in the following chapters is standard for a fantasy novel except for the Graces and is the worst part of the entire book.    Then something happens that is really quite extraordinary.  Po arrives and the story flips into \\"romance\\" mode and becomes considerably better.  I should mention that I, as a guy, have never said that before.  Although Cashore's use of language is not extraordinary, the scenes shine with an inner light and tension that makes them almost visible rather than merely reading them.    Then something just as extraordinary happens, the story flips back to \\"fantasy\\" mode and gets better yet as the plot begins to move in unexpected but logical directions.    I expected that the book would flip back to \\"romance\\" mode at some point and it did but it also somehow stayed in \\"fantasy\\" mode for the rest of the book and kept getting smarter and better up to the surprising and endearing ending.    I was torn at the end between hoping for a sequel and hoping that the author was going to move on to other stories.  She's done a great job of wrapping up all of the loose ends and I'm very interested in finding out what else she has to say.  But on the other hand, the characters really are very interesting people and it would be sad to not know what is going to happen next in their eventful lives.    Well done and I look forward to her next book!
