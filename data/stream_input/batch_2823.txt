B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This a good child game and a game for any body. I suggest it to any one who is a big fan of the movie
0786956291|5.0|Consider buying a starter book too, since this kit will guide you until level 3 (which is kind of fast).
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I enjoy finding the animals for my zoo,awaiting to expand their family's then releasing them. The colorful animals are clear with details. I thought this game was boring but was I started I have to work on my zoo.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Already had the android so didn't make sense to buy a kindle.  Love having books without carrying a tote.  FUN!
B0067R0APK|4.0|I can even get international temperatures. I like this app more than my other weather apps. Simple. Graphs. Maps. Rarely crashes.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It is fun to have something to fill the time when 'waiting' in line, dentist office, etc.  Always loved solitaire
B008ER9QLK|5.0|I enjoyed every segment of each disk. The extra material, including interviews and background stories are wonderful. Yes I loved the set. It's all very well described here by others. I love it that the production was carried by PBS and that many Americans had free access. Only recently I have gained a secondary access to PBS in HD via Comcast cable. My primary source is Direct TV. I will probably continue to buy every Met opera offered in Blu-ray. It is the best way to enjoy opera short of being there. Recommendation: If you want to enjoy opera on a home screen... you must have a high definition TV. The best you can get is what I suggest. That new 4k Sony 65 inch screen is what I would choose today. My sound system is quite fantastic. If you are serious about it... you must have it. I have 7.1 installed and it is great for every variety of music based programing... except talking heads. You don't want that on the big sound system. I also avoid full sound when I am viewing day to day TV entertainment. The self-contained sound of the new TVs is all I want for that... it is plenty, and also great for music. There is a wonderful world of classical music, opera and dance available here at Amazon. Classic film is another treat. I would like to see more theater productions on Blu-ray, as well as on PBS. We need more arts brought to our homes. We need a full time high definition arts channel. Right this is off topic... but I did it because I am shocked how few opera fans use HD TV or have even noticed it. DVD is truly outdated by Blu-ray. Ding dong ...dvd should be dead.<br />-R Perschmann
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This is a fun game! It starts of easier and then becomes more of a challenge, in a good way. I would recommend it.
B00AZMFK3K|3.0|OK. I saw the first of J.J.'s Trek movies and I did enjoy it, simply because I was starved for some new Trek. Upon watching the 2nd of J.J.'s movies (and saw it twice, because my daughter wanted to see it again), I am much disturbed by the direction this series is going. First of all, I agree with one reviewer that J.J. seems to be dumping everything Gene Roddenberry built. Secondly, are we to believe that an organization like Star Fleet, which is responsible for the safety of hundreds of planets, has such shoddy discipline on the bridge of a starship that the only way they can get things done is to shout at each at the top of the their lungs, and punch each other out? No just once, but multiple times? Like a bunch of school kids fighting to be king of the mountain? And this is supposed to be a responsible redirection of Star Trek? Well, it seems this once great franchise is going in the same direction as our society: morally bankrupt, senseless violence, with no standard of ethics (the idea that the only one who is right is \\"myself\\"; tough if you don't like it).<br /><br />Star Trek once stood for a disciplined application of moral and ethical standards. Guess that's all been thrown in the trash.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This is a great sandbox version of  the Virtual City game.  However, I like the challenge of completing quests and the side quests just aren't enough for me.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was challenging but not impossible. The game is intuitive and logical. Similar to Doors but puzzles don't require shaking, tilting, etc. There's a consistency in the game play that relies on problem solving. Very enjoyable.
B0009KA7BS|5.0|I wish this had a spin-off TV Series on HBO/Showtime/Cinemax or something? A great sequel would even suffice! I received this disc in perfect condition and in, what seemed to be, no time!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This application does an excellent job monitoring battery strength, very nice interface. I recommend this completely.Go for it, yes ?
B002IW8V0E|5.0|I was simply looking for the DVD.  But for my $8 I received The DVD, a sing along DVD, a Making of the movie, and to my surprise the Box had little rhinestones on the front, and if you pushed on this one spot, the Rhinestones starting flashing, very brightly!!  The DVD package arrived in only 2 days,  Needless to say, I am VERY PLEASED.  I would use this seller again.. no  problem.  :-)
1590171993|5.0|Seldom has a book had a more perfect cover. It is dark, serious, and intense, yes, but then so is John Williams' 1965 novel of university life. Look more closely at the figure on the cover and you will see a man approaching middle age, a man of great sensitivity, upright but private, lost in his own thoughts; appropriately, this is a Thomas Eakins portrait entitled \\"The Thinker.\\" In 1910, William Stoner sets out to walk the fifteen miles from his parents' farm to Columbia, Missouri, to study agriculture, boarding with a relative and doing farm work to pay his way. In the middle of his second year, an acerbic English professor challenges him with literature, and he secretly changes his major, staying at the university during the war years to complete his doctorate, and teaching there for the rest of his life. The book opens with reference to his death in 1956, still only an assistant professor, half deaf, and with a reputation as a campus curmudgeon. A failure, then? Not a bit of it! As the book explores five decades of Stoner's life, the man we meet is a person of passion, someone with a great potential for love, but too much principle to give in to the enmity of others.<br /><br />It may be the best novel of university life I have ever read. But Williams makes little allowance for non-academic audiences. One crucial scene in the middle shows the oral examination for a PhD candidate in English. For those of us who have been there (on either side of the table), it is perfect, but it does require some familiarity with literary history, campus politics, and the styles of academic bombast. The exam is the turning-point in the relationship between Stoner and Hollis Lomax, his department chair and implacable enemy. Lomax is a superb portrait: physically deformed, academically brilliant, and motivated by an inexplicable hatred buried deep in the psyche. But Stoner is not to be defined by university politics, but by his commitment to his subject, his increasing abilities as a teacher, and above all by his value as a human being.<br /><br />It is here that John Williams connects most strongly with the lay reader. Vicariously, we join in his intense friendship with two student colleagues, we feel his attraction to the beautiful banker's daughter from St. Louis with whom he falls in love, we despair at the failure of the marriage, yet share in Stoner's intense love for his growing daughter. Edith, Stoner's wife, is another of Williams' most brilliant portraits. As with Hollis Lomax, there is no easy explanation for her irrational behavior, but we sense its truth nonetheless. And when Stoner, in his forties, falls in love with a graduate student, we rejoice to see his intellectual respect and innate sensuality finally entwine and blossom. Later still, at sixty, he thinks that \\"he ought to be beyond the force of such passion, of such love.\\"...<br /><br />\\"But he was not beyond it, he knew, and would never be. [...] He had, in odd ways, given it to every moment of his life, and had perhaps given it most fully when he was unaware of his giving. It was a passion neither of the mind nor of the flesh; rather, it was a force that comprehended them both, as if they were but the matter of love, its specific substance. To a woman or a poem, it said simply: Look! I am alive.\\"a teacher, and above all by his value as a human being.<br /><br />It is here that John Williams connects most strongly with the lay reader.

B009MO5ES8|4.0|I really like this movie, Joseph Gordon-Levitt is very believable as a bike courier.And Michael Shannon is very good as the baddie. It is very fast paced through-out.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Not only does it have great graphics, it is highly addictive too. If you are thinking of buying this app DO it is so worth $7
B0036TGSJ4|4.0|Emma Stone does a good job as a girl who becomes notorious by telling a little lie. But what begins as a small lie, becomes to much to ignore. Her parents are quite funny!
B006RZFACU|5.0|What a great idea for a bedtime book by Peter Collier! It's not just a great story; it's also amazingly innovative. There's plenty of happening, even though it's a foggy, dark, dull grey town. The imagination of this author is astounding. Start with nothing and end up with a creative and imaginative book that's well worth reading.
0060752610|5.0|The insight in this book is valuable. It teaches more of a mindset rather than straightforward techniques but, is amazing to have as a starting book.
B00D23GXB2|5.0|The fourth entry from award winning author G.P.A.(Greatest Poet Alive) is breathtaking. The Poet and author has expounded on his own intimate and sexual adventures without being crass or offensive. My favorite was the excursion titled \\"Westin Incident\\". Talk about seeing a short film on paper!! This Poet has certainly outdone himself.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Skyfall being the latest James Bond movie, was not included in Volumes I, II, III, or IV.  This completes my collection .

B009K916ZK|4.0|Subject says it all.  As with all Apple products, you can expect it to work well, and you can expect that it should have been lower priced ;)
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Really Cute, fun to play, ive always been a fan of my little pony so i had to try it, its hard to keep money with the goals.
0061950726|5.0|I love this author's writing style.  The book was so easily read even with the switching from two very distinct eras.  I plan to buy more of her books.
B009HNDCC4|5.0|This season is fantastically witty, and addicting! I bought the entire season and viewed all of the episodes within two days!
B00CKR63F2|5.0|Review of Sheryl Seal's Bridalveil Fall Beyond Bridalveil Fall by Sheryl Seal is a well written fantasy romance tale which reminds me of such stories as Lord of the Rings, Alice in Wonderland and most of all the Tales of Narnia. It is well paced, with believable characters which are a tad over endowed with magically charms for my taste, but Sheryl makes it work. It's an age old morality tale of good versus evil with properly devilish evil foes that must be defeated while the main character must deal with her own emotional roller coaster regarding the handsome love interest. But despite his appearances may not be the man of her dreams after all. Sheryl provides a delightfully twisted tale filled with intrigue and mystery enough to satisfy fantasy fans of all ages and either gender. Sheryl's use of National landmark as the portal to this other world added just the right touch of reality, much as was the case in the Wizard of OZ. I can see this story becoming a standard in the children's fantasy genre. Very nicely done-5 stars. You may think you're writing about a queen or a fairy tale land or even some God awful dragon, but in reality you're writing about the people who inhabit your story. What they think and what they dream of, of who they hate and who they love and underneath it all, you're writing about yourself. ~Cliff Roberts
B007SGM084|5.0|These wonderful novels cause a  amazing natural glow to my face. Some would call it blushing. No makeup needed. Thank you
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love this game so much because you get to drive a car and catch animals. I also love this game because it makes me feel like I'm in the game.

B0067TQQI8|5.0|My phone is a HTC One X+ and it drains battery like crazy, I'm a computer engineer and I visit clients, I had to charge the phone twice a day but sometimes it was difficult to find a near available outlet, and the USB ports on my client's computers didn't charge the phone very fast because of the low amps that USB can handle.<br /><br />So I decided to order this external battery and I'm very happy, It's the best investment for my phone, the phone charges fully (from 5 or 10% battery left) to 100% in 2.5 hours connected to the 2A out, this 8400mAh battery is capable to charge my phone up to 4 times before recharge is needed, last week I took a trip in my car that last 10 hours and the battery kept the phone charged the entire trip using GPS and listening my music via Bluetooth from the phone to the car receiver.<br /><br />When you need to recharge it, it charges kind fast, it takes aprox 8 hours to fully charge connected to my USB 3.0 outlet in my computer, I've never recharged it with a charger connected to an outlet so I can't tell how much it takes to charge connected like that.<br /><br />The battery comes with a USB cable and many tips to connect to different devices such iPhone, iPad, Samsung, Sony, Nokia, HTC, Blackberry, Sony Ericsson, etc. It also comes with a pouch to protect it and cable storage<br /><br />The only con I see is that it doesn't come with it's own charger, but it's compatible with my HTC charger and USB cable so this isn't a real issue for me, maybe for somebody with an iPhone or any other device that uses a different charger connector would need to buy and additional charger, but I use the same cable to charge my phone and to recharge this external battery
B008KWTF2O|5.0|After a lifetime of fighting my curls, my new job leaves precious little time for the daily fight.  I bought the book, found a Curly Girl stylist in Richmond (2 hours from my home), and got set up with the right products.  Having people stop me on the street to rave over how gorgeous my hair looks and how much younger I appear is something every 55 year-old woman wants to hear!
B00499NHLC|5.0|It's a tough call whether this series or the Guy Ritchie movies better capture the spirit of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's famous detective. I am partial to Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of the consulting detective on the big screen, but I was extremely pleased with the acting abilities of both lead men in this BBC short television series. Benedict Cumberbatch captures all of the quirkiness of Holmes (minus the opium addiction, which must still be too taboo for any modern medium), and Martin Freeman comes on splendidly as Sherlock's sidekick and biographer, Dr. John Watson.<br /><br />This is a must-see for any Sherlock Holmes fan, and I also highly recommend it to anyone who likes mysteries, drama, comedy, or movies in general. At one and a half hour long episodes, these feel more like movies, but thankfully there are more than one put out per year!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I've read all Mr. child's books, and pre-order the next title when I can.  The tales are wonderful, the story-telling magnificent.  Lee Child is still a young man, so I hope to continue enjoying his efforts for years and years.
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|I would not reveal that the &#34;sibling&#34; was a chimp in the reviews and on the book jacket.  I'll never have the chance to know what the book would be like if I discovered this part of the plot on my own.  (Maureen Corrigan revealed the info in a radio review --it's a hook but also a spoiler.)
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|The Snowman is the type of story where you can't seem to turn the pages fast enough at the same time that your anxiety level increases to the point that you are afraid to turn the next page. Jo Nesbo really delivers tension and mystery in this tightly-woven story featuring detective Harry Hole, a truly human protagonist with a sixth sense that enables him to solve serial murders. First rate crime fiction!
B00BRYDKM8|4.0|If you can understand and has the method to deliver a good 21' speack you need read this book. It's one of the bette book I read about public speaking. You can find the right formulas, well explained and in the correct secuence. It's more than a book, It's a complete manual for you
B007X15GRQ|4.0|I didn't think this was the best Wahlberg movie but it was entertaining anyway. It had great actors in it and I would absolutely watch it again.
B002UD56I6|5.0|This movie was exactly what my wife wanted, thank you for giving me a great option, to keep this wonderful lady happy!!!
B00846TTDG|5.0|This is hands down one of the best movies I've ever seen. The movie wouldn't have been as good as it was if it didn't have real Navy SEALs in it so I'm extremely grateful that the director was able to get real SEALs to do this and I'm extremely grateful to the SEALs and other military personnel who took time out of their lives to shed light on what they do for a living. This was an outstanding film and I plan to watch it a lot more than I already have.
B0048KUAJY|5.0|This movie includes some hints to the &#34;back story&#34; of Nanny McPhee.  It also made me call a couple of used book dealers to start looking for the ORIGINAL series (three books about &#34;Nurse Matilda&#34;) and see the original insiration for the books.<br /><br />I also love the way Maggie Smith was brought into the story.<br /><br />A great family movie.
B005LAIH2C|3.0|This is a very campy, ridiculous horror movie.  It's got a ton of special effects that are not entirely believable.  However, for what this was, it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.  It managed to hold my interest all the way through no matter how ludicrous it seemed at times.  Luckily, it was short enough to not make me lose interest.  It's running time was barely under an hour and a half.  The movie is a fun, no brainer entertainment.  Just don't expect shakespeare or something fantastic.  Although I'm a little stunned that there is a rumor that a part two is in the works.  That's pushing it.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I love hidden object games and this is a good one. Two things I don't like:<br />1. Always want you to connect to a social media program.<br />2. As of yet I have found no variation in the hidden objects. Each room has a set list which makes it a bit boring after you have found them 50 times before.
B003D8KH9A|3.0|the cover is a great idea for this pool, but the pool is the problem, it would get a hole in it, but the cover worked well when the pool was inflated well
B00AOCLWF6|4.0|I think the short review above sums it up.  If you like sci-fi you'll probably like this. It's a bit predictable but all in all its very well done.
1451695195|5.0|Very clean book! No sign of wear or tear or dents or anything! Saved me some money instead of dropping a huge amount at my local university's book store. Thanks! Hope to do business again soon!
B00004TDTO|5.0|Love this movie.  A must see on the hottest day of summer. We make popcorn and kick back to watch &#34;Jaws&#34;. It has become a ritual at our house.  So glad I bought the dvd!
034580404X|5.0|Even though there is a lot of sexual content, this story, I find, is about two young people learning what love is, discovering they want to love each other, and are enjoying every minute of it! I am in the middle of book 2, and I have not been disappointed.  My hubby is enjoying the &#34;fruits&#34; as well!
B001LRJH0U|1.0|I had such high hopes for this movie, but it's a yawn fest. It's just a convoluted mess of a plot and after watching it for 20 minutes you just won't care anymore. I would suggest better westerns.
B00AH69T22|5.0|This is a great oldschool metallica cd. It has a ton of great songs that are hard and fast. I would highly recommend.
B00DDZM0GQ|4.0|Neat tetris-like game. I def spent a little more time playing this game than i should have. A good game to play to pass the time.
B00D7HXSVQ|5.0|Rick Stein is one of Britain's top chefs and this well produced book covers a TV series he made earlier this year travelling across India and sampling its culinary delicacies. Well written witty travelogue, loads of great colour shots, and of course a very wide range of recipes.<br />Sure it is expensive but worth every cent believe me.
B000IZ6URY|5.0|Get's even funnier each time you watch it; amazing technical work/ production! Wish they came out with sequel. Refreshing to have cinema from other political view points.

B00005JOHC|5.0|love it!! i watch it every day and it makes me laugh so much. love all three characters. i would recommend it
B0036S4B6M|5.0|The author kept my interest throughout the entire book! To think about how many young adults just do not understand what they are getting themselves into should read this book or watch the series.
1592402038|5.0|Who would have thought that grammar could be such a scream? I dipped into this book to brush up on my grammar, but I got a lot more than I bargained for. Witty, useful and very clever, I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to improve their grammar, or even if you just want a good laugh.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love Sherlock Holmes and Downtown Abbey on the BBC.  It's just fun to watch.  I love fun historical shows.
B002RI90WM|5.0|Fantastic book. Stein had me captivated from start to finish. Definitely worth reading and sharing this wonderful book with your friends.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|The game is a real brain teaser. I look forward to more levels. A couple spots were quite hard to solve but the graphics are great and if you do get stuck google the level on the Internet.
B0037QGRZG|5.0|This is a great movie. The new &#34;Karate Kid&#34; is so ridiculous, it's Kung Fu not Karate, China not Japan. Completely ignorant and disrespectful to the memory of Pat Morita.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game has to be the best game ever I used to think critical strike<br />Had good graphics but I am blown away with this game the multiplayer is fast and fun.the campaign is very extensive<br />Gameloft has once again made an amazing game it also works great on my kindle worth the 4 dollars
B0041KKYBA|5.0|The movie is so important that it should be required viewing for every voter in the United States. It is so disappointing to see how greed has infiltrated and influences our elected officials and academics. It is a must see.
B003XDVVO0|5.0|Bought the shoe for beach,clamming and kayaking.  They fit well and stay on much better than expected in mud. Also good protection form rocks.  Supers easy to clean.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|Great Movie.  Good acting and great special effects.  I would recommend this movie to anyone that likes fun, easy to watch movies.
B00181JGI2|5.0|One of the most creatively filmed pictures of all times. This is a cult classic, but can be enjoyed by anyone. Great acting, music and imaginative scenes.
B004EPZ034|5.0|This is a great kid and adult movie.  I liked this just as much as my 4 year old.  I would recommend this movie to all friends and family.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|Few narratives are tougher to stomach than this one: children being forced to kill other children. And yet, this premise is absolutely believable, given the violent wars being waged in Africa and the Middle East, and the nuclear arms race that continues to gather steam.  This is an entirely possible apocalypse, and one we must acknowledge if we hope to avoid it.<br /><br />This movie presents its subject beautifully; hauntingly so. Katniss is a heroine you simply have to meet.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|The way to live your life presented in this book opens up a whole new world. The four agreements sets you free!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is a lot of fun to play. My only complaint is that there are some loading issues for the kindle. Sometimes it will freeze in the loading screen.
B0073COMKW|5.0|Works great. Color is great. Generates no heat to speak of. Price is right. What's not to like?<br /><br />Only CON that I can say it is that it is very unattractive looking when not lit. But how often are you going to stare at a light bulb and say 'wow, that is one UGLY light bulb'?!?!?!?! I am just waiting for the time when these things come down to 3-4 dollars apeice. Give them a few more years and we'll get there. ;-)
B00008DDHZ|5.0|Having grown up during the Viet Nam War, the daily papers usually contained body counts on the front page. One gets desensitized to this and the numbers tend to remain numbers. This film drives home the fact that there are names attached to those numbers, and those names have families.<br /><br />Here's the scoop. It's January 30th, 1972. Irish Parliament member Ivan Cooper is organizing a huge peace rally to get the Brits out of Northern Ireland. The Brit military is on hand in large numbers. Things start out well enough but a small faction of the Irish protesters confront the British troops with harsh language and rocks. They're met by live ammunition leaving 13 dead and 14 wounded.<br /><br />Anyone knowing director Paul Greengrass's work in the Bourne films can pretty much forget about those while watching this. The slick sheen of the Bourne films is replaced by the immediacy of the cinema verite style here. Greengrass puts the viewer in the middle of everything. Natural lighting, hand held camera and natural settings all add up to give the viewer the feeling of immediacy. These don't feel like actors, they are real people. The rocks are real. The bullets are real. And when you see family members crying over their dead the result will rip your heart out. Greengrass clearly sides with the Irish. He doesn't absolve them of guilt by any means. Some broke off from the whole and antagonized the British troops. But, at the end of the day, no British soldier required medical attention, where 27 Irish were either killed or wounded. That alone speaks volumes.<br /><br />This is a powerful movie. If you have the stomach for this kind of horror, it's well worth your time.
B00DAXXO98|5.0|Kevin Spacey doesn't let you down and I love watching and waiting to see where he goes. Just thinking that this is how government and life really is working. I guess we all do what we need to do for the greater cause.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|What can you expect for $35?  Well, I'm impressed.  While I've only had it for a week, here is what I've found:<br /><br />- Setup is easy.  Only took a few minutes.  Just plugged the ChomeCast dongle into the TV's HDMI port and plugged-in it's power cord, then fired-up my laptop and it was working in less than 5 mins.  My home WiFi network (provided by an old Linksys router) was all that was needed to connect it to the network.<br /><br />- If you stream Netflix or YouTube, you can even turn off the laptop or tablet after the video begins.  Evidently, the ChromeCast dongle (plugged into the TV's HDMI port) gets the video directly from the network!  Very nice.  Of course you lose the remote control function of the laptop or tablet if you turn it off.  This is a great piece of engineering for $35.  While I've had a Netflix streaming subscription for something like a year, I've used it more in the past week than in the past year.<br /><br />- If you stream from the Chrome browser (using the new little button in the top right corner of the browser that the ChromeCast browser plug-in displays) then the laptop receives the media from the server and forwards it on to the ChomeCast dongle plugged into the TV's HDMI port.  This works well, and both the sound and picture come thru the TV.<br /><br />While I'd like to see Amazon media streaming enabled as per YouTube and Netflix, I'm very impressed at what this thing does, and for only $35.
B0031KE9C6|5.0|I love all the story lines and just the characters how they all blend together at the end of the show sometimes good and sometimes not so good. Sure a lot is did that really happen or could it but who cares I love the entertainment.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|Typical reacher ending. Always satisfying. Seemed a little slow going at times but, as always, necessary for the back story.
B004S5C91Q|4.0|Novel topic and well written. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and couldn't put it down. Definitely worth a read !

1439130833|5.0|After reading &#34;the Secret&#34; I wanted something more and this keeps me on track, thinking positively, especially if I am having a trying day.<br />I am also reading &#34;the Power&#34; by Rhonda Byrne and am so grateful she chose to write these things down.
0810993139|5.0|I love that this book is hardcover, and I love that it arrived in great condition.  $4 for a used book in gread condition is awesome.  I was going to check this out from the library for my 2nd grader, but all those little boys hands all over that one book, that was well worn, grossed me out.  Glad we got our own copy.  He can take his time reading it, and reread it later.  Thank you Amazon.
0345803507|5.0|This book ended with a summary of Christian Grey's thoughts and a replay of the story in his own words. That really could be the next three books to this series or at least a 4th one.  Fifty Shades Revealed!!!! I Loved this series and I did not want it to end.  I must say it is going to be interesting to see this made into a movie.
B004S3MB2U|3.0|I was traveling and was without connectivity for a week.  Couldn't use NeoCal because it needed to connect to the Internet.  Very disappointing.<br /><br />If you purchase NeoCal, be sure you have a backup plan if you need to do calculations when you can't access the Internet!<br /><br />I've purchased licenses for NeoCal for all of the platforms that I've used... It is a wonderful calculator when you can use it.<br /><br />Edit:<br />I contacted NeoCal support about the issue and I very promptly received an email explaining that it's the Amazon Appstore DRM that is trying to access the Internet to verify licensing and that Amazon claims they only need to access the Internet about once every 30 days for this verification. This is true of all DRM-enabled apps purchased through their store.<br /><br />It is pretty clear to me that Amazon's DRM is broken as I used NeoCal just before boarding the first of many flights for the trip.<br /><br />I will be following up with Amazon's customer support.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Felt like I knew all these people by the time I finished the book.  Reform must happen to this system.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Me and my sister are both big fans of my little pony so when this game came out we were very excited. We have been playing this game for a while now and we are very pleased with what we've seen. We both agree that this is one of Gameloft's best games. The animation is bright and colorful, they have all our favorite ponies including Derpy, and even all the same voice actors from the show.<br />  The only problems we have with the game is that the mini games can sometimes feel repetitive and we find it easy to accidentally spend gems when we don't want to.<br />  But despite these problems we highly recommend this game to all bronies and pegasisters.
B000VZKMSO|3.0|Expect BIG SOUNDS, creative and new. the album carries a consistent fun, boastful, celebratory feel to it. First listen the new sounds were overwhelming and I miss some of the socially conscious themes of other kanye records

B001JNNDE2|5.0|this movie is great and always makes me smile. The extra features on the disk are funny.  Try watching this movie on a &#34;bad day&#34;.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|I absolutely love The PianoGuys. Their music makes my day... everyday. :) This CD is wonderful, and the music videos that come with the Deluxe edition are worth it for only a few dollars more.
B006ID6NDQ|5.0|brought the atmosphere of WW 11 alive with all of its angst and terror of hiding her Jewish faith and missing the proper papers that were all-important to living and moving around Nazi Germany and other parts of Europe. Her alliance and eventual marriage to a Nazi officer put her at high risk. Edith Beer is truly a skilled writer and I look forward to reading any future books that she might pen.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I gave this CD to my husband for his birthday, and he hasn't stopped listening to it since! The music is inspiring for any day of the week.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I found Ender's Game a beautifully written book. I loved how the points of view would change from time to time. It followed their failures and triumphs, their good days and bad days.  In the end, I found the book very moving with the whole Speaker For The Dead thing. All in all, magnificent. Bravo. Three cheers for Ender's Game! Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!
B000001GYC|5.0|I enjoy listening to Mendelssohn's Songs Without Words.  Both Friedman and Perahia have made some excellent 5 star recordings.  These recordings were made by DG and are quality recordings.  In addition to Songs Without Words, there are 10 additional tracks on Disc 2.<br /><br />I highly recommend these recordings.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is amazing. has amazing quality and keeps you busy. I recommend this to all horse and animal lovers alike.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|After reading Da Vinci Code I was hooked.  Angels & Demons was almost just as good and I'd say this installment is on par with Angels & Demons.  Good read...love the characters.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|Kingdom Rush is a very exciting game I even got my husband to start playing with me. I totally give it 5 stars
B001BKVWYG|5.0|We had never heard of Rodriguez before seeing &#34;Looking for Sugar Man&#34;. He is an amazing song writer and performer never given his due. So glad to see his talent acknowledged and celebrated at this late date. This CD should be in every music lover's collection.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|Overall I thought the idea of the book was interesting, yet there was something lacking in the plot overall.  I did not feel like the book ended up flowing very well and I think the author left many holes in the storyline that did not make sense.  It was okay.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|The story had a decent premise. The hero was close to believable as a guy that is kind of superhuman when it comes to knowing what to do in impossible situations and somehow always being prepared. Prepared except when the plot point is that they/he are not prepared. The other characters were well played too. Enjoyable.<br />Some of the plot devices got tedious like the window missing from the poshest hotel in the world and not even housekeeping even noticed.<br />It was good I suppose but another thing that was weird was that the crew went from grim and distrustful in one scene  to jovial and wisecracking in the next.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I am spreading the word with this book! it's all we know for those that love this typed of mental attitude, with science and spiritually combined. I just love how she is so right spot on and down to earth with her explanations, anyone new or old to these ideas will love this and the experiments will be used in my personal practice as well now !! Thank you for such a wonderful read, reminder and the inspiration to get back out there and continue the manifestation of life !
B005QYKD4I|3.0|I had avoided these movies on general principle. It was included with prime so I thought &#34;What the heck?&#34;<br />I'm too old to have played with the toys and hadn't seen the previous movies. Maybe they explained the unique characteristics of this universe before. The lack of any logic made up or otherwise made it so I couldn't buy into anything that happened. Even the love interest part made no sense. The girl was pretty but not super pretty and kind of an idiot. The guy was handsome but still a lame loser. Even if he did have a special rapport with the machine being things that was no reason to suddenly give him a leadership position.<br />That all said, the action and CGI was fun to watch.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Easy to play and always fun. And best part the app is free, can't argue with that. Great. Great. Great.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I find the new format update to be too busy visually. I don't like all the pop-ups and things I have to close and open to just get the weather report.

B00ECU2RGY|4.0|Cool story line and awesome effects! Very worth the rent. Tom Cruise does get to do some running, as you'd expect.
0061733199|4.0|I thought the book had a lot of good information for the inexperienced person such as myself.  I shared it with my children and they are looking forward to trying some of the things out.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I play on this game all the time it is the funniest thing to do the a t graphics and soooooooooo realistic like having a real horse of your dreams<br /><br />Donna and
B0012GTZC0|4.0|I truly enjoy Ken Follett's books, but prefer the more historical ones like The World Without End and Pillars of the Earth. Each of his books takes me back in time and drops me into a time and place I had never imagined. What a refreshing way to spend time.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|An iconic film.<br />(And they want 17 more words.  I guess they're not into that whole, like, brevity thing, man.)
B00BHMF578|3.0|Not what I was expecting. Most of it dull and boring. Acting was so - so, average at best. Glad I didn't pay to see it on the big screen.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|If you're a Stallone fan (I LOVE HIM!) + a fan of the other actors/their movies . . . you're in for a treat!!  Listen closely for the efforts made by the writer, giving us movie fans many recognizable lines from the other actors' movies . . . the movie is action packed, and is a lot of fun (wish it didn't have one very sad part in it, but I guess it was necessary to get to where the movie needed to go) . . . I'll see any movie Sylvester Stallone is in . . . which is why I didn't listen to the critics' comments . . . glad I didn't (they were a bit too harsh, at least that's what I think) . . . so pop your popcorn, have your soda & snacks on the table, and E-N-J-O-Y!! :  )
0374531269|5.0|Knowing my son and what things he is and always has been interested in I picked this book from the list and I did a Great job! Really good book for someone to read who loves things to do about history and wars! thanks!
B0084TWN9K|1.0|The book was listed as highly acclaimed and illuminating moments in a person's life that changed them forever. It was far from that. I started reading and generally found them boring and outdated. Several were from  a time in the middle of the last century! They didn't illuminate anything. The stories were poorly written, often seemed to ramble and with characters that were not easy to relate to. I gained no insight, had no &#34;Ah huh&#34; moments and kept telling myself the next would be better. It wasn't and before I was halfway through the book, I had enough and closed it for good; the first time I did that in more than 20 years. There have even been some bad books that I read all the way through. Not this one. Don't waste your money unless you just have trouble sleeping at night and want to be bored to tears.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|These have to be the prettiest rendered horses I've ever seen on a mobile device. Simply gorgeous. I like that you can earn diamonds, as they can be expensive, though earning them is an incredibly slow and tedious task that never ends. However, many of the tack items are severely overpriced, with just the saddle costing nearly as much as the most expensive equines. O.O<br />Saddles for 100 diamonds, a unicorn for only a few more? Who came up with their value system?! There are tack sets that can cost hundreds of diamonds, and diamonds cost a lot of real cash. That's about my only complaint.
B000I9YLUI|4.0|I'm not a fan of Keira Knightley, but this version of Pride and Prejudice was surprising.  It definitely captured the spirit of Jane Austen and also the longing and pining that goes along with every one of her stories.  The sparks between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett were so tangible and juicy!  I really enjoyed this movie.  I had just seen the 1980 BBC miniseries - and it didn't capture the same emotion as this movie, though the miniseries was faithful to the book.  I would definitely recommend anyone to watch it.
B00CS74W0C|5.0|Excellent book and love the characters.  Love that Ava is a strong woman. Can't wait for the fourth to come out.

023076651X|2.0|Not useful or insightful at all: if I had some stuff to sell (as pretty much all of the book's examples did), I would have been selling it already. One had huge piece of land, another one got a large stash of mattresses for free, yet another one is an architect that just does consulting instead of a regular job...<br /><br />Those are for small-time things, really small-time. Having nothing to do with real business building: just locating the stash of something cheap in one place, and helping to move it in space and time to another place where it could be sold with profit. That is all the advice this book has, really: I knew that, you knew that. Moving on.

0393330435|5.0|Seems like Woz is a nice guy.  An introvert that silently worked on the machines that made Apple a big company. The book is written by Mr. Wozniak himself.  I liked the fact that he shared his options to non-executive employees who did not get those incentives.  I also like the fact that the last chapter of the book talks about inspiration for aspiring inventors.  In my opinion, a great read.
B006OV7RQ4|3.0|While this film may be frustrating to more mainstream audiences, who demand resolutions to every conflict, I believe the more patient and tolerant film-goer will appreciate the slower pace and buildup. Trouble is, the buildup doesn't take you anywhere at all. Like the ending of the final episode of \\"The Sopranos\\" we're left with a (SPOILER ALERT!!!) fade to black that leaves it to the audience's imagination to fill in the blanks. If that doesn't bother you, then you'll probably love this movie. The acting by Olsen is sublime, and just like the curtain call on \\"The Sopranos\\" the ending to this movie is at least honest, if not satisfying. My main problem with the movie is, despite Olsen's brilliant performance, I felt little for her character beyond a frustrated annoyance. Anyone who allows a group of people to subvert who you are, to cut you off from everyone you've ever loved, to go so far as to change your name, well, that kind of weak individual gets little sympathy from this film-goer.
B0080SZ0V8|3.0|I actually bought this game thinking it was some sort of a maze/escape type.  However, I was happy to see that it was a combination of all sorts of puzzles.  I'm enjoying them all so far and have managed to complete all of them under the alloted amount of time.

B00DU74U74|3.0|This movie was very well made, but it was nowhere near as good as the book was.  I feel that if I had watched this movie before reading the book, I would have been discouraged from reading the book.  So my advice to all...please read the book!
B0070Y46UY|1.0|This has to be the WORST book I've read in years!  To tell you just how bad it was I never finished it, and I finish everything I read no matter how awful it is. But I read through 18 chapters of this book hoping that it would eventually get better, but it never did.  It only got progressively worse. If you love Indian zoos, zoology, and atheism, then by all means this is the book for you.  If not, PASS!!!!

Feel good story with action (had my boys hooked) and bright colors and a girl co-star (had the girls cued in)...best of both worlds - and lots of good but not corny ways of delivering main messages. Well worth it - only wish we had purchased it and not rented. Spend the extra money - its worth it!

B002RI9ORI|5.0|Bad Science is a great example of accessible, easy-to-read science. It's not preachy, the tone is never condescending, and the material seems to be pitched at an appropriate level for an intelligent lay reader. The best parts of the book are the underlying lessons about scientific methods. The examples are good, of course, but you go away with a much better idea of how to spot bad methods or dodgy claims, well beyond the individual cases that are cited in the book.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this to anyone who is struggling with the deluge of &#34;science&#34; in everyday life, or students who find scientific methods lectures a bit dry and need something more engaging to teach them the basics.

B00A285OOW|2.0|I've always been a fan of this author. In fact, I've read every book she's written about this era, but this book is a huge disappointment. Every chapter is a repetition of the one before; the long lost boy, Richard, has once again escaped the grips of the first, and inexperienced, King Tudor. All the while, Queen Elizabeth is painted as a completely ignorant pushover who falls in love with her ill tempered husband, who, historically, was actually mild-mannered and built a great fortune for the next generation of Tudor monarchs. It's almost as if 3/4's of the way through this book Gregory, herself, is tired of the story line and the could-be excitement falls perfectly flat. I'm really trying to push through to finish; let's hope I make it to the end.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game. Can't stop playing!!!  :-)  Totally a 5 star thing! Who doesn't love it. Best game ever!!!!!!!!!!!

1401235425|4.0|I like Batman, but the old series got so convoluted that it was very difficult for me to follow. I was excited to hear about the New 52 reboot of Batman, but when the original books were published I found it impossible to get them. So again I waited through the hardback until this more affordable paperback compilation edition came out.<br /><br />The artwork is magnificent. Never have I seen Batman more gritty and dark, and the use of the space on each glossy page is amazingly creative. The book starts with a quick bit to fill you in on the characters, and off we go. We find out that there is an ancient society running things behind the scenes in Gotham named the Court of Owls, and that they now are targeting Batman. The drawings are crammed with detail that perfectly convey the action and mood, and I spent much time going over them again and again picking up all the clues.<br /><br />The story is good, but it gets a bit far-fetched at times. I can swallow a lot, but I was especially put off by the way Batman handles the scene where he is trapped in the Maze. All I ask is for the writers to keep the story true and believable. I am hoping the next collection of issues, The City of Owls, will keep the integrity of the story in tact.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Love it! Great way to keep in touch and update friends and colleagues.  It's the new ticker tape, news-wire, etc.
0452273331|5.0|Most of the people who either tell you \\"The Fountainhead\\" is a must read or tell you not to bother seem to have an agenda. The best advice I can offer is to read it and decide for yourself. Individualism is, after all, one of the main messages of the book. Don't let others tell you what to think. Think for yourself.<br /><br />First, \\"The Fountainhead\\" is a great read. It is a compelling, vastly readable and entertaining novel. For years I was intimidated by it and its size, but my rule that great authors and great books will keep you interested and reading to the end regardless of length holds true here. It is the story of individualistic architect Howard Roark who refuses to compromise his integrity, designing and building amazing modern architecture while fighting the status quo of public opinion, manufactured and otherwise. There is a tremendously powerful and unconventional love story between Roark and the brilliant Dominique Francon that inspires great debate on its own. There are amazing characters and images that will stay with you forever. Mostly, though, \\"The Fountainhead\\" makes you think and, love it or hate it, this is always a good thing.<br /><br />At the heart of the Ayn Rand's novel is the theme of the individual versus the collective, \\"not in politics but within a man's soul.\\" It barely mentions politics, economics, or world affairs, even though it was published during WWII. Howard Roark at least partially sums it up by saying, \\"Don't work for my happiness, my brothers. Show me yours. Show me that it is possible. Show me your achievement, and the knowledge will give me courage for mine.\\" He doesn't help others out of the goodness of his heart. He strives to achieve his best in his chosen work, and that in turn inspires others to do their best.<br /><br />Roark thinks for himself, which threatens others who either seek the power to control others or who are merely content with being controlled. Ellsworth Toohey's speech to Peter Keating in part 4 of the novel sums up his view of this threat. \\"Can you rule a thinking man? We don't want any thinking men.\\" While rival architect Peter Keating's only sense of self-worth comes from the validation of others, Howard Roark's motivation and satisfaction comes from the inside, completely independent of what others think. Satisfaction comes from his work, not from what others think of his work. He keeps his integrity, through the good and bad. To do otherwise would destroy him.<br /><br />Many of the characters in \\"The Fountainhead\\" are said to be based in part on actual people. Howard Roark's buildings are based on the works of Frank Lloyd Wright, and many contemporary architects have cited the book as an inspiration to their own careers. Gail Wynand, the newspaper mogul of The Banner, reminds me of William Randolph Hurst. The book came out within a year of Orson Welles' classic film Citizen Kane, also said to be based on Hurst.

We don't want any thinking men.\\" While rival architect Peter Keating's only sense of self-worth comes from the validation of others, Howard Roark's motivation and satisfaction comes from the inside, completely independent of what others think. Satisfaction comes from his work, not from what others think of his work. He keeps his integrity, through the good and bad. To do otherwise would destroy him.<br /><br />Many of the characters in \\"The Fountainhead\\" are said to be based in part on actual people. Howard Roark's buildings are based on the works of Frank Lloyd Wright, and many contemporary architects have cited the book as an inspiration to their own careers. Gail Wynand, the newspaper mogul of The Banner, reminds me of William Randolph Hurst. The book came out within a year of Orson Welles' classic film Citizen Kane, also said to be based on Hurst.

B00A285OOW|4.0|Good flow and a typical chatty Phillipa Gregory, but there is too much repetition of the same story, although narrated from a different character is you read all of the books in the War of the Roses series - Red & White Queen and Red & White Princess. I'm a history buff though so I was tolerant of the repeated, intertwined stories.
B009ZW9DU2|5.0|This is a charming, well written book,about a cat and a young man who save one another and share a life of adventure in London. It has a happy ending unlike many animal books. I recommend it.
B008Y5QTRG|5.0|I watched this movie knowing nothing about it, so I had no expectations. That being said, I can't testify to its loyalty to the source material and it was impossible for me to be disappointed since I really wasn't expecting anything. It's rare to see a film like this with an R rating, and it's a hard R to be sure. I believe this gave the film makers the creative freedom needed to tell this story authentically, without having to compromise to achieve the PG-13. The casting is perfect, with each actor bringing his/her character to life. The action sequences are amazing, but so are the scenes that are dialogue driven. This film succeeds at everything it strives to be. The parts that are meant to be funny are funny, the action is done beautifully, and the serious parts really drive the story rather than slow it down. Everybody involved did an incredible job. Can't wait to see the sequel.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|fascinating, intriguing, empowering, i loved this book. how amazing she did the pct alone! i never had the balls! must read

B001D09OAI|5.0|I Love this movie! I've watched it since I was a kid. This movie is amazingly awesome. It's really funny.
B008JFUQZ2|5.0|I'll admit it -- I liked Michael Bay's first and third \\"Transformers\\" movies (the second has too many problems for me to enjoy).  Emphasis on LIKE there, as despite being a giant robot fan in general and a Transformers fan specifically, I do not LOVE the movies.  They're mindless dumb fun and something of a guilty pleasure for me, but the confused plots and subplots, unlikable human characters, unnecessary cheesecake shots, and sex and toilet humor drag them down.  I enjoyed watching the robots and the battle scenes, but still awaited the day when a GOOD giant mecha movie would hit cinemas and bring the jaw-dropping WOW factor I was looking for in the Transformers films but never quite found.<br /><br />\\"Pacific Rim\\" was that movie.  I went in knowing full-well what to expect -- two hours of stuff being destroyed and giant robots and monsters punching each other.  And this film not only did not disappoint, but it offered some much-appreciated elements Bay's films did not -- an actual coherent story, likable human characters, and most of all a heart behind its titanium exterior.<br /><br />A few years into the future, a rift opens on the ocean floor, admitting beasts from another world called Kaiju.  These monsters begin wreaking havoc along the world's coastlines, destroying cities and killing millions.  In response, humankind builds massive robots called Jaegers (pronounced yay-gers), piloted by teams of two or three who control the mecha with their minds, to combat them.  But the attacks are becoming more frequent... and more deadly, prompting the government to shut down the Jaeger program in favor of simply evacuating the coastlines and going strictly on the defensive.  In a last-ditch gamble, a retired Jaeger pilot assembles the last Jaeger teams together in Hong Kong, aiming to close the rift between worlds once and for all.  In the end, it may fall on a team-up between a cynical ex-pilot and a young rookie, as well as two bickering scientists, to save the world from a monster apocalypse...<br /><br />Perhaps this film's greatest strength is its special effects.  The robots are incredibly well-rendered and designed, to the point where its possible to forget you're watching CGI instead of actual mecha.  The Kaiju are imaginatively designed, evoking memories of the old Godzilla and Japanese-giant-monster movies while still having their own unique twists.  The settings are creative as well, with the gritty yet fascinating look of a cyberpunk landscape -- with the Bone Slums of Hong Kong and the Shatterdome base perhaps being the most memorable settings.  And of course, the action scenes are phenomenal, and will have viewers on the edge of their seats.  Because what's not to love about 250-foot titans duking it out in the ocean or in the heart of a city?<br /><br />To my surprise, there's actually a decent plot and characters to accompany the action scenes.  True, the save-the-world-from-alien-invaders isn't exactly new and does bring to mind [[ASIN:B0012HF5NC Independence Day]] at points, but here the stakes actually seem real.  I found myself actually caring about what happened to the characters, and feeling their terror and grief, their awe and apprehension, and even their joy and triumph.  The dynamics between the three main characters are believable and interesting, and the supporting cast brings their own brand of humor and humanity to the film as well.  Special props go to the two scientists (one a Kaiju-obsessed biologist and the other a grumpy mathematician who has to rein him in periodically) and to Ron Perlman's scenery-chewing cameo as a black-market Kaiju-parts dealer.  My one gripe is that I wish the other pilot teams could have been developed more -- the Chinese and Russian pilots are practically relegated to background characters, and the Australian pilots seem to serve as one-note rivals to the main characters.<br /><br />That, and this film leaves out the elements that I felt bogged down the \\"Transformers\\" films, and is all the better for it.  There's little to no potty humor or innuendo in the film, and the obligatory romance between the male and female leads is so downplayed as to be almost unnoticeable.  The film does focus more on the human characters than the robots, but given that these mecha aren't sentient like the Autobots, this is entirely understandable.<br /><br />If you're looking for something Oscar-worthy, or for a deep-thinking film that challenges your current set of beliefs, you'll probably be disappointed in \\"Pacific Rim.\\"  But if you just want to have fun for two hours and enjoy some titanic action scenes -- and especially if you're a fan of giant robots, mecha anime, and/or giant-monster movies -- this is a must-see.  It's easily one of the best summer blockbusters I've seen in a long time, and I'd gladly watch it again.ilms, and is all the better for it.

B0067QPVJ6|5.0|Let me start by saying, have you seen the other &#34;Things,&#34;  If you have, then, this is a treat for you, it is the Swedish part of the story, and what happended to them before the dog shooting incident on the way to the American camp.  I love Sci Fi stuff and when I saw this I was like AWESOME, I love when they take a story and come at it from different perspectives.  I would highly recommend this movie to Scifi and The Thing lovers alike, acting is good and the story line is well about The Thing 5 stars all the way around and a must see to bring the story line full circle.

B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I must say that this is the first Sylvia Day book that I've ever read that had a non ending.  In fact, this might be the first book that I've EVER read that just stopped.<br /><br />As I read the last page I was dumbfounded with how the author just stopped writing any additional pages.<br /><br />Yes, her writing of Gideon & Eva's obsessive sexual chemistry was great as usual and reading what happens after book 2 was good but that is about all that this book had going.<br /><br />This story spans a short period of time with no cliffhanger as a follow up.
B00480OHWK|5.0|Daughter absolutely loved it. Could not have pick a better book!!  I would definitely recommend this for your young child.
B005ES12H8|4.0|These crocs are light weight and have plenty of width.  The sizing is right on for length.  I like the deep soul and vents.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The first two books I read in the trilogy were paperbacks.  The final book I downloaded to my IPAD Kindle reader.  I very much enjoyed the Hunger Games story and liked the upbeat ending.  I have not seen the movie but want to see it now.

B001N9ESQ4|1.0|86 minutes that I will never get back.....very dry and monotone dialog. Was not impressed at all by either of the leads.
B0083GDLL8|4.0|I've just begun to explore Bowie's catalog and appreciate his music.  This is my favorite album so far.  The tracks are catchy, and the lyrics are very expressive and clever.  I highly recommend this for anyone who enjoys artists like Queen or who would like to be introduced to David Bowie's music.
B002C4YYEU|5.0|fantastic movie about a different life...very cool how it goes thru history. Forrest Gump fans will also love it GOOD MOVIE.
B00821OX98|5.0|Awesome video with suspense action and leaves you with a thrist for the next episode.  A must see for those who like sci-fi type movies.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I found it both a good idea and a cheap way for the studios to make money to have a munch of different individual comic book movies than bring them all together in this movie.<br /><br />Ever since X men studios have been jumping on any comic book idea for a movie they can get their ands on but Avengers is extremely well done with lots of characters to like.
B00000IQW5|5.0|I thought this was a great love story! I was not disappointed at all with this movie. My husband also liked it!

0316228583|2.0|I thought the language was too vulgar.  The book was not rated that I cpild see, and probably would not have purchased it if I had.  I'm not sure her purpose was for writing the book, except maybe don't  be a poor slob living in<br />a poor catholic neighborhood.
B009WUBERW|2.0|They spent more time making cameos and jokes about their careers Rather than trying to make a tired plot work.  I like them all and we know the whole theme is to place a bunch of our aging tough guys in some movies together, so dispense with the lame pokes at your careers.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Its awesome and helps kill time between classes. There is so much to do it just sucks having to wait so long for energy.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|We watched this entire series on PBS but wanter a friend to be able to &#34;catch up&#34; in it so we bought this for him.
B00EAH3GHI|5.0|to be honest - this is like a dream coming true. Christmas in September.<br />two decades of waiting, long 20 years(!)<br />and now for real: the legendary Seattle concert first time ever in a moderate quality and the entire set<br /><br />in fact this is the best recorded concert by Nirvana serving an unleashed rawness of sound combined with a good humored Cobain and the best location you may find.<br />(and thatswhy noone will miss \\"Teen Spirit\\" in the set, because this has been Cobain's way not do spoil the mainstream commerce and putting the focus on the sound he was always searching for)<br /><br />without a doubt: the climax of the Nirvana era<br /><br />so thanks MTV and Mrs Love for keeping it under surface for such a long time - \\"...the money will roll right in\\"
B001ECQ75A|5.0|So many great animated movies are coming out now--this is definitely one of the best--ditto for the 2nd Kung Fu Panda movie. Wonderful series on Nickelodeon too.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|This is a great devise to use in my car. I used it the other day for the first time and it worked great.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|This super-delightful animated movie manages to be poignant, thrilling and drop-dead funny too. Just brilliant. Great story, great characters (both human and animal).
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Just into a few chapters of the game, and the graphics are well-drawn, the characters are fairly one-dimensional but fun to interact with. The objects themselves are fairly easy to find and there are hints if you get stuck, shock comes in handy for the side games. Fun for a few minutes at a time.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|One of my all-time favorites (been a fan of animation since I was a kid)--one of the best &#34;villains&#34; ever--some terrific sly jokes in here for adults to laugh at too. Very humane and ultimately loving, satisfying story with lots of fun & thrills along the way. But really, a great one for all ages. And the &#34;minions&#34; are just too cute for words!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The writing is clever and the characters are engaging. I absolutely love Cousin Violet - she's my favorite. I would absolutely recommend this show
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|so fun just like temple run. so creative I got hooked beware the fart gun! minions are so funny. awesome
B00005J6T0|2.0|The album that heightened Madonna's career, or should I say the True Blue/Who's that Girl era. Listening to this album as an entire unit, there's nothing extra about it. It's 9 songs in length, and in my opinion the only interesting material are the three hits from it. Everything else is very lackluster, and has the quality of a demo tape. Had most of it been mastered and mixed into 'Pop-perfection', I believe the music would be just as great as the Artwork. This theory is proven with the 'You Can Dance' Edition of &#34;Where's the Party&#34;, same song, same rhythm, more layers, 100% better results. Pairing of the Who's that Girl soundtrack with True Blue creates a more memorable time in Madonna's career and supports one another in the fact that both releases are limited. Throw in the You Can Dance album to create a full set and experience this fascinating era as a whole.<br /><br />Off topic: this album cover is one of my favorites in music, It's a classic and makes an unforgettable statement.<br /><br />Sidenote: Where's the party (album version) sounds really awful.<br />Not because it's old but because the audio is not final.<br />Compare the You Can Dance version to this one;<br />The album version is disposable. There are many other<br />Songs recorded in the same time frame or earlier that<br />show better mastering. It's a poor quality edit.e familiar formula of Madonna. Side b opens up with Where's the party and ends the album with Love makes the world go round. This section of the album is more bubblegum and happy-go-lucky. Some of the same things that can be heard on Like a virgin.<br />The main letdown for this collection is not with the loss of musical direction but rather the lack of luster on side B thats much more prevalent on side A. The album begins to sound like leftovers from the Like a virgin sessions that didnt make the cut, or just stuff thst was recorded while messing around in the studio to initiate something with no agenda. It's as if side A was recorded after side B. One side revealing a metamorphosis and the other still in the initial fazes.<br />Overall, True Blue is \\"C\\" work. I believe if most of the detailing in this artwork were left to simmer awhile longer this project could've been above average.
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|I loved Khalid Hossieni's other books but this one didn't quite measure up in my mind. It started with tremendous potential but lost the plot somewhere along the way. Too much time was spent on a sub plot that could have been introduced in half a page and as a result the true story was diluted and didn't ever recover the momentum
B007FEFLTO|4.0|A long but enjoyable read. Follet makes a nice transition from Book One: 'Fall of Giants' and blends the stories and characters into this Book Two excellently. I would highly recommend this book.
B0051UH6W4|4.0|A very well written book that has a devastatingly sad story line and the story remains with you long after the book is finished
B008J34466|5.0|I'm not a pop music fan at all, and dislike most of what is on the radio today. That being said, I really like this CD. I've always been a fan of Pink and she does a good job here mixing various styles into some solid tracks. Definitely worth listening to.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Loved all the books , each one better than the last , definite read for all ages pretty much pg wish those ladies would get to writing a new book !
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Love this app.  It is so easy to use and the features are great.  I can access my books from different computers.
0062255657|5.0|I bought this book the day it came out and saved it until my flight home to Russia from the US. It was unintentionally the most perfect decision I could have made. Our trip was awful and we missed 3 of 4 connecting flights. I was stressed and tired by the time I started reading it in Heathrow. I loved it. I was worried because reviews were saying it was just like Coraline and I can see that comparison but it is so different and so much more. It's very much about childhood and how adults affect children and what it means to be an adult and to be a child. All of the uncertainty I was dealing with in running around airports was summed up in the line \\"Grown-ups don't look like grown-ups on the inside either...Truth is there aren't any grown-ups. Not one in the whole wide world.\\" Definitely made me cry on the airplane. :-)<br /><br />I thought it was an enchanting book and it reads very quickly and more cohesively than some of his other works. The dynamic between the boy and his father (especially when he has to sit inside a circle and his father comes to get him) is something that I think most people can relate to in some way or another. I thought the fleas and varmints were explained believably and were interesting. I found myself saddened by the ending but it also felt like the right ending. I would definitely say this is not a kids' book as there are some non-explicit \\"adult moments.\\"<br /><br />As far as my personal tastes go, I adore Neverwhere and Fragile Things. I don't care for Smoke and Mirrors and I thought American Gods was a great premise that got weighed down under a travel journal. I'm on the fence over The Graveyard Book since I liked the book but thought the ending was random and not really tied to the rest of the book. So that's where I'm coming from.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This book is wonderful but a little different from his first two books.  The first two centered on the same characters.  This book goes back and forth through different families through different time periods (in flashbacks).  But they are all interwoven.  Great writing and long-lasting story.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|to make it short:<br />the author doesn`t seem to be the smartest. just wanted to read a fictinal book one time a trusted the amazon score. big mistake. its bs.
0061438294|5.0|I agree with some of the reviews of lesser stars in that the facts here are common sense things, but I do not agree that they are.  If you are one of the few that has that 6th sense, it will confirm things you may have already deduced, however, many of the things the author points out are not of the common type and while accurate, the information is valuable and well presented.<br /><br />Points made on context, establishing a baseline etc. are extremely valuable and unless applied in a setting applicable to the ideals, will make no sense and do you no good, and may even cause you to publish a review lacking in the number of those 5-pointed golden symbols of acceptance and intuitive usefulness. So, it's a good, easy, quick read and very helpful.  However, if you are already a veteran field agent for some clandestine manifestation of truth extracting turbulence, you obviously won't enjoy it.  I did, and hence my presentation of the maximum measure of symbolic acceptance.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great story line with excellent characters.  I just wish we didn't have to wait so long for the next season!
0385523386|4.0|This was a very entertaining book to read.  It's not rocket science, nor is it boring fluff, just an enjoyable, entertaining book that really lets you see how things are in a (probably) typical women's federal prison.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Just got this for a Kindle. Big step up from the iPhone app. Much better playing experience. The problem is, I can't put it down.
0736083863|4.0|I like that the anatomy is specific to Pilates and targets the major muscle groups employed when properly executing the exercises.  It's limited to some of the basics and does not outline higher level equipment exercises.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Very gripping, superp acting and a well written drama. This is only episode 2 but it is a must see for those who like crime series.
1401937519|3.0|An interesting tale and a fast read.  It provoked me to learn more about the situation but, not an academic piece or necessarily well written.

The title song \\"Victim of Love\\" and the final track \\"Through the Storm\\" stand out as instant classics. The sheer heart, soul, and love that seeps from every corner of Charles voice will haunt you. Buy it now and never look back!
0679735259|5.0|No question... one of the best Vietnam Non-Fiction reads out there. If you're remotely interested in what the REAL side of combat is, check this book/audiobook out.
B005RDF2RG|3.0|Donkey shows perseverance and unconditional love and friendship. Lady Ogre learns to accept the beauty of who she really is and learns she can be loved for who she really is. Contains Eddie Murphy's typical quick wit & humor. Good quality animation but too much language for me to want to see again.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a great game and as all good games are, very addicting. I love the way the coins increase to play with as the levels go up.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Good example of a mean person having a change of heart to love people he once despised and used. Minions are cute but exhibit a lot of violence toward each other but show unconditional support for the main character. No cussing or using God's name in vain.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Such a well written book. Great vacation read. Finished it in less than two days. Couldn't wait to find out what happens next. And then didn't want it to end!
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Good read, light and easy, no stress if your interrupted by the real world and have to put it down. Enough details in the right places to keep you interested without getting laborious and boring...makes you want to stop what your doing to see what they get up to next.
B00785P2QC|5.0|love it its a sweet twist on a Sim city remake ...and u can play it with out cash is sweet.give it a try well worth the download
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Got bored with this after the first book.  The same story over and over. I guess some may like it more.
B008AUGEFC|5.0|I absolutely adored this book. Mitchell really is a master of story and genre, and he handled this imaginative tale with remarkable craft. The book isn't for everyone, as it is split up into six different stories spread across time that are all connected to each other. It takes patience at first, but if you are looking for a book in which to lose yourself and finish feeling elated and overwhelmed, give this a try. It quickly became one of my all time favorite books, and it is one I will most definitely read again.
B004RKXNDU|5.0|Quite  suspenseful story.  Read the book after seeing the movie.  Definitely like the book better than the movie in this case.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|I viewed this film before reading the novel or knowing anything about the story, and fell in love with it. I kept an open mind and had no expectations, and wound up loving the movie. After watching, I immediately ordered the book and devoured it, simply because I couldn't get enough of these characters or the unique way in which this tale is crafted. The film is not without faults, however it is one I plan to watch many more times as it took me on a journey that I will not easily tire of. If you're having a night in and want to watch a movie that will make you think and feel abundantly, I highly recommend Cloud Atlas.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Good game to keep going back to when energy has rebuilt again,good playing away spare time,could do with more energy as sometimes you can only do two tasks then have to wait to refill again
0141345659|4.0|After seeing this book on the shelves of bookstores and various friends' houses, and hearing so much about John Green but not having read his work before, I decided to give this a try. I browsed the first few pages using the Amazon &#34;Look Inside&#34; feature, and was roped in immediately. Once I received the book and dove in, I couldn't put it down and finished in almost one sitting. I will not say that it is the best book I ever read, or that John Green is now my favorite author, but I did enjoy this story. I became very attached to the characters and their endeavors, and even shed more than a few tears at various points in the book.<br /><br />I will say that while Green is talented and has a distinguished literary voice, I still think that there are elements of his work that can be sharpened up; for instance, there were times I found the characters, their actions, and dialogue less-than-believable. Overall, however, this is a good, quick read that will take you on a gratifying journey. It's also great if you need a good cry.
B008LXZFH6|5.0|Great Ferrell vehicle, and all the lead actors are hilarious as well.  Humor keep coming through the whole movie without lags.  And, the awkward moments are many and short between.  If you like Will Farrell, you'll love this movie because it's quintessential.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|I watched this with a few friends after we had read countless reviews of this film, and while I loved it, many of my friends didn't care for it. If you are unfamiliar with Tarantino's work, be prepared for a distinct style with a good deal of gore. Some would call it gratuitous, others artful and stylistic. I did enjoy this movie. It caused me to laugh until I cried as well as to cringe in horror. Know what you are getting into before watching the film, and you might like it as well as I did.
1432794426|5.0|I don't often feel connected to Authors and their books, however Karen has the ability to write from her heart with empathy and compassion and most of all love. Karen has the ability to make me feel closer to Michael.<br />I thank her so much for that xx<br />Lots of love to you xxxxx
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|It's a pretty good game, interesting, different levels and achievements to gain. Keeps you interested. I would recommend this :) good for when I have a bit of spare time waiting to meet up with someone or something
B000L53D4O|4.0|My baby grand loves the bright colors. We haven't figured out a way to use it upright on these tile floors, though. She loves the rolling ball in the middle, and the flippers at the bottom. She's still trying to learn to turn the spinner, and isn't interested in the rest. I wish it came with something to put on the wheels to make them less slippery on hard surfaces.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The picture is none like I've seen before and it looks like the real minions from the movie. Very addictive and I would recommend it to every age. I know I liked the game.
B008JFLWLE|5.0|I use it mainly to help my kids with their math homework, but my wife uses it for her college level math classes as well. it works smoothly!
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|Ok if I had to say anything why kill the dog... other than that it's a great book<br />Love it!!!
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|This book has a great story with a unique ending - it's definitely a slow starter but keep with it<br />and you'll have a bunch of different feelings towards the end.
B000FBFN0Q|5.0|The book is very funny and quirky. I love how Sophie Kinsella wrote the characters of Rebecca and Luke. It made me excited to know what will happen to their lives after. I kinda relate to Rebecca's dilemma with all the shopping and credit card bills. hehe. I wish all my bills can be solved too like Becca hahaha. I can't wait to read all her other books :)
B0091REZMW|3.0|I hate the limited time you can play, I hate how you have to \\"pay\\" to banish, unlock rooms... etc.
B006BAEQB2|3.0|From reading parts of Gregory's non-fiction essays I understand some of the hardships of trying to stay true to the history while writing fictional accounts, but I think she's trying to stuff too much history and not enough of the character development and motivation.  It was also confusing as I had not read the first two books, so maybe I missed some of the motivations of the characters.  But I did find it an interesting way to add to my English history knowledge.  However, I would recommend highly starting at the beginning of the series to follow it along.
B005SAP45I|3.0|Cars 2 is fun for the kids- as an adult I definitely would say Cars 1 is the better of the twop.
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|I found this movie extremely boring. It felt like nothing ever happened. I ended up turning it off. Not at all what I expected from a sci-fi Tom Cruise movie.
B00AQL8VU4|4.0|Seems to do everything Amazon does on the computer.  Haven't used it much yet, but is easy to use. Still trying to find the Video Library.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|3 stars because it supports very less apps from smart devices. good product otherwise. Another thing is it is slow even over fast internet.<br /><br />I have Roku player that is way better in terms of number of channels.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great little game.  Started off too easy and ended too quickly. Perfect for that pesky airport layover. I could enjoy this game for hours if only there were more rooms.
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|Watched it the first time on a borrowed DVD.  Bought two new DVD's the next day.<br />We have watched it twice since then.<br /><br />Great performances, great memories.  This DVD will get a lot of use.<br />We highly recommend it.
1616551607|5.0|This is one of the best presents I have ever received and it is thanks to my lovely girlfriend that I love so much that I have it. Yoshitaka Amano is one of my favorite artists of all time and for MANY years I have wanted some form of complete collection for his work on Final Fantasy. He's been drawing for Final Fantasy since its inception in 1987 and to have all that art in my possession was a dream up until now.<br /><br />This particular set ranges from the original Final Fantasy up until Final Fantasy X which for me is the perfect cut off despite their being games released after. I would have been happy if it ended at VI seeing as that was the last Final Fantasy game where Amano truly had almost complete design and creative control with his artwork (though he did majorly contribute to FFXI).<br /><br />Since FFVII, Amano often handles just the logos for the series as his main duties have been given to Tetsuya Nomura (whom I'm hoping has his own collection someday soon alongside Akihiko Yoshida, the artist for all the Ivalice world games and the Ogre series) since FFVII (with the exception of FFIX, FFXI and FFXII). So, everything else is just a bonus to me.<br /><br />I was expecting cardboard slide outs like I'm sure almost everyone who was anticipating this collection was since, it was advertised as a slip case edition in its order title. But no, this to my surprise and absolute delight is a VERY high quality set and easily one of the best I have seen. The fact it was at a price far lower than what you'd expect a set like this in such quality is almost unbelievable.<br /><br />There is the main box that contains the three hardcover artbooks and acts almost like a huge chest. The box has a hinged lid and has a tassel that easily opens it. The material going all around it is satin textured which shields damage and absorbs force as well as looks and feels nice. The art is even in the satin material going all the way around it inside and out which is REALLY nice.<br /><br />The three hardcover books are HUGE and loaded with pages and beautiful art. The pages have a nice texture and thickness hat doesn't feel like it's too thick or hard to turn the pages. The front of each book has the artwork of Amano with their number ranging from 1-3 on the front with additional artwork of Amano's on the back. When all the books are inside the case you have a noticeably heavy thing to hold. You can legitimately use it as a weight. I am just blown away by how high quality this entire set is. I was NOT expecting this at all. Worth it even at twice the price the one I received was.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|The retro dance feel of the song is very contagious. She definitely deserves the applause and I'm looking forward to hearing the rest of the cd after it comes out.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I was looking for free apps for my Kindle and came across this Solitare game. It is great. I find it very relaxing! It has a feature that lets you play with other players. Addictive!

B004O4K4SQ|5.0|very colorful, great weapons.  simplistic design.  the game has three sets of levels that.progressively harder.  very well done and done well
B0084AXZK0|3.0|Kinda dry at times. And also there were parts where I wanted to shout  GET ON WITH IT! A true classic though.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Have had so much fun playing this. Was simple enough for my four year old to play. I've also had fun myself.

B006LSZECO|1.0|This book was such a waste of time and money. I hoped the plot would get better, but no....it kept getting worse!<br />Just read the synopsis on Wikipedia or some spoiler website and call it a day.
B0038ZITIE|5.0|Great movie. I love the color and the actors costumes in this movie plus the excellent sound track of Queen

B0088W2GOA|5.0|StarGate Plot ,,,,,,,,,I watched SG1 a long time ago not the whole series but a few episodes i liked it a lot ,,,,,,so i gave Stargate Universe a try ,,,,very good show but only had 2 sessions ,whith a great script that could have made more it was a shame that it did not go any further the last episode on session 2 of Universe ,it had a very good ending very touching ,so i had to have more and Sg1 was i little old for me i know how it ends so that kinda kills that series for me so i tried Atlantis ,I am very surprised on its plot way different then both the ether shows but keeps the some type of construction.I also like that the actors in both shows,Some have went on to shows that are on now like Supernatural on so on .((((( on the  episode when they land and he say's ok now remember wear we parked very funny that was a line from Star Trek IV - The Voyage Home my favert movie i could not stop laughing when this show sed it . so i love it mmmm i will wright again after i finish all the sessions =)
0307730700|5.0|Awesome book about a guy where everything goes against him yet he prevails.  Not just a story of a Navy Seal but a dad and a family and how they come together.  Best book I have read in a long time.  I have also bought three copies for my family.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|It is really fun. I would recommend it to anyone who likes the marines and Army. If you do choose to play it, which I hope you do, be patient with the tips.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Great start to the series highly recommend it. It did have its ups and downs but that is usually a first book getting you read with the characters. Good read
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This game is amazing. Not too much blood and Gore. And if you like Boulders Gate or Beatle the Bard, GET THIS GAME!!!!!
B0098460O4|5.0|Jonathan and Charlotte compliment each others musical talents in singing some of the most powerful and forever classics ever created.  These two young people are at the top of their game and can sing next to the greats any day. Two thumbs way up for these two super talented youths.
B008JFUNWS|3.0|and it's the fault of that demigod-d*mn cast!<br /><br />Here we go: a great movie with lots of fun, a great score, gorgeous over-the-top gimmicks such as misty taxis, talking serpents, cute cyclop half-brothers, marvellous fairy-tale creatures... you feel like being back in 2002, when the second Harry Potter film was released... the adventure is just to begin...<br /><br />But what are these twenty-something-year-olds doing in our movie? Don't get me wrong. Logan Lerman is a gorgeous actor... in a young-adult coming-of-age story like \\"The Perks of Being A Wallflower\\" involving sex, drugs and rock'n'roll...Alex Daddario is great as a horror scream-queen as in \\"Texas Chainsaw\\"...and Brandon T. Jackson is a great comedian. But NONE of them belong in this film series.<br /><br />I know, it's the fault of the first movie, but they could have recast the kids and retconed the series instead of screwing up the entire series for good. We all know what made The Neverending Story, Harry Potter and The Chronicles of Narnia into great movies... they stayed true to its source material, getting the age of the characters right! Even adults love good children's films, but not at all such travesties that try to be both at the same time: children's fairy-tales disguised as young-adult comedy - Twilight-aged actors playing Harry Potter and the Golden Fleece...<br /><br />It simply couldn't work out and this time, the box office numbers show the true scale of Chris Columbus' lack of foresight back in 2010... Why on Mount Olympus did he do that? He who gave us Harry P., Home Alone and Mrs. Doubtfire? He was the chosen one to turn this great book series into the next Harry Potter... Instead he destroyed not only these films but also the original books series for those actors will always haunt our mental projections of these characters... The single-most worst mistake in the history of movie-making...
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|In my personal opinion, I would say this is one of their better albums. It sounds like they went old-school, with a few new school touches. I would def. say top 3, with Millennium and Black and Blue at the top two spots.
0307588378|5.0|If you like mysteries at all, you will likely be intrigued by this one, which is also a portrait of a disintegrating marriage between 2 ill-matched people.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's a great game and I play it all the time and my sister plays it alot too<br />It's awesome and I love it
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Cannot wait for season 4! Watched all 3 seasons in a row & now can't wait until January 5, 2014 on PBS

B007L96VCY|5.0|Not only did this CD bring me back to my original hearing (vinyl) of this album, but from the perspective of years I can see the power in McCartney's attempt to priveledge family, home, fun, and the earth in this work.
B008OOYALE|5.0|My husband and I play together, I think the only downfall for me is that the game never lets me send gold to friends. Always says I have already sent or they have already received there max gifts for the day.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|A great documentary on rock and roll and recording history.  The period when digital technology overtook analog, and I'm my opinion, recordings lost their soul. Dave Grohl does a great job, and does his part to keep analog alive. This is s must-see for fans of rock and roll history.
B00003CXPD|5.0|This is a classic family movie with a modern twist as it brings current events to life with classical ballet
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|At the beginning of the book, i wasn't interested in the book. But once i got to the middle of the book it was really good! The ending was fantastic too!
B008JFUUIA|5.0|It's mean girls meets glee in this 2012 musical comedy. Can't bet much better than having great commentary of the accapella competition either.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|MTG has always been a favorite of mine and this game compliments the great aspects of the game. although I would like more flexibility on decks it really gets the essence of the game.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great way to bring the books to life. Jennifer is Katniss that's for sure, she really made me believe it was real
B00BY8DIT2|5.0|what can i say. beth and joe r a match  made in the stars. Beth's soul and joe's power guitar is amazing. hope they do another album together
B000FC1MCS|5.0|This book is so well done! Haddon's books are a little quirky, which I love, but this one takes the reader inside the head of a young man who lives with autism, as he investigates and writes about a murder in his neighborhood. Most of us have very little understanding about autism, even if we know someone with the disease. I won't say Haddon is an expert in the field, but this book certainly gave me much food for thought, and insight into the things a person with autism might find disturbing and react very differently than what we might expect.

B003FVI2KQ|2.0|For the money, I should've purchased the new 8 core.  This processor isn't very fast even after overclocked to the max at 4013.7MHz with software assist.  Not a drop more or it will crash.  Stick with newer processors.
B000P0J0A6|4.0|So cool to watch this after so many years. Kids thought it was more humorous than scary, but still a classic none-the-less!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|The movie has incredible landscapes. It shows the greediness of men that are not concerned about local people life. They are only interested in obtain a kind of metal that will give them the energy they need.
B005544V6A|5.0|I love this show...I did not watch during the initial season but am now hooked. I love the wit and mental battles.
B00CWVBTUU|4.0|If you have kids this is a great movie.  If your kids love Lego, this is a must rent or buy.  Also, it adds more footage that is not available when playing the Lego Batman 2 game.
B007C94XG4|5.0|The kids and i loved it!<br />Great quality in the comfort of our own home. Enjoying our homemade popcorn! YUM!!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Such a funny and delightful read.  Fey is a true comedian.  I just wish 30 rock was still on. Blurgg!
B000FCK8ZK|5.0|This book was everything I could have imagined and more.  For true dexter fans it is a must read just be prepared to give up a day or two because you won't put it down and it will shock you.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Excellent in all categories - will enjoy watching again and again - can't wait for season four!! One of the best shows on TV.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|Good way to pass time when I'm bored.  Still easy to put down, though.  Whether that's a good thing or not depends on who you ask.. hah.
B008J34466|5.0|I love almost anything from this artist so I think this album is great. It contains many of her current hits.

B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I love Bruno Mars' music and this album is no exception. Many of his biggest hits are on it, and I was very impressed that he has a writing credit on each and every song. This man is talented!
B00354YA2M|4.0|I lived in Australia for a while and can honestly say that it really made me laugh! the kind of laugh that people around you think you are mad...<br />At the end it became a bit monotonous but all in all a very enjoyable and funny book!
B0050VA428|4.0|It's started out a little slow but end the end I couldn't put it down in the end! 5 star's
B007AL48UK|5.0|LIKE IT MAKES YOUR BRAIN WORK AND KEEPS YOU ACTIVE I HAPPEN TO LIKE MAJHONG TILE GAMES ESPECIALLY ON MY KINDLE!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It is fun, addictive game.  Graphics are great.  BUT it is a time zapper.  This is the first Temple Run game I've tried and I like it.
B000R7HY0K|3.0|Basically it's  like hanging out with your sister and 7 of her friends while they talk about guys and weed and partying....It was ok though overall for the chase scenes and it ends in kind of a quick, weird way.
B0058YPL66|5.0|The series was watched on tv from my teen daughter.  she made me watch her grandmothers discs while at camp.  We became the dvd bandits from grammies camper to ours.  It is interesting story line.  I had to order the complete second season and anxious to see the second season.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|so, so sweet! just enough sarcasm to compliment the cheesy romance of young love. fills you with memories of whoever it was that you got all googly eyed over and thought it would last forever... and memories of when you realized it wouldn't... and then makes you realize that in a way it kinda does last forever because you never fully forget.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I think the book is not one of her best.  I didn't think it is<br />well written and the story line is poor. I would not recommend<br />the book
B006LSZECO|4.0|Keep me reading, the ending was abrupt. The characters were great. The story had lots of twist an turns and kept you guessing.
B004J4XGN6|3.0|It has some very good points; however it does not go into real life challenges and how the corporate world cut through to implement a start-up kind of environment. Good read and very good points; I would recommend senior managers and decision makers in corporate world to read this book so they can bring in efficiencies at work-place
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the best game out there.  It seriously has this quality of 10$ game and lucky for people like me it is free!  Despicable Me fans have to buy you will love it.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|This was by far the most awesome puzzle I have encountered. Love the mind tricks to make you think harder.
140006922X|5.0|This book is absolutely ground breaking in that a Muslim scholar writing on the subject of Jesus. Reza Aslan clearly admires, is intrigued by, and is very impressed by this man called Jesus. The idea that Jesus was a revolutionary is not new in literary themes of study. That a Muslim dared write on a subject he clearly knows and loves, is new....hooray! The book is fascinatingly written and compels the reader to take a look at this extraordinary man in the geo-political context of his time. The 1 star ratings certainly were not from people who had read the book. I've given this book to several 'agnostics' who became very interested about just who Jesus was. I recommend this book to anybody who wants to expand their view of Jesus, and of history.
B00A285OOW|5.0|I am fascinated by Tudor England and the War of the Roses.  Philippa Gregory is by far my favorite author on the time period.  I thought this book was great and enjoyed the story of Elizabeth of York and Henry VII.
B00B5QGPZC|5.0|What can I say about David Garrett that has not already been said. He is one of the greatest violinists every walked this earth. Every one of his CD's or DVD's that I have purchased has been outstanding. Wish he came to San Diego more often.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|It's not perfect - I could wish for fewer ads, for instance, but it's accurate and easy to use.  I keep hoping for a premium version one day.
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|they put out an excellent album once again! catchy upbeat tunes that are easy to listen to and put you in a good mood.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a very good game but it's to much money<br />But it's still a very good game<br />I recommend this game but is still should a like at least $3.99
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|...on the other worlds. I enjoyed the unique characteristics and can't wait to start the next book. Couldn't put this one down!
0446541478|4.0|I had fun reading and learning how Israel has become a leader in the world in Hi Tech development.<br />The book is interesting , but it repeats a lot of things.<br /><br />It is worth reading it
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I'm a big fan of Game of Thrones the tv series. And the books are even more amazing! I love it
0143038583|4.0|Michale Pollan has a knack for revealing information I'm not at all sure I wanted to know. As a rabid omnivore, even after reading this book, I'll no longer be so cavalier tracing the food aisles of the grocery, be it a neighborhood convenience store, a Whole Foods, or any other big-box food mart. In an age of mistrust in almost all institutions, discovering that there's reason to be skeptical about the trend of our food sources is more than unsettling; it's disturbing. Pollan traces his four meals as meticulously as possible, from their absolute source to a table. In doing so with both so called organic and industrial suppliers, he roots out every possible aspect of those menu choices, the content, farming, energy involvement, land-care and/or depredation, nutritional content, pricing considerations (including externalities) and even the food's own evolutionary adaptations that makes it available and helpful to us (or not) as consumers. This is, in typical Pollan fashion, an almost painfully researched (and very well crafted) book that is guaranteed to make any reader look more closely at what they eat, what its true cost is, and who the true benefactor of whatever that reader pays for that food is. The only critique I had of the work is something not under Mr. Pollan's control, and again, I'm not sure I wanted details anyway. What does happen behind the walls of those abattoirs from which our industrial beef proceeds? Why do those companies keep their customers in the dark about what they do there? This mystery by itself ought to stop us from consuming their product.<br />Byron Edgington, author of [[ASIN:1622490371 The Sky Behind Me: A Memoir of Flying & Life]]
B00D5O7BPU|4.0|Good, interesting concept. Done well. Not 100% sure what too do with it though. Fun for awhile but lacks much replay.Worth the 99&copy; us pay for it I`'ll admitted.
B0085YOD1A|4.0|It was just nice to see that when my battery was low, that you could see it immediately! Just nice to have around
B004ZG5EYC|5.0|What a great movie.  Perfect for those who felt odd, strange, not popular, outside the main stream.  Funny as all get out.  Really enjoyed the GREAT cinematography. Possibly one of my favorite fun movies!  Just watched it again, some 11 years later, and just as fun as when I first saw it.
B00BMR5HOO|4.0|I liked having this app on my kindle. The print was large enough so that I didn't need to squint.
0312427573|4.0|The first Thomas Wolfe novel I read was A Man in Full and I enjoyed it immensely.  I've followed up with each subsequent novel he has published (I Am Charlotte Simmons and Back to Blood) and The Right Stuff is simply one my favorite books of all time.  To date, I've never been disappointed by one of Wolfe's efforts.  It occurred to me that there were several highly regarded Wolfe novels that pre-dated my discovery of his work, so I ordered this novel, along with The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test.<br /><br />The Bonfire of the Vanities, written in the mid-80s, is a perfect satire of the melting pot that is New York City.  No ethnic community is spared Wolfe's biting commentary, from the African-American \\"Reverend\\" racial huckster, to the Irish cops and DAs, to the novels chief protagonist, bond trading WASP Sherman McCoy and his high society running buddies.  Wolfe is in fine form while spinning this yarn about racial politics and the skewed criminal justice system that is heavily impacted by it.<br /><br />Wolfe is never better than when he crawls into the mind of some of his most colorful characters, and Sherman McCoy is no exception.  I would certainly rate this as one of his better efforts, though not quite up to the standards of The Right Stuff.

1250012570|4.0|Eleanor and Park is one of those books that EVERYONE in the book community has heard about. Everyone was reading it and everyone was loving it, and all I needed to hear were the buzz words; true love and punk rock to make me want to read this.<br /><br />Park may be one of my favorite guy characters of all time, no really, he's so charming and whitty, and I loved everything about his character, he was definitely worthy of some swoon in my opinion.<br /><br />Now lets talk about Eleanor, She drove me NUTS! I wanted to like her I really did, esp. because she had such a troubled home life, on top of constantly being picked on in school, but her self-doubt, low self-esteem, and under-rudeness towards Park ate away at me. I honestly couldn't see why Park was so in love with her, esp. when Eleanor couldn't even say it back to him.<br /><br />I loved the conversations between them though, and I thought the dialogue was truly a work of art!! The ending with the postcard ruined that \\"true love\\" element for me though, and I would totally be able to enjoy their relationship as purely a friendship, because honestly I felt like their love relationship was very onsided with Park doing all the courting and the work and it felt a bit unauthentic to me.<br /><br />I can definitely see the appeal with this book, and I did enjoy it, but Eleanor ruined it a bit for me, and upon talking to some book blogger friends we have very similar feelings where that goes, so it's nice to know that I'm not totally alone in this..
B0093Q8W0C|2.0|Everyone says this is one of Hitchcock's best.  Don't believe it.  Plot is contrived, the scenes at Mt Rushmore made me giggle rather than feel fear and empathy, and Grant's performance was stiff and unbelievable.  Whole experience was a disappointment.  I remembered it as less-than-vintage Hitchcock, but years later it seemed merely overrated.
B00919CI5Q|5.0|After doing a bit of research, this seemed like the most capable card I could get without having to upgrade my power supply. I've had no real problems so far with this in my Dell XPS 8300 with a 460 watt power supply. I'm really impressed by how quiet it its.<br /><br />Games I've tried at 1080p with vsync enabled include<br /><br />SimCity<br />Civilization V<br />Sims 3<br />Magic the Gathering 2014<br />Tropico 4<br />Skyrim<br /><br />These all look great at max or near max settings with framerates seldom dropping below 60 fps.<br /><br />It's nearly silent even while gaming and I haven't logged a temperature above 60 C.<br /><br />A slight issue is that when connected to your monitor via HDMI it doesn't send full RGB, it sends 16-235 instead of 0-255. The result is bad black levels and everything looking washed out. I spent way too long trying to calibrate my monitor before figuring out what was wrong. Apparently this is not an issue with a DVI connection and is an Nvidia driver issue rather than something specific to this card. Since I don't have a DVI cable, I searched online found a program which modifies settings in the registry so that the full 0-255 is used. It works for me, but use at your own risk. It's probably better to plan on using DVI.<br /><br />This card registers a 7.8 for me on the Windows Experience Index for Windows 8. Others have reported a 7.9, so I'm guessing my PCI Express 2.0 slot is holding it back a bit.
B00571F26Y|4.0|As a nurse, the info in this book is very thought provoking and makes a lot of sense. I have needed to lose weight and this gave me an effective tool to use. I have lost 25 pounds in 6 weeks!!! It can, however, be a tough read as it includes a lot of scientific jargon that can be boring at times!
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Great book.  Love the information and how its presented.  You need to decide how to use it.  She is very easy to understand and the message she is conveying.  It is a little different from the standard &#34;new age&#34; info, but it can really tie somethings together.  Love the book.  Would buy it again.
B0087GZ8YW|4.0|Very enjoyable return for Rebus and co. Perhaps not the best in the series but bloody good anyway. Buy it.
B00CDXOXB4|3.0|I might have enjoyed the movie more if I hadn't read the book.  Like most cases the book is so much better.  Why did they change Kristen's name to Lexie?  I wish they would've spent more time showing conversations between Katie and Jo. The movie doesn't reflect the close friendship they actually had.  I also wish they would have spent more time on Katie's history with her husband, or at least shown him at work and how he functioned more.  Would have shown the viewer the sociopath he really is.  I also didn't like that they were intimate (slept together) in the movie.  They didn't in the book, which really explains the delicacy in Katie and Alex as people, he still getting over his wife and she being able to let a man touch her like that again.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|What's not to love?  The Zombie apocalypse is always great drama!  Excellent cast and writing, great special effects and really scary Zombies to boot.....
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The best show of this century, wish I could give it a hundred stars. Great story, even better acting, pull out your tissues this season.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|when I went to click on the stuff at the bottom it wouldn't work so there for it stinks like dog poo
B0036S4B6M|5.0|This was an awesome read. This book took you into the lives of women in jail and showed how they survived each day.
B0083Z614S|5.0|My husband was a bit surprised if not aghast that I had never read this classic. On a bit if a dare I decided to and I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />To \\"watch\\" the wonderful physical and emotional transformations of Mary, Colin and the others is worth the time to read this heart touching book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's a fun game, but I am not to keen on having to buy things with real money... these type of games I tend to not play.. but after giving it some rounds have found myself stuck... hope to get to the end soon
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is very entertaining and interesting! I have been playing it for hours, I don't want to put it down.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|This was a well written book that kept you entertained.  Interesting, fast paced, story with plenty of twists to keep you going.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|The plot wasn't all that original and it wasn't hard to foresee the twists. I found the story too be too much like Moon starring Sam Rockwell so it wasn't very fresh. Great movie for a temporary diversion, but nothing to contemplate and carry with you after watching.
B005HT400A|5.0|awesome this was a real good purchase .  thanks for the  extra effort this was great the picture looks good
B00BR5G37G|5.0|This book will open the door to communication for any leader trying to change the culture of their organization. It's simple, effective, and easy to read. The amazing thing about this book is how it teaches you (and your team) how to recognize the meaning of the language that everyone uses and quickly determine their level of commitment to the team effort. IT'S SIMPLY TRUE!<br /><br />The power of the book lies in the way it helps the reader better understand the reasons we choose the words we do to express ourselves. Leaders quickly learn to change their speaking habits which will immediately create greater influence on the team and also, helps them easily identify non-productive members of the team. I highly recommend this book for any organization or company.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|this is a great show. I do not recommend this show to anyone who gets query at the sight of blood and violence. but it is a thrilling and intense show. I also recommend starting at the beginning with the first season to really understand what is going on.
0767811070|5.0|Loved the product, accurately described, great to add to any collection and would buy again if for some reason I lost it!
B00B8YSIMY|5.0|Get Clean by Jams N. Roses is a very powerful read and I found the violence, sex and language are realistic with the world that James finds himself in. There really are no true friends in the drug world no matter how far you travel. This story is thrilling and I found it to be fast paced and relatable. With the lure of money, sex, and drugs will James be able to save himself from falling further?<br />It's drug addiction, sex and violence, witty and dark and I found it a fantastic read.
B0001Z53CY|5.0|Loved the product, accurately described, great to add to any collection and would buy again if for some reason I lost it!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I ordered a while back, but recently begin playing. Now it's hard to not play and try increasing my score. Love it!
B008JFUPK8|1.0|[UPDATE 10/2013: MANY have given me crap claiming NOLAN had NOTHING to do with the telling of this latest Superman tale. While I disagree that one coming off a very successful run of the BATMAN franchise, which the next installment of this Superman is allegedly going to merge with won't sit on the sidelines, to shut those people up let me say this has a very NOLAN-ISH vibe to the drawn out storytelling, which BTW tends to be almost be a 75 percent rip-off of Lion King only that at least moved and flowed better. So the bottom-line is someone really BORROWED Nolan's long-winded style as well as darkness in telling this latest Superman tale and I MAINTAIN it was Nolan!]<br /><br />While Nolan certainly brought the \\"dark\\" back into Batman and kudos for that (even though nothing will top the 1989 Keaton/Nicholson movie)Nolan so over-tells the damn story to death. Each of his Batman trilogies gets worse and worse in that regard since apparently no one puts him on a leash! For those that found that aspect...most notably in the third and final Dark Knight saga....he takes that even farther on this Superman flick! DEAR GOD!!! Nolan can take a scene of a kid picking up a rock and drag it out 15 minutes! While I was curious with this latest reboot of Superman going dark I think Nolan's slow pace destroyed it and all I came away from after watching it was near 3 hours of my life I'll never get back! Beware and if you MUST HAVE wait 6 months after it comes out and get it for a $1.00!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I got this app for my daughter and she loves it. She had horses. very life like. She's only six v and could do it.
B001KX50BK|4.0|It is an early Roberts film but it shows all the signs of the good actor she has become.  The scene following their outing to the polo club is quite revealing.  It shows a depth of emotion you may not expect from somebody that young.  Overall it is an entertaining story and the film is worth owning.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show! Very clean and addicting!! Just wish it was easier to find and watch other than just online sources.
B00APKIN1I|5.0|I stumbled upon the Sound City documentary yesterday while browsing through video streaming on Amazon Prime and watched it twice.  i was never a fan of Rick Springfield, Paul McCartney or some of the other musicians featured in the film, but now Im a true believer.  I bought and downloaded the soundtrack right away and have been playing it ever since.  Favorites include:  Man That Never Was, Mantra and Cut Me Some Slack.  I love this album so much, Im researching the music of the artists who appear on it.  Dave Grohl is a genius!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Gives alot of information about the which even we don't know and they give us the information which we need
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|i enjoyed this book for the most part. It had a bit of a lull in the middle, but the ending was exciting
1416955070|2.0|I picked this book up because I see a movie's coming out, and I teach teenagers. It's something I have always liked to have in common with them - the ability to talk about the fiction they like.<br /><br />It all started falling apart around Twilight. Oh my goodness I hated that book series. I wanted to whap that Bella chick from page one.<br /><br />I felt the same about Clary Fray. I mean, she talks to her mom on the phone. Sounds of mayhem are in the background. Mom screams \\"don't come here! Run!\\" So what does the moron do? she goes to her mom.<br /><br />She's also whiney and mopey and a typical emo teenager and I want to whap her.<br /><br />Most of the other characters seemed vaguely familiar, and it wasn't until I read that she's a fanfic writer that I can see what she's done. Another reviewer said that it's Harry Potter redone, and I can see some of that. But. I would state that there's a lot of Twilight here too. Clary is Bella. But Isabelle is Alice and Rosalie rolled up into one. And that's as far as I'm going because I need to go brush my brain.<br /><br />This being said, I think I would have adored this book at 14. And I know a lot of my kids will have loved it, so I'm glad I read it, if only so my making fun of it is accurate.<br /><br />Monstrumologist, here I come.<br /><br />(*)>
B0089PWU2E|5.0|Saw Buddy Holly in Madison WI in 1957.  He was and still is magic energy.  This collection shares the same energy

B007HACDLK|4.0|I really enjoyed the book. It caught me right way and intrigued me to the end. Surprises throughout which made it hard to put down.
B004S5FWEC|5.0|I think this is the first of the King & Maxwell series.  I have just finished reading all of them again.  Have now started on the Camel Club series  I am enjoying reading them all again.

B008FRFN7A|5.0|Great app works wonderful with our hp 8600. Can print from any where and go home to find it waiting on me.
B0036FYO12|5.0|They don't make 'em like this any more, at least not very often. A credible plot, intelligent dialogue, luminous stars (Redford and Dunaway), clear, no-nonsense direction (by Sydney Pollack).  The Hitchcock influence is clear - an ordinary man, caught up in a horrific situation that he doesn't understand and isn't prepared for, but somehow manages to make his way through it - but Pollack delivers it in a straightforward way, without any look-at-me tricks.<br /><br />The hi-def transfer is gorgeous, you would think the movie had been made last year.  And I was happily surprised with the Amazon Prime streaming, which went from beginning to end with no buffering interruptions.  Highly recommended.
B001BJARYI|2.0|I was disappointed when I found out it would not work in our DVD player.  We could only watch it on our Computer and although the conversations were English they ofter did not match up well to the action on screen.  That said we will probably quit buying DVDs online and just order Netflix within a few months so that we can finish out our LOST obsession.
B004XZR63M|5.0|Great book overall. Provides alot of insight. It is not a get rich quick book, instead it teaches you fundamentals.<br />If your looking for business ideas from it look elsewhere.<br />Very informative.
B000FC1C32|5.0|I usually like books that are happy,not tragic.This book really gives you an idea of what a ferocious treasure hunt among pirates and commoners was like . I enjoyed the adventure but not the deaths. I am 9 and I had a hard time understanding the old-fashioned English . I recommend this book to middle schoolers. It was very enjoyable to read.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|This is one of if not the best book series I have ever read. Never ending plot twists. Anyone looking for an amazing read check this out.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I was new to the tv show this year and spent several weekends catching up after I beame totally addicted.  I was so bummed when the current season ended.  The show follows the books pretty closely so It gives me the opportunity to continue to immerse myself in the story.  It also clarifys some of the things that I may have missed.  This story is epic!
B004FRX0MY|1.0|It won't down load for nothing on the phone. It's a big disappointment ad it works when it wants to on other products we have.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I liked the imagery of the quick-paced flashbacks of the orphanage but the present time line was a bit taxing on my eagerness to make it a non-stop page turner. The conclusion of the book left me satisfied as the momentum of the book started to let the story fly off the page'. I love the Irish humor found in the book.
B000002A3T|5.0|I still have the empty case, but my CD had vanished. This is one that MUST be replaced, as any lost Pink Floyd must!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Graphics are nice, and the game seems to be easy to learn.  Probably the closest to a real horse that I will ever get.  I love the game...:)  The only negative is that there are frequent pop up ads for other games, annoying but not enough to make me stop playing the game.
B0083GQKQG|5.0|Of course the book was better than the film, but the acting was sensational. I wish the final product had been longer. They left out a lot I would have liked to have seen explored with the actors.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Very fun but hard to make progress quickly.  Game times out and requires purchase to continue.  Fun though.  I still like it.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I couldn't put the book down.  I can't wait to read another. I love Nicholas sparks, captivates my every emotion!
0061120073|4.0|Why did I read this?<br />This is known as a great American classic which means that I should have read it at some point along the way. People were always so surprised that I could have a degree in English and no knowledge of this book. Meaning, I knew it existed but other than that I went into this knowing barely anything about the story besides the fact that \\"it's just one of the greatest books.\\" Why would I want to miss out on one of the greatest books? It's been on my TBR for quite awhile and there is no time like the present, right?<br /><br />What is this book really about?<br />This book is about a family in Williamsburg, Brooklyn in the early 1900s. They have very little to their name and have to work hard just to get enough food in their bellies. At the very core, it's basically the quintessential American Dream tale.<br /><br />It's also a coming-of-age tale as the reader grows up with the family, mainly Francie. Her lack of wealth and status isn't what makes her who she is. As the narration mentions:<br /><br />\\"She was made up of more, too. She was the books she read in the library. She was the flower in the brown bowl. Part of her life was made from the tree growing rankly in the yard. She was the bitter quarrels she had with her brother whom she loved dearly. She was Katie's secret, despairing weeping. She was the shame of her father stumbling home drunk. She was all of these things and of something more...It was what God or whatever is His equivalent puts into each soul that is given life - the one different thing such as that which makes no two fingerprints on the face of the earth alike.\\"<br /><br />The reader has the privilege to learn about all these different aspects of this one person and by the end you may find that you will remember Francie for a long time to come. If you are a big reader then I think it's safe to say that you will find  a portion of yourself in Francie and may even add her to your list of fictional friends.<br /><br />What most resonated with me?<br />I'm about to become a parent for the very first time so I found a conversation Katie (Francie's mother) has with her own mother, after the birth of her first child, to be particularly insightful. During this conversation Katie expresses her worry that she won't be able to raise this child as she knows so little and has so little. Her mother talks about how in this country there is hope and possibility. She encourages Katie to do what she can to educate the child and help to foster her imagination. She also encourages Katie to save money and buy herself a piece of land. I found this conversation to be moving. All you want as a parent is for your children to succeed in whatever they choose and to be happy and you can contribute to that even if you don't have much or know much.<br /><br />What annoyed me most?<br />There was one area where I found that I just could not relate to Francie, her soldier Lee and her sudden devotion and love for him. I have very little patience for silly girls and boys who decide after a minute of knowing someone that they are destined to be with this person and then proceed to pledge their undying love. It's absurd and that entire section made me cringe. I understand that Francie is fairly naive but come on!<br /><br />What did I learn?<br />I learned, from Francie, perseverance. Despite all of the obstacles that stand in her way she finds a way to make her dreams come true by obtaining an education. Even though she is knocked down time and time again and consistently told no, she finds a way to work around that and to keep moving towards her dream. This is something that I need to work harder to do.<br /><br />Should this be labeled an American classic?<br />Most definitely! As mentioned earlier this is the quintessential tale of the American Dream! This story and stories like this capture the hopes my own ancestors had when they arrived in the United States. I'm surprised this wasn't ever required reading for meat any point throughout my education because it is a book that captures this time is America so well.<br /><br />Quote I Love:<br /> \\"From that time on, the world was hers for the reading. She would never be lonely again, never miss the lack of intimate friends. Books became her friends and there was one for every mood.\\"at any point throughout my education because it is a book that captures this time is America so well.<br /><br />Quote I Love:<br /> \\"From that time on, the world was hers for the reading.

B000FBJAEG|4.0|I have never read anything by this author until now with the new television series of King and Maxwell on TNT.  I love books that dwell behind the scenes of the political arena.
B00B1LN8WY|5.0|If you loved it when it was on TV then be prepared to love it on DVD.  Now you don't have to wait each week for a new episode.  But this box set is also super easy storage.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Loaded this on my Kindle. I've tried to play the game three times. So far it freezes each time I try to use it.
B008D30K7E|3.0|I enjoyed the start of the book, i liked the humour in it but after a couple of chapters it was more<br />like a history lesson,
B007LE2VDM|4.0|One of my new favorites. When I'm looking for something on the quieter side, this is my new go to. The song lyrics are great.
B001SGEUNI|5.0|I give 5 stars because album met my expectation. Something new in combination of rock nad metal, nice vocals, if you like something non commercial this is right thing.
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|Prose not as lyrical as 'The Kite Runner' but an important story. It is painfully vivid as it describes wife abuse, war and poverty relieved by the beautiful fierceness of a mother's love and the faithful friendships of women
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|I give 5 stars because album met my expectation. Something new in rock and suprisingly not bad. Phoenix is great.

B008602KQI|4.0|A glimpse into the future perhaps ?????  Some the Cookie, others the crumbs. Ignorance and want..a deadly combination. Freedom erodes into deception. But the deceived in this movie is obvious. Ever learning yet never able to come to the Truth.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini is a talented writer who describes a scene so well that I can picture myself there.  The story is so captivating that it was hard to stop reading it.
B00C5W3SBE|3.0|This movie got a lot of hype, and the special effects werre awesome, but the story did not really keep me entertained through the entire movie.  I was a little disappointed with the hype this movie got relative to how I felt about it when I finished watching it.<br /><br />I love sci fi movies, and action movies, but this one just did not strike a good note with me.

B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Very exciting movie!  I would watch it over and over and over and over and over and over again!  Thanks for the movie
B00992CF6W|5.0|I know that a lot of people have been hating on Mojang for not rolling the update out soon enough but hey, 0.7.3 is here! And it came out just a few days after it actually came out. So that's good. But the thing is is that if you're playing on a local server with someone who's on iOS or Android then you may run into some problems. And people 0.8.0 Isn't even close to releasing yet. So stop crying about it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun background change is awesome they are doing great hope they keep it up<br />Also hope other people enjoy it as muck as me
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is so simple that it's awesome. The next update should have a muscle car or something that goes really fast. Great game.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|Excellent addition to any Blu Ray collection. I'm not going to touch on the story here (which I really recommend you watch and enjoy) but instead touch on the Blu Ray features. The sound is amazing, the picture is amazing, and it really does make a difference when you experience Season 1 in this format. It was exciting when aired on Showtime, but the picture and sound quality of the Blu Ray just simply cannot be beat. Even if you've seen this Season, an excellent grab to refresh your memory or start anew just prior to the airing of Season 3.
B000E1MXSW|4.0|As ever, Audrey Hepburn delivered a stellar performance in portraying the character deserving the Best Actress Oscar.<br /><br />The story line though, to no fault of Ms. Hepburn, is wanting in some aspects.  I can't go into detail for I am not adept with the technical terminologies.  The story left me searching to find out who the nun is - on whom the story is based on, and more. The nun's name was not Gabrielle van der Maal, or is it?
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I bought this because I was planning to go to a concert (Red tour), and wanted to be familiar with the material.  This thing has grown on me over the last week or two, and I've now decided I love most of the CD.  The concert was pretty good, as it turned out.

B0013N7AD8|5.0|Excellent set of the first four Batman movies (Batman, Batman Returns, Batman Forever and Batman & Robin) on 5 discs. The box boasts of 18 hours of special features included with 9 music videos. Each film gets deluxe treatment. They don't skip over weak sequels like Batman & Robin as many other film collections do. Overall, the audio quality is great and the picture quality is superb. A digital copy of the original Batman is provided on the fifth disc which is compatible with PCs, PSP and iTunes.

It's almost as valuable as some Star Wars boxsets and much better than the Dark Knight trilogy boxset which offers 25% of the bonus material that this collection offers (though I admit the Dark Knight films are terrific and more accessible for some fans). My only complaints are that there is nothing new for the Blu-Ray release for fans who already own the DVD box set (aside from one digital copy). This is also one of the priciest sets for 4 films I have reviewed (but easily worth the money). Admittedly, it is loaded with bonus supplements and has held its value. It is rumored that the Batman directors are working on additional commentaries, restoring deleted scenes and releasing director's cuts in future releases.

B000I8G5GW|5.0|Stout fellow, Alec Guinness.  His portrayal of Colonel Nicholson is unforgettable.  Leading British soldiers into a Japanese prison camp in the middle of a jungle where escape seems utterly impossible, he sets out to do something incomprehensible, i.e. turn their defeat into victory.  This he succeeds in doing, but at a terrible cost. After winning a life-and-death battle of wills with the Japanese commander, Colonel Saito (masterfully played by Sessue Hayakawa), Nicholson and his engineers create their crowning achievement: a bridge over the River Kwai.  However, when the bridge is threatened by British commandoes, Colonel Nicholson is faced with a tragic dilemma.  King and country momentarily forgotten, his first loyalty becomes to the bridge itself, sinking his own mind into madness, a dreadful tragedy of betrayal, and ultimate redemption.  This is quite simply one of the finest films ever made, highly recommended to all viewing audiences.
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|Raiders of the Lost Ark and its 3 sequels are here with over 7 hours of special features on 5 Discs. The Indiana Jones series makes its HD debut with excellent video and audio quality. It suffers from average packaging and not all the extras from Crystal Skull are here in HD. Fortunately, the 3-hour bonus disc from the DVD set has been retained (except the storyboard galleries). There is one new extra \\"On set with ROTLA\\".<br /><br />Special Features:<br />- On set with Raiders of the Lost Ark: Witness the making of Raiders as it happened with newly revealed footage that puts you on the set during production, alongside filmmakers, cast and crew.<br />- Film Foursome: The \\"Making of\\" all 4 Indiana Jones Adventures: Join filmmakers Steven Spielberg and George Lucas for an up-close look at each production, and the evolution of the original action hero, Indiana Jones.<br />- Cast and Creator Interviews<br />- Behind-the-Scenes Peeks: Stunts, Sounds, Special Effects and more!<br /><br />Buy this BR collection. This is a must-have for fans of the franchise because it is a definite upgrade over the DVD releases in almost every way. My only complaint is that there are no deleted scenes. The 2-season, 28 episode television series The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones isn't included either.
B00486070K|3.0|These Apple adapters have been around forever - in one version or another, although they all look the same - and there are now many adapters that do similar things for less money. That said, these truly do \\"just work\\" with Macs, and they provide a quick and easy way to add extra Ethernet ports to any Mac with a spare USB port.<br /><br />You can attach as many of these as you have free USB ports, and you'll gain that many Ethernet ports, although speed is going to go from marginal (10/100) to worse (10/100 spread over numerous ports) once the USB controller gets saturated.<br /><br />If you have a computer which isn't a Mac, buy a different adapter - it'll be cheaper. If you have a newer Mac and don't need more than one additional Ethernet port, get the Thunderbolt version since it's much faster. Otherwise, or if you want to add even more ports, get this. It's reasonably small, not unattractive, and fully functional without issue.
B002M9WW30|2.0|Rocky is about an average guy with a big dream. He has to out-box Apollo Creed for the heavyweight championship. The chemistry and performances in this franchise are excellent. Rocky fans will be happy to find all 6 Rocky movies from the original to Rocky Balboa are included here in this 7-disc Blu-ray collection (2009). The series never got much love in the way of extras (many previous DVD sets had no extras). This set includes a 7th Bonus Disc (Rocky Anthology) with recycled extras from the Rocky 2-Disc Collector's Edition DVD, Rocky Balboa BD and one new HD game (Feeling Strong Now!) which is fun for a time. Overall the product isn't as comprehensive as fans would prefer. It seems somewhat slapdash as if Rocky I-V barely exist (the sequels are mostly ignored). Only Rocky Balboa gets special treatment with extras on its disc, the only audio commentary and deleted scenes. Forget about the frequently mentioned Rocky IV and V trimmed scenes and director's cut of Rocky V. We are missing a truly comprehensive documentary on the franchise (76 minutes describing 6 films doesn't cut it anymore when Blade Runner got a 3-hour deluxe documentary for a single film). There is a total of roughly 4.5 hours of total bonus supplements (3.5 hours from Rocky 2-disc DVD & 1 hour from Rocky Balboa BD) which is good but not great. 6 films deserve at least 6 hours in extras, new documentaries and/or a remastering for such a great franchise. So this collection is the light version of the box set and certainly not deluxe. This set delivers mostly \\"single film treatment\\" which is so common to box sets. The first five films in The Planet of the Apes franchise got better treatment.<br /><br />Disc 7: Rocky Anthology Bonus Disc: Feeling Strong Now!

Consider purchasing this collection as the value pack ($6/film) if you don't own them all. Rocky II-V don't have many extras in their stand-alone releases and nothing much is added here. If you enjoy two or more of the films it is worth it. I would rate the films 5 stars and this collection 2 stars because it could have been so much better and isn't a major upgrade from the DVD collection. Many franchises get poor treatment but prior Rocky releases felt like the movie was slapped onto disc and shipped out. Rocky was loved by millions, inspired thousands and deserves heartfelt remastering. IGN ranked this release at #18 in Top 25 Worst Blu-Ray releases (notably Robocop Trilogy, The Terminator and Predator: Ultimate Hunter Edition also make the list). The video and audio quality aren't up to snuff. If you already own the Rocky film collection then this doesn't add much. Although you do get a few extras on Disc 7 it seems cynical to include so little bonus content (not all of the DVD extras were ported over either). The problem is that not all of the films seem to be in true HD (the transfers are the best Rocky has looked but still don't look great when compared to other Blu-Rays). Rocky fans deserve better treatment.Make Up!

B00AZ7V0W0|3.0|This Blu-Ray collection includes the first 7 films of the Nightmare on Elm Street film franchise on only 5 discs (Chucky got 6 discs for 6 films!). 4 discs are Blu-ray while the fifth disc is a DVD. A commemorative booklet is included. There are 3 hours of special features on Disc 5 (Fear Himself, 2 episodes of Freddy's Nightmares, Conclusions, Welcome to Prime Time). Most of the features from the previous DVD box set release are included. Those supplements are good but brief. 13 deleted scenes are included in Welcome to Prime Time. The downside is that there is less than an hour of new material (close to 3 hours if you count the remastered Freddy's Nightmares episodes). Fortunately, the Dokken music video is here (but only in SD). There is roughly 4.5 hours of total bonus content in this collection.<br /><br />Video Resolution/Codec: 1080p/AVC MPEG-4   Aspect Ratio: 1.85:1<br />Audio Formats: English DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 (First Disc Only), English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, English Dolby Digital 2.0, French Dolby Digital 1.0<br />Subtitles/Captions: English SDH, French, Spanish<br />Special Features: Audio Commentaries, Featurettes, Documentary, Music Videos, Alternate Endings, Deleted Scenes, Interactive Trivia Track, Trailers, Bonus TV Episodes<br /><br />Limitations: 2 films are missing (Freddy vs. Jason; Nightmare on Elm Street reboot) which are sold separately. Overall, the picture quality is average but the audio quality is a little better. The 1999 Nightmare Encyclopedia is missing and the original film gets the lion's share of extras. Previous making of documentaries (e.g. The Making of Freddy's Dead) aren't included. The full 240-minute documentary Never Sleep Again is cut down to 50 minutes. The only commentaries included are 2 for the original and a commentary for New Nightmare (they seem to be old laserdisc versions). Discs 2, 3, and 4 in this 5-disc set have 2 films on them so the series doesn't get a disc per film like it should. The original Nightmare is not the 2010 Infinifilm version. Nightmare 5 is the R-rated version that doesn't include the extended scenes on VHS. Nightmare 6 does not include the 3D scene as it was intended. No sign of the \\"I Am Nancy\\" (2011) 71-minute documentary. The excellent Tobe Hooper pilot for Freddy's Nightmares is not included.

B00DRPVE3M|3.0|Very fun and just like the classic. My only complaint is very slow to build up coins to be able to play games.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|Can't really beat this for a free app. It's fun to play and the little puddin monsters say cute little giberish, makes me crack up. The music isn't annoying either. I enjoy playing it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It installed in seconds, which it was Ipad ready but I can wait.  Watched HBOgo on my big screen for the first time as well as very easy browsing.  It also stayed on HBO as I was surfing.  Just waiting to buy another for my bedroom tv. j

B008Y5UADK|3.0|A little interesting but felt like a waste of time when it ended.  It was a little too much art and not enough story
0062073486|4.0|Almost universally admired, Agatha Christie's story of ten people lured to Soldier's Island on various grounds, only to find that one-by-one, they are murdered, is a seminal work of the genre. Each person has, in some way, been directly or indirectly, responsible for the death of another somewhere in their past, but each was beyond the reach of the law. At first, the supposed owner of the Island is an obvious suspect, but a search of the grounds reveals that no one else inhabits the place. The murderer has to be one of the ten. The plot builds slowly, as each surviving individual might well be singled out as the deviant until he or she is found to have taken a final breath. And each of them dies, in line with the nursery rhyme that permeates the book, Ten Little Indians.<br /><br /> As always Christie's writing is somewhat ponderous, and there are a few dead spots along the way, but the scheme she devises wins out over any defects in her prose.

B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It's a fun game but instead of giving it 5 stars I gave it 4 because after defeating the 3 villains there's not much else to do except complete the challenges and compete with friends for the highest score.
1416972242|4.0|I'll be honest, there is a lot going on in this sequel.  I really don't know how to summarize this plot, because, like with most middle books, there is just too much happening.  The most basic thing I can say is that they are still battling Valentine and things get really complicated, really fast.<br /><br />I had a hard time getting myself to both start this and continue reading it.  Not, mind you, because of any problem with writing or character development, or any of the normal nonsense that gets in my way, but because I knew that still particular installment wasn't going to end with Jace and Clary happily together.  Reading my little sisters review told me quite clearly that, regardless of how well written and entertaining this book is, I just wasn't going to love it.  The love triangle aspect is played up even more in this one, where Clary obviously believes Jace is her brother and starts dating Simon.  Can I just say that sibling thing is BS?  I know it seems like they are and all the evidence points to that end, but just no.  I can feel it in my bones that it's just not true and deep down, I think Clary and Jace know it too.  But that doesn't stop Clary from being horrified by the feelings she has for her \\"brother\\" and the whole dating Simon thing that just irritated the heck out of me.  I'm sorry, I love Simon, but we all know he is going to end up with Maia.  That much is completely obvious after one freaking meeting between the two.  Besides I want Simon to be happy and having Clary settle for him will never make him happy.<br /><br />I really hate reviewing middle books, it's so freaking difficult to put how I feel for them into words.  This one manages to more or less escape that middle book syndrome, being entirely entertaining and action packed in its own right, but I just hate being dead center in the middle of the story, you know?  Or better yet, still just at the being since now this tale is a now a six book series instead of the originally planned trilogy.  There is so much that's happened that I don't approve of &lt;spoiler>like Simon becoming a vampire&lt;/spoiler>, but there is still so much to come that I don't exactly know how I feel.  It's hard to rate middle books properly because how I will feel about the series overall is entirely dependent upon how it ends.  I can't love it if Clary and Jace don't end up together.  Speaking of endings, I can just say that the ending of this one freaking sucked?  The whole Jace/Clary/Simon triangle and the ending conversation in the epilogue between Clary and Jace and just....grh!<br /><br />So, I'll just say this, it was an enjoyable ride and I can't wait to start the next one...in fact that what I'll be doing this afternoon, before reporting to college for my first day of fall semester.trilogy.

1452126577|5.0|I bought this book for my Girlfriend who loves all things grumpy cat<br />she had to take it up to bed to look at and was laughing and loving it and decided to take it to work the next day.<br />All in all it was a good purchase.<br /><br />Or as grumpy cat would say;<br />&#34;It was a waste of time and money and I hated every drop of ink on every page, almost as much as I hate you.&#34;

B00DP3IESY|3.0|This movie went on and on and on...after the 3rd (what I thought was the end)...I think I gave up...this movie went on and on and not to mention the endless circles of stories...as far as action goes I gave it a struggling 3 stars.
B00332CWLW|3.0|I enjoyed the book but found that there were so many different characters and stories that I could sometimes get confused.  He brings it together well at the end.
B00BI745AA|5.0|As good a screen adaptation of a stage production as I've seen, and I loved the stage play so much I saw it 5 times.  I've already watched the film twice, and no doubt shall view it again.  A marvelous story!

B001FB4W0M|5.0|Most tv shows struggle to maintain the quality as they age. Supernatural just keeps getting better. The story lines are just amazing and the whole show just continues to shock and awe. Now entering it's ninth season it's still awesome. Well worth your time and hard earned money
0312427573|3.0|Just not a favorite book, must be a &#34;guy&#34; thing as it was so highly recommended by two favorite media hosts. I am not even finishing it, which is a rarity.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A REAL PAGE TURNER. I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN! Will defiantly recommend to friends to read this book! Nail biter!
140006922X|5.0|I consider myself to be an educated lay person on the subject of Early Christianity (I don't have the academic credentials, but have read much of the scholarly literature as well as books by scholars geared toward a lay audience).  Having said that, I agree with the author's main thesis and conclusions, but have one gnawing gripe with his statement toward the end of the book that the Council of Nicaea was made up entirely of Roman (Western) bishops.    In actuality, almost all the bishops in attendance were from the Eastern part of the Empire, with maybe at most five who were from the West.  Another minor point is that, as the author indicates, perhaps close to 2,000 attended the Council, but this figure includes all of the assistants, presbyters, and deacons traveling with the probably less than 300 bishops who actually attended.    It's difficult to be an expert on the entire gamut of early Christian history, and this is why most scholars focus on one aspect or time period to study.  That said, this is a book that should be on the must-read list of everyone who identifies him or herself as a Christian.  In this age of easy access to well-written and accessible scholarly information, there is no excuse for people not to educate themselves about their espoused faith, and in these troubled times, the need for this education has never been greater.

B000WEMH3C|1.0|Pros:<br />Your grill is covered, at least until there is a wind.<br />Great if you are looking to keep dust off your grill in the garage.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Your grill is not covered at the first sign of wind.<br />It is light and easily rips.
B00DFRVAC2|5.0|Not much to say but when listening to it I can feel the fun I had when I was watching the movie. Makes me want to go out and watch it a third time.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I really loved this book. What touched me about it was the simplicity underneath it all. I love that Gaiman leaves mystery in his books. He doesn't answer all the questions and that is part of this books charm. It's not about the end and the why....it's about the journey.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|great movie learn how it all began  from the being where  friendships starts and everyone crew member stick together and bond
B001AQT0RC|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  It looks good but not great on Blu-Ray.  Some of the special effects scenes are a little fuzzy, but overall its still good.  I love the story and the characters.  I love the actor that plays her father.  Basically it is great and everyone should see this movie!
B009JBZH54|5.0|Great packaging, I just wish I had not forgotten that I needed the region-free version of this. Hopefully, my laptop will be able to play the Blu-Rays once I get the required hardware. Still, even if they don't work, I'm glad I bought this for the packaging and the other small goodies alone :)
B0061US58C|5.0|lots of action. best for age 8 and up.  younger children would not follow the fast paced plot.  my 14 and 16 year old liked it because they are racing fans and noticed race car drivers like Jeff Gordon and Daryl Waltrip  that were portrayed in the movie.  Enjoyable for adults who like clean wholesome suspense.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I liked this book at least as good as his other two. I feel like I'm in the story--living it as I read it
B0096A9QXC|5.0|really fun game! I liked it because there's not just one objective, you have to do lots of different things. but I wish you could collect coins like in tap the frog Doodle to buy your frog clothes
B007IXWL2C|4.0|After reading all 3 books,I have to say I did enjoy this series a lot & I am a little sad it's over.I did feel that the ending was a bit rushed with skipping so much time & then showing bits & pieces of their son.The ending just felt like I was left hanging & I was missing so much.Christian also always seems like he is some big rich millionaire,but he is never at work at all.Just always on the phone & one or 2 meetings which isn't realistic for the job that he has.Also sometimes he is a stalking maniac that reacts & throws tantrums at the littlest stupid things that Anastasia just tolerates all the time which is annoying,along with repeating how hot Christian is on every page & the repetitive actions like rolling her eyes,or biting her lip,or the twitchy palm thing.Other than those cons I stated,the books were a good read & I was hooked.Overall for the whole series I would give it a 4.5.
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|first, there is a crazy amount of ads; a video between every Match, which gets irritating really fast, and another pop up at the main menu.<br /><br />second, the tokens needed for each game is complete bull. You don't get any for completing games either, only from the scracth game you could play. which you can only play every 40 minutes. and even then, you can on get enough tokens for one other game (2 if you are lucky). so really, unless you are willing to shell out some money, you are only able to play one short game an hour.<br /><br />third, and this could be just me, but the ads have gotten so bad that I'm cannot play any longer. every time I start up the game a pop up ad takes up the entire screen. and the only two options are to download the game it is advertising, or to click the close button. thing is, every time you attempt to close it, it automatically redirects you to another empty page that only says, &quot;you do not have permission to go to on this page: exit&quot;. Then when you go back to try to play, again, a different ad shows up, but it has the same problem. you cant just escape it, it just keeps redirecting you to that same blank page.<br /><br />this game really wants your money.

B0027P2ZWC|5.0|Incredible.  Just incredible.  I fell in love with Lea Solonga after watching this.  I feel like this is someone I should have known before - afterall, she's pretty famous in certain circles.  But her singing here was beyond words.  But everyone did so well, and when the whole company joined in chorus, it was just amazing. Turn it up and start singing along.  You won't be able to get this out of your head.  And the story - the Victor Hugo story is one of the best ever written - and teaches us the difference between true faith and staunch legalism.
B0018QOIXU|3.0|Adele is not as mature as she is on 21. The some songs are loud and not pleasant. Very screechy.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|It's an entertaining story, movie, good acting, and good plot.  I went in expecting a Tom Cruise s*** show, and came out pleasantly surprised at how good it was.  I'm still shocked.  Definitely made my Saturday night.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|Very interesting way to tell the story of how WWII affected a group of people on Guernsey in England. Not your usual war novel.
B003NRYMZQ|3.0|I would have given it 1-2 stars but embarrassingly, I'm a sucker for the current day sci-fi.  There are just so few shows even close to replacing X-files/alien investigation type plots that I would not want to turn anyone away that's looking for this type of show.  Surprisingly, it has more plot than say Primeval (currently showing 2013).  It is just that some of the lines in this show are hilariously tacky, that unless you a die-hard for this kind of alien thing, you'll probably settle for some other kind of sci-fi.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved the structure of the novel. Every other chapter was written from thge past and every other was written in the present. Shocking surprises await.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|It was fun at the beginning......but you need to purchase stars/tokens to continue.  I don't like to purchase game tokens....so now, I can not advance to next level.
B000053VAZ|5.0|I love this movie.  It came much quicker than I was told, so that was nice.  I have watched it several times with my nieces and nephews and they all loved it too.  Good family movie.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I enjoy playing the game and visit daily but I don't like dino world...the only way you can get fun buildings is if you have tons of acorns to spend. And I'm not about to spend real money just to get acorns..that's ridiculous! I will just stick to playing with the ice world.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|How can you go wrong with so many talented actors, but in this case the scenery is the scene stealer. I only rented it, but I think I'll buy it and watch it again and again. This movie has something for everyone - young love, old love, drama, humor. I love it!
B003MTGW80|5.0|I would concur almost completely with Santa Fe Listener's review of this box, but I see no reason to withhold the fifth star.  Sometimes time, place, person, and sound engineers coincide in a kind of magical alignment (like Klemperer, Legge, the Philharmonia, and the Kingsway Hall, c.1957-59), and that seems to me to have happened with Guilini, the LAPO, and the DGG engineers c.1980.  One can see it as a bit old-fashioned, but as with Bohm and Klemperer, Guilini knows how to maintain rhythmic grip and build a climax, so that the listener is carried along on his (Guilini's) conception of the music as it develops.  You can check the timings later and say,\\"By gosh, that was slower than Kleiber, or Szell, or whoever,\\" but in the experience itself it provides you with all you need to know (i. e. hear).  I think the Brahms First here is as good as it gets, and the sound is spectacular.  The Second is just about as good.  The highest praise I can give to the Beethoven Third and Sixth is to say that Guilini's accounts are in the Bohm class -- which is to take nothing away from Kleiber, Klemperer, Jochum et. al.  And, again like SFL, I have an especially warm spot for this Schumann -- I very much like Szell's and Kubelik's accounts, but this version solves two problems -- first the recording and Guilini allow us to hear the sound not merely as thick but as rich and textured, and I especially appreciate that in the third and fourth movements.  The third has a kind of formal dance-like character to it, without ever becoming quite a dance, and the fourth has some of the feel of a funeral march, but without the relentlessness.  They are odd, original, and interesting movements.  The other problem that Guilini's account of this Schumann symphony solves is the problem of climax, especially in the first movement.  So much of the writing for the brass sounds like it belongs in a climax, and some conductors underplay some of it to \\"build\\" to a climax.  Guilini plays it straight and full out, and it's exciting (and beautifully recorded), and yet he still convinces you that there's one climax when it comes at the movement's end.  Sheer conductorial magic, there.  I still have to listen to the French disc, but I don't expect to be disappointed.  Twenty years earlier, Guilini gave us a Mozart \\"Figaro\\" and a \\"Don Giovanni\\" that are still as good as any.  These LAPO recordings mark his next great period as a conductor.ull out, and it's exciting (and beautifully recorded), and yet he still convinces you that there's one climax when it comes at the movement's end.

B00BGIBVP8|1.0|I wished I had read some reviews instead of just watching the trailer before watching this movie. It looked funny, but the yelling with the F bombs really got old. I made it through about 1 & 1/2 hours then just fast forwarded to the end. I just didn't care about the characters. So unrealistic. Who talks like that? If it were actually funny it would have been ok to be so unrealistic. And WAY TOO LONG! Not my kind of humor.
140006922X|4.0|This book is great at providing all the known info on the life of Jesus, the man.  Unfortunately, there is just so little documentation of his adult life.
B000A7DVRC|1.0|The only purpose of the movie appears to have been to have actors utter way too mach profanity.  Waste of money and time!
B00DBSZEH2|5.0|This was a great movie! I do believe that when the next movie come out, I would consider going to the movies to watch it. Great Movie!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I love historic fiction and this one I simply can't put it down. Don't know how Ken Follett can have several stories, several main caracteres and we still don't get lost. I'm easy to please, so I just love it...
B00DGN51O8|5.0|I like this movie. I am sure there will be a second movie coming out soon that continues the story.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|This is a serious Sci-Fi movie that just blows the senses away.<br /><br />The whole movie has amazing scenery and you can tell the director was very devoted to this movie. You might not like Tom Cruise personally, but you have to admit that he is an amazing actor. I personally felt like I was their with him and the movie just sucks you in.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the movie and hope you do to.
B000FA5STS|4.0|Very good read. Kept me turning pages not wanting it to end. Buy it and enjoy a real page turner.
B009B1UZ7C|5.0|The fact that Jake Bugg is as young as he is and talented as he is should really impress anyone that listens.  While other musicians his age (oh let's just name one 1D) are out making crap he is a real throw back to great original music.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Slow and nothing good to say about this app unless you're a fan of ads and really slow response times.
B00908DDZM|4.0|Macklemore has such a great quality to his voice.  While the hits are probably the best of the album for commerical purposes, the other songs tell the history and introduce you nicely to the artist.
B006S053K8|5.0|This film brought a smile to my face, and thanks to the brilliant performances and chemistry between the two leads of Kristen Stewart and Jesse Eisenberg, and the highly talented supporting cast, it proved to be sheer entertainment.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|Emeli Sande has an amazing clear voice and is a great song writer.  The highlights for me were Where I Sleep, My Kind of Love and River.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|As always what is happening and why in a David Baldacci book.  I have never read a book he wrote that I have not liked.
B003EY7IUY|5.0|I have read all the other books in the set and this is another great read by Sophie Kinsella great author.
B004TI5N38|4.0|The big Why? is always there in the background.  It gave me a different view of the army life.  But it is a work of fiction and I took it that way.
B0054SMIH6|3.0|Enjoyed it.  This movie is a good &#34;let's eat a pizza on the couch tonight and watch a movie&#34; kind of show.  It's a little predictable but still a good story.  What a cast!
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|Candy crash or candy crush, neither one worked. Again it was a waste of time and space. I did not want it, I was just looking at the details and next thing you know it is installed on my Kindle!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|We are very addicted to this program and love having it on DVD.  Even my husband is into it.<br />Can't wait for the next season.
B005ZUR724|5.0|Saw a lot of mixed reviews when I was looking at the game. Some people said it was great but others complained about the network problems. Decided to get it was pleasantly surprised that I did not encounter any problems. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes mmorpg's.
B00E0S52K6|5.0|A must have if you're a Buddy Guy fan!  Buddy once again proves why he's still putting out music after all these years
B009NG1Q96|4.0|I enjoyed this book a lot, I ate it up. Maxon gets on my nerves and so does America at times but at the same time, it keeps my attention. I'm on the edge of my seat waiting for book 3!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The Game have varied ways of solving the puzzle. Some floors have multiple rooms which is quite fun. Looking forward to additional rooms.
B005LAIHSQ|3.0|The Snow White character was totally mis cast. She looks like a depressed heroin addict / vampire, not a Snow White purity.
B00DHNBPA6|5.0|Scary and thrilling. Definitely deserves a five star rating if you love being scared, if you like supernatural. Totally Evil.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|It is excellent in 2D! But 3D is like a different movie. Wow! The color and computer generated effects are the best!
B004LWZW88|5.0|This was a great little film. Very funny. Enjoyable to kids, but also entertaining for adults. Great use of fairy tale characters and very funny back story for Puss.
1595141979|5.0|love this book and the entire series it so hard to put down it definitly is one of the best in the series
B00993FEUK|5.0|Not the greatest movie in the world, but it made me laugh. Very enjoyable eccentric people and a pretty good story. This film, however, should not be marketed as being for kids. It is too intense and well above their heads intellectually. I would recommend teen plus.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I was instantly hooked to reading the book as soon as I picked it up.  Within two days I had finished the first book and within the first week was done with the sequel as well.  I think what makes Ender's Game such a fantastic book to read is the brilliance and resourcefulness of the protagonist.  Orson Scott Card does an excellent job of displaying how Ender IS the &#34;last salvation&#34; of humanity without making it obvious.  The action in the book is well-described and easy to comprehend.  Overall a must-read book in my opinion.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This book was very good. The language was so well thought out. It makes you really think what secrets will do to you and your life and how something as tiny as an atom can change it forever.

B00BHHIWQO|3.0|i do play once in a while the problem is you have to have wi fi to play with it
B003Y5D776|5.0|I bought this to improve the sound input over the microphone jack on my PowerMac G4. Also for recording with my MacBook Pro. It does the job. GarageBand recognized it and the OS recognized it from the Sound System Preference Panel. No additional software required.

B00ABXA1HI|5.0|I stumbled upon this app by chance and I didn't really believe the product description, but I downloaded it anyway. This app has helped me in many ways, I can lie on my bed and use Microsoft word or browse the pictures and documents on my kindle. I recommend this for people who cannot bother sit in front of the computer for long and its very easy to setup and use.
B000FC12SM|4.0|I'm recently divorced from a hard marriage. My x is the only one that I knew from dating ../ married to. So I read this book to help me understand men and to make sure that I do not compare the guy I am dating now to a not so good guy that I was married to. This book has helped me understand men in general a lot better then what I was use to before.
B008JFUO36|3.0|I thought it was an okay movie. dont really get into these kinds of movies. however it was really cool & even cute at some parts, & I do like Tom Cruise

B004W1GCNC|5.0|An outstanding series. Great sets, acting, and story. My only complaint is there should be at least 3 more series.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|I have always loved Nathan Fillion and I have the \\"Firefly\\" series, so when I heard that he was in a new series called Castle I had to watch.  I have Seasons 1 - 4 on DVD and am planning to buy season 5.  All the actors are excellent and well casted.  Stana Katic is a perfect fit for Kate Beckett and Castle's love interest, Molly Quinn as the responible daughter, and I also love Susan Sullivan as his mother.  Most of the shows I have seen Susan Sullivan in she played the part of \\"Maggie\\" (i.e. Falcon Crest).  I must say that not since \\"Remmington Steel\\" have I enjoyed a series so much.  Keep up the good work.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this app. Such a great brain teaser! I like to play it at night as a wag of relaxing after a hard day.

B0095P31L6|5.0|A great animation! The animal characters with the exception of Rango himself are perfect. The plot is old hat but the jokes are fun and the action is fast.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|Great album - great album - great album - Mr. Bowie continues to show the world how it is done with style and grace.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Movie was ok, but some of the screenplay got tedious for me. They didn't really pull off the horror of the games.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Lots of witty statements between Harvey and Mike Ross. The two bond in a sort of clashing personality. Enjoyable show overall.
B0070UFMOW|2.0|The E17 is an attractive device and it delivers nice sound. However, the LCD screen went black after using the E17 for just 6 weeks. I use it about 20 hours a week and always turn it off when not in use. The unit still functions as a DAC but now I cannot see what I am doing - I have to blindly press the menu button and the +/- buttons and hope I eventually land on the right thing. Others have stated the issues surrounding Fiio repairs. Not going to send this to China on my $30 and then wait 2+ months for them to send a repaired one.
0143119680|5.0|I am so looking forward to her 3rd Book of this series in English! Never thought one could fall in Love with a Vampire. Quite the Romance!
0062080237|4.0|After blitzing through Neil Gaiman's iconic and wondrous \\"Sandman\\" series, it wasn't long before I began the first few steps of Shadow's great journey across the wide-open roads of America. I'd wanted to read \\"American Gods\\" for years, and after experiencing just how amazing The Sandman was, I was even more thrilled. Gaiman's classic mixture of the modern and the mythological combined with the all-American road trip? What's not to love?<br /><br />Alas, my expectations were too high. Similar to Michael Chabon's \\"The Yiddish Policeman's Union,\\" I loved roughly 90% of \\"Gods\\" but couldn't reconcile the remaining percentage. Like \\"Union,\\" Gaiman's novel is wonderfully imagined, packed full of brilliant ideas and unique approaches. I was totally sucked in by the first page and couldn't get enough, taken with lovely and memorable characters like Czernobog, Mr. Nancy, Mr. Wednesday, and Mad Sweeney. Also, like \\"Union,\\" this book is skillfully composed, the dialogue and prose both crackling with Gaiman's prodigious aptitude with words.<br /><br />I discovered that, just as Gaiman proved with The Sandman, there probably isn't anybody better out there at weaving together the world of the now with ancient tales and legends. The references to various mythologies and religions are deep and subtle, painting Gaiman as more of a reverent scholar than a pop-culture pilferer. He doesn't come right out and identify certain characters as specific gods, requiring the reader to do a little Googling in order to shed some light on his esoteric cast of deities.<br /><br />As much as I enjoyed the majority of my ride with Shadow, it started to fall apart toward the end. For one thing, the final reveal of the mystery behind Shadow's journey feels needlessly complicated and highly improbable. It seemed more to me as though Gaiman had written himself into a corner and frantically knotted stray threads together to make the story work. (I noticed this in \\"Sandman\\" as well, especially in the climactic volume \\"The Kindly Ones\\" - it felt as though even Gaiman himself had few of the answers to his own convoluted plot.) I can commiserate with him on that regard being a writer myself, but the ending just didn't gel for me. In addition, the \\"climax\\" is horribly anti-climactic. There is little Shadow needs to do but arrive onto the scene and open his mouth. Zero tension whatsoever. I thought to myself when I was reading it, \\"Come on, Neil, I know you're better than this.\\"<br /><br />Lastly, the subplot surrounding the years-long disappearance of children in the small town of Lakeside was awfully predictable. Admittedly, I didn't catch on to where they were disappearing (the answer of which was in front of my face the whole time - great job on that, Neil!), but I easily surmised who was behind it. It's an easy trope of murder mysteries: sometimes all you have to do is just have to point at the most unlikely suspect, and you'll probably be right.<br /><br />Such a letdown. Out of all of Gaiman's novels, this was the one that I was looking forward to reading the most. Ah, well. It still stands as a symbol of the man's talents and his love for all things old and mystical. I hear good things about Neverwhere, so maybe that'll be my next stop.ctic volume \\"The Kindly Ones\\" - it felt as though even Gaiman himself had few of the answers to his own convoluted plot.)

They all tell me Amazon isn't responsible for any news releases.  Sounds like to me they made a news release to cover themselves and have no intentions on resolving the order issue. Pure PR Stunt!!!!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book is very well written. The story really takes you in and makes you think about your own life.

0767903862|5.0|I absolutely loved this book by Bill Bryson.  No one writes about destinations like he does.  His descriptions of his impressions and experiences will make you chuckle while familiarizing you with famous landmarks and obscure towns in the leeway. If I hear of anyone at all interested in Australia, or going to Australia, I gift them this book.  But the rest of us love it too, because through Bill's eyes we feel we've been there as well, which is probably the closest most of us will get.  If I ever do go, I'm going to invite him along.
B00B7NPRY8|5.0|I'm admittedly biased, seeing as I am a fan of both fantasy and science fiction, but let me quickly summarize how you should feel about Dune:  Confused.  In a good way.<br /><br />Dune has always been a book that required a surprising amount of attention.  Herbert's attention to detail, the incredibly complex and well-fleshed-out universe includes more story in it than most long-running series. I'd argue that the details and attention paid to those details in Dune might be some of the most fun parts of reading the book, but in truth it all really comes down to one thing: Frank Herbert challenged his audience to not only read his book, but think about it.  He asks questions about determinism, religion, morality, politics, and even gender.  He establishes people instead of characters.  He creates worlds instead of settings.  It is one of the most engaging books I've read, and I have endured a lot of poor science fiction to get here and find this masterpiece.  Read it, enjoy it, and share it with your friends.  I'm nearly positive they'll appreciate it.
B00E7PQVHK|4.0|The battles in this rpg are fun. The strategy needed keeps things interesting. This app works on my Fire HD. Some people complain that it wont play, but the only problem I have run into is that the game can quit out if you decide to flee from a battle.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I've seen almost every version of Jane Eyre including the Hollywood versions.  This adaption is by far the best.  It is better, acted, written and directed than the 2011 version.<br /><br />Jane Eyre is mostly dark tale of a heroine orphaned as a baby.  Her uncle loved her best and his resentful wife could not forgive her and after his untimely death, she made Jane pay for it.  The horrible boarding school Jane was sent to was largely based on elements in the authors life, Bronte was sent to a similar school, in this school she lost her sister who was her best friend.<br /><br />Jane becomes a governess to a child in a estate with more secrets than people.  The dark brooding guardian to the child, Edward Rodchester who seems revived by this homely governess has a few skeletons in his closets that may keep, Jane away from the first person to show her love.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|I appreciate a movie that can be both exciting and not terribly immoral, gory, and sexual. There were some gory themes, but the scenes' portrayal did manage to avoid some of the explicit gore that other movies have. No sex or close to sex scenes, and a backdrop of good morals. Able to watch this with my two teenage boys with them enjoying it and also me not so worried what effect it was having on them. Usually I have to choose between the two.
B008220BP2|4.0|This movie depicts a Zombie named R struggling to figure out life, while occasionally eating the living.  He lives in an airport, one day him and his friend M, go out to catch a meal.  He sees jullie for the first time, though he doesn't know what to do with a girl, he knows he doesn't want to eat her.<br /><br />If you like zombies and happy endings this is the movie for you.<br /><br />I found some of the movie pretty funny.  The brain eatting is a bit sickening.  It would get a higher rating, but it doesn't watch as well a second time. It is one of the few Zombie movies that doesn't give me nightmares.<br /><br />It's not for everyone, it depressed my mommy, my sister said it had too much swearing and my best friend thought it was too cooky for her.
B0047S1KMS|4.0|Loved it. the plot was great the action was realistic and the gore was great. I do not particularly like the characters roles. Not saying the acting was bad, i actually enjoyed the acting talent, but i did not like the character decisions. i just feel like there were alot of bad decisions as fars as &#34;How to survive&#34;. it's aggravatiig at times. thats the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5. .... maybe there will be a season two?
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Love this game can not stop playing it! Like that it makes you think. Its not just another mindless game.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Enjoyable read. The suspense of finding out why the sisters fell out of touch with each other and what happened between elizabeth and victoria kept me turning the pages quickly!  Loved learning about the language of flowers!  The heck with texting, let's send flowers!  LOL!
B0027MJU00|5.0|A great read. Kept me interested and had trouble putting it down.  I had a love/hate relationship with the characters. Highly recommend!
B00AFEXRME|1.0|this movie never gets going, it is Denzel's worst by far.  it just drags on til we turned it off about 3/4 of the way through it
B0052RDHTM|5.0|The characters were all well developed and you had to find out what would happen to them.  It was also a great history lesson.  I loved reading this!
098478280X|5.0|I really like this book. Very straight forward, jumps right into the purpose of the book, which is to prepare you for a technical interview. The key to any sort of success is information and this book provides it well. I fell in love with this book at Barnes and Noble and I immediately used the amazon price check app on my iPhone to buy it from amazon which was about 15$ cheaper than at B&N, immediately after I bought it I went right back to reading at the store. I kinda felt guilty doing it this way but I guess it's my way of getting back at B&N for not having wall sockets in their stores so you can't actually bring your laptop and study. This'll show them!!

As we soon find out while reading the book, Aslan intends to accomplish his mission at any cost, sometimes even at the cost of betraying logic and the very historical facts he claims to draw his conclusions from.<br /><br />Very early in the book, Aslan clearly lays out his thesis: Jesus was \\"a zealous revolutionary swept up, as all Jews of the era were, in the religious and political turmoil of first-century Palestine--[he] bears little resemblance to the image of the gentle shepherd cultivated by the early Christian community.\\" Then Aslan goes on to try to prove his theory and tells us: \\"Crucifixion was a punishment that Rome reserved almost exclusively for the crime of sedition. [...] Jesus's crime, in the eyes of Rome, was striving for kingly rule (i.e., treason), the same crime for which nearly every other messianic aspirant of the time was killed. Nor did Jesus die alone. The gospels claim that on either side of Jesus hung men who in Greek are called lestai, a word often rendered into English as `thieves' but which actually means `bandits' and was the most common Roman designation for an insurrectionist or rebel. Three rebels on a hill covered in crosses, each cross bearing the racked and bloodied body of a man who dared defy the will of Rome. That image alone should cast doubt upon the gospels' portrayal of Jesus as a man of unconditional peace [...]\\"<br /><br />Aslan goes on to give us a list of the names of the rebels, revolutionaries, and bandits of first century Palestine who saw themselves as \\"messiahs.\\" They took up arms not only against Rome but also against the chief priests of the Temple in Jerusalem.  The chief priests had deep pockets and exploited the population, deepening the gap between the rich and the poor. Some of the violent revolutionaries were Hezekiah the bandit chief, Simon of Paraea, and Judas the Galilean.  These men and their followers robbed armories and fought the Romansand the Jewish elite with swords, spilling blood.  Then came the Sicarii (Daggermen), zealots who \\"had begun their reign of terror. Shouting their slogan `No lord but God!' They began attacking the members of the Jewish ruling class, plundering their possessions, kidnapping their relatives, and burning down their homes. By these tactics, they sowed their terror into the hearts of the Jews so that, as Josephus writes, `More terrible than their crimes was the fear they aroused, every man hourly expecting death, as in war.'\\"<br /><br />Here, I will briefly break down some of  the flaws in Aslan's thesis:<br /><br />1. Aslan expects us to believe that because the other \\"messiahs\\" of the first century Palestine were violent zealots, so was Jesus. This is despite the fact that the most violent act Jesus ever committed was to overturn a few tables of money exchangers in the Temple in Jerusalem. A few pigeons and goats were freed, but, from what we can tell, no one was seriously hurt in the process.<br /><br />Jesus was, in a unique way, a revolutionary; his words and actions did not threaten the political establishment but challenged the priestly elite who used religion to get rich and gain more and more power. However, Jesus was not violent. On the contrary, what made him so dangerous was that he claimed his powers came directly from God, and he had his many miracles to prove this. Aslan admits that Jesus did perform many miraculous deeds like curing the sick, but he dismisses Jesus's miracles as \\"magic\\" and says that many other \\"messiahs\\" were doing amazing things during the first century. Aslan tells us that what made Jesus different was that, unlike the others, he performed miracles for free.  So, Jesus was indeed different from the rest. A question then arises: Why did Jesus perform his miracles for free when all the other healers charged for their work? If he were another violent revolutionary, wouldn't he need money to fund his movement and arm his disciples?<br /><br />To further prove that Jesus was a violent revolutionary, Aslan quotes the Gospel of Luke: \\"If you do not have a sword, go and sell your cloak and buy one.\\" (Luke 22:36) This sentence has been discussed thousands of times, and it feels ridiculously repetitive to talk about it again, but here goes. We have to look at this quote in its context: \\"And he said to them, `When I sent you out without purse and bag, you did not lack anything, did you?' And they said, `No, nothing.' And he said to them, `But now, let him who has a purse take it along, likewise also a bag, and let him who has no sword sell his robe and buy one. For I tell you that this which is written must be fulfilled in me, `And he was numbered with transgressors'; for that which refers to me has its fulfillment.' And they said, `Lord, look, here are two swords.' And he said to them, `It is enough.'\\" (Luke 22:35-38) Jesus was known for speaking in metaphors. Here, he's telling his disciples that even though during the time he has been with them, they have lacked nothing, the time will come, after his death, that they would have to take care of themselves and be well prepared for their difficult and challenging mission. If Jesus really meant to arm his disciples, would he have told them that two swords were enough? Two swords are enough for what exactly when facing the Roman Empire and the chief priests? Some \\"messiahs\\" who had picked up arms around the same time had robbed armories! In the Gospels and all recorded history of the life of Jesus, there is only one time when one of his disciples uses a sword. This happens at the time of Jesus's arrest when tens of armed men sent by the high priest, Caiaphas, come to the garden of Gethsemane, where Jesus and his disciples have taken refuge after the last supper. Peter panics, pulls a sword, and cuts off the ear of the servant of the high priest. \\"Then Jesus said to him, `Put your sword back into its place; for all those who take up the sword shall perish bythe sword.'\\" (Matthew 26:52) Are these the words and actions of a violent man? Jesus often preached about loving our enemies and praying for them.<br /><br />2. Because Jesus was crucified, we have to assume he was a violent revolutionary.<br /><br />As Aslan tells us, Pilate, the Roman governor of Palestine at the time of Jesus, was a coldhearted man who had no patience for any of the Jews' religious beliefs and especially for their \\"messiahs\\" who saw themselves as kings and thus challenged the power of Rome.  During his time as governor, Pilate had seen many so-called messiahs preach about the end of the oppression of the Jews, perform magical acts, begin violent movements, and spill blood. These actions destabilized the region and were a challenge to the power of Rome and the Emperor. It was Pilate's job to put an end to these movements with an iron fist once and for all, but they kept sprouting.<br /><br />The image that Aslan paints of Pilate sounds relatively accurate, but his conclusions are illogical.  There is more than one way to see the situation. For example: Pilate is the Roman governor, and he is cruel. In addition, he is fed up with the \\"messiahs\\" and their followers. The Jewish elite despise the Romans, but they have no choice but to work with the occupiers. After all, the top priests' main goal is to fill their pockets. The Romans can help them do just that as long as the Empire's share of the profit is guaranteed.  It is to the advantage of the priests and the Romans to get along and work together, but serious disagreements are unavoidable, and sparks fly.  When Jesus eventually finds his way to Jerusalem from the countryside, the priestly class is alarmed before the Romans are. Romans do not speak Aramaic, the language of Jesus, but the priests do. Jesus has not been violent, so, at least for the time being, he has not set off alarms for Pilate, who is quite busy being the governor of a difficult region. But, of course, Pilate has heard of the peasant who cures the sick and attracts large crowds.  However, this peasant has not picked up arms, so the Romans have tolerated him while they deal with more serious threats--and, by Aslan's own admission, there are many. The priests, on the other hand, are getting more worried by the day. Jesus has some dangerous claims. Even though he doesn't exactly call himself the messiah yet, he has directly challenged the power of the Temple and the priests. He has cured the \\"unclean\\" and has even forgiven their sins! The Temple priests have a complicated ritual when it comes to cleansing \\"unclean\\" individuals, a process that is financially lucrative for Temple authorities and demands that the \\"unclean\\" offer many sacrifices to the Temple. Who does this Jesus think he is? He might be non-violent, but he is extremely dangerous. After all, he has called himself the Son of Man. The other \\"messiahs\\" have never called themselves that. Jesus is different and a threat, yet the Romans are not aware of the terrible problems he can cause. The high priest, Caiaphas, takes it upon himself to make sure this threat is eliminated. In short, Jesus seems to represent a religious threat to the Jewish priests, not a political or military threat to the Romans.<br /><br />3. Aslan tells us that Jesus didn't call himself messiah or Son of God. Instead, in the Gospels, Jesus calls himself the \\"Son of Man\\" about 80 times, \\"an enigmatic and unique\\" title. Aslan traces the origin of the term to the Book of Daniel. Son of Man, at least in the context that Daniel and Jesus have used the term, doesn't just mean \\"human being\\"; it is much more than that. In a vision, Daniel sees \\"`the Ancient of Days' [God] sitting on a throne. Thousands serve him as he passes judgment, and this is when Daniel sees `one like a son of man coming with the clouds of heaven. He came to the Ancient of Days and was presented before him. And to him was given dominion and glory and a kingdom, so that all the peoples, nations, andlanguages should serve him. His dominion shall be everlasting; it shall never be destroyed.'\\" Aslan concludes that \\"because he [Jesus] failed to accomplish any of his messianic functions on earth,\\" early Christians came up with the idea that the Kingdom of God, which Jesus directly linked to his identity as the Son of Man, is not from this world.<br /><br />As Aslan quotes from the Gospels, Jesus \\"goes on to describe how the Son of Man must suffer and be rejected before being killed [...]\\" These hardly sound like the words of an ambitious and violent revolutionary who wants to oust the Romans and become king. If we go back to the description of the Son of Man in the Book of Daniel, we can easily see that the Son of Man, at least the way Daniel and Jesus see him, is not exactly a worldly figure and is not a \\"normal\\" king. Daniel's Son of Man comes with the clouds of heaven and stands next to God. The Son of Man has dominion and glory and a kingdom and all people eternally serve him. Jews knew very well that even the kingdom of David had ended. Eternity is Godly; it is not from this world. Aslan finds Jesus's descriptions of the Son of Man contradictory: \\"He is powerful (Mark 14:62) yet suffering (Mark 13:26). He is present on earth (Mark 2:10) yet coming in the future (Mark 8:38). He will be rejected by men (Mark 10:33), yet he will judge over them (Mark 14:62). He is both ruler (Mark 8:38) and servant (Mark 10:45).\\" Aslan sees all of these as contradictions, because he is trying to sell us the idea that Jesus wanted to become an earthly king. However, Jesus's message and approach are fundamentally different.  Let's put all the words that describe the Son of Man together: powerful, suffering, present, coming in the future, rejected by men, judge over men. When these words are put together, just like Daniel's description of the Son of Man, they vividly describe a king whose kingdom is literally out of this world and challenges old belief systems. This idea seems to confuse Aslan and sends him into ranting loops that make no sense. Aslan's problem is that he desperately tries to fit Jesus into the earthly mold of a violent man who uses the sword to get his way.<br /><br />4. Aslan claims that \\"The gospels present Pilate as a righteous yet weak-willed man so overcome with doubt about putting Jesus to death that he does everything in his power to save his life, finally washing his hands off the entire episode when the Jews demand his blood.\\" Aslan adds: \\"Either the threat posed by Jesus to the stability of Jerusalem was so great that he is one of only a handful of Jews to have the opportunity to stand before Pilate and answer for his alleged crimes, or else the so called trial before Pilate is a fabrication.\\" Basically, Aslan claims that either Jesus was a violent revolutionary whom Pilate insisted on executing, or the narrative of his trial in the Gospels is not true at all. In other words, if Jesus were not violent, it would simply mean that he was never brought before Pilate.<br /><br />What seems to be a fabrication here is not at all the Gospels' description of the last hours of the life of Jesus but is Alsan's conclusion. These are the same Gospels that Aslan quotes time and time again when he feels he can manipulate them to serve his agenda and prove Jesus to be a mere revolutionary armed with a lot of zeal and a sword, basically what we might call a terrorist today, more or less, a member of an Al-Qaeda style movement in the first century, fighting the Romans.<br /><br />As Aslan has quoted the Gospel of Matthew many times, I carefully read the part of it that has to do with the trial of Jesus. Aslan has claimed that it would have been impossible for Pilate to give a man like Jesus so much of his time, and that even if Jesus were brought in front of Pilate, his trial would have been very quick. Reading the Gospel of Matthew, it is difficult not to notice that Jesus's trial was indeed very short and arbitrary; the whole episode is described in about 6 lines, which Aslan calls it a long trial, and, as a result, a fabrication and a creation of the Gospel writers.<br /><br />5. Aslan writes that crucifixions were performed very often and served as a deterrent to others who might wish to defy the state. This is why crucifixions were carried out in public and usually on hills and at crossroads where everyone who walked by could see; \\"The criminal was always left hanging long after he had died; the crucified were almost never buried. Because the point of the crucifixion was to humiliate the victim and frighten the witnesses, the corpse would be left where it hung to be eaten by dogs and picked clean by the birds of prey. The bones would then be thrown onto a heap of trash, which is how Golgotha, the place of Jesus's crucifixion earned its name: the place of Skulls.\\"<br /><br />From what we can tell, it is true that the vast majority of those who were crucified were left on the cross, as Aslan tells us. But there are exceptions to almost any rule. The Gospels, which Aslan has quoted time and time again, tell us that \\"And when it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who himself had also become a disciple of Jesus. This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given over to him. And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock; and he rolled a large stone against the entrance of the tomb and went away.\\" (Matthew 27:57-60) Thousands of people had followed Jesus, and even though he had 12 main disciples, he had many friends and followers, some of whom were rich and powerful. He had cured many, and these individuals had families and neighbors. From this story, we can tell that Joseph cared deeply about Jesus, and this is why he gave him his own tomb. Pilate allowed it, as he probably just wanted to get done with this whole Jesus thing even if the main reason for it was that his wife had been nagging about it! There were many other corpses left on Golgotha to serve as a deterrent to dissidents and revolutionaries.<br /><br />6. Aslan writes: \\"Then something extraordinary happened. What exactly that something was is impossible to know. Jesus's resurrection is an exceedingly difficult topic for historians to discuss, not least because it falls beyond the scope of any examinations of the historical Jesus. Obviously, the notion of a man dying a gruesome death and returning to life three days later defies all logic, reason, and sense. One could simply stop the argument there, dismiss the resurrection as a lie, and declare belief in the risen Jesus to be the product of a deludable mind. However, there is this nagging fact to consider: one after another of those who claimed to have witnessed the risen Jesus went to their own gruesome deaths refusing to recant their testimony. That is not, in itself, unusual. Many zealot Jews died horribly for refusing to deny their beliefs. But these first followers of Jesus were not being asked to reject the matters of faith based on events that took place centuries, if not millennia, before. They were being asked to deny something they themselves personally, directly encountered.\\" Aslan goes on to tell us: \\"It was precisely the fervor with which the followers of Jesus believed in his resurrection that transformed this tiny Jewish sect into the largest religion in the world.\\"<br /><br />Indeed, many have dismissed Jesus's resurrection as a lie, and we can see that Aslan would have loved to do the same. Yet, as he puts it so well himself, there is a \\"nagging fact to consider.\\" Jesus's disciples, the ones who knew him personally and had claimed to have seen him after his resurrection, bore witness to what they had seen, even under torture and to horrific deaths. This is a truth worth pondering.<br /><br />History can be used and abused, shaped and reshaped. It is sometimes extremely difficult to separate fact from fiction, even when it comes to what happened last year, let alone two thousand years ago. Many times, we are left with not much more than witness testimonies. Are witness testimonies perfect and entirely accurate? No. Memory filters everything, emotions affect the way we remember, and trauma can distort images. Yet, there is something powerful about the witness, especially a witness who would rather die than recant his testimony. Maybe this is exactly where the truth lives in all its mystery.<br /><br />As other reviewers of Aslan's Zealot have mentioned, this book, which now sits on top of various bestseller lists, would not at all have received so much attention if it were not for the controversial Fox interview conducted by Lauren Green that has been viewed a million times on YouTube. Green demands to know why a Muslim such as Aslan should be interested in the life of Christ. To me, as a writer and reviewer, Aslan's religion doesn't matter. If I have issues with a book, I address them in a direct and civilized manner after reading all the book and carefully analyzing its arguments. It is amazing how many of the people who have very strong opinions about this book have not read it. But, there are a few well-written reviews about it available. For example, in his review of Zealot for The Telegraph, Nicholas Blincoe writes: \\"It is a politically charged interpretation with a grand narrative sweep but, too often, the decisions underpinning it feel arbitrary.\\"  And Stuart Kelly says in The Guardian: \\"To take just one example: the Romans are said to display `characteristic savagery' on page 13 and are `generally tolerant' on page 14. Aslan contends that an illiterate `day laborer' called Jesus was part of an insurrectionary tradition in Israel, and the story of this Che Guevara of the early Middle East was co-opted by the dastardly Saul of Tarsus, aka Saint Paul, who defanged the zealot and turned him into an apolitical metaphysician. Frankly, parts of it are closer to Jesus Christ Superstar than any serious undertaking.\\"<br /><br />Marina Nemat<br />Author of Prisoner of Tehran and After Tehran

1476734941|5.0|I read this book very carefully, since I was VERY skeptical.  I had been adhering to the \\"Eat 5 or 6 small meals\\" hype so that I could keep my metabolism in fat burning mode.  I see now that that's as big a crock as the whole low fat diet scam of the 90s where I ate disgusting Snackwells cookies and other low fat/high sugar processed junk thinking I was doing myself a favor.<br /><br />But this book completely convinced me that your body doesn't go into the dreaded starvation mode until you have fasted for days or maybe even weeks.  Certainly not after one day of low calorie eating.  It's just the opposite. A little hunger puts you into fat-burning mode.  And I can tell it's working.  I've lost 7 of my EXTREMELY stubborn 15 pounds that I've been trying to lose, in just 3 weeks, and it's not just water weight.  My measurements are smaller and people are asking me what my secret is!  I have more energy on both fast and feast days, and my stamina us up.  My exercise instructor said she was amazed at how much stronger I seem lately.<br /><br />Because of my new understanding of how hunger affects the body, on my feast days I don't feel like I have to rush to eat right when I'm hungry. I actually like to wait until I have a nice big appetite.  The food tastes better, and since I'm only eating 3 times a day I can really enjoy that bigger meal.  It fulfills me much more than those diet-y little meals I was eating before.  I think that's why I always used to fall off the healthy wagon.  I was never really satisfied.  Also, I don't stuff my face the way I would before if I got too hungry.  Before if I happened to get really hungry, I'd pig out, thinking that I deserved to really go crazy since I hadn't eaten all day.  Now I just see getting good and hungry as natural, and then I eat a reasonable amount.<br /><br />And all the little tips in the book really helped me figure out how to make the fasting days fly by.  The way I do it is that I drink coffee (with a little unsweetened almond milk and Splenda), Good Earth Tea (iced), lemon water, fizzy water and maybe chicken broth through out my busiest mornings.  Then I have scrambled eggs with cheese at 1:00.  A sweet potato with Greek yogurt and salsa at 4.  Then I go to bed early. The tip I like best is just reminding myself I can have whatever I want tomorrow.  Sounds trite, but it works like a charm.  I always think I'm going to have a burrito or a huge take-out spaghetti and meatballs, but when the next day comes, my appetite is so small I don't feel like eating it.  I also feel so light and healthy that it doesn't even sound appealing.  Last week I did have a big old Panda Express lunch and this week I had the spaghetti, but when I stepped on the scale the next morning I was lighter than ever!<br /><br />But for me, the best part is that I'm not on this awful diet roller-coaster.  I used to be \\"good\\" for about 2 or 3 days and then I'd be \\"bad\\" and ruin it.  Then I'd feel guilty so I'd eat more to make myself feel better, then I'd be good again, only to ruin it...  This is no way to live!  My feelings of self-worth should not be dependent upon what I eat!  This new approach isn't about being good or bad.  It's just eating or not eating.  It's easy for me to not eat when I only have to do it for one day.  I don't feel like I'm being \\"good.\\"  I just feel like I'm doing something good for my body.  And the next day when I indulge- if I even do, I feel like it's all part of my healthy plan.  I just know that this is something I can do forever.  I actually look forward to the fasting days as a chance to re-boot.  I also like to use the hunger pains to remind me to be live a life of compassion for myself and for others.

B00E1LTEG0|5.0|Before I saw this series, I did not know what The White Queen was about. I saw a trailer for it on TV and found that it was to be a TV series based on Philippa Gregory's novel of the same name. I knew of her work from the movie version of her novel The Other Boleyn Girl (a very inaccurate take on Tudor history), but have not as of yet read any of her novels based roughly upon between 15-1600's on the Tudor's and so fourth. I love Tudor history and more than that I love anything on the British Monarchy. I know a lot on Henry VIII and his wives as well as Queen Elizabeth I, but I did not have any knowledge onto the Plantagenet's or anything about the War of the Roses. So I jumped on this series and immediately began to watch it hoping it to be better than the Showtime series The Tudors.<br /><br />I have to say at first I wasn't sure I thought though while the story seemed to be intriguing, I wasn't falling for the main characters like King Edward and his wife Elizabeth in the first episode, but by the second and third episode of the series I was completely hooked. I know there are a lot of reviews from critics saying the series didn't hold up to the standards they expected, but I think a lot of that was based on the first episode alone in the series and not the story all together as a whole.<br /><br />I never realized how fascinating the War of the Roses was or what it was about. I think what makes this story so much more compelling to me versus other shows around the time period like The Tudors, is that it is told in the view of the woman who stood behind the throne and who shaped England's history dramatically without the world even realizing their importance to what was happening on the throne and how they could influence it. Unlike in The Tudors where it was more of a mans view on the world. Their are three main woman who shape the story over the period of ten episodes. You have the White Queen Elizabeth who was King Edwards wife, then you have Queen Anne who was Queen to King Richard III and you have Margaret who becomes the King's mother to Henry VII.<br /><br />These woman are each inspiring in their own ways. Elizabeth Woodhouse is a very strong character in the story. She's not afraid to voice her opinion and stand for what she says. She was also one of the first monarch's to have her children stay with her while they were growing up, where in all other noble families you would send them away for months or years at a time to be tutored and not brought back to live with their families till after their education was completed on how they were to behave as a future king or queen. While Anne in the beginning is very passive wanting to please her family and sister, she is caught in the middle as her father tries to get her older sister married to one of the brother's of Kind Edward and keeps being tossed aside till her father needs her in one of his schemes to take the throne. Through all of this she finds her strength and takes charge of her own destiny. While Margaret is devote to god and seeing her son put on the throne at such huge odds that when you think of it, it's amazing she achieved so much with so much in front of her, when the cards seemed stacked against her.<br /><br />What makes this series work so well are the different view points that are captured through the eyes of these woman. You can't help but feel for each one of them as they are pushed from one place to another, but each time this happens they rise again. What Philippa Gregory has done so well is she has shown 3 different view points of the same conflict and has shown us as the viewers different perspectives to the story line based on view you are looking at.<br /><br />This series is a fast pace series as far as time lapses go. Episode 1 starts off with the meeting and marrying of King Edward to Elizabeth Woodhouse. By episode two they are married and have children and by the end you are at the beginning of the Tudor era. Even though there are gaps by years in the show it flows so well together and the drama keeps you glued to the screen. You can't help but feel for these ladies in the show.<br /><br />As far as how accurate this series it to her books I don't know, how accurate it is to history I do not know either. What makes a great historical drama period piece is when a author knows how to weave the fiction on around the historical events that truly took place. I feel that as far as I can see Gregory has done just that, but just don't quote me completely on it! The magic of an author should be to captivate the audience and have have them wondering which parts are the fictitious and which are reality and when it comes to Plantagenet's history it can be hard to say what was fact and what was Tudor propaganda. Leading the reader or watcher to make up their own mind. Which is exactly what Philippa Gregory does.s by years in the show it flows so well together and the drama keeps you glued to the screen.

B00BGZ8OLA|4.0|This movie is like wine. As it gets old you will like it more. Every time I watch it I enjoy it and learn something new. The visuals are stunning and acting by Suraj is really good considering it is his first movie. I have read the book too. I felt the movie ends bit abruptly as opposed to book as if Lee was in hurry to wrap up shooting. Of course Martel had luxury of print media to elaborate story in detail. But anyways I enjoyed it thoroughly.

B001AQQR2S|5.0|I watched it on a whim and must say: what a lovely film !! Its definitely all &#34;Hollywood&#34; .... sad/ silly story with happy ending BUT it has heart !! After watching the movie all I thought was .... What a great movie !! Enjoy it with your kiddies or by yourself .... I did !! :-)

B002MQYOFW|5.0|great book a very different book i love the series they are great books i could not put this book down until i finished it
B003JTHXN6|4.0|I was hedging my bets on this Kindle book after reading some of the less-than-favorable reviews, some of which said that Tony simply wanted you to forgo everything else in your life except work, but that's not the message I got - what I think I got out of it, was that in order to make something of yourself in life, you have to take some chances, and oftentimes, persistence and hard work pays off.  Oh, a little bit of luck never hurt either, but I'd have a hard time believing that his success (or that of Zappos) was accidental in any way.<br /><br />If you are interested in the Zappos story, I think that this is worth your time - you're sure to get a whole more than just that if you read it - I know that I did.  And yes, I was inspired to become a Zappos customer, too!

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I use this all the damn time for my Google Play Music. I would like for HBO Go to be supported. Koush is doing some awesome work with this and I expect him to single-handedly make this an awesome accessory!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|One of the best hidden object games I've played. Sat at the edge of my seat the whole time! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!! Even younger players can manage to find their way around. You won't be disappointed!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think that there should be endermen added to the game but I love the updates. The game itself is AMAZING!!!!!!
B001S31MTQ|5.0|I got my book and week after I ordered it(I had the cheapest shipping option). It came in perfect shape, looking as though it had never even been touched by another human hand. The price was reasonable, the service was awesome, and the book is amazing. Will definitely buy from them in the future.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Once you start this book you can't put it down.  It's well done.  These were courageous and brave men who flew for their countries sake even though their equipment was very crippled at times.  I am glad they finally received the recognition they deserved.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I am 62-yr mother of three young adults and this summer my eldest suggested we have a family book club.  Taking turns choosing the book.  My 25-yr old son wanted us to read The Hunger Games series so there was no way I was going to refuse although I would have never thought of reading them on my own.  I had a good bit of &#34;mother's guilt&#34; motivation due to the fact that about 12 years ago my son had wanted me to read the Harry Potter books and I started but didn't finish.  No excuses and now finally I redeemed myself. My usual tastes run to memoir with relationship dynamics and true stories,Non-Fiction with some meat and history to it. I like novels but appreciate when the backdrop is real. I must say I was surprised how involved I became with the characters and how much I appreciated Katniss and her heart and integrity.I especially liked her design team, reminded me of a reality TV show at times reading like a script. As bizarre as the circumstances some how Suzanne Collins sold them and I believe in part because of the character development and keeping human emotions.  In particular, this middle book brought Katniss into celebrity status and life as she knew it begins to unravel. I actually was looking forward to the last book, reading some reviews to give me something to consider as I read. I finished all three book before my kids. Can't wait for my son to finish Mockingjay so we can have that conversation, unlike myself, my kids don't like spoilers!
B002KGKH5A|5.0|A quirky journey across Canada with an amazing band. Fabulous live stage sequences peppered with delicious behind-the-scenes moments. A must for WS fans, a compelling peek for others.
B00BEIYH6U|4.0|Just saw this in the theatre. I liked it. It's great to see a strong, confident, intelligent female superhero who doesn't have to wear skimpy clothes. Actually, I've always thought fighting crime in a bathing suit would be pretty stupid, leaving one very vulnerable. The movie looks at important concepts like the definition of \\"growing up\\"; the nature of childhood; the relationship between what is \\"real\\" and what it not; the tension of keeping the values of our parents and living our own. Plus it's funny, has satisfying action scenes, has believable and likable characters, and a good plot. The ending was a little bit disappointing; not because it was ambiguous but was just blah, a little dull. Overall, a good movie.
B008WOULPK|4.0|I think Grace Coddington is an excellent writer and as  someone who has been in the fashion business for many years she paints a true picture filled with many memories.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Good game......confusing sometimes as there are many things going on at once....but otherwise it's fun. I like G5 games...looking forward to more.
B001B68XRY|1.0|Not funny. Dumbest plot ever. Dialog is terrible. Acting is horrible. Don't bother. I would have expected more since I usually enjoy Adam Sandler--but not this time.
B008NMT684|1.0|It did not work.  After downloading and installing, it came up with an error message and never got to try it out.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Well what can I say, a heart felt story that made me laugh, cry get angry but not stop reading.<br />Define the word hero and I immediately think of Adam brown. Fantastic

B001BR7CZW|5.0|Is this rating a joke?  The movie is an ABSOLUTE, BONFIDE CLASSIC, of the comedic genre.  If you don't wet your pants watching it: better check for a pulse.
0881889148|5.0|I purchased this with volume one, and am very pleased.  The books split some of the &#34;I&#34; songs but the ones missing here are on volume two.  Since I purchased them together it was not an issue.  But if you are looking for an &#34;I&#34; song, you'd want to check out which ones are in which books.
B00634GHJA|5.0|This app is great. This is the easiest app I have used and tried to transfer pictures. Not hard to use at all.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I am having fun playing with a friend. I do find it amusing. Sometimes I am unable to get the lines to appear as I intended and find it much more difficult than drawing with paper and pencil.<br /><br />I would really like to know how the distribution of \\"coins \\" is determined. I have selected three coin words the vast majority of the time and the stats show my playing partner as having twice as many \\"coins \\" as I have. Are the coins alloted according to the person drawing's selection or according to the person guessing? If I draw a three coin object does my friend get the coins for solving it or do I get them for drawing it? It seems as though they should each receive them or it would be in the best interest of a player to draw easy objects if their opponent gets the coins.<br /><br />Regardless of the point distribution, I'm having lots of fun and would recommend it as a delightful pastime.
B004SVM7BW|5.0|Easy to use. Great app, the best I have tried, I have tried others and no other app compares to this one.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is fun. its a great way to pass time. for example waiting for someone. I love this. game!!!!!!!!
B002SGYPS2|4.0|I really enjoyed Jim Carrey in this movie. Also the concept of the movie is none I have seen before! Very enjoyable!
B0090X4GLW|5.0|Ok, so who wouldn't like this soundtrack?  The disc is a little short (played), but FUN nonetheless! My kids love to sing along with all the songs in the car...my husband and I are guilty as well.
B00637D114|5.0|I love the Smurfs! I've been a fan for years. I'm glad they are making movies for them now! I was surprised at the price however. Will I be able to watch it again now that it is in my video library?
B0001I561E|5.0|I haven`t seen this movie in a very long time and for some reason it was very hard to find it when I was able to afford it in a store. The dvd was new and very worth it, no damage at all.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Good stuff I say to you, those who like to follow the weather and know what to wear every day.
B0013ND30M|5.0|I love this movie. When I got the DVD, the box and disc were in great condition and the movie was great.
B004LROMWU|3.0|This fits into the post-alien-invasion world of science fiction. It's interesting, though I didn't seem to get the emotional tug with characters, many did seem rather clichéd. Still, with a baskets full of ironing to do, it was a good show that had me entertained.
B002UJIY7A|5.0|A murder mystery with Milla Jovovich on a tropical island,good acting and beatiful scenery. Keep a sharp eye out for Thor's Chris Hemsworth in an early role. Nice change of pace from Milla's typical work.
B0090SI582|4.0|Quick Review.<br />This movie is miles ahead of the original, as far as a comprehensive story being told, and if you consider the audience you know FOX made them adhere to (by going pg-13) this was a great flick. Enjoy it for what it's worth. Big respect for Hugh Jackman getting ripped after losing all that weight for Lesaw MIsllerbales (whatever).
B003G4W49C|5.0|Ender's game is a great book a must read ever one should read it. and it was a great price for the book.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|McConaughey is a talented actor, story holds your interest. Marissa Tomei adds to the picture too. Twists to the predictable plot helped
B0010SKSTO|5.0|I like the way Navarro shares his life experiences.  He shows how the smallest detail of body language can lead to a truth.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I've read it twice. Great story line. Lots of twists & turns & unexpected surprises. Great read for sure! Looking forward to the movies.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Perfect for people my age. Nice size lettering and easy to read and you can't beat the price. Any one 65 or olderthis is for you.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|With RSS Reader being shut down, I really enjoy using this app.  The transition was seamless.  The ability to open specific web pages within the reader operates quickly and without fail - in contrast to a different app for stumbling...
1452101248|3.0|I purchased the kindle edition of this book from Amazon.  Immediately I went for the Eggplant with Buttermilk recipe that I saw in the hard copy in the store.  After waiting much longer then it said for the eggplant to be done, we realized that the temperature was different in the kindle edition vs in the hardcopy edition.  200 vs 400 degrees.  This really made a difference.  This is the first recipe I made and already found a MAJOR typo.  So it came out ok, but since we ended up cooking at 200 degrees for an hour before we figured it out, it was a little dried out.
B00CHRB9RM|5.0|I've waited a long time for something like this to come out. The only thing missing from this collection is Berry's Tune, which I heard was not included because the master tape is missing. All in all a great collection.
1401938906|5.0|I found Pam's book to be marvelously entertaining and delightful but most of all a HUGE support for those of us who choose to become better creators of our lives!!!  I highly recommend it to everyone who desires change.

B00C2U6G7C|5.0|Being a fan of percussion and Hans Zimmer, I found this soundtrack CD to be awesome. I enjoy how the CD was presented and bits of the cast/crew were highlighted. I listen to it often. Great buy.
0316228583|3.0|J.K. Rowling's \\"Casual Vacancy\\" is a story about what happens in the small town of Pagford when Barry Fairbrother dies, how the people he knew coped, and who will take his place on the town council.  This is a very tragic tale that shows how everyone fights some sort of daily battle in their lives, whether against bullies, fear, addiction, loneliness, or society itself.<br /><br />The parts I wasn't fond of:<br />There's a large cast of characters (no main character) which made it a bit hard to keep everyone straight, especially early on. I also felt like the story got off to a very slow start in which the pace didn't pick up until after the midway point.<br /><br />The parts I enjoyed:<br />The last fifth or so of the book best showcases Rowling's writing, as numerous tragic events hit all at once.  I found myself unable to put it down when I came to this point, since I had to know what was happening to certain characters.  There were several twists that added to the plot, things I definitely didn't see coming.  Fats' character arc was very well done and impressive, and left me wanting to know where his life will take him next.<br /><br />I would recommend this novel to people who enjoy literary fiction centered around tragedy.  Ms. Rowling's writing is always well done, even if this story lagged in the first half.
B00B4FU6KE|2.0|The book contained interesting animal research science masked as a fiction. The science was interesting but the fiction writing was poor.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|I Bought it for my grandson and he really loves to play it when riding in the car with me.
B00CBT04LI|5.0|I wanted to see this in the theater when it came out originally and missed it.  Then I saw it streaming on Amazon and it was so good I bought the bluray.  This movie is so worth the $4 is spent on streaming and the additional $9 I spent the same day to get the bluray.  Watch them in story order (reverse chronological) and you will see the movies' continuity is almost perfect (the only discrepancy is the alien space ship, which is way different in the new one than the old one), right down to the hole in the ice, the burned-out encampment and the exact same helicopter chasing after the dog to kill it at the end of new one and the beginning of the old one.  You won't be disappointed by thus movie.
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|it could of been better the first season was really good i thought it was a better story plus it might have been a little too disturbing
B009KY5OGC|5.0|Such a good book revealing the true history of the First Nation peoples in America. Sad and riviting at the same time.
B00C1CO0XS|2.0|As much as I like George Benson, I did not like this CD.  Nat King Cole may have been a great singer but his songs do not move me like George Benson's songs.  Wish George had done some new material.  I wasted my money!
B007THA4FI|5.0|I've read the Harry Potter Series multiple times so I was, of course, excited for this book. It was a little slow starting, but then had me hooked. Growing up in a small, pretentious town I can say that J.K. hit the nail on the head. She also was able to get me so invested in the characters that I cried more than I probably should have, but I wouldn't expect anything else from the \\"queen.\\"
B00BZW5W3W|5.0|What can I say.  Maysa has outdone herself.  That smooth, smokey voice has taken this CD to new heights.  I love  &#34;Good Morning Sunrise&#34; because it brings her back to where it all began.  Outstanding project!
B00E8TVHBA|5.0|My daughters, 7 and 9, can watch it over and over. They know all the dances and all the songs.

B00125JP1C|1.0|Watched this trash briefly on the plane .i didnt finish it,as it was poorly directed,plot was sub preschool and the cast did it obviously for money.mr owen i lost my respect for you and will never patronize any of your movie.i hope you and the producers will be featured on \\" american greed\\" show in the very near future as you have duped thousands ,of their precious time and money.furthermore,i am in disbelief that more and more stupid people ,who have raved highly of one of the worst movies of all time!
B004J09ONG|5.0|A true story to warm the heart. This was a family friendly film. My kids & I loved this movie.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|Much better than I expected. Got hooked early and stayed that way to the end. There's a lot to this move that you'll miss if you're not paying attention. Lots of good stuff.

B0050DZN4K|4.0|even though i still miss google reader- i am starting to get use to feedly. I like how you can organize your blogs into &#34;folders&#34; so I can read just the topic I select or read my entire feed depending on my mood. I like that its customizable with theme and color. I'm just not fully use to it yet as I was a google reader user for way to long.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I enjoyed all the books.SPOILER ALERT I was disappointed that Danny was involved in Alina's death. Hated that. Glad that Mac and Jericho finally got together. All the questions were answered and it ended well.
B005PWPW8I|5.0|While ALL of the Jack Reacher books are hard to put down and capable of costing one a night's sleep, the most entertaining aspect for me is the geographical component.  It would be fascinating to have stories set in each different state...and so far Child has hit a number of them.  I usually have my Rand McNally Road Atlas handy to verify the descriptions Child puts in each novel.  It lends a realism that many authors eliminate.  I can usually pinpoint the approximate location ( town names, military bases, etc are fictional), but the location is spot on.  Corinth, MS in this novel is so close to a relative's home, that I felt like I missed the prison, the military base and the actual town!  I love these books and unfortunately, I am reading them faster than Child can write them!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Very good movie. Interesting from start to finish. Can't wait for the sequel. Jennifer Lawrence is very talented. I've watched this movie twice
B008X9Z3UC|3.0|This Belkin case is nice in that it is inexpensive, light weight, and won't take up extra room in your bag/backpack/purse when covering your Kindle.  The problem is that the corners are not protected when your Kindle is zipped up inside.  As you can see from the pictures I uploaded, there is a thin gray \\"cord\\" type foam bumper that runs the length of the zipper on both sides of the interior of the zipper.  If you PULL the zipper outward while zipping it up, you might think that these two \\"cords\\" come together and overlap the edge of the Kindle so that when it is zipped up, they protect the edges and corners.  Unfortunately this is not the case.  These \\"bumpers\\" pull back away from the edges and leave the Kindle's corners and edges in direct contact with the inside of the zipper.  So basically if you drop the Kindle on any of the three corners or sides that are covered by zipper, the only thing standing in the way of damage is the zipper itself (in other words, not much).<br /><br />Also, if you are right-handed, the zipper seems like it is backwards in comparison to the Belkin logo.  Either that, or the logo is upside down, or this is a \\"left handed\\" case (e.g. you hold the case with your right hand and zip with your left).  A minor point, but it seems like a detail that was missed.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you just want a simple inexpensive case for scratch protection that won't take up much space, this is a good unit.  If you want protection from drops, then I suggest you look elsewhere.
B00BRH2MN8|5.0|Was searching for some new music and stumbled across Lorde.  She has an impressive vocal range and uses it well to create dynamic and interesting sounds.  The musical composition is great overall.  So glad I found this, and am looking forward to her first full album release!

B0050DZ8J0|2.0|What started out as a professional plus has become tainted.  The linked in system inundates participants with messages asking you to praise another participant for some aspect of their noted qualifications.  You may know the other person, but chances are you don't know the value of their abilities unless they work with you.  A mechanical engineer cannot qualify an acquaintance's writing ability. A secretary cannot qualify the abilities of a architect simply because of their acquaintance. The approval messages you receive become annoying.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I'm not an audiophile, and I really don't need this headphones ... but I wanted to splurge on something high quality for my ears. These headphones are amazing. I use them while gaming, and I can pretty much hear everything. I love the bass these headphones give off. Additionally, they come in a neat, padded box. I'm very careful with these, however, because I don't want the cord to pull out and stop working. I bought these headphones 2 years ago, and so far so good. The cups for the ears are very comfortable (although, like any headphone, they can get hot after a while). The only con I see is the way the adjustable area will slide up and down on its own, because it slides so smoothly. I would buy these again though.

0446547638|5.0|Chocolate Chocolate Moons author Jackie Kingon thought this was a very well written novel. The characters were real and the plot moved swiftly. I loved the Notebook better but this is really a good read. Deserves to be on the best seller list.[[ASIN:1477561803 Chocolate Chocolate Moons]]
B00DURILJ2|4.0|A good story, good acting, the teens were great also.  Interesting concept and great for the whole family to watch.
B0064MGU98|4.0|Has a lot of intrigue and will keep you on the edge of your seat.  I also appreciate how the characters are complex and not necessarily &#34;good&#34; or &#34;bad.&#34;  It shows that people's lives are complicated and that there is more happening beneath the surface than meets the eye.
1442359919|5.0|This one is a bit YA, kind of PG-13, not necessarily a bad thing. It's a coming-of-age story/tale. Simple, just under 300 pages. One of King's shortest novels written to date. Am I alone in perceiving that King has recently been on a hot streak? There used to be some debate about whether he was past his peak. I thought this was fun, was seductive, was scary. This is about a guy who's just trying to live a quiet life. He's a heartbroken college student, chasing the wrong girl/going through a rough breakup/dealing with a lot of stuff.<br /><br />I've read upwards of two dozen King books, so precognitive children don't feel particularly original to me, plus our main character aspires to be/becomes a writer. Also there is one of these radio cum TV preachers, hail, brimstone and fire. Could it be..a Stephen King novel? However, what I roll my eyes at is the cover. Which is, nevertheless, awesome.<br /><br />I have no opinion on the e-book snub aspect, I don't know what's going on w/that. Publicity ploy crossed my mind. Or, is the story one of those<br />property told on a page or by an actual voice? If so, it might be because the amusement park is a character in itself, the book has a carny spirit. I'll consider further, the idea of publishing stories/novels, only in certain formats, for the purposes of creating an atmosphere. King, I suppose, goofs w/this, we know.<br /><br />In conclusion, I'll mention that there is a rousing cold case mystery here, for fans of mystery books. There's also a ghost story, which of course<br />is well-tuned, but pretty light. I listened to it while on a treadmill, but figuratively, I'll call it a one sitting read, quick and easy, pure vintage King.
B0092QITO2|3.0|I liked the movie - I think it's because I never watched the original version which everyone swears is superior.<br /><br />But I did not like the Blu-ray copy.  It's more expensive and it comes with nothing special.  The digital copy won't work with iTunes so I can only watch it on my desktop and not off any other device like my phone or TV or tablet.  Pretty lame, Sony.
1465408746|5.0|I'm a big fan of Star Wars universe, so i was really exited, when i found this book here. I've preordered it immediatelly.<br /><br />Really great book with a lot of interesting information.<br /><br />Must have for any Star Wars fan.
B009AMAJVO|4.0|Loved. This. Movie.<br /><br />But the digital copy is Ultraviolet so it doesn't seem to work with iTunes and the bonus/additional features were pitiful.  You get more information from Access Hollywood.  But, the movie was good.  If I knew then what I know now, I'd just get a bare-bones DVD without paying for the extra stuff and buy a digital copy off the iTunes store.

B009XIXVU6|4.0|Khaled Hosseini  writes very well.  I had a hard time putting this book down.  A good summer time read.  I am waiting for more of his books.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I rate this product, THIS BOOK, with 5 starts<br /><br />I consider that Sheryl Sandberg is a very good writer who gives women of all walks a great opportunity to learn to lean in and face life.<br /><br />The examples are real; the experiences she shares with the reader are . impacting and you  can feel that  you were in a similar situation sometimes.<br /><br />I also like that she gives examples of how men act and behave and how some men do appreciate the work and effort women fulfill at home and in the workforce.<br /><br />It is very important to notice that Sheryl Sandberg is always showing the mistakes that  some women make, even her own mistakes, and how important it is to learn from those mistakes and lean in anyway.
B001BKTEZA|5.0|I read this book when I was in high school and had enjoyed it then.  As an adult I found it to be one of the most powerful books I have ever read.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Entertaining and fun.  It makes you think. The graphics are amazing.  My whole family has enjoyed this game. We take turns when we get stalled.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|I gave this show a try after reading a couple of reviews and I am very glad I did.  Greatly done, it has a story line that builds intensely throughout the first season and now I cannot wait for more.  If you are a thriller/Sci-Fi fan, give it a try!
B006LSZECO|4.0|It's a good murder/mystery and I like the way it's written from the two character's view.  You really won't know what's going on until pretty late in the book and even then it could go several different ways.  Some of the dialogue about men who look for certain types of women, perfect, and the women who pretend to be those types of women certainly made you think about some of the \\"perfect\\" women you may have known over your lifetime who implode at some point.  Just what does pretending to be someone or something you aren't do to a person?  And what do they do to the person they were pretending for? There were some weak points in the story but overall I enjoyed it and look forward to another by this author.
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|I've had my eye on this gun for a long time and finally picked it up at WalMart when I saw it marked down to $25 because the box was badly damaged. I couldn't believe my eyes, what a deal! Who cares about the box? Anyways, I can't stop laughing and smiling about this NERF gun. When I shoot it, I open my mouth like I'm a screaming madman in the Vietnam War. I'm an adult but thoroughly enjoy the ridiculousness of this gun. Well worth $37, or my $25.<br /><br />By the way, the NERF longstrike (NERFs longest gun) goes for $200 now. Can you imagine how much the Hail Fire will be worth when it's discontinued? Probably at least $100.
B00C7TAF3Y|1.0|I've been waiting for this game for a long time, but clearly there will be no version for the Kindle Fire first gen tablets.  Just another ploy to get you to spend more money on an upgrade you don't really need.  The only reason I realized it won't work on my device is because I read the reviews first.  This was not at all clearly stated in the game documentation.  Very disappointed.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This beautiful game helps relate to your every techniques  used and proven by professionals. I have considered purchasing a horse.
B00BOXZAG6|5.0|I want to start by saying this movie is a romantic fantasy and it is a<br />superb, beautifully crafted, incredible movie. This is the kind of<br />movie that really uses this medium (cinema) to help us travel to<br />imaginary and impossible places and situations.<br /><br />People examining the physics in this movie are starting with the wrong<br />foot, this movie is like a dream meant to be enjoyed. The images in<br />this movie are like extraordinary postcards and will be hard to forget<br />due to its beauty and detail.<br /><br />The sets in this movie are beyond words and the acting is outstanding.<br />The romantic couple is fantastic together.<br /><br />I wish there were more movies with this kind of genuine and imaginative<br />subjects.
B001QE9WEO|5.0|I am very happy with my purchase. The movie loaded fast, I did not run in to any problems. The movie had good picture quality.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I wish more books were like this. It moves along quickly, but is very well written. It is an extremely positive story and very enjoyable. I think everyone should read this at some point in their life.
1781162646|5.0|Stephen King reigns king as the master at character development, making the carny life real, without all that sleaze I stereotypically expect.  While I felt no connection to the lead Devin Jones, I was certainly compelled to finish his story.<br /><br />I thought the storyline of the cold-case murder was second fiddle to the characters and time period.  Joyland felt authentic in its portrayal of the 1970's amusement park and the people who worked backstage.  The dying child drama tugs at the heart, but a moment of triumph is found in the grace and courage the boy faced death.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I'm using this for my iPhone 5 and my iPad. So far, it works great with both. I just make sure to put my iPhone in the apple charging port and the iPad in the android charging port.
1878424319|5.0|A beautiful book.  Will help anyone who truly seeks to find their personal freedom.  Very insightful and I have recommended this book to many people.  I have lent mine to over 10 people.  maybe time to buy another.
B00AEDDSTI|4.0|Coming to Thailand and not reading Alex Garland's \\"The Beach\\" is like going to the Louvre and not waiting in line to see Mona Lisa. There is no doubt that Alex Garland was highly influenced in his writing by William Golding's \\"Lord of the Flies\\" and Joseph Conrad's \\"Heart of Darkness,\\" two books that deal with the barbarism of human nature. The Eden community of the beach will eventually find itself in the same situation as the children from \\"Lord of the Flies,\\" lashing spears and knives at each other while Richard's final encounter with Duffy brings \\"Heart of Darkness\\" into focus.

B00005JLKB|4.0|Superman has always been one of the squarest superheroes of all time thanks to his unflagging sense of nobility and his unwavering moral compass, not to metion his super skill set which allows him to do just about anything.  Without any true angst guiding his actions and no real sense of mortality, he's a fairly bland hero.  If anything, he's more of a symbol than a man.  So a series devoted to his formative years never really sparked my interest.  But over a decade after it first debuted, I found myself finally entering the world of Smallville and ending up pleasantly surprised with its imagination and heart.<br /><br />The series focuses on the midwestern town where a young Clark Kent grew up before heading to Metropolis and becoming The Man of Steel.  Tom Welling has the lead role and he does a fine job of portraying the hero in waiting as a normal teen with extraordinary gifts who just wants to be normal and fit in with his friends.  Those gifts include super strength, invincibility and x-ray vision among others, and Clark is tasked with the unenviable burden of keeping them a secret for fear of unintentionally hurting someone or being exploited and treated as a science expirement.  In addition to that responsibility, he also deals with his feelings for Lana Lang, forges an uneasy friendship with a young Lex Luthor and fends off a series of Smallvillians who have been given various powers by the same meteor shower that brought him to Smallville.<br /><br />The first season sticks closely to that premise and the result is an extremely entertaining and genuinely sincere portrait of adolescence and all of the complications and expectations that come with it, especially when you are destined for greatness and don't have any idea how to deal with it.  It seems the greatest superhero of them all had his share of apprehension and confusion after all.  Being a hero isn't supposed to be easy and Smallville's first season is a refreshing reminder of that very fact.
1592407889|1.0|If you enjoy reading 3 pages of a girl having her period, this book is recommended. And every man introduced in the book (including her father) will either have sex with her or want to. Maybe sex sells but this garbage turned me off and I skipped all the sex scenes. The remaining narrative is either dull, narcissistic or idiotic (a name her dad supposedly calls her all the time as a child). Why she goes ahead with her demanding fiancé's family's idea of a $20,000 wedding instead of doing what SHE wanted (under a tree barefoot--yeah, right!) then going begging her parents to pay for it because her fiancé's family never offers a penny? What kind of bride does that? Because she's \\"Japanese\\"-raised she acts like a slut? Maybe just low self esteem but please don't brag about it! What an insult to Japanese women everywhere. You will not like her after you read it. If you're going to lie, at least make yourself better not downright unlikeable.
B005BGBPBG|3.0|I read the trilogy and was looking forward to watching the movie.  I LOVED the books and was disappointed in the movie.  I thought the acting was great thought.  The characters were believable.

B00BHNQ5XK|2.0|Quick synopsis of the film (No Spoilers): A writer moves his family to a new town to get closer to the source of a story he is writing.  Most of the true horror revolves around a set of old 8 millimeter film rolls he finds in his attic.  Upon further investigation, he realizes that he has bit off more than he can chew and things get all kinds of wacky.<br /><br />Sometimes I like to watch a movie without knowing anything about it beforehand.  I had no idea who made Sinister, or who acted in it. All I had heard was that it was a good movie, so I went for it.  I had no hopes, no expectations, no idea of what I was getting into, I just wanted to watch a movie. I'm not exactly a film snob, but I don't like stupid movies and it takes a lot to actually scare me.  With that said, the first twenty or thirty minutes of this film were truly, truly scary.  My girlfriend was huddled up against me and we both jumped out of our skins a few times and I got frightened enough that I had to get up and make sure all our doors were locked.  The idea of a home invader is a terrifying thought that most people can relate to.  I think we can all agree that the idea of someone filming us from the bushes and then drowning us in our own swimming pool is pretty scary.<br /><br />  The main character(Ethan Hawke) goes through the film rolls (much like \\"8 MM\\", starring Nicolas Cage) watching them, taking notes and trying to keep his lunch down.  Each film has it's own unique, haunting soundtrack which I thought was a really brilliant touch.  But once he has watched all the films, the movie itself is over.  At least for me, it was.  From there, it develops into a hodgepodge of messy cliches and childish nonsense.  It was amazing how suddenly the movie went from truly terrifying, to laughable.<br /><br />**** SPOILERS AND BIASED OPINIONS, AHOY! ****<br /><br />This movie could have been so good.  So Effing Good.  The police officer that becomes friends with the writer and funnels him information about the murders could have been the murderer the whole time and that would have been good!  He was strange enough that you were wondering what he was up to, but likable enough that you didn't worry about it. Bam! Perfect set-up for a psychotic killer! But his character went nowhere. Absolutely nowhere. Instead, it turns out the real murderers were the children that were missing from each case.  Wow, what a surprise, what a twist, etc..  And of course, it would have been too much for our fragile, weak minds to handle if it was just the children killing by their own accord, so we have to bring in a demon that has possessed the children to do his evil bidding. Everything about the ghost-children was junk, from the way they \\"creepily\\" turned their heads in unison, to how they held up their fingers to their lips making the \\"hush\\" motion at the end of the bonus footage(how convenient that was, by the way!), to their horrible makeup. I don't know where this obsession with children as monsters came from but it needs to end.  It's not scary and hasn't been since the 1970's or 80's.  Stop it.<br /><br />As for the demon, he wasn't even a character.  He had no lines and no apparent motive.  Someone just decided to put a member of Slipknot in the movie to get a few cheap jump-scares.  By the way, I had NO IDEA that his face was going to pop up in the final shot before the credits, I was surprised because I didn't see that coming a mile away, at all, etc.<br /><br />\\"Se7en\\" and \\"Zodiac\\" are examples of good horror movies because the horror is real and there's no paranormal cop-outs. Paranormal movies were good, once upon a time, but not in this day an age. Sinister could have been good(and it was really good for twenty-some minutes), but it quickly turned into garbage. Movies like this are the reason I don't buy movies anymore, and instead, turn to pirated formats.<br /><br />Rant End.

B0064NTZJO|5.0|Drive was probably one of the most under-rated films of 2011.  No splashy marketing budget, no major commercial appeal but the movie just works.  With a mix of subdued ambiance, subtle acting and retro soundtrack, this movie will definitely not appeal to everyone but if you appreciate great movie-making you'll probably enjoy it.  A great cast with Gosling, Albert Brooks, Christina Hendricks and Ron Perlman, they twist their characters in ways that will surprise you.  Toss in the hyper-violence that makes several appearances throughout the movie and you'll have an engaging film that keeps your mind and senses moving along.  Their is a bit of 80's kitsch and cheesiness that makes Drive the type of movie that could have come out 25 years ago in a good way.<br /><br />I love this film and have watched it MANY times and I'm always amazed at how it's been shot and produced.  If you're a fan of the Fast and the Furious (the movies that critics often compare it to), you may not like Drive due to its slower pacing and subtlety.  But if you've got an attention span and film tastes beyond 12th grade, you'll probably love this movie.  Drive is a great mix of atmosphere, violence and romance all set against the City of Angels.  Definitely a worthwhile flick even without Vin Diesel...
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|I love this game.  It is entertaining but doesn't get frustrating because you have to do things quickly or get too hard to complete. The game play is smooth and the animations are cute without being too long and disrupting game play.

B000QCS8TW|5.0|This book while amazing and one of the best fantasy books written in the 21st century is nothing like Tolkien. Thank goodness for that because if it were poor Gandalf would have state  dead, Frodo would have been killed by the spider and Aragorn would have choked on his dinner. Don't read this book if you suffer from depression or you are offended by sex and rape (being either talked about or shown). If you aren't offended and enjoy books that aren't predictable then this is the book for you. It will take time (a week if your like me and have nothing else to do). You can't read the first book and not want to read the next one.

Thomas Newman does a great, great job with this soundtrack.  I play it in the car while driving and let's just say I take turns very sharp turns like a pro driver.  The music makes me do it.  Excellent.  by the way, if you know the soundtrack to Nemo you will hear a bit of it in this cd.  kidn of funny when you hear it.

B003G4W49C|4.0|I had seen the movie advertisements. I thought for the price it was worth the read. I was expecting something more of action packed thriller. Instead it was more of a political satire with psychology. It is about a young boy's interactions as he is made into a leader of men. In short if your looking for an exciting space faring adventure of aliens and gunplay, choose another book. If you are interested in how humans think and are looking for a little political satire this book is right up your alley. Another note, don't bother to get a sample. It is nothing more than the author's introduction.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I am enjoying the soft sounds, it's very relaxing to me, I like the different combinations of sounds you can put together
B008X9Z37A|5.0|This Kindle case is great.  I like it a lot for when I am reading because it opens just like a book.  I got it for a great price too.  It slips on very easy and there is not hassle trying to fit the Kindle in it.  I like that its solid classic black color.  It does not prop up but I got it to read and to cover the screen so it does exactly what I wanted it to do so I am very happy.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|There are so many love-hate reviews for this hyped up book that I almost didn't leave one simply because this review will in all likelihood will get lost in the other sea of reviews, but whatever - Pinkdiamond had to put her two cents in this one, anyway.<br /><br />With that said, I'm giving this one three-stars because I thought the author made everything too perfect on the surface. With Christian Grey's looks and financial resources, virtually any woman would have fallen for him. Sure, he's emotionally scarred but your average red-blooded woman wouldn't have thought twice about being used the way he wanted to use Anastasia, especially since the dunce was apparently too obtuse to see that Christian was slowly, but surely coming around to giving her the chance at true romance she really wanted (I'll get on Anastasia in a minute). My point is that there is nothing terribly extraordinary about this story that hasn't been told a million times before about a man in his position. At every turn Christian was showing off what he had and what he could afford and trying to woe Anastasia this way along the way with that and his sex appeal, which of that he had plenty - I'll give him that (the sex in this is mouth-watering, if not repetitive). But in the end, I felt Christian's charisma was measured in $$ and had nothing to do with his actual personality. I just wasn't blown away by him.<br /><br />I would have been more interested in reading a story about a man with the same issues had he been your everyday meat and potatoes type of man who possessed a more mysterious type of allure that got him the attention and submission he wanted. I would have liked him to not look like a Ken doll and more like the kind of guy who might not have turned many heads at all at first look. This guy would be the type who didn't use Mac books and helicopter rides to say what's already obvious from the start - you've got money, we get it. No, this guy would attract women with maybe no more thana stare and tip of a cap or maybe the light glisten of sweat beading his strong neck through his open collar as he swallowed his drink after a long day at work.<br /><br />But in all fairness, the rose-colored image doesn't stop there. You have Anastasia's best friend, Kate, who gets the consolation prize in Christian's brother, Elliot. I don't know why this irked me so bad, but it did. I guess I just kind of felt it was excessive to include Kate in Anastasia's good fortune. I mean, why was it necessary for a girl who was purported to have it all by default (she, too, came from money - although maybe not Christian's kind of money) to have to have a piece of Anastasia's world, also, even if it was by association? I found their relationship superficial and not very realistic at all. I mean, Kate is head over heels about Elliot and here there's been absolutely nothing between them but sex all this time. I don't know - hated it!<br /><br />Okay, lastly - that Anastasia steele! She pissed me off so bad. I stopped and started this book twice because of it. I thought she was quaint and stupid, to say the least. I mean she had zero appeal whatsoever and yet we're supposed to believe that she's The One. This is the one who is making this enigmatic man throw all of his reservations about life and love out of the window? Yeah, right.<br /><br />This woman didn't have a confident bone in her body and she was rendered absolutely stupid in Christian's presence. Every little thing the man did from run his hands through his hair to the way he spoke during a phone conversation caused her to lose composure - it was nauseating. She's a bottle of contradictions and didn't know which way was up or down when dealing with Christian. And if that wasn't infuriating enough - we're supposed to believe that none of the extravagant gifts he gave her - like a brand new Audi! - impressed her? Please - just please.<br /><br />In the end, I only read this book because as an avid reader of erotica Icould no longer ignore all of the attention this book got. Can I say it was worth the hype? I gave it three-stars so, uh, no. Aside from the things I mentioned above, the same scenes kept repeating themselves - Anastasia has sex with Christian, she emails Christian, she talks to Kate about Christian; repeat. Besides the ending isn't really an ending and demands that you read the next book in the trilogy. Simply because by the end I did find myself feeling sorry for a certain pompous character, I probably will read the next, but it won't be anytime soon. I'm just not that eager to get to the bottom of Mr. Grey and that's not even if he did threaten to spank me.

B004IQMXD4|2.0|Sorry. I adore Stevie Nicks but this CD misses the mark. I found the lyrics very contrived/superficial and the melodies repetitive, perhaps due to her collaboration with Dave Stewart.

B0041D843M|5.0|I consider it great because of the courage it must have taken Dr. Campbell to talk about this. He goes up against his own profession, the medical-pharmaceutical-political establishment, and lays out the forces at work in our society that prevent health and longevity. I was impressed. The book has enriched my life.
B00BB8OHMW|3.0|Being kind giving this 3 stars but the premise was a good one the writing was well intended and it hit all the marks (romance, action, suspense and gender confusion).<br />Enough said
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Read all others in hard copy but this one I used the cloud to download it. The only problem with reading in on a tablet is that when I want to see a map of where the people in the book are I can't easily access it (or haven't figured out how to yet). Same with the end of the book where they give all the houses and who belongs to each. Cannot access this either. Had to go to Amazon today and had to &#34;Look Inside&#34; at the first few pages of the book so I knew what was where. Normally having to flip to the beginning or end of a book is not a problem but with this story not being able to flip back and forth is an issue.
1451626096|4.0|A wonderful, entertaining book about Elizabeth of York. Well written and researched. Interesting details about her life. The life of the mother of King Henry VIII and grandmother of Queen Elizabeth I. The book focuses on her life as Henry VII's wife. It was not an easy life for her. She was forced into marriage with Henry. She had seen first hand how hard a queen's life could be. This, along with the fact that she was mourning her lover Richard III, made her reluctant to marry. Her life as queen was often overshadowed by her mother-in-law ruling along with Henry VII. Her life with her husband does change and grow, taking many twists and turns.<br />There is another very interesting story told within this book about what may have happened to one of the princes in the tower. That story provided mystery and drama.<br />Overall, a very enjoyable book.
B0090SI4OC|4.0|I read a lot of science fiction in my youth -- half a lifetime ago -- but not much recently. I was pleasantly surprised by the book; I thought it had more depth than the Twilight series, which I only read because my daughter was into it, really! But one of the strengths of the book is that it is very psychological -- very much about the minds of the characters. This doesn't come across nearly as well in the movie, so I don't think the movie stands that well by itself. As a visualization of the book, though, it's pretty good.
B0051OZ564|4.0|OK, alot of people lost the fact that we are actually you are in a 1st level of dream state followed by a second level in the action scenes.  Realty is shown only at the begining and end of the movie.  Everything else was her imagination or dream state to deal with the reality.  The movie is a good if you just accept it for what it is, an escape of our reality for a while.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|Ive tried some of the experiments with good results. the way it is written makes it very easy to read and understand. thumbs up
B0092QITO2|3.0|This film is a standard sci-fi remake. Instead of Mars the downtrodden work in a &#34;colony&#34; connected to their living quarters by a large<br />tube. It closely follows The original using the same names  and circumstances. It's not as good as the original and would have been better off disassociating itself from the original. The special effects are O.K. and doesn't take away from the story
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I was surprised at how challenging this was!  Most floors I was able to get thru without a problem but I had to get some help on a couple of floors. Loved it!
B00EI6E17A|5.0|Best I've heard from her! Love applause, is incredibly addictive after a couple listens. Extremely excited for ARTPOP after this and the aura/burqa  !
B008AK8FHM|3.0|i thought this book would be another bright light explanation story. however, the difference is the credibility factor and in the last chapter you discover irrefutable truth theres more to this world than meets the eye. if your a doubter, youll have your work cut out for you after reading this.UPDATED: The night I wrote this review, i gave it 5 stars. However, I googled the author to find out more. I was really excited about this book. However, after googling dr. Alexander, I ran aross an article in Esquier magazine that was less than flattering. It called into question Dr. Alexanders' credibility, which was the strongest aspect of the excitement. The dr who treated him said he was in a medically induced coma and WAS able to thrash about and hallucinate, which contradicts dr alexanders words. I believe these things happen, I just have my doubts about dr alexander now. Such a bummer.
B00CAYHVKQ|5.0|Well worth a read if you are interested in realising your dreams :-) enjoy doing the experiments in the book!
B009G41CG2|5.0|I have to get my fix every day.  It keeps my thinking process going.  I don't have another game like it in my library so it goes where I go.  I can spend a little or more time with it depending  on how much I have open at that moment.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Not as User friendly as last version.  Poorly thought out. Who decided it was better. I want old one back.
B004SBQGHS|3.0|I have seen other people playing this game and wondered about it so I bought it when I got my new Fire HD.  I enjoyed it OK.  I think it is a lot of luck for me to go from one level to the next and not skill.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|Best sci-fi movie I've seen in a long while. (Of course, that's damning with faint praise considering the lowly state of most sci-fi these days.) Despite a few shortcomings, most aspects of Oblivion are a cut above the standard. First, the storyline is genuinely intriguing, even if it ultimately fails to generate that ineffable sense of wonder that the best sci-fi is capable of. (I give it points for an earnest attempt, though.) Second, the movie is visually stunning, especially during the first half. Sunsets bathe the characters in a moody radiance; the vistas of a ravaged Earth are close to breathtaking; camera angles immerse the viewer in the action in inventive ways; and the tech is both totally believable and pretty darn cool. Third, the film displays an intelligence that is increasingly rare in Hollywood and therefore most welcome. The only real downside is the reliance (as is so common these days) on a multitude of action set-pieces, one after the other. However, the pacing leaves sufficient room to breathe between each fight/chase sequence that the viewer doesn't feel overwhelmed. My biggest gripe about the movie (and it's an admittedly small one) is the payoff line Tom Cruise's character utters at the climax. He literally just finishes quoting Tacitus or some similar Roman poet-historian, only to follow that with the most cringe-inducing of vulgar epithets. If that's the filmmakers' idea of an inspirational sound bite, then they sorely miscalculated. Aside from that misstep, though, Oblivion gets most things right and proves to be a wholly enjoyable entertainment that respects the audience's intelligence. Recommended.
B00514HDNW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It's a new take on an old classic, way better than the movie. I recommend it.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|This time I didn't win in the Kindle singles crap shoot. Tried on two different times to get into this story and finally just deleted it.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|another great book by lee child about jack reacher; he is one of the best authors of thiller fiction & i enjoy the detail he goes into in his books whether it is describing events or developing characters; i intend to download more child books, i have read seven full books & two short stories by him; the short stories i can do withoug but his other books are great & i highly recomend them
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|Not sure how this could have been worse. We didn't bother finishing the movie and were actually irritated that we wasted 30 minutes on it.
B0058W74UY|5.0|i have not used it much  but will love to use it soon,  i have lots of things to open
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This app works well for pretty much anyone.  It is easy to use and functions well for most any circumstance. I am glad I got it!

B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This game is very addictive. It is similar to Farmville. I originally downloaded this app for my todler, but it's me who is always playing it. It is pretty difficult, and I think it would be best for ages 12 and up.
B0063M22QO|5.0|love this game, it is mindboggling and so addictive.  i can't wait to play everyday. so much fun.  i love it
B001G93Z60|5.0|I like that Anastacia has such talent that she 's still going strong on this CD. i enjoy artists like her who continue to bring it in their music, and still be individuals in their singing styles. Would reccomend this album for anyone who is looking for an artist with good talent and individualism.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|i love this, i keep up with my family and friends that i don;t get to see everyday and i love the pics

B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This game was very fun to play. I would recommend it to anyone who plays these type of games. I love the graphics and storytelling.
B00785P2QC|3.0|This is an okay game. But you have to leave a review in order to complete one of the tasks. So here I am. Laugh out loud addicting. The crappy part is that there is a word minimum.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Me and my brother plays minecraft pe multiplayer all the time and they're realms and the new update 0.7.3 AWESOME GET THIS GAME
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Really enjoyed this book. It was well written and not too predicable. Page turner but beautifully written. Great pace all around solid.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|i couldn't wait to show my family the original trilogy in blu-ray brilliance! This was a must for my personal collection! So sit back, grab snacks and turn the lights down, volume up and enjoy!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Watched season 1 and 2.  Will wait till the next season is available at Amazon Prime.  Loved it. and will continue watching.
B0000AM6IY|5.0|I insisted that my family watch this beautiful, rich urban adaptation of Shakespeare's classic &#34;Romeo and Juliet&#34;. I just love the energy, dancing and the awesome music- had to add this to the family collection!
B0049J0DC8|5.0|Good movie, although after watching it again with our 2 year old, it does seem a little violent at times...
B004J88SGC|4.0|I wish i could have been there live- but this is the best i could do. there are so many more of his hits i wish he had done but i'm not mad at Billy.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is asom i love it is so cool my mom has it on her phon she can not stop plaing it
B00004XMTJ|4.0|i would have loved to see this live. As a cat owner, i wanted to show my family the classic Broadway play! The great dancing, music and story make this a timeless classic!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is by far one of my favorites. Of course it has a love triangle but it's not the focus of the book. There are soo many great themes and ideas. And a plus is that the movie follows the book pretty well!
B000PMG16U|5.0|I had to introduce my family to this great, epic story! I wanted the blu-ray for the best presentation available!
B00571F26Y|3.0|The good:<br />1) Most folks I've spoken with seem to ignore the differences between how your body metabolizes certain foods (e.g., carbs vs. nuts) and the addictive nature of certain foods (i.e. wheat, among others).  It's not just about calorie counts, and its wrong to just say &#34;eat less&#34;.  It matters what you eat, which is one of the big messages of the book.  I would normally sit down to dinner at a nice restaurant and eat 3-4 pieces of delicious bread.  No more!<br />2) This is the first book I've read that convinced me that carbs are the issue for weight gain.  Other have said this, but this is the one that broke through for me, and I've lost about 3 lbs in the past month since I started down this path.  It's clearly written and worth reading, even if you're not fully convinced.<br /><br />The bad<br />1) You don't have to cut out all wheat and be crazy about it to see big benefits (unless you are celiac or really wheat intolerant).  He seems to gloss over this.  Just cut out bread most of the time and you're on the way.<br />2) It's really carbs that cause me to gain weight, not just wheat, so his argument is really a &#34;bait and switch&#34;, as other commenters have noted.  Wheat isn't the real enemy unless you are among those who are really allergic or have celiac.<br />3) He seems to be hawking different products and making a lot of money at it, which makes me skeptical of his motives.<br />4) While I was convinced of the possibility of recent (past 50 years) changes in the wheat genome being less good for people, I don't think he make a conclusive case for this.  It could be true, but it's not clear.<br /><br />So overall, it's worth a read, but with a skeptical eye.
B005EHQGTS|4.0|This App runs clean & trouble free. Nice & simple interface. Easy to use. Smooth. Love, love to love you.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|One of the most fun and interesting shows ever.  DVD is great.  Perfect cast and Joss Whedon's concept is excellent.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I was hoping for a game more like the &quot;Oregon Trail&quot; of the 1980`s, but this is reminiscent of &quot;Frontierville&quot; on Facebook.  Energy is lost quickly but seems to replenish fast.  Nothing is really customisable, and if it is, it's not cheap.  I would like something more like &quot;Sims Freeplay&quot; with the same storyline.  Overall it's worth trying for free, even if it's just to cure boredom or pass the time.
B00ECUARO8|1.0|Mud is a Dud. I regret renting this from a RedBox and wasting $1.50. This is more Hollywood waste matter that depends on a popular actor to draw enough audience to turn a profit.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This is by far the best version I've seen of this story. Anne Hathaway deserved her award for her singing! Hugh was brilliant and try as i might to resist, I was brought to tears. Beautiful, just beautiful.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I've seen lots of reviews complaining about what the Chromecast doesn't do, these seem to be from people who didn't do much research on it before they got it.  Seemed pretty clear to me that it was simply an easy method for streaming Netflix and YouTube to your TV - and for $35, that ain't bad.  But with that said I am hoping other applications are soon added that will work with it (and it was that in mind that I went ahead and purchased it).  Specifically Picasa.  This seems like a no brainer, especially since Google owns Picasa.  It would be great to be able to do slideshows using your phone or tablet. Any \\"mirroring\\" of ANY other apps would be great as well.  In the meantime I'm happy to use it to watch Netflix and YouTube.<br /><br />The good:<br />Portability (great for trips)<br />Ease of use<br /><br />The bad:<br />Get's really hot<br />Unless you have a powered USB connection it's kind of a pain to run a power cord to it (fortunately my home theater receiver made this easy)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It trains it mind to be active by using the skill of observance as a tool to graduate from one level to another.
B00797MB0O|4.0|it starts slow but the conclusion is meaningful likes it very much.  at first I was upset because the guy was married, in a sense I think that the wife might had been a nice person but then again its a movie.  I would not try to help my husband's Ex.
B00A77II0U|2.0|Crashed a lot on my fire, had to restart kindle. Not a hard game. A little too wierd/cheesy for me, was glad when I finished it and quickly uninstalled it. I wouldn't recommend it to my friends.
B009D7CP2M|5.0|Very well written.  Tough subject, great book!  We read this for our book club and had a very lively discussion.
B004VQRCF0|5.0|Not the sellers fault, hopefully, but the DVD was loose in it's case when it arrived. The DVD has scratches on it because of this. I played a few minutes of it & it doesn't seem to be compromised but I haven't had the time to view it in its entirety.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this simple and honest story of a young woman's life and NDE.  I thought her account was articulate and truthful.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is an awesome game to have. Thoroughly addicting, &amp; a &quot;can't put down&quot; type of game. My kids love to play with their kindle time as well as myself when I need &quot;me/down&quot; time. Can't wait to see the 2nd movie :)
B00APKIN1I|4.0|I can't speak to the complaints about dynamic range compression on the CD version of Sound City, but it isn't overdone on the mp3 version.<br />Lots of peaks & valleys here, along with some great tunes!
B003TSEL7S|2.0|this was a ok book. it was basically percy Jackson all  over  again. it was same old same old Percy Jackson i like the secons one way more than  the  first
B0009P42UK|3.0|I ordered this for our son to watch on his PSP during long trips or what have you. My wife & I both grew up seeing this in the theater and still love it to this day. A Jim Henson masterpiece to say the least and I was tickled pink to find it on UMD. However when I purchased this it was listed as &#34;New&#34; and while it was packaged well in the box, the movie itself is not new in any sense of the word. The exterior case is yellowed from age and the clips to hold it closed are broken. Likewise the UMD itself has scratches on both the outer case and on the disc itself. However, even for a used game listed as new the price was reasonable.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is a great game. Very addictive!! Love it!! My husband downloaded it on his iPod too. Highly recommend it.
0670014893|4.0|Another excellently written book. One of those you start reading and suddenly realize you are 50 pages on. The story line, once you analyze it afterwards is very weak and it is yet another of his books those books with no ending which leaves you hanging and disappointed. I will forebear going into detail for the sake of those who have not read it yet At least with his Cold War spy stories there was a definitive end and explanation, almost all of his later books have been spoiled for me by this lack of finality. Will probably buy the next one anyway because they are such a good and easy read.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I liked the movies but the books are so much better! Suzanne Collins is a genius! I know other &#34;book junkies&#34; wish the movies could be 4 hours and have every detail from the book but this book deserves it!
B00CSCJ09K|5.0|David is an excellent violinist and plays as levels of music.  He is a great entertainer as well.  He will go from classical to popular and without hesitation.  I truly love the way he plays and you can tell by his enthusiasm when you see he play.
B00BBI9WD6|4.0|The story continues to be interesting with the action parts continue to be well done.  Characters are good and well written.
B008JFUO72|2.0|movie was ok. probably should of waited to watch it on pay per view.<br /><br /> director Shane Black is an idiot and ruined the trilogy. (one of the most exciting Marvel characters ever created)<br /><br />the movie has plenty of action but will disappoint and leave you wanting more.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|it needs more play points I hate having to wait a hour to play a game please fix this thank you
B004Q0R7FG|5.0|My 18 month old loves Chuggington so this was a great addition to our collection for his train table. Lots of fun!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|fun and interesting game,  its like a treasure hunt and escape game on in one! I really enjoy playing this game.
B00005MKA1|5.0|me and my father love this album. i enjoy listen to it. this one is for any fan of bob Marley.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|One of my favorite shows.  Great dialogue and drama.  Louis Litt is one of the best secondary characters of all time.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|An awesome book. Relevant and applicable at every turn! Gary Chapman chose to speak truth through all the pages, something I appreciated so much. Grab a copy it's worth the read!!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|After reading The Kite Runner, I was nervous to read his second book (One Thousand Splendid Suns) because I thought it couldn't possibly be as wonderful.  And yet it was.  When I heard his third book came out, I thought there was no chance it would hold up.  It's another beautiful, thoughtful journey through times and places I could imagine because of his writing.  I was engaged and cared about every character, which is quite a feat.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This dongle plugs into my HDMI port and is powered by an on board USB port I have on my TV. Setup was simple: Downloaded the chromecast app to my phone, connected it with the ChromeCast, and input my information. Setup time was only 2 minutes total. After that, I was able to stream Google Music, Movies, Netflix and Youtube all to my TV. For $35, you really can't go wrong with this.<br /><br />The selection of apps that work with it is quite limited for the time being, but developers are already doing great things with it so the app base should expand in no time. (For those with rooted phones, CyanogenMod ROMS already allow you to stream local content from your phone and ChromeCast your photos and videos.)
B000I0XLYO|5.0|What a classic and Amazon makes it so easy to purchase.  I will use this service again to get more movies.
B00005JKCH|5.0|this is a great one to get if you like the comic book of spider man. this is for any fan of spider man.

B006PE6VW6|5.0|Not your typical chick flick, my husband liked it too. I have watched it several times and would recommend it to my friends
1451695187|5.0|With losing a father and a father-in-law months apart in 2012, and witnessing their behaviors and conversations that didn't make sense at the time, I now have a better understanding what they were going through.  This doctor's experience makes all the sense in this incredible life that we have and gives me a great sense of peace for the next life that awaits us all. Incredible book and incredible experience.  Glad Dr. Alexander lived to enlighten all of us. God Bless you!  J. Finn, Kenoza Lake, NY
B003YNFYCO|5.0|I enjoyed all there albums and there b sides. this one is a great one to get if you like there hits from 1962-1966.

B00992CF6W|5.0|think. you notch for macking this game I love you minecraft and you to notch its my help to help you
B00BEZTMQ8|3.0|Movie could have been better if it didn't have so much &#34;filler&#34; to make it longer.  Unlike the first three, which I have watched at least three times, once here may be enough, unless as a refresher for the next movie.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This book was less than captivating and I could and did put it down easier than the first two books.  It had just the opposite effect of book one as the violence was not as essential to the extreme it was taken.  Some of which added nothing to the story line.  I'm glad I read it to finish th series but thankful there isn't a fourth.
B00AEFY0F2|5.0|I heard from friends that this movie was great and it won 6 academy awards in 1994. this one is for any tom hanks fan.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|actually some of the games u need some quick reflexes.. also its a lot of points to open other games
B003TOMAPC|5.0|Love it! Great movie. Looking forward to seeing the newest movie. Rented this one because I hadn't seen it, after all these years. Glad I rented it. I want to watch it again!
B004AFFZNI|5.0|It's a GoPro Skeleton case. Does what it's suppose to do, nothing more, nothing less. I use mine everyday as a dash cam. Can catch some wild things while driving around with the camera recording.
B0088P2A7A|5.0|I thought it could use a few improvements like on Kiele fire because it is laggy sometimes but overall a great app
B00CWY76CC|5.0|really:-)  like this game, good way of keeping the brain going. I am looking forward to more levels. Well done.
B000B8QG22|5.0|I enjoy his movies. this one is a good one to get if you like war movies and robin Williams.
0307476073|3.0|As someone who turns to nature when trying to work out my issues and having recently lost my mother, I figured this book would be perfect for me. And it was fine. It wasn't awful, by any means, but certainly not the amazing, heartbreakingly beautiful and inspiring story everybody claims it is. The story, if you can believe the author, and I'm not 100% sure I do, is interesting enough. Something was just missing for me. I had difficulty feeling sorry for Cheryl's troubles along the way because she made the choice to hike the trail in the first place. We get it. Your feet hurt. You're hiking through two states. What did you think would happen? I think your enjoyment of this book comes down to whether or not you like the author. As the book nears its conclusion, we're meant to believe the author has struggled with her fears and pain and changed into a better, wiser, stronger version of herself. That reads well, but it didn't ring true for me. Life isn't that tidy. You don't go from promiscuous to restrained just because you lose a few toenails and go thirsty for a summer. To me, it seems like the author had an adventure in her youth and decided, in hindsight, to put extra meaning and value on it. I can't argue with the results. She's done quite well for herself. But there's something inauthentic about it that irks me.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I found that this book was a great adult read.  I have enjoyed and have already moved on to book 2 in the series.
B003O86FMW|5.0|After reading the first book I was ready for the second and it's a amazing story... with the movie coming on november you should read the book.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Well it's a great game and all,but,I wish it could be easier. But that doesn't mean it isn't fun. It's a great game for my little pony lovers like me. I'll give it a five star rating though (:
1451695195|4.0|This is a very interesting perspective.  This is a real challenge for non-believers in the medical field.  It is a worthwhile read.
B005EVVPUE|5.0|I enjoy the 2003 live at Wembley stadium concert and i was glad to get the remastered one. this is for any queen fan.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|From beginning to end this Thailand based movie about the Sunami hit there and how it effected this family of five on their Christmas vacattion there. Highly recommended for it's real drama and heroism this family displayed in a most tragic time.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|ONLY WEAK POINT.  I THINK YOU COULD HAVE FOUND A BETTER WATSON. I HOPE MANY MORE OF THIS SERIES WILL SHOW UP SOON ON NETFLIX
B004U8VWLE|1.0|What a load of hype this got. That's why I rented it. I couldn't get half way through. It was so immature and just ridiculously stupid. I thought it was going to be some kind of dramatic thriller like single white female or something. It wasn't. It hinted at trying to be a coming of age or finding yourself (pardon the pun) or stage mother type movie, but failed.  Every time you thought something intriguing was going to happen, it didn't. It missed the mark and too many levels to list here. I would recommend you skip this one.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|In this age of so many talentless music \\"stars\\" who take all their money and adulation for granted, it's fantastic to see the opposite.  This Mexican-American guitarist made two great albums in the early 1970's and went on to do dirty and back breaking renovations of modest Detroit houses for 25 years.  What happens next is almost like a fairy tale.  It's so rare to watch a documentary with a true happy ending.
B00EEXST2K|4.0|I have never seen the film for which Ms. Marchiano rose to fame, but I love a good biography. Everyone has a story, and hers is compelling. The filmmakers get the feel of the era spot-on, and there is not a lackluster performance to be found. Ms. Seyfried is bound to garner an award nomination, which would be well-dserved. Sharon Stone is also fabulous as Linda's mother.<br /><br />This film is as tastefully shot as a film including pornography could be. The scenes of violence and exploitation are difficult to stomach. They should be. This is both the story of one woman's struggle with sexual abuse, as well as a cautionary tale.<br />At its core, the film highlights Marchiano's positive message that a person should not be defined by their mistakes, and that a &#34;regular life&#34; can be more fulfilling than fame.
B000LC4ZF8|5.0|I enjoy his movie like dragnet and toy story 1-3 and forest Gump. this one is a funny movie to get if you like tom hanks.
B0067R0APK|1.0|All I want/need is a simple way to find what the weather is/will be, not this monstrosity! It is far too complicated. FIRE THE GENIUS THAT CAME UP WITH THIS APP!
B0025UHKNS|2.0|I wish I had returned it the first time it froze up on me.  I thought I had resolved the problem and now 2 years later it is not functional at all.  When it worked it was great when it did not it was frustrating especially when on super long runs.  Now it is just a waste of money.
B00CATSONE|2.0|As I sit here wirelessly reading print transmitted over great distances, I am in awe of Tesla's visions.  That circumstance has, however, unfortunately enabled widely distributed works of lower quality to be \\"published\\".  This one has the feel and depth of a half-inch deep AP history essay or Wiki article that would fail for lack of substantiation.  I'm thankful it was free, and it does not inspire me to buy the self-help book that it is advertising.
B00DM0XXCM|1.0|Films like \\"Book of Eli\\" and \\"The Road\\" have suffered from ugly, limited color palettes but never this bad.  In addition to the incessant grays and blues, everything has a metallic haze, and the glaring whites will hurt your eyes no matter how brightly lit your room is.  I also suspect they couldn't afford the best digital cameras for some scenes because the movements are clunky and blurred.  Your eyes will beg you for a good old 35mm or 70mm film.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The Fault in our Stars is an amazing Book. Its about 2 teens, Hazel and Augustus. Hazel had cancer and her mother Forces her to go to This \\"support group\\" to help her, She then meets Augustus. She becomes friends With him, it turns into this Spiral of them starting to love Each other. I don't to Give away the Ending, you will just Have to read It. If you liked this Book you need to read all of John's Other books. Its a must read for all Nerdfighters. (We are like Normal people but made Of pure Awesome) DFTBA
B00005JPFH|5.0|i enjoyed all the spider man movies and this one was a great one to get if you like the 3rd spider man.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is so good.  I don't know how I am going to wait until the new season comes out.  This mini-series is truly addictive.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Every time I use this app it freezes my Kindle do not get!!!!! I could never turn it off or get back to my home page! Worst app ever!!!!! :( :(
B009LK6JS2|5.0|I love this game it is very much worth the three dollars I recommend you get it this game is sooooo amazing
B005G5PPGS|5.0|So many great life lessons in this film. It was really well done and although not an entirely accurate depiction of reality (you should read the book too), it was a wonderful film and I would highly recommend it. It's one of those movies you can watch over and over again.
B008JFUN6E|3.0|Matt Damon is now jumping into the realm of superhero blockbuster mode.  Yes...I'm aware he portrayed Jason Bourne, but that's on a different level in comparison.  Nevertheless, Elysium had that same District 9 worldy atmospheric feel, a feel the Director invites everyone to revisit.  The movie dives right into the story showcasing this futuristic present day world we live in, and it's not pretty.  Los Angeles is the futuristic city, and it's filled with poverty, war, crime, pollution, disease, and overpopulation.  Robots similar to the District 9 prototypes police and monitor the inhabitants of Los Angeles and beyond.<br /><br /> Meanwhile, Elysium is situated and isolated outside Planet Earth but visually seen with the naked eye from Earth as if you're peering up at the Moon.  What is it?  Elysium is an isolated futuristic crafted bio-dome designed for the elitist individuals of society that want nothing to do with the state of affairs happening on Plant Earth.  To fast forward in my review - It held my attention - the casting was sound - Sharlto Copley was on the docket as he was the lead in District 9.  The story had some over-the-top scenes - it dragged a bit toward the end with the endless fight scenes and cat and mouse shenanigans.  The movie ended in a \\"positive\\" direction, but it had major realistic flaws ending in the direction it did.<br /><br />*SPOILER*<br /><br />Even if all citizens on Planet Earth now had access to Elysium, and it's healing capabilities...... that doesn't necessarily make the world a better place.  The Planet was overpopulated to begin with, therefore nothing resolves this overpopulation crisis if you start healing everyone of ailments.....Secondly, this movie had subtleties shining a light on Mexicans overpopulating and destroying Los Angeles - I do hope that was NOT the Director's intent, and if it was he has a backwards and flawed view of the future of our Planet.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|I enjoy the pixar movie that they came out with and this one is a great one to get if you like those movie.
B00CS65QGW|5.0|Great, fun song. Wish I knew what Daft Punk looked like though. I don't know why I have to write a certain amount of words for these reviews...
B0058YPG1G|5.0|One of the BEST shows ever written and the acting is second to NONE, you will enjoy every episode. All hail the king!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|A sequel that tops the last book in more ways than one. This book has been gripping since the Capitol has struck down harder on the civilians who have seen Katniss as an inspiration. And seeing that she now has to battle the other victors. But the big reveal at the end really shocked me to the point that I can't wait to read the final book.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|this is a great game for people who like my little pony is a little kid.I like this game because it is a easy fun game!:)
0307477479|4.0|Being an older person, I felt like I was not up with the times of this book.  Well written, but was strange to me.
B00005JPS8|5.0|I enjoyed his movies. this one is a great one to get if you like the first one where he becomes iron man.
159463176X|1.0|I read both the Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns, loved them both and was looking forward to reading this one.  Unfortunately for Khaled Husseini, it'll be hard to please his fans after 2 great books.  And unfortunately for the fans, this book doesn't measure up.  Too many stories weaved into one... I cared about Abdallah and his sister Pari and wanted to find out how their lives evolved.  Instead, we read about the lives of all the other characters and how their lives evolved.  The book is not focused and goes in too many directions.<br />If this is the first book you read for Mr. Husseini, you might enjoy it.<br />I'm sorry to say, it's a book I don't recommend...
B008P9M614|5.0|One of the BEST shows ever written and the acting is second to NONE, you will enjoy every episode. Don't be an idiot and not have these for your collection!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I will admit that I saw the movie first but my friend says that I should read the book as well. This book was more brutal but really great. I will continue reading the rest of the books before the next films come out so I can go in knowing what others won't. Lol
B009NY43NY|3.0|Th  entire series was just 'ok' to me.. Now I absolutely love the Tv series but the books were just a way to get more True Blood. I liked them bu  i wouldn't reread them.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|There was some predictable parts but still a read. The ending was good but wish there was a little more closure with some of the characters.
B00008GKEG|5.0|Superb!  The video footage alone is priceless, providing a necessary context to really &#34;hear&#34; the songs.  The series portrayed the fundamental component of the Beatles success --perseverance!
B00866JL96|5.0|Zac Efron impresses once again. First it was in [[ASIN:B003L20IHE Charlie St. Cloud]] and now this to an even greater extent. The film was all-around great. The actors all did a pretty good job. But I was extremely impressed with Zac's character as the detached war survivor. This is the first role that I've seen him play someone sooo serious!!! He didn't smile that much in the movie and for some reason I don't think that reflects who Zac is as a person at all. He really did play the hell out of this part!<br /><br />The movie itself was made up of a lot of romance, some drama and a few pinches of life lessons all mixed in one. I really enjoyed the scenery, the characters and the roles they played and much of the music. It all tied together quite well. I especially loved the fact that Zac's character wound up at a place that takes care of and trains dogs. That was really special to me as they are my favorite pet ever!<br /><br />I know I haven't said all that much about the movie specifically (I really don't like those reviews that spoil the whole thing for you!) but like I've said before I'm like 5x better at writing reviews for music.<br /><br />Overall, this is probably the best movie I've seen all year! So definitely take into consideration that this review in no way, shape or form does this beautiful movie justice. After watching it I think this movie is rated PG-13; there is some swearing and very minor nudity (Zac's butt is shown in the nude for like 3 seconds) but other than that it's a pretty clean movie. Along with [[ASIN:B003NHRIVQ The Last Song]] I have to pick this movie up. DEFINITELY worth your time!<br /><br />4.5 stars.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|One of the BEST shows ever written and the acting is second to NONE, you will enjoy every episode. All hail the king!!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I never really read a book that almost brought me to tears other than this book. I really enjoyed it. I loved the characters and seeing their struggle and the romance that blossoms between them. The last days of Augustus makes your heart sink. The pre funeral and the last letter of Augustus was the best and most beautiful parts.
B001QB5S3G|5.0|Inspiring, beautiful movie with great actors and a wonderful message about faith. Definitely recommend it to anyone; it's important to understand the struggles faced in the pursuit of religion!
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Looking for new game and thought I'd try this one.Similar to other matching games but fun! Waiting for update on Fruit Quest
B004KPQK2S|4.0|Secretariat is about possibilities, and the will to never give up.<br />It covers the depth of love in families, the power to overcome, the will to win.<br />True Friendship, determination. The sweetness of victory!<br />Oh, yes and the filming is high quality, of coming from disney....right.<br /><br />i must see!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I know that body counts are not popular, but I believe that it is essential for the American people to know that our fighters extracted their pounds of flesh from these animals they fought against!  ROES have caused so many of our fighters to lose their lives....when will we ever learn!
B001DJLCRC|5.0|One of the BEST shows ever written and the acting is second to NONE, you will enjoy every episode. All hail the king!!!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|You can spend hours playing this game. Lots of fun but you may tire of it somewhat quickly. The price was right. LOL
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I highly recommend this book to anyone with an open mind and a willingness to create the life of their desires.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great way to finish -loved the entire series- hate for it to be over<br />They became a very real part of my world- I'll miss them
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|This is my very favorite Jane Austen book.  I know most people like Pride and Prejudice best, but read this one as well.
B00E25KVLW|4.0|I liked the chapters on caching and i18n, it´s interesting find material written overseas about rails. higlhy recommended. truthfully. excellent.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so fun!!!! We played it a lot! Then it would'nt let us on,  so we deleted it.
B00ECU2RGY|1.0|I would like to start by saying I love science fiction.  I was raised in the heady days of Apollo and my literary tastes eventually included the entire pantheon of speculative fiction from Asimov to Zelazny.  I saw Star Wars 16 times in the theater after I got out of boot camp.  I was never a Trekker, but I watched the first series and Next Generation.  I even liked Wall-E.  The first time, that is, not this version.  This is a pastiche of plots from a wide swath of SciFi, and not a tasty one.  Cruise is and will always be a bad actor.  Good directors shoot his emotional scenes using shots of his back because his face never matches his vocal delivery or body language.  He may have embraced his faith as a way of explaining the weird somatic separation in his acting.  In this dog he is on-screen nearly the entire time, trying to be dramatic and achieving elevated levels of boredom.  If you like predictable garbage, this turds for you.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Very good production values, good cast, solid acting.<br />The camera work was just beautiful.<br />I thought the story was well done.  Liked the little twist that comes.<br />I enjoyed this very much and thought it romantic as well.<br />Too bad it was panned so badly before it even got into the theaters.<br />Tom Cruise appeared to be into this character much more so than<br />some of his roles.  There was no sarcasm here or tongue in cheek attitude.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|This is so much fun and it's free! I love the cartoon gopher and the little movie story that goes along with the game. Great graphics! Simply put, the best solitaire game.
0061537969|5.0|Recommend this to anyone for the insight it gives on a dog, his owner, and many of life's lessons.  Great read.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|This is perfect for just protecting your phone and cheap comared to competition. It is pretty cool looking too if you have a white Iphone.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app really helped me find my path back to God!  I now read the Bible daily, and have already read through it once - working on the second time.  It really helps you plan your reading.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|I have always enjoyed watching The Goonies and Instant viewing on my Panasonic Tv was great.Being able to view streaming movies is fantastic Amazons selection is great.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I like these types of games and this one is well executed. good graphics and not too terribly hard to figure out where to press.
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|If you had told me 10 years ago I'd be engrossed in books about Afghanistan I probably would have laughed in your face.  But Khalid Hosseini manages to sweep me into a world that I find compelling and irresistible.  I found the Kite Runner so powerful, A Thousand Splendid Suns heartrending and here with And The Mountains Echoed beautifully drawn characters that simply touch the heartstrings because they are so real.  I enter a world that is entirely alien to me and yet find the struggles of his characters with problems such as poverty, jealousy, sacrifice and Alzheimers totally believable and gripping.  Another fascinating bite of a culture I do not share nor understand but find so intriguing to read about.
B00B2YH7D6|5.0|Absolutely fantastic. Dave Grohl tells a fantastic story about an amazing and unassuming place. Hard to put into words just how great this documentary is. It's about music and people and passion.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Game of thrones is very addicting. If you are going to buy one episode, just buy the whole season because you wont be able to stop watching!
B00CWY76CC|1.0|No real instructions for use.  If an intelligent person like me cannot figure it out in a few minutes, it needs instructions. There weren ' t any, so I deleted the app.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Have just gotten to the part where Nick is searching frantically for Amy.<br />She has suddenly disappeared withou<br />A trace Where could she be???
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I didn't care for Katniss' character by the end.  She was too whiny.  Plus, this book got pretty gruesome.  It was too depressing.
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|I like this game.  It tests your speed of response as well as memory.  How close do you pay attention to things you see.  Good exercise.
B00CDCLL1A|5.0|This is a movie that is both fun and will speak to you in its own voice, and in many voices, and on many levels.  I was somewhat prepared for it from reading a few of that reviews that cautioned (welcomed or criticized) its unconventional structure.  The polarization of the professional reviews it received was telling.  As many who liked it have said, it is a film that will be worth watching again.  The performances of everyone involved with this move - from directing, to acting, to editing, to production design, to special effects, to music are all amazing.  Forget what you know about watching or telling a conventional story - and enjoy the way that multiple stories are told, intertwined, and contrasted here.  If a simple story is linear and one dimensional, and a movie with flash backs or ensemble stories is two dimensional, then this film is truly multi dimensional, with links along, between, and across the stories that are told.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Today was my first time,it's a really fun game so far. I totally recommend it. You clean your horse. You can compete. You can also feed you horse
B003U6BE8I|4.0|cute fun family movie. A little like many other fantasy movies but still fun to watch. needed to see before I saw the new one. Glad I did
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Had so much fun with this... great game to teach teamwork to my daughter. We worked together for hours with lots of laughs!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Excellent and perfect, and does everything I want it to do, easy to use and is actually a great way to add things up quickly and efficiently
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|I won't lie and say that the storyline is the greatest but I think that this movie has one of the best chase scene I have seen in a long time.<br /><br />I put the chase scene up there with Vanishing Point, The Seven Ups and To Live and Die in L.A. and Death Proof.  I know that there are many more that compare and are better but this my personal opinion.
B00992CF6W|4.0|if it was more like the Xbox version  with monster spawn and mine cars my review would be 5 stars and there would be even players playing it
B001O1O71C|3.0|The little boy is so endearing and lovable and naive.  This book will hurt your heart and make you want to hug the children close to you. Well written!
B00821OX98|5.0|The quality of video is great and so is the series.  I am happy to have amazon video because of this.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|Reading in bed is now a relaxing experience.  The case keeps my Kindle balanced, steady and at a perfect reading angle... This has been the perfect case and the sale price was also a bonus!
B009XIXVU6|3.0|The story was fine, but the setting/flashback technique was to the point of confusion and annoyance.  I was left wanting to continue one story line and forced into another.  Others may have found this a captivating approach...I found it frustrating.  Too bad, because I enjoyed the plot and the characters.  I will say that the writing was of fine quality.  I find so few books these days written with skill and literary value, that when I find this quality in a book, I say it is worth reading.
0345529057|3.0|There are some engaging moments and some interesting ideas floating around in these books but I often lose them in the midst of just okay writing and a sometimes erratic flow. When I finished the 1st book I had to convince myself to get going with the 2nd. But I'm told the 3rd is the best so we'll see.
B00280LYIC|3.0|So correct me if I am wrong but this seems like  a completely different book than the first time I read it when it first came out.  Definitely not happy with the changes.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My husband and I were so hooked on season 1 and 2 that we couldn't wait 2 weeks until season 3 came out so we had to buy it on Amazon.  We are NOT disappointed that we did.  This season takes TWD to a whole new level!  Thrills upon thrills!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I love it! It explaned everything so clearly. I understand on such a deeper level now. Reccomend this book to anyone looking to deepen their knowledge on how the universe works.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|All I can really say about this first person shooter game is<br />It's amazing, multiplayer, and who doesn't love first person.
B0090KZDSK|3.0|Had read Silvia Day's first two books of Sylvia Day's so had to complete the triology!<br />Not a bad read.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|At first I was worried this story was simply a rehash of stories Gaiman has told us before - in the villain there's a hint of the cukoo from Sandman or the other-mother from Coraline, but this story is fresh, engaging and personal enough to shine with it's own light.  If you've ever liked anything by Gaiman, you'll love this one.
B007PVHBHC|5.0|Although I heard Patti Smith's music growing up, I had never purchased any of her works previously.  The first CD set I purchased was Land, then read Just Kids.  Since then I've purchased some of her other works including Banga.  Love it.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|Buggy Interface with other players. You can not win this game unless you spend lots of money or at least a year. Gets boring and repetitive after two weeks.  Great graphics.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I lost my charger for my Kindle Fire.  Bought this to replace it, works great.  My husband even borrows it for his Blackberry.
0064400557|5.0|If you have never read this book do good forever wish I could of gotten hardback. After you read this book call your local gov and see what they say about pulling it
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I like it makes you think and look but not to hard! I have really enjoyed this game a lot!
B00632HWOG|5.0|This is very easy to get to I do hope there are on plans to change this one,about the time I get to know just how to get where I want without any  problem the program gets changed.  That's what I do not like.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|keeps you interested for hours an easy to learn but hard to master game would tell anyone to try it
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A beautiful and sad story woven through the eyes of many characters, it was hard to put down and now I'm sad it's over.
1936608898|5.0|I love this book and the recipes are very tasty. Although it is hard to get started once you commit, it is easy to follow.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Once again Nicholas Sparks brings tears to my eyes. There isn't a book of his that I've read without needing a box of tissues. A great, page turner that kept me wanting more.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is simply the best horse game ive ever played. I recommend it for all. :) &amp; a great way to pass time!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great read. It is similar to the first book just as others say but has an excitement to it as well. Really recommend this book.
0345803450|4.0|My introduction to Ian McEwan's writing was ATONEMENT -- and I've been waiting for something as full of the unexpected since from Mr. McEwan.  SWEET TOOTH carries more bite than the title might initially indicate (it did for me).  It is much less about sweet than it is about fascinating characters that sometimes maddened me but always kept me reading.  Perhaps most importantly, it is also about twists and turns that do not receive full explanations until the very last pages of the book, a litany of history and historical figures upon which both the storyline and setting sometime hang (Ian Fleming, for example, plays a brief but intriguingly real role near the end of the book), and the rendering of espionage and spy games in ways they are rarely portrayed in fiction.  Some reviewers have said the ending is trite.  I disagree.  It actually made me laugh with pleasure, because it caught me off guard so effectively.  I like being caught off guard by an author, and as in ATONEMENT, the end of SWEET TOOTH has also caught me off guard.  So even if you think the plot is a bit thin or plodding at times (there were moments I did -- hence the 4 stars rather than 5), you will not be disappointed if you read all the way to the last sentence.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like this game. It`s simple &amp; fun. I would like more variety to the mini-games, especially when visiting a friend`s stable, though.
B005LAII3U|4.0|This actually was a worthy remake. It had it similarities but was different.<br /><br />Colin Farrell was great as the lead, and special effects were very good.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like how you interact with thw horse. I love horses and this game is so fun.<br />so far no conplains for this app
B0064X7FVE|2.0|The current temperature &amp; that's about it.<br />There could be a lot of improvements.  No frills is putting it mildly.
B007Q0OUNA|5.0|The toy my son expected, the price is worthed...  every action figure look so real, my son loves it and plays a lot
B00AEBB8XS|5.0|As a &#34;Warriors&#34; fan, I was delighted to find this in Blu-ray, since my old DVD copy disappeared from my collection. The price was awesome, has great quality and it has some extras given the fact that this is an Ultimate Director's cut. If you love this movie as much as I do then you should buy it.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Run and jump and grab coins, oops, I mean bananas. Nothing new here. Graphics are nice but that's not enough to hold my interest? Deleted.
B008JEJVXG|5.0|Wild Nothing is one of my top 3 favorite contemporary bands and Nocturne is one of the best albums I have listened to in the last 5 years. I'm a big The Cure fan (actually the band I keep closest to my heart) and Nocturne gave me almost the same buzz I had when I listened to Disintegration, back in 1989. A fantastic mix of introspection, spacey guitars and catchy melodies.
B000FCKIFU|4.0|I like David Baldacci but hadn't read any about The Camel Club.  I liked it and will definitely read more Camel Club stories.
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|I love this book the only thing I did not like was the way they talk it is a little weird for our time period but the over all story was vary good I like this book a lot
B00CA6WLAE|5.0|Can't wait for the next book.... this is why I love reading!!!! Chris is a wonderful author and actor. Thank you.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|This is a great movie and I hate that I missed it in the movies.The children and I loved it, It is a great family movie!

0763655465|5.0|A magic combination of a simple and funny story with graphically beautiful illustrations. I'm a children's books illustrations and got really impressed by Chris' style. Hats off, Mr. Haughton.

B000KI10VU|5.0|I was so happy to have found an original copy of this very wonderful classic.  It was one of several required summer reading books for my niece who is 11yrs old.  I wanted her to read the original and true version and felt lucky to have found this copy, which I mailed to her.
B0061PEAUY|3.0|I liked it, but many of her other books are much better.  Not boring, but not exciting either. Could have been much better.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I am really enjoying this game. Playing every chance that I get. Some levels are so hard I am stuck. It is worth having.
B0084TWN9K|5.0|Short stories but all about  a time in small towns in Canada when life was smaller, but just as complicated.
B0091REZMW|4.0|It passes the time by pretty quickly... My family and I just love to play these games all the time.
006117758X|3.0|The book is just not my usual genre.  I don't think it is a bad book at all.  I will probably read it again in the future.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|Rio was entertaining for my seven year old and myself. Cute story full of adventure!  The only thing missing was a clear message at the end reminding people not to purchase any birds to stick in cages.
B00B1EEKM8|5.0|C'mon it's Jurassic Park!  What's not to like?  Spielberg, state of the art special effects, a great John Williams score and dinosaurs!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is the the best game to play. it even has a viedo to show you how to play the first time you play it and it sipmle
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|There has been so many do this do that and get this many lives, extra moves, extra this and that's..you do all it says to do over and over and nothing happens. This is a fun game and a lot of people love it! What if all stop playing just because all the hassle!?!?  Then WHAT????
B001DJLCRC|5.0|I don't know how I missed this show for 5 years, but I'm all caught up know and ready for the finish!
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Odd English aside (no more move), this game is addicting and fun. I  has more levels than most free games.
1455523550|5.0|It's a great book!<br />I love Sparks!<br />He has the one way to write about love, hope and new life.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Beautiful blu ray transfers, especially Alien. It will take you quite some time to get through all the extras but if you like them as I do, you'll be in hog heaven.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|Excellent just as promised , I use it everyday stands up sturdy, well worth the money. Excellent present for anyone owns  the Kindle
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Exciting adventure, loved every second of it, mysterious, adventurous and extraordinary.  Highly recommended, fun for all ages, good start to a wonderful series.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I like this weather app best of the different weather apps, especially after another popular one (TWC) changed their layout. This one alerts you of warnings and watches for your area without the app needing to be open.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Wish I could give it six stars! The perfect blend of the X men and  Indiana Jones, I was delightfully lost in Miss Peregrin's world for days.
B0058Z4NR8|1.0|This was seriously flawed book - see Bill Gates and Jeffrey Sachs reviews - by two men who looked for examples to fit their thesis and did not do a very good job at that.  They seem to think they have solved the question of why some nations fail and other succeed, and their answer is good governance; and, is doing, debunk the theories based on geography, culture, religion and climate.  Of course, good governance is necessary, but the real question is why some countries have good governance and others do not.<br /><br />They spend a lot of time on England and the debt it owed to the Glorious Revolution in the 17th century and say little about the geographic advantage of being an island in that century of religious wars and not being dragged into the battles on the continent and the switch to a religion that was development friendly.  Then comes  the industrial success of the 19th century, and no emphasis on the good fortune of being one of four places that had the benefit of coal and iron in close proximity - the Saar, American Midwest and Manchuria being the others.<br /><br />Then on to one of my favorite subjects Venice, and they talk about the reason for its decline and failure to recover being its loss of good governance.  No mention of the Turks taking Constantinope in 1492 and gaining control of the eastern Mediterranean.  With that I had enough.
0547258305|5.0|Love this series! This book is highly addictive and very well written. I love the characters, and had to get Fire immediately after reading Graceling.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|The camera takes good pictures, and is easy to use but since the Kindle has only a lens pointed toward the user, a person needs to be pretty imaginative to get into a position to take a picture except of the user's face.
B008NCSZQ8|1.0|Obviously written with prepubescent boys in mind, no self respecting person of any age could consider this anything but rubbish.
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|I thought this was the game.  I know how to play this but it wasn't what I thought it was so I deleted it.  I don't have this on my  device.
B0058SNI94|5.0|These shoes are comfortable and fit true to size. I now own two pairs in different colors. Great for casual wear.
B006IGZWB2|1.0|I'm old enough to remember the civil rights movement, so maybe that's part of why this didn't work for me. I first tried reading the highly touted book but I was so put off by the dialect that I couldn't even make it through the first page, so I don't know why I thought the movie would be better. It's not. There is no subtlety in this movie; characters are either completely good (e.g., Skeeter and Aibilene and impish Minny) or completely cruel and beyond redemption, e.g., Hilly. All of which I could have tolerated, and written off the movie as yet another over-rated chick-flick, were it not for the PIE. The whole thing was so predictable but so unlikely, and so puerile. And the joke just goes on and on and on...ad nauseum, in this over rated, overly long movie. But if you like the idea of a movie where the premise is that a socially sensitive, privileged white chick helps a bunch of poor black maids to stand up for themselves, and in the process, realize how lucky they are to know her, well, then you're gonna love this flick. As for me, my thought when the credits finally rolled was shoot that's 146 minutes of my life that I'll never get back. *sigh*
B000HEVALC|5.0|I picked up a tape of the Million Dollar Quartet recording at a garage sale a few months ago and listened to it on a loop for weeks! This is one of the best albums ever. When I upgraded to a car with a CD player I also upgraded my Million Dollar Quartet because I cannot live without it! I highly recommend this to anybody who loves Elvis and great country music. This is perfect for a road trip!
B004GYY714|4.0|I have found radio shows I like from around the country which are not carried locally.  I.E. &#34;Jeff & Jerr Showgram&#34; in San Diego, CA and &#34;Imus in the Morning&#34; out of New York.  I also like listening to Smooth Jazz which we no longer have in our Portland, OR area.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|I was waiting for some things to download, so i decided to watch this. Excellent movie. I would watch it again, and recommend to anyone.
B00DGKQF2S|5.0|Much sweeter songwriting than I expected. Also a fair bit more technical than I expected, but in more of a fusion direction, less of a prog direction. Very cool album with a great vibe, sure to satisfy classic rock fans and really anyone who likes great players who play great hard rock music.
B00C7JGDBW|2.0|The story is about a magician (Oscar Diggs or The Wizard) who wants to be great.  While trying to escape in his balloon because a fellow carnival worker is angered by Oscar toying with a woman's affection, he is caught up in a tornado.  Oscar lands in OZ where his knowledge of magic and techniques are useful, because the residence are simple people.  His first meeting is with Theodora, the witch of the west.  She believes him to be the prophesied wizard and quickly falls in love with him as he romances her.  He breaks her heart by not returning her love at which time she turns into the evil witch of the west.  Besides Oscar being self serving, one thing that bothers me about the story line is, there are three witches with magical powers, why do they need a man with carnival tricks.  Yet he seems to save the day and save Glenda the good witch.<br />The scenery starts out black and white, like the classic \\"Wizard of OZ\\" with Judy Garland.  In OZ the scenery is absolutely beautiful!  Unfortunately that is about all I can recommend.  The script seemed weak and for the most part the acting didn't help, although I'm sure they tried.  Except for the brilliant colors, very little to keep children's attention or adults.
B00ATU5JRA|1.0|It's supposed to make others think that you have a device that hacks into other devices. It's stupid, and I deleted it immediately.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game that makes you think and passes the time very addictive and not so hard that it frustrates you but not too easy either.
B00DYTKKGI|5.0|I have friends that are 6 and younger and the love this game so if your 6 or younger get this game
B000093FLA|1.0|Brand new disc, did not play in my American made blu ray/ dvd player... Tried it 3X, to no avail. A screen populates stating that it is not compatible? SMH...LAME.
0544104404|4.0|This book was very interesting because it approched teaching and student learning from a different perspective.  Instead of learning being tied to test scores, the book examines other ways in which students succeed based on things other than book learning, such as character development, curiosity about the world, and determnation.
B008220BLG|5.0|The CD arrived promptly and was well packaged.  I've been enjoying watching the film.  Absolutely no complaints from me this time!
B002M9WW30|4.0|If you loved Rocky growing up this is a must have.  The movies look great and sound great.  The extras are a bit lacking on this collection. All in all a great buy for the price.
