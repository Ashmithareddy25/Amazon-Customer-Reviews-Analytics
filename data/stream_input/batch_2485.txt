B00CATSONE|5.0|For all those people who consider yourself 'creative' or a 'lucid thinker', you must read this book! Thank you Sean for writing it. Tesla has always been one of my personal favorite minds and I thought you presented his life well. I really didn't expect much except a bio on Tesla but I must say I had many moments that had my brain 'kickstarting' again. Thanks. A very good reading experience.
B005HEPN06|5.0|The fourth season of Star Trek:  The Next Generation was awesome!  They set the bar on science fiction appealing to a wider audience.
B00B2166BS|4.0|Love the convenience of using this pogo cable. However, the cord is too short. It is a good thing that the connector pops right off, otherwise the short cable would result in constantly yanking on the charging port. It was overpriced too, but I bought it as soon as it hit the market. It may have (should have) dropped in price since then.
B0037B6QSY|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. The bite sized sections allow you to practice each piece so you can really understand each concept.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Interesting series. Besides the rather licentious scene at the end of the 1st episode it has been pretty clean and interesting.
B006M4F67A|4.0|I am a new player to Mahjong, but I liked playing this game. I liked the different levels of the game.
B001RXB4FY|4.0|Excellent musicians.  The music is not limited.  They go from Metallica to Green Day, hints of Aerosmith and Sabbath.  You want some rock?  This ROCKS!!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Facebook works well on the kindle.  The pictures are clear and it updates well.  I can also add my status easily on there.
B0098460O4|5.0|This CD is simply the best CD that I have purchased in the past 3 years.  These two have a most definite future in music.  This from a die hard rock and roller.
B007PKDW44|5.0|Born and raised on Aerosmith, Sabbath, Teddy, Heart, Journey, Rush, ACDC, Van Halen, Zeppelin, so much 60s and 70s rock would make your head spin.  These guys flat out rock!  This will not disappoint.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|It's always important to check the weather and find out what's going on.  Especially when there were tornados all around us!
B00A8MGLAI|4.0|I was very much looking forward to seeing Cloud Atlas and as soon as I could I blind purchased it. Do I regret it?<br /><br />Cloud Atlas is a commitment. It is not a movie you just pop in to be entertained, it is a film in which you dedicate almost three hours of your life to unraveling the complicated interwoven stories which may or may not be connected or may or may not spike your interest. I must admit, some of the stories did not interest me at all, however there was one or two which I really found interesting. Movies are meant to entertain and be popcorn flicks. Films are meant to tell a story and convey a message which the director and writer are trying to drill into your head.<br /><br />You really need to pay attention to Cloud Atlas. Not many films are like it, however movies like The Tempest come to mind where the film is very difficult to view and seemingly complicated when in actuality it is not. These movies are rare, original and beautifully complicated to a magnificent degree.<br /><br />The acting is great. The Blu-ray PQ & AQ is great and the over-all direction and presentation is spectacular. So what is lacking? The movie simply is so choppy it is difficult to watch, understand and comprehend. Part of me cannot wait to watch it again, however another part of me has no desire to view it again.<br /><br />Do I recommend blind buying it? No.<br /><br />Do I recommend renting it? Yes, very much so.<br /><br />Do I regret blind buying it? A little as I find it may be a very long time until I have the strength to watch it again.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This CD is wonderful, relaxing, and inspiring. It is my first CD from the group and I am so glad it was recommended to me. I am now a fan!
B006YM9JSW|5.0|Works fast... Built a new desktop and it is about twice the speed of my old PC. I am not heavy duty into the tech bits, but by using other peoples reviews and comparing prices, I was able to make a good decision for buying this processor.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I enjoy the game. It is fun to try to continually get higher scores.  It is also fun to challenge others.
B009GX69RK|5.0|Best season yet! It is worth the extra money to buy the HD version. Much sharper image and better quality when played on your computer. Schmidt is hillarious, as usual, and spends most of the season trying to win back CeCe. Jess and Nick finally admit how they feel about each other and explore thier relationship. Season 2 is Filled with TONS of laugh out loud moments and every episode just gets better.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|It's the perfect puzzle game. Not a hidden object, run of the mill mystery game, but a genuine puzzle game. It's kind of like the game version of the move The Cube! Challenging and makes you use your brain. I love it and want more! Well worth the money!
B002ELIXCA|1.0|It's amazing to me how many people want to witness acts of sadism. We - as a society - are a bunch of sick puppies. It's one thing to come across that in a movie, where it is necessary to move the plot along, but quite another to tune in to it week after week. Are we really that angry? Are we really that frustrated in our lives? Do we really want to fantasize about people, even bad people, being tortured?
B000AMPZF8|5.0|Muse is the s***. I love them. I think they're the best band in the world. Buy this album it's the s***.
B006RXQ800|5.0|Watched this tonight with my husband and uncle.  Definitely had to look away through some of the bloody bits (I'm a bit squeamish), but excellent nonetheless.  Couldn't stop watching!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was fantastically designed. But I really hate certain plot twists! What was the point of it? What.... Exactly who their right mind would create such a.... torturous series of events!? Oh that's right... Suzanne Collins.... I have to admit I love this book to no end... but really....<br /><br />Fabulous.... but Disgusting
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Finally on kindle fires, and it is<br />A good games<br />I think I could have more levels and car's Maybe have the tank shoot
B00821OX98|4.0|This show got better and better as the season went on... Just finished the second and can't wait for the third.
B004SIP8JI|4.0|If you are looking for a fun, sweet movie...this one fits the bill. It's nothing deep, but is an enjoyable time-travel romance.
B00CHNKJFO|4.0|GREAT GAME! Responsive controls, addictive gameplay makes this one of the best pinball apps that I've ever played. ZEN MAKES MAGIC YET AGAIN.
B00AKKTDJY|4.0|i love this game, I think I have played just about all of the series. The cake one is good too.
B000P0J0A6|4.0|This was a blast from the past that I remember watching when I was about her age. It was as fun to watch this time around. Just goofy fun from Spielberg!
0345529057|5.0|I cannot get enough of Game of Thrones ever since the first episode aired on HBO I knew I had to read the books.  Have not been disappointed with it.  Money well spent!
B0076DELIG|5.0|I am a big Michael Connelly fan and find this, as well as most of his writing, very worthwhile.  It is exciting how he ties threads of the past into a current murder.  It is well written and kept my interest from start of finish.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This is a good story to read in the summer.  The characters and story<br />line were more developed and I liked them better than the movie.
B0044LYRG4|5.0|To my friends.  The little girl that they was for name is Khloee. She liked themvery much. She watched them with her brother.
B00CHCUR9I|1.0|I would probably love it as I am a big walking dead fan, however, this would not download to my fire-just says its not compatible with this device. Hopefully Amazon will look into and fix this issue!
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|The cinematography is breathtaking and the film is very true to the book - a rarity in the book to film transition. Thoroughly enjoyable.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I like the kindle conversion. It has features that make it more appealing than the on line pinterest. Since joining pinterest I have reviewed my love of alert in many forms and feel that it is one of my new passions that has led to my renewal of my own art resurgence. I can't say enough good things about it.
B000I5X80G|5.0|i am not a neil young fanatic..i am a fan of rock and roll jams. this cd has 2,, down by the river and cowgirl in the sand, which are awesome.. the whole release is excellent !!!  crazy horse is a great band and all these guys were special music talents ... this cd is a perfect summary of what was going down in the early 70's.. i believe the proper word is historic !!
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|After reading all the reviews I have decided not to buy this 3D video. Can't understand why it is so expensive without the other format packaging. I hardly ever use the other formats but I do expect a price reduction when they are not included.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It is large and very easy to use.  I am happy to have it in such a convenient and accessible way.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Richard Feynman, the award winning physicist who worked on the Manhattan Project, moved to Rio de Janeiro after the atomic explosions to learn the language and play in a marimba band. He is famously quoted as saying that no scientific discovery would ever come from people south of the Equator due to the Latino machismo. As much as I venerate Feynman, the deep appreciation for spiritual expression in the written word that Paolo Coehlo that I feel, is more than scientific excellence. It is excellence of the heart.
1423140591|4.0|Can't wait to read, but i wish they would've kept it first person point of veiw. For us who have read percy jackson and the olympians, were used to it. it just ffeels weird reading the sample. Wonder if these will become movies.Hope not.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|I believe that this book shows not to judge a book by its cover.<br />It has amazing twists YOU NEED TO READ THIS BOOK
1451697686|3.0|Almost everything in the book was and is on the blog, so for me it was a \\"re-read\\" that cost $15 and a lot of paper.<br />I do commend this family for their continued effort to reduce waste & they have a done a great job doing so, yet philosophically, I do not find their total lifestyle to be particularly eco friendly or real.<br />Regarding food, the recommendation is to reduce waste by buying bulk food. First of all, unless you are in California or a major city, your bulk bin options are probably few and far between, we'd have to eat nuts and candy if I depended upon them. In addition, many of the bulk foods are white flour based breads, pasta, cookies, etc. If it's between packaging and eating valueless food, I will choose packaging. Whole foods are just better for your heath, even if they come in a paper bag.<br />In addition, Bea speaks of coming to America and being obsessed with materialism, now changed to zero waste non consumerism. They don't make garbage... yet her home -which is stunning- is a showcase of top end appliances, remodeling, furniture, etc. Somehow I cannot believe that she found sub zero drawer refrigeration at a yard sale....so somewhere along the way someone has done some very high end shopping in the zero waste home.<br />There are also things that disturb me, like references to gas being better than wood... a fossil fuel, really?<br />Are those vinyl floors? And carpet? And plastic molded furniture?<br />What about eco friendly reclaimed flooring? Refurbished appliances? Furniture made from old barn boards, etc. I think people would learn more real information if they visited an eco village and you'll learn a lot more about saving the planet by living closer to it. And growing your own food. And using reclaimed building products. Etc.<br />Again, there are some useful ideas (reuse your grocery bags) but I think many of us in the \\"eco\\" world are already doing this, as well as using Earth friendly cleaners, etc.<br />It's a good experiment and there are many things to learn, but I don't think this is the answer to our ecological problems.and there are many things to learn, but I don't think this is the answer to our ecological problems.
B0094K1JPC|5.0|Funny, fast paced, contrasting a couple of dysfunctional yet true to life people.  Twists abound as the story unfolds adn characters grow.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Surfing in Tokyo city. Grabbing all those power ups. I enjoy playing and my little bothers love it. Keep the good work up you guys!!!
B0089LOG02|4.0|It may not be true but it is based on fact - the Orphan Train really did run across America trying to find adoptive parents for orphan children.<br />What a barbaric way to do it although they felt they were helping and, at the time, it probably seemed a kind way to help orphans to a better life although in so many cases they delivered them to sadistic &#34;users&#34;.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I started this book on my trip to Vancouver.  I couldn't put it down.  It is very well written and captivating.  I wish I had her courage.
B0000CABJ1|5.0|I think that it was one of the best compilations of her songs, and you will have great pleasure listening to, in a very nicely recorded CDs.
B005VPXNV2|4.0|A repeat for me but was still a good movie, if you have not seen it you are missing out on a really good movie
B00A81MV3U|5.0|Life isn't perfect, but it could be worse.  At least you're not manic-depressive, you didn't catch your wife cheating on you,  you didn't beat the crap out of the guy, you weren't sent to 8 months in a mental institution, and you're not now released and obsessed with getting back together with your wife.  (Well, you're probably not ALL of those.)  Pat (Bradley Cooper) has these things going against him, but he's getting better, and he's worked out a mental health aid that always has him looking for a silver lining in every situation.  After his release, he soon meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), sister of his friend's wife, whose own cop husband has been slain in the line of duty.  His father Pat Sr. (Robert De Niro) is currently unemployed but is making money as a bookie for football game bets.<br /><br />I suppose they file this one under \\"romantic comedy\\" but it's not really a laugh out loud type of movie, neither is it exactly a black comedy.  There is some occassional humor to it.  This is not your stereotypical \\"chick flick\\" by any stretch of the imagination.  The acting was very well done- all the characters felt like real people.  Damaged people, messed up people, but real.<br /><br />If you liked \\"As Good as it Gets,\\" and/or \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" you should like this movie.<br /><br />Rated R for some violence and nudity (when Pat catches his wife cheating on him.)<br /><br />Single disc DVD features<br />-Previews for \\"Django Unchained,\\" \\"The Master,\\" \\"A Late Quartet\\"<br />-25 minutes of deleted scenes<br />-Silver Linings Playbook: The Movie that become a Movement (28 min)<br />-Dance Rehearsal (1 min)<br />-Going Steadicam with Bradley Cooper (1 min)
B004SKJTY6|1.0|I thought I was getting the entire movie for free. Waste of time. Did not convince me to either buy the movie or not. Waste of time.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I was hoping for a much longer game, but it was full of neat puzzles. By the time I finished, I felt like I'd only played a &quot;tease&quot; version instead of a full game.  Will consider playing the next Room game.
B000WOXQDM|5.0|I love this album. This is the best of No Doubt. I wish they would go back to their roots and make another album like TK.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Okay, I'll admit it. I like connecting dots. Sure, it sounds easy enough, but this. game makes it fun. So simple, it' s genius. Still play this one on occasion.
0062124293|3.0|I purchased this book after listening to an interview with Moran on the radio.  Her biting British humor was charming via that medium.  However, the book reads much heavier and negative.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|For being &#34;The Official Game&#34;, I was expecting something based loosely on the movie. The voices were aweful and the tilt and touch controls seemed glitchy ( maybe user error) :). Okay game, but you'll have to spend $ if you want to advance quickly.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is sooo much fun! I cant put it down. It has objective after objective so you never get bored while playing it. The tasks may be like, run 5000 meters without tripping or collect 1 million points without power ups. Definitely a good buy.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|I really enjoyed this game while it lasted. I had advanced pretty far before the game glitched. When I reopened the game, all progress had been lost. Disappointed, I deleted it from my Kindle. Fun while it lasted.
B000LB7G00|5.0|Nice and smooth operation. Great build quality.  Comes in handy when you want to multitask , as in rotate the 3d model into the next orientation as ur mouse is selected the next tool you need. Very useful .
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I've played all the game varieties - hoping that one will be less addicting than the others - but no such luck.  It's hard to put down, until you can beat your last time or score!
B00006WL2B|1.0|What a surprise to get a DG SACD!! Karajan, Beethoven, the 9th, SACD. A direct pass to heaven you can think. What a disappoint. Not the best but a great version of this canonical Beethoven work. You´ll expect a great quality in the sound right? Avoid it!! Not descriptive at all, poor in volume and sound range, even in surround configuration. I´ve tried in different equipment configuration, since a consumer amplifiers to semipro, same case. Please buy the same standard CD version (sounds far better than this) and keep some money in your pocket.
B004YXE438|4.0|I hope there are updates with more puzzles added.  I have a puzzle app on my iPhone that is a puzzle a day - guess I was hoping this app would be something like that.  Other than that, the puzzles are good and challenging if you have the levels set high enough.
B0091REZMW|1.0|I can't say anything about game play, but I couldn't even get this game to open up on my Kindle Fire HD. I tried to download it twice.  Finally just deleted it for good.
B000PKX2KA|4.0|excellent GPS receiver. does all its supposed to, accurate and fast. only issue i had is with my laptop i needed to run Franson GPSgate because it kept freezing my laptop while running my mapping software. from what i understand this is a known issue.

0143122061|5.0|Although the book is called Civilization rather is the rise and fall of civilizations or why some countries are rich and others poor, something that has been discussed in many texts by other authors. And although it is divided into six chapters that supposedly played each of the issues that give title to the chapter, it is actually a hodgepodge of data. Sometimes is about the style of Jared Diamond or Paul Johnson discusses how the issues. But none of this detracts one iota of interest in the book, which in my opinion, is very good, with a focus on different aspects of what is considered the dominant civilization of modern times, from its origins to the present, with somewhat pessimistic approach but based on historical background.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I am a user interface designer, human factors specialist, and this calculator app is remarkably easy to use . . . starting with the large keys.  This design feature is at the other end of the continuum from all the tiny keys on our smartphones.  Big keys are excellent for short-duration data entry tasks; however, for tasks in which you are entering a large amount of data, the large center-to-center key distances between the buttons actually slows down the data entry activity.  One think I would like to see are a few statistical analysis aids, such as the sum of X squared, and other similar features to assist in behavioral quantitative analysis.  The downside in this approach is that any addition to the features available on the key board detracts from its ease of use.  Peter  peter1756@yahoo.com
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a brilliant game it is so addictive I have been playing non-stop trying to get the highscore and beat all my facebook friends. It connects to facebook and whilst your playing it gives you the score of one of your facebook friends to beat then once you beat you move up to a higher score and so on till your first an amazing game.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This game is way better than I thought it would be, it plays just like a grand theft auto and I'm happy I won't get bored anymore

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I LOVE IT This game (subway surfers) is totally awesome I've only been playing This game for a little while but already im so hooked..
B003CMGE2Q|5.0|I found this movie to be not only entertaining but very well performed. The wonders of watching how planes were created. Going back to the Wright Brothers. Faye Dunaway done a brilliant job in her performance as Elaine. Her character was so creative and yet she was so protective of Axel. GREAT JOB FAYE!! Johnny Depp was incredible in this movie as well. Playing Axel was a tough job but in the end very rewarding. Watching him throughout this movie working and trying to make a plane that flys was interesting. Such a cute comedy with lots of twists and turns. Jerry Lewis was terrific and such a sense of humor. Very good job. If you like comedy's and things that's a bit bizarre you will love this. This is a masterpiece!! WAY TO GO EMIR for creating this spectacular film and your creative thinking. 👍👍
B003N7ORNI|5.0|Great book for 7-15 year old readers and probably one of the best books I have read, but all stories in this series relate to this one and have no mistakes with saying something didnt happen when it did or the other way around but nonetheless it can get you feeling their feelings and that kind of stuff so read about 20 minutes to 90 minutes
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is something I can kill time with. The ordinary version of many types of solitaire. Keeps the brain busy!

B0031RS2HC|3.0|Not my favourite of the Jack Reacher books, but still not bad if you like the series. Obviously, being the first book, it does provide some back ground regarding Jack Reacher's personal history.

B00BWBHIUG|5.0|what's a time killer.  nice graphics.  fun when waiting for someone or when really bored..<br /><br />wish the game would give more free pearls.
0743455967|5.0|I do not like Stephen Kings books because I'm not a fan of his typical horror genre.  This book, however, is mostly an autobiography and a fascinating, deep one at that.  It gave me a tremendous appreciation for Stephen King, the man, and all that he has accomplished through sheer hard work despite a difficult upbringing.  It also sensitively details his devastating and life-changing accident when he was hit by a drunk driver. Really gave some important life lessons and filled me with respect.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love Downton Abbey.  Amazon is far quicker at getting the first 3 series made available than Netflix.  I highly recommend Downton Abbey to anyone who likes historical shows, great storyline and excellent cast.
B004H1V5RU|1.0|Why create an amazing product idea, yet make it so poorly that it breaks extremely easily?  Yes, the company will replace it, but whatever replacement you get will break equally fast/easily.  In the end, this is a very expensive toy that won't last.  I wish I could recommend it, but I cannot.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|awesome game and free too. I saw all friends had on the apple devices and I was disappoint that you could not get for the knidle but I can now
B0090OW7J4|5.0|Can't wait to see him in concert this summer in Maine!  Not as good as his Slow Turning album, but then, NOTHING is!  This is more of the same great Hiatt music and fans won't be disappointed.  I recommend it!
0425252868|5.0|A very personal, reveallng story of two men on opposite sides of the battle.  Couldn't put the book down and appreciated to amazing story of the author, Adam Makos.
159420229X|5.0|These memory exercises do work.  That said, even if you don't want to apply what you've learned here, the story itself is most interesting and worth reading.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Have not yet seen the movie, but don't feel one needs to see it having read this true account.  It helps understand the bravery of these Special Ops personnel who are not often able to be recognized for their loyalty and patriotism.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I didn't find it too interesting.  The plot was a bit confusing.  I found it to be too gory.  I certainly would not recommend it for children.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This man's account of his life beyond death's experience was fascinating and encouraging.  Though the skeptics may negatively respond, Dr. Alexander's story is approached from a personal point of view but a scientist's rationale.  The medical definitions and explanations were helpful to support his story for someone who is not familiar with medical terms.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|If your device cant tilt in temple run then this app would be good for you. If you are tired of tilting in temple run this would be a good app for you too. I'm not saying temple run is bad though.

B005IQZB14|5.0|Cheryl Strayed nails the thoughts and struggles of someone who hit her personal bottom and made that decision to go below the surface to try to understand and acknowledge the pain she felt. The loneliness. The hole in her heart. Brave and infinitely stronger than she realized, Strayed is triumphant in her journey

B0088W6IMQ|4.0|Excellent. HD version is as if on a big screen movie theater.  Highly recommend to anyone who likes sci-fi at a high level.
B006PTNQGU|4.0|Great movie for the whole family. This movie talks about what is really important in life rather than money. Wholesome adventure with characters worthy of emulating.
B0033AI4PM|5.0|We all know this is the the movie that made Barbra a superstar. What can I say that hasn't already been said? Superior restoration, but buy it for the definitive performance by the &#34;greatest star.&#34;
B000FA5TTW|4.0|I love the fact that is written in 1st  person,  by  the main character,  who early in the book is brutally murdered.  It comes across from a totally different viewpoint.  I found myself glued to this book from the first page.  Good read.

B008KOTNVA|4.0|I ordered this set for basic computer and cell phone repair. I'll start by saying I repair computers and cell phones on the side and it is not my main profession, but I do a decent amount of work (a couple or more a month, usually).<br /><br />I really like this set but there are a few things I think could be improved on.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />- Comes with a great deal of bits, perfect for popular computer and cell phone repairs<br />- The quality of the tools / bits seems superior to a lot of other tools I've encountered<br />- Driver is magnetized, making removal of small screws a breeze<br />- Comes with flexible attachment for oddly placed screws<br />- Driver has a hole at the top, which can be used to create a T-handle for extra torque. (you can use the extender that comes with the set [it comes already in the driver, just pull it out] or you can use a smaller phillips head screwdriver or similar you have lying around)<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />- The plastic case it comes in is very poorly constructed (ifixit sells a wooden box case as well, but it is double the price...)<br />- The price isn't too outrageous but when considering similar products like [[ASIN:B000FGQ1G6 Boxer 30 Pcs 4mm Precision Screwdriver Set]] sells for less than half the price, I think it could come down a tiny bit<br />- I wish the set included an extension bit. It includes a flexible extension, but I would have rather had a short, non flexible one.<br /><br />All in all it is is a good set and I recommend it.

B003QSJVV2|4.0|Nicolas Cage is a natural, Robert Duvall is classic, and Angelina Jolie is beautiful. Mix the three together and it is tough to miss. The screenplay is a bit derivative and formulaic, but entertaining nonetheless. Classic action, chase scenes, a villain you love to hate and characters you love to love combine to make &#34;Gone in 60 Seconds&#34; an enjoyable accomopaniment to a bowl of pocorn ona Friday night.
B000JML90Y|5.0|Darwin did not rush into print with this: he painstaking laid out his reasoning and his evidence. Since then his opponents have scarcely advanced an argument that is not covered in this book, but science has moved on and amassed a wealth of evidence Darwin could hardly have dreamt of.
B0091REZMW|1.0|OK, so where's the adventure? Amazon should start a children's section for this and other boring &quot;hidden objects&quot; only games that only test your observation skills.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Good movie! Learned a little more about the Civil War. Acting was excellent want to watch it again. Emancipation of slavery has been good for our country

It is so easy to find an excuse&#34; &#34;I am too tired!&#34; or &#34;I have no room to work&#34; or &#34;I have no ideas!&#34;<br />Steven Pressfield's book &#34;The war of art&#34; tackles the subject of this resistance to 'just doing it&#34; with insight and lots of practical ideas to help us overcome the problem where it really starts -within us!
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I enjoyed this CD very much. I like his music and his easy going style. And I won't get tired of playing it over and over again. I would recommend it to a friend.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Great to fill in the back story to a favorite current TV series. Lawyers you will learn to love or hate.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Well, probably one of the few times a series ends with a cliffhanger that no one would have seen coming. The realistic events remind us about how it really was to live not that long ago. I am curious what the next season will bring to keep up with the drama

B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is addictive for sure.  I went through all of the levels already and now am going back to get stars for them all.  There are lots of levels in the free version and then when you have mastered all of them you can decide if you want to buy more levels.
B00CL50LEC|4.0|Mix between a comedy and a love story.  My teen daughter thought it was cute.  My older teen young man (17) didn't hate it.

B00AZNEW5G|1.0|This movie starts slowly and is quite boring until the end. I would not recommend it at all. Don't  waste your money
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I wish there were more than 3 books bc I seriously could not put the books. I highly recommend this trilogy!
B009T8XBBO|3.0|kinda boring not my kind of game. To kid like. Prefer more thinking kind of games. Get only if it is free app of the day.
B0092AKDQK|4.0|There is much to enjoy in this jumbo set of miscellaneous chamber music compositions. Most of the compositions are repertiore staples-Beethoven string trios, Brahms, plenty Dvorak, Franck etc. Some rarities such as the Spohr double quartet and a divertimento by Ernst Toch are also included. Recorded between 1951 and 1969 and taped in association with concerts given by Heifitz and Piatigorsky, these CDs are well worth acquiring. My general impression is that while the interpretations are never less that good, many tend to be on the brisk side and lack the ultimate sensitivity and poetry to make them totally satisfying. I would make an exception for the works where Artur Rubinstein is also featured (piano trios by Ravel, Mendelssohn and Tchaikovsky; the earliest recorded performances). Ever present throughout the set is the distinctive golden tone of Jascha Heifitz. Music lovers should be thankful to have these sound documents available.<br /><br />While many of the recordings are on the elderly side, the sound quality is generally very satisfactory-dryish but very clear and detailed. The presentation of the set is good; a useful booklet and each disc is encased in a cardboard sleeve with a reproduction of the original artwork. It is to be noted that some of the CDs have a short playing time of around 30 minutes. Nevertheless it will take some concentrated listening to get through all 21 discs. Warmly recommended.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Don't read this in public - you might blush! Ha. But seriously, you might. The first book is a little intense, but the second one is where he opens up...
B0001WGDX0|4.0|Bernstein's Beethoven cycle is very good if not the very greatest marketing led me to expect.  Maybe I had my expectations too high after hearing his marvelous Brahms' cycle. I say that out of regret, because I love this conductor (the most important musical figure in American history) and his VPO orchestra and these symphonies.  I can see they certainly have flashes of brilliance and moments of rare insight since I have been listening to Beethoven symphonies over 50 years. And I truly appreciate these while they are not a 40 year later reincarnation of Arturo Toscanini.<br /><br />For example, I have never heard a better performance of the First Symphony .  A great performance of the first movement of the 9th. The rest good and traditional.  I thought his performance of the 5th Symphony was great. Did we think a traditional tempo was beyond Bernstein?  As a matter of fact, most all of these symphonies are well played at fairly traditional tempos.  For all of what is called his \\"emotional\\" type of conducting, Bernstein was fastidious when it came to the composer's clear directive  markings.  These and his Brahms' cycle recordings are a case in point. What is speed relative to if not the other parts?<br /><br />Were there some disappointments? Some.  In the second movement of the Eroica, Bernstein has the tempos right on, but not enough muscle in the playing.  Talk about a place to be emotional!  We need some gritty direction and cutting strings here. (Szell/CO on Sony and Kempe/RPO on Testament put on clinics of how to conduct that music.)  I would have pushed the 3rd movement of the 5th a little harder. He seems to excel in the even number symphonies, even more so than the odd numbered.  I would have done the 4th movement of the 9th a lot more emphatically since it sets off  the 5th movement, the monumental chorale.  (Maybe Szell/Shaw's CO or Giulini's LSO offerings have ruined me.)<br /><br />Bernstein tries hard to be a great Beethovenian and is actually very good. I for one will never forget his great NYPO recording of the Missa Solemnis (Sony), which I still think to be extraordinary.  To me it is preferable to his later RCO effort in Amsterdam on DGG.  To me the greatest Beethoven conductor of the 2oth century was Arturo Toscanini. There are not many contemporary apples that fall close to that tree.  I can still hear his NBC Symphony Orchestra doing Beethoven's bass section in the 4th movement of the 9th. Too bad he is not available in modern sound. (I am not a Furtwangler <willy-nilly tempos> or a von Karajan <overstatement> fan. I listen to von Karajan's Wagner mostly. He is great and without equal to me on that music, although Rudolf Kempe was quite good.) Who to me is the best last half of the 20th century Beethoven conductor?  Rudolf Kempe stands right up there with the Royal Philharmonic and the Munchner Philharmoniker. Too bad we do not have more from him because of his untimely death.<br /><br />These Bernstein recordings are very good and should be added to your collection for their inherent worth as well as their bargain price. Get a piece of American/European legacy.

B00AG6Z92C|5.0|This man has a voice that is heavenly.  I can't understand all the words, I only have a little Italian, but I do understand the French  and most of the Spanish.  I could listen to this man all night.......oh, yeah, I have, love headphones
B008IBPMZG|5.0|I love period pieces, and this show has quality writing, acting, and sets. Its classic British TV at its best. I enjoy it very much.
0380730405|4.0|Narrated in the first person by an unnamed woman, Daphne du Maurier's novel \\"Rebecca\\" is as haunting as its namesake. This classic is the story of a naïve young woman who discovers that her husband has a few skeletons in the closet. It is a gothic psychological tale, the plot structure of which is both circular and Aristotelian because it begins and ends with the same scene and yet the rest of the story is one chronological flashback which reaches a climax and then quickly unfolds in the denouement. A general lack of defining time period elements adds to the timelessness and lasting quality of \\"Rebecca,\\" and the novel's horror is subtle yet lasting, particularly as du Maurier includes various plot twists which enhance the overall impact of the work.<br /><br />From a reader's perspective, enjoyment of the novel may be somewhat compromised by the narrator, who is often childish and neurotic. The other characters, while arguably static, each possess a telling personality that, when combined, increase the tale's existing tension. The story itself proceeds rather slowly until the pivotal revelation is made at the end of chapter nineteen, although du Maurier skillfully infuses details--the importance of which become evident during the final scenes of the story--with an evocatively gothic atmosphere of dread.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is really fun to play it.<br />You get to muck out the stalls, clean the paddock and groom your horse..
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I played this game on another device and I had to buy it. It is fun and me and my grandkids enjoy playing it.
0439023513|5.0|This book was so great! It drew me in from the start and I finished the book in one day. Of the three books, I love the the first and the third the best. This series is most definitely worth it.
B000XFCTG0|5.0|There was such a resurgence of interest in Bowie as a personality at the time Black Tie White Noise was released, but not enough in his musical pursuits for this album not to have disappeared from the cultural radar within weeks of it's release in 1993.<br /><br />It's a shame, and a true waste of a valuable resource, since it's aged far better than any of his other records from the nineties (and this is coming from a fan of nineties' Bowie albums, specifically 1.Outside and Earthling).  At least now, in the digital age, it can be discovered in this current wave of Bowie fandom surrounding his return to making albums and headlines (for once, mostly because of the album he's promoting).<br /><br />The cover versions are alive with wonder and suggestion of entirely new compositions existing within the established framework of the original hits.  Frantic and rapturous &#34;hit&#34;, Jump They Say, may be his most touching and personally moving track (tales of his sibling's struggles with the unravelling of the mind), and that's saying a lot, considering that many songs featured here are directly/indirectly coloured by his then newfound marital bliss.  Specifically, I appreciate his work on the saxophone more on this album than that of any other before or since (besides on the spacier material on Low and &#34;Heroes&#34;), as his note and textural choices paint a picture of his love for Iman, over and over again.<br /><br />Anyone who wants to skip the Bowie material of the eighties in order to connect his craft to the high watermark left by everything chronologically from Station To Station to Scary Monsters.............start here, and also pick up the equally (and criminally) overlooked soundtrack for The Buddha of Suburbia, which works as a sort of spiritual companion piece to BTWN.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Couldn't put in down!  Characters are amazing!  The ending was a non- ending and didn't go with the high quality plot of the rest of the story,  It left me not satisfied.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Confirming we have many of the same issues and self inflicted challenges, whether we discuss it or not. An affirming read! I am reminded the power of our choices impacts more than just ourselves. Lean In.
0618871713|5.0|I really loved this book.  The author/illustrator's eye for detail boggled my mind.  This graphic novel tells the story of what seems to have been a only a marginally happy childhood and adolescence that ends with a family tragedy. It does so with incredible tenderness and understanding which the author's words and illustrations convey beautifully.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to just about anyone, although some people might be shocked or put-off by the forthrightness of the author or the subject matter of this book.
B004I744AS|4.0|Good application. But not as thorough as could be. I do use it for my studies and it is a good tool.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game rocks!!!! the graphics are amazing and the mini monkeys are now one giant monkey! amazing!!!!! this is my new favorite app!
B0061PEAUY|5.0|I guess I was expecting the characters to be the same as the TV show that I love so much. OOP's I still liked the story and characters a great deal. Tempi in this one has a few flaws that I would never have suspected from the TV show. If you are thinking that reading her books would be a rehash of to show, WRONG!!! Go for it!!!!
B002NNA9N0|3.0|I didn't hang in to view it again in its entirety.  Got bored and moved on. Acting was very good.., just not in the mood for the story line because of all the suffering taking<br />place in the American work force and the greed of corporations
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|Absolutely loved!<br />This may very well be my favorite one in the series!<br /><br />Beautifully written- more intense adventures joined by relationships and romance!
B004P8A7J2|2.0|I was seriously depressed.  I didn't feel anything for the characters. We all now drugs lead to a horrible life, this just gives us another example.
B004SRPXWQ|2.0|What do you expect? Sometimes the mic doesn't pick up my voice or my son's voice. I don't know it that is a problem with my Kindle or the program. Regardless, this isn't going to blow your mind, but it will kill about 10 minutes of your life if that is what you are looking for.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|I know I know...Tom C. is weird. But his movies rock.  I love his character and he does a great job. The chick Lawyer is a little annoying. I recommended this movie.
B004TTHLBE|5.0|This is a fantastic novel and the 10th anniversary should remind readers that Gaimon is one of the best contemporary authors out there. If you don't own this, you are missing out.
B001XV3LSS|4.0|anything with her in it..is great.  The concept was good..and the story was good. I even like Mathew MC. and I don't like him as actor.
B000002C1W|5.0|I've been listening to Pink Floyd for years and this CD is undoubtedly not only the best Pink Floyd Album, but probability tied for best album ever made. I listen to this CD everyday before work/school, and it makes me feel amazing every morning, kind of like my own theme song.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|of course it was good.  Was is epic...NO. It's a chick movie. Josh D. is hot...even her horrible ex-husband is hot.  It's excatly what you would expect from a nicholas sparks movie..the only movie he did that was GREAT was THE NOTEBOOK.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I was great at this game. This was a great chance to have fun with the family and My friends.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my 8 year old daughter love this game - i have seeing her playing and I like it as well - love the fact you can take pictures of the horses and safe them - very nice
B004Q78QFO|5.0|Buy It! The first song and the last song are my favorites. I love the voodoo New Orleans sound and Dr Johns got it down. So walk on guilded splinters with the king of the zooloo and you wont be disappointed. I love  Danse Fambeaux too. You can let it play thru from start to finish.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|IT IS THE BEAT GAME EVVVVVVVER!!!!I could play it all day spectacula amazing and incredible can't describe it WOW!!!!!!! Totally the game to play.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|Inception was quite an interesting concept. It is an up dated version of consciousness for some, yet it's been in the minds of others for Ions. It's a futuristic version of human possibilities and leaps of faith. Leonardo DiCaprio is one of the wise choices for cast members and I've noticed that he is certainly gifted in his craft and will be acquiring many more admirers in the years to come. The movie gets an A+ in my book of Movie Reviews. I'd like to see more of it's type.
B00COHAUD4|5.0|i loved it although I thought it was more sad than scary, its still a great movie :) I loved it!
B00COHIFQS|2.0|The story just ravels apart by the end.  Can be scary, but overall, a grave disappointment given the talent involved.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|great game for kids and adults lol. I would recommend it for everyone . My granddaughters. love it they do need help with it. I suppose it's do to their age.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Throughout most of the book, I had trouble putting it down, but I was very disappointed when I got to the end.
B009KCUX3S|4.0|The author has taken into account proven good teaching methodology and it shows.  I bought the e-book version because my eyes no longer can tolerate the small print used for most of these books.  The e-book on my iPad really slows me down because reading the figures is time consuming and frustrating.  Maybe I should have bought the e-book for reading on the PC on a large screen display.
B00992CF6W|2.0|This game was not that fun. You can't do stuff that you can do on computer and it gets boring after a while. I would not pay 3.99 for this game
B00AAQWMB4|5.0|Finally a game requiring more than just luck!  One I didn't win the first time I played.  This is a keeper.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|its fun but I hate the adds. once you click out of the add it takes forever to get back to the game. I also get confused alot about what tab is what and stuff like that. but overall you should get the game.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This is a uniquely awesome game!  I usually don't play games on my phone, but this is one is great.  It's smart and challenging, as nice change of pace.<br />Keep up the good work!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Enjoyed this very much.  I am looking forward to the next book from the authors.  I am wondering if Alban lives.
B0013WI0PQ|5.0|What a great message about determination and overcoming life challenges. This movies should be retitled \\"Oliver Twist Meets Beethoven\\" as it puts a modern twist on the classic tale.
0316228532|4.0|This novel suffers from comparison to the Harry Potter series, only because HP succeeded on such a stratospheric level.  HP had the advantage of a slow crescendo, the patient accumulation of characters and plot lines, the unique relationship of author to readers that saw growth of the characters parallel to real time.<br /><br />A cursory comparison may show The Casual Vacancy to be distinctly different from HP.  Rowling has attempted to play with the edgier elements of literature, incorporating mature themes and language.  However, a deeper look shows that Rowling's preoccupations remain steadfast.  There are themes of childhood abandonment, the importance and responsibility of adult stewardship, the strength of unconditional love, personal defense through humor and intelligence.  Despite the actions and thoughts of many mean, despicable characters, she shows her catholic belief in human goodness.  Rowling, a classics scholar, knows her Sophocles.  Tragedy, uncourted but unavoidable, redeems heroes.<br /><br />Rowling is a master of ensemble action.  Here, a large cast of characters from upper middle to lower class, populating the small fictitious English town of Pagford, interact with several intersecting plot lines.  Barry Fairbrother, a member of the town council, unexpectedly dies of a brain aneurysm on the way to his anniversary dinner.  His death creates a \\"casual vacancy\\" on the town council, prompting competing interests to fill the position.  Rowling explores these competing interests throughout the novel.  A drug addicted mother and her two children live in public housing.  A Sikh Indian doctor, unhappy with her marriage and job, uses her position on the council to set social ills aright, and to confront her own unhappiness.  An abusive husband and father gets his comeuppance.  A noncommittal solicitor feels the results of his non-action.  A school counsellor with OCD is faced with real tragedy at home.  A wealthy grocery store owner and his superciliousbourgeois wife confront their own dishonesties.<br /><br />The strongest character in the book is a teenager named Krystal Wheedon.  Krystal is the 16-year-old daughter of a drug-addicted mother, Terri Wheedon.  They live in public housing, with Krystal's 3-year-old brother Robbie.  Terri's drug addiction and desperate life are poorly managed by the social service agencies, which largely fail the children.  The one adult who understood and believed in Krystal's capacity to succeed was Barry Fairbrother.  He had recruited her to row on a championship crew team in high school, but the team dissolved on his death.  Rowling's depiction of Krystal is sympathetic and true.  She is a complex character, motivated to seek love and kinship (with her absent half-siblings, her unknown father, her school counsellors, her dying great-grandmother), and to protect her brother and mother.<br /><br />In the book, one character (Fats Wall) acts despicably and dishonorably in the name of \\"authenticity.\\"  Rowling asks the reader to ponder the meaning of authenticity: does authenticity lie in action or in motivation?  Does authenticity mean unreflective action, regardless of consequence?  Does authenticity trump kindness---the kindness of white lies?<br /><br />Fats is the kind of immature character, like Draco Malfoy, who goes through a transformation that causes him to question his deepest beliefs.  Even when he was at his most unsympathetic, I had a feeling that Rowling was holding a trump card to save a second chance for him (like she did for Draco).  Rowling's sympathy toward misdirected kids, or maybe just kids who feel lost in an adult world, is clear.  I got the feeling that she was a lost child herself---a self-made child who survived.<br /><br />I also felt that the deepest sympathy for Krystal is because she is a victim of circumstances beyond her control.  Through it all, Krystal remains authentic.  She does not pursue authenticity as an outward armor or a facade, as Fats does, but possesses the authenticity of the desperate, and remains true even though she has the most to lose.<br /><br />I agree with the description of the book as a \\"dark comedy,\\" the way that Oscar Wilde's plays or \\"All's Well that Ends Well\\" are comedies.  There are unsavory characters and motivations.  Fate deals its hand remorselessly.  Yet it is an entertaining and finely crafted story, a social satire, a multifaceted puzzle.  Rowling is not an extraordinary stylist, nor did she ever claim to be.  She is, like Charles Dickens, a humanist who happens to be a gifted novelist.  She has much to offer, and I await happily.
B004LP3AYI|4.0|Nice read lots of  action and passion passionate read the next book would recommend this series to any fanciful reader

B003K1EYM6|5.0|It did the job on a trip to Europe where I posted all my camera photos through the I pad. Be sure to say no if your are asked if you want to delete photos after you have downloaded them to I pad. I said yes thinking it would delete the photos on the memory card on the camera. NO it deleted ALL THE PHOTOS.

B00CL50LEC|2.0|It's one of those movies where they show you all the best scenes in the trailer. Not worth the price...if you have to see it rent it.
B000KIPT30|5.0|I needed a Remote Mixer Solution and wasn't willing to pay over $1000 for the &#34;popular&#34; solution. Thinking outside the box, I decided to go with a Behringer 4 mic USB mixer, some cables and this 4 Headphone Amp - viola! I have a 4 person remote mixer system and I saved over $800.  4 items instead of 1 is a great deal when I saved so much money.
B002APU580|5.0|I love stories from this era.  It was heartwarming to see a shy aristrocrat fall in love.  It is typical of mother's with all daughters to marry them off as soon as possible - hopefully to someone with money to bail the family out of financial difficulties.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Where should I begin? Every single free minute I've had the past couple, of weeks, has found my hands holding George R. R. Martin's wonderful saga. I have cheered and felt devastating loss, for these incredible characters. Truly a wonderful read now I will return and read the series again, but at a sensible pace.<br />Thankfully we still have writers who can surprise us with such rich talent.

B005G26NJE|4.0|Gary Clark Jr's music is awesome.  The acoustic version of Things Are Changing now is wha t made me first take notice of him.  Its part of this EP.  You wont be disappointed.
B00AYB0SX4|3.0|I thought this movie was okay. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great. However, I always feel that it is hard to pull off a good horror movie. I mean, it is hard to really convince the audience that it is realistic, and things can become easily predictable. This movie is just as good as any other mediocre horror movie.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Terrific game - the authors are doing a great job - the most recent update is awesome!  Keep up the good work and I look forward to more updates.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|I don't recall ever hearing anyone that didn't rave about this movie. I decided to watch it for myself and I am so glad I did! Definitely going to be buying this one on DVD to keep. Jamie Foxx and Leonardo DiCaprio gave GREAT performances. But, I think Cristoph Waltz really stole the show. GREAT movie, definitely a must watch!
B005EVVESM|5.0|Excellent Maroon 5 c.d. Some great songs but not all.  It is a very light album and a must have for every Maroon 5 fan.
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|The Lorax is an adorable movie. My kids really love it, and I love it as well. I think that it teaches a wonderful lesson, especially in this day and age where everyone is out for themselves, to make money and not care who they hurt in the process or what they are doing to our beautiful earth!
B00B935SUY|5.0|Excellent &#34;behind the scenes&#34; look at the music industry in the 70's.  Felt like I was watching home video of the stars before they were stars.  Made you realize all the things that need to come together to become a star.  Almost more impressive was hearing what turned out to be hit songs in their development stage.  Well worth watching!
B0054JELS4|5.0|Best show on TV. Would rather watch it in syndication and on DVR, than a lot of the programs on  - especially &#34;reality&#34; shows. I like that there are 'good guys and gals' who win, and that it's okay to still be proud Americans.
B00933JF74|4.0|Townsmen IS fun and I wish they would make it for the PC as I don't really like playing heavy graphics games on my Kindle.. The game has is a bit selfish giving out 'Prestige' points but other then that it's fun to play.. There seem to be a couple of glitches in the, like getting a message that a 'townie' can't find his/her way home when they are standing right by a road that leads to the castle.. All in all it's cute but could use more buildings..
B009GEFXLC|4.0|We love Castle at our house, and have from season 1. Stoked to hear that it will be coming back for a 6th season. :)
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Love having this app on my kindle...it is fast paced and fun!  Also love that I can compete with my friends...
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great game.  The graphics are spectacular on my Kindle Fire HD.  The game itself is a bit hard at times but not to where you can't eventually figure out what to do.  I'm no expert at this type of game but I do love them.  I look forward to the next adventure!!
B009R659L8|5.0|Just when you think you have it solved, Mary Higgins throws in a twist.  Her style inot only involves the mystery, but also a possible romance.  In good taste all the way around.
B005SAYRA6|5.0|I like to be entertained and I found this movie to be very satisfying. Fast and furious 2 was a typically drab attempt to leach off a successful movie but Fast five brings back the finger gripping tight adventure I truly appreciate.
B005LAIIJY|1.0|Horrible, big mistake to buy this drivel.  Great concept: slave whose wife is sold off.  However, the violence factor is completely gratuitous, unnecessary.  No character development.  Horrible.  Never buy it.  Do not watch it.  Yuk.
B009MYARIK|5.0|This book was a little hard to keep up in the very beginning but once I got going, I could not put it down.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|Easy to use. Recommend it to anyone. Reasonable price. Five Starr review. Would purchase it again for another phone or tablet.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|Lacked the warmth of the Lord of the Rings trilogy for us. Long stretches felt more like watching a video game. Sad to see that technology so dominates mainstream movie-making now that stories we grew up with as the essence of enchantment are now saturated with a kind of hyper-realism that, in the end, stultifies rather than enhances the imagination.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|The plot was familiar but enough twists to disguise it for us-worked for us for a Friday night home, typical Tom Cruise unbelievable, but fun, muscle car chase scenes
B0016OLC5Q|5.0|As this movie goes on, it just gets better and better.  By the end, you are teary eyed, to say the least, and maybe outright crying.  It really makes you think, and feel for both the parents, and the kid.  Moving!
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|Got sucked in by the 4 star rating, but with such crap content who cares about great actors-made us both start looking for math and tax returns to work on...that bad
B0084670FU|4.0|At first I wasn't sure if this movies was going to be worth staying with, but as it went on it was apparent that it indeed was.  I mean, Pitt and Blanchett!  They simply don't make bad movies together.
B00CRWJ7VC|5.0|Movie was great, lots of intertwining of the stories. Excellent make up artists. Waited a very long time to see this movie and was not dissappointed
B00992CF6W|4.0|I like this game but it kind of sucks that it won't let me join servers with my friends because you have to have the same wifi or something. It barely glitches so that's good. But I wish you could get to make more stuff on Survival.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|Excellent performances by everyone---perfect casting---my  favorite movie by Quentin Tarantino.  Jamie Foxx and Christoph Waltz give perfect performances---as well as the rest of the cast.  The soundtrack is great and offers a very good compilation of songs.  I highly recommend both if you enjoy action, a cool plot with a great ending, and good music.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I read this book to have more to talk to my wife about.  It was a fairly good book.  It increased the sex in the house, that is always a good thing.
B005LAII94|5.0|Loved it!  Great cast, good story.  I saw it at the theatre and wanted to have a copy to watch at home.  Excellent performances by everyone.
B00CFOY244|5.0|Love the movie because of the suspense it entailed. Great psychological thriller!  I knew nothing about the movie when I originally saw it in the movies and thought after the movie took me on a good psychological ride.
B0015AARJI|5.0|This controller is for use for the PS3. It works like a charm and keeps a good charge! It seems extremely durable. Shipping was quick and the price could NOT be beat.<br /><br />Thanks!
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|This game is amazing and addictive! I love the graphics and the different worlds. It is well worth the dollar and much more.
1465001123|5.0|This was a hit! It has some great pictures in it with a good variety. It was a hit with our friends daughter. We got this for her knowing she was the biggest Taylor fan ever (ok ok, your daughter might be too ;)).  She loves it!<br /><br />Good quality. Great detail. Good pictures!
0765365278|4.0|The Way of Kings is a solid start to an epic saga, though it's bloated with exposition and quite slow to develop. Which is too bad because the book begins with a fantastic first scene.<br /><br />Maybe others enjoy a slow-developing story, but personally I prefer a bit quicker pace and a little more action. For what actually happens in The Way of Kings, it would've been better minus several hundred pages, in my opinion at least.<br /><br />That's not to say there's not a lot to love here. The world-building is fantastic, even if some aspects are rather difficult to take in (like all the sprens). The history is intriguing, the characters pretty good, the writing is solid, and the action scenes (when they happen) are very cool.<br /><br />Ironically, the previous book I read was by Brent Weeks, and he and Sanderson are kind of opposites - if you combined Sanderson's world building with Weeks's plot pacing, you'd have one hell of a fantasy writer!
0671688782|5.0|I've raised 6 foster-adopted children.  Three of them were too old when we discovered this method for it to be used. The other 3 were not.  The differences between the 2 groups is stark and clear.  The implications are profound.  The differences are truly frightening on the one side and heart-warming on the other.  The importance of this book is beyond measure.  Please allow me to share my experience with these children, who are now mostly grown.<br /><br />The first 3 (now a teenage boy and 2 adult women) are doing \\"OK\\" but always struggling.  They aren't in prison or addicted to drugs, so I consider that a victory.  But one has trouble being honest, sticking with anything, and holding a job.  The 2 others are unmarried mothers who have problems with intimacy and with holding jobs too.  Everything comes to them the hard way, plain and simple - because they never learned to trust.  People who can't trust also can't be trusted.  And when you can't trust, you can't truly accept or give love.  So these children of ours know what's right and what's wrong in their heads, but they have trouble holding on to it.  In their hearts, it's not real to them, because the obstacles to learning trust weren't conquered.<br /><br />They received traditional psychotherapy, which did next to nothing to help them.  Children with attachment problems aren't helped by traditional techniques, because it starts on the surface, and they are incredibly adapt at keeping it on that level.  Children who can't trust certainly aren't going to suddenly trust a therapist out of nowhere.  I know with little doubt that one of the therapists for one of our daughters was intimidated by her and walked on eggshells.  The other daughter ran circles around her therapist and had the woman wrapped around her little finger.  Our son received \\"play therapy\\" in addition to \\"talk,\\" and he did things to the toys that his therapist had no clue how to deal with.  Before long, she basically declared him cured and discharged him because she didn't know what do with him.  These children lived with us in a loving home with consistent discipline for at least part of their childhoods, which did make a difference, but love truly isn't always enough when the damage is severe.<br /><br />On the other side of the coin, the children who did receive holding therapy are completely different.  They had undergone severe neglect and abuse as well.  Holding therapy was the only way we could break through our toddler son's intense rage and lack of trust.  He was able to trust on a level not possible for the other children above, and he is now a loving young man with moral leadership abilities.  He contributes to society, not the reverse, and he has multiple employers wanting his services from an early age, because he's made a name for himself in our community, before he's even of working age.  Our 2 younger daughters are exceptional in their ability to trust and use good judgement.  They are delightful young ladies who empathize with others, do well in school, and are a pleasure to be around.<br /><br />The contrasts are stark and clear.  The implications are profound.<br /><br />This book's detractors seem mostly to be esoteric students invested in traditional psychotherapy or young people who thought that some form of holding therapy was done on them and they didn't like it.  If the holdings are NOT done long or thorough enough, this can happen.  For instance, we tried to perform holdings on the youngest of the 3 older children above, but his strength was too great, and we weren't able to physically stick it out until he reached the release stage.  So there was no point.  He strongly disliked it as a result, and there was no benefit under the circumstances, so we stopped.  But it was worth a try.  It could have made the difference in his life, but it was too late.<br /><br />And we ARE talking about lives here.  A form of therapy that can irritate some children but save the lives of others ISWORTH TRYING!  We're talking about the difference between raising a child who could turn into a psychopath or going the extra mile with this technique to help that child have a real and fulfilling life - and one that contributes to society.  The difference is that holding therapy changes children on a heart level, and it's their hearts that were broken.  You can't just talk to a child whose heart has been that broken at a young age.  It doesn't work, because they won't \\"let you in\\" to talk about what happened.  Very often, they can't even remember.  You have to enable them to break through their own pain and come out on the other side.<br /><br />Children whose hearts have been broken by divorce, loss of a significant care-taker from their lives, chronic physical illness, even children who are being raised by the TV or by daycare, could greatly benefit from these techniques too.  Several years ago, I sat across from a beautiful family of 2 parents and 2 children on a ferry boat returning from Martha's Vineyard.  The boy was involved in an electronic gadget, but the girl (maybe 5 years old) was trying desperately to get her mother's attention.  The mother's only interest was in working on her laptop, and she treated the girl like a worthless nuisance.  By their clothes, manners of speech, and mannerisms, they were obviously wealthy and successful, but the children appeared to need holding therapy in a very real way.  I thought to myself that I was watching the development of future CEO's who have no consciences.  It isn't only the adopted, the poor, or the disadvantaged who need this book.<br /><br />Read this book if you believe your child could benefit, and may it make a wonderful difference in the lives of you, your children, and the people they will eventually impact in their own lives!
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|Blake Shelton is a pillar of country music these days, and he is still staying true to his sound.  What you'd expect from him, a very solid album.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Wow, this book was just so draining to read. The general story earned two stars but the writing style, protagonist, and love story were all annoying at best.
B00CDT41RY|1.0|What a disappointment!  Movie drags on and is completely unrealistic.  Cruelty towards animals and humans.  Would not recommend to anyone.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|An excellent book, well written and illustrated. Everything you need to know to create and publish an e-book on Amazon is in this book.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I liked the ending to this series.I've read all the books and I feel like this one stayed true to the way Charlaine wanted it to end. Were you all really happy with Sookie being used and abused by the Supes book after book? She had finally had enough of living her life mixed up with all of their violence and drama so she cut her ties to them. She had thoughts of having a normal life,getting married,raising children- she couldn't have done those things with a vampire or werewolf.She dropped clues throughout the series that Sam was the most logical answer.Not being able to read his mind,being able to have babies with him made it possible to be as close to normal as she could have been.Sam was the one who truly stuck by her without an agenda,unlike Eric or Bill.Did you guys forget how each of them betrayed her over and over? Charlaine,I think you did a great job in closing out the series! I will miss the characters and the stories and I'm sad to see them go,but I have great memories!
B006M4F67A|5.0|One of the best games I have played. I get immense fun and satisfaction getting through each section and trying to get faster.
B00B2JSRAS|3.0|Interesting read, except this book should give credit to the creator of the  universe...In the beginning was the word and the word was God.....
B004B2RUX8|5.0|Good mastering of the classic.  should appeal to baby boomers like me and those less chronologically challenged.  well done, upbeat.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Good app to check local weather. Use it to check weather before going on motorcycle rides around town and traveling
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I put out off reading this for as long as I could, hoping book 6 was coming out.<br />I enjoy Mr. Martin's writing style a lot and like all the books in the series so far.<br />My only complaint about the series is how long it takes between the books.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I have alt of fun on this game it is very relaxing but one problem the buildings take up more than 11 hours sometimes but from that forward it's a good game
B005HSL626|4.0|Everyone in the family likes playing this easy game.<br />Simple enough for the 3 year old and entertaining for me.

1402547064|4.0|I love listening to these books. The narrator adds so much depth with her accents and cadence......I also love that the book speaks to the importance of &#34;small things&#34; in life and the entire story reflects that idea as well.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This is an excellent dramatic series. The casting is superb, as is the acting, and every episode is strong. Few TV series have shown such consistent high quality as The Good Wife.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Very fun game lots of animals good game for kids and adults. Challenging and wonderful graphics. Wish it was easier to get peanuts though but a lot of fun . :-)
B000VNMMR0|1.0|I am watching this today because I am bored as I work and looking for action distraction; I've never seen a BW film before and I have to say it's one of the silliest films I've ever seen - and the sidekick is even more sillier. Bruce Willis is a good actor, I'll grant him that - wish he'd done away with his sidekick early on in film and the film could have been less annoying. I don't think I will be watching another one of these. (this is written by a middle aged white woman so I probably have nothing in common with people who like the film. Everyone to his own.
0143117564|4.0|In Thomas Pyncheon's sixties surfer noir novel INHERENT VICE, a laid-back private detective gets tangled up in  a plot to kidnap a land developer when an ex-girlfriend comes to him for help.<br /><br />When his ex-old lady, Shasta Fay Hepworth shows up at Doc Sportello's apartment on Gordita Beach, the pothead private eye thinks he might be hallucinating at first. In fact, she's really there and she's come to him for help because the guy she's sleeping with--a millionaire land developer--is being targeted by his wife and her lover in a scheme to put him in \\"the booby hatch\\" so they can steal his money. Before Doc knows what's happening, he's dealing with celebrity cops, construction projects that are gobbling up poor neighborhoods, a bogus rehab facility, and a man who may or may not have died from a heroin overdose.  Not to mention a syndicate of dentists with their tax evasion scams.<br /><br />It's all kind of complicated and convoluted but it's also a lot of fun and not at all what readers might expect from Pyncheon, whose other books include GRAVITY'S RAINBOW and THE CRYING OF LOT 49.  Set in the tail end of the 60s, INHERENT VICE is a blast from the past that includes acutely observed social commentary and great, great characters that range from an angry young black man to Aryan biker gang members to Doc's friends and surrogate family who hang out at a local pizza place. His Aunt Reet is a woman ahead of her time, both in her embrace of technology and her disdain for the environmental exploitation represented by the missing millionaire.<br /><br />Also a standout in the large cast of characters is a cop nicknamed \\"Bigfoot\\" who makes a good side living as an advertising pitchman. (His persona is clearly inspired by the legendary LA car salesman Cal Worthington, which is a nice little bit of local color for readers in Southern California.)<br /><br />The book is filled with references to music and drugs and fashion (the women all wear print bikini bottoms and Country Joe and the Fish t-shirts) that really sell the period setting. Combine that setting with a story that involves unfaithful lovers and murderous intentions that's suffused with a purple haze of marijuana smoke and the result is a sunlit version of L.A. CONFIDENTIAL set a decade later with real estate rather than movies at its core.<br /><br />Pyncheon is in a playful mood here and readers will enjoy playing along.untry Joe and the Fish t-shirts) that really sell the period setting.

B009NG1Q96|2.0|I was hoping for more. It seems the book is truly only about the selection. If u were hoping for the story to evolve more, don't bother.

B00BFUUMO8|1.0|I was SO excited to see this app, but my expectations were not, to say the least, met. It refused to load past the intro screen. After waiting (and waiting some more) I ended up uninstalling it. Twice. Thank goodness it was free.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The beginning was slow and almost didn't finish the book but quickly found that I got lost in the pages and it became my escape.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Of course I'm biased, as I've been watching since the beginning.  I'd say this is the best season, bar none!  Can't wait for season 8, but can't imagine how it will end.  Unfortunately I don't get SHO, so have to watch it the next day on my computer.  However, I shop around for for the best prices on the DVD's & now own all 7 seasons.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Outstanding book and so were the three that followed.  Unless you have been under a rock for the last two years, I'm sure you have been aware of the story.  Try it you'll like it
B00CRVZRUS|5.0|When I became a Beatles fan, I was a little over a year late.  It started with \\"Yesterday\\".....well of course I had to see \\"HELP!\\".  This was my first Beatle movie I saw and I loved it.  I recorded it in Beta when it was shown on tv, then when the Beta was released I got that, then I recorded it in VHS and got it on VHS, then it came out on DVD and I got it on DVD THEN when they re did the whole thing once more, one big boxed package where they cropped the top and bottom of the screen to make it look like widescreen I got it again!<br /><br />It is MY favorite movie and I have fond memories of seeing it the first time when I was 11 years old, my mom took me to the drive in not letting me know she was going to do it.  I will be 60 this year and I can still vision the whole thing clearly.  It's a long story so I won't bother you with it.<br /><br />IF you are a TRUE 1st generation fan you know you HAVE to get it, for everyone else, this is and always will be a great movie.  I can watch this over and over and over again and still laugh.  I can also still hear my mother's laughter in all the right places.<br /><br />GET IT, you won't regret it.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I just started this game, but it's wonderful! The graphics are great, the game is enjoyable, and its just all around fun to play. I'd recommend for those who love park apps and animals, or just anyone looking for a wonderful app! Cheers, game creators! Perfect job!!
B00BVYLBP2|4.0|Great premise, nice acting from the heroine played by Tatiana Maslany and her many roles. Nice to see Matt Frewer in a bad-guy role.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I still cannot believe this only lasted 1 season. I love this series, the characters, humor, integrity. Once a year I watch the series thru, then follow it with Serentity. Good times.
B009H5IS1W|3.0|Since 2006, Criminal Minds, has been the only 'Network' television show that I watch (including news & sports). - Seriously~!<br />But I would be remiss if I didn't admit that for much of season 7 and most of season 8, CM's writers are clearly sabotaging the integrity of the once believable characters and their subsequent development.  Each one brings a unique quality to the team, and over the years that quality has been held in a delicate balance with a combination of personal & professional strengths, skills, performance, and a certain vulnerability that every human being has had to struggle with since the beginning of time ... that is, until the rise of the super-unnaturally perfect characters of JJ Jareau and Derek Morgan .  Since they were introduced, neither of these characters have shown even the slightest sign of a character defect or a professional/personal vulnerability - nor have either suffered so much as a nano-momentary lapse of judgement, or a kink in their vast intellect as they coolie overcome a wide range of nasty and highly dangerous serial killers without so much as breaking a sweat -- Simply put, Mogan and JJ have evolved into the omnipresent, omniscient, and omnipotent superhuman FBI agents without faults, without limitations, and without the defects that define us as human beings.  Perfection belongs to diamonds, not to FBI agents.<br />I do hope that the producers reel in this trend before it ruins the only decent show left on Network Television.<br /><br />On the upside - Matthew Gray Gubler has carefully molded his role as agent Spencer Reid into a character that can, and possibly will demand its own show.  Add to that, his skills behind the camera are clearly evolving and maturing with the episodes he directs offering us an even creepier voyage into the darkest abyss of the 'Criminal Mind' - His POV is part Steven King, part H.P. Lovecraft, and part Alfred Hitchcock.  Watch out for this guy, he is the Real Deal~!<br />Having said all that, the show is still the best Killer Thriller Drama that CBS, NBC, & ABC have to offer and I will no doubt keep making my plans around Wednesday night at 9:00 ~the show is still the best Killer Thriller Drama that CBS, NBC, & ABC have to offer and I will no doubt keep making my plans around Wednesday night at 9:00 ~

B00AB7HESI|5.0|My 7 year old loves this game and I enjoy playing it with him. He practices spelling and it is fun trying to figure out the puzzles. Worth 99 cents. Plays great on the fire.
B000FBFMZ2|5.0|I read this book six years ago. It was long, but interesting. Rereading it again at times past has brought me to a better understanding and a new love. A good mystery filled with science fiction grit. Moments of distaste and bad memories brought out from deep inside. The first and one of the greatest Richard K. Morgan novels available. Anyone with the stomach should read this book.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Hill Climb Racing is available for kindle fire!! I have been waiting months for this moment. I love hill climb racing. it is much better than all the other side view driving games. this is the app to get. great graphics. fun gameplay. it is the best. it is a must get

B00499NHLC|5.0|Love the show, just the right amount of drama, chemistry between Sherlock and Holmes brings the original stories to life!
B008220DIC|1.0|Okay my family went and rented this movie not sure what to expect from the movie as the description made little to no sense leaving no clue what to expect.  It seemed like a good mystery for a movie however once the movie got going it just showed of a man going through great deals of mixing different chemicals together to make different alcohol.<br /><br />After what seemed like a hour or so, there seemed to be no plot in the movie causing us to shut the movie off without finishing it.  This is truly a movie that isn't worth spending your money on.
B002ZG977Y|3.0|If you liked Lord of the rings, Wrath of the Titans and Harry Potter films than you will propbably like Clash of the Titans, it has a lot of special effects and action, not my sort opf film but I would recomend it if anyone is looking for a nice fantasy film.
B006M4F67A|4.0|great way to spend &#34;spare&#34; time- once you start you can't put it down. Challenging but not so difficult that you can't complete a game without using the hints.<br />Only dislike- on the screen the tiles are pretty small on my Kindle Fire for the larger designs and it would be nice if after removing pieces that remaining design would become larger to fill the entire screen. (another Mahjong version I have does this which is really nice)
0767803434|5.0|Lots of action, thrills and suspense to keep you on the edge of your seat. Harrison Ford is great again, a wonderful movie I will recomend to those who are Ford fans.

B00ABGEFWC|3.0|Just found out that you can access Facebook from this app even though I have my kids signed in to FreeTime with a code to prevent accidental purchases.  It's under invite friends.  One little click and you're in.  Didn't like that my contacts could be accessed by my kids.  You do have a warning come up at the start of the app accepting all their terms etc.  Again i was able to click thru with no code.  Concerns me because my 6 year old doesn't read well enough to understand what she's agreeing to. She just wants to get to playing the game.  Parents beware.
B009AMANBA|4.0|I liked the movie. I'm a fan of Daniel Day-Lewis and Sally Field. They were great together in this. I'm not sure it was the best picture of the year but I enjoyed it very much.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|love it  love it love it  play it all the time  can not  wait for next album !  It is on my I-pod
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|What a seemly true documentary of the group. I think was a story well worth telling and as a fan I love the Eagles even more. Love the 3rd DVD of the concert too. It wasn't long enough LOL!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This was a book club read for me.  I thought that the book was well<br />written, and fast passed.  As a person who enjoys mysteries and who don its<br />(outside of my book club reading) It kept me guessing until the end.<br /><br />A good read.
B005721Y7Y|5.0|I Had some trouble getting it to let me watch it when i switched from my lap top to my tv because it thought i waS streaming it on more that one device but other that that It was and awesome movie
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book was great! I love any book that holds my attention and keeps me coming back for more. I coukdnt wait to see what was going to happen next!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Truly a page turner!!  This book took me about 1 chapter to get interested.  But it quickly kept me wondering from page to page what was about to happen!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Except for the annoying ads that pop up every game it's a pretty good app, it keeps me entertained for a while and it's free so really no complaints here.
B005K17RU0|2.0|The old version was much more user friendly. The update is very unorganized. One thing neither version had was the chance of precipitation.
0425252868|5.0|A Higher Calling answers the question about can there be good men on both sides of a war.  This story follows a good Methodist farm boy, Charlie, later B17 pilot, and a good Catholic country boy, Franz, who becomes an ace German (not Nazi) fighter pilot.<br /><br />Eventually they meet over Germany, Charlie doing his best to destroy the Nazi war machine (and killing Franz's countrymen in the process), and Franz with his seventh ME109 gassed up and fully armed, trying to prevent Charlie from doing so.<br /><br />What happens next is the crucial center of this true story, and I'm not going to give it away. However, this event results in a search, some 50 years later, as both pilots seek each other out, and finally come together in a rich and warm `reunion'.<br /><br />This is one book I didn't want to put down! Added bonus, the info about the author, Adam Makos, is inspiring and heart-warming too.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a very entertaining app I sit up for hours playing it which isn't typical for me. I usually read or study but I find myself always going back to this app in my spare time.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Great free game to download , the graphics are the best. I have been very satisfied with everything and all the content
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Loved this book so much - did not want it to end.<br />Such a powerful reminder of events of WW II - I was just<br />a little girl at that time and I cannot wait for the 3rd book.<br />Follett is a wonderful researcher and story teller.  May<br />be my favorite of all time.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This program gives me weather information if I am traveling, or want to know what to expect for the day' activities. It meets my needs.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I realy love this Les Miserables!!<br />Its great but It is thik book for me in fact!<br />Hahaha.<br />I recommend you!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I wanted a solitaire game for air travel. It meets my need. This thing requires 8 more words. These are them!
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|It's true that the gameplay gets too complex too quickly. Well, chalk it up to the &#34;challenge&#34; factor. Well done and enjoyable nonetheless...
B009R659L8|4.0|Reaching into her bag of possible plots, Clark has managed to piece together an interesting story about family treachery. The story moved ahead with enough action to make the reader want to reach the conclusion of this whodunit. However, throughout the book there was no part where I was hesitant to stop reading. The characters were stiff and even the love interests seemed sterile and too easily set up. I gave this book four stars out of respect for Clark who did seem to want to please the reader with a happy ending.
B008JFLWLE|5.0|Coolest calculator ever!!! Never had a problem with it highly recommend even to just check it out. Can do some cool math.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is the best app ever it is awesome and I cant wait to see next months place or theme or l don't know I love this.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I really enjoy these puzzles. I did have a problem in the past where purchased puzzle packs disappeared, (I deleted apt after that) but now I`m trying again, but only with the free packs!
B003HGKJH8|3.0|In 2010, the album INNERSPEAKER by the hitherto unknown Australian act Tame Impala delighted indie rock critics. Essentially a one-man band, nearly all parts on the album were recorded by Kevin Parker in a beachfront house near Perth. Parker's obvious model is rock music of the late 1960s. There is psychedelic production, an early electric guitar tone, and a vague hommage to John Lennon in the vocals.<br /><br />The drumming outshines acts from that era. It wasn't until the 1970s that flashy rock drumming really took off, and what was virtuosic in the 1960s like Ginger Baker sounds commonplace to rock listeners today. In that sense, INNERSPEAKER sounds like the music we could have had then but didn't. And Parker has a definite talent with songwriting. Tracks like \\"Desire Be Desire Go\\", \\"Lucidity\\", \\"Solitude is Bliss\\" are simple enough to be instantly catchy, but deep enough to not sound like bubblegum pop. INNERSPEAKER stayed in my daily rotation for several weeks.<br /><br />But ultimately I have two major reservations about this album. The first is that unlike classic rock albums, where the sound can breathe, INNERSPEAKER is a \\"loudness wars\\" disaster where everything is packed into a tiny dynamic range. If I queue this in my home media centre after, say, a Cream album, I have to frantically reach out for the remote to avoid angering neighbours. My second source of unease with INNERSPEAKER is one common to many of the recent albums looking back at psychedelia: the 1960s sound is a bit too recherch&eacute;. The artist has not had access to the same drug experiences, nor is a product of the same society.<br /><br />Thus in spite of the catchiness of Tame Impala's music, the strong points are balanced by a sense of disappointment.
B00AAQWMB4|3.0|It was fun to play, but I couldn't figure out how to set the number of players against the computer. It looked like the only options were you against 3 computer components or all 4 liv  players.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Tim Ferris knocked the ball out of the park again! Like Tim's first book, The 4-Hour Chef is both entertaining and informative.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was immensely enjoyable!  The level of imagination and creativity is wickedly cunning and somewhat eerily inspiring! Thank you Suzanne Collins for the wonderful read.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Humorous, excellent story line and almost believeable. I love sci-fi but so much of it lately is just to unbelieveable high tech language, technology and events.
B004T5R2HQ|1.0|I did not like it.  Hard to use. The tutorial was not helpful. I need something that is a little easier to use.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|I like the game but it freezes a lot. Its cool to be able to use all the armors and to fly around and shoot. Just need to fix the freezing problem.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Game offers fun at your own pace, no need to buy anything. You cAn explore and move around and come back later.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a very good game I am the best though but if you buy it it will be a fun game for you and for everybody
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Love this show, it's very addictive, keeps you wanting more, I just started watching the series, I'm on episode 19 of season 2 and I think it's a great show, can't wait to catch up on the other episodes
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|It seems they have dragged out the story far to much and filled it with too many little details. I found myself almost wishing it would end soon and that was early on in the film.
B006QLH7O4|5.0|this is a good movie i love it better with the 3d graphics i had mine stolen or lost in my home so i will now need to replace it
B005LAIHXQ|2.0|Other than special effects there is nothing in this film that is of any interest. The story line is bad, too many changes to the alien creatures that now look bland when compared to the other 4 films. I would not waste my money on this DVD get something else.
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|We really enjoy Volbeat... They have great lyrics and their music is versatile. Good stuff all the way around. Fabulous sound for every occasion
B0027MJU00|5.0|Thriller and a little dark. Kept me guessing who the whole book. Can't wait to read another Gillian Flynn novel.
B004LROUNG|5.0|A very good cast of characters.  They were very true to life.  Interesting  look into the world of litigation and &#34;torts&#34;
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I love it!  The touch screen makes it more fun than playing with a mouse.  Great job on this one!!
B00821PCJS|5.0|Probably one of the best sci-fi series in the last several years. Excellent story line. If you have not seen this yet then you are in for a real treat.
B0097EWK3A|1.0|I was disappointed bc after just a few screens it comes up that you have to purchase the full edition!
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|We rented this for family movie night and we all loved it.  Our kids were introduced to many of the video game characters from my childhood (including Q-bert!).  It's a great animated film.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great for Times when your bored or want to be cheered up. I recommend you get the game!!!
B000I9U75G|3.0|I wanted to watch this movie out of nostalgia. I found it so long. It's not a great story or great acting, but it can fill time if you're really bored.
B001NP8PQW|2.0|All the famous songs are missing, although the quality of image and sounds are great, the missing songs make this Blue Ray not worthing.
B00CM6ZLG8|5.0|By far her best album. All the songs are amazing, open, real and heart felt. Her voice is mature and you can tell how much she's grown and how far she's come. I love this album and I love Demi :)
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Good history lesson.  Teaches luncacy of war, and even more importantly, teaches the critical importance of justice in the aftermath of war.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Rough season in their relationship, but the end of the season brought them full circle.  Loved the last episode and the richness of where it can go in Season 9.  Lots of funny episodes this season and those with Charlie/Felicia Day are the best.  But where was Garth?  Also, bringing back the character Krissy was awesome.  I hope to see more of all these characters - and Bobby in Season 9.  The Brothers need their extended family to really make the show work.  This was the roughest season yet, and I wasn't sure it would be worth it, but the later half of the season pulled it together.  The last few shows, specifically with Dean and Sam's relationship repairing were perfect.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I can't pin point my problem with the book but it was lacking something the other books had. Slightly disappointed.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Bought it because of hearing about it occasionally and how people liked playing it. Bought the standard game and a few months later bought the expansion pack for 2 more players. Great fun game! Changes every time and the wheeling and dealing is fun.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|We watch it all the time. The entire family has fun watching it. My son read all the books, and now he has the entire dvd collection.
B004SCN2F6|5.0|Owned this game since release. Easy but deep gameplay with a simple interface makes this a must for any mobile device. Fans of sci fi RPGs will appreciate the numerous options for your character and a large open-ended game world provides excellent replayability. Developers are always updating and improving this game so for a mobile gamer's investment, it can't be beat.
B009R659L8|5.0|Great Book....could not put it down!! You can never guess the ending until the last page.....She is the master of suspence!
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|It isn't often that I see a film more than once in the theatre, but for Cloud Atlas I made an exception. I just watched it for the third time, this time on Blu-ray at home, and it keeps getting better with each viewing.<br /><br />The most memorable scenes have ALL the following components working in perfect unison: a powerful image (visually stunning), enchanting music, poetic dialogue, and thoughtful acting (especially Ben Whishaw!). Most films are lucky to get one piece right in one or two scenes, which is why Cloud Atlas is special.<br /><br />This film, just like an important book, benefits from a second engagement. I do hope that more people give it a chance.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I love the train noise.  I fall asleep faster than ever with it on. It is totally calming.  The app works great.  It goes off exactly when it should and fades nicely.  I have no issues with it draining the battery.  It is usually plugged in at night anyway and the screen is off.  This is absolutely one of my favorite apps.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|This game presents a level of challenge beyond 100 floors escape. Onlt disappointment was limited to 10 floors but what do you expect for free. Fun while it lasted.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|This is a very intriguing book.  I couldn't  wait to keep reading to find out what happens next.  There are so many mysteries and secrets waiting to be discovered.  It is worth buying and makes me want to find more from this author.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|this game is very fun but it is super buggy on my kindle fire.  I've had to uninstall and reinstall several times because it won't sync with my facebook account.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I could not put this book down!  Page after page was like becoming an addict over time - you keep thinking you're only going to read a little then you just can't get enough. I'm excited to read some of the authors' other books but I DO wish this book had a sequel.  Trust me, you will too!
B00CATSONE|4.0|Interesting background on Tesla.  I would have enjoyed more on his relationship with JP Morgan. But I would recommend reading this and gain a new insight on creativity.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I really like this game a lot. A few kinks every once in a while. It's free which makes even better.
B000TO0TCQ|5.0|GREAT WORK I LOVED IT! ONE OF THE BEST!! Definitely worth getting. Needle needle hi brotherly hi betrothed needle mincemeat
0525478817|3.0|The Fault In Our Stars by John Green was a book that had been highly recommended and praised by friends, adults, and strangers (thanks Time!). However as soon as I completed reading the book within a mere day, I found myself torn between somewhat satisfied and deeply disappointed.<br /><br />The plot resembled that of a modern Romeo and Juliet, but in Green's world, thankfully, both lovers do not commit suicide over each other. Rather, he presents a Hemingway alternative, and allows nature - the big C in this case, to essentially rob Augustus (Romeo) from Hazel Grace (Juliet). Green does an impeccable job in hiding such twist prior to the climax by characterizing Hazel Grace as the depressed, 16 year old cancer patient only living day to day for her parent's sake. And like many other disappointingly fairytales, here comes Augustus, her knight in shining armor, to save her from the depths of apathy and to explore the world, or the little part of Indianapolis and to a certain extent, Amsterdam, together - borderline fantasy. While I experienced a broad spectrum of emotions, from crying to laughing, I was highly irritated by the obvious, overwhelming amount of foreshadowing chapter after chapter that indicated the death of Augustus - the climax. I was totally expecting it and thus, failed to sob as hard as I imagined when the time came.<br /><br />In contrast, I commend Green for demonstrating romance without the ick and goo so prevalent in young couples and thus, not solely focusing on the power of love so prevalent in romance novels. Rather it resonated the simple fact that life goes beyond infatuation and love; it emphasizes living and its expiration date (\\"Nothing Gold Can Stay\\"). It was easy to find myself connecting to the intimate conversations between the couple, whether the sarcastic, witty comments, or their mature outlook on existence and survival.<br />Overall, it was a semi-memorable book worth reading; however, for those looking for greater depth and meaning, do not expect if to be a favorite.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game Subway Surfers is a game you need to try and you will like it but if you do not you must be seriously sick.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Best movie I have seen in a very long time. I loved every second of it. And Bradley Cooper ain't too bad to look at either
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is just like temple run . It is fun four awhile but gets boring. It is addicting though and makes you want to play over and over again again.
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|She is a great artist. The songs on this CD are wonderful and something different that songs you hear everyday.
B004LWZW88|5.0|Delivery was fast and in great condition. It was as if I had purchased it right out of the store. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone. My 10 month old twin boys love this movie and cannot stop watching it!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was a great book from start to finish leaving me wanting the answers.<br />I give it a five out of five.
B008CLI4N4|4.0|Good acting, interesting story lines, not enough monsters, great production values. Problematic that HBO chooses an even more reductive view of female characters; many that are autonomous in the books are not here. I get that women's roles in the Middle Ages weren't terribly varied and didn't allow much variation. Some of the roles in the show, however, have taken complex female characters and actively reduced them to stereotypes where that isn't necessary to drive plot or condense character. Sad that HBO feels it needs to do this.
B0043JDUNS|4.0|#1 was better. This one isn't so bad as sequels go, and it was entertaining. It's worth $2.99 to rent
B009NY43NY|4.0|So basically I read the awful reviews before I read the book. I was expecting the worst book ever but did not get that. I was surprised at several of the scenes and not surprised at the ending.
B00AAQWMB4|4.0|This game provided me with something that has been lacking from all the other Android games I've played - FUN!<br />The concept behind this game is not original, but the developer executed it with skill. I appreciate the scant permissions, such as no need for network access. The download size is so small that I could not believe the install finished so quickly.<br />The gameplay mechanics are good. Dragging and dropping the blocks is accurate, rotating and flipping them is simple. This is definitely a 5 star app if the following improvements could be made.<br /><br />1. Intuitive controls - blocks should be able to be rotated with two fingers instead of using handles. A swipe should reflect the block in the respective direction.<br />Adding gesture controls will make this game much more polished and professional.<br />2. Higher res graphics - The blocks are ugly. They look like circles at times because of the way the gradient is applied. The hint dots could be more pronounced. The check, x, and menu buttons are low res and look like they were taken from Microsoft clip art.<br />3. Faster AI - On Levels 3 and 4, it can take the AI a minute to finish its turn later in the game. The loading animation could be more refined. However, I appreciate that the player can use his/her blocks during the AI's turn.<br />4. More Levels - It took me 4 rounds to beat Level 1 and 2 rounds to beat Level 2. Level 3 and 4 I managed to beat in 1 go. Please add more levels and harder ones as well.<br /><br />I hope these suggestions are incorporated. This is a game I will be keeping on my phone and this review will be updated accordingly.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I never read the books and knew nothing about the stori or the plot... I watched out of curiosity and was pleasantly surprised. The story is a bit dark and there are a few scenes that are brutal, but overall it's a thrilling movie. The end is a bit weak and there are a couple of other scenes that are weak as well, but I'd still recommend it.
B0014J8D9Q|5.0|Well done; have watched it several times over the years. Have not got tired of it yet. Good entertaiment and could provoke some thought about how &#34;we all got it comin kid.&#34;
B001DM1VXE|1.0|This film is like watching a freshman film students first movie. It tries to be deep and profound butnitsmlaughable and the acting is awful. Don't waste your time.
B00CKQ1092|5.0|In the lyric video for \\"Prancer\\" there's a explanation of the term swan song, if this is The Dillinger Escape Plan's way of stating that \\"One of us is the Killer\\" is to be their final album, them so be it. I couldn't think of a more fitting end for a band, not only does the album surpass most of their prior works, it also tips its hat to them.  \\"CH 375 268 277 ARS\\" is clearly a nod to \\"Calculating Infinity\\" while songs like \\"Paranoid Shields\\" hearken back to \\"Irony is a Dead Scene\\". This album is an amalgam of what make's them so special. It's creepy, violent, erratic, and brutal. It's unmistakably The Dillinger Escape Plan. For those of us who have grown to love them, I hope this is not their last venture, but if it is, It's one hell of a finale.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|If you like his books, you will like this one too.  He's always easy to read and very engaging.  This one won't disappoint!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Never watched on TV love the show it keeps you on your toes and Julie margolas is a great actor
B0064MGU98|5.0|I had heard many people remark about how this was their favorite program, but for some unknown reason,<br />I never made an effort to watch an episode. That was just the first year. Then, in the ensuing two years I felt<br />that I didn't want to play &#34;catch up&#34;  so again ignored my friends' comments about what a fine program &#34;The Good<br />Wife&#34; was and how much I was missing. Then when I saw it listed as available to watch on Instant Video, I decided<br />to try it out from the beginning and was more than pleasantly surprised with the results....I am now hooked and only<br />wish I were able to watch ALL of the episodes back to back until I'm current with the latest shows. Love the series<br />and hope it doesn't end for many years!
B006M4F67A|5.0|I find the game addicting, have to limit my playing time or I get nothing else done, not even a book read.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I gave it a 4 rating because I thoroughly this book and look forward to reading his next book The Hit!
B00BJA2VFW|1.0|boring and ended to fast just a waste of money. If i could erasers off kindle i would booooooooo booooo
B001K3EXTA|5.0|I had forgotten how handsome Robert Redford was... I totally enjoyed the movie...loved the music...acting...and the automobiles...I will watch again!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|The game is an awesome game of dodging, shooting, upgrading, and much more. Highly recommended to fans of the Subway Surfer or Temple Run series!
B00CL68NOG|5.0|Didn't think it was going to be this nuanced...with some big laughs as well.  I would easily recommend this for somebody lookinjg for a well crafted comedy.
B005RYF5JA|5.0|I HAVE PURCHASED 5 DIFFERENT CELTIC WOMAN DVDs AND I RATE THIS ONE THE BEST!  #2 IS A CHRISTMAS DVD.  #3 IS THEIR SHOW PERFORMED AT AN OLD IRISH CASTLE.  IF YOU LIKE IRISH MUSIC THEN YOU MUST HEAR THESE YOUNG IRISH WOMEN.....THATS STRAIGHT FROM A PATRICK O'RIELLY!!!!!  REGARDS
B005CW5E3O|5.0|Been waiting a long time for a new album from guitar great Johnny Winter. Roots was worth the wait!! Roots has a great  list of songs that Johnny grew up playing. There are some great guest players on board , From Sonny Landreth on T- bone Shuffle to Vince Gill on Maybellene, Warren Haynes,Derek Trucks,Susan Tedeschi,Edgar Winter an John Popper an more. This is a great album!!!
B005PK57IK|5.0|I choose 5 stars because the story line and the characters draw you in,<br />I'm sorry I hadn't watched it sooner, but it was fun watching it episode after episode following the story development.<br />And who doesn't love watching it without commercials!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is a fun game for an old geezer.  most of the flows are not real challenging and then I run into one that I think &quot;you can't do it&quot; then after awhile I do get it.  you need a good frame of mind for some.  I also Think about these beforehand and try to get &quot;perfect.&quot;
B00821PCJS|5.0|My goddaughter told me that I had to watch this. I wasn't expecting much from it but, man, was I wrong. It grabbed me from the opening scene and didn't let go. I think the fact that there are only 10 episodes worked in its favor because there was no time for the story to slow down or get stagnant. The cliffhanger ending has me anxious to start season 2, which I will be doing tonight.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I really enjoyed the story and the characters. However, at times Travis feelings for Abby seemed more like dependence than love.
B003IDMUT0|5.0|Another first class novel by John Grisham. The story is very well researched, logical and competently  presented - classic Grisham. The novel moves at a fast pace leaving the reader anxiously awaiting the next page. The setting moves from the legal jungle of the USA to the raw jungle of Brazil; the characters varying  from avaricious, through zealotry to a primitive indian tribal community. The story ending is logical, unexpected and moving. An excellent read.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|What more is there to say.  It's a good show. And it doesn't have ridiculous scant clothes. It's respectable and not crude like every other show with the amount of sensuality.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft pocket edition is super fun. I personally think it is easier for non experienced players that don't know the recipes to make things like myself. The only downsides to Pocket edition is that it doesn't have all the features, missing some items, and there is no multiplayer servers (yet). All this game needs is a couple updates and it's perfect. I was also able to get the game free when it was $4 and Amazon gave everybody the 500 Amazon coins.
B007SGM084|5.0|Just finished the FSOG trilogy and it has eaten up my May...<br /><br />Don't get me wrong I will forever love FSOG and it is my first , yes first, book love.<br />One thing I have come to realize is the same book from the other POV is ....not for me. The epilogue is FSOG is all I need. I don' want a CG POV of the entire trilogy or any other books I have read. I know I am in the minority but it almost feels like &#34;filler&#34;. If the story is moving forward like The Opportunist, Dirty Red, I am all for it. Just , kind of boring..IMO. This should save me some time and money.<br /><br />OK I digress...but re reads not my thing either with one exception eeek Thoughtless and Effortless. Maybe because there was so much emotion and so much happening in that series but I will probably not re read a book or series again. FSOG not as exciting as the first time, probably because so many alpha male stories have been released since then. Book 1 was worth the re read, some of book two , and the epilogue of book 3 with CG POV. I still love the books and they are still my favorite but there are so many alpha male books to feed that addiction, no they are not CG but they minimally satisfy the need. The characters since Fifty just can't replicate, they fall short and do not have the depth of CG. This series is my first book love and will never be replaced, no NEVER EVER EVER. So for now I close my final chapter of FSOG with a bittersweet satisfied fulfilled heart. I will forever miss my CG and FSOG and will forever be grateful of the day I found this loving story.<br /><br />Thank you E.L James for writing a &#34;different&#34; book that made me realize my love for reading and the Alpha male. Reading bored me and besides the occasional popular book I just never enjoyed it. I am not a wayward reading fan and my life, along with many others, has forever changed because of your fan fiction story. Reading has become a passion for me and a place for me to unwind and re energize after a long day of monotonous work. Critics can say what the will but what you alone did for reading, Goodreads, and Contemporary romance will never be duplicated. Notice I use Contemporary Romance and NOT Erotica or BDSM. Since Fifty I have read some Erotica and BDSM and Fifty does not belong in either category. Yes it hints at it and yes the sex scenes are explicit (THANK GOD!) but it is a story about two consenting adults in the privacy of their own bedroom (or playroom,elevator, piano, boat, plane). There is shock and awe in book one for those of us who knew nothing about non vanilla sex. The non vanilla sex borders on erotica but BDSM...hardly.

I will forever be grateful for FSOG.a long day of monotonous work. Critics can say what the will but what you alone did for reading, Goodreads, and Contemporary romance will never be duplicated. Notice I use Contemporary Romance and NOT Erotica or BDSM. Since Fifty I have read some Erotica and BDSM and Fifty does not belong in either category. Yes it hints at it and yes the sex scenes are explicit (THANK GOD!) but it is a story about two consenting adults in the privacy of their own bedroom (or playroom,elevator, piano, boat, plane). There is shock and awe in book one for those of us who knew nothing about non vanilla sex. The non vanilla sex borders on erotica but BDSM...hardly.

B0063M22QO|4.0|I really enjoyed the color of the tiles and the different  shapes of the game; such as the wave etc.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|After the events in The Avengers it's a more uncertain and weakened Tony Stark that we see in Iron Man 3.  The arrogance is still there but it's tempered with fear of the future and what the great unknown might bring back to Earth.  His fear of keeping his lady love Pepper Potts safe has him up nights making The Suit even better.  Needless to say, sleepless nights equals a Tony showing some serious moments of anxiety which make him all the more human and demonstrates that he IS NOT Iron Man, at least not entirely.<br /><br />After its explosive opening salvo we're given a flashback montage of Tony's earlier wilder days (with a recognizable face or two that made me go aaawwwwwww) and his knowledge of some important medical research which brings us back to the now and a madman named The Mandarin, who's holding the world hostage through random bombings and overall fear.  His actions are a smokescreen to something even bigger and it's up to Tony to figure out what it is.  With The Suit out of the picture for a period of time Tony must rely on his mind and the creativeness that made him a millionaire.  Being stuck in small town America he enlists the help of a young boy named Harley, who he sees a lot of himself in, and together they gain even more vital information into the military's part in the bombings and who's really behind it all. The interactions between these two was delightfully playful and had me thinking how great a father Tony would be.  I'm usually annoyed by children but found him an admirable sidekick.<br /><br />In the previous movies, Pepper was the damsel in distress, but I'm happy to report she kicked some serious butt in this movie.  I liked seeing the duality of businesswoman Pepper and the woman who saves Tony.  There's a newfound respect from her in regards to the necessity of putting your life on the line and I think it brings them closer together.  After an uneasy transition to Don Cheadle portraying Rhodes in the previous film, I found him to be much more comfortable in the part.  He and Tony had enjoyable verbal bantering and he had a more commanding presence in the War Machine armor.<br /><br />The Mandarin seems a formidable villain and, played by Ben Kingsley, he brings unexpected humor to his villainous persona.  As the movie progresses though we find out that there's a bigger, more scarier, player behind the scenes.  He's using medical technology to change people and make them invincible and he's a worthy opponent in a battle against Iron Man.  This final battle unleashes some very intense special effects.  It's like 4th of July has been unleashed on the screen and it only gets more exciting as a surprising army comes to aid Tony in his fight to save Pepper, the President, and the world.<br /><br />After a disappointing second movie, I found this one a return to form. The humor was back, the villain was a worthy adversary who had a cleverly nefarious plan, and Tony again showed emotional character growth.  He was brought low in this movie and rose heroically from the ashes.  I see that for true comic book afficonados this movie was a disappointment, but as a person unfamiliar with the comic book origins I found this an intriguing twisting and turning story with delightful verbal sparring and edge of your seat action.  The acting was well-done all around with a special shout out to Ben Kingsley who really isn't what you expect him to be.  Guy Pearce, who plays Killian, also shows a dramatically different side as he starts the film in full geek mode and transforms into cover model handsome while showing a deceptively malicious side.  The returning main couple of Gwyneth Paltrow and Robert Downey Jr. have their characters down pat.  There's a connection between the two that can't be broken no matter what befalls them.  With Tony making a surprising choice at the end it will be interesting to see where he and Iron Man go next.  As usual with Marvel movies, make sure to stay until after the credits for ahilarious scene between Tony and Dr. David Banner!hilarious scene between Tony and Dr. David Banner!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Though I've read many books of this type, it was more convincing than others that an afterlife does exist, only by the obvious distinction that the author was a neurosurgeon and essentially had no brain waves in his coma-state.  I liked how the book was laid out - he would go from his experience, then back to what his family was experiencing - very nicely written.  My only disappointment came from the fact that he did not fully explain his experience in the book.  I realize, however, that much of the memories come back through time and thought and perhaps Eben Alexander will be writing another book in the future covering more of his experience while on the other side.<br />Sig
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Star Trek: Into Darkness is a more than worthy successor to the 2009 JJ Abrams reboot with its exciting and heart-pounding storyline, eye-popping special effects, much-welcomed humor, and a jelling of the characters.  Using source material from earlier Trek movies, this installment ends up being a Trek fan's delight as they pick out well-known quotes, new yet familiar characters, and in an ultimate nod to sci-fi geeks everywhere......borrowing an actor from the Doctor Who universe for a pivotal opening role.<br /><br />Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) is still trying to fit the mold of what other's think makes a good Captain and struggling mightily.  When the chips are down and he's thrust into doing what others can't do is when his true understanding of what a Captain must do becomes clear in a few unexpectedly emotional scenes.  Emotional scenes show up at the most unexpected times in fact as Spock (Zachary Quinto) struggles with his human side in his dealings of friendship with Kirk and his continuing romance with Uhura (Zoe Saldana).  Quinto is quickly making the role his own as he seamlessly blends his Vulcan logic with the human emotions of fear, anger, and love and had me focusing on him every time he came on screen.  Scotty (Simon Pegg) too left his mark in this film through some perfectly timed humor and subtle way of reminding everyone the true vision of Star Trek is to explore.  Talk and acts of war put a modern spin on the tale and creates extra tension and philosophical issues to ponder long after the movie is over.<br /><br />Benedict Cumberbatch makes for a compelling villain, at once violent and untrustworthy and yet sympathetic too.  His real identity isn't revealed until the latter part of the movie but true Trek fans have known all along who he was.  He and Kirk make a formidable team when forced into working together and even scarier enemies when staring each other down.  His storyline is wrapped up but definitely leaves room for a return appearance.  Female moviegoers hoping for some kick ass heroines will be somewhat satisfied as Uhura gets to be more than Spock's girlfriend in this film showing a few fight skills of her own.  I wish the other new female character of Carol Marcus (who Trek fans know from the mythology) had fared as well.  She's a runaway daughter who tries to use tears to end a battle when not coyly flirting with Kirk.  I both dread seeing her again but know it's inevitable so I hope for someone much stronger next time around.<br /><br />JJ Abrams' script had one or two obvious moments, but on a whole kept me on the edge of my seat.  The special effects were truly impressive and weren't done merely for show.  The cast/crew really meshed in this movie as you could sense their closeness, their sense of friends and family.  The dialogue was fast-paced with flashes of humor and intense emotions and I would love to see this film again as I feel I might have missed some of the nuances keeping up with the dialogue. Abrams has created another loving tribute to the Star Trek universe and we fans are the ones being rewarded in this immensely satisfying, sure to be a summer blockbuster, film.emale moviegoers hoping for some kick ass heroines will be somewhat satisfied as Uhura gets to be more than Spock's girlfriend in this film showing a few fight skills of her own.

B006TTC590|5.0|I love this movie and especially the version I got! It came in a perfect amount of time and was exactly what was advertised!
B009K0P10K|5.0|Midway I was getting a little bored but it really picked up towards the end. All in all this is a first rate series.  Aiden doesn't really do anything for me and Emily (Amanda) really deserves better.  She is SO good!!!
B001NOQI3U|5.0|One of my alltime favorite movies. This is the best role she played, and she also directed this movie. This move is a classic.
B009NY43NY|1.0|Disappointed is the most mild way I can describe my feelings. I was so entranced with the series ... What a let down. Though by book11 I was already a bit disheartened by events and thoroughly displeased I still held out hope for a &#34;perfect ending&#34; this was certainly not what I had in mind. I still love the series as a whole but am utterly stricken with sadness at the conclusion.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|DON'T BUY okay !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /> Not nice okay don't buy I hate 'repeat I hate INTERNET dicsniary don't use<br /> On the right thing for a long way to make yourself in a lot more information
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Have become interested in WWII movies...found this book choice interesting from the &#34;German&#34; viewpoint while integrating the American entrance into the war. The author is so precise in writing his &#34;historical&#34; facts (because it is a biography of an American and a German documented by records and interviews) which one does not encounter while watching a movie.  I have always wondered &#34;why&#34; the jews never fought back and the Germans never said &#34;no to the SS and Gestopo&#34;.....this book answers most of my questions about the &#34;whys&#34;.  Very sad history.  Read somewhere that over 60,000  books have been written about WWII and the US government has over 14 million tons of paper with records for WWII.  AWESome.
B005MMYBXI|5.0|This series was addictive. Great characters and actors. I'm sad to see it end but glad to be able to see it again and again on dvd!
B000SNW0HA|5.0|This album still pumps in my speakers today.  I first got it in like 10th grade and wow.. These guys are wizards!!
B00CDCIQX6|1.0|The trailer was intriguing.  The idea was good. But...once the movie starts to get interesting they throw in the gay lovers. Gag. Has all the progressive new world order morality propaganda.  Yeah slavery is bad. But.....  had to delete it.  Waste of money.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|just need to change a couple of things. but i like the game  looking forward for more of these games :)
B00COGYUAE|4.0|My son loves it the movie and like the animation.<br /> Runs just the right amount the time.<br /> We will purchase the next movie.
B00BT0ZDF2|4.0|This is an aswesome movie if you have several hours to kill. You must be able to pay attention so make sure there are no distraction when you sit down. I had to watch it several times due to the fact that I have small children that make lots of noise running around my house. The cast is epic and the way the stories work together will blow your mind!
B009IUH1N2|2.0|I got this as the faotd a while ago and got bored with it pretty quickly, but the graphics and audio were well done so I chose to hold off on a final decision.  I've picked it up a couple times since and come away with the same impression, that the audio is fine and visually it's pretty good but the game just isn't much fun, and the only challenge  is memorizing the levels.  Definitely worth the price I paid, not sure if it a worth a buck unless you want to support the devs.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Often science fiction uses some type of gimmick to hold the story together, here it is the Silos. The thing is it really works in Wool. Without the silos there is no story but with them a whole new framework emerges for a truly engaging tale.
0061120073|3.0|An excellent book about growing up poor in the early 20th century. Amazon advertised this book as as \\"Large Print\\". It is not. It is not even a bold print. This is my second disappointment by Amazon in a year.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Surprising, interesting, gripping! I was pleasantly surprised by how engrossed in this book I became. The photos added a level of connection to the characters and the story that was wonderful. Great read!
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I read this book because I loved the movie. The movie was better. The book was rather boring and sounded like it was written by a 5 year old.
0962477060|5.0|if your just learning how to play the guitar or been playing for years its still an amazing instructional book. i always wanted to understand the function and design of the fretboard? why did they design the guitar in this fashion?  this book explains it well enough for even a dummy like me to understand. well worth every penny
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book and would recommend it to anyone who wanted to read something strangely uplifting. Beautiful characters and a creative storyline.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|We watched this with my teenage daughter on this past Friday evening, who hadn't seen it, prior to seeing the new Star Trek - Into Darkness on early Saturday morning.  The young James Tiberius Kirk is perfectly cast with Chris Pine as the young Jim and Zachary Quinn as the young Spock.<br /><br />Plus the screenwriter's throw a slew of metaphors from Bones, just like the series.  When I saw the series as a young kid, these metaphors were a learning experience for mind, now they a just hilarious.<br /><br />So, if you're planning to see the new Star Trek movie and haven't seen this original in a while, by all means watch it before you see the new one...
B009R659L8|4.0|Enjoyed the book, not her best but still a thriller and easy to read.  Would recommend it to anyone who likes mysteries
B00061HJ4S|5.0|Just what I needed. perfect for  my collection. Tamiya has always been an excellent model maker! Just might order more
B005HCI72O|5.0|The story keeps evolving!  I love the historical details that are entwined in this unlikely but compelling saga.  Jamie and Claire are real, aren't they?
B000WN8AHA|5.0|just the thing you got to have if you want to start your very own WWII collection. Gotta love halftracks
B004TMPJP6|5.0|I can use Wunderlist on all my devices and it syncs up across all of them. It makes my grocery list a breeze. Even my &#34;non-tech&#34; husband can add items to my grocery list.
B0064MGU98|4.0|Well-acted, well-presented, timely series. Margulies does an excellent job of going from the situation  of a power position to the junior associate wanne-be. Believable, human cast from grannie to kids, to associates in the firm. Investigator should get an Emmy. Never watched on network, but am now addicted.
B009R659L8|4.0|This was a very interesting book.  It was a quick read and it held your interest through out the book.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|Fun game. Keeps you on your toes the more you level up. Although I get confused with the pictures sometimes that's not a big deal. But could have just a bit more of items to buy or at least some more updates instead of the regular old ones.
B00AJAFNIA|5.0|This is a \\"stellar\\" game that is a lot of fun. I enjoy the originality of it's creators. Good game.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I think every book in this series got better and better. I felt such a part of this book. The writer nailed the emotions and wrote an excellent read.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|i also have this on my ps3 but when i'm on the go i have to play it on my kindle XD
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I really like the variety of different sounds this offers. It has some I never would of even thought to include!
B0063IH60K|4.0|If I had gotten this for me or my kids it would have been just fine no complaints but I got it for my grandmother so the pop ups confuse her she's in her 90's I will probably just buy 1 to avoid the popups. All in all works great and its free hello that's pretty good
B005CRQ2IU|5.0|I'll admit, I saw the movie before reading the comic.  I know, I know, blaspheme!  Nevertheless, when I saw this on sale for $3.99 on the kindle, I knew I had no more excuses for not picking it up.  Boy, am I glad I did.<br /><br />Let's talk about the art.  For a comic that came out in the 80s, the art, even today, is still amazing.  I don't know who penciled, inked, and/or colored, but that person(s) did a fantastic job.  The sheer amount of detail made me sit up and really pay attention to what I was looking at.  There is one part in particular that I especially loved: the comic that young Bernard reads shows panels that are &#34;dotted&#34; to indicate they are from Bernard's comic book, juxtaposed with the smoother colors of the Watchmen panels.  I loved all the multiple perspectives of the characters (from their eyes), I loved the carefully laid out newspapers whose headlines were visible enough to remind us that the political clock was ticking, I loved it, I loved it, I loved it.<br /><br />The story was similarly fantastic.  I was sucked into the world from the get-go, and did not put down the comic until the book was finished.  Again, it was the small things that really pulled everything together: pages from Holis' book, the specific way each character speaks (the way Rorschach's speech differs between past and present!), and so many other details that just boggles the mind.<br /><br />I'm happy to have finally read this, and highly recommend the kindle version if you have a tablet and/or have no problems reading on a computer.  The colors are vibrant and the level of detail in the artwork demands you actually look at the panels and not skim over them, something that requires a larger screen and/or zoom.  On an e-reader (such as the kindle or nook), I feel that you may be waiting too long for pages to load, not to mention spending too long expanding each panel, that it wouldn't really allow you to immerse yourself into the story.
B0037VNX44|4.0|This movie has a very cool style.  Tom Hardy is an amazing actor and I love the scene where he is on stage having a conversation with himself about his trial.  Great scene
B003VIWO9I|5.0|My positive opinion on Discworld books is most certainly biased, as I've been reading Pratchett since high school and still eagerly anticipate his next books, but regardless, I Shall Wear Midnight is definitely one of his better ones.<br /><br />Being the third book in his Tiffany Aching series, it was a real pleasure to watch this character grow and mature.<br /><br />What more is there to say?  If you enjoyed the other two, then you will like this one as well.
B004SIIBGU|3.0|Seller's ability to manage store functions is extremely limited.  Active listings cannot be organized by different options & sold items need to be viewable by awaiting shipment, sold & shipped, & listed by order not by item. Very confusing & unmanageable.
B007LGPSX0|5.0|Great show Just... Wished there were more seasons available to watch, I wonder if they will in the future?....pretty please
B00632HWOG|4.0|Direct access to yahoo mail as I set it up in unit setup had ceased to load New mail.  Is good to have it back on the Kindle.  Functions much like the laptop version now.
B00B2PHSIY|1.0|Only fits dive housing for Hero and Hero 2. Don't waste your time thinking it fits the new Hero 3
B004SZNLYK|5.0|This dvd came in perfect condition and timing. Plays perfect and I would recommend that others looking for the same product go with this.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|Good story.  Interesting characters.  Plot moves right along. Enjoy the egyptian mythology in a modern story.  Change of pace from the Heroes of Olympus series.
B00992CF6W|4.0|A great game, I love minecraft,but I wish the world was at least bigger. In survivalcraft the island is basically endless. Overall a great adjustment to minecraft.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|A  fitting final edition bringing together all of the key characters in an epic final battle that met my expectations.
B0006AAS5G|5.0|My Invicta was sent to me with in the time limit I requested and when it arrived all the paper work and the case was in perfect condition and needless to say my Invicta was absolutely flawless
0307887448|3.0|I really wanted to love this novel. I grew up in the late 80's and have some nostalgia about things, even though I wasn't old enough to really play video games until the early nineties. I loves some of the references to things I remembered such as the Intellivision system and movies and music, but about half-way into the novel I started to feel like all the references were really taking away from the story. I got impatient with the book, I wanted to know what happened to the protagonist, not a bunch of facts the 80's. The novel is set in the future in Ohio, in a semi-post-apocalyptic world and nothing really new or interesting jumped out at me. The detailed explanations about how MMORPGS worked (currently) was unnecessary, anyone who made it to that point in the book is probably familiar enough with it. I understand he was trying to include a broad audience though, so maybe some explanation is required, but it certainly left fewer things up to the imagination. So far the book has felt like an MTV pop-up video from the 80's, all the quirky facts are taking away from what the book is trying to convey and even the main story line is a bit transparent and lacking in substance.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I trully enjoy this game, its great fun .  I like games that challenge and also has some physics about it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The Hunger Games is worth reading a 2nd, a 3rd and a 4th time.  The movie is good but some great parts were changed and you need to read the books to get the maximum emotional impact!!
B008GXHOFW|4.0|I didn't have any problems getting the game to load like some others have. The overall gameplay is not bad but the free roam web-slinging is the best part.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I think that this game has a VARY good point because it cloud  rilly happen  in real life. their is a zoo a guy got a deal to sell the animals. he takes the animals. the other zoo keepers find out. they need to get new animals from the wild. and start a new zoo. I just LOVE the game.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|If you don't mind long books this one is worth the read and time. I love this author! :-) Enjoy
B009NY43NY|4.0|Fantastic series! May have needed more to the ending. Other than that awesome!! Thank you Charlaine Harris for bringing the world of Sookie Stackouse to us. I am from Shreveport and had the privilege of meeting Mrs. Harris. Reading a series and seeing actual places around Shreveport in the books was tons of fun :)
B001POX73C|5.0|Of all the books written by the incomparable Georgette Heyer, Cotillion is, in my opinion by far the best.  When Kitty's guardian decides that whichever of his nephews marries her will become his heir and calls them to his country house to give them the information, Kitty's favorite fails to show up.  Stung, she decides to go to London hoping to gain his attention, and to accomplish this, persuades one nephew, known as Foolish Freddy to join her in a pretend engagement to enable her to pursue her plan.  From there on, the characters move through London high society in a graceful and intricate plot reminiscent of the dance from which the book takes its title.  Eventually, not just one, but four couples pair off and Kitty learns to follow her heart.  For readers who appreciate good writing, this is a highly satisfying novel..
B007FEFLTO|4.0|the only failure of the book is the difficulty recalling the characters from the first of the trilogy. Looking forward to the third of the set.
0446547638|5.0|I love his books, I have them all but this one I must have lent it out because when I went t o find one it wasn't there, so I had to buy it again.
B0013F1D02|5.0|This story is outstanding and the movie is a fairy tale / fantasy for all ages.  I will enjoy this movie fir years to come.
B008NW67E0|5.0|I really enjoy their sound. All the songs are good which is a rare thing on most cds. I would definitely recommend this one to my friends.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I don't want to spoil the ending for those who haven't read this yet, so all I'll say is that the book ended the series well.  I enjoyed it a great deal
B005HEFB6M|3.0|This series, Enterprise, is a good  starting point to connect  the  trip of Cockraine  with  the  Start Trek'  seasons  of James T Kirk. It tells  the beginning when  Humanity  started  to  make  warp  trips.  However,  the  stories are sometimes  very week,  the  model used to represent  a captain  is similar to the captain  of a sea ship ( dog included) . So it makes  a little boring to see.  What is  nice to see is How  T.Popl , the vulcan  becomes  loyal to  captain Archer.<br />Technically, It is  nice  to see  how the  technology udes  was primitive and rude in comparison with  the technology in the other series  of  Star Trek.
B001JIHGO0|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite vampire flicks.  It's a little campy, but in all the right ways.  Love it!
B00BMCAM6M|5.0|Love this App.  I got it free and I just love being able to have different genres of music on my Kindle whenever I want to listen to it.  Highly recommend.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I find Connelly's books very entertaining and in particular I like the Harry Bosch novels.  This one is no exception. It is an entertaining read.  Connelly's work continues to maintain its high standards and his writing has not gotten stale as some authors works have.
B005C8ENI0|4.0|Good movie with decent acting and a reasonable plot.  Matthew McConaughey was actually very good as the lead in this movie.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|I heard about this series but do not get HBO.  It is addicting.  Really get attached to the characters and can't wait to see what will happen next.
B00992CF6W|3.0|This more of a tool wrapped in a game, recommend it to the builder who is in touch with the Lego loving child within.<br />Surely it can be enjoyed by the whole family, kids and adults alike.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|By now we are very involved in the series and the change of events that are very unpredictable.  Trying to figure out how they can go 5 seasons.
B008KMHFJY|4.0|Actually 4.5 stars, Great book just loved Walking disaster more. Any one with a bit of romance in their blood would love this
B00A81NFAS|5.0|I'm not the romance movie kind of guy, but I decided to buy this after seeing how much praise this movie received. And it starred the amazing Jennifer Lawrence which was a plus. There is not one thing I can think of that made me not enjoy the movie. It was very well directed and the acting was solid.
B00AO2P3GA|1.0|It made me download1125md when i first opened the game did that now it wont stay open. Im very mad and want to know how to get it to work
B008XG1X18|3.0|I LOVE pinterest but it wont run on my kindle! Can only go on it on my iphone and that's annoying! Was working fine at first but finally had to uninstall. PLEASE fix problem! Want it back on my kindle!!
B00AZL3PBK|2.0|I mean it is like the first one and exactly like mario. I really thinks its another one of those rip offs
B00BESM14U|4.0|I was especially happy to see that the author deleted the main character's obsession with Ayn Rand, which figured prominently at the end of the novel.  It was the only part of the book that I didn't like, so I was thrilled to see it is absent from the film.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|It is a fine game its just these games always freeze up my kindle or delete data before Im done
B00CL68QVQ|1.0|I didn't like &#34;Dirty Dancing&#34; then, and I don't like the new version of it now.  This movie stinks.  Blah.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I read all the books and the series definitly wented out with a bang ;) Get it if you have read the other series books
B00992CF6W|4.0|I have a 5 and 12 year old and they both love playing this.<br />Had to get it on my wife's kindle fire also.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|I wasnt a big fan of this game. I was good while it lasted but it kpt freezing up my kindle
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|This is fantastic . As always he gives us, his fans, the ultimate in JOY. This is like listening to his life in song. Happy, loving, and quite poignant at times. This is the first album of his own music in many years. Why did he wait so long we may ask. There is a time for everything and the title says it all. It would seem the time for this album is now.<br />Buy the CD you won't be disappointed.
B00BEPVAV8|2.0|I played it for a little bit. The checkpoints are really close together though. and my kindle is very sensitive
B0013TPV0Q|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read in a long time.  David Sedaris is so funny I had trouble putting the book down.  Every chapter was laugh out loud!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is the best game I have on my phone everyone should get this game even my mom likes this game
1400069742|4.0|My eyes were opened by this book, which illustrates how political gamemanship and back-stabbing is just how it's done.  Impressionsions of Roosevelt and Lindbergh are now much different then before I read this book.  It pulled me into the times and tribulations both men forged through to deal with a world of challengeing and changing times.  Lindburgh's wife was given her own fair due, and it was a real eye-opener to find out how her husband treated her and their children.
B000FVE3BG|4.0|This item did not look cheap at all~ but was bigger than described. I could wear it despite being a righty on either hand but it was larger than listed. The true measurement was a full 2 inches across the entire face.
B009NY43NY|1.0|What did I just read? Really Eric only made it into the book twice! Wow!!! Expected more to this great series not this bull of ending. sadly disappointing!!!! Really Sam? I keeped reading to see if Eric would pop out to save the day and nothing! What a waist of money and time!
B0038AUYB4|5.0|Nor yet art criticism, but that's there too.  When this first came out a bookshop offered the first chapter as a sample.  I read the first page, and went back in and bought the whole thing.  It remains one of the funniest things I've ever read, yet it's only the prelude to a wonderfully interlinked set of stories about the formation of history.  Still Barnes' best, though he keeps getting close to matching it.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I think this is one of the better G5 games. The balance between hidden object and puzzles is refreshing. Pretty challenging too! As with all of these games, however, I do wish it was longer. And I kind of beat the bad guy by accident. Still not sure how I did it.
B009NY43NY|1.0|Stupidest ending ever. No wonder the author apologized in the beginning... so disappointed in how she chose to end this. Refund please!
B00C1BUYX4|1.0|This was the most BORING two and a half hours I've had in a long time.<br />The title of this movie should have been The 13th Amendment and not Lincoln.<br />I was expecting a movie about the life of Lincoln, not a few weeks of his life preceding the vote.<br />Good sleeping pill!
B008Y5OWMK|5.0|One of my favorite period movies during an embarrassing part of the settling of the west.  Terrific cinematography, music, actors.  Yes, it's a long movie - just kick back and enjoy it.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|You Wont be disappointed- non stop action with witty writing.  If you like QT's other movies you'll love this one!
B0007VZ9DK|5.0|Having worked in a major casino, this movie is entertaining and educational.  What a time it was back in the day.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Really enjoyed it! Not your conventional love story, much deeper and realistic. Showed another side of life beyond love conquering all
B006M4F67A|5.0|I found 247 Mahjong to be an enjoyable game to play. It has good graphics, but I can't really comment on the audio track as I usually play with the audio muted.
B00A2LOAKI|4.0|When I think about every version of Batman I think about one thing.. A symbol. After watching I realized Batman is a crime fighter with no super powers and a crap load of money. I even liked the fact that the animators made Superman look like a girl LOL.  I liked the premise a lot, every different and unique take on my favorite character.
B00BOX0K0M|2.0|It would be great for boating not for surfing.<br /><br />Water gets all over the cover and makes a huge blur when surfing, much better off just dealing with the glare from a clear video....<br /><br />Also it came scratched and without any protective film over the lens, unlike the red filter for diving... Makes me wonder if I was shipped a used reject... I will try to buy it again for boating where it stays high and dry.<br /><br />This is the best option out there for filters with its snap in design and tethers though... They just need to work on their quality dept...
B008RV5K5E|4.0|A batman that is well into his fifties? I wasn't sure I would like this plot. I have been waiting on a Batman Beyond movie however nothing beats the original even if he is old. Good plot, great animation.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Very addicting and exciting game. You will enjoy it except it takes time to get used to the controls but one you master that you will have a good time playing it.
B007L5GDGW|4.0|I love this app. It was my first one I ever got on my kindle and it was fun! I was pleasantly surprised
B0087EACJK|4.0|Not bad-not bad at all- okay so the only problem is dat instructions can be a bit sketchy - but it's a decent puzzle game
B0065GC0BA|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a very long time. Lots of emotions in this one. Awesome!!
B008Y73940|5.0|Clever, witty , funny and action is a great combo when it falls in the realm of believability like this film.  I enjoyed it from start to finish.
B0095DC0B0|5.0|This is a short review of the 1 LP reissue of Damnation done by Music On Vinyl. It sounds spectacular. I highly recommend for those who own a turntable. There is no insert with lyrics or cool liner notes, just the outer sleeve and the heavy duty 180 gram LP in a nice plastic-lined paper inner sleeve. Since I really only care about the music, this isn't a big deal at all. Musically, it sounds great. Very well done reissue.
B000001GS2|5.0|the order was received on time  and even when was used it look like new ,after I play it in my stereo it was in perfect shape, no damaged ,no scratch, I very hapy and recommend the vendor to any bady
B009FLSKEI|5.0|So, this is arguably Opeth's heaviest and most brutal album. If you are looking to get into Opeth, do NOT start with this album. For me at least, it is the one that took me the longest to enjoy. Opeth is an acquired taste. Start with Heritage, Blackwater Park, Deliverance, or even Watershed.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm reviewing the 2 LP gatefold vinyl reissue done by Music On Vinyl. It's a beautiful gatefold. LPs are very heavy-duty 180g. Mikael's death metal vocals have never before sounded as brutal as they do on vinyl. Do yourself a favor and get a darn turntable if you don't have one yet! I find this LP edition MUCH better than the over-compressed and dynamic-less CD. If you like this album of Opeth's buy the vinyl edition. The only gripe I have is that there are no cool inserts with artwork or liner notes. Just the gatefold and two LPs. Still, I care about the music and how it sounds, and it sounds particularly spectacular on with these LPs.
B008OOYALE|3.0|First off, I love this game.  It is incredibly addicting and gratifying to play with, collect, and breed the dragons.  The art is charming and the social aspect is fun without being overly interactive with other players.<br /><br />But after playing it for a couple of months I am starting to become infuriated with the developers.  This game is originally programmed for ios systems and was put onto android later.  I'm glad they did put it on kindle but they are being totally negligent in updating the game on this system.  There are many, many amazing features ios players get to enjoy that kindle players cannot access, have not been able to access for a very long time, and have no dates to look forward to accessing them.  I completely understand that these things take time.  I waited happily for minecraft to update on xbox 360, I am not unwilling to wait for something good.  But it has been a long time since there have been any updates at all.<br /><br />The real salt in the wound is that we are able to see, even advertised, many of the options we have no access too.  We get to see the trade centers and new habitats of ios players, we get notification on new dragons but we can't actually access all of them and after a while it starts to make you really angry that you've spent time and sometimes real money in this version when you have no idea if you will ever be able to access all the functions.<br /><br />I was willing to wait but I'm starting to feel like I will be fed up with the game by the time Team Lava decides to punch up the code.  This is a very popular game that may be free to play but there are also people playing with real money and it is not exactly an indie title, there is no reason for this level of delay.  I feel like if they were not planning on updating then why not at least call it Dragon Story: Lite or something so at least people would have been prepared to not have all the same functions going into it or at the very minimum not allow us to see all the wonderful updates everyone else is getting so we could console ourselves with the cute dragons that we do have.<br /><br />Ultimately, if you want to play this game and have any opportunity to play it on an ios system, spare yourself the heartache and do so.  Do not pick this version.  If you still want to play it I think you'll still have a good time but brace yourself for daily disappointment at the limitations imposed on you.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Despite the huge success and great reviews of this book I resisted reading it as I read for pleasure and don't consider cancer, particularly cancer in children, as a subject of transformative interest. While never trivializing the seriousness of this devastating illness the book gave cancer somewhat of a backseat to the fact that people can still live while they are dying. This wasn't a happy book but it was a hopeful one, an enjoyable story well told.
B005G4TJUC|3.0|Transformers-Dark of the Moon(released June/11)stars,among others,Shia LaBeouf,Josh Duhamel,John Turturro,Tyrese Gibson,John Malkovich and Frances McDormand.With the voice talents of Steve Buscemi and every one's favourite Vulcan,Leonard Nimoy.This is a definite return to the good side of things,like night and day compared to film#2 in this franchise.This film however I found takes a rather more somber tone throughout than the first one.The first one had all the boffo elements in a magical combination that propelled it through the roof,while this one is much shorter on humour and heavier and longer on the action.<br />The story finds us going back to the early 60s and a lunar event detected by NASA.Something crashed on the moon and the crux is who will get there to investigate first,the U.S.or the Russians ? This supposedly is the premise behind Kennedy's admonition to go to the moon in /69.When Apollo 11 lands Armstrong and Aldrin are seen investigating the crash site and bringing back five devices and one round piece of alien technology.<br />Fast forward to today and Shia Lebouf has a hot new girlfriend but is out of work.Two small bots live with him.The autobots have been working closely with the U.S.military and on a trip to Chernobyl they recover the same round piece of technology that NASA found on the moon those many years before.Optimus Prime is mad because of the deception this has been to them.It is revealed only a handful of people knew about the mission,let alone the piece they found.Prime and others head to the moon and find the crashed ship,the Ark.They recover its pilot,Sentinel Prime,the leader of the entire Cybertron world before it' demise many years before.<br />Back on earth in a secret area Sentinel is brought back to life by Optimus.Sentinel now assumes Optimus's duties as leader.However it seems a deal was secretly struck between Sentinel and the Decepticons/Megatron years before.While the U.S.military only had five alien devices,the Decepticons already had hundreds of them they recovered ahead of Apollo 11.They were actually space bridges,which when powered around the world,would bring the home world of the Transformers into a close orbit around the earth.Sentinel plays along with Optimus until the time is right,then betrays him.Optimus and the rest of the good Autobots are forced to leave earth,which leaves it defenseless.This gives the Decepticons their chance to get their home world back and rule earth.<br />The space bridges are placed around the world and the center of it all is in Chicago.From here the Decepticons start their rampage.However they don't count on the return of Optimus,whose moves were designed to lull the Decepticons into a false sense of security.Just when they think they are on their way,Optimus and the boys slowly make their way into Chicago and start to take the Decepticons on full force.The star bridge beam is ultimately interrupted which destroys Cybertron.And in a twist,Megatron confronts Sentinel,as Megatron wants to be the only leader.He in fact kills Sentinel,who is in turn pounced on and killed by Optimus.The film ends as Optimus re swears the Autobots allegiance to the earth.<br />The ending and wrap up comes all too swiftly,just as we have endured an overly long and patience taxing fight between the earth forces,Autobots and the Decepticons in Chicago.It is as if they realized they were into overtime and had to get it over quickly.As I have mentioned there is a decided lack of humour in this one compared to the first film.Director Bay seems to have wanted to concentrate on battles and the more serious side of things.But along with this comes too many slow spots/overly detailed story segments.However the photography is very well done as is the S/FX.Watch for a surprise appearance by Buzz Aldrin,the second man to set foot on the moon.<br />Technically speaking,the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp.There are no extras.<br />All in all,while totally fumbling the ball in film#2,Bay has recovered nicely and come back with a film more worthy of the Transformers name.However it's over attention to plot detail,the overly long Chicago battle,super swift ending,and its over the top run time of just over 150 minutes make it an uneven and seat wiggling entry.It is a giant leap from the last and one hopes he can mix up a newer one with more of the spine tingling elements from his very first concoction.3- 3 1/2 stars.umbling the ball in film#2,Bay has recovered nicely and come back with a film more worthy of the Transformers name.However it's over attention to plot detail,the overly long Chicago battle,super swift ending,and its over the top run time of just over 150 minutes make it an uneven and seat wiggling entry.It is a giant leap from the last and one hopes he can mix up a newer one with more of the spine tingling elements from his very first concoction.3- 3 1/2 stars.
B001KZG99A|4.0|I really enjoyed the movie. It was a great movie and very creative. Robert Downy Jr. does a fantastic job as Iron Man.
B005T87QCI|3.0|I enjoy playing this game, but I wish the controllers were better or invisible like touching anywhere on the screen to control... It's difficult to hit the arrows and attack buttons because they're so small and my fingers are'nt. Other than that, very fun game!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I love this series and hope it doesn't get cut like so many other good series do.  It feels like this could be happening right at this moment, like it may not be too far off from reality.  I could imagine this happening to some of our guys over there.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Good book but makes my gf crazy sonetimes but overall an interesting addicting book. It was pretty nice to read
B007THA4FI|4.0|Not a Harry Potter maniac it I did like this story.  It drags at times but overall was a good solid read.  Interesting characters and several story lines kept my interest .  give it a try
B005JR3Y5W|5.0|Zooey Deschanel is a riot and backed up by a funny, goofy, and warm bunch of friends. Not for little kids.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Great book.  I have not seen the movie and was a bit distracted by imagining the characters like the movies trailers, but couldn't put this book down.  Sharing some experiences with mental  illness in my family brought the story to a more personal place.
B00B00RJJO|5.0|As always, it was well worth the wait. Bragg does not disappoint with the largely acoustic gift of &#34;Tooth and Nail&#34;.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I love the game! Collecting daily credits keeps me having fun. Be careful befriending others. its okay to be selective.<br />Customer service could use a little work.
0143113100|4.0|What if the human brain could repair itself upon injury or change itself such that it could accommodate for a lack of an important structure? The book, The Brain That Changes Itself by Norman Doidge, M.D. discusses how the effects of different neurological cases have been lessened or cured by using the science of neuroplasticity, meaning that the brain is able to change over time. Dr. Norman Doidge wears many hats, as he is a psychiatrist, psychoanalyst, researcher, and author. He is currently a member of the faculty of the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Toronto and he also serves on the Research Faculty at the Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research at Columbia University. As this book covers topics that are in his line of field, Dr. Doidge is able to easily break down the most inner complexities of the brain in order for the reader with no background in neurology to understand and become engaged in this science. However, this book promotes the idea that neural plasticity can cure any malady and that there seems to be no limitations to this practice even though these diseases and health concerns still persist today. Dr. Doidge fails to mention the extent of the brain damage in the patients who have received treatments, how they were chosen to be apart of the studies mentioned, and if there is a point at which plasticity is no longer a cure. For these reasons stated in more depth in the following paragraphs this book was rated a four out of five.<br /><br />  In order to follow along with the patient cases mentioned, the reader must understand the basis for the science of neuroplasticity, where the brain is able to alter and adapt to its ever-changing environment. On multiple occasions, the book referenced this idea that over time; if neurons or areas of the brain are not being used, then those regions will regress or be lost and their functions weaken. This is proven in a number of experiments discussed throughout the book. It was also seen in the experiments mentioned, that if an area of the brain was cut off from its associated region of the body, then the regions of the brain that surrounded the area that was lesioned was able to pitch in and help by spreading their sensory into that lesioned region. When the region of the body was touched, the signals were shown in the areas of the brain surrounding the area that was lesioned. Thus reinforcing that the brain is not simply stagnant in its ability to adapt but it can change or be molded by current events. Some of the topics mentioned are the constant feeling of falling, an over or under developed brain, technology to help with disabilities, effect of strokes on the brain, and phantom pain. Each chapter in this book takes the reader on a different journey of a different disorder of the brain, discussing how patients who have this disorder are able to, with the help of neuroplasticity, triumph of over their impairment to some extent.<br /><br />  As mentioned, the topics covered in this book range in the effects and implications. The book begins with a patient who feels as if she is in constant free fall. In short, the cause of this sensation is due to an organ associated with her balance system working improperly. Also included is having different regions of the brain under developed and developed enough, which can influence the way we think and behave. By doing exercises utilizing neuroplasticity, the patients can strengthen the regions of the brain that are affected. This is correlated to the chapter focused on children with learning disabilities, impairments in speech/language, and autism. The same types of treatment are used via computer software programs, to strengthen these areas of the brain that are impaired. The book also mention patients who had suffered from strokes, the use of plasticity has given back their mobility and speech. Another topic covered is how patients overcame phantom pain. Phantom pain is associated with a phantom limb, where a limb that was once there had to be amputated and after the procedure patients are able to feel pain in that non-existing limb. Plasticity was also used as treatment for sexuality and pleasure, patients with OCD, psychoanalysis, and to aid with a missing hemisphere in the brain. Also included were studies that examined patients imaging doing an activity versus actually participating in the same activity. The results found that imagining stimulates the same motor and sensory passages. This research has led to the development of technology as well as a more in-depth look and understanding between the mind and brain. The end of the book features the future of this science, by looking at the prospects of the neuronal stem cells and how to exercise the brain such that it stays sharp.<br /><br />  Dr. Doidge seamlessly weaves together stories about the patients while also talking about other important neurologists, scientists, and philosophers who have contributed to the idea of plasticity. His explanations are easy enough to follow along with for someone with little to no knowledge in this field. He goes into enough depth about how these scientists and physicians have gained their credibility through the various experiments they have been apart of, and how these experiments have led to the treatments put into practice for the type of disorder or malady mentioned in the chapter.<br /><br />  While Dr. Doidge does a great job introducing the reader to the various historic events, relevant science practices, and health conditions that are focused on in the book, the range of plasticity is not well explained. It is unclear whether there is a limit as to how much our brains are able to change with the use of plasticity and if there is a certain range at which plasticity works depending on the severity of the illness or malady. In the book, several of the chapters focus on a single individual and discuss what they are dealing with, the treatments available, the patients response to the treatment, long term improvements, and how this remedy is being applied to many other patients. However, there is no discussion of the range of how impaired they are in comparison to others who are living with the same condition. The way Dr. Doidge explains the idea of neural plasticity is that it can treat or heal almost anything, and if this is the case then why do we still see these impairments and illnesses to this day if they can be cured, especially since this science has been around for a number of years. Dr. Doidge also mentions how some of the patients are cured partially with devices, but does not go into detail about the requirements the patients had to qualify for in order to partake in the trails, which can be misleading as the reader is left wondering what the patients in the book had to do in order to qualify.<br /><br />  With these few loose ends, the rating given was a four out of five as the book is easy to read and stimulating for those with or without a background in the subject. The topic is very interesting and everyone is looking for a way to maintain and improve their physical as well as mental health, and neural plasticity is used to focus on the mental side and depending on the activity like dancing, it can also improve a person's physical health. Dr. Doidge chose interesting areas of the brain to include as well as the historical contexts involved with explaining treatments relating to the various cases discussed in the book. It will be interesting to see the importance of plasticity in the future with all the science and technology we have available at our disposal in order to find cures for the various ailments of the brain.

B00COGXGNQ|4.0|Close to the book, Liked the story and the actors. Perfect chick flick movie,for a girls night in or a quiet night relaxing.
B000TERDNO|5.0|Dang he has a sexy voice, I forgot how much I love Billy Idol!  There are sooooo many great songs on this CD it is great to have on my iPod.
B001HBYH9Q|2.0|Found this very hard to follow. was very slow in spots. Would not recommend to any of my friends. to me it was not worth the rentel
B000R9J3XE|5.0|Awesome CD with so many hits, I can listen to the whole thing no problem!  Great addition to my iPod : )
B004WGIXX4|5.0|If you love Natalie Portman you will love this movie. She is so hilarious!!! She should definitely make more comedy movies. Ashton Kutcher is great.
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|Excellent movie, I'm glad it's finally out on Blu-ray!  I bought it before it was released and watched it with my daughters and now they love it too : )
B000ID1J40|4.0|I liked the story line and the way it developed.  I also liked the light comic relief provided by Dan Akroyd against the seriousness of Sidney Poitier and Robert Redford.  The Hollywood/Redford irrational disdain and criticism of Republicans was unnecessarily present but only minimally and thus did not distract from the film as a whole.
B00AW0KHMY|5.0|extended wedding scene is great - read the book as well as have the movies - great romance scenes and constant action
B00A757EFW|5.0|It is easy to play and like the original game that I enjoyed playing as as teenager. Love it.<br />Awesome
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I love this app. Could play it for hours. Once you start you will not want to put it down.
B00632HWOG|4.0|I like yahoo app for the Lincolnshire it is easy to use much like the yahoo for a computer. A great way to keep in touch with friends and family.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|I installed this app to be able to see the file system on my Kindle Fire without connecting to my laptop.  This worked very well, just like the file explorer I am accustomed to on my other computers.<br /><br />I must have been set to automatic updates because this version, ES3, showed up a few weeks ago without my being aware of asking for it or being notified that an update was available for installation.<br /><br />Since I only occasionally used the previous version, I am not sure what changed with the new version.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|I thought I would be watching a typical Roman vs gladiator sword fight.<br />Little did I know that not only would you get sword fight, blood, glory, etc. but you would get plenty of soft porn too.<br />As a parent, this show is definitely NOT for younger children or even pre-teens.<br />Some of the sexual stuff is what I would call soft porn since you are getting full nudity and sexual acts.<br />Be warned!<br />But the series itself is exciting and you like a soap opera.
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|If you enjoy the other albums, I believe you will enjoy this one just as much if not more.  &#34;Steps&#34; is one of  my faves.
B0072OFM28|5.0|This was a great action packed movie series.<br />Because of watching this, I will now get Xfinity so that I can watch the third season.<br />So thanks for all the viewing fun I will now have.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Can't get enough of this series, wonderful story  best I've seen in a long time. well worth the price, you won't be disappointed
1569242739|5.0|Love this cookbook , loads of great ideas for the sweet  tooth loving vegan / lactose free individual, Even non Vegans can't tell
B007BVOEPI|5.0|After reaing the books, I was slightly sceptical how it would be pertrayed on the small screen. I was total surprised and very pleased how well this was done, even though, it is quite graphic for younger folks. I have also watched season 2 and pre-ordered season 3. I highly recommend this series.
B009HUB40Y|3.0|I would like the game better if the connection was not so bad. I have tried to return to play and I can never get a good connection.
B009GED3HS|5.0|This is one of those shows everyone loves. It's witty, fast-paced, all-star cast, and highly entertaining. My only complaint is the pricing: it's way too high! There should not even be a choice to buy \\"SD\\" and the HD prices should be the same as the current SD prices. Remember, the episodes are only 20-25 minutes long without the advertisements..
B008MG1E4A|5.0|GREAT BOOK ... this is a first hand account on the mission that killed OBL ... and life of a Navy Seal that was part of that mission
B000W1W9EW|5.0|For me, this is the very best of Nick Drake. Just him and his guitar, stripped down. Maybe an occasional piano track to add some nuance. This album (sadly his last) takes the listener to places both unimagined and at the same time, recognizable through life's journey...the pain, the joy, the sadness...it's all there. HIGHLY HIGHLY recommended.
B0082RHRHC|5.0|Charlotte Bronte was God's servant to have penned such a romantic and instructive love story. The book of Ruth has it's parallel in Jane's life story. Lessons on life and love, sacrifice and sorrow, redemption, hope, true devotion and salvation are in these pages. Read with an open heart. Prepare to be challenged and rewarded.

B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|I enjoyed this movie as it was very close to the book, (alittle dramatic license here and there, ie Bilbo finding the ring) and the characters were as I imagined them. I thought it was a good choice by the producers to maintain the original actors/characters which made the film cohesive with the Lord of the Rings Trilogy and defined the focus of the story.<br /><br />I was disappointed that it was not noted that the film was a &#34;part one&#34;.
1594745692|3.0|I bought this deck yesterday because it looked interesting.  It wasn't until I had pierced the plastic that I realized it had a major problem:  The backs have a motif that is not mirror-image and you can tell whether a card is reversed.  Now I have to wonder if the makers know anything about the Tarot.

B002T921AC|5.0|&#34;Dear Abby&#34; was giving advice to a reader who wrote her for help on a messy fiance and she suggested looking up &#34;The Fly Lady&#34;.  &#34;The Fly Lady&#34;....?  Don't think of a house fly....&#34;Fly&#34; stands for &#34;Finally Loving Yourself&#34; which is something that most of us don't do when our lives at home become unmanageable and overwhelming.  No one, except Jesus, has told me to &#34;love myself&#34; especially in the middle of chaos at home.....except &#34;The Fly Lady&#34;.  She is very sympathetic and very helpful in helping you get your home back in order....all without guilt and condemnation and shame.  I just love her book and website.  The website is chock full of info that is constantly being updated  with tips and guidance, but I like having a book to reference alonside of me, too.<br /><br />Fabulous book.  Get it for yourself or someone you love whose home is in an overwhelming dissary.  The Fly Lady is wonderful.  You won't regret it.

B00C7L4QB4|2.0|Here is the promo line about this series on Amazon:<br />Hannibal Season 1<br />Before SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, before RED DRAGON, Hannibal Lecter was a brilliant psychiatrist in the employ of the FBI.<br /><br />Here is the main problem with the series:  This Hannibal Lecter just isn't brilliant.<br /><br />I am a big fan of the books and the films, and I was really looking forward to this series.  After the first episode I thought, \\"okay, it looks like it will get interesting, I'll buy it and watch.\\"  Nope.<br /><br />It's all plot and no character.  We are told that Will Graham is on the autism spectrum.  I just don't see it.  We are told that Lecter is highly intelligent and a brilliant psychiatrist.  I just don't see it.  People comment each episode on how charming he is.  Is he?  Hmmmmm.  He says things that could be charming but they just lay flat.  We are TOLD Crawford is a hard driving FBI director, just don't see it.<br /><br />If Hannibal Lecter was as highly educated and brilliant in his field as we are told, he would have learned to speak more eloquently and clearly instead of sounding like he is about to sell Muesli to senior citizens.<br /><br />There is no suspense.  When the show tries to get slow and deep, it misses deep and just hits slow.  Shallow characters without enough background work.<br /><br />And the female characters . . . haven't liked one yet.  Amanda - weird, but not weird in the right way.  The FBI psychiatrist - please, this woman did not go to college.  And Mrs. Crawford?  I just finished watching Episode 5.  Annoying.  I wanted to smack her when the self-pity-party just wouldn't end.<br /><br />It's a shame, it looks like a talented cast.  I have to attribute it to bad writing and bad directing.  Someone is just cashing in on the popularity of the past vehicles and not really doing any new and gritty writing.<br /><br />Oh, and the series should be called \\"Will of Grace\\" (just kidding) or something like that, because it is really about Will Graham and not Hannibal Lecter.  Maybe Lecter will eat a bad kidney and choke on a stone?  Now THAT'S gritty!

630542828X|5.0|Here is PI attorney, not a court fighter and this case gets to him, it becomes personal. Issue can affect many of us in our lives, that thing of what is right, ouch. Fight or flight? Well this about tells you how one man took a stance, willing to pay the price many will not and darned I can only wish it were mandatory to show those under age 12 in schools. As for college students to now have one semester in ethics before they can graduate doesn't cut it, it's learned early or not at all. I so adore this movie and the acting is simply great and real.
B0036S4C6G|4.0|When I began reading this book, I was a little suspicious; after the first chapter I was interested; by the end of the second chapter I was hooked.<br /><br />More than a single storyline, this book has an unique structure, with stories and characters that connects sometimes horizontaly, sometimes verticaly ( I can't be more clear one this one, don't want to spoil it).<br /><br />Aside from this structure, which is what most commands your attention, the characters and stories themselves are  (sometimes very) interesting and well crafted.<br /><br />No doubt, a must read.
B005PK57IK|5.0|So good and even though the story line of each episode is great and keeps you enticed, the relationship between Will and Alicia is what really keeps me watching. Not just another lawyer/detective type drama

Totally different from some of my other favorites done with Waylon, etc. This is another great CD that provides great listening.
B00992CF6W|2.0|My 6 year old grandson did lots of chores so that I would purchase this. There were NO directions and the idea of the game took forever for he and I to figure out. ( I was a media teacher so am not a novice!) I tried to get directions from all over but couldn't. It has been a few weeks and he is kinda' getting it but that is not acceptable. It was an expensive game!

B00CHILW64|2.0|Special effects were good, but the story line was fragmented and it was not easy to get into the characters or empathize with them
B00CDSVZHY|2.0|If you like seeing blood and guts you'll love this movie. Life is cheap to all the leading characters. It portrays racial hatred and even glorifies it in the end. Only person in the movie that had showed any character was the dentist, flawed as it was. The only redeeming feature of the film of portraying the suffering of slaves in the south does not justify the explicit violence and gory detail.<br /><br />Where is the entertainment value unless you're a masochistic psychopath. Big money is always spent on these film and are often used for propaganda or to accomplish subtle objectives. The objective of this film I think would be to lessen the sacredness of life, create division among peoples and desensitize people to violence. If the ultimate objective is to control a population this film goes a long way toward that objective. I'll bet the masochistic psychopaths in control of our country loved it as they condone torture of prisoners, death panels for the elderly and endless wars (73 at current count). To some up in one word - sick.
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|Well, Jeremy Renner just doesn't have Matt Damon's charm and believability. But this is an excellent futuristic sequel to the Bourne series, and I missed Matt Damon only because of his superb work in the previous movies. Rachel Weisz is a neuroscientist working on human (biochemical) mind control - the futuristic part of the movie. The action and intrigue are great. Well worth owning this blu-ray!
B0063IH60K|5.0|good stuff! hard to mess up solitaire, so this is one of the good ones.  many are crappy,  but this one is sure bet
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|Don't listen to the critics who have already pigeon-holed Cruise into a Mission Impossible actor-producer who can do nothing else well. This is a great story of intrigue, and Cruise's character is excellent in his portrayal. I did not read the book. The movie was better than I expected, and therefore a &#34;sleeper&#34; in my view. Be prepared for some gruesome violence.

B009RI4FRU|4.0|Edward Norton in his most benign and unbelievable (?) scout leader role, Bill Murray is perfect as the philosophizing psychologist who is a terrible parent. Odd little story about a runaway boy scout who teams up with a runaway girl, both pursued by their families and the scout troop, it is a &#34;relationship movie&#34; between the two youngsters on a PG level. A nice subplot involves Bruce Willis and Francis McDormand (the island cop and Murray's wife, mother of the missing girl), who are romantically involved.
B004GYY714|5.0|I love the fact that I can get my local Public Radio station better with this app than I can over the air. And what quality, true Hi-Fi.

B008Q09K2U|5.0|Realistic characters, with spell binding story line. Lots of action and the writers unique dry humor allows for a lot of smiles.
B005ORVMCY|4.0|This review is intended for folks who already have other versions of these discs and are wondering if the new Andy Vandette masterings are worthwhile.  Short answer for box 2 is that these are very good in some ways, but not better than all other versions.  My take is that the 97 remasters are actually better than these for Farewell to Kings and Hemispheres because of graphic equalization choices, while Moving Pictures is equivalent to the 2011 disc and Perm Waves is better than the 97 edition (I've never heard the Mercury, and the MFSL is slightly better).  Box 3 is included here, too, which fares a bit worse.  I can't comment on the 5.1 mixes, since my setups are all stereo.<br /><br />My notes continue the review I started for Sector 1, where I also briefly compare the hi-res 24/96 downloads of Sector 1 and conclude that there's no apparent benefit to the higher resolution versions over the CDs, at least from a headphone-listening perspective.<br /><br /> keep in mind that all the albums from Moving Pictures forward in this series were originally 16-bit digital recordings.  So the main sonic differences between the Sector boxes and other available versions will be things like treble boost and loudness, along with whatever mastering gizmos the engineer felt like plugging in.  Sometimes they run the digital master through good analog equipment and recapture back to digital, which can sound good (somehow), and I think MP was actually mixed in analog after being recorded digitally, oddly enough; but there's a limit to how much \\"better\\" any recordings from this era can sound from their original incarnations.  I found Hold Your Fire shrill on the Sector box, for instance.<br /><br />Hemispheres from Sector 2 is very close in most respects to the 1997 remaster, I think (and the SHM).  I've done an extensive 3-way that also included my Mercury 80s CD, which I believe was taken from a second-generation master tape but still in some ways (tonal balance, vocal track and acoustic guitar clarity) is still a bit better than the others.  But once \\"La Villa Strangiato\\" really starts cranking, the 97 master and the Mercury CD under headphone-listening both become brittle-sounding, especially at higher frequencies, because there's just so much going on.  Here, Vandette's EQ decisions, which make the album \\"darker\\" than other versions, seem rational; the Sector Hemispheres starts out sounding less interesting than either of the other versions, but Strangiato keeps its feet at points where the other masterings get harsh.  But again, that was under headphones.  When I repeated the comparison through my speakers, the Sector 2 Hemispheres was so bass-overpowering that I had to turn down the subwoofer, and that revealed that the whole thing is just \\"shrouded\\" by the EQ decisions.  Too much bass, too little in the midrange.  By comparison, the 1997 disc is much more open, and there's just more music to hear.  Less bass, but still more than on most CDs and very punchy.  Drums sound much more natural.  The original Mercury does audibly fall short as well in terms of definition.  Going back to headphones, I am now still bothered by the Sector 2 disc.  I suppose one could get up and adjust their own equalizer, but I hate fiddling with recordings that way, given that a good recording and good setup simply don't need it anyway.  Bye-bye, Sector 2 Hemispheres.  Got earbuds?  You'll probably love it.  The 1997 disc is also not as good as this can sound, so this album still needs some love from somebody.  I'm ok, though, with what I got.<br /><br />On Farewell to Kings, I have the same comments as for Hemispheres.  The 1997 mastering sounds much fuller in the mid-range, which makes the drums on Xanadu, for instance, sound more three-dimensional than on the Sector version.  There seem to be several spots in the Sector boxes where a sort of \\"rock and roll\\" EQ philosophy was applied--lots of bass/treble, not so much in the upper midrange.  On Farewell to Kings, I think it does more harm than good because that album has a very \\"live\\" sound to it.  On the other hand, I can easily tell why Vandette did it: the Sector version is tonally more well-balanced than the very bright 1997 disc (or SHM--said to be the same mastering).  But the better tonal balance does push the drums back, which makes me feel like I'm hearing less of the music.  No complaints about any other aspect of this disc--meaning that I can't hear any other differences at all.  The funny thing is that people complain already about the 1997 remasters for having this same EQ problem.  So it seems like we've gone from problematic (although I don't have a problem with this aspect) to more problematic.<br /><br />For Moving Pictures, the difference between the Sector version and the 24-bit download from a couple of years ago seems very slight and perhaps just a matter of a little EQ.  So, Sector is as good a version as you need here (or the 24-bit download).<br /><br />Grace Under Pressure is just not as open or clear as the original 80s Mercury CD, either because of or in addition to the compression applied to it for the Sector box. I spent a long time doing that comparison, not wanting to believe my ears.  Andy Vandette says plainly in a Googlable interview that he mastered the box sets with \\"earbuds and laptops\\" in mind.  For Grace Under Pressure, I guess dynamic range is extremely important for keeping Geddy's vocals above the synthesizers and for letting Neil's drums have their space.  That's compromised on the Sector box, where a lot of compression was applied (though it's not \\"brickwalled\\"), so I don't know if it's mastering or source that's the culprit.  In the same interview, he says he worked for three days on GUP trying to get a sound that was \\"as good as the original CD,\\" so he knew he wasn't going to stun people with this one.  The shortcomings are less vivid through speakers than they are under headphones, but are still audible.<br /><br />Power Windows remains best on the Japanese SHM-CD, which uses the Japanese mastering.  Significantly sharper than the Sector box.  One fan on the Rush forum spotted extra notes on the \\"Mystic Rhythms\\" fade-out on the box set: that could either have been added later (like, famously, the last refrain on \\"The Weapon,\\" absent from the MFSL) or it could mean that the Sector uses an earlier master.  Don't know which, but the SHM sounds to me like better source material.<br /><br />On the remaining discs of interest to me (Signals, Waves), the differences seem mostly about compression.  On Permanent Waves, the MFSL still wins out for me because compression makes the Sector version a little unnatural on the more dynamic parts (e.g., near the beginning of \\"Jacob's Ladder\\").  You'd never notice this except in a very unnatural side-by-side intensive comparison, though.<br /><br />On Signals, it's interesting that the Sector version seems even more volume-maximized than the rest of the discs.  Initially, it sounds great and even better than the MFSL.  But I then discovered that the MFSL sounds really, really awesom when cranked up...a lot.  Dynamic range wins again.  But this is a very good mastering of Signals, and at rational volumes sounds better, especially on the first track where bass is cleaner/punchier than the MFSL.<br /><br />But the good news is that, except for the compression, Vandette has managed to match the quality of the MFSLs in all cases, which is an accomplishment. ...I guess (I donnow: is it hard to do, now that everyone has 24/192 or DSD equipment in their studios?).<br /><br />Whew!  There's a day in my life I'll never get back...<br />Thanks to several of my peers who generously provided their own recordings used my me to flesh out these comparisons.

B002VECM4A|3.0|I liked the movie, but was disappointed in the DVD itself.  It is defective.  I saw most of the movie, and then it stopped on a frame and wouldn't continue.  I had to skip to the next scene.  So I did miss out on a small part of it.
B008FSCNTK|4.0|If someone buys this new Diana Krall album expecting what they heard on The Very Best of Diana Krall which is the other CD I own by her then that's not what they are going to hear. What they are going to hear is just as good though. Diana Krall has ventured into some new areas that harken to Vaudeville, Rag Time, Country, Rockabilly and her more well popular standard sounding stuff. I think it was very brave of her to do this and I think the turnout is a product that is very enjoyable on its own merit. T-Bone Burnette is really a very good producer to bring out these new sides of Diana Krall.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Still reading the book, but so far I'm enjoying it.  Hard to put down at times can't wait to see how it ends.  I think whoever reads the book will enjoy it.
B00B23O96A|4.0|Everybody has already written the technical stuff about this record so I'm not gonna do it again. What I am going to say is that when I bought the album \\"Clapton\\" I thought,\\"Okay, this is a bunch of covers.\\" After I listened to it, I said, \\"Wow! This is a bunch of very well done covers.\\" Recently I bought the follow up album \\"Old Sock\\". I said the same thing again and this time  Eric even threw in some big guest stars. Clapton must be having a lot of fun and I'm glad to be enjoying it with him. Buy Clapton and Old Sock and join in the celebration of a great guitarist sharing a great bunch of songs from all generes.

I highly recommend this book to every citizen - particularly the givers.

B00CE6E6B2|1.0|I thought this game would be a fun building game, but it is very limited in time to work and too many missions to complete at once.  If it had unlimited energy or at least enough to accomplish at least 2/3 of the work to be done, it would be better.  You put in crops, and you don't have enough energy to collect them so they die by the time you get back and garbage is everywhere.  You either have to pick one thing you are going to do and forget about the rest or do little bits of each and not accomplish anything.  Removed it from my device!
B00C2VIA52|3.0|The game is worth playing since there are so few TCG on the kindle but I would have rather paid for the game rather than shelling out money for a chance to get rare cards.

B00AE2J5HI|1.0|I thought this to be a good guy bad guy chase movie. No, it is kill and be killed. Useless violence. So much killing and blood spurting that I could not watch this one. It was not what I thought it would be. When you wonder about gun violence. This is one that should make Hollywood responsible for glorifying violence. This could have been done without the blood and gore. I would have watched the good guy bad guy chasing each other. But when they cut throats beat them to death and you never even get to the chase. I rate this less than one star. You just did not have it to rate this low.

I've already gotten tired of it. But it will be back on repeat soon!

0694003611|5.0|This is a perfect first book to give at a baby shower, a child's first birthday, a christening, or a christmas or hanukkah present.  Parents will love to read this book and it will quickly become a child's favorite for bedtime reading.  Highly recommend this for all those newborns.
B00COGY6YO|5.0|My son loved this movie as he loves anything Lego and is a huge Lego fan. The movie was just the right length for my 6 yr old son
0307200477|5.0|Pat the Bunny is a book with great appeal for very young children since it includes all the things to touch which the books describes.  It is often a favorite of the very young.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I purchased and have used Swiftkey for the past 2 years+. After an update to 4.1.1, my Galaxy 3 would default to the stock Samsung keyboard whenever I would restart my phone. After a great deal of research, I found that it is not a problem with the update or with Swiftkey. It (for me) was a problem with Google Play and way it installs apps on your phone. I uninstalled the Google Play version and purchased and installed the Amazon version and Viola! Whenever I restart my phone, Swiftkey is my default keyboard again!
B00BUCW54Q|4.0|I was not sure really what to expect from this movie, but I was pleasantly surprised.  There were a few great action scenes.
B006UW4OB8|5.0|Love EWallet and have been using it since the beginning.<br />Was totally tickled when I found that Amazon had made it available for the Fire!<br />(easier to read there than on my pod :))
B00BJS7104|5.0|This was by far the best movie I have seen in a long time.  Each of the characters were great.
B000002AS1|5.0|The music from Forrest Gump is beautiful as well as emotional. It outlines the spirit and soul of the movie very well and reminds us all of how important each of us is, regardless of our differences or challenges. It also reminds us of how much of an impact our actions have on each other and how interconnected we truly are with all people. We all have a responsibility to each other as well as ourselves.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|Great acting but I was not so much entertained as I was brought to feel anxious watching these struggling characters just trying to live simple lives, stress and anger free!<br /><br />Suggestion: go to a crowded mall and stress, not to a movie...
B006M4RN3U|4.0|Buy it you will like it! It really is fun. Everyone in the car can enjoy it and sing alone.

0061726834|3.0|Delirium by Lauren Oliver was such a fresh dystopian read for me. Who would've thought that love (amor deliria nervosa) was a disease? Well, these people in the book do. When they turn 18, they automatically have to get cured, meaning that they will have to undergo an examination where it would totally change who they are. There are those who strictly agrees that they should be cured from love, and there are the resistance who thinks that getting cured from love is completely wrong and shouldn't be practiced. In Delirium, we witness how Lena's opinion transforms from agreeing to disagreeing with the cure.<br /><br /> Throughout Lena's life, she always believed that love was a disease especially because of the tragedy that happened to her mother. She lives with her aunt's family which has a huge impact on how she perceives love. Lena is easily relatable and likable. One thing I like about this book is how the main character slowly develops throughout the novel. She wasn't a flat, boring, dull heroine which I was glad for. The male protagonist, Alex, was easily likable too. For me, he's the key to Lena's adieu to innocence. I love how Alex isn't just there so there could be a romance. He's more than just a love interest. He plays a big role in the story, and because of him, something happens that would leave the readers shocked. The other character I wanted to talk about is Lena's best friend Hanna. At first I loved her character because at first she strongly opposes the cure by breaking the government's rules. She goes out to parties after the curfew, listens to loud music (which was illegal) and was just plain outgoing & awesome. Then, I don't know what happened, but all of a sudden she strongly agrees with the government. There was definitely an inconsistency to her character. I was really disappointed by that.<br /><br />Since the book is about love, the romance plays a big role in the story. Fortunately, it played out well. Lena and Alex's relationship gradually develops. Although I didn't have any problem with the romance, I wouldn't say it's the best. Same thing with the characters, they were likable but they didn't really stick with me. The pacing slowed a little bit here and there, but it wasn't super slow that would cause boredom. There were also action scenes to watch out for especially towards the end. Overall I enjoyed reading Delirium and would recommend it to those who wants to read something new. Also, I can't wait till they make this into a t.v. show!develops. Although I didn't have any problem with the romance, I wouldn't say it's the best.

B00475AYJQ|2.0|I read The Name of the Wind, and loved it to pieces.  So complex, fascinating, and with well crafted characters.<br /><br />This book, unfortunately, let me down compared to the great foundation laid in the first book.<br /><br />Kvothe is a very intelligent man, with an exceptional memory.  First off, he forgets a key event that occured at the end of the last book (only a few weeks to a few months at most of time in world has passed).  For the first quarter of the book I felt Kvothe was acting stupid, because, well, the plot required it to make tension.  It didn't work.<br /><br />The rest of the book is Kvothe being petty, Kvothe having lots(and lots) of sex-in an inane, trite, and distasteful manner, Kvothe being  cruel to his friends, Kvothe being a ruthless killer, Kvothe being just...dumb.  It's like his intelligence has been dumbed down exceedingly in this novel compared to the previous one.<br /><br />The entire book felt like poor filler, and was more along the lines of George R. R. Martin's writing style (everyone has their own agenda; blood, familial bonds, love, etc. have absolutely no value or integrity in the end).  That is not a compliment from me.<br /><br />Patrick Rothfuss has beautiful prose, and The Wise Man's Fear shows it.  Unfortunately, prose filled with dross is still dross.  No matter how much it sparkles doesn't make it gold.<br /><br />Just because Kvothe lost his childhood innocence does not mean he has to become a grade A jerk, with nearly no redeeming character.  If you make me want to root for your \\"hero\\" or \\"antihero\\", you have to give me cause.<br /><br />I'm hoping the next book makes up for it, but I'm not sure the ride will even be worth reading after this.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show has been a study in personalities revealed over time. I find the ones I hated at the start became the ones I loved by the end of last season

B004NELBPC|4.0|User friendly, tends to be very up to date, interesting stories. I probably use this app every single day. Thumbs up.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I have been looking for a game where you can make stuff and my friend showed me at school and said I'd probably love this game. I did.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Although this book was disturbing in it's content, it was a page turner I just couldn't put down. Landay paints an accurate description of every parents worst nightmare. He definitely makes one wonder how far you would go to protect your child. I thought the writing was excellent. The ending left me saddened and surprised.
B001IB63KQ|5.0|For whatever reason many live albums disappoint. This one doesn't. I'm enjoyig Riot all over again in a brand new way.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|What a great CD. I have enjoyed it over and over. The songs are breathtaking. Make you want to go to Italy, to Puerto Fino!
B00ACHXHII|5.0|I came to Silvestri through Jeff Lipscomb (that savant reviewer after whom I shall name a good park bench). Where to begin to describe the wonders of this set? Take Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique...I had not listened to this marvelous score for about a year, so before popping Silvestri in, I started with Davis's LSO (1965 or something like that) on Philips - by the time the waltz came around, I had to escape that studiously serviceable recording. You have to be able to listen a reference recording through. Not this one. I moved to Cluytens from the Great Conductors series...just the waltz. Much more interesting but not very characterful. To hell with it, let's go to Silvestri. I did what I rarely do when listening to a piece. I skipped ahead...to the waltz. Massive cobweb clearing moment, this. Such tremendously inspired orchestral characterization! I have not heard such play made with the oboes and the low strings. And the pizzicati shaping the phrases..he makes you hear it! At 5:07 hear how he makes the dancers positively take off...such impeccably controlled abandonment. Like Kleiber (son) in the Freischutz overture reprise. This set is going to be a tremendous source of joy.<br /><br />Buy it without hesitation!
B008R6MI8G|3.0|May go back and try to watch the whole movie.  Very thick accents and difficult for this American to understand.
B00992CF6W|4.0|this game is addicting! I could play it for hours! the inventory does not have as wide of a selection as survivalcraft. if you want more advanced and more realistic building, get survivalcraft. but overall this is a great app.
B008B1BL4E|4.0|There is fantastic detail in this work that I have never read before. Before you begin, you should know that the book's length and sometimes tedious detail require a major commitment of time and concentration. I learned so much about European history beyond just World War One.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Great series.<br />The bad guys are not all bad. Love plays a vital role. And there is magic in life, a great combination.
0486275590|5.0|This is an accurate reprint of one of my favorite classics. I'm really fond of the travel friendly form but be advised, the Dover Thrift Edition is slim and has very small print.
B00BF123WG|4.0|The movie was dark so be prepared. i think there is a lot of torture done by various countries but not sure I like to see it. The movie shows how you have to hang in there on an investigation. It takes smarts and tenacity like anything else you want to do well. Plus in this case, it took money and a CIA budget.<br /><br />The movie did not do a very good job with human relationships. Still it was exciting and emotionally rewarding.
0007466064|4.0|If you are enjoying the Game of Thrones series you will enjoy this one too. Fingers crossed that the author will come out with #6.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|From start to finish, I couldn't put this book down.  It captures the deep bond of mother and son, even in the most depraved circumstances.
B009KEN87O|5.0|I love this game. This reminds me a whole lot of Space Invaders. I like this better than space invaders.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|This was a book download to my IPad and I have not read it yet.  It downloaded great and knowing Nicholas Sparks, it will be very good.

B007SGM084|4.0|I gave this series a 4 out of 5 because the story itself was good, but not great. Book one was slow to get moving, book two was a little easier to get going and book three was better than the others, maybe because the character development was already in place. Would love to see how and if they can do a film version of this story.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|so much fun you can occasionally just check in on it it is great for bordum or planes so so so awesome
B001DM1VXE|1.0|This is definitely 1+ hours of my life I wish I could get back!! The photography was horrible, the plot had no flow, and the acting was horrible.  A piece of pure garbage!!! I only wish I could rate negative stars because I'd give it a minus 5! Don't waste your time!!
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|The setting of this book really shows what happens with extreamism and isolation of any group.  We see today and we will see it in the future if we don't wipe ourselves off of this earth because of it.  This setting makes for a situation that can get the hackles up.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Love it, can't wait for more! Somewhat tricky, nice graphics. As others have said, do not use hints if you'd like the game to last longer.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|All my friends had this on their phones now we Kindle users can have it too. Love the tank and how the diesal actually &quot;rolls coal!&quot;
B005D4YOHI|3.0|This is my second pair of Keen sandals, love them.<br />Oddly, although this pair are exactly the same size as my existing ones (US10.5, Euro 44) they are definitely SMALLER.  The inside length seems right for my foot but the sole is slightly shorter and the top straps are way too tight, too tight to wear.<br /><br />Byer be aware!  The size of these will not be what you think, even comparing to your existing shoes.<br /><br />Unfortunately return postage from Asutralia is almost the cost of the shoes (AusPost why is it so?).<br /><br />That said, great shoes, highly recommended, but buy in store.
B009LGO88E|4.0|Works just like it should.  Nintendo should have added it to the system instead of making it an attachment though, almost makes the system too bulky.
B003KK65KG|5.0|Jodi Picoults books are always good. I found this one totally absorbing as bullying is very prevelent these days. A great read,.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|As someone who worked with the MEF and US Army in FOBs in Iraq and Afghanistan, I have some understanding and much appreciation of the skill sets and mindset of the men and women who served in these AOs.  But, Kyle's book is an eye opener and provides eye opening insights into the thinking, feelings and non-feelings of a professional shooter at the top of his game. A very honest and interesting account of his missions, remembrances, and challenges from training to out processing. A recommended read for any American who does not understand what we ask of our service personnel and the professionalism with which they complete the tasks/missions.  Thank you very much for your service and sacrifices Mr. Kyle.

B008XCM18Q|3.0|I read the Bourne series 30 years ago; what a difference three decades makes.  From today's perspective, the premise of the book is inaccurate and irrelevant, while the writing repetitious and monotonous.  Mr. Ludlum could have deleted 50% of the text and probably developed a more cohesive, interesting novel. I rated it 3 stars at best.  It was a labor to slog through it and the movie was certainly a better use of my time.
B002O2THRO|5.0|[[ASIN:B001K3EXTA The Great Gatsby (1974)]]<br /><br />While I really enjoyed the new film, the original still holds up.  The performances by Robert Redford, Mia Farrow and Sam Waterston were phenomenal!!!  I forgot how moving this movie was......<br />The whole build up was perfect up until the climax and the storytelling was intricate without being overtly blathering.<br />It is a classic story, a classic movie and an event in and of itself......
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|Harden does a good job of translating Shin's story into an interesting account of his camp experience, escape and transition to a Western life.  The book is sprinkled with Shin's and other characters feelings and insights. Shin may not be the easiest person to like, but his escape and journey from North Korea are remarkable.
B0087HT36U|3.0|Bought this a while back and put this on my new phone. It played fine before but won't now. The free version on the Play store opens up fine but the one I paid for crashes even after reinstalling several times.  This version does not work on Android 4.2.

B00CQD2PUC|5.0|I recently went to the U.K., and created an itunes account while I was there.  This was available in their store in April, and this week they offered one of her songs as the \\"free single of the week\\".  Amazing that I had to go to another continent to find out about an artist who is from Tennessee, just up the road from where I live.  I believe she is going to set the music world on fire.  There is something about the way she looks, coupled with the honesty and pureness of her music that just captivates.  It's twangy, bluesy, and even has shades of Winehouse in there as well.  I'm really glad Amazon is making the \\"on demand\\" cd-r of this album available, since the album doesn't drop here until August.  The sound is great, and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves discovering a new artist who's blossoming--before the rest of the world catches on.  She is definitely one to watch.  Google her, and check out the youtube video introducing this album.  I suspect she is a huge star in the making.  She's certainly stirring things up in the U.K.

B000VSYDRM|4.0|Tykwer is one of my favorite directors. The story is very original and the film is well done. I highly recommend it.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I've always wanted to get this but it was always on the iPod/iPhone but now it's here. The game is great just like the one in the Apple store
B005J2UM9S|4.0|So much horror is just schlock, but this film had some genuinely creepy moments. I am very picky about which films I will waste 1.5-2 hours on, and this was a good choice.
0307394549|5.0|I love this.recipe book! The table of contents.makes it so easy to find the perfect cookie that you are looking for. It's categorized by texture such as chewy, crumbly, etc. It also has a picture of each cookie so you know what it looks like before you start baking!

B000IZA9PI|3.0|The movie was may have been good at its time in 2002, but seems a little old when you watch it now.<br />Other than the movie having that 'old' 90s look, I feel the story line was good.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love it, love it, love it!! If you're not a fan of apocalyptic stories or zombies than this isn't the show for you. In this season we see the world of humans as treacherous as that of zombies.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Sheryl Sandberg expresses with great precision the joys, challenges, opportunities and pitfalls of women today.  I could personally relate to her experiences, doubts, observations based on my own 40 year career.  I would highly recommend this book to men and women alike as there are many &#34;takeaways&#34; which if applied could substantially improve quality of home, family and career life for all.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this pintrest it is so fun and time consuming. I can spend hours on pintrest!  there are so many different catagories to choose from and my favorite is DIY
B001DJ7PQ4|4.0|I love this show, but the only problem was that the packaging was broken. The things that hold the DVDs in place in the center were broken, so that the DVDs are not held securely and flopped out as soon as the package was opened.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I had put off reading this series, because face it, books are seldom as good as they are hyped to be...but this on is!  It was impossible to put down !
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This book will have you in suspense. A real page turner. Romance with suspense at its best. You will enjoy.
B00A2IUHM6|5.0|Great movie, very funny!! Wish I had a real Ted :) I would recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys comedies or just is in the mood for a good laugh!
B0064MPXFA|3.0|I think the court cases are good but the intrigue with the husband is a total yawn.  The kids dont strike me as realistic either.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Works just as good as advertised. Downloading is fast and easy. I wish though it was a litle easier to find the downloaded content once its complete though.
B00008YJHC|5.0|The Pixies experimented here with a different sound from previous albums, overall quieter than the earlier and overall louder Pixies albums, many of these songs having a dreamlike, sci-fi quality.  Back around '89/'90 I had just returned Dolittle to the local shop for a refund, thinking that album was too harsh, and soon thereafter thought to give this album a try.  I loved this album so much, that it was enough to compel my giving Dolittle another try--and eventually came to consider Dolittle a classic.  Yet there are so many good songs here.  From the instrumental opening track, which is like a rollicking tribute to Ennio Morricone's spaghetti western music, to the dreamy, other-worldly \\"Velouria,\\" to the heavy drive of \\"Down to the Well.\\"  In a way these songs sound more serious in tone and subject matter, just a different feel overall from the previous albums that seemed to have funnier and more bizarre lyrics, but still a great sound, still fresh today, and unmatched by most bands.
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|We Need to Talk About Kevin is not an easy book in the sense that it is about a difficult topic, but it is an extremely compelling read.  It was one of the rare books that we discussed in book group for more than 20 minutes and is still memorable among the many we have read in the past 16 years.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|the plots stay interesting and inventive. the cast relationship grows wonderfully.<br />i love the interactions of them all. great show!
B005HJ6MRO|4.0|I've used WD from the 1990s when I was building PCs and still they are my preferred brand, so being able to use my WD N900 as a backup device as well as router seems right.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I wanted to read it before watching the movie and I wonder how they were able to reflect the inner thoughts of Pat in the movie.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|When I think I am weaned away from Aloysious Pendergast, writers Preston and Child come back with a segment of the saga that pulls me in. This one does it neatly.  We see the last of the Esterhazys, and I cannot say I am sorry for that. While I agree with other reviews Ihave read of the Pendergast books that Constance is my least favorite character, I suspect because she is the least feasible, in this segment there is just enough of her and not too much to turn me off. I do wish shewould get on with thenext 140 years of her lifeand get rid of her below the knee pleated skirts.  Overall the storyline works, and while the'Lost Nazis in Brazil' is an overworked theme, these guys do a better job that most with it. And I have already preordered the next book in the Pendergast series.
B003157DTM|5.0|I ordered this for a very sick friend of mine and my daughter had one when she was little, it was identical<br />To the one she had back in the 70's!  My friend loved it because she collets monkey's<br />Love them item, thanks for making my friend happy and warm thoughts to me and my daughter!
B009YMNVMO|5.0|This is a great movie with songs and drama. It is very entertaining and fun.  We have watched it several times.
B005LAIIKI|4.0|I didn't want to see this movie for its historical accuracy or its relevant commentary on American slavery.  It's a Tarrantino movie! And one of his trademarks is violence so over-the-top that it's entertaining (as long as you don't take it too seriously).  His movies are also generally clever, and have memorable dialogue.  This movie is all of those things.  I deducted a star for DiCaprio's awful southern accent.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|It starts out good then grows to greatness with each listen.  It will one day be a classic. Love this.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Well acted, great cinematography. Incredible sequence of events for a true story.<br />It makes you wonder how they handseled the survivor remorse.
B008NW67E0|5.0|I just recently wrote the same about the Lumineers.  Each time you listen it gets better and better.  Great music.
B00BT0ZDF2|5.0|I don't even know where to begin with this movie. Perhaps that's the genius of the film. It's something you just can't put your finger on nor fully wrap your mind around. I've seen this movie about 7 times already, and each time I attempt to go in with an objective view. To stand outside of if it and analyze what I'm seeing. However, each time I can't help but immerse myself in what I'm seeing. In that way I think of it as more than a movie, but rather an experience. This is not a movie I ever want to analyze.<br /><br />I had the same experience as another reviewer on here who said it was one scene that nailed it for them as a masterpiece. The dishes scene is for me the greatest movie moment I have even seen. It left me deeply affected. When this movie first came out I seen it once a week in the theaters. During the week after each viewing that scene haunted me. I couldn't get it out of my mind.<br /><br />I also agree with the other reviewers who say each person gets something unique. I watched this with someone else, and they felt a lonely feeling after seeing the movie. As opposed to myself who felt a wonderful togetherness. While we both were very positive on the movie our emotional experience was completely different.<br /><br />One final thing. I'm obsessed this movie!
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|I can understand the negative reviews of this movie. It can be tough to follow as it bounces around between many characters, places and centuries. However, patience can be rewarded in this case.<br /><br />I found that although it is a long movie, I was never bored. Confused at times, but not bored. Reaching the end of the movie brought the plot lines together and reached a satisfying conclusion, sad as it was in some aspects.<br /><br />I think that this movie will probably be better-reviewed as the years go by and some day will reach a status as a major cult movie, if not a masterpiece.
B00A8MGIZG|3.0|Being an older person i found it very hard  to follow the story line, it jumps from one scene to another before you learn who the character is.  The effects and makeup are spectacular, and by the end of the movie i was finally able to identify who each character was during a different lifetime. I honestly cant say it was as enjoyable as i had hoped for. I believe this must be watched a few times to effectively follow the story line, especially by an older person.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I have other mahjong games on my Kindle Fire but I like this one best of them all.Very good game.
B00C9G22R2|4.0|I suppose being Bruce Lee's former teacher and someone who had made the martial art Wing Chun known around the world, the curiosity around his life became so strong that directors Wilson Yip and Herman Yau had their turn in bringing his life to the big screen. Wilson Yip's \\"Ip Man\\" was a film with a lot of fiction around it, which focused entirely on action sequences with Donnie Yen in the title role. Herman Yau's \\"The Legend is Born: Ip Man\\" was an unspectacular martial arts drama but a little more subtle and certainly not as bombastic as Wilson Yip's films.<br /><br />Well, finally the highly anticipated biopic about Ip Man directed by Wong Kar-Wai has finally arrived. A little different from his usual films, as the film goes for refreshing ideas and themes rather than decadent emotions, it is a film that has a lot of hype as with any other film directed by him. People should be aware that one needs to temper their expectations with Wong Kar-Wai's \\"The Grandmaster\\". It is a film about a true-to-life figure and is a period piece that brings the concept of how martial arts can apply to living. Wong Kar-Wai takes on a premise that he has not done before that his fans would have reason to celebrate. This review is based on the 130 minute film released in Asia, I have heard that another cut of the film was debuted internationally.<br /><br /> 1930s China. Ip Man (Tony Leung) is a rich, young martial arts master who does not want to compete and yet he finds himself thrust into the limelight as his peers push him into a sparring match with Chinese Martial Arts chairman Gong Yutian (Wang Qingxiang). The match was more technical than a display of skills as Ip Man asserts his inner skill to get the best of Yutian. As a result, Yutian's daughter, Gong Er (Zhang Ziyi)  who is also a master in her own right of the 64 hands, issues a challenge to Master Ip as to restore her family's reputation. The two spar in a flow of rhythmic movements that almost looked like poetry. This is only the first few minutes of the film, as Wong Kar-Wai co-wrote the screenplay to include certain periods in Ip Man's life. If life has four seasons, then the first 20 years is spring, but then his life takes a turn to winter during the Sino-Japanese war.<br /><br />Wong Kar-Wai intentionally made the film to feel rather convoluted and episodic. Perhaps in an effort to express his themes and metaphors, and to cover as much of Ip Man's life as best he could. Wong does not primarily takes his focus on Master Ip's life, but rather he brings into the fold the way each period was in his life and how certain people have influenced his life both directly and indirectly. The writing in the film was definitely trying to bring forth the concept as to how the teachings of martial arts could be applied to the living of one's life, as Tony Leung clearly elaborates in the first few minutes in the film; \\"It is all about the horizontal and the vertical\\". I take it that one is left standing while the other is laying down in martial arts. Such is something that could certainly be seen in life. One stands while the other lays down, perhaps one needs to learn how to lay down in order to stand, and also at a mirror image, one needs to learn to lay down in order to stand.<br /><br />Wong Kar-Wai has some rather heavy themes going around here. There is much to take in the film, the dialogue is often filled with philosophical meanings and metaphors, but we all know that it is usually what a Wong Kar-Wai movie is all about. The characters in the film move about its themes, and while its structure felt a little loose, the resonance for each of them is pretty crystal clear. Ma San (Zhang Jin) and Gong Er make choices that often feel that they were based on emotions such as pride, anger, honor and love. The theme of vengeance that comes with the two, was something that keeps them from fully reaching the peak of kung fu. This brings into its narrative as to there are three levels that signifythe highest achievement in martial arts: \\"being, knowing and doing.\\" This lesson comes from Master Gong to Ma San, and strongly expressed through Gong Er's life that she had taken a vow that kept her from becoming a wife and having children in order to avenge her father. Ma San and Gong Er chooses from a very straight-forward emotional level that chooses their destiny for them.<br /><br />Now, Master Ip also has potential for all these emotions, but he is more passive. His approach to life is a more peaceful one, as his love for Gong Er remained inside and that such a thing could not be in the past. Master Ip is married to Wing Sing (Song Hye-Kyo in a limited screen time) while Gong Er was engaged. Ip Man choose to rise above such desires and ambition, that he approaches life from a less than aggrandizing path. There is a subtle subversive message around its narrative, and yet it sees things from a humanist point of view. Life has its regrets, and yet, here, it is not something that drives its narrative but merely a consequence. Wong places the film's priorities on the world around the individual rather than what the individual does to the world.<br /><br />As with Wong Kar-wai's usual style, the film is very lush and a little pretentious. This is not a negative comment, but rather something that I have just grown to be fond of when it came to Wong's films. Wong uses slow-motion with overblown art direction and redolent details to bring the power, the beauty and the flair of the martial arts. All angles were utilized to display the moves and even some close ups to bring forth its effects and intensity. It is a true visual feast but I could've done without the `fighting in the rain' since it had been done so much in other films. The cinematography and the atmosphere of the film fit just should be expected of Wong Kar-Wai; this is after all a style all his own and what made him the renowned filmmaker that he is today.<br /><br />The screenplay in \\"The Grandmaster\\" is pretty strong, and yet it does not come with some issues. I mean, I know this is meant as a biopic, but one is left to wonder if this is Ip Man as seen through his eyes, or is it Master Ip as seen through Wong's viewpoint? I know the film's intentions was a less than fictional one, but really, it feels a little unfocused at times. The script takes some detours that I thought unnecessary, I was a little dumbfounded how a nationalist agent turned ass-kicking barber called \\"the Razor\\" could've made a good device to further Ip Man's transitions and yet he was only in three scenes. Chang Chen's the Razor was shamelessly used and felt like a `filler' since the film could've gotten along fine without him. I also thought that the narrative played a little too heavy on Zhang Ziyi's character rather than its supposed main protagonist.<br /><br />\\"The Grandmaster\\" could've easily been called \\"The Grandmasters\\" as in the plural form. It feels little unfocused to be a biopic on Master Ip, and truth be told, its messages could've easily been delivered in a film by any other director about a martial artist's journey experiencing the same things in the world. Tony Leung does a great job as the lead, as he felt a little smug and yet, tempered. Stoic, yet filled with emotions. His performance was certainly better than Donnie Yen's. It was also great to see Zhang Ziyi's to once again do her thing; she was elegant, beautiful and graceful as always. Despite some flaws, \\"The Grandmaster\\" is a good film that deals with devotion, humility and humanist ideas, and rather than using love as a driving force, it is a mere upshot.  It is about just what it means to stand upright, that how one chooses the right path is often the one left standing. This message is truly complete and grown-up that this film gets a High Recommendation from me.<br /><br />[4 ½ Out of 5 Stars]the highest achievement in martial arts: \\"being, knowing and doing.\\" This lesson comes from Master Gong to Ma San, and strongly expressed through Gong Er's life that she had taken a vow that kept her from becoming a wife and having children in order to avenge her father.

B001ANSSDC|5.0|Everyone should read this book even if they didn't like the movie. As usual, the movie doesn't even compare to the book.
B0052RE4MQ|3.0|Crossed falls into the exact same pattern as 90% of all trilogies out there. Maybe it is because, for some reason, I am in the middle of reading a load of 2nd books in a series, but I am growing weary of the same format for these stories. In book one Cassia falls in love with Ky and discovers that her seemingly ordered and happy existence is more complicated than she believes. In book two Ky has been torn away from her, so she spends the first half of the book separated from him. She is going to A LOT of trouble to find a way back to him, so it should be obvious that she is desperately in love with Ky, but for a good portion of this story she is finding herself thinking/dreaming of Xander, her official match. Ky is not secure enough in her feelings for him, so he takes time through the story to keep information from Cassia so that she doesn't leave him for Xander. And they wander. And wander. And wander. And wander. This is a filler book ... a book between the setup of the story that took place in Matched and the ultimate confrontation and conclusion of the story that will take place in Reached. For much of this story the characters are simply moving forward, every once in a while discovering an interesting tidbit of information. The characters spend so much time just moving and surviving. There is a new understanding about the history of Ky in particular, and there are a couple of new characters to mix things up, but I felt as if, ultimately, this book took a step away from the themes and emotion that really came out in Matched. It is still a nice story. It just didn't capture my imagination in quite the same way. Having said that, I do believe that there are important revelations in this story that will be important for the final book, so it is a necessary book to read for the series, and I am looking forward to reading the conclusion soon.<br /><br />Specifically, I missed the greater conflict between the Society its citizens. In Matched I thought it was interesting to see Cassia come to terms with new understanding. This Society, which always seemed to be so benevolent and ordered, actually had some bad undertones. Things were not as clear as they seemed to Cassia before her matching ceremony. Seeing her struggle between her friendship and love for Xander which was promoted and encouraged by the Society, and her growing love and attraction for Ky which was not condoned was so fascinating. In this book the Society only really exists as this phantom group of people who may or may not be flying over areas and taking out their own citizens. They were absolutely in every way evil. All of the sudden the gray areas were taken out of the story, and for me that made the story weaker.<br /><br />I also thought that the relationship between Ky and Cassia weakened as well. I wish that less time had been spent with the two of them separated. But, even when they are finally reunited, I felt like there was too much tension between them, and it was difficult to put a finger on what was causing it since both of them were keeping secrets from each other. This is a personal pet peeve of mine, so it may not bother everyone, but it drives me crazy when two people are supposedly madly in love, so much in love that they are willing to shove their fists in the face of the greater society, but they don't trust each other enough to come right out and SAY what they are feeling. Why is this? It cheapens their love on some level. I understand that Ky in particular has a difficult history, but I sure wish he could work things out openly with Cassia.<br /><br />I also missed Xander. He has one great scene in this story. Otherwise he is relegated to the background as Cassia and Xander think about him. That's it. And yet, suddenly it is almost as if there is now a love triangle in this story. I didn't feel that way in Matched, but I do with this story. Xander seems as if he has potential to be a great character because he may or may not be working againstthe Society, but he isn't doing it because of his love for a girl (at least I don't think so). Figuring out his motivations and what his role in this world will be could be so interesting. But in this book he only shows up for half a scene. I wanted more of him.<br /><br />Overall, this story is nice enough, but that is the best I can say about it. I liked it. I did. I think that the payoff for this series will occur in the last book though. I do recommend this book for fans of this series. Just hold off on any final judgments on the series as a whole until you complete the final book.

There were a few good parts, but way too many details that seemed to say the same thing over and over again.<br />The author could have/should have easily cut out at least 200 pages.

B000Y0Q5NM|3.0|I had the same problem with Buffy the Vampire Slayer in the first season (although the stories and characters were more original than StarGate). I can't help but compare it to Start Trek, and it falls short on every point: acting, originality of the stories, etc. ...<br /><br />However, the popularity of this show leads me to think I might need to give it a couple seasons before I make up my mind. I'm doing just that - giving myself time to get invested in the fate of the characters.

B009NG1Q96|4.0|Ok so if you read the first book it was OK, but it did not leave you in that point where you know if you are going to read the second book. But... the second part is a little more realistic, the prince is more like a normal guy and you get to see that everything will not be like America wants. It's better than the selection but if you didn't like the first book even a little bit then I don't recommend to keep on reading this one.

Other than that awesome!

I can just picture myself<br />being a part of Larkrise and Candleford.<br />The only negative is the character Dorcus whispers instead of talking<br />normally and I have trouble hearing her.

It may or may not sound crazy but I've been checking almost everyday to see if they have put this app on yet...and yes it's FINALLY HERE!!!This is a VERY addicting game.

0374531269|5.0|Second-hand accounts of wars and crimes against humanity tend to soften or brush over the harsh realities faced by real people.  Not so in this autobiographical account by Ishmael Beah, a boy from Sierra Leone who, at the age of twelve, was separated from his family and forced to wander to survive against the attacks of rebels.  With a straight-forward voice, Beah retells his experience in this poignant true story that would be a fantastic addition to any globalization class.  Larger issues of gender and globalization that we face today--the imperialistic structures of separate spheres, in which women are sheltered and men are the fighters, the widespread unrest in Africa and other formerly colonized areas after poorly-handled decolonization, and the conflict between global organizations such as UNICEF and a government's autonomy over its citizens--run through the background of this strikingly human narrative.  Overall, this is a great read that begs the question of what our role as humans is in regards to conflicts in this increasingly globalized society.
B004FGMDOQ|2.0|I only got halfway through this book because not only was it clearly an adolescent book when I found it in the adult mystery section but this book has already been written in a more entertaining way and that book is called X men.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was a story I really got lost in.  I was so impressed on how Ana described him sitting and playing the piano that I actually looked up Chopin's Prelude \\"Suffocation\\". It is on my Playlist. It is beautiful. I like that the book had a happy ending. I already recommended it to others. ALL 3 books get 5 stars from me. GOOD JOB... THANK YOU<br />SAUNDRANEWBILL
B009O07NMA|4.0|So you spend you day in an office, or more likely a cube or behind a counter.  You work long hours, get frustrated with all the daily grind issues of miscommunications, unhappy clients, unhappy bosses, and by the end of the day you want to tear your hair out for the frustration of it all.  Instead.....listen to this CD!  It is an uptempo, forget your a grown-up, escape CD that will make you forget your worries, and will take you to a place far away, where you are in your teens again, without a care in the world.  You'll be swaying and singing along while stuck in a traffic jam, reminiscing about your glory days.  Its full of lightheartedness, sex, booze, desire - all the things you wish would take center stage in your life, pushing off the number-crunching, paper-pushing, work-a-day doldrums.<br /><br />Overall the CD is great - there are a couple of songs that are a little too serious, and threatened to kill the mood, but then you get past them and it's all good again.  Go on....take a sip....don't stop.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is awesome I have it on my I pod and I really wanted it to be on my kindle and finally it's on here !!!:)&hellip;
B00CH87HF4|4.0|I really enjoy but the reviews are correct. When you get application, you are not done, another 750mbps need s to download before playing.<br /><br />As usual another app the is pay to get anywhere. Or just waiting everyday to get anywhere.<br /><br />Looks great on Kindle Fire and HD.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|I thought it was okay, but it wasn't the easiest to follow along to. I'll watch again and see if that works.
1476733953|1.0|I bought this book because of all the high ratings.  What a surprise how dull it was.  Never really got around to a point.
B00171EO0I|5.0|I saw this movie in theaters and absolutely fell in love with it. When I saw it on here, I bought it so that I could watch it whenever I want to.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Wow! What an ahhmazing book! I could (&& will) read this over and over and never get tired of it.
B0019I6WDG|5.0|I first saw this movie years ago and loved it, but I couldn't find it anywhere. So when I found it on here for about $3 renting, I jumped at the opportunity and watched it that day. I absolutely love the movie and want to purchase a physical copy eventually.
B00BC24NT4|5.0|George Smiley has retired, but his author, John Le Carre, has not. The British Foreign Ministry is at work again and so are slick criminels. This time it's a top secret operation on Gibralter that goes belly up. The consequencs effect its participants three years later. Beautifully written; elegantly plotted.  Best book I've read in years.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|There are lots of surprises in season three. Meanwhile, the high quality of writing and acting continues. A highlight is a visit to a Scottish branch of the family and the incredible beauty of the Highlands.
0989254607|5.0|I finally got my copy of this book. A friend of mine told me about it and I got intrigued. Ijust had to buy my own copy. And I have to say, I was happy that I got it. It was more than a great read. I was on the edge of my seat, noting that I started reading lying down. It was 3 in the morning and I was still reading. Needless to say it only took three sittings to read it. I'm a slow reader and this is fast paced. Go figure. I highly recomend it. To everyone who's afraid of spiders. I'm more afraid of them now. jaja.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Good action flick with some laugh out loud moments. Not a serious or historically correct movie, but hey, it's a movie. Some of the dialogue was laugh out loud funny. Well worth a rental. Very graphic violence . If you are squeamish about blood and such this isn't for you.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I am so sad this is the end of Sookie's journey. I think so of the reviews have been a little harsh. Harris did a great job of squaring away all of Sookie's loose ends. I wanted her to be with Eric but since she severed their metaphysical bond i knew that wasn't gonna happen. Plus, Sookie made it clear she never wanted to be turned. A twoey of some kind was the only real option. I don't think this was the best of the series but i gave it 5 stars because I feel that ,unlike some other supernatural series' authors, Harris ended it before it got to ridiculous. Its only so much you can cover with one POV character and I'm glad Sookie didn't amass a large arsenal of superhuman powers. Some people say Eric didn't put up enough fight for her but i believe he was true to his nature. He lived Sookie as much as he could but without her being willing to turn camp, why wouldn't he marry the Queen of Oklahoma? It was only logical.
B008602KQI|3.0|It was a decent movie, but not great in my opinion.  There simply was not enough of a set up as to why things were the way they were. Not enough character development, not enough background on the whole premise of the movie.
B00BHBBSZ2|4.0|This is a fun app once I learned how to use it.  I needed a note app to jot down quick lists and random thoughts with my fingers. Handrite Lite fits the bill.  The first time I tried it, I had chicken scratches on the screen. It didn't work well with a stylus either so I went back to using my finger.  This time, it seemed to have \\"learned\\" or adapted to my finger pressure and though my finger writing was neither even nor perfect, it was readable. The more I use it, the better I get at it though.  It took me bit of a while to find my way around and figure out how to use the different toolbars. There are a couple of buttons I'm not sure what they are for yet. This is where I would have liked to see a help or tutorial section come with the app.  I would like to be able to look for what I need instead of waiting for the right tip to show up when I open a new note.  I'm sure there are features yet to be discovered (by me) but so far, this app has been great for my intended purposes. That it saves my notes in the SD card is definitely a plus.
B007FDE4Y8|1.0|Four month ago I choose to buy your Opteka SteadyVid Pro, after some tests I realized the complexity of the adjustment don't came from the Steadicam physical principals itself ( dynamic and static balance ) but from the flaws in your design.<br /><br />It's possible to achieve a proper setup after a very long adjusting time, and get a short successful shoot done,  but if you make a small shake ( even with all the screws perfectly tighten ), the whole thing will go and will stay off balance.<br /><br />Put the Opteka SteadyVid Pro down, take it back up and it's completely lost again. It take at least 10 min, knowing what you do, to balance it back, and when you think it's balanced back, give it a small shake and it's lost again...<br /><br />Are Opteka trying to get sane and healthy people to kill themselves ?<br /><br />The design of the screw centering system is just a shame for the qualification of the engineer, but I'll be surprise if the designer even have qualification with steadicam principles or even basic knowledge of physic or mechanics.<br /><br />I'm a conceptor myself and I can tell this product is nothing more than a marketing attempt to target the low end of the videographers with a pale copy of the Steadicam Merlin ( overpriced but excellent ) with a construction quality absolutely outrageous. Folding a sheet of low quality steel with an loose hinge on what should be a super precise device is not only a shame, it's called stealing. Last time I heard a story like this it's was the cost cutting strategy  from the metallurgic engineers of the Titanic. You can pull the quality rope to a certain point to maximize short therm profit, and then it break. But believe me, It won't be painful only on one side...<br /><br />I guess the only goal of the Opteka SteadyVid Pro was to keep the production cost down, fake a real retail price at 599$, cut it down by 70% to attract the public, release a sponsored video review on youtube, still get a fat 80% margin from production cost and call it a day.<br /><br />But Opteka can't play this game anymore, with Internet, sooner or latter, lies and fake work fall under the spotlight and if no solutions are quickly founded, the reputation of the company will be stained. Sometimes for quite a while.<br /><br />I lost 4 days trying to get the SteadyVid Pro from Opteka to work properly, until I realized the whole design is screwed up from the roots. For comparation, a Steadicam Merlin took me less than 2min to adjust to achieve perfect and long lasting results.<br /><br />Asked for repair or refund from Opteka customer support, no news from them even the boss. Gain some time, Run away from this page and go for a Glidecam or a Merlin.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is one of the most compelling books that I have read in a long time.  I found the character development to have depth and attraction.  It will be my recommended read ..<br />Boca Raton, FL
B001V7P2MM|2.0|I guess that I am sorry to say that I am not too impressed with this collection of performances.<br /><br />A three day concert, and this is all they give us?  I appreciate many of the artists performing here, but I was disappointed with the songs they've done, while leaving out so many other more familiar recordings.<br /><br />\\"Work Me, Lord\\" from Big Brother and the Holding Company.  That's it? Nothing from Cheap Thrills and nothing of their more familiar recordings done before this performance?<br /><br />Jefferson Airplane. Nothing great from Surrealistic Pillow? I wasn't familiar with the songs they did do here. And there were many artists here that had more familiar recordings, but they weren't done here.<br /><br />The only thing that stood out for me here was Jimi Hendrix (though he didn't play \\"Foxey Lady\\"), and Santana doing \\"Soul Sacrifice.\\"<br /><br />Everything else, was just not anything special to me. A lot of easily forgettable performances.<br /><br />What's more, for being nearly four hours, they sure had a lot of unnecessary dialogue talking with people between performances.  And, a lot of that was just boring and unneeded.<br /><br />I took the BD back to the store and traded it for something else. At least, now, I can say that I watched it and I don't have to feel like the last person on earth whose never seen it.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app is great! I use it all the time. It reminds when your next alarm is on andyou can skip a day withouth having to turn the alarm off.
B00973DDN2|5.0|glad I bought it  going to see them again in concert this year  If you like high energy and good singing  you must see this band
B00992CF6W|5.0|Simple graphics for your creative side. It is fun to build your on worlds and then play online with your friends.
B002O2THRO|4.0|Very subtle and glamourous when compared to the loud over-the-top 2013 version... more like the way I envisioned the setting and characters Fitzgerald created.  These people had money and time to burn, yes, but that wasn't the focus of their lives.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Love this game it is addictive, I can not get my husband away from this. On a scale of 1-10 10 best its a 10 in my book.
B00CL50LEC|3.0|Okay-I bought this movie because my son wanted to see it when it was in theaters, but we didn't get a chance to go. I thought it was going to be really funny. It was okay. I wish I would have waited until I could rent instead of buy. However, my 14-year old son LOVED it! So I guess it depends on your age.
B00CC8789O|5.0|This VOD is completely AWESOME!!!!!! I personally cant see what was extended but its great to me. I love this series and this doesn't dissapoint. I bought all Fast & Furious movies VOD and they all look great. Straight to the KindleFire they went. As soon as Fadt6 is available ill purchase it VOD.<br /><br />This format is the only way I purchase movies. Thanks.
B0088W4YTK|5.0|Excellent viewing experience. Quality is great. All episodes are there to view .Great little synopsis before you actually click to watch . Outstanding series and instant prime is superb.
B004EPZ070|5.0|I love this movie I love the storyline it was great don't care what anybody says I love the movie was reallygoor
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|If you're new to Who, be prepared. Once you start, you're a fan for life. In this first season of the reboot the effects can be a little cheesy but that's part of the fun and Christopher Eccelson as the Doctor is just \\"fantastic\\".
B005LAIIHG|5.0|My fourth grade students are fascinated by this movie...I am heavily front loading plot, vocabulary etc. for them this first time as we go but plan to use it next year with lesson plans I might be able to find on the web.  It is chock full of  action and, of course, the animals are breathtaking...love it and so do the kids!
B006M4F67A|5.0|This is a great game for the Kindle Fire! The tiles are nicely sized, the action is smooth,  and there is a nice selection of tile layouts.
B0017HEYEI|1.0|I bought this DVD and went to return it and was told that it was past the 30 day period and was not able to return it. I should have at least received a credit. I will not be buying anymore DVD's. I bought this for a gift for an 84 year old woman so I did not know it was broken until she told me.
B008UWEFU6|5.0|fantastic books, fantastic transaction, time frame with the arrival and everything!!! Heard a lot of hype about the books, and can say that wow is it ever worthy to read. will keep this in my library for sure.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Enjoyable read. A quick glimpse into another great world of mr. Sanderson. Good characters and a good plot. Hope to see more
B005LW5J9O|3.0|Yes, the Lucretius poem was important but many other factors also contributed to the swerve---if not more than the poem as expoused in this book.  Wild Wanda
B009T8XBBO|4.0|This is an easy, rather cute game most appropriate for kids  Its pretty fun but not too challenging or strategic
0345529057|5.0|These books are a great read. I enjoy how George R. R. Martin creates the mood of the books.<br />It's worth the buy!
B00BN3EE1O|5.0|Movies such as this are a breath of fresh air. Particularly when they are based on novels by those with the literary magic of Nicholas Sparks. There's a dash of everything in this. Romance, drama, suspense, and there's even a surprise twist of the supernatural, but there's no over the top blood and guts & gratuitous violence that audiences have been programmed to cheer for. So of course you're going to have your eye rolls & sneers from a certain contingent, who will say that this is a candy coated chick flick. FAR from it. The addressal of the issue of domestic violence and the fear it creates is something that hit very close to home for me with this film. The entire cast owned their roles. Duhamel was perfect as the down to earth, vulnerable widower struggling to raise his children solo, following their Mother's tragic death. His guy next door charm & sex appeal is far from being unnatural or forced. He is not the stereotypical Handsome Hollywood Puppet. He is beautiful in a natural, everyman way. The complete package imo. And his chemistry with Hough sizzles. This is a woman who is a threat on every level. Singing, dancing, and now acting? She, too, is completely believable and so damn likeable throughout the entire movie. More than just a flawlessly gorgeous face, her every expression and interaction, whether solo, or in conjuction with the other characters is spot on. The children of Duhamel's character are two of the most realistic, natural talents I've seen in ages. I typically find myself annoyed by many over dramatic child actors. Not in this case! And even the villian of the film brings his own thunderbolts of talent. Never campy or cartoonish, he  chills me, because I KNOW that kind of man. And this is not a made for film only kind of performance he puts out. This was such a simple film that is saturated in reality, but I guarantee the surprise twist at the end takes an already stellar story and makes it magical. Realistic? Perhaps not, but a wonderful addition all the same to what is now one of my favorite movies. I wouldn't doubt if you immediatly go for another run through, just to \\"catch\\" what you might have missed the first time. I know I did. And I will again...and again...with the copy I just ordered.
193700788X|5.0|I felt this book was a good end to the series and wish all those who are so angry and hateful towards the author need to remember that though we may love the characters their fates are not ours to dictate.<br /><br />**Edit**<br />In response to those who have so politely responded to my review, please see my amended review in the comments section.<br /><br />**2nd Edit**<br />Also, this is my first review because if I'm going to review a book I tell people about it, in person.... face to face... you know, like we did back in the dark ages.....<br /><br />**3rd Edit**<br />And looking back, it isn't my first Amazon review... I've reviewed a couple (possibly only one) Kindle app.
B00BN3DPQ4|5.0|My husband and I saw this movie at the theater. We Loved it.  The theater was almost empty but the couple of dozen of folks there applauded at the end of the movie.  I don't know why it wasn't a bigger hit, maybe because of Arnold's recent problems. The movie was funny, full of lots of action, had a great cast, a couple of hilarious sub plots, a pretty good story line, and because we live in Arizona the topic of the story is something that is a big concern to the folks who live in Southern Arizona. It was nice to get a chance to laugh at this serious situation for once. It was plain nice to leave a movie feeling good (some movies nowadays leave you wondering why you spent the money).  This movie is well worth either renting or adding to your home movie library.
0061122416|5.0|When I ordered it, my intentions was to order it in Espanol. So now I have it in both English and Spanish. lol
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Michael Chiklis is amazing, he portrays both the good cop and bad all by himself, hard to dislike his character although we know we should. Great cast, exciting series. Watch it you'll be glad you did
0062511408|5.0|Lyendo esta libro en espanol ha ayudanome en la lengua mucho.  Y el historia es bueno tambien muy intresante.<br /><br />Gracias.
B00AEFXJ86|5.0|I have read a lot of negative reviews about this movie and I could not disagree more. On the first hand what's not to like about a movie  with Samuel.Secondly I have become a huge fan of Christina Ricci's work. I recently purchased several of her films and I was happy with everyone of them. I would say that you should give this film a chance and if you do, look into viewing several of her other movies. I think you will be greatly surprised and pleased.
B009EHDU7U|4.0|It was a fun read. Last three chapters of the book tied up a bit too perfectly at the end though.
B009R659L8|5.0|I love to read, so I try to pick books that really hold my interest.  I have always been a fan of  Mary Higgins Clark.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Terrible writing. Legitimately the worst writing, other than maybe the Twilight series, I've come across in a long, long time. But if your sex life is extremely \\"vanilla,\\" maybe this book will help you to cook up some more ideas. But overall, the book is a cheap fix for feeble minded women who want cheap thrills. Yawn.
0739352989|5.0|Wow couldn't stop listening!!! Was everything I was expecting and then some. Definitely recomemd listening with a friend or partner.....
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Great movie, worth seeing it many times over. Very cleaver way to get hostages out of a sticky situation. Thumbs up
B008XG1X18|5.0|1Word. #obsessed. This app is so helpful and organized. It's perfect! I'd say it's better than instagram' (: Just my opinion, though.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|Photos are blurry and grainy. Wish I did not purchase. You do not have to buy to access your camera. STINKS.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|In spite of friends recommendations, I did not enjoy this book very much.  It was too repetitive and rather boring.  I kept waiting for the \\"good part\\" to start.
B0096HIEE2|5.0|I have to be honest. I have no idea what this movie is about! I just really like to look at this movie and my mind just wanders.... Good thing I purchased it because I can watch it again and again until something sinks in. Or not.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I first read it for a science fiction course in ninth grade, but still almost 10 years later I still read it. This is one of my favorite books and hopefully my son will enjoy this book too. ENDERS GAME depicts how the world would prepare for its  supposed salvation under extenuating circumstances, and how the resulting costs weigh on the innocent; a book that is insightful towards empathy yet realistic to human natures tendencies.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|it is a grate app but it has 1 mager flaw sometimes it will restart adowmadickly. did this to me 2times.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Victoria's journey is beautiful in its commonality to our own lives: fear, growth, and trust.  I loved the use of flowers as their own language.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I have to defend Charlaine Harris.  Dead Ever After is in my opinion, far better than the last couple of Sookie Stackhouse books.  The plot's pretty complicated, and I loved seeing old favorites like Diantha come back (I really hope Diantha makes it into the TV series). I would have loved to have seen more of Pam in the story though.  To me, Eric's behavior was right in character with how he's been portrayed all along: he couldn't get out of the marriage because of his maker's agreement, but the marriage did give him power without having to be king himself, which he didn't want.  Also, he did try to keep Sookie as his mistress, so it's not like he was abandoning her.  Ultimately, there was no way Sookie would be able to have a future with any vampire without being turned, which she did not want to do.  So, ending up with a human was the only logical thing to do.  The only problem with Sam is that so far, he had been portrayed as Sookie's friend, so the readers were not really given the chance to see him as a possible romantic interest.  Alcide and Quinn yes, but Sam, no.  All in all, I have to say this is a good book, and I'm going to miss the series.
B00CRR5YA0|5.0|Star Trek films for the most part have had great music.  Into Darkness continues this tradition.  Please listen to the greatness.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Loved this book!  It speaks to the emotions of love on so many different levels.  I also loved the reference to the meaning of flowers which was an added bonus.
0694003611|5.0|Great book for helping to put your baby to sleep.  It has a lot of &#34;sh&#34; words and a nice lilting rhythm to recite.  Recommend for the go-to-sleep nighttime ritual.

067144901X|5.0|My son can't get enough of this silly book.  I plan to buy more of Boynton's books in the future.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|it is a great series I've watched all 8 seasons it almost jumped the shark in season I think 6 when it was the fairies but it has come back in season 8 gonna hate it when it is done
B005EGXTEE|5.0|read all the books loved them all. watched the first movie .waiting for follow up movies.good light reading.waiting too long for movies to follow.
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|its a good game except the shark does not swim easily it has a tendency to float into explosive items and stop swimming
B007B5EDEG|4.0|still reading.looking foward to tv series.hard to keep track of relationships as there are so many caricters.but a real good read
B0019X3YXM|5.0|Before I saw this movie, my friends kept telling me, &#34;You HAVE to see it! It's SO good!&#34; Finally, I did. At first, even though I enjoyed the movie, I couldn't understand why they were so emphatic about it. It is kind of an odd and quirky love story, and I liked that it was unusual and not the typical rom-com. By the end of the movie, I was hooked!
0062068415|3.0|This was a very good thriller from Dennis Lehane, and as always he delivers.  Now i need to see the movie.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I loved this Movie, I felt right in it , it was emotional, great acting, the singing is so natural . The story of this movie captured me into that era of time . It was a long movie
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|when I saw this available in the android app store I didn't even hesitate to download this game. I have a kindle fire so I was unable to play this game for a while. and fortunately ot runs smoothly on aneroid devices as well. don't wait to get this game, why would you its free!
B005LAIIHG|3.0|I thought it was too drawn out at the beginning trying to get my mind into it . The animal at the beginning did not make sense. The ending finally explained this. This Film is only suitable for a mature mind
B00821P6OY|4.0|Good show with a believable storyline. Love the family bond that you get with the lead character and his sons. I can't wait to see them develop as the season continues. Definitely worth watching.
B000PMG16U|5.0|Star Wars on Blu-ray. .....? No brainer!
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Season 10 and the show is still rock solid in story content, plot development. A win-win for any and all  viewer.
B00CL50KDY|5.0|It's such a great twist on your typical zombie theme. Loved it in the theater and love it on my Amazon Instant Video.
B004L35GAQ|3.0|I got hooked on AWOLNation with the song \\"Kill Your Heroes\\" so when I had the chance to pick it up, I did.<br /><br />I have a tendency to buy a CD just for one song, because I often enjoy digging deeper into a CD to see what a band is truly made of.<br /><br />Overall, the CD did not completely disappoint. While the radio mainstays \\"Sail\\" and \\"Kill Your Heroes\\" were expertly done, the rest of the CD was a bit more hit and miss, in that the concept they were trying to deliver (religion I'm guessing) is a tough one to conquer.<br /><br />The only track that really disappointed me was the 15+ minute opus called \\"Knights of Shame\\". Not sure what they were trying to do, but normally a track like this is usually found on a geezer rock band's live album (think \\"Dazed & Confused\\" or \\"Whipping Post\\", both of which take up one whole side of the album), not on a studio album. The track would've been better served at having 11 minutes sliced off of it.<br /><br />AWOLNation's self titled CD gets three stars up above and a 1/4 star in this review.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|This is a really fun game and the Dino's are really cool. It is actually kind of educational for kids since it shows the name of each Dino and a brief description when each is purchased. However the game slows a bit at later stages cause of larger costs of some of the item but u can make money pretty quickly if u play it regularly. Also the missions r very plentiful and give a good rewards. The only thing that I don't like is Facebook interface. I don't have Facebook (yeah I know I am a strange) so I can't access my game from different devices and basically play as guest. But overall a pretty good game.
B003F1WM2K|4.0|I enjoyed reading the friendship between Patti & Robert. I love the talent that they possessed and also the generation and the people that swirled around them. I grew up reading about Andy Warhol, Janis Joplin & Jimi Hendrix etc. Patti Smith brought those memories back.
B0096CDG0O|3.0|Have a new Samsung Note II and the paid app has issues. Easy to accidentally start a game with a random &#34;buddy&#34;, attempt to re-match a buddy it seems to lock up or doesn't flip to the next screen so you try again and now have two new games going.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Very enjoyable. The storyline is good. Graphics are great. I like the combination of mystery, hidden objects and adventure. I am very glad I got this one.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|What a great premise for a series. Love that it is a fresh, interesting, thriller. Can't wait for each episode.
B008TVLRU4|5.0|the link between the Stoic philosophers and Zen Buddhist monks has never been clearer...words of wisdom from a great Roman Emperor!-)
1469273772|5.0|I haven't listened to the book yet but the disc is in great condition.  I've read the book and it is Tom Clancy writing about Jack Ryan and the gang.  The book is great.
B0017QSZW6|5.0|While I found Season 2 of The Tudors not quite as compelling as Season 1, I can't bring myself to give it any but the highest rating.  I have not read critical reviews of this series, but it would not surprise me to find critics who have nothing or little good to say about it, because the characters often seem a little silly, the historical inaccuracies are probably rife, and I suspect the production quality does not live up to the highest hopes of the art director(s).  Furthermore, I don't delude myself that watching this series is any sort of substitute for learning about the reign of Henry VIII, but here's what I know:  I am for the first time in my long life interested in reading about the Tudors, the true character of Henry VIII, and the breakdown of relations between England and Rome.  Speaking of Henry, Jonathan Rhys Meyers did not impress me in Season 1, but he grows into this role, gradually giving us a ruler.  It's a fascinating transformation.
B002ZG999U|5.0|This was a gift for my husband because he loves action movies.  We had just seen Expendables 2 at the theater so wanted to see number 1.  Found it on Amazon at a great price.  Husband loves the movie which has become a part of his action movies collection.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|This is the most perfect love story I've ever read. Eleanor and Park are the most quirky, perfect characters. I'm in love with this story.

B0041KKYEM|1.0|this such trush it should not be sold.  It sure was not what I thought it would be.  just plain crazy!
B006BGZJJ4|3.0|I wear through these cables at the rate of about one every six months. I've given up on third party solutions -- haven't found one that lasts as long as the original Amazon version. Still too fragile around the Kindle end. Wires become exposed, then break (or worse, short). I've finally just started keeping a couple of spares on-hand. It's cheaper than replacing the Kindle -- still my favorite reader (although starting to show its processor limits with large book counts).
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Great movie, great message, my son loves it.  Movie arrived quickly and was in really good condition.  We will watch this one over and over!
B00190N4E4|5.0|Great movie, broke it into two showings.  Was the history of Gandhi but also a history lesson in and of itself on India.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Haven't played a lot of it but what I did I enjoyed.  First few games were easy but they have gotten harder as I go.
0670026638|5.0|Have been waiting for a Ruth Ozeki book for 12 years and so excited to read this wonderful tale. Once again she's amazing....
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|From my wife Sarah: I've been a fan of Star Trek since the first series. This movie was excellent.<br /><br />Here's why:<br /><br />- The story was engaging, exciting, and had plenty of edge of your seat moments.<br /><br />- The way it wove the new story together using prior movie and TV themes to build on was kind of genius. Those who know Star Trek will enjoy that.<br /><br />- It had humor with a few good laughs and chuckles, but it also brought tears to my eyes.<br /><br />- I loved the way they developed the relationships between the main characters, especially between Spock and Kirk. I very much disagree with the poster who said there wasn't enough character development. I felt it was quite the opposite.<br /><br />- There were surprises. Especially one big one, which I won't reveal. I enjoyed that this movie wasn't predictable.<br /><br />- The casting was spot on. It's so believable that these are the young versions of Spock, Kirk, etc.<br /><br />- The acting was superb.<br /><br />What else can you want!<br /><br />I saw it at an IMAX 3-D theater, and I'd highly recommend that. The 3-D was phenomenal on this huge screen. There were moments when I could imagine I was in space.<br /><br />I think that Star Trek fans, as well as those who are new to Star Trek, will enjoy the movie. You really don't have to know Star Trek history to enjoy this movie, but if you are familiar, you'll get a lot more out of it.<br /><br />So Star Trek fans shouldn't miss this new addition. I also recommend this movie to all scifi and action fans. I'll be purchasing this movie when it becomes available, and I'm sure I'll watch it many times.
B005544V6A|5.0|SUITS has a quirky premise in a familiar setting, a law firm, but it's the characters that make it special.  Harvey Specter is the coolest customer on TV, and the rest of the Pearson Hardman gang is just as fun and fascinating. Their interactions drive the series and make each episode worth watching over and over. I just love Donna and her command of office politics, Mike and his struggles between his shady past and just slightly less questionable present, the awesomely slimy Louis Litt, and the regal, tough-as-nails Jessica.  I have seen every episode at least twice and still was thrilled when they became available on Amazon Prime so I could watch them all over again!!  Have fun and watch SUITS from the beginning...and don't forget the can opener and thumbtacks!!
B005I3PAUO|4.0|Find that John Puller's character is a little too one dimensional, almost too perfect in terms of his discipline, mental and physical prowess. He may become a little more plausible if in other stories we share in some of his weaknesses that his humanity must envelope as well.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I enjoy reading Brown's books an the symbolism within each of them.  This book in particular has a double ending with excellent detail of the main them.
B005IQZB14|4.0|This is the Cheryl worth reading these days if you want to explore the inner and out outer strength of women. Cheryl Strayed is authentic, unafraid to share herself and her experiences and writes really well. She 'leans in' and rocks on as she trecks the PCT and the bumpy road of her life before the trip. The story is a very relatable personal journey even if you only have few life experiences in common. Truly enjoyable. I wish she was in my circle of friends. I'd bet she is wonderful to spend time with.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book--it was well written and an interesting take on the zombie genre.  Seeing the same story from so many perspectives was refreshing and didn't feel disjointed or chaotic as I had feared it would.  It flowed naturally and told each \\"stage\\" of the war nicely, without getting redundant.<br /><br />My only real complaint is not with the book itself but with the Kindle functionality.  This book has a lot of footnotes on terms that need explaining, and these are all compiled at the end of the book.  I really wish that Kindle had a way to quick access the Notes/Glossary at the end of the book simply by clicking on a note.  Instead, each time I came upon one I had to decide whether it was worth it to pause my reading and flip through the entire book to look up the term.  While this isn't a deal breaker, it is really inconvenient, and certainly much more so than reading a physical copy of the book.  Kindle, please add this functionality to allow for easier reading of books such as this one!!!
B00CDXOXB4|4.0|Beautiful and clean movie.  A little of violence, but still is a good movie,  I would recommend this movie to my friends
B008PALH0E|5.0|The Hughes H-4 Hercules was a heavy transport aircraft built by Hughes Aircraft. The aircraft made its first and only flight on November 2, 1947. Built from wood because of wartime restrictions on the use of aluminum, its critics nicknamed it the \\"Spruce Goose.\\" It is the largest flying boat ever built and has the largest wingspan of any aircraft in history. In fact, it was too big to fly. Likewise, the SST Concorde, which flew well but was too big to fly commercially. And then there were the ships: the Vasa, a Swedish warship built in 1626-1628, which sank after sailing less than 2 km on its maiden voyage, and the Great Eastern, an English paddlewheel built in the 1850s, 692 feet long and too big to be docked in any port in the world.<br /><br />Mahler's Symphony 8 is too big to fly or float. At best it can 'process' grandly, like a holy relic borne between enemy armies to avow the Peace of God. At worst, it wallows and lists in its own wake until its brass cannons break their lashes and the whole gaudy Gargantua sinks. I've heard it live, I've heard it on LPs and CDs and now on this DVD, and frankly I don't think \\"heard\\" is the right word. It can't be heard; it can only be experienced. Many people find that experience exhilarating. I'm not one of them, though the sight of more than a thousand young choristers responding to the hands and face of conductor Gustavo Dudamel is impressive. This performance is indeed a triumph, not of Mahler's music but of El Sistema, the Venezuelan program that offers free musical training to over 400,000 youths. Dudamel is himself a product of El Sistema.<br /><br />Don't take my 5-star rating as an endorsement of the music, or the performance, or the audio engineering! It would not be worth \\"hearing\\" without \\"seeing.\\" The choir outbellows the orchestra whenever it's summoned forth, despite the fact that the instruments number in the hundreds, combining the LA Philharmonic and the Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var Symphony. Alas, 'we' should have been there; recording technology couldn't possibly capture the details of such a performance. And you can't evaluate Dudamel's interpretation of the symphony per se on the basis of what you can't really hear.<br /><br />Let's imagine a performance for recording of Symphony 8 , with severely reduced forces. One instrument per part and a chorus of sixteen. What inner musical splendors would you hear? Or are there such splendors? I for one haven't heard them yet on any of the existing recordings.<br /><br />But I have grave doubts about whether the Symphony of a Thousand can ever \\"fly.\\" It's heavier than air, and air is what carries sound waves. It's an evolutionary end-product like the brontosaur, the giant ground sloth, or the California condor -- majestic but cumbrous. Or like one of the great engineering failures of human history: the Tower of Babel, the Siena cathedral of 1339, the Anthaeum Conservatory of Sussex in the 1830s, or the Three Gorges Dam in modern China, all of them too big and too ambitious ... unless you consider human ambition to be its own reward.there; recording technology couldn't possibly capture the details of such a performance.

B003U4ZQRK|4.0|I thought this was an interesting show.  I spent a lot of time being lost, like the characters.  The show skips around in time a lot, and so do the characters, making it somewhat confusing at times.  But this keeps it interesting to me.  But then, I like science fiction and some fantasy books.<br /><br />The characters are pretty interesting, and I never got bored.  Thanks to Amazon Prime, I watched the series straight through within about a month or two.
B0055OG2BC|5.0|This movie is a misunderstood classic. It makes sense as part of a psychedelic trip. I believe that's what the creators intended it to be seen as and in that it also really works very well. Another good movie in the same mould would be \\"the party\\", also with peter sellers.
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|I think this is the first English book that I read from beginning till the end.<br />And I finished it in less than 3 days.
B00371XIJE|5.0|One thing stands out \\"never forget the people whom you loved once\\". One movie that reminds of the core principle of our existence...
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Great book. Took me a long time to finish it but definitely worth the read. Victor Hugo has a style that continues to keep me coming back.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|For those who've read the novel, it's not the same -- but then again, when is it?  However, the movie is it's own medium, and recreates the experience viscerally, and I recommend you see it. For those who have not read the book, the movie is a must-see. You will not be disappointed with its journey and the metaphors are just as Biblical as they are literary.
B0043VDIAG|2.0|Followed a formula, not interesting at all. Could not wait to finish, and only read it for book club, unfortunately.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Perfect size and the best is that it works well with all Kindle products! May be an assessory but everyone shouls have it!
B005GFPZYK|4.0|I am so glad I read this book. It was a hard read, and not a job I would ever want to do, but it certainly makes me understand the actions of armed personnel.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I have read all of Mitch Albom's books. i chose this book as I wanted to complete my experience reading his books. Don't think anyone who has read his previous books would not like this one!
1400069807|5.0|An inside look into what is making us fat, lazy and stupid...ier.  A must read for every socially conscience American.
B000FC13E0|5.0|This is my all time favorite movie.  I think I've read it 5 times and will keep on reading it.  Why hasn't Steven Spielberg made a movie from this book.  It will keep you reading.....not wanting to put it down....till the last page.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I did not expect to like this game as much as I did, but wow am I glad I got it. Totally worth the money, I have yet to find another game like it. Graphics were awesome and the actual gameplay was smooth all throughout. I was so hooked I can't wait for the next one.
B001EC2J20|3.0|it was a decent movie, if you haven't seen it then it wouldn't be a complete waste of time.  But i bought it for just that
1905492073|5.0|Explains deco theory in detail but in language that an experienced trained diver can understand. Worth buying for any diver making or contemplating decompression diving.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Fun but short...wish there were more levels. Excellent graphics and cool look. I hope there is a sequel to this one.
B007D5E7C2|5.0|great movie. well done and acted can't beat for money. Thought kill bill 2 was a little slow but still a very good film
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|I've always said making A prequal of A previsa movie is most of the time A waste of money and effort.Prometheus should of been made before alien and all its sequals,I mean the special effects were good the acting alright,but some body did not the orginal alien because there where some differences in this one .
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Great graphic s takes a long time to load but we'll worth the wait.  As you get further into the game it does get a little more difficult but that is what keeps you coming back for more!
B0080CKGZE|1.0|Did not like this at all.  The story line was lame and it must have been early in Robert Pattinson's career.  I was reluctant to give it one star
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Loads of fun.. Playrix makes quality beautiful games that I return to again and again.<br />Great job! Relaxing gameplay and always a nice soundtrack that doesnt get annoying
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|OK folks first of all, this is a movie.  J.J. is not trying to re-invent the wheel here. What J.J. Abrams has accomplished here is to re-imagine a burned out brand and series (that I loved as much as any true fan) and  had the guts to go where no director has gone before with it.  He shows his total respect for the best of the previously done films, his respect for the fans of the original films, and bravely creates a marvelous environment for the future of this series.  I cannot tell you the last time I have sit in a darkened movie theater (full of fans and first timers) and had so much fun listening to the audience ooh and aah at what they were seeing and hearing from the screen. I along with them laughed, oohed, aah-ed, and even shed a tear, as this movie unfolded, and cannot remember the last time I felt so satisfied in seeing a film.<br /><br />  To all of the families with teens and tweens out there, Yes! this is the whole family movie experience you've been waiting for (and to be fair, there are some really intense scenes, and a four letter word uttered, but you just know the character would really say it in the heat of the moment) !!! It Is Fun! The cast is pitch perfect, the look, sound, and feel of \\"Into Darkness\\" is a joy to behold, and a loving homage to all of us who loved the original characters and films, and to those of us who just love good old fashion science fiction. It is a first class roller coaster ride and a true challenge to film makers to up the ante for audiences, if you want us to continue to shell out the movie bucks. By the way, this is a repeater for me as I will go back to see it again.<br /><br />To J.J. Abrams and your entire crew, Thank You! for being so fearless, so brave to tweak and tamper with a sci-fi original, and re-remind me why I like to go to the movies. I think that Gene Roddenberry would be so proud of your take on his universe.<br /><br />To the entire cast, Thank You! for being true to the original actors and characters, for giving them your spin, and making the roles your own. I have not had this much fun in a movie theater in a long, long, time, and in a galaxy far, far, away.  BRAVO !!!<br /><br />And to those of you that are leaving such horrid and negative comments to my review, WAKE UP!!  These are MOVIES that we are talking about.  I now understand why some actors  comment at some point in their careers,  about some fans needing to get a life.  Movies are not real life changing events.  They are meant for ALL of us to ENJOY (or not)for the two or three hours we sit in that theater, and maybe learn a little something  (or not).  Movies allow us to escape our sometimes droll and stressful lives for just a moment, to fantasize, to dream for a moment, to forget how different our lives have become.  If you don't like or feel the same  way about a movie as I do, I understand.  But understand this, I don't try to keep people from seeing, renting, or buying a film because I don't like it, nor do I spend my time trying to drag someone else down because their opinion is different from mine.<br /><br />I saw this film and I had Fun!! It took me back to the early days of Bart Sloane (The 4D Man - The Blob), Ray Harryhausen (Jason and the Argonauts), and Stanley Kubrick (2001: A Space Odyssey) when special effects were in their infancy.  I felt the same way when I saw my first Steven Spielberg film (Jaws), my first Ridley Scott movie (Alien), George Lucas (Star Wars), and now J.J. Abrams.  These are but a minute few of the hundreds of great filmmakers (I could go on forever)that have gone the extra mile to entertain us, to give us a break from the real world that is so full of Intolerance, Hate, Fear, Hunger, Struggle, and Disease.  Give them a break guy's, they are just making movies for us to enjoy (or not).<br /><br />Remember, the world will still turn tomorrow, that is unless God decides that he has had enough of us, and the way we treat each other, and decides to just shake us off of this little blue planet that some of us do not appreciate or respect at all.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|Once it was rolling along, this one was a good read. It just takes so long, George, why can't you move things along a bit better?
B0096BIENY|5.0|This is a great CD. I love their music. I look forward to some more CDs like this one so
0307352153|5.0|I've already read it twice. It spoke to me so clearly. Susan Cain has superbly researched the personality trait called introversion, argues why it is so underrated and even stigmatized, and makes the case for the gifts that introverts bring to society's table.<br />'Nuff said.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|This is a great CD. I love their music. I look forward to some more CDs like this one so
B0000DD79B|5.0|The best of Rhymin Simon and Art Garfunkel before they split for good. Some of the best music I listened to growing up in the 70s. If you like the Beatles, Elton John, Billy Joel etc., this one fits right into your collection.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|This is a great CD. I love their music. I look forward to some more CDs like this one so
1476734941|5.0|I have lost 15 lbs in a month and fasting is not that bad as they allow you 600 cal on a fast day.
B004XWMXW4|5.0|This is a great CD. I love their music. I look forward to some more CDs like this one so
B00B2YH7BS|5.0|It was very entertaining. To see the history of sound city and the bands that recorded there was really impressive. Not to mention the little things you learn about the studio and what made it unique. Then dave grohl gets former artist who have recorded there and makes an album which is great. I would recomend this to anybody who loves rock n roll.
B0000CFW87|5.0|This is a great CD. I love their music. I look forward to some more CDs like this one so
B0027MJU00|5.0|This is the first book of Gillian's I've read. I loved the characters, even the ones I hated. Everyone was at the least interesting and definitely not vanilla. The story is a prime example of how lies, being misunderstood, and laziness can shape your life. I also actually liked the main character Libby. I thought the way Gillian wrote her made her someone you definitely wanted to root for and she provided comedic relief, even at things you shouldn't laugh at. I will definitely read another Gillian book.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|This is a great CD. I love their music. I look forward to some more CDs like this one so
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I'm always surprised how each season is better than the last. Excellent actors and great storylines. Can't wait for season 5.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This is a great CD. I love their music. I look forward to some more CDs like this one so
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I was never able to catch this show when it aired and I'm so happy that I am able to catch up on the seasons through Amazon Prime. Keep these great shows coming!
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|This is a great CD. I love their music. I look forward to some more CDs like this one so
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game keeps me occupied and I can stay focused on this and not on my brothers!!!- :-) get this game peeps and do u know the BEST part? IT'S FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I give this book 5 stars because of the storyline. It captures you and brings you into the characters messed up world. By the second chapter to fully understand that the main character has a specific purpose. After you get that you and this book will be inseparable. I read it in 2 1/2 days and i do not regret zipping through it so fast because it was interesting. I took away a star because some pages and chapters were kind of slow although they were needed. I wish Quick would have re thought the format of some of the later chapters. Besides that the book was stellar and I recommend it to all.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was very well written and I didn't expect the end to end the way it did. One thing I really like about this book it wasn't predictable and its pretty realistic and I absolutely loved it.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This series was very different from everything else I have ever read.  Although it seemed ridiculous at times, I couldn't stop reading it.
B002WIDRM6|5.0|liked all the songs - a first for me!  If you like Lady Antibellum's music this is a good album.
B0015AARJI|5.0|I purchased this controller because the last one I purchased only lasted a few months and was light and horrible. This new one from Sony is perfect. It was delievered earlier than expected and the controller works great
1591791707|5.0|this book has really changed my life. It's grounded, sensible, compassionate direction on how to make your life and the life of people around you more wonderful. I've shared it with many people and will continue to share it with others, it's so terrific.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|This book series is excellent, and the final book is the best!  A must read!!!  If you like fantasy books this series can't be beat!!!
0375842209|5.0|4.9 Stars<br /><br />I loved everything about this book.  The writing is so fresh and clear it makes me smile repeatedly despite the grim narrator and subject matter as serious as death itself (pun intended).<br /><br />Not only is it interesting, it is important.  Highly recommended.
193700788X|1.0|I have to agree with the many other reviews that the change in POV, inconsistencies and her choice for her HEA are not in line with anything from earlier books.  Her dismissal and lack of emotion over Eric is not believable.  I agree that Harris seems to have been done with SVA since True Blood came out.  Wish I had bought it at a brick and mortar store so I could have returned it.  Like others have suggested I will pretend the series ended at 12.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This game is so awesome! I love that it's based on perry( pretty much the best character on the show)the levels are challenging yet so fun. Its so worth the 99 cents.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Great game, Bought it with the 500 coins that amazon gave it to me a few days ago, it's a nice game
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Another phenomenal book I can't wait to let my mind escape into that world again I can wait until technology truly let's us enter books so we can practically live it
B00881PTRC|5.0|Great game, Bought it with the 500 coins that amazon gave it to me a few days ago, it's a nice game
B008GXHOFW|5.0|I gotta give these creators some credit. This is a very good game that  keeps you entertained. There are various fights going on at all times so you can beat some thugs and stay entertained. You can explore the whole city and take a break from everything by just slinging around the city. The graphics are iffy, but still, this is great!
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Great game, Bbought it with the 500 coins that amazon gave it to me a few days ago, it's a nice game
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Usually, it takes a lot for me to get so emotional while I'm reading a book. It's VERY sad sometimes, but i never cried... i just got really angry at some parts. I thought it was amazing that Garth Stein could bring out that anger inside me.<br /><br />One of the saddest parts was the part where Denny saw Annika in the coffee shop. (Don't worry, i won't spoil anything for anybody). Enzo finally concluded at the end of the chapter that Denny didn't do anything mean because he's a gentleman. That part reminded me of my grandpa soo much. Actually, the character of Denny reminds me a LOT of my grandpa, because even when things get him down, he can still overcome the obstacles when we think we can.<br /><br />This book is from the perception of the dog and his opinions. It goes to show you that sometimes, a dog knows a whole lot more than a man does.
B0061PEAUY|3.0|This book has a great plot but it moves very very slow. I expected better from this well known author.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game brings your world to life. you make your world how you want it make houses mansions underground house tree houses and portals
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Only part of this game is free but I knew that going in so I wasn't bothered. I really liked it and downloaded the full version. And it doesn't cost much. I had to use the hint button a lot at times but I really liked the game. I like the storyline, the hidden object scenes and the puzzles. A good combination of things to keep your attention. I had a hard time putting it down. When I got to the rock with the runes on it, I had a problem. You are supposed to touch the runes in a certain order to solve the puzzle and open a hole in the ground. I touched them in random order before realizing I needed to do it in a certain order and all the runes lit up but the hole didn't open. I've tried over and over and over putting in the proper sequence and nothing happens. I went to their website and posted the problem on a blog and there are several other people on there with the same problem. I wouldn't say you shouldn't buy the game, but I would say that if you do, make sure when you get to that part, you do it right the first time or you might not get to play the rest of the game. I don't know for certain if it would have worked if I'd done it right the first time or if it would have gotten stuck anyway. I still really love the game and hope I can find a way to solve this and play the rest of it.Update: I figured out how to start over the game and when I got to the rune puzzle, I made sure I did it right the first time and it worked and I was able to finish the game without any more trouble. Loved it!
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|I usually get sick of a show by the third year...not so with NCIS.  All involved in its production deliver great stories, fascinating characters, and all you could want in a show.  Bravo!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Makes you realize that you shouldn't wish your life away, but rather slow down and stop the busyness and savour every minute of every day.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|Standard Usb cord. Didn't pay anything, customer service  sent it tm me free when my kindle wouldn't take charge but now it runs enough current.
B003WAV02M|5.0|I had never heard of this movie. It is really good. Nicholas Cage is excellent as usual and it is based on true events. Very interesting til the very end. I would even watch it again.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|This low-key sleeper is a way worth the time and effort. Go see Mr. McConaughey at his best. Who knew that little dude could act? Wow.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I gave it a 4out of 5. It was an original story told in a very original way. I hope the movie does half as well.
1476735115|5.0|The concept for this book was unique, at least in my experience.  Always thinking ahead what you think will happen, well , think again!  Justin Cronin recommend this book and that was the only reason I purchased it.  Did not disappoint.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My Horse is a very realistic horse sim! The graphics are wonderful! If you love horses as much as I do, then you'll be addicted to this as much as I am!
B00CATSONE|5.0|Nikola Tesla: Imagination and the Man That Invented the 20th Century is an easy to read and compelling account of legendary major career accomplishments as well as the failures of one of my heroes. Although not specifically mentioned in this kindle the concept of \\"Imagineering\\" has also been used to describe the process of realization of creative spirits. This book presents several good examples and also does a very good job of outlining the major aspects pertinent to this process.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|wish u could get different things and build coins faster and I wish everything would use coins not stars that would be a lot better
B000002KB8|3.0|It's pointless to say anything else about Black Sabbath, a milestone in Rock History. My frustration comes from the cd itself. Only two sheets of paper in a lame package, doesn't help to the case of a format of distribution for music, which claims to be dying because of the Internet and the East Europe cyber-pirates....
B000JMKRKC|5.0|I've never read anything quite like this.  It is a story within a story within a story.  A good Gothic tale. Loved it
0374214913|4.0|The writer creates fabulous descriptive prose.  I would recommend this book to young and old alike. Would not make a movie however...no overt sex,  explosions, gun battles, meth houses, car chases or James Bond stunts.  Maybe the characters will reunite in another book
B007REV4YI|5.0|As a big fan of James Bond saga I am glad to see another great movie showing a real man with weakness and past. Also I am glad to see the story got back the way it was with Sean Connery. Much better than Quantum of Solace fiasco but my favorite one still Casino Royale. In Addition I am glad the Digital Copy can be downloaded from iTunes. I hate those UltraViolet which do not allow iTunes. Worth to buy if you a fan of Bond, James Bond
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this game! It works real well too......very addicting! I am so glad I have it on my tablet. I can play it anywhere!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|First game I've really enjoyed on the kindle!  Can't wait for the next one! I hope they have the next one coming out soon!
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|too old to be hooked on this game. i try to ignore it, but something keeps nagging and nagging to play it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I have recently become a fan of this show. Season 3 is the best season of the Walking Dead so far! I cannot wait to see season 4.
B004R0W8E0|4.0|The stories are really touching and they stay with you for a long time. I found it in my local library and then bought it on amazon for my ma-in-law and she loved it too.Jhumpa Lahiri excels in human relationships and all the complexities that come with it. Lovely read.
B00BF123WG|3.0|It was just ok for me. I liked Seal Team Six much better. I am glad I watched it, but mad I paid to do so. 😣
B0072OFM28|5.0|It was the best series. I was so sad to for it to end....Am going to watch the reruns....and over and over.<br />It will be wonderful, thank you for having it available.
0061733199|4.0|...beware historical information and references. I discovered errors, which kind of takes away from the dependability and credibility of some of the &#34;facts&#34; now, IMHO. I hope the information is more reliable than the history of events.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Add a bunch of new characters. some of my ideas are army man for tank,add a tractorand farmer,mother cross driver for motocross bike
B0094M2S5A|4.0|It was good again.  Definitely an adult movie, some of it was a bit much.  I enjoyed the music a lot.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Good game, just as good as the android/Iphone version. Next game they need on Amazon is Into the dead! Overall, awesome game.
B00AWJYJVA|4.0|John Le Carre serves up another smorgasbord of espioncrats, bureaucrats, passionate Englishmen, devious mercenaries, and ill-managed operations.  Cynicism and cover up abound.  Even if his characters' conversational tics annoy, this is an absolutely compelling yarn, very well told, and almost impossible to put down.  Good to see Le Carre back on form.
B005MYEQ4U|4.0|This movie has a light humor, and is quite enjoyable particularly to watch with family. Actors do a great job, and having Paris as background gives it a great boost!<br />The main charactor is a writer, and the plot turns around his difficulties in writting. Being a huge fan of liturature as I am, in particular of Hemingways work, this movie was great and really amusing. I heard however from friends not as well versed with authors from the early 19 hundreds, that they theyfound it ok but not as interesting.
B009CGQ88G|5.0|It doesn't get much better than this!  James Stewart and Grace Kelly give excellent performances!<br /> Alfred Hitchcock keeps you at the edge of your seat!  Bravo!!
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|I was not a big fan of the first reboot of \\"Star Trek.\\" I gave it a pass because it wasn't terrible and I knew it was an origin story. That said, \\"Star Trek: Into Darkness\\" is a great \\"Trek\\" movie. It actually had a brain and a conscious!<br /><br />I'll be pre ordering this one even though I never purchased the first movie.<br /><br />Any true Trek fan will be very satisfied in this one. And all the \\"new\\" people to Trek will begin to understand why Star Trek is held in such high regard.
B00AZMFK3K|1.0|After leaving the IMAX theater yesterday morning, I was angry with this film.  As with the first in the reboot, it had some pretty serious science faux pas for anyone even mildly familiar with physics, astrophysics, stellar cartography, etc.  But, more importantly, this isn't 'Star Trek'.  It shares the name and found some decent actors to fill pre-existing roles, sure... but everything that made the varying series and movies 'trekkie' -- the undertones of hopefulness, optimistic human aspiration in the face of challenges, moral growth, and even exploration of somewhat relevant technological ideas that had already inspired more than one generation to 'boldly go' and invent many of the things they saw in the original and following series -- all sidelined in the name of action, be it social reforms, cell phones, hyposprays, 80% of folk working at NASA during one inquiry in the early 90s, I think, and dozens more things whose innovators point back to the show they watched as a child for having inspired them to do such things.<br /><br />This reboot has lost ~all~ of that, and topped it with a thick and sour sauce of bad science and conceptual black holes that any first year physics student could have helped the director/writers patch up.  Even as far as an action movie goes (presuming you took away the good name and just slapping any old thing on it) it is fairly shallow material.  Nonstop action, explosions, etc.  It's Die Hard in space... except space is terribly represented.<br /><br />I have had opportunity to enjoy other J.J. Abrams works in the past (his 'Super 8', for example, had so much of what Trek used to have and has now been lost)... Still... he is not worthy of Trek and should never have been allowed anywhere near it.  I have great difficulty imagining that Roddenbury would have taken this in stride.  I thought the rewiring of history was a great way to explain a reboot... but... couldn't he have held on to any of the high minded, creative, and optimisticideals that the originals held fast to?<br /><br />Having grown up on this stuff, this may be hitting me harder than it will anyone from the newest generation... but take any thing you hold to high regard and imagine it remade in any way you appreciate the least and you'll have a hint at the given rating.  Stick a spiked mace and rugged shield in the arms of the Statue of Liberty for an equivalent corruption of original intent.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Spectacular photography, a gripping story, and the insights to life in the early 20th century are very pleasing.  Many twists and turns in the plot.  The end of Victorian life in England and how they adapt to the New World are very interesting.  And hilarious barbs and cuts!  A must see.
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|This is a well conceived and executed game The graphics are spot on and the action is fast. The game play is realistic, and most goals are attainable. An excellent shooter.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|It was very interesting and awesome. It had a awesome finish. I couldn't tell what the ending would come to be. P.s that's a good thing
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|Kenny has reinvented himself with two wonderful partners.  The songs are beautiful, the harmonies are amazing.  You can't beat the price.  I wish them the best.  Really talented group!<br />Little Victories is probably my favorite, but there aren't any losers on this album.  Georgia's voice has so much personality and style.  I know I've heard Gary's voice somewhere.  I'll have to google him to see what else he has done besides write.  I found that I was more of a Kenny Loggins - solo fan than I was a fan of his L&M days.  This record reminds me of his solo work.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|An avid fan of Bocelli, and I was not dissappointed in this new release.  It has already become a favorite of mine.  It is sweet and romantic and lovely to listen to.
B004DK5CYM|4.0|This was a gift for my mother and see has watched this over and over again.  What a great movie.
B004W1GCNC|4.0|This shoe is pretty entertaining. It's not as good as Downtown Abbey, but it's good for any Anglophiles like myself.
B00177YA1K|5.0|A good and funny movie, with Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones at their best. Good, clean entertainment, worth watching
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|so glad to finally get this on my kindle fire.  I absolutely love this game. keep sending out the updates new levels and vehicles are awesome.
B0049IHX2C|5.0|Good movie with great entertainment. No profanities and trash talk, can hardly find anything nowadays anymore. Great value for the money
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This book was a complete pleasure to read. I was on deployment  myself as I read about Adam and his Family. It was a true inspiration and has motivated me to change my own mindset about things in my life. Thanks Adam! ...and Thanks to the Brown Family for sharing this amazing story. Hooyah Philippians 4:13!
B00190KZUU|5.0|The screenplay is fantastic and Burton did a great job incorporating his style into it. One of my favorite films.
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|A brilliant comeback album from the lovely and immensely talented Agnetha F&auml;ltskog! Although \\"A\\" only features 10 songs, and has a duration of under 40 minutes, every song is a gem and it is truly a gift to hear Agnetha's heavenly voice bringing these wonderful new tunes to life with such passion and her own brand of magic. A must have!
1610390938|5.0|Poor Economics is a fascinating, well-written book that takes a different perspective on poverty - the one of the millions of people living on less than a dollar a day. This vantage point is not something that is commonly written about, especially in the Western world. The authors do a superb job of explaining their findings from talking with the poor and from the results of the randomized trials. As I was reading, there were times where I was a bit frustrated and thought to myself things like, \\"Why wouldn't you take your kid to get immunized? It's common sense!\\". But that's my perspective from growing up in the developed world. I don't understand the day to day challenges facing the poor and the reasons behind some of their decisions. Poor Economics is a book that gives us a glimpse of that.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|All I can say is that this game really tested you on your perspective of how we think about our reality.
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|If you want to be entertained for 2 hours, and you aren't someone who liked to pick apart movies and play movie critic, this is a good movie. It has a simple plot to follow, good acting, suspense, a lot of action, and that's about it...isn't that enough?
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book explains how to understand your (potential or current) partner so much more than you thought you did!  I really enjoyed the personal story connections to each topic -- they made the explanation even more understandable.
B0067R0APK|5.0|Great buy! Love the detail and precision hourly temps and forecasting. The ability to receive radar reports from more than one location at the same time is fantastic too.
B002MGGM9I|5.0|You can watch this movie over and over and still gain more insight every time.  The beauty is in the intertwining of the character stories along with the psychological dilemma of Donnie.  Incredible storyline and well worth owning.
B009FXIICK|1.0|I don't like this game. it just isn't my type of game. if you like matching animal games, this is your game. I for one, do not recommend this game. if you have ever played bejewled and you like it, this is a five star game for you. if you don't like bejewled, then don't waist your money on this game.
B00005AREQ|5.0|This is up there with any great traditional jazz fusion artist of the mid-70's.  The most impressive thing for me is that Jeff Beck continually reinvents his sound and is expert at so many different styles of music.  This is an essential album for any serious jazz fusion aficionado.
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|this game is great but vinnie told me to invite a friend but I don't know how! disappointed. also, they shouldn't give you impossible tasks that cost real money. I need gems to skip tasks but to get gems I need to pay real money or complete tasks that I can't do!!! love the lps toys but very disappointed in this game. gameloft has some work to do.
B0012GMZDG|4.0|Solid Effort by the Great Jeff Beck.  I'm always fascinated to hear the many styles of music that Jeff Beck plays.  This is Jeff's first real foray into melding rock guitar w/ Electronica-type music.  Check it out.
B00821OX98|4.0|I almost cut Skies loose after the first couple of episodes, but I'm gald I stuck with it to let the plot and characters develop.  It has a Gene Roddenbury feel to it when, even under threat of alien anialation, we struggle with authority, we still fight each other, and males can never keep their feet out of their mouth.  As this small contingent of suvivors and resistance fighters make their way to join up with other rumored survivors, they have one or two fire fights with the aliens along the way.  The aliens, by the way, capture the children, attach a creepy crawly to their spine, and wah-la, cheep labor.  But it also does more.  Tune in and find out.  If your a Star Trek kind of guy, you'll like Falling Skies.
1592407889|5.0|Well written. Not easy to share your life when the outside world thinks you have it made being a child of a celebrity. Honest personal account.
B009NY43NY|1.0|Would it be to wierd to erase this book and replace it with one well written, with not so much inconsistencies between the characters and the story line with the previous 12 books?<br />This book is so disappointing in so many levels that I really can't belive is the end of the series. I was speckting so much  that this lame, sloppy and disrespectful end moves me to voice my discontent with the author's literary choices.<br />I really really can't believe what was done in this book. I trully could had waited one or two more years to have  real ending. But this...
B002SF9YNO|5.0|I cannot tell you how much my husband and I enjoyed this movie. You will not be disappointed. Very well written and given you a taste of the culture and customs. Brilliant! One of my favorites! I was very much surprised and highly suggest that you see it.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|This game is the best. But you get 16 mins of play<br />Time. THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!<br />Id sugjest you play this!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I have been waiting for this app to come out ever since I saw it on my mom's I-pad. I'm so happy they finally put this on the appstore!
B0035OC7OU|5.0|I have decided to read all the Disc World books in order and am so glad I did.  It fills voids I didn't know were there in other books.  This is about one of my favourite characters: Death, who speaks in CAPITAL LETTERS but doesn't shout.  Mort is Death's apprentice, an innocent farm boy given the task of reaping and doesn't do it very well causing issues with the space time continuum.  Do like I did and start at number 1.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Nemo's Reef is a great game and easy enough for even the smaller ones. My daughter enjoyed this game and loved that she could help Nemo build the reef from scratch.
B0086700CM|5.0|a great game to kill time. it was free but I would actually pay for this app.<br />works great with kindle fire
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|it was a very thought provoking story. your heart goes out to all the characters. loved the story and most of all the ending
B006MPKAOI|5.0|I  loved this book, I don't normally read much at the weekends but I could not put it down & read the whole book !!! Excellent.
B00CL68BK2|5.0|Such great, well developed characters that almost anybody can relate to.  I enjoyed it so much I watched it three times within the 48 hr rental period!
B00BD2DRHW|3.0|It's a little to hard to much time spent building the bridge and just when you think you got wrong
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|This is a modern twist on Sherlock, but it is interesting.  The interaction between Holmes and Watson, Lucy Lui, keeps me intrigued.  Lucy Lui is great a always.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|The music sound track CD is wonderful.  Some of the artists are from another era that I had forgotten, but now I can listen over and over again!  Let's go back to Hiwaii on our next vacation!!
B007XAYKX8|5.0|Great Doc for motorcycle fans, new and old.  Too bad this sport doesn't get as much press as NASCAR in the US.  Same drama just more exciting.
B009O2XY12|5.0|It keeps you wanting more because you want to save the babies. I like to figure out how to save them all without buying jewels.
B000FA5TTW|3.0|A very interesting book, yet a little slow. Defiantly worth your time reading, especially if you have seen the movie.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game was so much fun I couldn't put it down!!!!! It was difficult in some spots put still awesome!!!!! I love it and can't wait for the next!!!!
B007FG9LIE|4.0|I couldn't decide whether I wanted to classify this one as horror, mystery/thriller, sci/fi fantasy. Doesn't matter what genre, it's a great book and I'll definitely try more by this author
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Good official game and nice detailed suits. Goal updates give replay value. Would recommend to iron man fans. Pepper is still fine.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Haven't played but a small portion of this game yet, but it plays well. The graphics are excellent, not the cartoony anime usually seen with this type of game.
B00BGIBVRG|2.0|This is a go nowhere, depressing &#34;comedy&#34; that isn't very funny. Wish we had avoided this one, and spent our money on something else.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|They do a fine job of having multiple plots going on at the same time & interweave them together. Well done!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this calculator and use very often. I highly recommend this calculator app, I am giving it five stars!
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Another old horror story. There have been so many stories about this particular demon and probably will be more to come. It is a timeless story and very well put into prose about the vampire who had many names and victims by Bram Stoker. Makes one wonder how they came up with these ideas and had the courage to put them into words in the time they were living in. How many people did they really scare and how many people believed this type of story and changed their lives because of it.....interesting thought.
B00BXKKNFS|2.0|I am a big fan of ABP from my Firefox usage, but on my mobile device it did not block ads during gameplay (WWF and Scramble).  I even uninstalled ABP, but I can't remember why... perhaps resource usage?  Or maybe that was the only way to disable it. I forget.<br /><br />When I got ABP, I was still on Android 2.3 Gingerbread so maybe that was related.  Since then my phone was force updated to ICS 4.0 (which is not making my phone happy at all - very annoying!), so maybe I will give ABP a try again with ICS.  After ICS, several apps had to be updated, but also resources are much tighter so am not sure I want more running in the background
B005CRQ4XI|3.0|I felt as though I took the journey with her. Yet after spending so much time on the trail I felt the end was abrupt.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I loved this series and watchng the characters grow from the start to the end was a great journey, I really loved it!
B005LJETYI|5.0|Really enjoyed this book! And hell, I didn't even realize they were adapting it for a Feature Film until after I finished it! Super fast paced and packed full of action.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I had to watch it a second time the next evening.  A large cast, wondering how much more development of characters will be seen in the next 2 installments of this story.  I enjoyed this very much and then, it ended.<br />Loved the setting, richness of scenes, and the detail to the dwarves costume and make up.  I am looking forward to the second<br />part of the trilogy.  How can you not compare to the Lord of the Rings and two that followed, but they are different stories.
193700788X|4.0|Dead Ever After is the last book of the Sookie Stackhouse series.  The series has had ups and downs, but in the end, I have nothing but love for Charlaine Harris who created a series that hooked me onto paranormal books and inspired me to continue to branch out in my reading adventures.<br /><br />The Sookie Stackhouse series is the very first adult paranormal/vampire series I ever read.  I started reading this series years ago, I have invested a lot of reading time in the Southern vampire and supernatural filled world that Charlaine Harris created.  I've loved Sookie from the start, she is a southern, down-home girl who becomes embroiled in supernatural drama because of her unique \\"extra\\" talents.  Sookie is a telepath, she is unique, she is cute, and fiercely loyal.  Through the series, Sookie made some good decisions, some terrible decisions, and her life took all sorts of turns.  In Dead Ever After, Sookie's story finally comes full circle as Sookie starts making real decisions about her future.<br /><br />At the end of Deadlocked (book 12), it became clear that Sookie was on-the-outs with the vampires, including her vampire boyfriend Eric.  That theme is continued in Dead Ever After.  The vampires play relatively minor roles in this book in comparison to earlier books.  I missed Eric, but his character has changed through the series, and the allure of the vampires dwindled.  Other than Eric and Bill, the vampires are as over Sookie as she is them.<br /><br />There are several dangers to Sookie in this book, she has been framed for the murder of her former best friend, Arlene, and mysterious enemies are out to kill her.  Sookie's friends come to her side to bail her out,  have her back, and help her stay alive.  I loved getting to see so many characters again, from Quinn the weretiger to Bob, the former cat.  There have been so many characters through the previous 12 books who had an impact on Sookie, and Charlaine Harris did a very good job bringing them together for Dead Ever After to help tie the series up.<br /><br />As for the outcome, the finale to the series, it was fairly predictable.  There was no huge surprise for me, no \\"I can't believe Sookie did that,\\" or \\"What the hell?\\"  There were a few head-scratching moments (mostly including Eric and Sam), but, I could see the direction Sookie was heading a few books ago, and I believe that this was the right path for her.<br /><br />The Dead Ever After finale was not epic, it was simply an end.  I am satisfied with this last book though.  I know that there is no way for Charlaine Harris to make every reader happy, but I felt that this last book was fitting to the series.  I think that I will always want more Sookie, but all good things must come to an end at some point.  Sookie Stackhouse will always be a favorite character of mine and I will always be grateful to Charlaine Harris for introducing me to the spectacular world of paranormal romance and urban fantasy.<br /><br />*I received this book in exchange for an honest review*er for Dead Ever After to help tie the series up.<br /><br />As for the outcome, the finale to the series, it was fairly predictable.

B002QKZLZ6|5.0|I love my bluetooth and was worried that it would be damaged in my bag.  I was looking for something lightweight, slim, but<br />still protective for my headset.  I tried another item that zipped, was padded, advertised it would fit, but no...  This case fits the headset perfectly. It only comes in black, but works great on all other counts.  I would hate to lose either of these items, but if so,<br />I wouldn't hesitate to buy another to replace the Voyager Pro and this Carrying Case.
B007VUA7VO|3.0|I like that the app let's you know how much time you have to do certain things with your Kindle.  I wish it would do more than just display the battery times.  Like give you ways to extend Battery life.  Overall, it's a decent battery app.
1609611543|5.0|I truly enjoyed reading every page of this scientific treatise on why Americans are so overweight and what they can do to change their situation.  Astonishing to read about the linkages to diabetes, heart disease, schizophrenia, acne and much, much more.  One must be very dedicated to give up all gluten. but certainly cutting back on these foods is doable.<br /><br />Should be mandatory reading for all high school seniors and college freshmen.
B000JMKNJ2|1.0|The author tried to pull a Pulp fiction by jumping through the story timelines left and right. Sadly he failed miserably!<br /><br />Bad read, easily predictable!<br /><br />Save yourself some money and avoid this book!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|This book was so-so compared to John Grisham's other great books.  I bought it without reading any book reviews about the Racketeer.  I bought it because of the other Grisham books I enjoyed very much.  I don't think he worked on this one too much
B00AAQWMB4|5.0|A joy to play on my Nexus 7! On my HTC One, the resolution is even better but sometimes the &#34;flipped&#34; blocks &#34;unflip&#34; before you can play them. The haptic feedback works well to convey a subtle hint. If you like the board game, RUN (don't walk) to get this today.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|ok more to it would bfun it needs better looking look and more to choose from still ok to play I wouldent buy or say pay more than 10&cent;
B004TI1WME|5.0|Does exactly what it says. Very customizable. I like the descriptions for each setting. Its more than ill ever need but looks like it will be handy. D/l as FAOTD but think it is worth purchase price. Very solid app.
B008P1EWIM|1.0|Dont get this app! No radar or nothing no alerts just pretty pictures and stuff i could get for free!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|An amazing depiction of tragedy and the good that can result from it. Colleen Hoover does am amazing job getting readers to feel the emotions of the character Sky.
