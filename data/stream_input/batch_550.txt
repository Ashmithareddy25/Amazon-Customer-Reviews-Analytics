B000929AJQ|4.0|as a long time fan of NIN i consider this to be a step down from previous works but still found it satisfying enough.trent uses techno beats but still seems to make it work.i guess why i give it only **** is because it isn't as memoreable as other albums.the lyrics didn't speak to me as much and eventhough it's almost an hours worth of material it seemed to me to go by too quick.now this isn't neccessarily a bad thing it's just that...maybe it's because to me most of the songs are 'same sounding' and not as easy to be able to tell from apart.i know this sounds like a negative review but i still do like the album.i guess it's just one of those albums that you'd expect more of from trent.i almost want to say that it's more \\"poppy\\" than past material,especially the song,\\"the hand that feeds.\\" all in all it's still a good album.but for those who are expecting another \\"downward spiral\\" forget it.
0743454529|5.0|I had a salesperson come up to me at a bookstore and ask if I needed any assistance.  Well, I didn't, because I was just browsing, and I didn't know what I was looking for anyway.  We chatted for a few minutes about book preferences, and she asked me if I had heard of My Sister's Keeper.  No, I replied.  With a tinkle in her eye (seriously, there was a twinkle!), she recommended this novel by Jodi Picoult.<br /><br />This is a \\"can't put it down,\\" \\"is it real or fiction,\\" and an \\"I've got to get somebody else to read it so that we can discuss it\\" kind of book.  The chapters transition between the different major characters, giving the reader a rich understanding of the complexity of differing viewpoints when it comes to life's challenges.<br /><br />The storyline, in which a daughter engages a lawyer to keep her mother from donating one of her (the daughter's) kidneys to her critically ill sister, is part soap opera, part tragedy, and part legal/medical thriller.  Not wanting to donate a kidney to a dying sister might sound selfish, but Picoult masterfully weaves the concerns and lives of all the characters together into a beautiful, yet tragic, tapestry.<br /><br />The novel will haunt you for days after you finish it.  And isn't that the best kind of book?<br /><br />Share with a good friend...
B00005OWIU|5.0|FIve Words: JOHN WILLIAMS IS A GENIOUS!!!!!!    I have never read the book nor seen the movie, however, there is no doubting the shear beauty of William's score.     Here's a basic play-by-play:    1. Prologue: This is what makes the magic real; seriously this tune should be sacred or something. There is just no comparison or words to describe it.    2. Harry's Wonderous World: Though I know all but nothing about this story, you can tell Harry is a good character (or at least tries to do good). This theme is righteous and innocent; perfect for the hero.    3. The arrival of Baby Harry: Here we reprise the celesta solo from the prologue and add some breathtaking vocals that sweep this piece away masterfully.    4. Visit to the Zoo/Letter from Hogwarts: The beginning is very fun and light, but about half way through we hear the basic theme build and I can just guess that Harry has just read his letter.    5. Diagon Alley/The Gringots: A month ago I was given the shear pleasure to be able to play a suite from this movie with our local orchestra, this piece was included and believe me, you think you know everything about this music until you play it. It's just incredible, the Diagon Alley theme was delightful, but during the Gringots sequence(?) we get to hear the darker theme of Voldemort, the villain make an appearence.    6. Platform Nine and Three-Quarters/The Journey to Hogwarts: Lots of fun Pitzing here with some great woodwinds and triangle. The beginning of this song is so fun, I love it! However, the journey to Hogwarts capture the whole mystical feel in epic scope.    7. Entry into the Great Hall/THe Banquet: Very cheery and nice. Very pretty themes captures the mood wonderfully.    8. Mr. Longbottom Flies!: I do know that this is the flying lesson sequence. PErfecetly captured with that excellent theme we get to here in the beginning few songs, definitely a favorite!    9. Hogwarts Forever!/ THe Moving Staircase: Just so you know, the choral or \\"HOgwarts Forever!\\" is for four french horns and is incredibly difficult, yet still beautiful. You can absolutely tell this is an old school and the choral has a beautiful, reminicent feel to it. But I don't know if I much like the idea of moving staircases.    10. THe Norwegian Ridgeback/A Change of Season:  WE get some fun melodies at first, but my favorite part is the last bit with that gorgeous gorgeous melody featured in one of the last songs.    11. The Quidditch Match: WHat can I say more than classic John Willaims Pomp, though believe me, playing it is no simple task! I love the feel of this, very traditional, yet it still feels like a gorgeous day at the games. I love the full orchestra version of  the prologue theme!    12. Harry at Christmas: I think that is the title of this song, I could be wrong. THis piece starts out very light and fun, but then we here something about ringing the hogwarts bell and casting a Christmas spell???? It's just weird, not my favorite.    13. The invisibility cloak/The Library Scene: This definitely has the feel of what the title suggests. Very somber and quiet; you actually feel as though something will jump out at you any second now!    14. Fluffy's Har: FLuffy! My friend, who told me most of what I know about the story, absolutely adors Fluffy and I think this matches perfectly with the character. The combination of Harp and either Bassoon or bass clarinet is ingenious. IN fact, this is one of my favorite pieces.    15. In The Devil's Snare/The Flying Keys: I have to say, I have absolutely no idea what's going on here, though Mr. Williams throws us some great things here!    16.The Chess Game: Maybe its just me, but I think I'm hearing a bit of Star Wars here. Very march like, yet quite appealing.    17. THe Face of Voldemort: Oh, this piece makes me shudder! The villain, no matter what he looks or sounds like must be very evil with this music playing behind him. Chillingly wonderful, Ten Stars.    18. LEaving Hogwarts: I LOOOOOOOVETHIS SONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The melody is heartwrenching and gorgeous all at once, I aways get choked up at the end. THE BEST PIECE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!    19. Hedwig's Theme: SPECTACULAR!!!!!!!! THis piece is shear genious! WE start off with the prologue from the beginning and launch into an amazing mix wonderful themes and music it takes your breath away!     I love John Williams' music and this is most certainly a MUST HAVE for any fan at any level. In fact, I have written a quote:       \\"Man can not live by bread alone, but by the word of GOd and the Music of John WIllaims\\"    There is no questions and no comparisons, get this today!
B000AMJDHY|4.0|Peter Tulumba <br /> <br /> There are many bands busting their humps trying to make it. Trying to get their music heard. Its rare for a band to be signed only months after becoming a band. Panic! At the Discos debut album A Fever You Can't Sweat Out is a growing success throughout the United States and is growing all over the world. Debuting in September of 2005, this no name band became a quick success. There is not one song on the album that wouldn't want to make you get up and dance. <br /> The Electro-Rock/Pop-Rock band out of Las Vegas, Nevada became a success soon after they posted a couple of their songs on [...] All this success, opening for a nationwide tour (Nintendo Fusion Tour), and signing to a major record label, all happened before even playing in front of a live audience. Panic was simply a garage band, just playing for the heck of it. With this automatic success there must be something about them. <br /> Panics sound is very upbeat and happy. The type of songs they play are incredibly catchy. If you had to compare their sound to anyone other band, it would have to be The Faint fused with Fallout Boy. <br /> These songs are very original. Even though some songs somewhat resemble other songs, they still changed it to make it their own. In \\"Theres a Good Reason These Tables are Numbered Honey, You Just Haven't Thought of it Yet\\" the melody somewhat resembles a song from the Disney movie Aladdin. Even though it sounds like something else it is still very original. Some songs focus more on the techno aspect of the music than rock, like \\"Camisado\\" or \\"Time to Dance\\". It sounds like something you would hear more in a dance club than a rock concert. <br /> They also cover many topics with their lyrics. Their lyrics range from talking about sex in \\"Lying Is the Most Fun a Girl Can Have Without Taking Her Clothes Off\\" to telling their fans to make them popular and get their music heard like in \\"London Beckoned Songs About Money Written by Machines\\"(\\"Well we're just a wet dream for the webzines, Make us it, make us hip, make us scene/Or shrug us off your shoulders/Don't approve a single word that we wrote\\"). With every song comes a great set of lyrics and a great beat that nobody could hate. If you don't like guitars or guitar solos, you have synthesizers and beat machines. If you do like guitars, they still have them.  <br /> Even though Panic has many great songs, it seems as though they have a lack of slow melodical tunes. \\"Nails for Breakfast, Tacks for Snacks\\" may be their \\"slow song\\" but it must be the worst song on the album. The acoustic guitar playing is bland and it seems that the techno aspect that they have hit throughout their other songs has disappeared. <br /> Its a nice change to some of the bland Electro-Rock music out there. Panic has everything. Out of 10, I would give this album a 9. Maybe even higher considering it's Panic! At the Disco's first album. After hearing \\"A Fever You Cant Sweat Out\\" the anticipation kills for their second album. <br />
B000088E6D|4.0|Just like the title says (and this is my opinion), some of you need to get over it.  I'm a senior in high school and I appreciate this kind of music.  I also LOVE Frank Sinatra, and he will never replace Bubl in my mind because...well, he's Frank Sinatra and he's legendary.  No, Bubl probably won't become a legend like Sinatra, but who says I can't appreciate what he's doing?  Have you ever thought that maybe people cover other people's songs because they respect that artist and have a passion to sing their songs because they LIKE those songs?  Along with my parents getting upset over different covers, it seems like a lot of people on here are getting upset, too.  I'm not going to yell at some girl who wants to sing \\"Somewhere Over The Rainbow\\" at a community event just because Judy Garland sang it first and her voice sounded too much like Judy's.  Even if it wasn't published.  Doesn't matter to me.  This guy's got a great voice, and the modern sound makes me want to use it.  People like new twists.  If I were to dance to a Frank Sinatra song, people might think it was overdone.  But dance to this guy?  Then it's a new thing, but an old classic. <br /> <br />If you have any appreciation for the classics and don't flip out over covers or a guy trying to sound like Frank Sinatra, get this CD.  You'll enjoy it.  The sound is fresh and modern and I recommend it.  Especially \\"Fever.\\"
B000A7DVR2|5.0|I first rented this movie at a time when I was riding my bicycle to Blockbuster video on the weekends, and now I am 23. Since my teens I've watched this movie over 50 times.  We often do things because we can, but usually not when it comes to movies.  The Big Lebowski came out in the late 90's and was not gawked upon with the robust blandishment of sanctity that it required in order to relegate its status from pop-culture obscurity to cult classic... or as Mortimor Young would say, \\"It was originally produced by obscure Polygram films and slipped beneath the waves critically and commercially on its first release, floated hither and yon in the corporate paroxysms that shook filmdom during the catastrophic period of synergy.\\"<br /><br />The Grand Lebowski can be seen as an ode to slipping between the cracks.  Every character in the film seems to function beneath societies' norm (even the paralytic Lebowski).  This movie, in my opinion, is 80% character.  These brain products of the Coen brothers attract the \\"out there\\" qualities in the people who truly find the Big Lebowski to be among their favorite movies of all time. Don't worry, you're perfectly sane for loving this movie!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|After seeing Serenity, realizing how incredibly fresh and original it was and then buying the season of episodes on which it was based was a good move...no, make that a great one. I never really got into Firefly while it was on TV; I just don't usually watch television due to the mind-numbing stupor today's shows tend to put me in. This blew me away. The series (and movie) is full of unknowns doing a very good job of acting, the script is...again...refreshingly original (both funny and somewhat intelligent...imagine that) and the special effects aren't too shabby...even accurate (e.g., no sound in space)! I highly recommend this product and the movie Serenity to anyone; being a Sci-Fi and/or Western fan need not be a requirement.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|On the surface, this may seem like a simple dance record, laced with chrystal beats and slick production. To the casual listener, this may seem like the case, however, to the loyal Madonna fan, this may just be the most accomplished recording of her career. The album can be best perceived as a sonic journey, which starts of lightly, progressing deeper and deeper as the record plays on. The first half of the album is an infectious assortment of nostalgia-inducing sounds, laced with immaculate production and lyrics which aim to get the body thumping, and the mind swaying. Madonna wants to have fun, and like it or not, the listener is invited into an unconscious state of bliss, propelled by a continuous stream of melodies and hooks which kindly find their place in your mind. 'Sorry' is a disco anthem waiting to burst out, whilst 'I Love New York' is as campy as they come. Lyrically, the first half of the album is more concerned with the moving of the physical body, than the mind.    Once the blood is pumping at full speed, Madonna keeps the party going, but decides to do some self analysis along the way. 'Let It Will Be' starts off the 'confessional'  segment of the album, and in my opinion, it is here that the album takes on another life. No longer just a mindless dance record, madonna looks at the worthiness of the material world, and the darkness of the human spirit. She questions her place in the world, and whether it will matter when she's gone. She travels to another universe during 'Forbidden Love', easily the most haunting and beautiful track on the album, as she yearns for a desire she cannot possess. The journey reaches it's climax on the stunning 'isaac', and it is on this track that madonna comes full circle. She has learned to appreciate what transcends the physical world, and the comforts of the non-material. Her new found contentness is then accentuated by 'push', a love song to her husband, or perhaps her fans.    The closing number on the album, 'Likeit Or Not', winds down the party, and affirms the listener that madonna hasn't lost her prowess when it comes to making a statemnt, and challenging social norms. The backlash against her previous album hasn't dented the desire to express herself.    On American Life, madonna expressed her desire to come full circle, and with this album, she may have just done that. Sure, at certain points, the beats take over the show, but in the end, Madonna has found the right balance between all elements concerned, and real fans will be saitisfied. This completes the electronica trilogy that began with 2000's 'Music', and one couldn't have hoped for a better closing to an amazing era in Madonna's career.    What comes next is anyone's guess, but with madonna, you know it will be worth the wait.
076790592X|5.0|12/7/2005 <br /> <br /> This book contained many good qualities and a few not so good aspects. The good qualities that I had noticed while reading were the way Mitch Album portrayed Morrie as a guide to life's unsolved sides that had such true emotional feeling while reading on about Morrie's life and death, and how Mitch changed his life according to Morries teachings. The few bad qualities were that the book tends to drag on about Lou Gehrig's disease (ALS) and the fact that the reader does not get to know Charlotte as well as he or she might want to.  <br /> The way that Mitch portrayed Morrie really made me wonder how he felt about writing such a mournful story about such a friend. Books like these catch my emotional side and also make me think about the things that have affected me in my life. I enjoyed getting to know Morrie and Mitch and being able to picture them if I had known them all my life. That is a very important fact while writing a good book, to be able to give life to the characters. <br /> Mitch was very emotional by the end of the book because he was mourning Morrie's death. The emotion was so powerful that even I felt it. The book had such a way of grabbing a reader's heart and showing the meaning of life and death. This book can make a difference if people are willing. A book can not read itself. <br /> One bad quality that I could see as a downer was, droning on and on about Lou Gehrig's disease (ALS). I know that this is a horrible disease that can take years to do its worst but I like to see Morrie dancing and singing about with no worries. The book made it look like people wanted to see Morrie suffer. I know that this is absurd but I did read that Morrie wanted to show the world his high spirits and knowledge about death. I saw that Mitch loved to write and he does a wonderful job doing it. I am not slashing his work. I am showing another opinion on the aspect of other characters. I wanted to know Charlotte better as well as Connie. I really was hoping to know Morrie's brother a little better. All these things I wanted to see more of, but did not. That is the only down side, perhaps a sequel.  <br /> This book contained wonderful stories and smiles that will be read over and over later in time. I saw this book as a true milestone in literature; everyone should own a copy or at least read it once. <br /> <br />
B000005H3Y|5.0|The masterpiece in bebop jazz history which can easily match Sonny Rollin's \\"Saxophone Collossus\\".  Amongst all of Dexter's works this is my personal favourite mainly because there is a distinct feeling of melancholy and a slight detached hint of reverberation heard particularly on the ballads \\"Where Are You?\\" and \\" Guess I'll Hang My Tears Out To Dry\\".   Dexter pours his heart and soul out on these ballads  and weaves a solo so heartwrenching that it's effect is sublime.    I was very fortunate to see Dexter Gordon perform live in London (Ronnie Scotts Club,1977) ..at that time i was young and  didn't really appreciate the magnitude of his BIG sound, style and influence. Very tall, handsome & elegantly debonair to the last note was Dexter. It appeared to me that guys like him would go on forever. He was one of the last of the innovators to survive into the early 1990s.   What an astounding performer! This CD sums his talent up in a nutshell.   Thankfully we still have Sonny Rollins left from that era.
0440238609|1.0|Phillip Pullman has unfortunately expressed a bias against the Christianity of Lewis' Narnia works, believing the Christian message is somehow inferior and bigoted, compared presumably with his works.  Pullman's efforts lack the depth of meaning found within the Narnia works deprived of such resplendent base, leading to unfortunate ramblings without similar quality of meaning.  Less inspired than Narnia, that lack in the Pullman works leaves them unfortunately wanting.

B0006M4SO6|4.0|Pat's and Lyle's latest piece is a Master piece. However you will have to listen to it for 20-30 times \\"to get it right\\". My first thought, when I heard it was \\"Variations\\" by Andrew lloyd Weber - a 17 tunes over the same tema. The Way Up is a bit like that. On the last consert in Montreal (got it on DVD) the number is cooked down to about 30 min. which I think is enough. I know Pat proberply also (after playing it 100 times on tour) wanted to compress it a bit. I think it has a strafe of \\"Imaginary Day\\" over it. Pat and Lyle tries to push there limits of both the band and the technical capabilities. Pat has often spoken about that. Even the music is good it cannot match with \\"Root's of Coincidense\\" or \\"Are You Going With Me\\" or \\"As It Is\\" and so many more of Pat's tunes. It will just as the \\"Question and Answer\\" Trio Album be forgotten after some years. The artistic of it is unquestionable.
B00003CX5P|1.0|\\"Uh-Oh.\\"<br /><br />About 5 minutes into George Lucas's monstrous, reeking, python-thick digital floater \\"The Phantom Menace\\"---which managed to take a merciless dump on about 20 years of fan excitement and goodwill in just the first 20-minutes of running time alone (that's a year of goodwill p*ssed down the toilet a minute, for the mathematically inclined)---5 minutes in, that's what I said to myself.<br /><br />\\"Uh-Oh.\\"<br /><br />Here we have the produce two decades in the making: Jar-Jar, Midchlorians (the Force turns out to be a parasite!---so why doesn't the Empire just innoculate against it?), a cheap-looking digital critter vomited forth every second for the ADD crowd, two-headed sports commentators at a Tatooine NASCAR gig, and best of all, just what I know you came for---a trade war. Yeah.<br /><br />Uh-oh, indeed.<br /><br />So a long, long time ago, in a Galaxy far away, we are told, a young boy, a promising child, steeped in the ways of the Force though ignorant of his destiny, was born to a slave-mother on a backwater desert world.<br /><br />Now: imagine it is 1998. Imagine yourself flush with excitement, coming down off the adrenaline rush of seeing the then merely-remastered (and slightly tinkered-with) original trilogy making a triumphal theatrical run. Imagine the fever-dream of possibilities: the arid, dream-killing landscape of Tatooine, the nascent, frightening power of a small boy, a Power that could still be turned to the Force, should only his Jedi minders find him before the Forces of the Sith did.<br /><br />Imagine the coming of the Darkness; the lengthening of the Shadow. Imagine what \\"The Phantom Menace\\"---promisingly, pulpily titled---could have delivered.<br /><br />Then cry in Despair, O Prince, to see what atrocity shambled forth, weep bitter tears in the bleak, cold, hard face of What Might Have Been, gaze upon what issued forth from Lucas's gaping maw to strut and fret its hour upon the Stage. But mainly to Fret.<br /><br />So take what the fans want: blackhearted, dastardly Sith villains, including the war-faced Darth Maul; epic light saber duels between the frantic Jedi and their Sith adversaries; and hopefully a close-encounter with the brooding child who would grow up to stalk the gantry stations of many a cringing Rebel base as Darth Vader.<br /><br />What did Lucas serve up: he gave Darth Maul perhaps 3 seconds of screen time, flushed him down the cinematic equivalent of a commode (sliced neatly in half, no less, just when the movie had ratcheted up some dramatic tension), and devoted the rest to Jar-Jar Binks, and his entire misbegotten race of pseudo-Rastafarian gob-stopper slinging toads. After Phantom Menace, I gained a newfound appreciation for the Imperial \\"Humans Only\\" rule.<br /><br />Oh, and there's Jake Lloyd as Little Darth. Who amongs us can forget Jake Lloyd?<br /><br />Yes---some would counter, rightly, that Lucas offered us something new in the realm of digital effects. But special effects should *accentuate* the drama, not supplant it.<br /><br />Aside from a nice, dramatic soundtrack (starved by the utter absence of anything approaching dramatic tension or pacing in the film), this is sound and fury, signifying nothing.<br /><br />JSGFret.  <br /> <br />So take what the fans want: blackhearted, dastardly Sith villains, including the war-faced Darth Maul; epic light saber duels between the frantic Jedi and their Sith adversaries; and hopefully a close-encounter with the brooding child who would grow up to stalk the gantry stations of many a cringing Rebel base as Darth Vader.  <br /> <br />What did Lucas serve up: he gave Darth Maul perhaps 3 seconds of screen time, flushed him down the cinematic equivalent of a commode (sliced neatly in half, no less, just when the movie had ratcheted up some dramatic tension), and devoted the rest to Jar-Jar Binks, and his entire misbegotten race of pseudo-Rastafarian gob-stopper slinging toads.

B000BMSTMS|4.0|Korn's seventh studio album, \\"See You on the Other Side\\", is by far their most experimental to date. With the departure of Head, the band was forced to further adapt. The band definitely took this record in a different direction than anything they've ever come out with before, and really, anything I've really ever heard before. The band experiments with a lot of very unique sounds throughout the cd, some of the time seeming a bit forced, but a nice majority of the time meshing very nicely with Jon's vocals.  <br /> <br />At first listen, I wasn't very impressed with the cd. It takes time to get used to a new sound, and sure enough, as I played the record a second, third, and fourth time, I slowly caught myself humming along and getting into the music. The first single off the cd, \\"Twisted Transistor\\", is a catchy, almost pop sounding song. It's an upbeat song with Jon showcasing his unique vocals in full fashion. The first song that really jumps out at me is number 8, \\"Open Up\\". To me this song really demonstrated that Korn is still Korn, despite a more experimental sound, despite heading in a different direction, they still can carry a similar sound. It's followed by what I've come to the conclusion is my favorite song on the cd, \\"Coming Undone\\". Munky's guitar work here is just phenomenal, I love it. My choice songs: Twisted Transistor, Souvenir, Open Up, Coming Undone, and Liar.  <br /> <br />All in all, I enjoy the album, and I'm pleased with it. It becomes addicting. Once again, it's an experimental sound for Korn, but it's a well done experiment. If you have any interest in Korn, I'd recommend picking up this album. Some korn fans that are still living in the 1994 days won't be pleased, but it's and above average album from an amazing band, so it's worth your 12 or 13 bucks. Overall, I rated it a 4 out of 5 stars. There aren't any songs on here to skip over, but at the same time, there aren't that are going to cause a musical revolution, so I give the album 4.Go out, satisfy your curiosity and pick this up!
B000000YBQ|5.0|I was over my best friend house on Thanksgiving day this year and he was playing this beautiful music on his system I,ask him who was that and he replied,\\"Bill Evans\\".The name of the cd is Waltz for Debby.I'said to him this is amazing.Now being Cuban I'am a big fan of lATIN JAZZ BUT Evans music did something to me that day.It took me to a place I have not been in a long time.Now he also told me I owned a cd he was involed in I replied which one he ansewed,\\"Kind Of Blue with Miles\\".I'd was amazed.To those fan that like me heard Evans work for the first time I truly recommend this cd and Sunday at the Vilage Vanguard and all his early work to realy understand this wonderful man.After starting a libary of his cds I see the influence he has had on the likes of Michel Camilo,Bebo Valdes etc..Believe amazon buyers your Sunday morning will not be the same.My wife dose not tell me to lower the radio but to play that vanguard cd.Mucho ache Bill Evans Thank you.
0812550757|2.0|I have read science fiction and fantasy for years, beginning with Piers Anthony.  When you begin with Piers Anthony you expect a lot from an author.  Even his author's notes are so histerically entertaining laughter is unstoppable.  The first time I picked up a book by Orson Scott Card (Seventh Son) I began from the beginning, in this case the author's note.  Honestly it was so dry I had to put the book down in disgust. <br /> <br />Eventually I got over my initial dislike of Card and decided to try again, this time I read Ender's Game and skipped the author's note at the beginning.  When I read Ender's Game, I cried.  It was a beautiful gripping book that could not be touched by another novel.   <br /> <br />Of course when I saw the sequel I just had to read it.  Now I'm not saying that Speaker for the Dead is necessarily bad, but it is not a sequel to Ender's Game.  It's not in the same theme at all, and the characters are not nearly as likable.  Ender was already firmly established in the first book of the series and this book only serves to dampen his character if anything.  Every other character in the book I found to be less than stimulating.  Where I read Ender's Game in one night, Speaker for the Dead took me a good week. <br /> <br />Oddly enough, when I read The Memory of Earth a few years later I loved it.  And it's sequel, The Call of Earth only served to disappoint.  Perhaps Card is not as good at writing sequels, or perhaps I just expect too much. <br /> <br />p.s.  If you liked Ender's Game you'd probably like the Forever Hero series by L. E. Modesitt, Jr.

B0009K7QZ8|5.0|Season 2 is definately better. Of course the first season was still very good, this one has been the best yet.(Last season there was too much sex) There is a really good story line, especially near the end of the season with Trey. In my opinion, the best episode is \\"The Dearly Beloved\\". It was so sad, but really dramatic and very good. Another reason to purchase it is for the great music on every episode. Overall an awesome season and totally worth buying.

B00004Y6NP|1.0|This is just as bad as Communique. 5 of the songs on this are <br />really lame & weak. Why is this considered classic? Another overplayed album is Making Movies and I love that one, it has <br />some really nice tunes. If this is overplayed, I never see Money <br />for Nothing. All I see is So Far Away. And all I hear on the radio is either Sultans of Swing or Money for Nothing. If I'm <br />gonna listen to this overplayed and overrated album, I will just <br />listen to the good songs. Plus this is also all I see in stores. <br />Why is this also so popular, I mean why does everyone like this <br />so much? Especially radios need to stop playing just this and <br />Communique, and go with Love Over Gold, or On Every Street. <br />See Ya Later.
B000BC8TBE|1.0|Mimi seems to love nothing more than raping her fans of their hard earned cash, As she seems adament in re-hashing any stale recording she has made. <br /> <br />The truth is, when it comes to making a christmas album, mariah doesn't have the spirit or warmth to pull off any sense of spirit or joy it takes to produce a worthy christmas album.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Madonna definitely brought Disco back with this one! I'm glad she mostly put her views on life, politics and death on hold while making this album because if she didn't, it would be in ruins. The songs on this album have very easy meanings or no meaning at all, but like she said, who wants to interpret a song while they're dancing? This is a great Cd all the way through and I can't take it out of my player because once you hear the first song you want to hear the next and the next and the next... Honestly, I don't even know why some critics bother reviewing or talking down her albums. She always gets the last laugh because she's always a step ahead of everyone. If you like to dance, buy this album. There's something on here for everyone.
0307276902|2.0|Just as Frey intended, I found myself addicted to this book. I kept telling myself I'd stop at the end of the next chapter, but I couldn't stop myself from reading the next, and the next, until I was finished. When done, I kept picking it up and trying to re-read different sections.    The key word, though, is \\"trying.\\" After I was through, I felt strangely stuffed, yet unsatisfied, like I'd eaten an entire box of doughnuts by myself. As I thought about the book more, I realized bit by bit how incredibly farfetched it was. I was put off by the author's cocky attitude while I was reading, but it wasn't until I put it down that I began to think of it as a weird, unusually gritty fairytale. Another reviewer called the book a \\"male fantasy\\" and I'm inclined to agree.    That deeply disappoints me, because the entire appeal of the book rests on the assumption that it's true. I read memoirs because I want to hear about **real life**, with all its messiness, loose ends, and unresolved conflict. Now I realize that I learned nothing about what the life of a drug addict is like, or rehab, or recovery. Why did I bother to read it? I could have gotten largely the same story - one dimensional characters, villains, dragons to slay, and of course, a lovely damsel in distress - from any Sword `n Sorcery novel sold in the grocery store.    Other people have detailed the many, many suspect parts of this book. I personally find it incredible that a 5'8 man who can barely walk upon entering rehab still manages to intimidate the most hardened, street-wise guys around. It's also odd that almost anyone who could verify his story is either dead or missing. Are the Hazeldon counselors available? They seem like the only people who could back up Frey's assertions.    I also feel that given Frey's controversial subject matter, particularly with regard to his feelings about AA, he had a responsibility to portray his experiences more realistically.    In short: compelling at first, but a huge letdown overall.  __________    Edited because I just saw a picture of James Frey in Oprah magazine, and his eyes are not Pale Green. In fact, they're not green. They are not even hazel. They are a dark, rich, coffee-bean brown. If Mr. Frey can't even be bothered to describe his eye color accurately, I just don't know what to say. Oh well, I guess it will make a better screenplay that way.
B00004X01U|4.0|The only reason why I gave this Cd 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the track \\"Nobody's Perfect\\", it seems like it's missing something. Other than that, I love the whole mood of the album. Some of the key tracks are \\"Music\\", \\"Don't Tell Me\\", \\"I Deserve It\\", \\"Paradise\\" and I love the quirky, highschool-ish sound of \\"Amazing\\". This was Madonna's new millennium Cd.
B000A0GP4K|4.0|\\"No Direction Home,\\" may be the best biography, in any medium, of Dylan out there, except for his own autobiography, \\"Chronicles,\\" and the works seemed to have happened simultaneously.  It's the artist as a young man, from baby-fat folkie to cadaver like rocker, burning his candle at both ends; and it's the times Dylan helped change - whether he likes to admit it or not.  The press conference clips show Dylan as both a captured and captivating participant - at turns volatile, and humble.  It's also a nice look at his peers and mentors, some self-serving, others, like Ginsberg, deeply touching.  The full-length versions of the songs with Dylan captured in concert, and the other interviewees in relaxed settings are all marvelous.  But its Dylan's rendition of \\"Like a Rolling Stone,\\" that blows the lid off - the eye-rolling Dylan is inspired, impassioned, and near crazed.  Anyone performing with that much energy could only crash and burn. <br /> <br />But that's it.  Five years in a career of 40.  It's a good stopping point in terms of dramatic arc, but only the beginning of the story, and certainly left me wanting more.  It's going to be interesting to see what comes next, and maybe \\"Chronicles, Vol. II\\" will be the impetus or co-creative force behind a \\"No Direction Home, Vol. II.\\"   <br /> <br />One can only hope. <br /> <br />

B00006JJ1O|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums, and until today, I had no idea that Tatu had another one. i seriously thought they were popular in Russia, but one hit wonders here in the U.S. Well I was wrong. These girls have sad, raw, warm, and heartfelt lyrics that everyone can relate to. They are lesbians, yes, but I'm striaght and can relate to every song. One of my favorite tracks is probably Clowns. I can relate to it so much. Its a song about love that people don't accept, and weather your homosexual or not, everyone can relate to it. There first single, \\"All the things she said\\" is another excellent song. Like most of the tracks, it is also about unaccepted affection. My favorite lines are \\"Mother looking at me, will I ever be free, have I lost my mind... Daddy looking at me, tell me what do you see, have I crossed the line?\\" and then it goes off into the chorus. This album is one that, besides the wonderful lyrics is very fun. Its got amazing techno beats, and even my dad, who unlike me listens to more rap, r&b, classical, and reggae, really loves it!

B00005JNQS|5.0|I like to hear these adult ideas on what makes a good kid movie.  The best critic on what makes a good kid movie are - kids.  My son and his friends have watched this movie I don't know how many times, and they laugh and enjoy it every time.  This is a great under rated kids movie.  Don't listen to the critics, listen to your kids.  The company that made this movie and Ice Age are nothing short of Great!!
B0000683DH|5.0|Make no mistake trekers and non trekers. Star Trek II is THE BEST STAR TREK MOVIE. The combination and intensity of space adventure, action and emotional impact is nowhere to be seen on the other ST films. The musical score composed by James Horner is a masterpiece and director N. Meyer reaches masterful heights in some scenes such as the first combat between Enterprise and Reliant, Spock's death and the epilogue of the movie. There are other popular ST movies like III,IV,VI and First Contact, but the Wrath of Khan beats them all as a cinematic piece and while it's not absolutely perfect (no ST film is) it is the only Trek film that makes it to the realm of classic movies.
B000BMSTMS|5.0|To give this album anything less than 4 stars is a disgrace. What are these other reviewers listening too,(did you buy disturbs new cd by mistake maybe?) This isnt the same (untalented) riff played over and over again. Korn has shown that they have \\"grown\\" out of sounding like every other band out there (that ripped off their sound). Yeah maybe this cd reaches out on a limb a bit, but you have to now days with so much cookie cutter garbage out there. Jon has shown that he can actually sing and that he still can write some really good SH*T! The music has a lil' bit of a NIN sound to it in some songs, which adds more depth and character to their new sound. On the song \\"Liar\\" he shows he can still do the \\"twist\\" style lyrics, very good move. Overall this is one of Korns better album, just behind the self titled and Life is Peachy. (lightyears ahead of Issues and Untouchables) GOOD JOB KORN!
B000AA4M9U|3.0|Granted BB King is 80, he continues to play the blues like no other. This album though, I think, does not show that whatsoever. If you're a 30-40 something house wife who digs the \\"blues\\" this is for you. But if you are a blues purist, this album lacks detail and motion. Celebrity guests doesn't sell this album to me at all. They should have done this live to really get an effect. I saw BB King in January of 05, and he was amazing. See him live, get Live at the Regal, then you'll know the real King.
B000001IQH|2.0|I am more than dissapointed that Matt and Tim went on to make this band after Operation Ivy, where Op Ivy had a unique original sound, this sounds just like every other mediorcre 90's punk band, especially when they don;t blend music genres and just try to play straight out punk.<br /><br />The fact that this band is slow, (in most songs), instrumentally weak, and vocally annd lyrically, EXTREMELY WEAK, needless to say, this creates a boring album of music that we have heard before, but played by a more talented band.<br /><br />Whereas The Clash, or Operation Ivy, blended music genres to create a unique sound and were not over merchandised or ovverated, this band blends punk with crappy punk, so, err, right.<br /><br />I am thuroughly confused with Tim Armstrong, he used to be a good singer, (His lyrics and vocals in op ivy's song, \\"Bad Town\\" were more than just good, they were awesome!) but what the hell is this stuff? his vocal quality has gone down 4 stars in my opinion, his guitar playing has lost it's flare, I mean really, can't he keep on rocking like old times with a new band? not neseccarily play the same stuff, but atleast keep the talent level the same?<br /><br />I mean look at this Lars guy that Matt and Tim found on the street, why is he in the band? he sucks! there was no need to bring him into this. The drummer is OK but all in all his riffs are boring, I'm hearing the same beat over and over.<br /><br />All in all, this band was doomed from the start, because let's face it, punk is dead and cold, it just aint the same any more, and we are just going to have to appreciate the bands of the 80's and such and worship what punk once was, ignore the modern garbage, (especially those hideous, sickening revolting, discraceful, emo bands, and pop-punk crap!) yes, this does include all of those pitiful little bands that you see on TV, aka, Green Day, Good Charolotte, Linking Park, all that lame wanna-be punk crap. (Green Day isn;t punk anyway, it's alternative rock! WTF!?).<br /><br />stick with the classics people, this new punk will bring you naught but grief and shame.<br /><br />-PEACEtive rock! WTF!?). <br /> <br />stick with the classics people, this new punk will bring you naught but grief and shame. <br /> <br />-PEACE

B000BVEKO0|5.0|Wow. KoRn came back after a couple of average albums with a MINDBLOWER. Yes, people, See You On The Other Side is one hell of a great album. Truly a rebirth of KoRn without losing their signature \\"sound\\". The experimentation works amazingly and the album definately has a complete feel, as opposed to some albums that just feel like a collection of tracks put together. My stand out tracks: <br /> <br />Twisted Transistor <br />Hypocrites <br />Throw Me Away <br />Love Song <br />Open Up <br />Getting Off <br />Seen It All <br />Tearjerker <br />Eaten Up Inside <br /> <br />I think the departure of Head and the band's new deal have paid off. <br /> <br />Also, what a great deal! Bonus CD with extra tracks and cool pop-up artwork, 2 live video clips, and a year's membership to the fan club (mine doesn't seem to work, but oh well) This makes it definately worth buying as opposed to downloading it. <br /> <br />KoRn ROCK!!!!!!!
B000000WGL|5.0|Listen carefully.  This is the guy who wrote all of the Rolling Stones' songs and then let the other guy have some credit, the other guy being the greatest vocalist in the history of recorded music.  Forget about all that drug and alcohol talk.  Listen to him, revere him, respect him.<br /><br />There is far more here than meets the eye.
B00007FOMP|5.0|The best way that that I can describe this album in a nutshell is basically as, an airy journey through the heart and mind of an observant soul searcher as he responds to his social surroundings... for the most part anyway :-).  This album is unbelievably coherent both sonically and thematically, and just incredibly even in tone all throughout.  \\"What's Going On\\" is a true concept album in every sense and is the first great one that Motown produced. It is probably the first great one in all of soul music.  This particular piece of work is special even when compared to most concept albums because while most great concept albums present a strong, unified statement or vision, few embody such a grand idealism.  Gaye is the ultimate idealist all throughout, which is really what defines this album, and why it still resonates so well today.  It is almost unbelievable that Barry Gordy did not want to release it.  I guess that Gordy didn't think that this album was kitschy enough for the public; \\"oh no, oh no, all of these unfamiliar words and grand ideas, not on my label!\\" (Note: this is not an actual quote from Gordy, just my own feeble and unapologetically sarcastic attempt at regressive mind reading).  I've read that Mr. Gordy asked Marvin Gaye, \\"what in the world is Ecology\\"? (Now that really is close to an actual quote).  Well Mr. Gordy, Ecology is basically the study of how organisms interact and interrelate with their environment, and it was brilliant of Gaye to use that as the core idea for a song here because the idea fits into the album's concept perfectly.  The lyrics of \\"Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)\\", all of the lyrics on this album in fact, are so incredibly effective because they are so convincingly heartfelt.  It is a blessing to all of us that Gaye finally got this album released.  Story has it that Marvin Gaye had recorded the first version of this album, but decided to change it because he was unsatisfied with the final results.  There was just something missing.  That  \\"something\\" was bass virtuoso James Jamerson.  James Jamerson was simply B-R-I-L-L-I-A-N-T, and he could embellish within a set song structure magnificently enhancing the melody, all while being absolutely impeccable rythmically.  Story has it that Gaye went out looking for Jamerson, and found him playing in a local club in Detroit.  He convinced Jamerson to come back and play on the album, and he ended up giving some of the best performances of his career.  Legend has it that on the title track, Jamerson plays bass on the whole song while lying on his back on the floor in the studio because he was simply more comfortable there !!!!!(Listen to the title track picturing that, focus on the bass, and simply sit back and marvel at Jamerson's genius).  It should also be noted, and this is something that I rarely hear mentioned, that this album is probably the greatest example of the influence that the influx of jazz musicians crossing over to the soul and R&B scenes had on the increase in the level of sophistication of the musicianship, and the overall spike in the quality of the material coming out of these scenes in the 60's, with their influence remaining strong throughout the 70's. The Funk Brothers (the in house musicians for Motown), we're all local jazz musicians who used the skill and savvy that they had acquired in that arena, to become an almost immeasurable influence on popular music in general; from R& B to Soul, and from Funk to Rock & Roll (a certain well-known British invasion group spent a large portion of the early part of their career trying to imitate these guys).  This album is their greatest single work.  And last but certainly not least, Marvin Gaye is one of the greatest pure vocalist ever.  His extra smooth tenor is one of the most distinct voices that I have ever heard, and it adds immensely to the effectiveness of his interpretations of the material here.  This album works brilliantly as a cohesive whole, and the sum total is about the most genuinely transcendent album that I've ever heard.  This is one legendary album that truly does live up to all the hype, and it should be a part of every music lover's collection!

B000BMSTMS|3.0|Let's be honest...Korn hasn't been Korn since before they lost Head.  They ceased soul and emotion since they lost Ross Robinson (original producer).  Nothing they have put out since then has even been close to the raw emotion in Jon's voice on the first three albums.  Now they have such an overproduced sound that they sound like everyone else.  It's not bad cd, but it's not Korn.  There are some good riffs and it's better than I expected without Head being there, but again they have failed to make a timeless classic like their first three cd's.
0060516402|4.0|This is an inspiring book, and informative. It answers the \\"what\\" question convincingly. I missed answers to the \\"why\\" questions. Why, for example, are successful visionary companies characterized by their emphasis on ethical standards? There are many possible explanations: the staff of the company are inspired by the ideals and give more to their employer; the companies reap payoffs in the long term from grateful recipients of their honorable deeds; the companies acquire a good reputation which increases sales and hence profits. More interesting, is the question of the logic of ethics in the business game - not even touched by these authors.<br /><br />According to Jim Collins and Jerry Porras, it does not matter what the company ideology is, as long as it is passionately believed by the management and employees. I find this a dubious claim, and not supported by the data. The ideological frameworks of the companies that were studied are not interchangeable, not for the trivial reason that the ideology of another company happens not to be the one believed by each of them. Boeing is unlikely to spend money on a program to cure river blindness in Africa. Why does Merck do this? Clearly, a pharmaceutical firm does well to invest in a reputation for medical generosity that flows from a passion for making people well? Merck is purchasing precisely the trust that pays-off in the medical market place. Trust reduces transaction costs, and in some cases is almost as good as a monopoly. Boeing, on the other hand, must buy a brand name attached to their dedication to engineering excellence. It does matter what companies are passionate about.<br /><br />My company operates on the Internet. Our pledge includes the words: \\"The tragedy of the commons is the propensity of users to take more from the commons than they give. We undertake to contribute more to the commons than we take. Our presence shall make the Internet safer, more useful and greater fun.\\" Why is this a suitable ideology for our company? The answer is not that this is one we happen to believe in, and feel passionate about - although we do. Rather, this ideology is strategically fitting. We enhance to our brand name, and therefore the value of our software, by adding our reputation to the web applications we write.<br /><br />In one of our daughter businesses we are a broker of information from merchants to consumer (information about products that are available) and from consumer to merchant (we generate real time demand curves for a large range of commodities). We have pledged not to become a trader. Why? In ethical terms, we should not be a trader because our insider information would give rise to conflict of interest. The trust that we gain by not being a trader, and hence remaining a disinterested supplier of market information, enables us to broker Coasian agreements with reduced transaction costs between the parties on the Internet. The advantage is large. It is on the Internet commons that trust is scarce. We are able to purchase this by foregoing some potentially profitable trades, and that pays us more in the long term in our role as an information service provider.<br /><br />Our ideology was designed to give us the greatest possible strategic advantage in our markets. That is not to say we do not believe in our ideals, but that the nature of our ideology is important. It does matter what we believe. It matters what you believe, and it matters that you understand that it matters.<br /><br />I strongly recommend \\"The Modern Firm\\" by Roberts. Read this alongside \\"Built to Last\\". Roberts is a harder read, but he gets under the logic of corporate dynamics better than Collins and Porras. Because \\"Built to Last\\" is characterized by an ubiquitous analytical paucity, Jim Collins and Jerry Porras' interpretations of their data are not always correct. That is a pity. Their findings are exciting, inspiring even, and the book despite its limitations is a good read.ology for our company?

B000BBOUU4|3.0|I hated the org. movie, and still not wild about the plot.  But I am a big Depp and Tim Burtan fan, so that made it good for me. I was bored a bit with both of them tho I fear. <br />I saw this one at the movies and 3 days later went with my 24 yr old daughter to see it again, as she was home for a vist and does not get much of a chance to see movies. <br />We both enjoyed it.  It is with no doubt a Burtan movie, so if you are not into him, you will not be into this one.  It may not be as good as some of his others, but still has his 'stamp' on it. But then I love  Edward Scissorhands, Nightmare Before Christmas,  Corpse Bride, and  Beetlejuice. However I did like it well enough to buy it for my collection. (mostly my Depp collection but I tend to like the movies of Tim Burton's that Depp is in..like the two of them as a team.)
B000067FP7|5.0|This is an awesome movie.  However, I would just like to share that I was about 5 years old when my parents took me to see this in the theater.  I believe this was before the pg-13 rating came into affect.  Needless to say, it scared the beejesus out of me, and to this day, the very thought of the movie makes me shudder just a little.  I still like to watch it......and it still creeps me out.  good flick!  (just don't show it to your 5 year old daughter)
B00003CXAW|3.0|As a child I used to look forward to WOR's King Kong/Son of Kong/Mighty Joe Young marathon every Thanksgiving Day (although admittedly I think Joe was my favorite even back then). I LOVE stop-motion photography, and doing it professionally was one of my earliest career goals that I was never able to pursue. So when this year these 3 films came out in time for Turkey Day, I was really looking forward to it. After watching the original Kong, though, I felt very disappointed. I know there will be purists out there who will refuse to consider the points I am about to bring up, but I implore you to watch this film again with a fresh eye, putting aside all your wonderful feelings of nostalgia, which is what I think is responsible for people having such warm and fuzzy memories when talking about this classic film. (And I'm sure I am just as guilty of having these nostalgic feelings for the seventies' version, which I grew up with, and which does NOT deserve the critical mistreatment it gets just for daring to remake a classic; and I will probably be just as unwilling to accept Peter Jackson's CGI Kong, just as my former generations couldn't accept Rick Baker in a gorilla suit.) While watching the original again after many years, this is what I noticed: The first 40 minutes are chock full of stock characters, corny dialogue, and questionable acting abilities, and no Kong yet. The next 30 have Kong and a bunch of dinosaurs fighting and giving the humans a run for their money, and the final 30 contains the best moments in my new opinion of the film: Kong in New York. As a child I loved seeing the dinosaurs and missed them in the remake; now that I'm older I am grateful that they left them out and am disappointed that Jackson is putting them in his. Kong is a mammal; he has no business hanging out on an island with dinosaurs, an animal separated by 65 million years of evolution. Either make Kong a dinosaur too, or stick to having only giant animals of today, like the giant snake Kong fought in the seventies' one. (Of course, now having seen the documentary extras, I can see how the two ideas originally came from different film projects and weren't merged until O'Brien's Creation film was scrapped and Cooper's The Beast adopted Creation's sets and creatures to utilize ready-made models and props, and to add more to his bare-bones concept.) To be honest, I wasn't that excited by the fight scenes anymore, and felt like there was something missing, and then I realized what it was; all the things I fondly remember from the story came from the remake and weren't even a part of the original: the relationship between Kong and the girl. I feel nothing for the ape when he falls from the Empire State Building in the original climax because I wasn't MADE to feel anything for him. There is no bonding between Fay Wray and Kong, just her screaming her head off in terror and trying to run away from him all the time. But in the remake Jessica Lange has scenes with Kong that are heartfelt, and in the end when she pleads with him not to put her down because she knows that he will be gunned down once he does, it is all-the-more tragic and emotional. Admittedly, this emotional acting wouldn't be as easy to pull off with a stop-motion figure, but that was why the \\"man in a gorilla suit\\" (so often knocked by critics) worked so well in the seventies, especially by someone who started his career bringing apes to life onscreen convincingly in such films as Schlock and The Thing with Two Heads, and who later took it even further in the Planet of the Apes remake and other non-fiction projects. There is one final note about the original that I'd like you to think about before you defend it and attack me so commitedly, and it's a point I'm surprised I hadn't thought about before, one which I've mentioned to others who are devoted to the original and who themselves remarked \\"I hadn't thought of that!\\" This film crew goes to an island to film this remarkable, mysterious \\"eighth wonder of the world\\" that they had heard legends about, but when they arrive on Skull Island and find that it is populated by creatures supposedly extinct for millions of years, they couldn't care less; all they want is to film the big gorilla. They're not at all impressed that they discovered living, breathing dinosaurs, and could get a Nobel Prize for their discovery. Nope, they just fire at them and run away, and then \\"ooh\\" and \\"ahh\\" over the oversized ape. The Beast and Creation should have remained separate projects. It took three writers, each doing a draft, to try to merge the two elements into a plot that worked. They should have went for four!
B000B8QEZG|2.0|Hung Up was a darn good song and mostly because of the ABBA sound. It is strange that a CD that started so well ended up so badly. I listened to the entire thing and had to hit the forward button because there was no way to make it through song #4 it was so awful. The song Push was about as pleasant as a police siren. I Love New York was just mostly her hollaring \\"get off my street\\" about a hundred times. Issac sounded like classical music speeded up with an Arab guy singing in the background and ends with him uttering something that didn't make sense about the gates of heaven and \\"that's what it's about\\" It is a weird CD and not worth the money. Her career ended with Ray of Light and everything else is now just making CD's just to make them knowing it will sell because her name is attached to it. Also her loose butt flapping in the Hung Up video didn't help
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This is NOT a Tool CD. If you need Tool, buy a Tool CD. (They should have a new one out in about 4-5 years).  <br />This is not Mer de Norms (Thank God). If you need Mer De Norms, buy it. <br />What this is is a work of art, a creation of a group of artists who clearly aren't interested in making the same album over and over. If that is what you want see \\"Boston.\\" If you have an open mind and enjoy undefined rock, then you have found gold. At times this album rocks harder than anything I've heard. See \\"Outsider.\\" Its one of those albums (like \\"The Fragile,\\" that needs to be heard a number of times bfore the genius reveals itself. And with each listen it only gets better. Though I don't like waiting for Maynard-involved CD's they lately have been well worth the wait. If you don't like this album, perhaps you need recovery yourself.
B000BO0LLS|1.0|It says somthing when you have to re release and album 4 times just to get it to sell. I have a copy of this album. There are only 3 good songs, the rest are just manufactered strictly for the radio. This album has nothing to with anyone or anything being emancipated. everysingle song is about her heart being broken and her losing a lover. No creativity what so ever. mariah carey is not a true artists, only a product of the music industry used to make record companys more money. Dont buy this album, dont be stupid and fall for this dumb gimmick!
0140177396|3.0|At only 107 pages \\"Of Mice and Men\\" is a short but to the point book. The story goes though the feelings about the ups and downs of relationships and how far they will go until someone breaks. Lennie and George are the main characters. Lennie is mentally Challenged, and really big and strong. George really wants to pursue \\"The American Dream\\" also he is kind of tells Lennie what to do, to keep out of trouble. I like George a lot; he is the smarter of the bunch. But I do not like Lennie at all; he does things that I don't really agree with. The story has much detail but yet is short enough to be a novel. The characters are not the smartest of all people. The book is okay in my opinion, not one of my favorites because I didn't feel it had a good pull on you, but the ending is what saved it, it has a totally unexpected twist of an ending. <br /> <br />brandon_m  <br />
0743454537|5.0|This was a great book.  I wasn't sure what to expect or if I would would stay interested since I am a big Dan Brown fan and this is a very different type of novel, but this was just as suspenseful in a very dramatic way.  I had to know what was going to happen and how it would turn out.  The author really gets you involved with this family and each character tugs you with their perspective, almost trying to sway the reader to their side.  This book, which I just picked up out the the grocery store to have something to read on a plane trip, has made me a Jodi Picoult fan too.  I have also read \\"The Pact\\", and am reading \\"Vanishing Acts\\".  They are all good reading.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|Back a few months ago when Mezmerize hit stores, being a rabid System of a Down fan I snatched it up as fast as possible. Mezmerize was also the biggest disappointment this band ever put out in my opinion. I felt that album was lazy and hollow.  <br /> <br />I figured that Mezmerize was the future track in which System was heading musically, so as the release date for Hypnotize approached, I was really not that interested in buying it. I then heard the title track \\"Hypnotize\\" on the radio and was completely sold. \\"Hypnotize\\" was one of the best songs I had ever heard by the band. I ran out, bought the CD and was ecstatic when I heard it first blast out of my stereo.  <br /> <br />Hypnotize is, in my opinion, the best System album. It retains the unique hyper and heavy essence of their previous releases, and incorporates the more melodic path the band seems to want to go.  It's progression that works, and works incredibly well.  <br /> <br />Here's how I rank the songs: <br /> <br />Attack: 3 out of 5 ~ Not the best track on the album, but a great opener, really grabs the attention. <br /> <br />Dreaming: 5 out of 5 ~ One of my favorites, incredibly layered, constantly changing, just fantastic. <br /> <br />Kill Rock'n  Roll: 5 out 5 ~ Catchy, short and sweet.  <br /> <br />Hypnotize: 10 out of 5 ~ Sometimes keeping things simple can produce some powerful results. Tied with \\"Science\\" from Toxicity as my favorite songs they have ever done. <br /> <br />Stealing Society: 5 out of 5 ~ I love how this track changes up in the middle to go off with a early punk-ish style. <br /> <br />Tentative: 5 out of 5 ~ Love the chorus and general flow of this song. <br /> <br />U-Fig: 3 out of 5 ~ Good track, but not really as up to par as the others. <br /> <br />Holy Mountains: 5 out of 5 ~ As great as everyone says it is. <br /> <br />Vicinity of Obscenity: 5 out of 5 ~ Probably the most insane thing I have ever heard. Love the funk guitar in the chorus. <br /> <br />She's Like Heroin: 4 out of 5 ~ For some reason this reminds me of something Danny Elfman would do.  <br /> <br />Lonely Day: 3 out of 5 ~ Not a bad song, just doesn't stand out as much as the others. <br /> <br />Soldier Side: 10 out of 5 ~ Incredibly good.

B000AY74OG|5.0|From an adult perspective, this is just another overblown glorified silly cartoon.  It's fun and it's funny, and there are some adult-humor moments sprinkled throughout to keep mom and dad's attention, but basically it's kiddie humor, and that's fine; my 8-year-old daughter would give this movie 5 stars on its own. <br /> <br />The thing that sets the \\"Madagascar\\" DVD apart is its extras.  Not only does it have the requisite \\"making of\\" featurette and the much-ballyhooed Christmas short starring the military penguins, it also has various features that even include a game of \\"Whack-a-Foosa.\\"  This is clearly not just any old DVD.
0062502182|5.0|The Alchemist is an easy read and contains as much wisdom as books that are ten times it's size. It can only have been inspired work and like all inspired works, it is inspiring. It's simple, profound and chuck full of meaning.<br /><br />The story is pleasant and flows quickly and naturally. As I read it, I had moments that in the coaching world we like to call \\"a-ha\\" moments. These weren't intellectual moments, but rather experiencial moments. Each time the \\"a-ha\\" came it was like a cord was struck within me. These cords were singing recognitions of the truth to a place deep within me.<br /><br />Before you roll your eyeballs and head for the nearest information highway on ramp, give me a chance to explain. This is not just feel good stuff; it's a parable of life and living well. If you are looking for something in your life, and I mean anything, this book will inspire you to find it. It will make you understand that if you want to live a great life, you can do that by following your dreams. And, if you think you don't have a dream, The Alchemist will show you that you've only forgotten it.<br /><br />Let me give you an example of the brilliance of this book. It even contains a metaphor for what's great about the book. Chase your tail on that one! Remember that commercial about the Sistine Chapel on the head of a pin? Let me expound upon this.<br /><br />Santiago, the book's main character says, \\"I learned that the world has a soul, and that whoever understands that soul can also understand the language of things. I learned that many alchemists realized their Personal Legends, and wound up discovering the Soul of the World, the Philosopher's Stone and the Elixir of Life.\\"<br /><br />He goes on to say that \\"above all, I learned that all of these things are so simple that they could be written on the surface of an emerald.\\" (Page 83)<br /><br />It turns out that what is written on the Emerald Tablet is a picture or a code. And, the code \\"can't be understood by reason alone,\\" says the Alchemist to Santiago later in the book. (Page 127) He goes on to point out that it can be understood by immersing yourself in the world, within your current environment or within any environment you wish. Everything in the world can teach you about the meaning of life.<br /><br />The Alchemist is the Emerald Tablet. It helps you get in touch with your experience of life by identification. It keeps you from living too much in your head or in the world of thinking about life. It puts you smack dab into getting out there to exerience life. It's simple message is live life to it's fullest in pursuit of what's most important to you and to you only and in doing so you will be contributing your part to the whole of humanity.nderstood by reason alone,\\" says the Alchemist to Santiago later in the book.

B000AL730O|4.0|Now, it's great being someone who goes down as melodist of the century - and you've got to be at least Van Leeuwen (an alternative music protagonist reviewer on Het Parool paper staff) to actually dare NOT like a balanced out small homespun warm-tinged peaceful album like that which means no harm, trespasses no territories and rakes none's hearing, right? Or is down there any one straight minded reviewer who does not embrace the album with at least 4 stars? Well, I rate it 4 for same fear of losing face whereas frankly it'd've been 3 were it coming from KEANE (the closest styled act I can think of at the moment). The reason for my lukewarm attitude to this one Macca is that:   1. It lacks any surefire \\"In The Back Seat Of My Car\\"-like complexity/ambition/arrangement, sheer diversity of RAM album.  2. It smacks of his latterdate prefab albums which spell no time nor difference regardless of producer hiking  3.  It actually has no vertues (other than cute clean playing/composing skills which need not be proved) except for ones listed above.   4. It falls short of being ingenious, and tunes are nothing much either. Ringo's latest is by far superior and prophetic.  5. I happen to own a Russian pressing (on Gala Records label though by Uden Plant, Holland) which is severely robbed of dynamics and narrow-staged. None of original fault...
B0006SSOHM|5.0|First off I guess I should explain the title to me review. Well you see this was one of a very few movies that I didn't have figured out before the end. I was genuinely suprized at the end,that don't happen to me much. Thats one of the main things I liked about this movie also it has some creative ideas on the whole genre. I mean before watching this movie who would have ever thought of killing people in that manner. The acting is pretty standard for the genre so I won't comment on that any further. So if your looking for a Suspenseful Horror flick you must watch this.
B000002GK1|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums. I lent it to someone and just got it back, and now I like it even more. To that kid who said he's happy that grunge is dead - Rock n roll is rock n roll. I comes in many forms, and this CD proves it. You can hear traces of AC/DC and Black Sabbath in this CD - I'm not sure if the kid who did the other review ever heard of those bands. This is a great album. There's great riffs, lyrics, and some of the best songs I've heard. To those Mudvayne, Shadows Fall, and Linkin Park fans, get a CD like this and develop some real taste. Long live Rock and Roll!
0385484518|4.0|\\"Death ends a life, not a relationship\\" (Albom, pg#).  These are just some of the  <br />words uttered under a fading man's breath.  A well deserved five stars is given to Mitch Albom and his compelling book, Tuesdays with Morrie.  Mitch Albom and Morrie  <br />Schwartz:  this student and teacher were over looking both the past and present of their  <br />lives.  Morrie, going on from the only place that he can takes in the beauty of life with an  <br />old friend that has come back for one more class.  Even though Mitch gives great detail  <br />on Morrie's life, he fails to touch upon what roles the people in his life had on him, a  <br />long with any influence anyone else had on Morrie; the meaning of life is followed  <br />through the fading life of Morrie, were many can relate.   <br /> Morrie being involved with a lot in his life gave him friends were good fortune  <br />and much more followed.  Being able to face his mother's death at a young age set  <br />Morrie up to be an optimistic man who enjoyed the finer things in the world that he loved.   <br />For a man so humorous and intelligent, it was hard for anyone to not like him for who he  <br />was, for what he stood for, redundant for whom he was. He always looked on the brighter  <br />side of things even with the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) trapping Morrie inside  <br />of himself.  Morrie, a friend to whom teaching was not a job but a learning experience, he  <br />never looked at a moment with one perspective but many.  <br /> It bugged me that throughout almost two hundred pages of this sentimental  <br />book that they just about only talked of Morrie and some of Mitch. What about Morrie's  <br />wife and son; what about the other people who made an impact on Morrie?  Mitch  <br />mentioned in the book about one of Morrie's best friends, but what happened to any of his newer friends?  Where are they in this book?  Understanding problems, like Morrie's  <br />wife not wanting to be mentioned but what about the ones if any that wanted to be in the  <br />midst of Morrie and his last days.  Morrie had lots of friends, Convinced of that, why was  <br />it that not one was talked about?  Describing the therapists, the way they looked, the way  <br />they acted towards Morrie, it seemed like a nice but dry kind of bond that they shared.   <br />What else did Mitch Albom not talk about, in this no doubt mind-caching true story.   <br />Anyone reading this book can more likely relate to some of the topics being  <br />discussed.  The main topic that is thrown about quite frequently was \\"life.\\"  Morrie liked  <br />to talk about how most people just living their life's show no sine of comprehension of  <br />life around them and what's in front of them.  Morrie's positive thought on life is an  <br />inspiration to every one.  Inspiration, if not had its given, if had it becomes greater, with  <br />this story you gain so much, out of the different topics discussed the mind swells with  <br />new life.  Morrie's teaching with the illness showed that with a great weight on his back  <br />he went on dealing with life.  Teaching Mitch how people react to death and the meaning  <br />it had behind it was just one thing Morrie had talked about.   <br />It's amazing to know someone who looks at life as so few do, to just stop and  <br />soak in the world around.  Morrie being that someone could just sit back and take it  <br />for what it was, for whatever it may have been.  The ones that knew Morrie and for  <br />the hundreds that filet like they knew him, \\"Coach\\" has touched us all and forever  <br />changed us.  Mitch has shown us that there are beauties of this planet that are neglected  <br />until we as people can look past our own lives and grasp what's in front of us.   To  <br />appreciate Morrie now after he has passed on is not a shame but an experience that now  <br />everyone can share for decades to come. <br />
B000BKJ78U|1.0|Just repackaging the 2004 GCI-crap fest, eh George?  Nice.

B000B2YQX4|5.0|Like the professional review written, this is almost a perfect album that sinks it's teeth into the roots of Depeche Mode's beginning.   <br /> <br />For me personally, it took a little bit of time and a couple spins of the cd to make me realize where the music took me back to.  I love the commercial side of their music, but there is something about the dark and more industrial side to them that keeps me and other fans desiring to hear anything that rolls out from the band.   <br /> <br />Playing the Angel is exactly what it says on the back cover \\"Pain and suffering in various tempos\\".  One song may hit you at a specific moment while others carry the tempo.  Then another will hit you and take you to a different place. <br /> <br />It is worth the money and getting back to the roots of Depeche Mode!

Check out the bitterness and scorn in \\"You're a big girl now\\" a seeming litany of simple, almost cliched lines that build into a climax of anguish, to the point where you feel just like the narrator with the \\"corkscrew to my heart\\" at song's end... <br /> <br />or check out the fractured narrative of the brilliant and unsurpassable \\"Tangled Up in Blue\\", the cinematic, larger than life \\"Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts\\" - you literally hang on every line, in expectation of the denouement, no matter how many times you've heard it.  <br /> <br />I could go on...every song here's at the very top of the Dylan canon... <br /> <br />(BTW, the top 5 Dylan albums are \\"Bringing it...\\", \\"Highway 61\\",\\"Blonde on Blonde\\", this, and \\"Time Out of Mind\\"....)

B00005JKOI|3.0|Another John Hughes written film, though directed by Howard Deutch. The 3rd in 3 years, thus completing the 80's teen trilogy (\\"16 Candles\\" in 1984, and \\"The Breakfast Club\\" in 1985). \\"Pretty In Pink\\" succeeds in several areas (Ringwald and Cryer are great together), but fails in comparison to the other 2 movies mentioned above. \\"16 Candles\\" was filled with bust-a-gut laughs with extremely memorable lines and characters (Long Duck Dong made this movie). \\"The Breakfast Club\\" was also filled with humor, but delt with several serious universal issues that teens deal with at the high school level (at school as well as at home). \\"Pink\\" deals with clashes between classes... a poor girl likes a rich guy and what happens along the way is what this movie is about. Not that there's anything wrong with that... but \\"Pink\\" just isn't in the same league as it's 2 predecessors. Molly Ringwald is basically the same kid you've seen before... just a tad more sad and depressed about who she is and the poor hand she's been delt in life. Jon Cryer's character (Duckie) is off the wall funny and just looking for acceptance by Ringwald (Andie) throughout the entire movie. Andrew McCarthy is the other co-star as the rich kid (Blain) daring to go across the tracks to tangle with Andie. The DVD has the restored movie - but, NO bonus features. That's a negative in my book. Commentaries, gag reels, deleted scenes, behind the scenes, even a short interview with the stars years later would have been cool. Nada - Zip - Zilch.
B00097A5I6|1.0|To think someone like  Noel Gallaghar who wrote such amazing songs as \\"Live Forever\\" \\"Wonderwall\\" \\"Supersonic\\" \\"Morning Glory\\" and \\"Champagne Supernova\\" could settle for this rehashed crappy 60s sounding collection of lifeless songs is a mystery. <br /> <br />Oasis have gone down hill artistically with \\"Heathen Chemistry\\", and album that is the so called return to their days of when they were the biggest thing since sliced bread, the problem was it sounds like them trying to do pale retreads of their previous work, and while \\"The Hindu Times\\" and \\"Stop Crying You Heart Out\\" and \\"Born on a different cloud\\" still showed that Oasis had some juice left. The rest of the album left alot to be desired, filled with pointless and nonsesical tracks such as \\"She is Love\\" \\"Betterman\\" and \\"Probably all in the mind\\". <br /> <br />The last Oasis album they made an artistic effort was  with \\"Standing on the Shoulder of giants\\" no comparison to their better albums but still good, and while they are not a band like \\"Radiohead\\" who re invent the wheel, its the music that gave Oasis's songs the life, not just lyrics and trying to repeat what you've already done. <br /> <br />Pick Oasis the worst song from Definitley Maybe \\"Digsys Dinner\\" <br />Morning Glory \\"Hey Now!\\" <br />Be Here Now \\"Don't Go Away\\" <br />Standing on the Shoulder of giants \\"I can see a liar\\" <br />Heathen Chemistry \\"She Is Love\\" <br />and you already almost have half an album that kicks this drab one (\\"erm\\" Don't Beleive the Truth)for a six.
0553801503|2.0|There is not much that advances the story here. Over 25% of the book deals with Cersei and Arya's story seems to be a second thought.  <br /> <br />The development of the Iron Born was terrific... but Brienne and Jaime's stories offered very little that was interesting. <br /> <br />This was advertised as 'All the story of half the characters ' a reasonable approach by my thinking. Unfortunately, it ends the novel with stories unfinished... here is the issue with that... we have to wait for him to finish 'Dance with Dragons' before he even STARTS the book that may (or may not) finish the characters from this one.  <br /> <br />Jordan lost me after the 7th book in The Wheel of Time (I should have stopped after book 5) and Goodkind lost me during Faith of the Fallen... depending on how long I wait for 'Dance,' Martin may have lost me here. <br />
B0000646UN|4.0|it is the business of the artist to follow it home to the heart of the individual fighters-not to talk in armies and nations and numbers-but to track it home.  D.H. Lawrence    The Russo-Finnish War, known as \\"The Winter War\\", began on November 30, 1939 when the Red Army invaded Finland.  The war began after the Finns refused demands from Stalin to move its borders 25 kilometers back from Leningrad.  The basis for this demand was the fear on the part of Stalin and the Soviet High Command that Hitler could launch an invasion of the USSR directed at Leningrad using Finland as a base for its attack.  The Winter War ended by means of a truce signed on March 12, 1940.  During this brief three-month war a Finnish army consisting of 180,000 men, most of them reservists waged a defensive battle against an advancing Soviet army of about 450,000 men.  Fighting from entrenched positions against full-frontal assaults resulted in the death of close to 23,000 Finnish soldiers.  At the same time more than 126,000 Soviet soldiers were killed or missing and another 264,000 were wounded.  This short war had a dramatic impact on the future course of the Second World War (the Winter War took place during the `phony war' period between the occupation of Poland and the commencement of Germany's invasion of France).  The horrifying losses suffered by the Red Army were a reflection of the chaos caused by purges of the military that practically eliminated every professional officer from the Red Army.  This vulnerability could only have encouraged Hitler in making his decision to invade the USSR in June 1941. Finnish film director Pekka Parikka's 1989 film \\"The Winter War\\" is an exceptionally well made movie about this little-known (at least to me) war. The film is not about armies fighting armies as much as it is about the individual fighters who, collectively, are called upon to wage war against an invading army.    Parikka's film follows the war through the eyes of a small platoon of reservists called up from their village to fight the war.  It begins with their mobilization and their trip to the front lines through three months of brutal and bloody fighting.  The film appears to be very accurate from a historic perspective.  The reservists are shown being issued incomplete, if any, uniforms, and finding gear and supplies when and if they can.  The Finns, lacking in anti-tank weaponry invented the Molotov Cocktail to use against Soviet mechanized divisions and the film shows these ad hoc weapons being used to great effect.  Particularly well done are the scenes that show the impact of the war on the rather stoic inhabitants of the platoon's village.    The Winter War is a straight-forward narrative of the war and how it was fought. It has a particular emphasis on the ugly reality of war.  It is not for the squeamish.   The film is not an examination of the souls or characters of the people that fought the war. This is true even of the principal actors.  The characters in the film are involved in fighting a war, they are not there to engage in discussions of the meaning of life.  However, I thought the film was very well done and certainly worth watching.  Those with an interest in war films generally or interested in well made films that cover corners of our history that is not overly familiar to them should find this a rewarding film to watch.  I've seen plenty of movies about the D-Day landings, the Battle of the Bulge, and the like.  This is the first film I've seen on the Russo-Finnish war.     A word about the price.  This DVD contains no extra features and is not in letterbox format.  Although it is an excellent movie I cannot advise anyone to buy it at the current list price of $45.00.  I purchased a new copy through an Amazon marketplace vendor and paid 1/3 of the list price.  At that price it is a 5-star film.  At the list price I think the viewer may feel that he has paid a bit too much. That is ultimately why I rated this film 4 stars andnot 5.      L. Fleisig
B000BVD460|5.0|It's great to pick this one up for the holidays, I think this is one where the clean version might outsell the uncensored version for the soccer moms driving the kids to school...  <br /> <br />\\"When I'm Gone\\" more or less explains his retirement. Patching things up with Kim in the papers, the perscription drug dependency, and the \\"going out on top\\", and a contract obligation for a \\"hits\\" package so he can get himself together.  <br /> <br />It's not in chronological order, and the more serious songs are balanced out with the more funny ones.  <br /> <br />Overall it's a great CD, but the shortcomings are that he's taking straight from his CDs and excluded the stuff from D-12 and Dre that were on the radio. Also a significant amount of favorites didn't make it on here. Might have been worth making it into a 2 CD set instead of the \\"mixtape\\". Maybe there will be a \\"Vol 2\\". It's a lot of material in a short period of time to put out a hits, but considering a lot of faves are left out, it's a justified reason to put one out.  <br /> <br />While Em goes into \\"retirement\\" (like Jay-Z who is anything but retired), you can bet he's got enough material in the vaults to play housedad until the kids are out of the house. Hopefully he'll have a \\"rarities\\" collection and DVD that has it all in one place.  <br /> <br />Recommended for: Casual listeners of his music that had never bought his CDs and consider him a guilty pleasure. The big fans will pick this one up for the new cuts, but more likely will make their own \\"hits\\".
B00006M183|2.0|Apart from \\"The Manic Street Preachers\\" and \\"Supergrass\\", \\"Pearl Jam\\" are one of the few artists who are making music for the sake of \\"artisticness\\". <br /> <br />While many just don't get it, and think Eddie Vedder should sing like he did on other records and the band should pull out riffs and hooks, \\"yes, that Rolling Stone review nailed it on the head, on the previous review\\", the choruses fall into place in the song instead of doing the in the studio, in your face effect, genius! <br /> <br />Overall, the stongest Pearl Jam album as whole, but \\"Vitolagy\\" and \\"No Code\\" would have to stand as the bands most accomplished artistic efforts.
B000BMSTMS|3.0|First off all i thought that this was goin to be a Korn album but when i started to listen to ther songs after twisted transistor i found out that it wasnt a rock album more like a techno album this band needs to get another guitarist to replace head to actually be rock and not techno rap, this album had alot of potential, but it was just a let down the only reason i give it 3 stars is that there is some rock to be found on this album but thats only like 4 songs, ever since they started to song with rap artists its been downhill, they need to go back to there roots, Head was the leader of this group you can tell with the absence of his awsome guitar riffs and melodies, with all this emo crap comin onto the scene we need a rock group to step up and grab that sh*t by the balls and i was hoping Korn would do it but they failed, failed horribly i dont want to hear an experimental sound i want to hear music not crap thats reserved for rap, the only thing that came out of this is that they need a new guitarist to take up the slack that Head left behind, I was goin to see these guys live but i am glad now that i didnt waste the money to go see these sellouts.
B000B7BRMM|4.0|Oh, the pressures of the holiday season! We all have our crazy little personal rules & traditions. When it comes to Christmas music, I've always had a hard and fast rule not to buy or listen to Xmas music until after turkey day (Thanksgiving). Yes, I know thats pretty stupid, but it's just a survival tactic to keep from getting sick of the same old tunes over & over again too soon. Imagine my consternation, when Verve released Diana Krall's latest album \\"Christmas Songs\\" on November 1. Now, normally being a huuuuggge fan of Mrs. Krall (or is it Costello?) I would be the first person in line at my local impersonal, big box store to pick her latest release. But it was a Christmas album and I have, that really stupid personal rule. So for close to a month I held out, even though every time I was in a CD store I had to come face to face with, that cover with the sexy pose (Boy, have Xmas album covers changed since I was a kid!). Well, I finally purchased this CD and I've got say \\"Christmas Songs\\" was definitely worth the wait. Diana has return to form (after the interesting experimentation of \\"The Girl in the Other Room\\") and presented us with a delicious holiday treat! I think this is a recording that many Krall fans have been hoping would be released for a long time. This might be, because over the years we have been teased with Christmas EPs, bonus tracks and jazz compilations, that have hinted at what Diana could do with a Christmas tune. Because of this, I think expectations of an Xmas album have been unreasonably high. Having said that, let me up front say, that this is a very good CD. In fact its a wonderful CD. But take my advice. If you really want to enjoy this album as a listening experience, skip the first two songs. Let me explain. While I really like this CD, I think parts of it are marred by the arrangements and over powering sound of the Clayton/Hamilton Orchestra. While I commend Diana for trying new things like a big band sound, I don't think some of the arrangements on the louder, more upbeat tunes, mix well with her style. This is particulary evident in the first two songs, \\"Jingle Bells\\" & \\"Let it Snow\\". While Diana's singing is robust and enthusiastic (love the \\"I love horses\\" line on \\"Jingle Bells\\") it almost sounds like she is competing with the loud orchestra just to be heard. So frankly, to help the listening experience, I've now been starting the CD at the third track. It's just better that way, trust me. Now, I don't want sound too negative in this review and leave you with the wrong impression. This is a very good album especially, when the songs are given a more of an intimate feeling. On something like Mel Torme's classic tune, \\"The Chistmas Song\\" it sounds like your alone with Diana and the Yule log and shes softly crooning directly to you. Yep, it's definitely a grown-up Christmas. The same feeling is pronounce in her wonderfully, sexy reading of \\"I'll be Home for Christmas\\". When she croons the words \\" if only in my dreams\\" , where she takes that extra breath, it makes me feel like a marshmellow melting in a mug of hot chocolate (O.K. its a fantasy, just leave at that!). If I had to pick the best cut of the CD it would hands down have to be the Vince Guaraldi/Bill Mendelson song, \\"Christmas Time is Here\\". Yes, I'm not exactly impartial, because this wintery tune was engraved on my brain with about a zillion childhood, holiday viewings of the classic, 'A Charlie Brown Christmas', television special. But Diana brings a freshness and an especially nostalgic, wistfulness to the song and it's images, that is just so gratifying. Makes me want to run outside and catch snowflakes on my tongue (Yes, the above address reads Florida)! Other wonderful tracks include such classics as \\"White Christmas\\" and a very sexy \\"Have Youself a Merry little Christmas\\". They are all just so good. So, don't waste anymore time. Buy this CD and have a great holiday with Diana Crooning in your ear! Highly recommended!he arrangements on the louder, more upbeat tunes, mix well with her style.

B000BKJ78U|5.0|The only reason people are rating this package low is because it's not the original cut. A lot of people are just copying the early-mid 90s laserdiscs to DVD at this point.  <br /> <br />I do think that they should have given the customers the individual versions like Coppola did with \\"Godfather\\", and maybe George will, but also keep in mind 2 years from now is the 30th anniversary of \\"Star Wars\\". Spielberg gave in on \\"ET\\" with 2 versions for a bit (although I think he has the revamped version on market now). If the originals are released, it'll be around that time and prob. as part of a huge package to get people on board hi def DVD.  <br /> <br />I've watched the revamped trilogy more than once and still enjoy it as much as the untouched version, but the 4 disc set has a really good documentary about the making of (watch \\"Lost in La Mancha\\" to see a movie made by Terry Gilliam in the desert that failed miserably...Lucas wasn't that far off back when). If you're not the type to lose sleep over \\"Han shot first\\", want to save a few bucks and aren't the type to watch \\"making ofs\\", this is worth it because it is still one of the best trilogies ever made.

B00005JMJG|5.0|I guess the moral of the story is that good memories really do outweigh the bad. The merging of two stories in one is brilliant. On one story, you have a man (Jim) who had a bad relationship and wants his memory of her erased, but during the proceedure he discovers that he loves her and doesn't want the memories gone. Then the other story envolves those who are erasing Joel's memory and the conflicts they exchange while doing their job.<br /><br />I really do enjoy this film and think it's one of Jim Carrey's best. I think this surpases my other favorite JC drama \\"The Majestic\\". Jim Carrey just proves once again that even though he is known for his comedy roles, he can also be fantastic actor in other genres as well.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|This is the way Let It Be was intended to sound, warm, not so perfect and human, however i gotta be honest, Phil Spector over produced arrangments, orchestation and chorus never were quite unpleasant for me that was the \\"Let It Be\\" of my memories after all. <br />This new \\"Let It Be\\" release is refreshing, Lennon and Mcartney always complained for the job the producer they choosed for this did, they were searching for a simple sound for this songs because they wanted to keep the mood that the film with the same name had, some sort of documentary with a few rehearsals, conversations between the four Beatles, and the creative process to be captured both on film and tape, the film acomplished the mission but an extra surprise element were evident also, the constant tension between Lennon, Mcartney and Harrison,(Starr always keept a distance in this particular process)and the disagreements, fights and the chaos that Let It Be involved, Beatles couldnt keep togheter any longer, as a matter of fact they had only one year ahead with \\"Abbey Road\\" their final album. <br />Let It Be didnt acomplished with the concept that Beatles were searching, Spector (maybe with good intention) included many elements, perhaps too much,  to try to make of this album a monumental piece of work but there were no need of that, Beatles had already made some albums in that line and this time they wanted something different, something more raw, they were not pleased with that and took more than 30 years to release the album that Lennon and Mcartney dreamed, maybe too late for many Beatles fans but the rest of us had the luck to enjoy this album from its original perspective. <br /> <br />You can enjoy Let It Be version of 1970 or this newest version , booth albums are awesome. <br /> <br />HM               <br /> <br />
B00000DC10|5.0|This cd has set the standard for hardcore political punk. Words really cannot describe the energy and emotion that literally pour off of this album. If you like Refused's other works, than you will love this. If you have never listen to Refused before, definately start with this. This is a much more mature album than Songs to Fan  the Flames of Revolution. Even if you don't like hardcore music, the messages on this cd can really apply to anyone. <br /> <br />In my opinion, this is one of the overall best cds created in the past 15 years. No other band has really equaled the level that Refused attained on this album.

0393035158|3.0|A friend of mine (who grew up in the Soviet Union) once told me that PROPAGANDA  <br />worked by ADDING a couple of INCORRECT STATEMENTS to a set of FACTS to attempt  <br />to lead one to a totally FLAWED CONCLUSION. <br /> <br />It is a pity that this book does just that; I did like the reasoning used against religion <br />(which is why I gave it a 3 star rating), however the book fails miserably on other fronts. <br /> <br />SUICIDE BOMBINGS: <br />Suicide bombings were started by the Tamils (in their POLITICAL movement to get autonomy in Sri Lanka).  <br /> <br />As per Wikipedia, The Tamil Tigers were, as of 2000, \\"unequivocally the most effective and brutal <br /> terrorist organization ever to utilize suicide terrorism\\" (according to Yoram Schweitzer  <br />of the Institute for Counter-Terrorism in Israel) <br /> <br />So, people kill themselves for political beliefs just as often as for religious beliefs. <br /> <br /> <br />GENOCIDE: <br />Probably the biggest genocides in history were the Germans murdering 8 million Jews (cultural hatred), <br />Stalin killing millions of Ukranian farmers (communism) and Mao killing millions of Chinese (communism). <br /> <br />In the latter half of the 20th century, the biggest genocides were: <br /> <br />- Bangladesh 1971 (3 million people killed by fellow Sunni Moslems) <br />- Cambodia 1975-1978 (1.7 million people, communism) and <br />- Rwanda 1994 (1 million killed in 90 days, a political struggle between Hutus and Tutsis, both sides Christian) <br /> <br />So the biggest genocides in the 20 century were for political and cultural reasons. <br /> <br /> <br />WARS: <br />WWI and WWII (which were easily the biggest slaughters in history) had nothing to do with religion <br /> <br /> <br />FINALLY: <br />I take offense to Harris' description of 'collateral damage' as not being deliberate; war is messy and anytime <br />one sends planes and troops to invade countries like Iraq, one is guaranteed thet most casualties will be <br />innocents (which is WHY one needs to choose to go to war only as a last resort). <br /> <br />And while I agree that the US does not deliberately target civilians, they suffer from an attitude almost as <br />bad... they do not care <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />CONCLUSION: <br />Yes religion is a basis for war and murder. Unfortunately people will find reasons to kill each other <br />long after religion becomes extinct. <br /> <br />It is unfortunate that books like like this will contribute to even more conflict in the future. <br /> <br />It appears that most people who have liked this book are people who have never had Moslem friends and have never <br />realized that they are people just like all of us; I am not talking about backward people in mountains who are the <br />same no matter what their religion (or country, yes including the US). <br /> <br /> <br />There are any amount of fallacies in this book and I would advise readers to be selective.
0393317552|4.0|Jared Diamond addresses issues of evolution and racism in his Pulitzer Prize winning book Guns, Germs, and Steel.  His background in medicine and biology and his Ph. D. in physiology, combined with his abilities as a linguist, allow him to approach the reasons behind humans varying rates of advancement from many different angles.  Diamond uses a conversational tone to explain the logical reasons for the facts he presents.  He explains that the reason people of Eurasia, as opposed to people in North America or Australia, domesticated the most  animals was because they had the most candidates capable of domestication.  He follows the path of several societies at once comparing the haves and have nots of each.  He uses leading questions such as \\"why did food production develop first in these seemingly marginal lands, and only later in today's most fertile farmlands and pastures?\\" Questions like this usually take several chapters to answer as he continues to ask more making it seem like a constant introduction for the first third of the book. <br />His final conclusion is essentially a matter of being in the right place at the right time.  Native Americans and Aboriginees lacked the domesticable plants and animals they needed to settle down and develop guns, germs, and steel.  History shows that if left on their own these societies would probably have settled down and when modern day primitive people were presented with agriculture and technology they usually take full advantage of it. <br />
B000B8QF14|3.0|im a very casual green day fan, this was the first release from them that ive ever purchased, i was pretty familiar with most of the songs though from hearing nthem on the radio. <br /> <br />i realize that at 40 years old im probably twice the age(at least) of many GD fans, but these guys do have some catchy tunes. <br /> <br />i bought this release mostly for the dvd, which is good, but is held back by having the documentary(interviews) parts mixed in with the concert, its nice to have those, but they should have been seperate from the show, i would like to see the show just as it ran live. <br /> <br /> <br />talentwise, these guys aint led zeppelin, none of them blow me away by thier playing talents, yet like i said, somehow they make it work and put out some good tunes. <br />

B0009F9O6W|5.0|VDGG offered up a unique blend of \\"regular\\" symphonic prog, like labelmates Genesis, and a much harder, almost metallic-edged version of prog more akin to King Crimson.  One minute the acoustic guitar, piano and Peter Hammill's dramatic vocals are lulling you into bliss and the next minute Hugh Banton's ferocious Hammond and Dave Jackson's skronking multi-tracked (and sometimes multi-played!) saxes are blasting you out of your seat.<br /><br />Pawn Hearts was their first full album without a full-time bass player, which goes virtually unnoticed given Banton's fluency with the bass pedals of his Hammond, and the skill of drummer Guy Evans in filling in the rhythms.  Often cited as VDGG's best record, Pawn Hearts does not in any way disappoint.  Several years before Yes did Close to the Edge, VDGG set the template here with two long songs and one huge, glorious side-long epic, \\"A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers,\\" one of the must-have prog epics.  This re-issue has 20 minutes of bonus material, including alternate takes of the \\"Theme One\\"/\\"W\\" single.  The wonderfully concise \\"Theme One\\", written by Beatles producer George Martin, is a real keeper.  In an era when things like \\"Classical Gas\\" and \\"Hocus Pocus\\" could be hit singles, it's amazing to me that this tight, tuneful little prog instrumental wasn't a huge hit.<br /><br />The rest of the bonus tracks are culled from an aborted second album that was supposed to make Pawn Hearts a 2-record set, as is \\"Squid/Squid/Octopus\\" on the H to He reissue.  Mostly experimental tracks by the band members who didn't get much chance to write, they are interesting but prove just how invaluable Hammill's writing and vocals were to the band.<br /><br />VDGG could be very harsh and aggressive and just plain loud, and some people find Hammill's vocals overly melodramatic (those people would be wrong) but to me, this band epitomized prog at it's best.  Their musicianship, awesome sense of dynamics and headstrong experimentalism put them at the top of the prog heap.  Then there was the band's \\"signature,\\" when Hammill would phrase along directly with the band.  They did this often and those are my favourite moments on their albums.  Listen for it here, on \\"Plague of Lighthouse Keepers\\" during the \\"Presence of the Night\\" section!  While this band's entire discography is recommended, this one may just live up to the hype as their very best (just don't ask me when I'm listening to H to He!)<br /><br />This reissue series was personally supervised by the group, and all contain scrapbook-style booklets with liner notes, pictures and lyrics.

B000AARKOO|1.0|KOH is about as interesting as watching paint set. It is quite possibly one of the worst epics ever made. Considering that this is a Ridley Scott movie one has to beg the question - what on Earth did he think he was doing? Since the early 1990s Hollywood has been evading a movie about the Crusades... and now we can see why. An English blacksmith turns out to be the heir of a Jerusalem Knight and goes off there to find himself, only to replace his father and serve the King of Jerusalem who is having a hard time maintaining law and order in his own house while Muslims are knocking down his doors. Plotless, pointless and utterly boring, the fight sequences have been seen so many times before that you will just sleep your way into the end credits... and what a three hour nap it will be. For all the big names on display this really does leave much to be desired. Forget Gladiator or Troy. This one is clearly a no-brainer.

1594200440|4.0|Nadezhda and Vera's 84-year-old father Nikolai has been a widower for two years when the voluptuous Valentina bursts into his life, wagging her breasts at him in her quest for a Visa. Nikolai is besotted with this bleached-blonde Ukrainian some fifty years his junior--not least because she favors him with access to her superb bosom--and he is intent on becoming her savior by marrying her. Nikolai's daughters, needless to say, are less than happy with their father's plan to replace their mother--a woman who survived the German occupation of Ukraine in World War II, who understood what it meant to stave off starvation--with this boil-in-the-bag gold digger. But there is little they can do to combat their determined father, who squanders his pension and happiness on the woman before he comes around, sort of, to their way of thinking.<br /><br />Marina Lewycka's A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian follows the story of the eccentric--or half-mad--Nikolai's unhappy second marriage and his daughter's attempts to minimize Valentina's hold over him. Interspersed in the story are snippets from the book Nikolai is writing, the history of tractors that gives Lewycka's book its title. There are also excurses on Ukrainian history and the history of Nadezhda and Vera's family in particular.<br /><br />Lewycka's story is told from Nadezhda's perspective. She is ten years younger than her sister Vera and was born in entirely different circumstances, after the War had ended and her parents had made it to England. Her father's second marriage provides Nadezhda with the opportunity to dig up the truth about her family's past, the small dramas that her parents and sister kept hidden from the baby in the family by way of protecting her. In the end the book is more about what Nadezhda comes to understand about her family, in particular about her sister, than it is about the foolish extravagance of an old man. An interesting book for its unusual approach, and ultimately moving as Lewycka reveals how the sisters' very different experiences have come between them.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greececka reveals how the sisters' very different experiences have come between them.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece
B000002G87|5.0|I love this album. It's pure blues rock. So bittersweet and painful and soulful. The album was a template for a generation. <br /> <br />This will make most of you mad, but I compare this album in my own mind to Motley Crue's Dr. Feelgood. I think both describe the woes of different generations in their own special way. <br /> <br />Listen to both. Crossreference and compare. Am I stupid?
B000BMSTMS|4.0|After the release of \\"Take a look in the Mirror\\", I thought KoRn were not able to continue their evolution heard on Untouchables. But   it's not the case. Oh yes, you'll see a lot of angry \\"Heavy Metal fans\\" saying KoRn has turned into a pop music band. It's false: the  atmosphere on this album is really heavy, riffs are still here and the electronic programmation really kicks a**!    2 or 3 songs are not so good and guitars were better with \\"Head\\" (so 4 stars only) but in fact I would have rated this album 4.5 on 5!!!     KKKOOOORRRRRNNNNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!!!
B00008OLIC|5.0|This should get more play on classic rock radio. Motley Crue had pretty much given up being a mid-80s hairband and had  abandoned the whole leather, devil-worship image from the earliest days. Still there's prejudice against the Crue from rock n roll radio for whatever reason.<br /><br />I remember fondly being 13 years old in 1984 wearing the pentagram Crue tee shirts with my mullet and having people think I was a demonologist. Fun times.<br /><br />As far as this album goes, it's kind of the Layla of my generation. Pure classic rock. In a league of its own. Beyond mere metal. Still a favorite among strippers. That's about a perfect album.
B000BVD460|5.0|Eminem put this at the right time when he knew he was running out of hits.  But this is a phenomenal collection of some solid hip-hop.  The new songs like When I'm Gone are good, but Fack is a little funny and silly and should have been left out. The bulk of the album is full of one smash hit after the other, from Stan, to Cleaning out My Closest, the Oscar winning Lose Yourself, to the very catchy Without Me to Guilty Conscience to The Real Slim Shady to My Name Is and the rare live version of Stan with Elton John at the Grammys. Didn't like the monotonous Just Lose It from the sluggish sounding Encore album. Liked When I'm Gone and how his daughter Hailie is trying to prevent him from leaving home as he goes on a world concert tour. Mockingbird's another nice song to his daughter too.  Eminem mixes all kinds of emotions in his songs, from funny to controversial angry to out of control to positive and so forth. That's why he's such a strong lyricist and rapper. And he has his own kinds of beats, many times as hard hitting as his rap competition.  This will be a major seller during the Christmas holidays due to his four platinum selling albums before selling so huge before!
B000BVD460|5.0|Eminem rules overall... He's the best current rapper (well, a few years back... 50 Cent kinda dominates now)... But Eminem is one of the world's rappers, along with Tupac and Dre... <br /> <br />The New Songs: <br />FACK's a bit messed up, could have been better.  Shake That's all right, but not really Eminem material; I like the beat though.  When I'm Gone is a great song.   <br /> <br />The Hits: <br />Good choices overall, but I'd rather had put some other songs on there... Mockingbird is still my favorite of those songs, followed by Stan (ft. Dido). <br /> <br />Worth the buy... I have all of Eminem's CD, so this CD isn't much of an improvement... but it's great for new people or people who wants all the good songs all in one.
B0006399FS|4.0|How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb is a very decent U2 album.  It's worth the money (~$10 on Amazon).  It does include some classics, the fun Vertigo and the moving Sometime You Can't Make it on Your Own to name a few.  Overall it's solid and enjoyable.  Those who enjoy this album will be fans of U2 and/or those who appreciate diverse types of music.  Bono's voice is full of feeling and the melodies are very likeable.  This album does grow on you. <br /> <br />A true test of music is to listen to it performed live.  If it sounds good live, it's probably a good song.  Unlike many of the pop stars today U2's music stands the test of time and of being live.  No surprises here, listening to these songs in concert only enhanced my respect for the songs.  I now find myself listening to this album more than I did before.  U2's songs also sound more complete after hearing them live.  Even if you weren't able to grab a ticket, this music can still be easily appreciated. <br /> <br />1. Vertigo - 4/5 - A great tune.  An \\"Elevation II\\" of sorts, which doesn't speak badly about this song.  It's fun, fast and has a funny, vertigoish beginning.  Some great lines in the lyrics here. <br /> <br />2. Miracle Drug - 5/5 - A song I initially dismissed, which was a horrible mistake.  Turn your speakers up loud for this one.  It's very moving and has a beautiful melody.  The best of the album, in my opinion.  The intro is my favorite intro of any U2 song.  When listening to this one, let it play with your emotions and listen close.  Though Bono sings loud, don't let him scare you away; he is singing loud for a good reason. <br /> <br />3. Sometimes You Can't Make it On Your Own - 4/5 - Another moving song Bono dedicates to his Father.  The chorus is enchanting, but the rest of the song leaves me begging for more with the exception of the end (which is mostly comprised of a repeating chorus).  Nominated for `Song of the Year' by the guys at the Grammies.  It deserves a nomination, but not awin. <br /> <br />4. Love & Peace or Else - 4/5 - A song I also initially dismissed.  Turn up your speakers again and make sure you have a sub attached.  Certainly this is a distinctive song not to be ignored.  U2's \\"War\\" song for 2005. <br /> <br />5. City of Blinding Lights - 5/5 - Underrated.  Nominated for a Grammy and a song I never get tired of.  This song has amazing, meaningful and powerful lyrics.  A breakthrough performance for the band.  Very inspirational.  Keep those speakers loud for this one.  This will be a classic. <br /> <br />6. All Because of You - 4.5/5 - Underrated. Simply put, a great rock & roll song.  Listen, and you'll understand. <br /> <br />7. Man and a Woman - 1.5/5 - Leaves a lot to be desired.  It does deserve a 1.5 but not a 0.  A lot could have happened here, but it just never does.  Seems like an excuse for lyrics. <br /> <br />8. Crumbs from your Table - 2/5 - If I'm correct U2 admitted they wrote this while they were drunk.  Truly could have been much better.  A better chorus could've made this song into one of the best songs of U2's past couple of albums.  But, it just doesn't turn out that way. <br /> <br />9. One Step Closer - 1/5 - HELLO!  WAKE UP!  Maybe 1 is too low, but I feel like I'm getting high on a trip through nothing land.  No good sense of direction.  The melody doesn't work with Bono's voice.  I'm not a fan of this one.  The third and final disappointing track of the album. <br /> <br />10.Original of the Species - 4/5 - Would have gotten a 5/5 if they removed Bono's sentence \\"You are the first one of your kind.\\"  Without that annoying overly simple transition statement, this song is deep, rich and fun.  Bono said this is \\"probably one of the best songs of the album.\\"  Ehhh, maybe Bono.  It sure did sound good live, though. <br /> <br />11.Yahweh - 3/5 - Another great song live but feels weak on the album.  You want this song to succeed better then it does, but make no mistake, it doesn't let you down.  A decentending and probably a little underrated. <br /> <br />12. Fast Cars - 4/5 - [Not included with standard album] - Underrated, a great fun & different song that works very well.  Why did U2 leave this off their regular US albums?  I have no idea.  A bad mistake in my opinion.  Go download it if you can't get your hands on it. <br /> <br />Although I feel this album compliments All That You Can't Leave Behind (One reason being that it's name is also too long) it is also a much better album.  Elevation & Beautiful Day are the only two songs on that album I find myself listening to years after the release, whereas with Bomb I'll know I'll have at least 5 I'll still be addicted to. <br /> <br />Overall, a tracks 7, 8, and 9 can be ignored but the rest you can't live without.  I feel U2 came in second this year with How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb with Green Day's American Idiot taking the lead spot.  However How to Dismantle An Atomic Bomb offers a more diverse & satisfying play list. <br /> <br />To back up my review refer to the shows U2 has sold out on their Vertigo tour.  Speaking in terms of gross ticket sales for U2, they have DOMINATED worldwide.  No one even comes close.  Sorry, Green Day, U2 knocked you out in the concert department and How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb helped them deliver the goods.
B000002JNJ|5.0|I'm going to try to do this album some justice here.  Pantera's first album of the nineties was a transition for the band.  Having put out a few hair metal albums Pantera seemed to be a band with alot of talent but not a lot of direction... Enter Phil Anselmo. Replacing the first singer, Anselmo came in and brought a much needed jolt to the rest of the guys.  The result... Cowboys From Hell.  One of the most impressive and easily accesable thrash albums ever written.  Dimebag Darrell once was asked how he could describe his sound.  I think he sumed it up when he replied, \\"Power Groove.\\" This album is metal but it makes you wanna do more than just bang your head.  The urge to get up and trash the very room your in is almost impossible to diminish when this album is blasting through your speakers.  No album I have ever heard has such raw energy and agression.  Instrumentally this is Pantera's finest hour.  Dimebag Darrell needs no introduction. The rythym section of Rex Brown and Vinnie Paul are in top form, and this album prooves that Phil Anselmo  once could actually sing.  Any fan of metal that doesn't own this album is missing out terribly.     <br /> <br />Cowboys From Hell - One of Pantera's bigger hits, this song is the introduction to the new Pantera.  It Sets the table for a killer album. Pounding guitar riffs, killer lyrics and one of Dimebag's most difficult solos this song has it all.  After hearing this song most people are hooked on this album and It just gets better and better. <br /> <br />Primal Concrete Sledge - Great Drumming, Shredding riffs, Vocally could have been alot better.  If Phil Anselmo ever came close to rapping it was on this song. <br /> <br />Psycho Holiday - Classic Pantera tune, an underground favorite for all obvious reasons. <br /> <br />Heresy - Killer intro with harmonics. One of the better tunes on the album, Funny lyrics during the verses, so you can lick my... <br /> <br />Cemetery Gates - Hmmm, this is the song that got me into Pantera. It's definently one of the most recognizable songs of Pantera's catalog and arguably their biggest hit.  It grows old  after hearing it 28,000 times but it is still one of the greatests songs in all of metal and was a staple of Pantera's encore. <br /> <br />Domination - The title says it all! This song Dominates this album.  Unstopable.  I love everything about this song,  It starts out a killer onslaught of thrash and builds into one of the fastest solos around, all leading up to the heaviest riff known to man only to be followed by another killer guitar solo. Best song on this album hands down.(RIP Dimebag) <br /> <br />Shattered - Phil Anselmo shows why he was one of the best singers not just in heavy metal but in all or rock.  Belting out  falsetto squeels, at times he was an equal to Rob Halford . and if that wasn't good enough your privelaged to the fastest riffage since Disposable Heroes. <br /> <br />Clash with reality and Medicine Man - Are killer tunes with killer riffs, Sometimes I skip Medicine Man probably my least favorite on the album <br /> <br />Message With Blood- Awsome <br /> <br />The Sleep - My second favorite on the album, One of Dime's best solo's ever.  The quality of songs  doesn't drop off at all on this album.  <br /> <br />The Art of Shredding - F**king right! If shredding was an Art than Dime was f**king Picaso.  There will never be another Dimebag and the world is a much s***ier place with out his personality and guitar playing. <br /> <br />Buy this album if you are at all interested in heavy metal
1576751988|5.0|This books could have easily been titled \\"Doing Discipline\\" but I have to admit, I like the title \\"Eat that Frog\\", the metaphor really digs into the well of the procrastinator. <br /> <br />Eat That Frog delivers 21 habits that have been determined invaluable for sucess. Forget the reviewers who feel that these habits could have been condensed, to leave any habit out would be a deterrent to the effectiveness of the program. <br /> <br />This book is a brief easy read but is not intended to be a one time read. Tracy offers bullet points and exercises. They should be repeated on a daily basis. <br /> <br />The concept is that the 21 habits repeated daily can result in behavior change in 21 days. Some behavior \\"experts\\" disagree, however, with advanced techniques like NLP and Alpha programming, it is actually possible to reprogram yourself and establish new habits much quicker. But, like all conditioning, it must be repeated or it can be lost. Just like physical exercise. <br /> <br />I am glad that Brian Tracy is coming out with these smaller books that act like little coaches in book form. The book is compact and can be carried in a mens briefcase or a ladies purse or bag. You can read it over a coffee break or at other opportune times. <br /> <br />Another great one by the great Brian Tracy.
B000BMSTMS|4.0|i couldnt help but write my own review on here after reading, some others on the site. so many of u are callin this album pop, although i agree it's not KoRn's best work, i miss the old KoRn also but i wouldnt call this album pop. for one KoRn has been in the mainstream for a long time now, so does that mean they were pop from the start? i think not. yes this album is a very different sound but listen to say hypocrites or seen it all or last legal drugand i'm sorry but it's not a pop song that you wouldhear everyday on mtv or whatever, the lyrics are still dark and amazing, simply because jon chose to sing and not scream doesent mean we have to start comparing them to britney spears.
1573223085|5.0|A fellow coach recommended this book to me and it was a great recommendation!  As someone who was in an engineering field, but not of it, I began to feel that there was hope for creatures like me.  I understand engineering, but my viewpoint tends to be a big picture viewpoint.  Writing lines of code left half of me wanting something more and my fellow employees and managers irritated.<br /><br />Pink provides a clue as to the types of jobs that will no longer exist in the United States in the coming decades by asking three questions:  Can someone overseas do it cheaper?  Can a computer do it faster?  Is what I'm offering in demand in an age of abundance?<br /><br />As I watched Information Technology (IT) jobs move overseas and become automated, I fully understood what Pink meant with the first question, but the last one had me stumped until I read further.  Then, I grasped that I was already a member of a \\"fleet of empathic, meaning-seeking boomers\\" which had \\"already started wading ashore.\\"  I had self-identified as a Cultural Creative a number of years ago.<br /><br />So if American jobs are significantly going to change, how do we prepare for what Pink calls the Conceptual Age? Even if you are planning to retire from your current job in the near future, the likelihood is that you will continue your work life in some form or another.<br /><br />Daniel Pink describes six areas, or senses, which will need to be enhanced in order to be able to compete in the future job market.  These six are design, story, symphony, empathy, play and meaning.  For each one of these senses, Pink describes how they are being used in the business world right now and how they will be used in the future.  He also discusses how their lack can affect the world around us.  For example, Pink points out that the nonpartisan investigation of the outcome of the Palm Beach County (Florida) election in the 2004 \\"wasn't an evil Supreme Court or recalcitrant chads.  It was bad design.\\" [Italics his.]<br /><br />In each section, provides a portfolio of things you can do to enhance your abilities.  For example, in the story section, Pink suggests that you visit a storytelling festival.  He provides locations, dates and contact information for seven festivals.<br /><br />All in all, the book is an entertaining read and stimulation for thought.  The world is changing and the economy is changing.  As boomers enter the last phases of their official working life, what will they bring to the picture?  Will corporations understand the value that people with experience bring to the job, or will they pursue the \\"cheaper and faster\\" model of exporting to Asia and hiring young college grads (often immigrants) to replace an aging work force?<br /><br />Time will tell if Daniel Pink is right.s his.] <br /> <br />In each section, provides a portfolio of things you can do to enhance your abilities.

B000BVEKO0|1.0|and korn makes it just under the deadline to be voted for Worst album of the year.

B000BP86OG|5.0|I will preface my review by saying I am a true Darkness fan, and saw them live in 2004 here in the US, and really enjoy their music.  I am hard rock person with a fondness for so-called \\"hair\\" metal as well. My favorite Darkness songs are not on either of their 2 albums, though--Bareback, Makin' Out and Physical Sex.<br /><br />This album is like the first in that the more I listen to it, the more I like it.  It isn't the same as the first tho', and here are some reasons why:<br /><br />1.  I didn't really get the comparisons to Queen with the first album, other than the falsetto and cat suits.  This album does bring Queen to mind due to the backing vocals and some guitar arrangements.  I hear some of it and think back to Night at the Opera.  But, that isn't a bad thing, to remind one of Queen, is it?  No, it isn't.<br /><br />2.  There are more pianos and use of other backing instruments in some songs, which again, isn't a bad thing.  It's just different.<br /><br />3.  There are more slow songs on this album.  Again, just a difference, and personally I like more fast, rockin' songs, but these are growing on me (ha!).  And the first 3 songs just truly rock!<br /><br />I think the Darkness are a band you either hate or love--they are not for everyone, so if you don't care for 'em, move along and leave it to us Darklings!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I saw this movie at the theater and I loved it. There is the humor that made the Tv show and more action. The actors have all returned and do a great job. I will be picking this one up on Dec. 20 and you should do the same.
B000A145BE|5.0|When Fay Wray paased away at the age of 96 every single notice of her death mentions the role that made her immortal as the beauty loved by the beast in the 1933 classic \\"King Kong.\\" Wray had been noticed in a few films before that, such as Stroheim's \\"The Wedding March\\" (1928), \\"Thunderbolt\\" (1929), \\"Doctor X\\" (1932), \\"Mystery of the Wax Museum\\" (1933) and \\"The Vampire Bat\\" (1933). Then came her rendezvous with the biggest leading man in history and Fay Wray made her claim to the honor of being the greatest screamer in movie history.<br /><br />Fay Wray is remembered not just because she played opposite King Kong but also because as Ann Darrow she was both sexy and vulnerable. Plus she had the big ape's lung capacity beat six ways to Sunday. Granted, the special effects by Willis O'Brien are enough to make this a classic film, the cinematic forefather of \\"Jaws,\\" \\"Jurassic Park\\" and other celluloid monster movies that involve something other than an actor in makeup. But every time you want to reduce \\"King Kong\\" to pure technical achievement, you hear Fay Wray screaming her head off.<br /><br />The story was pretty much a clich&eacute; the moment it was set down on paper. Movie director Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong) has heard the legend of Kong and hires a ship to find Skull Island. Ann Darrow is starving and destitute, but photogenic and he hires her to be the beauty part of the equation in the film he has planned. Jack Driscoll (Bruce Cabot), the first mate of the tub they are traveling on takes an interest in the young girl's safety, and she responds with guarded affection. Then they get to the island and he discovers that he is indeed involved in a love triangle, but the third party is not Denham, but a giant ape.<br /><br />One thing you have to give directors Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack credit for in this film is that they give Kong a big build up and then they deliver. On the way to the island Denham was making a film test with Ann and had her scream. Then she sees Kong for the first time and takes it to a whole new level. At that point the film becomes a series of action sequences as Kong takes the girl into the jungle, Driscoll leads a rescue party after her only to have Kong follow them back to the native village (the look of terror on Wray's face as she runs for her life through the jungle is equally memorable), which Kong proceeds to destroy before being captured. Then there is the final act of the drama as King Kong, the 8th Wonder of the World is put on display in New York City, only to break free, once again capture Ann, and take her to top of the Empire State Building (whose lights will be dimmed tomorrow night in Wray's honor).<br /><br />I think the T-Rex attack sequence in \\"Jurassic Park\\" is one of the greatest in any monster movie ever made, and I have argued that in addition to the special effects and the masterful cutting of the scene, the sound of the T-Rex is an integral part of what makes the scene work so well. Tonight I am going to make the same argument for Kong's first appearance in \\"King Kong.\\" After all, we are talking about mixing stop motion animation with a giant mechanical head, but such \\"primitive\\" special effects are forgiven because Fay Wray's screams convince you it is really happening. She was not remembered just because she was the girl in \\"King Kong\\" (quick, name the actresses who had the female lead roles in \\"Dracula\\" and \\"Frankenstein\\"). She was remembered because she was an integral part of the film's success (To save you the trouble of looking up the previous trivia point: Helen Chandler and Mae Clarke).<br /><br />This is the \\"original uncut\\" version of the film, but it still does not include the legendary scene when four crewmen who are shaken off the log by Kong fall into a ravine where they are eaten alive by giant spiders. When first previewed the scene stopped the movie cold and Cooper pulled it from the film. The scenes that were cut in the late 1930s and not restored until the 1970s were (a) where Kong pulls Ann's clothes off; (b) the shots of the Apatosaurus (nee Brontosaurus) biting the sailors; (c) Kong eating natives when he breaks through the gate; (d) Kong stepping on a native; (e) Kong biting a New Yorker after escaping from the theater; and (f) Kong grabbing the wrong woman from the hotel and throwing her to her death. It would be nice if they could find the spider sequence or any of the other bits we know were cut by Cooper before the film was released, but it is probably never going to happen and we will just have to make do with Peter Jackson's recreation in his blockbuster remake.  Even so, we will never forget Fay Wary.nd not restored until the 1970s were (a) where Kong pulls Ann's clothes off; (b) the shots of the Apatosaurus (nee Brontosaurus) biting the sailors; (c) Kong eating natives when he breaks through the gate; (d) Kong stepping on a native; (e) Kong biting a New Yorker after escaping from the theater; and (f) Kong grabbing the wrong woman from the hotel and throwing her to her death.

B000BKJ78K|1.0|People should realise by now that all 'full screen' edition DVDs are actually cropped version of the movies. You lost up to 2/3 of the original's composition, so what's the point of filling your square TV screen for the sake of severe cut off & badly composed image? Also, all Star Wars's original trilogy edition after the year 1997 has been altered heavily by George Lucas. The improved version of the film looks nothing but ridiculous. A lot of people might believe in what he said regarding his unhappiness about the original looks, but in my opinion, that's just a lousy excuse of his. It is obvious that he is never satisfied with the looks of the film and will keep changing it again and again, like god knows how many times some pops stars go through countless plastic surgeries because they never satisfied with their appearance. That's a mental problem.
B000000H4V|3.0|<br />  A former girlfiend used to date a guy who was way into Sepultura. Wanting to broaden my music collection, I chose this album to represent their corner of the death metal universe. Sorry, but I don't see what the big deal is. <br /> <br />  Sure Chaos AD is heavy, but it doesn't hold a candle to Meantime by Helmet. The speed is nothing compared to Reign in Blood by Slayer; rythmic diversity? - get a Bad Brains record for more impressive displays. The guitar leads are nothing compared to Dime Bag Darryl's. <br /> <br />  I'm sure seeing Sepultura live was an awesome spectacle (as are most well executed speed metal shows), but on record this stuff is nothing special. Perhaps I'm spoiled by coming of musical age in the golden era of speed-core (Age of Quarrel by the Cro Mags is far superior to this), but even contemporary acts like System Of A Down blow this away. <br /> <br />  Save your money and time - give Toxicity another spin instead.
B000B8QEYC|3.0|I have been long awaiting this new album, and was very happy to see that Enya had come out with a new album, but when I put it on to listen, I was a little bit disappointed in what I heard. As always there is some beautiful tracks. My favorite being track #3, but some of the songs are just dull and sound all alike. As always Nicky Ryan's lyrics are beautiful, but many are very contrived and pop like. The album is missing the warmth that the Celts, or Shepard Moons or even A Day With Out Rain had. It is missing that beautiful dreamy, celtic sound that was once there. In some ways it seems that Enya has sold out to the more mainstream pop market, which disappointments me a bit since I orginally turned to Enya to escape this kind of sound. Instead of buying this album, I would recommend downloading some select songs from itunes and buying The Celts or Shepard Moons instead.
B00076OMW4|5.0|RCA has a vast and incredible library of classical music recordings, particularly in its LIVING STEREO series, and over the years has re-released some of its great titles. One of the more popular and enduring recordings in this series is Fritz Reiner's recording of Dvorak's Ninth Symphony with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. People familiar with the LP version will instantly recognize it distinctive cover with a photograph of the Statue of Liberty, the same monument which would have greeted Dvorak when he first visited the United States and where he was inspired to write this great work.<br /><br />The showpiece of the recording is Dvorak's 9th. Recorded in 1957, the orchestra has a hearty sound. Both Reiner and the orchestra seem familiar with the work. Reiner moves the work along, and is particularly vigorous in his conducting of the fourth movement, which may not be to everyone's liking, but works well with this recording. The CD also contains three other works that are in keeping with Dvorak's 9th. Two are overtures: a robust version of Dvorak's \\"Carnival Overture,\\" and a lively recording of Smetena's overture to \\"The Bartered Bride.\\" The third piece is Weinberger's Polka and Fugue from \\"Schwanda the Bagpiper.\\" Interestingly, while he conducts the Dvorak's pieces with energy, the Weinberger piece is conducted a bit slower than other recordings of the work.<br /><br />One bonus of the re-release of the \\"Living Stereo\\" recordings is that they contain the original liner notes from the LP. Since this CD is a compilation from two different LP's, the liner notes from both are included in this set. RCA has not re-released as many of the titles as they promised ten years ago when they first opened the vaults. Let's hope some of the other great titles will be released in the near future.
B000BMSTMS|5.0|Yep, Korn did it again. With every album they change their sound and yet you always now it's Korn. It's their most experimental album since \\"Follow The Leader\\". And it's purely exhilarating.  <br />There was a mojor loss within the band as guitarist Brian \\"Head\\" Welch decided to leave the band due to personal reasons. Remaining members said that breaking up was never an option and that they tried to turn this loss into an oportunity. An oportunity to \\"reinvent\\" their sound. And they did... they really did. <br />They all stepped up as musicians. Especially Munky who is now the only guitarist in Korn. He produced some wonderful riffs (very popular first single \\"Twisted Transistor\\", \\"Liar\\",  \\"Coming Undone\\", \\"For No One\\"). David presents his skills most clearly on \\"10 Or A 2-Way\\" and on \\"SYOTOS\\" you can hear Fiedly's spectacular bass playing again. If it comes to Jonathan, his vocals have greatly improved over the years. The band produced a lot of catchy songs that just won't get out of your head. The album is heavy and at the same time very melodic. Some of the songs have a very epic feel in them. And I can guarantee that you'll be stunned when you hear \\"Tearjerker\\". <br />The more I listen to this album the more I adore it. My personal favourites are: <br />\\"Liar\\", \\"Love Song\\", \\"Tearjerker\\", \\"Coming Undone\\", \\"Souvenir\\", \\"Open Up\\" and \\"Throw Me Away\\". <br /> <br />I recommend you to get the limited edition that comes with a second CD - it has three really good bonus songs, two remixes of \\"Twisted Transistor\\" (one being extremely great) and two live videos. And the package is the best I've ever seen (with a pop-up art work!).
B000BMSTMS|5.0|Im Going to start this review by Saying I have always been a huge Korn Fan. This album is a lot different than anything they have ever done before. This album is not near as heavy as the Self titled or life is peachy. But for anyone who is a dedicated Korn fan should see that this album is very original and that Korn does not want to make the same album over and over again. And they did this without head which really blew me away. The best songs are Politics, Liar, Getting off and Hypocrite.
B000084T18|3.0|Instrumentally, this is probably the best hip-hop album ever. Dre and em have created some of the greatest beats heard for a long time from the catchy club hit \\"In Da Club\\", right through to the more hard-hitting \\"Dont Push Me\\". However, these great beats dont sheild you from the fact that overall 50 isn't that great a rapper. Don't get me wrong, i'm a massive hip-hop fan. but, for me a great hip-hop album needs quality beats but also a clever lyricicstwho can flow, rhyme and deliver. Unfortunetly, i dont feel that this is 50. When it comes to the club and commercial tracks, 50 can write a catchy chorus, no doubt about that. But, you just don't believe what he is saying in the more darker, emotional tracks. There's no real feeling behind his delivery. In my opinion, the albm was not sold on 50's ability to rap but purely on his image. Hip-hop fans wanted someone with 50's image and they got that leaving other fans a bit cheated out of what was promised to be \\"the future of hip-hop\\". So, what do i think, the future of hip-hop? no a clever marketing ploy by dr.dre and eminem, certainly not the next great lyricist many of us were waiting for.
B0009I7NNA|2.0|I first found Avenged Sevenfold on, of all places, the Madden 2004 soundtrack.  The song was \\"Chapter Four\\" off Waking the Fallen and I was floored.  I picked up the album and fell completely in love with it.  So, needless to say, I was very much looking forward to City of Evil.  Holy hell, was I disappointed. <br /> <br />I will say with all certainty that every song on Waking the Fallen is better than every song on City of Evil.  I have listened to it several times and I can't, for the life of me, understand why now they are suddenly popular.  Maybe I am out of touch with what sells.  This album is mediocre, mostly because we know how much better these guys can go. <br /> <br />Way too many of these songs have that major chord sing-songy Good Charlotte / New Found Glory / Simple Plan bull$#!t feel to them.  The vocals have regressed to the whiny style they had on Sounding the Seventh Trumpet.  I heard that the singer tore something in his throat and can't scream any more.  That's fine.  Get a new f**king singer.  The songs are no longer epic and rocking.  So, I guess if you're a fan of mainstream bubble-gum punk, enjoy.  If you're a metal fan and loved Waking the Fallen, steer clear.  It has its moments (the guitar work is decent in places) and is still somewhat listenable, but it's a huge disappointment.  Slap yourselves, Avenged Sevenfold.
B000002IQW|4.0|Skid row's 2 release ''slave to grind''is thier best album to date. This album is where skid row gets nasty. Over 12 songs skid row redefines themselves as a rock band. Posativly the best post grunge metal recerd. Though it does sag at the end but not that badly.That is the only reason why this album does not get a five,a          great buy.
B00006LLLN|5.0|i had some reservations about buying a cd of a live concert, <br />but after playing the first cd these were largely unfounded. <br />the combination of a live event, excellent musicians and alison's pure crysalline voice gave me more goose-bumps <br />than i can remember having for some time.absolutely first-class.
0307276902|2.0|I \\"bought\\" this book all the way through.  I enjoyed reading it and I thought he had an interesting persepctive on addiction.  But the last page rang so false that I had to reconsider a few things.  I knew that he played loose with the facts.  No heavyweight title fight anything like the one described in this book took place in 1992.  His friend Miles claims to have sentenced several people to death as a federal judge but in reality there were exactly zero federal executions from 1963 to 2001.  But the ending raised my skepticism so far that I had to ask, if he plays loose with the facts, why not just publish this a novel?  The obvious answer is that this book doesn't work as a novel.  It's not horrifying and it's not new or original.  It is little better than the dreadful film \\"Kissing a Fool\\" a corny, shticky David Schwimmer vehicle written by Mr. Frey in 1996.  I believe that he was an addict.  I believe he went to rehab.  I believe these characters are loosely based on people he met there.  I do not believe the hollywood gangster slaying of Mikey Blue Eyes or the hyper-tragic suicide of the Whore With a Heart of Gold on the very day her Knicht in Shining Armor was to be released from prison.  I can't beleive that the world's best rehab center has such poor security.  It just does not add up.   Frey has some good insights and I wish some one would come along and rail against the Monopoly on Recovery that the 12 Steps have in our public conscious.  But he greatly undermines his credibility with this outlandish tale of male fantasy.  This young addict goes to jail and gets a gorgeous girl to fall for him, a gangster to adopt him, a black jazzman to mentor him and a former champion of the world to declare him tough.  And for good measure he MURDERS a man for PUTTING HIS HAND ON THIS THIGH.  To up the emotional ante, he makes this man a Catholic Priest.  In the rectory.  Don't worry James, we know you're not gay.  But we also know you're not murderer and this book isno memoir. Section.
B000BMSTMS|5.0|KoRn's member are pioneers of new sound... These guys have taken it to the next level when you thought they couldn't. They are outspoken and in your face, regardless of being one member down. You wouldn't know it by listening to this CD. Rock on, KoRn.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I'm 40 and my nephew is 27 and he knows a lot about music. So, I wanted to discover a good ''new'' band out there since I'm more in the 70's rock. He told me right of the bat, RADIOHEAD. So there I was buying OK Computer. I will not be able to thank him enough. This is by far the best album I ever owned, and I've owned quite a few. It takes a few good listens, but when you get hooked, that's it!! You will fall in love with this beautifully crafted album that brings you into another state of mind. Few albums, except maybe Dark side of the Moon, can do that. It's simply amazing. Run to the music store and buy it. It will be the best you could do if you're a music fan like I am.
B000268QB2|1.0|Well - if you like this then you surely are someone who knows jack about music. Same old, same old.
B000AV2G3I|5.0|Today marks the 25th anniversary of the shooting of John Lennon. I was never really familiar with his music beyond the mega hits `Imagine' and `Woman' (which I've always loved and always wanted to own) so when this collection came out, I felt it would make for a great introduction.<br /><br />It sure is. With touching lyrics that range from social issues, to his love for his family. I much prefer his delicate ballads which are timeless and beat current stuff hands down. Besides the above mentioned two classics, there's the folk clap-along Vietnam protest number `Give peace a chance', a message still needed today. `God' is a ballad declaring his disbelief in practically everything and everyone besides Yoko and himself. Touching!<br /><br />There is a brilliant acoustic ballad version of `Real love' (released later by The Beatles - Paul, Ringo and George), the tender `Beautiful boy (darling boy)' which I suspect was written for his then young son Sean, `Scared', `#9 dream', `Intuition', and I just love `Happy Christmas (war is over)'.<br /><br />I feel his musical influences can be felt in acts like Oasis to Robbie Williams.<br /><br />As I stated in the title of my review, this was the day the music died, not the songs, mind you (these live forever), but the man.
B000002KIK|2.0|...IN Black Sabbath. At least when I saw Black Sabbath the last three times at Ozzfest. This album is not the last to feature Ozzy as vocalist. There is a two (2) cd release called, oddly enough, \\"Reunion\\" with Ozzy on vocals (get that, not this). <br />For every one who says this was Ozzy's last Sabbath recording, I say whoever sang on \\"Reunion\\" sure sounded like a perfect Ozzy wannabe.
B000BGH22W|3.0|Patrick Doyle is very talented - I own other soundtracks that he has done (Dead Again, Henry V, Much Ado About Nothing) and consider myself a fan.  However, this score just doesn't seem to have the same resonance as those done by John Williams. <br /> <br />It isn't just the CD on its own - I had bought but not listened to the score before I saw the movie, and during the movie realized that none of the music had made an impact on me.  It feels the same when I listen to the CD. It is good music, some of Williams' themes can be heard at times, in other areas the themes are reminiscent of Doyle's other work.  But I've listened to it about five times through, and now I'm going to listen to \\"Azkaban.\\"
B00000DMJF|1.0|As a reviewer wrote on January 12, 2000, why not the MONO mix for this \\"special\\" re-release?<br /><br />The music is 5 stars, but 1 star for the uninspired release.
B0000C8AVM|5.0|This does not have a bad song on it.  It is a work of art!  Something I have come to expect from Bob with each album down thru the years. <br /> <br />It is minimum five stars...the best of the best.
0060899190|5.0|I agree that there are some layout problems, but they do not overshadow the overall message and impact that this book has.  If I had the money, I'd buy this book for everyone I know.
B00000DLV1|5.0|This has to be one of the best live CDs I've ever had the pleasure of owning.  Typically I wouldn't recommend a live CD to a new fan, but this is different.  I listen to this disc much more than the studio albums.  Something about working with a live orchestra brings out the nuances and subtleties of the music.  The DVD is exceptional too and contains additional songs and some different versions of the songs on the CD.   <br />This is one of my favorite albums of the last couple of years. <br />-James
B000002UB6|4.0|By far the Beatles' least popular album. I, however, consider it among their best. It beats the White Album, that's for sure!<br /><br />Why so many people positively hate this album is beyond me. I actually put it fourth on my Beatle favorite list (Behind Abbey Road, Revolver and Sgt. Pepper). Most Beatles fans (me included) speak of classics Get Back and Let It Be, the song that is, in hushed, reverent tones. And there's plenty of buried treasure here, like John's nonsensical Dig a Pony, George's religous commentary song I Me Mine (which beats the version on LIB Naked), I've Got a Feeling, and One After 909, actually among one of the first songs the group recorded. How it stayed in the vaults so long is beyond me, it would've fit well on A Hard Day's Night. Then there's Lennon's dreamy Across the Universe. And let's not forget the brilliant throwaway Dig It, which really puts a smile on your face!<br /><br />However, there are stinkers. More specifically, Maggie Mae...why this stupid Liverpool ditty was recorded is beyond me. Sure, it would've been perfect on an Anthology or one of Lennon's solo albums, and it does fit in fairly nicely on an album like this, but it's just not all that good. Then theres one of the more popular tunes: the Long and Winding Road. Spector had done a good production job with I Me Mine and Across the Universe (And a good job in general), but why was Road recorded with all those strings and that choir? It sucks the life out of the song, especially compared to how efficiantly the orchestra is used on the aforementioned tracks.<br /><br />So give it a second listen, you just might like it!
B000002GLV|5.0|You can't go wrong when you put this album on when it's time to party; it is impossible to listen to this and not tap, dance or otherwise get movin'. \\"Country Road\\" and \\"Dry throat\\" contain some of the best jazz/blues you'll ever hear. All the cuts on the album rock. \\"Mess around\\" is another great cut. There is one slightly tedious cut which features everyone and lets face it, bass and drum soloes can become a bit \\"longer than they are\\". But it is a live performance and that's usually part of a live show; but, for me, that is only a small glitch in this album; it is still one of my favorite Mayall works. Whatever happened to Freddy Robinson? Great guitarist. The horns on this album are also great. Mayall does some of his best harp work too. Having been a musician in an earlier life, I remember times when during a jam or performance that the music is so tight and everyone is so locked in that the volume increases slightly, the energy goes up and the precision is just unbelieveable...you can hear many such moments like that during this performance--and the audience's response is right there. You won't find a live album engineered and performed much better than this...these guys are all great musicians and they had excellent sets those nights. This album just flat out cooks...
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|Opening my christmass present in 2000 totally changed my gaming preference. I can remember seeing \\"Final Fantasy 7\\" boldly across the 3 disc set. Finishing the game in 56:34 one month later left me with a strong memory of the plot and characters, which many great Rpg's do. Nearly five years later on my computer screen, reading the english subtitles while witnessing Advent Children was very much a \\"reunion\\" of these younger gaming days. The CG graphics stuffed my eyes full, making them wide and open, not blinking to not miss any of the carnage fighting or the beautiful storyline. Agreeing with Terry Mesnard, the scenes bring back many memories, which is the main attraction I was most absorbed in, with the storyline also as a major freature, the addition of the graphics and encounters were the finishing touches and polishing of the movie.=) <br /> <br />\\"To those who loved this world <br />And have spent their time together with <br />their companions in this world in the past: <br />Reunite once again to endure this time\\" <br />-At begin of movie <br /> <br />I believe this is the True \\"Reunion\\" for the many of those players who witnessed Aeris' death, mixup with Cloud's  <br />conscience and Zack, Tifa's @$$ kicking, Barret and Cid's cursing, Red XIII and Cat Sith's wierd forms, Yuffie's side story, Vincent's silence, the Executives of Shin-ra, and Sephiroth's wrath. <br />( Am I forgetting any?:\ ) <br />For those of you who remembered FF7 as I did, this is a very nice addition to the original game/story. <br /> <br />I apologize if I am shutting out those who have not played the original, which is in a way strange, but it is my assumption that the movie directed toward diehard fans of this game and series.

B000C1YL1G|5.0|If you're an Eminem fan you have all of these songs already-- but the CD is worth buying simply for the single \\"When I'm Gone\\" alone.  Eminem is known for riding the thin line between telling stories and telling HIS story, and he is never more introspective than in \\"When I'm Gone.\\"  Personally, I wish this CD consisted of more of those songs-- of the songs Eminem says he likes but not many else do (like \\"Rock Bottom\\" which never made it to a single).   Instead he delivers an even mix of those (\\"Mockingbird,\\" \\"Lose Yourself,\\" \\"Like Toy Soldiers,\\" \\"Cleanin Out My Closet,\\" and \\"Way I Am\\") with his commercial \\"dance\\" hits like \\"My Name Is,\\" \\"Real Slim Shady,\\" \\"Without Me,\\" and \\"Just Lose It.\\"   \\"Shake That\\" is one of the new songs that falls into that category, as is \\"Fack\\"...sort of...\\"Fack\\" is more like \\"Drips\\" than anything else, and I wonder what the clean  version of the CD will have to compensate.  Anyway, this dual disc version is the CD to get because Stan's Mixtape includes \\"Renagade--\\" the Eminem/Jay-Z song previously released only on Jay's \\"The Black Album.\\"  While all of the songs on Stan's Mixtape can be easily found on any downloading system on the net, it's just nice to have the tracklist all together.  \\"Curtain Call\\" also includes the live Elton John performance of \\"Stan\\" as a Bonus Track, in addition to Dido's version so you can compare the two.  Unfortunately, the live version is taken straight from the CBS telecast of the Grammys, and though the cheering and live audience has been removed from the track, it is still the \\"broadcast suitable\\" version and therefore bleeped.  Eminem is a powerhous in hiphop, and \\"Curtain Call\\" is yet another chart topper for him.  Hopefully he'll be back in the near future with new fresh tracks that sound a lot like \\"When I'm Gone\\" because that is definitely the stand-out of this CD, if not of his career in general.
B000BO0LLS|1.0|Mariah's music is full of contrived cliche lyrics, sung over tried and tired beats, immaculately polished to fit the radio airwaves. Forget substance, edge or any sense of diversity, Mariah is in it for the hits, and if it means selling her soul, then so be it. <br /> <br />You see, the difference between Madonna and Mariah is quite simple:  <br /> <br />Madonna is a pioneer of our times, an artist who goes against the grain, and challenges social norms. Her power and passion far transcends only her music, as she is a cultural icon. her music may not always sell in the tens of millions, but it makes a statement, and with time, it is appreciated for the risks it took. <br /> <br />mariah is a pioneer(purchaser) of hit songs.
B0002S94BG|5.0|\\"...it's such an eclectic album too... he had such a short recording career its great that there is that album that shows so many different sides of him musically...\\" ~Tighe<br /><br />There are two CDs in this collection, the first is a supposedly re-mastered edition of Buckley's first CD release, Grace. I honestly cannot tell a difference between the original and this one; they are both rather quiet compared to other CDs I own. The cover art and a lot of the inside of the CD consist of photos used in the original Grace, but this CD includes a larger booklet with more photos and written commentary on disk two by Steve Berkowitz of Columbia and Buckley's mother Mary Guibert.<br /><br />The second CD included in Grace (Legacy Edition) is a gathering of several unreleased and rare Jeff Buckley tracks. The first song is the most controversial of Buckley's career. Forget Her was the song that he never wanted to see released due to its incredibly personal nature. Guibert, had to make a difficult decision. Should she release it and satisfy the want from fans who had somehow found a less than perfect copy and sent it over the internet or should she keep it to herself and fulfill her son's wishes? Obviously, she released it, sparking mixed feelings with Buckley's fans. Did she do it for the money or did she truly think Jeff would have been okay with it? Either way, it is now officially released and what an incredible song it is! Forget Her is a haunting, gorgeous, conflicted song filled with passion and Buckley's remarkable vocals. I avoid listening to it too much both to respect Buckley's request and so as not to wear it out. It is one of those songs that is so addicting, it is hard to turn away. There are also alternate versions of songs released on other albums like Dream Brother, Kangaroo, Eternal Life, and Kick Out the Jams. Some of the other songs are less accessible than these. Lost Highway is a cover of a country song, Alligator Wine has Jeff imitating a very strange style of singing, and I Want Someone Badly is sort of a soul/gospel type song. The most outstanding songs on this album aside from Forget Her are the covers of Bob Dylan's Mama, You Been on my Mind and Nina Simone's The Other Woman. They're downplayed but emotional and poetic complimented brilliantly by Buckley's incredible voice.<br /><br />There is also a DVD included in the package. This DVD includes the Electronic Press Kit included on the Live in Chicago DVD with extra scenes edited in to make it much longer, music videos, and a discography of Jeff's vastly expanded collection since his death in 1997.<br /><br />The new EPK is incredible. It doesn't matter how many times you've watched the first one, this one is highly watchable and different enough that the old one does not become obsolete (that is, if you're a Buckley fanatic like I am). First off, there are several new Buckley quotes to laugh about, to think about, to obsess over wishing desperately Buckley were still alive making music and delighting us with his wisdom. Secondly, there are interviews both from the past and the present with people close to Jeff including Steve Berkowitz of Columbia Records; Matt Johnson, Buckley's drummer; Mick Grondahl, the bass player; Andy Wallace, the producer; and Michael Tighe, guitarist. These interviews explain the process of making Grace very well and help give insight into the mechanics of the album. Last, there are home videos of Jeff in the studio, out with friends, and at shows.<br /><br />The music videos leave something to be desired. Buckley was not a fan of videos to illustrate the music; he did not want to get fans due to the way he looked or anything funny in a music video of his. Therefore, the Grace video is a red tinted black and white series of clips from an in-studio performance of the song filled with artistic close-ups of Jeff and random objects like cats and clocks. Last Goodbye is basically a video of the band in front of a screen featuring images of various scenes from nature like flowers, the moon, and water. So Real is the most like a traditional music video and is perhaps the most entertaining, although it is also quite strange. It features Buckley on a bicycle riding through a town. He stops at a diner where the rest of the band is working, eating, and filming. This is when things get weird. Men dressed in monkey suits are outside stealing Buckley's bike; when the distorted guitars come in, there is a trippy party shot out of focus. At the end, Buckley runs down the street, discarding clothes as he goes. The Eternal Life video is not really a video. It is an amalgamation of images from the Live in Chicago DVD. The song isn't the album version either; it is live. The Forget Her video is a combination of psychedelic shots, home videos, and footage of Buckley inside of a car. All of the Jeff footage makes the video appear to be a tribute although the song is not appropriate for this kind of homage at all.<br /><br />The discography is in order from the date of release. They include a track list and are set on a background of photos.<br /><br />This latest addition to the Buckley collection leaves fans wanting more, but the scary thought can't help but arise: how much more is there to release and when will we run out of proof of Jeff's amazing talent?of various scenes from nature like flowers, the moon, and water.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|The bass, the beats, the sonic shapes buzzing about this modern masterpiece travel through your body like bolts of energy, and before you know it, you have been taken into another world. Little albums can transport me to another place, but when listening to this record, i felt a sudden urge to abandon and forget all my bills, loans and administration, and just dance the night away. <br /> <br />If I had to describe the feeling you get when experiencing this album, it would be: PURE SONIC BLISS. Words, reviews and talk is inadequate in describing the brilliance of this album, and only a listen can truly reveal the wonders which lie within the casing of this disc. <br /> <br />Don't think or ponder, if you haven't purchased this album yet, then you are missing out on one of the best albums of the last decade.

She offends the memory of jesus, our savior, who died for her sins, just so she can get some implants and wear a short dress. jesus would be appalled at the message spread by this so called 'christmas' album. Her musical whoring is unacceptable, and good christians should avoid this album at all costs.

0380715430|4.0|In The Mother Tongue: English & How It Got That Way, Bill Bryson tries to solve the mysteries of the English language. He explains why the spelling and pronunciation of certain words don't match and why certain American words are different from their British counterpart. Bryson gives his readers a history lesson about English, complete with lessons about the different English dictionaries, a journey through England after the French left, and the propriety of Victorian England.  <br />He writes about topics other than English's history, including its present dominance and its uncertain future. These topics serve to create a fuller picture of a language that Bryson claims has become \\"the lingua franca\\" of various areas of everyday life. <br />Throughout the book, Bryson entertains his reader with wit and humor. Bryson's jokes make reading the book a smooth process because their accurately demonstrate his topics. When writing about the difference between American words and English words he gives the example of the word \\"fanny\\" which has an innocent meaning in America, but a rather vulgar one in England. <br />The Mother Tongue is clearly entertaining, but Bryson also informs his readers well. He has covered the various topics of language thoroughly. Bryson is well versed on the topic. He draws on the writing of many worthy predecessors, including William Safire and H.L. Mencken. Readers will find Bryson's book to be educational and enlightening.  <br />

B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|I have occasionally listened to Nightwish all through their career, but apart from \\"Walking in the Air\\" cover -- which I liked for purely nostalgic reasons -- their music never really appealed to me. Not even Oceanborn, in my opinion their best record until Once, was much better than mediocre. The songs were not heavy enough (too much of 80's styled keyboards and guitar solos), nor were the symphonic elements majestic enough. <br /> <br />With Once, Nightwish finally got all the blocks in the right places. The material is extremely solid, production is perfect, and the presentation is flawless -- even the male vocals, which were embarrassingly bad on Oceanborn, are now top class, thanks to Marco Hietala. <br /> <br />To me, this is their finest effort by far. Too bad the line-up behind this apex decided to split. Hopefully there will be new material from Nightwish in the future nonetheless, and hopefully it will be at par with this album.
1400031087|1.0|Very few drug addicts or alcoholics can achieve and maintain any long term sobriety without help and support and friendship found in a 12 step program like AA or NA.  Although this book is riveting and an interesting read, it sends out a very dangerous message to people with the disease of addiction.  I know this because I am a recovering alcoholic.  Will power and sheer determination was NOT enough to keep me sober.  I and many many others out there need the friendship, unconditional love and total understanding that we find at the tables of 12 step meetings to be able to maintain our sobriety and learn to live life on lifes terms without picking up a drink or a drug.<br /><br />This is the story of 1 man with a relatively short amount of sobriety... Keep that in mind while you are reading this book...
B00008H2LB|5.0|Wow, I was waiting for this album since I bought Hybrid Theory, this one is about as good as the other one. The combination of DJ, Metal and Rap is really shining here, let's take a closer look at the album:<br /><br />Foreword: (-/-) The intro of the next song.<br /><br />Don't Stay: (9/10) Very nice Metal song, really rocks.<br /><br />Somewhere I Belong: (10/10) Their first single from Meteora, very good<br /><br />Lying From You: (8/10) very good heavy song, begins with a nice DJ intro<br /><br />Hit The Floor: (8/10)the singer really shouts here.<br /><br />Easier To Run: (8/10)this is a more relaxing song, the ballad of the album<br /><br />Faint: (10/10) The fast Raprocker, very swinging, very good<br /><br />Figure 09: (10/10) Superb, just can't find another word for it<br /><br />Breaking The Habit: (9/10) The poppish song, and a single release<br /><br />From The Inside: (8/10) Nice<br /><br />Nobody's Listening: (8/10) A rap song, with a small piece of metal, nice rapping<br /><br />Session: (7/10) A DJ solo<br /><br />Numb: (10/10) A superb ending song, perfect melody<br /><br />So we seem to have a five star album here. But I wonder how long it'll take until the vocalist loses his voice. He really shouts very loud. I recommend it to everyone who liked Hybid Theory.<br /><br />KEEP ON ROCKING!!!
B000B5UL7G|1.0|Robbie Williams was a promising talent when he first emerged as a solo performer, but this collection of bland, cookie-cutter sappy ballads is indicative of the self-indulgent posturing that has capsized many a musical career. Every song sounds the same and not one has a hit-worthy hook. I see that I'm in the minority here, but it's rather unfortunate that the current state of music is such that this slab of disappointment is lauded as being some kind of masterpiece. Something has to change.
B000002MP2|1.0|Is this music? I call it loud noise! This stuff really stinks, none of the numbers is longer than 3,5 minutes, and how can you like it when all the songs are the same. Only Basket Case is nice, and it deserves a 9/10. But the rest, all 1/10. Just worthless, spare your money, and go buy something else. What also bothers me is the fact that there are no guitar solo's and cool guitar rifs. Just the same speed, same style, same everything. And the singer sings like he's got a running nose. And the guitar does the same tune every 3 seconds. I just don't understand how this can be a 4.5 star-album.<br />Keep On Rocking
0345298349|4.0|Martin Cruz Smith's \\"Gorky Park\\" is a literary thriller, and is more notable for Smith's unique style and his gift for capturing the bizarre Soviet world than it is its conventional plot and resolution. <br /> <br />\\"Gorky Park\\" is ostensibly a police procedural, where maverick investigator Arkady Renko is the \\"one good cop\\" in a corrupt justice system investigating the murders of three young people in Moscow.  Of course, this being a thriller, Renko's investigation takes him high up the food chain, where he gets a chance to expose high corruption, nefarious deeds by officials, and the hypocrisy of the world he lives in.  And, of course, he falls in love with a gorgeous woman along the way. <br /> <br />Two things set \\"Gorky Park\\" apart from conventional thrillers you see in every airport bookstore.  The first has to be Smith's command of daily life in the Soviet Union.  Published in 1981 before the collapse of the Soviet Union, \\"Gorky Park\\" sweeps along with the rhythm of daily life under communism, and it's a disjointing, jarring rhythm indeed.  Smith combines an eye for detail with what must have been eye-numbing research to transport the reader to another world that is completely alien to Americans.  The novel starts out in Moscow and ends in New York, and it's interesting that Smith is so able to capture the jarring differences between the two cities. <br /> <br />Smith's style also elevates \\"Gorky Park.\\"  Too many thrillers use language in purely functional terms, and dialogue is invariably direct and serves the purpose of clearly advancing plot or building character.  In \\"Gorky Park,\\" Smith is much more subtle than your average author.  Many passages and lines require re-reading to figure out what is actually being said -- not that Smith writes badly, it's just that most of \\"Gorky Park\\" is heavily laden with subtext, and Smith also has the patience to let \\"Gorky Park\\" unfold gradually.  While this may slow the novel down somewhat, it also makes the story deeper and richer. <br /> <br />\\"Gorky Park\\" is not a pleasant novel, or a \\"fun read.\\"  Arkady Renko is not one of those cops who throws off pitch-perfect quips, and he is not a physical juggernaut prone to kicking butt and taking names.  Rather, he is the perfect investigator for the Soviet system - dogged, intelligent, and deeply cynical.  It's that cynicism that lets Renko see his fellow Soviets for who they are, and this insight makes him a great detective. <br /> <br />I admire \\"Gorky Park\\" more than I like it, which is why I give the novel only four stars.  Renko, it must be said, is a bit of a downer.  The novel opens with the dissolution of Renko's marriage, and Renko spends most of the novel in a morose funk (and not necessarily due to the divorce).  Renko is a man who has been almost entirely crushed by the Soviet system and also by his family, and all that is left in his is a spark of his former self.  It is that spark, that undying, implacable fire inside Renko that makes him such a compelling character.  Dour, fatalistic, cyncial, pessimistic, to be sure, but very compelling. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0316776963|3.0|The hype has been huge for this book and all I have been hearing lately is how wonderfully funny Sedaris's book is. One or two people even told me it was better than Augusten Burroughs' stuff. This of course, got me very interested and I hurried out to buy the book.<br /><br />As much as I was desperate to love it, I was unfortunately disappointed. Don't get me wrong. There are some funny stories, and there is no doubt that Sedaris is witty and comically twisted, but he doesn't hold a candle to Burroughs...not even close. In honesty, I am not sure why so many people compare the two.<br /><br />The truth is, Sedaris is just a little too mild for me. I would never dissuade anyone from reading his material, I would simply say that for those who like dark and twisted humor, Augusten Burroughs is your man. Sedaris is the appetizer.
B000068TPN|5.0|This movie, we were soldiers is a great epic, especially for those who love war, with great vividness and scenery, and above all, a great story. This movie does get very violent, and graphic, and the violence is sustained; and that's what it's rating is for. The language is brief, so there is nothing to worry about there. But it is a very good story, and I recommend this movie to war lovers and people who are in the mood for historical action.
B000BVD460|3.0|I've been a fan of Eminem since he came out. The slim shady lp, and the marshall mathers lp are two of the greatest cds not just in rap, but in general. But he started losing steam with the eminem show (which was still a good cd) and then he realeased encore which made me think that maybe his reign at the top of rap is over. After encore, he went on the anger management tour, which he left before it was over to enter rehab. Rumors of retirement then came up, but he denied them, and then he released curtain call, a pretty basic collection of his hits.  <br /> <br /> First off, two of the new songs on here suck. Fack is em trying to go back to his slim shady days, which have never been the same since the slim shady lp. And i have no idea why Shake That is on here. I guess it's a club song, but i don't think most clubs play eminem to begin with, and this song proves why. When I'm Gone is a damn good song. Its way better then Mockingbird, and defiantly proves its place on em's greatest hits. As for the greatest hits, the usual suspects of My Name Is, Real Slim Shady, Without Me, Just Lose It, and Lose Yourself are here. (I honestly hate Just Lose It, but it was on radio for a long time, so i guess it should be on here.) The Way I Am, Stan, Like Toy Soldiers, Cleaning out my Closet, and Guilty Conscience also earn there place here, but i honestly think that Sing for the Moment, Mockingbird, and Just Lose It shouldn't be on here. And Stan Live w/Elton John is alright, but probably should have been put on that bonus disc for the 2 disc version. Songs that should have been on here are Role Model (My Fav, which i guess is on the bonus disc of the 2 disc), 97 Bonnie and Clyde, Marshall Mathers, and Superman (I thought that'd be on here for sure). If you want to include feats, I'd defiantly say Forgot about Dre (Dre, 2001), Purple Pills (D12), Patiently Waiting (50 Cent) and My Band (D12, Catchy Song.)  <br />  <br /> So there it is. Overall, if your new to Em, yeah, buy it,but most people including me probably have all of his cd's anyways. I just hope Em doesn't go on on Encore, i still think he's got one left in him. I'm Out. <br /> <br />
B000001TVD|5.0|In my record collection, this will NEVER die. All to iPod. Walking the streets of Los Angeles is NOT the same as before owning this. There's a lot more thunder out there. <br />This is one of those unique albums where awkward sound quality actually ENHANCES the experience! The drum and guitar basses both thud *and* croak in a manner that tempts you turn yer speakers to Apocalypse Overdrive just to see what explodes - particularly on \\"You and Your Folks\\" and \\"Super Stupid.\\" <br />In spite of the \\"George-Clinton-finds-dead-brother's-skull\\" legend, the title track, to me, conjures only one thing: Vietnam War. Eddie Hazel is indeed \\"playing guitar like his mother died,\\" with that aggrieved wail, the clever, delicate echo of the echo effect, and whatever else he could stick in ten minutes.  <br />Y'know, call me corporate, but I think \\"Can You Get to That\\" would make a wonderful 'romance' track for a unique sort of film. <br /> <br />Parliament-Funkadelic had enough staying power and rapid-fire lineup changes to have many short, distinct eras - if you were to delve in and listen to all their albums, one after the other in release order, you'd recognize them. This is the last early 1970's P-Funk bomb before their trip towards professional musical presentation that culminated in \\"One Nation.\\"  <br />If purchased, this album must be played and sung OUT LOUD throughout the house.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|After numerous hints here that Funeral was \\"recommended\\" for me and a few articles in the music press singing the praises of Arcade Fire, I finally caved in and bought it. <br />At first, I was ambivalent about it because on first listen it seemed a little poppy for my taste. But after repeated listens, it grew on me. All I can think now is about why I waited so long to buy it! <br />Funeral still seems poppy, but in a positive, non-commercial sense. And it is so irrepressibly musically upbeat that you can't help but like it. My favorites are Neighborhood 1(Tunnels), Neighborhood 2 (Laika), Crown of Love, and Wake Up!. What grabs me most is the stirring vocal intensity. <br />If you haven't yet heard The Arcade Fire, and are looking for something new, you are in for a treat with Funeral. UNCUT has named it album of the year and I can't disagree.
B00000AFGM|5.0|I have never liked Marilyn Manson. I have always been a fan of heavy metal, hard rock, whatever, but I just never could get in to the guy's music. Somewhere along the way, I heard this described as almost \\"glam\\" in the good New York Dolls, T. Rex kind of way, so I gave it a shot. I wasn't disapointed. In fact, I saw sides of Manson I never expected to see and now consider this to be one of my favorite modern metal albums. The reason is simple. This isn't big dumb heavy metal about Satan. It's big intelligent rock about life. Granted some of it is a life we don't all see, but the album is amazing. Speed of Pain,and Fundementally Loathsome are gorgeous, and the rest of it rocks just as much as you could want.
B0002S947K|3.0|I first noticed this CD at the listening bar in a major West Coast music chain. A friend who was with me listened a bit and bought it. A month later, I was in the same store again and noticed that Trouble was still a featured item at a very special price. So having read in the interim a slew of positive articles on it and accepting my friend's recommendation, I finally bought it.  Well, I haven't jumped on the Ray LaMontagne bandwagon just yet though I see by the glowing reviews that many have. Some hear a little Van Morrison here. I don't hear any Van Morrison at all, but I do find LaMontagne's voice to have a large dose of Joe Cocker with a few dashes of Steve Winwood, Paul Weller and B W Stevenson in the mix. A couple of the songs (Shelter and Hannah) even had me thinking of Neil Young and The Band! Of course, if you are unfamiliar with these other artists you won't notice any similarities, but you should see the comparisons as a good thing.  My favorite cut is the anti-war anthem How Come. Other than that, while La Montagne shows promise, overall the album just doesn't yet speak to me. I will certainly listen on occasion, but I will wait until I hear more on a future recording before I decide whether he merits a place in my musical pantheon.

B000059S9D|5.0|My awareness of Porcupine Tree dates only from the issue of their masterpiece In Absentia CD. Both it and two subsequent albums were so good that I knew I had to work my way back through PTs older CDs to get the full flavor of what the band is capable of. One thing I have noticed is that so far each PT CD I have heard stands on its own with scant reference to what the band had done previously. I like that, it shows that the band's foundations rest on a bedrock of massive talent. <br />I bought Lightbulb Sun from this site before the surge of PT reissues that made available some recordings that had been long out of print. When I put it on, I was dazzled by the quality of the music. Some reviewers liken Porcupine Tree to Pink Floyd. Well, yes, there are some superficial similarities but PT is not a Pink Floyd copy. Steve Wilson is far too much of a talent to allow that to happen. <br />The best cuts on Disc 1 are the hard-driving title cut, the CSNY- evoking How Is Your Life Today, Four Chords That Made A Million, the spacey prog workout on Last Chance to Evacuate..., the rocking Hatesong, and the Floydian Russia On Ice. But my favorite is Shesmovedon. On disc 2, I am partial to the harmonic Pure Narcotic and the progressive Tinto Brass. <br />Lightbulb Sun is another absolutely essential CD from Porcupine Tree. Whether or not you realize it, your CD collection has a gaping hole in it if you don't have this. I couldn't wait for the reissue and am very happy with the limited edition available here. Its been worth every cent. Indulge yourself now, you won't be sorry!
1594200653|4.0|This is, in many respects, an outstanding book.  Judt accomplishes the daunting job of providing a solid narrative overview of European history (excluding Russia/Soviet Union)from the end of WWII to the present.  Accompanying the narrative is a great deal of astute analysis, both of major trends and of specific episodes.  The book is divided into 4 major periods; the immediate post-war era of reconstruction and the onset of the Cold War, the great boom of the 50s and 60s with its major demographic, social, and economic changes, the recessional period of the 70s and 80s, and the most recent period after the fall of the Soviet Union.  The major theme is a multi-generational effort to build a Europe that avoids the mistakes that led to the catastrophes of the WWI-WWII period.  Judt provides a guardedly positive view of European success.  The factors that led to the catastrophe of the first half of the 20th century were strong nationalism and what might be called neo-mercantilism, authoritarian/totalitarian states, powerful ideologies (particularly Marxism), and great internal social discord.  Judt sees modern Europe, with democratic and pacific states, its emphasis on economic integration, and social welfare systems aimed at guaranteeing a minimum amount of social amity, as largely escaping the problems that led to WWI and WWII.<br /><br />Judt deals very well with the major events (and often their social consequences) that propelled Europe along this pathway.  The crucial role of the US, and in an ironic way, of the Soviet Union, helped to rescue Western Europe from post-WWII devastation and provided an international framework that demanded western european cooperation.  This included a great deal of intelligent decision making by Western European leaders, requiring for example, that the French accept a revitalized and eventually rearmed Germany, that the Germans ultimately accept the post-WWII borders.  He devotes equal time also to the fate of Eastern Europe, which stands in some ways as a distorted mirror of the Western European experience.  The later convergence of Eastern and Western European history after the fall of the Soviet Union is described particularly, both with its positive and many negative aspects.  While this political story is the armature of the book, Judt does an excellent job of outlining the relevant social history.  Nor is this book schematic, while this is an overview, we get enough relevant history of individual nations to be more than satisfactory.<br /><br />Judt is an excellent writer and his analyses are often telling.  Read, for example, his discussion of why so many major European leaders of the 50s were elderly men or his evenhanded analysis of Margaret Thatcher's tenure as Prime Minister of Britain.<br /><br />As good as this book is, there are blemishes and some of them are significant.  Judt's breadth and depth of knowledge are really impressive but I detected a number of factual errors.  I am skeptical that the Chernobyl accident caused 30,000 deaths and that the partition of India caused \\"millions\\" of the deaths (the usual estimate is 1 million).  Judt is wrong to imply that defeat at Dien Bien Phu brought France to the bargaining table at Geneva.  There are also a number of significant omissions.  Given the importance of the demographic and economic history covered by Judt, it would have been useful to include a small number of summary charts on these topics.  Judt covers some intellectual history, especially as related to social history, but he makes a major (and all too common) error by not including any discussion of changes in the natural sciences.  For example, he states that in the 50s, Paris was established (partly by default) as the intellectual capital of Europe.  In a sense he is correct but the 50s and 60s were a golden age for British science and no country in Europe matched the productivity of British scientists.  Who is the more consequential figure, Jean-Paul Sartre or the Briton Francis Crick, co-discoverer of DNA structure (among several important contributions to biology)?  Cambridge, London, and Oxford were intellectual capital in a way Paris could never match.<br /><br />A final and real sin of omission is the lack of appropriate footnotes and a bibliography.  The absence of the latter significantly reduces the utility of this admirable book for Judt's fellow scholars, for students, and for the general reading public.  Both Judt and his publisher should make an effort to rectify this flaw.cis Crick, co-discoverer of DNA structure (among several important contributions to biology)?

B00000K3CM|4.0|I like this film better then the first home alone in maney ways. I cant understand why home alone was a hugh hit it was good but not great. I found this one more funnier then the original but why more unbelievable. Ok let me start with the unbelievable part 1. He gets on a plane without his parents and saying he has his ticket 2. He meets the wet or now called the stickey bandits out of all new york city 3. The traps ok you would probobly die from some of the stuff he dose. After saying all those points I have to say it's a movie and a slap stick movie so it's supose to be fake. I found the traps way more funnier in this one and the bandits are funnier in this one.

B000B7BRMM|3.0|First things first: Diana K's voice is what is featured here; her piano playing is practically non-existent.  Instead, she is backed by the Clayton/Hamilton Jazz Orchestra.  Longtime fans of Krall will recognize those two names as probably her favorite sidemen (John Clayton, bass, and Jeff Hamilton, drums).  Her other sideman fixture, guitarist Anthony Wilson, is also in the band. <br /> <br />The spotlight, however, is focused on Krall's voice -- the band definitely plays backup.  The \\"C/H Jazz Orch\\" is a great band, and can (and sometimes does) really swing, but on this CD, they aren't given much of a chance.  The majority of the songs are Krall's trademark \\"sultry slow ballads\\", with a few fun exceptions.  The biggest surprise is the inclusion of \\"Christmas Time is Here\\", which will make most listeners think of the Charlie Brown Christmas cartoon -- only here, it gets a proper grown-up rendition instead of the children's choir used in the show.  That tune alone is almost worth the price of the CD. <br /> <br />I am a *huge* fan of Krall, but this CD just doesn't do it for me.  I think the main reason is that her piano playing adds so much to her performances, and when it's missing, it leaves a big hole.  Also, since she's singing for virtually the whole 44 minutes (including a touch of scat), the record has a \\"sameness\\" that doesn't happen in the rest of her recordings, where she, of course, not only takes several solo choruses on the piano, but is very liberal in handing out solos to her sidemen (esp. Wilson). <br /> <br />If you're looking for Diana singing all the Christmas standards with a lush big band (violins and all), then this will hit the spot.  But as Krall would attest, she is first and foremost a jazz pianist, and her singing career was tacked on well after she was the \\"teenage jazz piano phenom\\".  I personally think the record would have come off better in her typical milieu -- her at the piano, her three favorite sidemen, and a smattering of purelyinstrumental choruses of theses Christmas standards. <br /> <br />And if you're just a plain old Kralloholic, it's a must.  Although I must say I am completely baffled by the cover art -- it looks like the photographer told her to gather up that voluminous dress to show off her (still great) legs, and then \\"lean back so that it looks like you're in pain and will fall off the chair any moment\\".

Revenge is just a cleaner suicide...like the difference between a person who slits their wrists, and a lethal injection.  One is just a lil cleaner but it gets the job done.     oh yeah. For all you reviewers sayin MCR is emo: they are not emo! Emo bands get dumped by their girl and whine, beg to get her back,\\"Oh, You hurt my feelings!\\". Lol!

Look Closely: That's the costume that MacGregor wore for Episode III. One was fitted for Hayden and Hayden was filmed. Then the original actor for the ending was erased, and Hayden inserted. <br /> <br />If you want a good Special Edition, listen to the Radio versions or read the Radio scriptbooks. :thumbsup:
B0008F113W|5.0|With all the Roadrunner Record's 25th Anniversary Re-issues coming out right now, my head is almost spinning trying to pick them all up. To no surprise though, Fear Factory's 1995 masterpiece \\"Demanufacture\\" is one of those influential re-releases along with Killswitch Engage's \\"Alive Or Just Breathing\\", Sepultura's \\"Roots\\", and many others. \\"Demanufacture\\" is no question Fear Factory's finest hour. The epic structure of the songs, the brutal sound of the music, Burton's trademark cut throat vocals, they all come into perfection with this release. When this album debuted almost 10 years ago, it changed the face of modern metal. That influence still continues to live on today, and can easily be seen in the new wave of american heavy metal, which has taken a lot of Fear Factory-esque elements and put them to use. The 2cd re-issue is definitely a must for fans, even if you own the original digipak. You won't even believe how relevant this record still remains today. <br /> <br />\\"Demanufacture\\" is one of the best pieces of metal music to come out of the 1990's. Period. Upon its release nearly ten years ago, it was landmark, and coming out in the midst of the grunge heavy airwaves, it really showed that heavy music was still alive and intact. A huge step up from the band's debut \\"Soul Of A New Machine\\" (which was an overwhelmingly death metal heavy album), \\"Demanufacture\\" brought a lot of new things to the table to add to FF's sound, which they had picked up from their \\"Fear Is The Mind Killer EP\\", particularly the spacy keyboards, and the haunting samples. This added to the already amazingly brutal sound that Fear Factory had established does wonders. Opening up with the timeless classic title track \\"Demanufacture\\", the album will drop your jaw, and leave it there for the rest of the album. Immediately you'll notice Dino's powerful, crunching riffs which can batter you during the verse, only slip into a calming rhythm during the chorus. The keyboards and spacy atmosphere really help to elevate Dino's guitar playing. Raymond's drumming is exactly what Fear Factory was going for on this release; have a drum sound that sounds like it is being played by a drum machine, but have it actually be a drummer. And that's exactly what this is. His powerful driving rhythms and plentiful use of the double bass petal elevate the new dynamic sound of the band to further heights. Add in Christian's flawless, but heavy bass playing, and you can see why tracks like \\"Zero Signal\\" and \\"New Breed\\" are such classics. Along with the magnificent playing of the band, vocalist Burton C. Bell really comes into his own on this release, showing that he can scream his lungs out with one of the most brutal growls around, only to slip into a melodic croon that is reminiscent of today's metal scene. Check tracks like \\"Replica\\" and \\"Flashpoint\\" to see how well his vocal capabilities have grown since their debut album. The lyrics are especially fitting for the album. While \\"Soul Of A New Machine\\" was death heavy (then again is was most definitely a death metal album), and the following album \\"Obsolete\\" would be a sci-fi epic, \\"Demanfacture\\" contains passages about exactly what the band was going through at the time. The opening track \\"Demanufacture\\" illustrates this perfectly when Burton screams \\"I've got no more G*ddamn regrets, I've got no more G*ddamn respect\\". Tracks like \\"Self Bias Resistor\\" and \\"New Breed\\" look at the state of society, while \\"Replica\\" and \\"A Therapy For Pain\\" show Burton dealing with personal struggles. The band does manage to sneek in a sci-fi tuned theme for the record, with their marvellous \\"H-K (Hunter Killer)\\" which shows the direction they would explore on their next record. In the end \\"Demanfacture\\" was a classic back in 1995, and it can still match up with any top metal album today, making it carry that much more weight. Not many albums have been influential in shaping the sound of their respected genre, but Fear Factory achieved allthat and more with this release. The remastering has done wonders for the sound of the record, so even if you own the original, you might want to pick this one up anyway just to see how amazing it still sounds with the new production elements. <br /> <br />The re-issue is a 2cd collector's edition, so you know there's going to be some great extras coming with this one. The first disc is the epic \\"Demanufacture\\", the digipak bonus tracks, and a few remixed songs. The second disc is the entire \\"Remanufacture\\" remix album and 4 other other remixes that were found on the \\"Hateflies\\" release. I still consider \\"Remanufacture\\" to be an essential piece of the band's discography, and this is an easy way to get ahold of it, if you never owned it to begin with. You really haven't heard the total beauty of Fear Factory's sound until you've heard it remixed. The re-issue is an obvious attempt to bring back fans who may have drifted away from the band in its later years, or who somehow have never heard this beautiful masterpiece. There is not one thing about this cd set which I can honestly complain about (except as with all the other re-issues, Roadrunner has decided that glueing the cd book down inside the set is a good idea). <br /> <br />\\"Demanufacture\\" is a timeless album, and this release 10 years after the original shows how much power this album can still pack. Fans of Fear Factory need not be without this album, even if you own the originals. The crisp remastering, and the bonuses are more than enough to warrant this a necessary purchase. If you like modern metal or any form of heavy music, and you've somehow never come across Fear Factory's masterpiece \\"Demanufacture\\", then do yourself a giant favor, and pick this cd immediately. It will probably be some of the best money you've ever spent on music. To say the least, this is a classic piece of metal music, and to say the most, this an absolute masterpiece that no fan of heavy music should not own. Get this as soon as possible.
B000002UUH|5.0|That fatidic day signed the physical departure of Lennon but also meant the birth of a musical legend. Lennon was the active creator, the irreverent wing of the Beatles, the troublemaker, the inexhaustible peace fighter.<br /><br />In our memory are still fresh the first signals of an unavoidable breakthrough in the early seventies. Since that moment the artistic profile of Lennon literally acquired a new dimension, his fertile imagination and unquestionable lyricism made of him one of the last exponents of the beat generation, in the tradition of Bob Dylan or Donovan. Lennon was an openhearted creator, he opened sliding doors and allowed to convey the concerns and existential anguish of all a non faith generation. And his themes were poems transformed in songs: Since the first bars of my first choice of his first age: Instant Karma, the barefaced cry of loneliness and bitterness expressed in Mother, or the universal song of Give Peace a chance, his personal poem dedicated to Yoko: Woman, or his undoubted masterpiece: Imagine, work that would become his immortal hymn that still engages the newcomer listeners.<br /><br />This is a sad day, but also an opportunity to think about him, wherever he is. In the name of so many people who are reminding him through his records at this precise moment, or visiting his New York Department, Farewell and let' s enjoy because he followed and achieved his bliss.
B000002MY3|5.0|The honesty in her lyrics are what touches me to the core. Alanis manages to use playful qualities in her lyrics to capture the attention of the listener as she rattles off playful lines that are quick-witted and are easy to miss if the listener is not paying attention. Even simple lines like, \\"And all I need now is intellectual intercourse, A soul to dig the hole much deeper,\\" shows that she thinks in an abstract way. <br /> <br />Every song on this album is meaningful and contributes to one of my favorite albums of all time. There isn't a song on here that I do not like. This is the first cd I purchased when I was a kid and all of the songs bring me back. I wasn't initially satified with every song until I heard the reinterpretation of the songs on her Jagged Little Pill Acoustic album and at her concert at the Orpheum Theater in Minneapolis, Minnesota. I was fortunate enough to see her second concert in the tour and she was amazing. Her energy and personality shown through her lyrics and washed over me. <br /> <br />The lyrics get me thinking about growing up, the frantic thoughts of just living one day to the next, and what my past has done to my future. <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor and pick up this album. Not for the controversy of a song actually saying the word \\"f*ck\\" but because this music is art. This album didn't sell over 30 million copies worldwide for nothing. I have five copies of this cd that I managed to pick up in junk shops and I could always use more. That may make me sound like a loser...but...I have a weak spot for this beautiful Canadian rock singer. <br /> <br />--=Teagan=--
055321263X|3.0|The above title refers to Collins's avowed formula for writing a novel, and wait the readers certainly did when this book first came out in serial form from 1859-1860-as for laughing and crying, I shall simply have to suppose, with the novel's success as evidence, that many did.<br /><br />  You will like this book if you are capable of suspending your critical faculties and imagining yourself alive at the time it was written. In that sense, it makes for a comfortable transport into a different era, where all the \\"good\\" fictional characters behaved in this contrived, upright Victorian fashion.  But it is this very contrivance, to which Collins readily admitted, that renders this book only perhaps a little above mediocre.-Compare it to the truly great writers of Victorian England such as the Brontes, who broke new ground by writing impassioned novels from the depths of their souls, to Collins's crafty manifesto (the title above) and perhaps you'll see how clear is the difference between great literature and writing that panders to the common denominator among readers. The Brontes, especially Charlotte, wrote works which are autobiographical and true to their own thoughts and feelings, while Collins, on the other hand, cannily wrote this ever so proper suspense novel while openly keeping two mistresses, Carolina Graves and Martha Rudd, under his roof and enduring their daily catfights, and moreover overindulging in his taste for laudanum, which led to a lifelong addiction.<br /><br />  So, if you fancy this sort of thing, being led along through an England that existed as Victorian readers wished it to be rather than it actually was by a writer whose stated aim was to dupe you, this \\"classic\\" is for you. He does this exceedingly well, so it's not a total loss.<br /><br />  It's really no marvel that the arch-villain and deceiver Count Fosco comes across as the most memorable character in this work. Here, Collins WAS writing about what he knew.
0553801503|3.0|I was anxiously awaiting this book for years, then found myself having to drag myself through it once it arrived.  I suppose after the cataclysms and upheavals of the previous installment this one was doomed to have a slower pace and more fragmented nature.  But I really didn't expect the feeling of having to drag myself through it - and still, at the end, very little has advanced or been resolved.  A Storm Of Swords kept me up all night; Feast put me to sleep early.
B000BVEKO0|5.0|KoRn have done it yet again with See You On The Other Side, this album ROCKS! Every song on the album kicks A$$! KoRn have reinvented their sound yet again, this time taking on a more groove friendly/Industrial approach and it works well. Some stand out tracks on here are: Twisted Transistor (Awesome first single, and catchy), Politics (it's nice to hear Jon singing about some new things), Hypocrites (awesome song, but better live imo), Souvenir, and Open Up (which is my favorite track on the whole album). Album closer, Tearjerker is a nice change of pace and one of the best album closer songs since Issues' Dirty. The 6 b-sides from the album: It's Me Again, Eaten Up Inside, Last Legal Drug (Le Petit Mort), Appears, Too Late I'm Dead, and Inside Out are also worth checking out.
0307276902|5.0|This book is a MUST read.  The journey that James travels is familiar to anyone dealing with addiction problems. His view on how recovery must happen is refreshing as no one method works for everyone.  This is a true vivid picture of an addict. It should be added to every summer reading list. I am insisting that my 19 and 15 year old sons read the book to see how glamorous and \\"cool\\" drugs and alcohol really are.
B000002UJQ|5.0|By now everyone knows this is a great album. Perhaps it's too soon to say, but Ok Computer, along with Kid A, may represent Radiohead at their peak. Nearly every song on the album is a modern classic.<br /><br />  If you are new to Radiohead, this is an excellent CD to begin with, as it showcases everything that makes this band great. Thom Yorke's slurred lyrics meld seamlessy with the sonic soundscapes for a revelatory listening experience.<br /><br />  Because of this masterpiece, I am even willing to forgive Radiohead for having inspired whiny, tiresome bands like Coldplay to make the scene. If you're tired of filler then try this; it's the real thing.
0930289455|5.0|The first time I read the Killing Joke I sat and thought, \\"Finally someone has given the Joker the treatment he so richly deserves.\\"  Alan Moore's writing draws us into the Joker's twisted, sick view of reality.  The Joker now, is beyond redemption, a sick, giggling, sociopath.  His sadistic torture of Jim Gordon, and his cold-blooded shooting of Barbara Gordon leaves us in no doubt that he is a pyschopath with no remorse, only a sick sense of humour.  However his back story, told in flashback brings a once human face to the Batman's arch-nemesis and gives us an insight into Moore's seminal interpretation of the Joker's origin. <br /> <br />Whilst staying faithful to the sketchy outlines given in previous stories, the bad choices from good intentions and tragedy that lead up to the events that created the Joker make us more sympathic to who he was, whilst still giving us the Joker at his most dark and evil.  His descent from decent loser to twisted evil murderous clown is all the more powerful for these details, whilst still leaving things open for others to interpret, \\"Sometimes I remember it one way, sometimes another.....\\" <br /> <br />The story itself is simple, The Joker shoots and cripples Barbara Gordon, kidnaps Jim Gordon himself and tries to drive him insane whilst Batman tracks him downs and saves the day isn't exactly full of twists and turns.  What makes this one of the definitive Batman stories is Moore's delving into the pyschological motivations of Batman and the Joker.  They are Two-Face's coin.  One face fair, the other scarred, twin faces.  As the Joker proclaims in the graphic novel, \\"All it takes is a bad day.  Just one bad day.\\" <br /> <br />And this is the place where Moore begins his exploration of the pysches of these two intertwined characters.  One the one hand, Batman, whose reaction to his \\"one bad day\\" is to be driven by his inner demons to go out into the night dressed as \\"a flying rodent\\" to try to fight a war that he cannot win.  Thisis what gives Batman such pathos.  The Joker's reaction to his \\"one bad day\\" is to descend into insanity.  He justifies his actions to himself by trying to convince himself that everyone else would be like him, if only they had suffered what he has suffered.  At the end he recognises that this belief is false, but he clings to it nevertheless, trapped in the insanity  that now consumes him.  This is just the Joker pathos too, and in my opinion the best villians and heros have pathos. <br /> <br />Both were transformed by their \\"one bad day\\", one into a man trying impose order and justice to chaos, and the other into becoming the embodiment of that chaos. <br /> <br />Brian Bolland's outstanding artwork should not be overlooked either.  His visual characterisation of the Joker has become iconic, and his detailed style brings the Joker to life in a way that no one else had done before.  In combination with Alan Moore's writing, they combine to provide a piece of work that transcends the negative connotations that labelling it a comic would give it. <br /> <br />The final scenes of the book, where Batman confronts the Joker, and tries to reason with him, appealing to him in the knowledge that their continued war will only bring about the death or either or both of them is truly touching, and the Joker's final rejection only forbodes further evil from the Clown Prince of Crime. <br /> <br />I know I am hyping this, but there are some Batman graphic novels that any self respecting Bats fan needs to own.  The Dark Knight Returns, Batman : Year One, Batman : The Long Halloween, Arkham Asylum, Hush vol I and Vol II, Batman : Dark Victory and of course The Killing Joke.  There are some graphic novels that any self-respecting comic book fan ought to own, V for Vendetta and From Hell to choose a couple from Alan Moore's work. <br /> <br />And there are some that everyone should own, just to remind people that sometimes, just sometimes, a comic or graphic novel will come alongthat shocks you and astounds your expectations.  The Killing Joke, along with Dark Knight Returns and The Watchmen is one of those. <br /> <br />In the forthcoming sequel to Batman Begins, I only hope that it is this interpretation of the Joker that Nolan brings to the screen, because it is this Joker which is the truly the arch-nemesis that Batman deserves.  I can't recommend this one highly enough.
B000007R1M|5.0|While a lot of critics rate Trans-Europe Express as the definitive Kraftwerk album, for me they get no better than Man Machine. Retro and futuristic at once, this album was at least ten years ahead of its time. It's sad to me that electronic pioneers like Kraftwerk do not have the mass recognition they deserve.<br /><br />Part of what makes this particular cd compelling is the balance struck between the imperfect, very human vocals and the majestically mechanical music. The lyrics are quirky and the tunes are quite catchy.<br /><br />When Pink Floyd travelled to the Dark Side of the Moon, they found Kraftwerk had already been there for some time, at the cutting edge of progressive electronic music.
B0002IVN9W|3.0|Actually, that's a bit snarky. Forgive me, but I just don't see what all the fuss is about. Decent, but not stellar, little indie band.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|I bought this cd after hearing and seeing the video for precious and hearing on VH-1's Hanging With, with Depeche Mode that this cd was getting great praise. At first listen I was starting to doubt whether or not I made a mistake but after I listen to it a couple times and got used to it. I fell in love with it. I can't seem to get the music out of my head. Some songs maybe a little on the slow side but the lyrics,the way the music is written had left me hooked. Each song is catchy in it's own way. Some of the noisy electric static sound effects aren't bad and the loud synth at the begining of the first song maybe a little annoying at start but I had to get used to it. The entire cd is one that I'm proud of owning. The other cds that I own by DM are Music For The Masses, Violator and both Singles CDs. I can't see how not having Playing The Angel in my collection would be complete.  <br />
B000002AGN|5.0|I first heard this some 25 years ago, and it was love at first hearing. Featuring one of jazz's all time best known compositions, Take Five, a wonderful kind of musical dialogue between Brubeck and alto sax player, Paul Desmond (who wrote the piece), the entire recording - with such standout cuts as Blue Rondo A La Turk, Kathy's Waltz, and Pick Up Sticks - evokes a kind of brainy, moody 1950s world of cool. It's a world I want to go to from time to time, and this classic of cool jazz is just the ticket there. Years later, Brubeck and his talented sons would play some fine music together; however, here is the place to hear this legendary figure as a young turk, and his tight, talented quartet, as they produce a recording which still sounds fresh.
0743454529|3.0|Jodi Picoult writes an extremely provocative book that engenders rich discussion of the dynamics of familial love, duty, and medical ethics.  For this reason alone, I recommend the book to clubs, as conversation is guaranteed to be animated and lively. Our group had a grand time, as we were composed of mothers who are also lawyers, physicians, nurses, professors, and research scientists; liberals and conservatives. (... and tigers and bears! Oh my!)<br /><br />Assume: a child conceived for the sole purpose of providing cord blood to an older sibling. As if that isn't rife enough  with potential  psychological trauma, what happens when one embarks down the slippery slope of  \\"just one blood draw\\"?  \\" Well, just one more?\\" \\"Just one bone marrow transplant?\\" `How about a kidney?\\" What rights do the parents have? The donor? The recipient? What about the fifth wheel sibling who is not part of the patient/savior dynamic? Well pass the red wine, we all had something to say.<br /><br />Having stated that, I confess I strongly disliked several aspects of the book. Characters are one-dimensional predictable stereotypes.  Frankly, the only character I liked was the one who consistently gave of himself unconditionally and with total and complete altruism: Judge the Dog. I wanted to smack everyone else.  The legal scenes are improbable or impossible (no judge would have permitted Sara to represent herself, and the ridiculous cross examination of Brian by Sara proves the reasoning ).<br /><br />The so-called shock twist of an ending was no surprise; I figured it out half way through; it was inevitable, and from a literary standpoint Picoult really had no choice. I applaud her for seeing that necessity.<br /><br />Having watched my own dear sister lose her six year old to cancer, I did not want to read any more details of bone marrow, stem cells, portacaths, remission, and pediatric pain. So perhaps my own medical, and legal prejudices have left me jaded and immune to the virtues of this work that so many reviewers extol. Regardless, this timely book makes a contribution to current ethical debate, and the overall consciousness of our society, and that is very fine indeed.wers extol.

B0002XH9Z4|3.0|This package is as much a psychological document as Freud's Interpretation of Dreams, or the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, and, if listened to carefully, is an epic expression of one man's descent into madness. For disk 1 contains the true MJ/Jackson 5/Jacksons classics, with one brief moment in which MJ sounds truly at peace with himself, namely the songs Dancing Machine, Enjoy Yourself, and Shake Your Body. Ironically, these are from an era in which he released a solo record which, in my humble opinion, is his masterpiece, namely, Off the Wall. Of course, it was also during this period in which MJ records start to sound a bit slick and overproduced. An interesting era, however, this was, an angry period of punk, new wave, and early hip-hop; Michael Jackson was probably too busy counting his money and enjoying his solo success to even notice these trends.<br /><br />Disk 2 naturally documents the Thriller era, a time in which MJ was the omnipresent superstar celebrity. And the more the public learned about such matters as Michael and: Bubbles, McCauley Culkin, the Elephant Man's bones, friendships with Liza and Liz, fake romances with the likes of Brook Shields, etc., the more the public was .... bewildered? confused? intrigued? Just not quite suspicious of MJ's more sinister side, or of his fragile mind/grasp of reality. That would come later, along with the skin bleachings, plastic surgeries and Jesus Juice.<br /><br />Musically, its interesting listening to MJ trying to sound like a hard rocker on the utterly formulaic State of Shock; one can picture his duet partner, Mick Jagger, trying hard not to smirk too much, as Keith Richard and Charlie Watts shake their heads in disgust. The Thriller tunes sound like the classic hits that they were; I would imagine that they provoke much nostaligia heard now for those who grew up listening to them.<br /><br />Of course, things get very interesting with disk 3, as MJ, again, tries to convince us that he's \\"bad\\", though three cuts later, he gives us I Just Can't Stop Loving You, a song no thug would be capable of. We can see megalomania (along with tons of insecurity) setting in, in the form of such songs as The Man in the Mirror, Dirty Diana (in which MJ imagines what enjoyable sex with a woman might be, perhaps in another lifetime; in the meantime, girls are \\"dangerous\\") and Who Is It. Actually, the best cut on disk three is one which, surprisingly, was not a hit, the relatively relaxed, mild funk Monkey Business. I'm not even sure what he's singing about, and it matters not. He simply sounds in control of the song. In many of the others, he sounds like the cog in the \\"hit making\\" machine, a factor of market driven industrial production. It's no wonder he sounds, and is, so alone. Significantly, the disk ends with a plea by the emotionally needy MJ for someone to reach out to him and to love him unconditionally.<br /><br />Finally, on disk 4, each song is a psychological text unto itself. You Are Not Alone is about as syrupy and maudlin as can be. Of course, it was a hit, as MJ had, by that point, expanded his market globally, and proved that there was a worldwide market for all things syrupy and maudlin. Stranger in Moscow, driven by synthetic sounding arrangements sounds wistful, as MJ imagines himself as some kind of international superhero (superego) type figure. A number of the songs here sound like rehashes of earlier songs, as MJ attempts to return to his Thriller/Bad glory days. The centerpiece here, though, is probably the Free Willy song, Childhood, a glorious paean to the wonders of childhood, a state of being which MJ imagines is a shangri la (in spite of his own). It's so over the top, backed by swelling orchestral arrangements a la classic Disney movies, as MJ releases his inner demons in the form of kiddy worship. We should have read this as the writing on the wall that it so obviously is. As I listen to it, I shudder at just how outright creepy it is. I'm sure some heard it as pretty; of course, some folks think that the Police's Every Breath You Take is a pure love song, and not an expression of derangement; and of course, the thoroughly sane Sting and company were simply exploring derangement through song; here we have a documentation of a man becoming deranged, with the music the direct expression of his downward spiral.<br /><br />My rating: 3 stars, for some classic dance/pop tunes, for lots of maudlin, syrupy balladry, and ultimately, for a documentation of a truly fascinating and deeply odd figure of late 20th century global entertainment.epy it is.

B00005AQE8|5.0|It's almost pointless to review this album as everyone and their parents know what this album is, literally. Who hasn't heard this album? This put 2Pac into superstar status. This album was made quickly and so was \\"Makaveli the don killuminati - The 7 Day Theory\\" because 2Pac wanted to complete his 3 album contract with Death Row Records and move on to start his own label Makaveli Records. It's hard to believe he made these songs so fast pumping out almost three finished tracks a day and almost all became classic hits. It's true that there are a few filler tracks like \\"What's Ya Phone #\\" but even those fit this album. Disc one is definitely better then disc two but disc two starts to grow on you and soon you find yourself loving most of the tracks on it also. My only complaint with this album is that it doesn't really show 2Pac's real side. He doesn't touch on political subjects really or try to be the leader, role model or caring person he really was. This album is all about Thug Life and partying with a few stand out tracks that go back to his \\"Me Against The World\\" personality with tracks like \\"Shorty Wanna Be A Thug\\", \\"Life Goes On\\" & \\"I Ain't Mad At Cha\\". I think it's obvious this album is also the reason The Notorious B.I.G. made his \\"Life After Death\\" (another amazing album i own) to compete with this album. You can also find a DualDisc version with music videos on it at Amazon.<br /><br />My favorite tracks are:<br /><br />-----------------------<br /><br />Ambition Az A Ridah<br /><br />All Bout U<br /><br />Skandalouz<br /><br />How Do U Want It<br /><br />2 Of Americaz Most Wanted<br /><br />No More Pain<br /><br />Life Goes On<br /><br />California Love (Remix)<br /><br />I Ain't Mad At Cha<br /><br />Can't C Me<br /><br />Shorty Wanna Be A Thug<br /><br />Holla At Me<br /><br />Wonda Why They Call U<br /><br />Thug Passion<br /><br />Picture Me Rollin'<br /><br />Rather Be Ya<br /><br />All Eyez On Me<br /><br />Ain't Hard 2 Find<br /><br />Heaven Ain't Hard 2 Find<br /><br />If you love this album then I recommend you also pick up Makaveli \\"The 7 Day Theory\\" and The Notorous B.I.G. \\"Life After Death\\". Forget that East Vs West feud that ended when they died and just enjoy great music. That fued was never about East or West anyway which you'll hear 2Pac say on Makaveli so get a copy now!so pick up Makaveli \\"The 7 Day Theory\\" and The Notorous B.I.G. \\"Life After Death\\".

Unfortunately, I think she hid it somewhere.  Anyway, the book is fun to read and really holds a baby's attention.  Some of her first giggling was during the \\"cock-a-doodle-doo\\" while I would read this book to her.  It is a definite must for any baby's book collection.

0743454537|4.0|This novel was really a page turner.  It was fairly well written and concise.  The only thing I really had a problem with was the ending.  It was a strange way to end such a long book.  I guess I was expecting something different.
0385512058|5.0|My first experience with Keith Ferrazzi and his remarkable mindset for success was through an article which I read in INC. magazine.  I read it, then reread it, then read it again.  Finally, I tore the article out, put it into a folder and carried it in my briefcase for months.  <br /> <br />Whenever I was preparing for a meeting, planning negotiations or attempting to deepen relationships with a potential new business partner, I would take out the article and read it again.  It never failed to get my creative juices flowing or to get me pumped up before an important meeting. <br /> <br />Now Ferrazzi has taken the ideas for personal and professional success he sketched out in that magazine article and detailed them in an extraordinary book Never Eat Alone and Other Secrets to Success, One Relationship at a Time (Currency-Doubleday, 2005) with Tahl Raz.  While a business book in every sense, it reads as a personal story of a true individualist who has discovered through his own triumphs and failures that there is one major skill needed for success in business today: the ability to build relationships. <br /> <br />What Ferrazzi describes is not the typical networking-as-usual tool employed by the insincere, ruthlessly ambitious glad handlers you meet at Chamber of Commerce meetings with a martini in one hand and a stack of business cards in the other.  What he proposes is a philosophy both of business and life.  He opens Chapter One of the book with a quote from Margaret Wheatley: \\"Relationships are all there is.  Everything in the universe only exists because it is in relationship to everything else.  Nothing exists in isolation. We have to stop pretending we are individuals that can go it alone.\\"  <br /> <br />Ferrazzi's book is an action plan to that statement.  Do you want to achieve business success?  Do you want personal success?  The secret is all about reaching out to other people.  He bases that philosophy on the simple idea of generosity, helping people connect with other people.  There is no difference between life and work-both are about people, he says.  By becoming the center of a circle of relationships, you can succeed through life.   <br /> <br />Ferrazzi adeptly shares his own business and life experiences to illustrate his philosophy.  The son of a cleaning lady and a steelworker, he tells how he developed his ability to connect with others to help him gain a scholarship at Yale, a Harvard MBA and later several executive positions.  He was named one of Crain's 40 under 40 and a Global Leader for Tomorrow by the Davos World Economic Forum.   <br /> <br />His philosophy can be-and should be-utilized by everyone.  His book details a system for reaching out to people using proven, practical principles, including:   <br /> <br />Never eat alone:  Invisibility is a fate worse than failure. Reach out to others; build a network.  The more new connections you make, the more opportunities you'll have to make more new connections.  <br />Do your homework:  Preparation is the key to genius.  Whom you meet and how they react to you is dependent upon your preparation and strategy. <br />\\"Ping\\" constantly:  While it takes effort, stay in touch with people constantly, not just when you need something.   <br />Balance is B.S.:    When the key to life is the relationships in it, there is no need to compartmentalize work from personal life, family or friends.  In the end, we all live one life-and that life is about the people in it. <br /> <br />In Never Eat Alone  Keith Ferrazzi gives us a clear strategy for success in the new future:  you can only succeed within the context of your relationships to others.  What's important isn't the ability to read a spread sheet or a new piece of technology.  It ultimately comes down to people.  For anyone interested in real success, this book is a must read. Read it, study it and carry it around in your briefcase for a few months.  It is absolutely worth its weight.   <br />
0792164903|5.0|Not the traditional tale from Tim Burton. Herein, there be witches!<br /><br />Ichabod Crane {Johnny Depp} is a forensic investigator who, after being assigned to the case by Judge Burgomaster {Christopher Lee}, travels from New York to enchanted Sleepy Hollow, following up on some grisly murders where the victims were all beheaded.<br /><br />With his various devices, his logic is challenged as the superstitious villagers lend their perspective on the mysterious 'Headless Horseman', who appears from out of a magnifient skeletal tree, an entrance to Hell, as well as a direct confrontation. Some history is provided on how 'The Hessian Horseman' {Christopher Walken; a Vlad-like warrior} became the phantom figure, and meets love interest 'Katrina' {Christina Ricci}, who turns out to be a latent 'white witch', whose protective spells save him in the end.<br /><br />There is a very interesting twist at the finale, where it is revealed who the true puppeteer is, thus connecting the sub-plots.<br /><br />Marvellous camera angles, special effects which compliment the story instead of distracting, splendid darkly elegant visuals, a 'gothic' adventure, and a most intriguing version of this delighfully ghastly tale comprises this pleasing adaptation of Sleepy Hollow.<br /><br />Tim Burton continues to create marvellous de-facto Satanic productions {virtually ALL visuals, and most characterizations}, combined with Danny Elfman's ingenious orchestrations, makes for a truly powerful combination, both of which are frequent pleasures.
076790592X|5.0|Tuesdays with Morrie....Wow just thinking about that makes me want to read it over and over.  I have shared this book with many people and I reccomend EVERYONE to read it. Morrie is battling in ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease he still smiles and  gives a great meaning to be alive. He shows us that there are many obstacles that we have to face in life but the biggest one is learning how to deal with death in order to live. His exact quote is \\" Learn how to die and you learn how to live.\\" This is very true.Many times we take life for granted and complain and complain. So I ask you when do plan on having time to enjoy life?? What if today is your last day.  This is just one topic Morrie makes you think about others include fear, marriage, forgiving, culture, emotions and family. I 'd love to leave you with something that inspired me that he said in his book \\"So many people walk around with a meaning less life. They seem half asleep, even when they're busy doing things that they think are important. This is because they're chasing the wrong things. The way you get meaning to your life is to devote yourself to your community around you, devote yourself to creating something that gives you purpose and meaning.\\"
B000B8QEZG|1.0|Now I am not a madonna hater, look at my review history, I have given Madonna albums 5 stars! <br /> But Madonna's new 2005 release \\"Confessions on a dance floor\\" has showed that she is not only desperate for attention, but has also ripped off her fans of their money for this awful, boring, and flat album. <br />On november 15th, i ran to my local record store to purchase this album, I thought madonna could do no wrong. But i was horrificly dissapointed when I listening to this tripe. Not only are all the songs montonous and souless, half of them are not even dancey! Songs like Issac, Like it or not, and Let it will be show that she has lost her creative genius.  <br />However, the record does have a FEW decent songs, noticeably \\"push\\" and \\"jump\\" But both are not worthy of spending $15.00 <br />In conclusion, stay away from this awful, boring, and montonous album, get Mariah Carey's \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" instead.  <br />
B00008AWOG|4.0|Opeth's fourth album, 1999's \\"Still Life,\\" was the group's first with bassist Martin Mendez, and also their most popular album (in terms of sales) among their first four releases. \\"Still Life\\" is similar to its predecessor, \\"My Arms, Your Hearse\\" (which was released only a year before this album), because it's a concept album. It tells the story of a man who returns home (after years of being gone), and searches for his loved one (who's referred to as Melinda). And though she is engaged to be married to another man, she is still in love with him. But even though this album is similar to \\"Hearse\\" in that regard, \\"Still Life\\" is also like Opeth's second album, \\"Morningrise,\\" because the songs on here are so long. No, this record doesn't have any twenty minute songs, but every track is over five minutes long and most of them are over nine minutes. As with their first three discs, Opeth continue to perfect their traditional sound, here, by blending violent death metal with light, progressive rock elements. The result is an album with a very technical, creative, and bold contrast which allows both sides of Opeth to shine through equally as bright. Frontman Mikael Akerfeldt's vocals are stellar like usual, because he seamlessly jumps from mean, deep-voiced barks to calm, supple crooning. The two main highlights on here are the immensely-almost monstrously-heavy second track, \\"Godhead's Lament,\\" and \\"Benighted,\\" which is entirely soft and pretty, with lonely acoustic plunking. So, with all of the qualities that is has, the songs on this record are about as great as great can get. Unfortunately, as a whole, \\"Still Life\\" isn't a very far departure from Opeth's first three albums. It would take a very hardcore fan and well-trained ear to distinguish between songs like \\"Serenity Painted Death\\" and \\"White Cluster\\" (which are fairly typical tracks) and any song on \\"My Arms, Your Hearse.\\" The epic, eleven and a half minute long album opener, \\"The Moor,\\" is a prime example of most of the rest of the album. It begins slowly, with light, distant guitar strumming, and the acoustics enter around two minutes in. But the pounding electric guitar riffs come aboard soon thereafter, and the song stays heavy until about six minutes later (where there's a dreamy, acoustic breakdown). The power chords come back, however, about two and a half minutes later, and finish the song on a strong note. Some of the songs (like \\"Moonlapse Vertigo,\\" which is a propulsive rocker with a surging guitar attack), should stay heavy and do without the soft breakdowns, and some of the songs (i.e. the stunningly beautiful, lightly strummed, and drearily sung fifth track, \\"Face of Melinda\\") would be better suited if they were completely soft. Unfortunately, it's usually (except for the aforementioned \\"Godhead's Lament\\" and \\"Benighted\\") just a matter of time before there's a heavy or soft tempo change. Knowing that most every song is going to have one of these breakdowns makes \\"Still Life\\" kind of predictable. But, because the listener never knows WHEN the sudden, breakneck tempo change is going to kick in, these songs are never boring. So, \\"Still Life\\" is very good, but not great. It's worth buying for the hardcore Opeth fan, and (since the songs are so great and a good representation of the band) it's also worth buying for newcomers. But if you're a casual fan, or a fan who can only hear the same album so many times, I still recommend you check this album out, but hear a few songs, first, before buying it.of the rest of the album.

B0007Y08IS|5.0|I was a fan of South Park a few years back, and the South Park movie was really the peak of the series popularity.  I used to love it, but slowly stopped watching it as the series really did run out of ideas a little.  Then I heard about Team America, as soon as I knew it was directed by Matt Stone & Trey Parker I had to watch it, and it doesn't dissapoint.<br /><br />First thing to say is like South Park, the soundtrack is brilliant, I was literally pi**ing myself with laughter after hearing the theme tune the first time.  In fact you could get the soundtrack and laugh at that almost as much as the film.  The puppeteering is great and funny at the same time, the jokes are obviously a little childish, but if like me you laugh at that kind of thing, you'll enjoy this.  Other highlights are the undercover disguise, if you've seen it you'll know what I mean, but best of all is the puppet sex scene, you have to see this it is hilarious.<br /><br />I see a lot of negative reviews below mine and i'm not really sure why.  As a non American I laughed especially at the opening scenes in Paris, as that is exactly how much of the rest of the world perceive the American Army.  Im not dissing America, in fact I love America but you have to laugh at the portrayal of America as shoot first ask questions later.  Basically if you liked Trey Parker & Matt Stone's stuff before you will love this, South Park style comedy, but with a political background (albeit jokingly).
B000B2UPGQ|5.0|The Lost Weekend was when many fans breathed a sigh of relief for a year and a half when John & Yoko seperated.  This was a roller-coaster period for him as we all know.  \\"Nobody Loves You (When You're Down and Out)\\" describes this.  \\"Whatever Gets You Through the Night\\" gave him his first solo #1 in the US, and agreed to appear with Elton John at Madison Square Garden, which was the last real concert Lennon did.  \\"Ya Ya\\", a '50s chestnut recorded in ordinace with the legal settlement with Morris Levy over \\"Come Together\\" (you know the story, he'd say), has son Julian on snare drum.<br /><br />This is supposed to be the next album to be reissued and remastered by Yoko.  She only had this one out in the land of her birth.  She should add all the originals from \\"Menlove Avenue\\", a 1987 release she of course set up, as well as the B-side \\"Move Over Ms. L\\", and maybe some long lost material held in storage at the Dakota and/or the Capitol/EMI vaults.
B00003CXD0|5.0|I must have seen 'Tootsie' over twenty times and the more I see it the more brilliant it is.I love everything about it-the acting-the comedy,the meaning and THE CAST!!!!!Dustin Hoffman,Jessica Lange,Bill Murry,Teri Garr,Dabney Colman,Charles Durning-all turning in terrific performances.Now to the film itself-'Tootsie' is a hilereous yet sensative portrayal of an arrogent male chauvanist actor named Michael Dorsey (Hoffman) who's agent insists he's unhirable.So he 'invents' a new character for himself in the BEYOND out spoken 'Dorthy' Michaels and lands a job in a soap opera intended for his overly sensative girlfriend Sandy (Garr)'Dorthy's' antics and star power bring fame to her but confusion to Dorsey,who finds himself falling in love with his beautiful co star Julie (Lange) who's kind and lonely dad Les (Durning) wants to marry 'Dorthy'.Even incognito Michael Dorsey learns to see things through a woman's point of few-on the soap opera 'Dorthy' is condecsended to and often taken advantage of by the cast and crew,to the point where she begins improvising her lines-leading to this movie's funniest moments.But sadly 'Dorthy's world falls apart fast due to a series of confusing events-a box of chocolates from Les leads Sandy to think Michael is gay,'Dorthy' nearly locks lips with Julie leading her to think 'Dorthy' is a lesbian and the people at the soap want 'Dorthy' on for another year.So in the end Michael Dorsey invents a bizzare story to explain why his character is in fact 'not Emily Kimberly.IT'S EDWARD KIMBERLY!EDWARD KIMBERLY!!!,leading to one of the most funny scenes in the movie as well as the most shocking.Yes once the deception is revealed Michael's career goes through the roof but he alienates Sandy,earns a belt in the chops from Julie and breaks Les's heart.The movie ends on an open note as he regains speaking terms with Julie and admits he was 'a better woman with her then a man and just needed to do it without the dress'.And as not to offend Julie further he finds a way to maintaina friendship with Les who admits to finding Michael Dorsey to be 'okay company'.I think outside the laugh a minute comedy and the twists and turns this movie has a nice message to it about understanding sexual sensativity and the opposit sex.So even though there's 'drag' involved this is not a gay movie-it has to to with male/female relationships and the resulting twists and turns.And it does it remarkably.further he finds a way to maintaina friendship with Les who admits to finding Michael Dorsey to be 'okay company'.I think outside the laugh a minute comedy and the twists and turns this movie has a nice message to it about understanding sexual sensativity and the opposit sex.So even though there's 'drag' involved this is not a gay movie-it has to to with male/female relationships and the resulting twists and turns.And it does it remarkably.
B000AARKOO|2.0|Since I'm interested in the Crusades and was excited when I heard about this film coming out, perhaps my expectations were a bit too high, for this film failed to excite me as I watched it. I didn't feel any strong identity with any of the characters and the story wasn't compelling enough to keep me interested. In the end, it seemed like a colossal waste of money, people's time and talents, and the effort that went into the making of this film. Because it bombed at the box office, it ruins the chance for any future Crusades movie from being made any time soon. <br /> <br />As far as \\"sword and sandal epics\\" go, \\"Gladiator\\" remains the best one that has come out so far, followed by \\"Alexander\\" (which I was pleasantly surprised by that it wasn't as bad as people made it out to be), and \\"Troy\\". I'm about epic-out though, as nothing really compares to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy. This film would have been better to skimped out on the battle sequences (which I suspect most movie goers are tired of) and focused on the political and religious intrigue behind the fight for Jerusalem during the Crusades. <br /> <br />Save your money and time by avoiding this movie. Invest in a good history book about the Crusades and let your imagination run wild. Chances are likely it will be vastly superior to this disappointment of a film.
B000BMSTMS|5.0|12 years, 7 albums, the loss of one original member. The history of Korn is most notable and here they are with their latest album, \\"See You On The Other Side\\".    This album is definitely different and takes a full listen or two to start to get, but then that is the story of every Korn album. I believe that some of the songs on this CD are the best thing Korn has ever done, but then some may be the worst thing Korn has ever done.    It's completely understandable that the boys in Korn felt that what they were doing was getting stale and that they needed to experiment, but in some cases on \\"See You...\\", this experimenting went a bit to far. In their idea of experimenting, it seems that they thought they had to experiment with different genres. Instead, I believe they should have just experimented with different aspects and energies of their current style. Their style was good--awesome--it was their ENERGY that was getting stale, in my opinion.    There are songs on this CD that do not cease to blow me away and give me chills every time. Powerful, epic, gnarly songs. Then, there are songs that are just too out there, too far. And believe me when I say that I can take quite the level of bizarre. There are two kinds of weird when it comes to music. There are weird things that are very different and cool, sometimes creepy, sometimes soothing, that are very effectively good. Korn has ALWAYS been the king of this type of weird (such things as the unusual guitar noises in 'Ball Tongue' all the way to Jon's incredibly entertaining gibberish or \\"skat\\", brought back on \\"See You...\\"). Then there is weird that is simply no longer entertaining, just too weird, bad weird. It's not something that we're \\"just not used to hearing\\" and will \\"get used to over time and appreciate\\", there really are limits. And some of the songs on \\"See You...\\" cross that limit and just make you wanting the song to be over.    If I could advise Korn straight on I would tell them (with all due respect, of course--they are my favorite band afterall), \\"Good experimenting, it was definitely worth crossing the boundaries, but no more of this type thing\\" or \\"that type thing.\\"    Below are my reviews of each song, followed by a solution that very honestly makes \\"See You...\\" possibly the best Korn album made.    1. Twisted Transistor -- very enjoyable song that covers all aspects of Korn's genre. the intro gives me goosebumps every time.  2. Politics -- pretty good, rocking song. the sound is a bit different and more upbeat than conventional Korn songs, but not ruined (just wouldn't be enjoyable as the majority of Korn's sound).  3. Hypocrites -- excellent song. heavy, familiar (but NOT stale), and catchy.  4. Souvenir -- another good song along the same lines as 'Politics'. has a very \\"groovin'\\" feel with a nice, heavy pre-chorus/bridge.  5. 10 or a 2-Way -- now this is where it gets weird. now, i love Korn, but this song is just awful. i gave it a very decent few full listens until completely concluding that i can't stand this song. it's very annoying at times and musically doesn't say anything. this is what i was talking about when i said \\"too weird, too far\\" to the point of non-enjoyment. this song makes 'Wish You Could Be Me' (from \\"Issues\\") seem as normal as 'Blind'.  6. Throw Me Away -- deep, meaningful, powerful song. very \\"Queen of the Damned\\" sounding. not heavy but good, good, good.  7. Love Song -- this one is really on the line as far as weirdness goes. a few parts bug a little bit at first but after a couple listens, it is a strangely appealing song and not completely ruined by its weirder aspects (though just barely).  8. Open Up -- another one like \\"10 or a 2-Way\\", just too out there. the words are very meaningful (seemingly about their ex-member Brian \\"Head\\" Welch) and the chorus is cool, but the verses, bridge, and overall musical sound of the song ruin it all (for me at least).  9. Coming Undone -- this is a cool, laid-back song. the verses are very foot-tap-able and the chorus is hard not to sing along with.  10. Getting Off -- this song represents how things can be different, but a hair away from too far. the verses rock and very much represent Korn's awesome bi-polar feel. also, you have to give David huge props on his totally energized drumwork. awesome job.  11. Liar -- wow. when i heard this song, i said to myself, \\"That might have been the best Korn song ever made.\\" i'll leave it at that.  12. For No One -- another song that deserves big props to David's regenerated drumwork. beyond that, just a generally good song.  13. Seen It All -- no, no, no. too far again. it's a shame too, because the chorus is pretty catchy. but catchy does not always mean good. first off, i wasn't feeling Jon's almost-rapping in the verses and, again, the overall musical sound of the song was not enjoyable. the bridge is, needless to say, very odd (though somewhat appealing in a David Bowie/Labyrinth type way). but the song just made no impact for me.  14. Tearjerker -- well, um... good if you're looking for a song to drift you to sleep, i suppose. but if you are looking for a rockin' Korn song, don't look here. the best way i can describe this song is Korn meets Britney Spears (most likely pushed forward by the former-pop producers of the CD--though Jon isn't quite as nasaly as Spears), i'm sorry, but i'm being honest. but i will give Jon this much, he has a very soothing and beautiful voice. that much is for sure. but the avid headbanger will not enjoy this song.    Bonus Songs  1. It's Me Again -- holy bajesus. can we say \\"Korn has never been so heavy\\"? this song, in all honesty, rivals such gnarly bands as Soulfly and Chimaira (I'd say Slipknot too, but they do not qualify as anything like metal since Vol. 3).  2. Eaten Up Inside -- incredible song. this is a work of genius. one of the best pre-chorus' and chorus' ever. and wow, the drums in the bridge. go David.  3. Last Legal Drug (Le Petit Mort) -- a good show of where electronics can be used effectively and enjoyably. nice, nice song. meaningful too. another one of those songs that it is hard not to sing along with.  4.--5. Twisted Transistor remixes -- yeah, let's not even go there.  6. Appears (need to download it) -- another good, rockin' song. great drumwork and catchy vocals.    So there's my review of each song. Now, here is my advice to you on how to fully enjoy this latest Korn album and I REALLY advise you to take it.    Buy the Deluxe version of the CD, listen to all of it fully if you wish, then mix and burn of copy of the CD with 'Appears' replacing '10 or a 2-Way' (You'll have to download 'Appears' and figure out your own way of having is so you don't need internet connection to play it, otherwise just omit '10 or a 2-Way', trust me), 'Eaten Up Inside' replacing 'Open Up', 'It's Me Again' replacing 'Seen it All', and 'Last Legal Drug (Le Petit Mort)' replacing 'Tearjerker'.    I did this and enjoy the CD so much more now. Korn made all the right and awesome songs for the CD, but--in my strong opinion--chose the wrong ones for the tracklisting. The way that I compiled it above is the way I believe it should have been. It's the most enjoyable and I hope you agree.    Great job to Korn, though. The experimenting was good, as it showed both how far they can go to make good songs and how far they can go to make not-so-good songs. They still get 5 stars, though, because the good songs are rediculously awesome and make this one of the best Korn CD's ever.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm mostly adding my review to this just to further express to anyone who will read through these how absolutely worth it this series is.  I was one of those converted by the movie; long-time fan of Joss Whedon, but was stubborn and refused to give Firefly a try.  Saw Serenity and fell in love.  I watched the entire series in a weekend--bought the box set for myself halfway through, knowing there was no way I was going to be happy *not* owning it for myself.    Now, I've seen every episode at least half a dozen times, and consider the series to be among my all-time favorites, despite the fact that it's only 14 episodes long.  I have never seen a tv show that developed characters and plotlines so strongly in such a short amount of time.  I've never loved an ensemble cast more--and seen one where I wasn't bothered by at least one of the characters.  The series not only set up background and promises of plotlines (ask any fan of the series about Blue Sun and they'll know what you're talking about, despite the fact that the phrase was never once uttered in the entire run) but brought back characters introduced in early episodes, and continued plots, and threads of plots from one episode to another.  I've been fan of many a sci-fi series (all the Star Treks, both Stargates, Battlestar Galactica, X-Files) and I am not exaggerating when I say that Firefly is better than all the others.    Now I curse the name of Fox and pray to any compassionate deity (or television executive) that will aid in the revival of this series.  As others have already stated, if 1900 reviews--95% of them positive--won't convince you, what will?

Souvenir -- another good song along the same lines as 'Politics'.  has a very \\"groovin'\\" feel with a nice, heavy pre-chorus/bridge.  5. 10 or a 2-Way -- now this is where it gets weird.  now, i love Korn, but this song is just awful.  i gave it a very decent few full listens until completely concluding that i can't stand this song.  it's very annoying at times and musically doesn't say anything.  this is what i was talking about when i said \\"too weird, too far\\" to the point of non-enjoyment.  this song makes 'Wish You Could Be Me' (from \\"Issues\\") seem as normal as 'Blind'.  6.  Throw Me Away -- deep, meaningful, powerful song.  very \\"Queen of the Damned\\" sounding.  not heavy but good, good, good.  7.  Love Song -- this one is really on the line as far as weirdness goes.  a few parts bug a little bit at first but after a couple listens, it is a strangely appealing song and not completely ruined by its weirder aspects (though just barely).  8.  Open Up -- another one like \\"10 or a 2-Way\\", just too out there.  the words are very meaningful (seemingly about their ex-member Brian \\"Head\\" Welch) and the chorus is cool, but the verses, bridge, and overall musical sound of the song ruin it all (for me at least).  9.  Coming Undone -- this is a cool, laid-back song.  the verses are very foot-tap-able and the chorus is hard not to sing along with.  10.  Getting Off -- this song represents how things can be different, but a hair away from too far.  the verses rock and very much represent Korn's awesome bi-polar feel.  also, you have to give David huge props on his totally energized drumwork.  awesome job.  11.  Liar -- wow.  when i heard this song, i said to myself, \\"That might have been the best Korn song ever made.\\"  i'll leave it at that.  12.  For No One -- another song that deserves big props to David's regenerated drumwork.  beyond that, just a generally good song.  13.  Seen It All -- no, no, no.  too far again.  it's a shame too, because the chorus is pretty catchy.  but catchy does not always mean good.  first off, i wasn't feeling Jon's almost-rapping in the verses and, again, the overall musical sound of the song was not enjoyable.  the bridge is, needless to say, very odd (though somewhat appealing in a David Bowie/Labyrinth type way).  but the song just made no impact for me.  14.  Tearjerker -- well, um... good if you're looking for a song to drift you to sleep, i suppose.  but if you are looking for a rockin' Korn song, don't look here.  the best way i can describe this song is Korn meets Britney Spears (most likely pushed forward by the former-pop producers of the CD--though Jon isn't quite as nasaly as Spears), i'm sorry, but i'm being honest.  but i will give Jon this much, he has a very soothing and beautiful voice.  that much is for sure.  but the avid headbanger will not enjoy this song.    Bonus Songs  1.  It's Me Again -- holy bajesus.  can we say \\"Korn has never been so heavy\\"?  this song, in all honesty, rivals such gnarly bands as Soulfly and Chimaira (I'd say Slipknot too, but they do not qualify as anything like metal since Vol. 3).  2.  Eaten Up Inside -- incredible song.  this is a work of genius.  one of the best pre-chorus' and chorus' ever.  and wow, the drums in thebridge.  go David.  3.  Last Legal Drug (Le Petit Mort) -- a good show of where electronics can be used effectively and enjoyably.  nice, nice song.  meaningful too.  another one of those songs that it is hard not to sing along with.  4.--5.  Twisted Transistor remixes -- yeah, let's not even go there.  6.  Appears (need to download it) -- another good, rockin' song.  great drumwork and catchy vocals.       So there's my review of each song.  Now, here is my advice to you on how to fully enjoy this latest Korn album and I REALLY advise you to take it.       Buy the Deluxe version of the CD, listen to all of it fully if you wish, then mix and burn of copy of the CD with 'Appears' replacing '10 or a 2-Way' (You'll have to download 'Appears' and figure out your own way of having is so you don't need internet connection to play it, otherwise just omit '10 or a 2-Way', trust me), 'Eaten Up Inside' replacing 'Open Up', 'It's Me Again' replacing 'Seen it All', and 'Last Legal Drug (Le Petit Mort)' replacing 'Tearjerker'.      I did this and enjoy the CD so much more now.  Korn made all the right and awesome songs for the CD, but--in my strong opinion--chose the wrong ones for the tracklisting.  The way that I compiled it above is the way I believe it should have been.  It's the most enjoyable and I hope you agree.       Great job to Korn, though.  The experimenting was good, as it showed both how far they can go to make good songs and how far they can go to make not-so-good songs.  They still get 5 stars, though, because the good songs are rediculously awesome and make this one of the best Korn CD's ever.
B000B7BRMM|5.0|I knew the idea of Diana Krall making a Christmas album could never go wrong -- and it didn't! This is a 'Swonderful holiday CD to be snowed in beside your lover with. As always the piano takes center bear rug to the performances, with rich warm strings fireplaced throughout, and even some playful horns mistletoeing on a few tracks. This is not Diana at her grandest or her most forceful -- it's Ms. Krall doing sweet and smooth and happy like only she can. There is even one song frosted with Diana's giggles as she mixes it up with the band. If you're looking for a Christmas album that feels like a comfortable sweater and smells like the perfume of your sweetheart then this is the CD for you. I could see Santa after all the toys have been delivered. kicking off his boots, pouring himself a nice glass of milk, snuggling with the Mrs., and chilling to Diana Krall's Christmas Songs.
B000084T18|3.0|Now, i am no fan of 50 cent, believe me - but Get Rich actually shows he has, however little, some talent. If you consider The Massacre, this will seem like a classic. <br /> <br />The album starts with a coin hitting the floor, and a gun being loaded (Intro), which pretty much somes up Fiddys forte. Guns and cash. timing at just under a minute is the follow up (What Up Gangsta), with an introduction to his life, pumped by a grimey beak, and half assed rhymes, with an annoying chorus... a very skippable track. (Patiently Waiting) gives some hope, with a better beat, backed up by Eminems vocals about halfway through the song. If you thought 50 had a great lyrically talent up to now, he seems to be outshined by his mentor. Yet another repetitive chorus, but overall a good track... <br /> <br />A skit to the next track, with bullets being fired, enters (Many Men), which 50 explains how he is headhunted by everyone. he drops lines like 'Im the underground king/ Who aint been Crowned' <br />and 'Like ali in his prime' - which is a bit to pretantious/obnoxious for me. The single that got overplayed on te radio (In Da Club) chimes next. if you havent heard this, you must be a tourist from neptune. 50 adds some humor to this catchy track, with some adrenaline pumped lyrics, but still doesnt capture the ears of mine fully. (High All The Time) explains itself - the drug track that can be found all over the G-Unit albums. But this subject has grown old, and the beat doesnt help. Pass. <br /> <br />A beat composed of gunshots, and lyrics remenicent of the gangsta-ish lyrics of the 90's actually works for 'half a dollar' on (Heat), probably the most replayable track on GRODT... with a mildly funny skit at the beggining, and some ad libbing at the end - which dont add, but tie up the seventh track on this LP. (If I Cant) posesses a diffrent kind of rhythm, sounding more like it could be on The Massacre. im not saying its a bad song, just average and samey, with a chorus: 'if i cant - do it homey - it cant be done - now ima let the champagne bottle pop - ima take ya to the top - fo sho ima make ya hot baby' and more 'g unit mentions' that would make you think the CD was skipping at sometimes... <br /> <br />(Blood Hound) features an appearance from G Unit soldier- YoungBuck, whose album i prefer to this one. He adds nothing to this song though, with poor rhyming and lack in skill. And whats with he 'Woof' in the backround? Shut that sh*t up! Check the chorus for a sum up to fiftys lifestyle. with the hit and miss tracklist, we close into the last part of the album, with a diss to Ja Rule (Back Down). But this is no Ether, and you've probably read the same thing in a magazine article. It ends with someone, posing as a homosexual boyfriend of Ja trying to be funny, and failing after the first listen. The next track has one of the best beats on the CD, but suprisingly, was not by Em or Dre. i think it was kuniva of D12, but cant remember right now anyway. anyways, (P.I.M.P) is 50 showing that he does not need the stereotypical Perm or Cadillac to be a pimp. while this song does offer some enjoyment, and an average video, it does what In Da Club does, and wears out,to noones fault but the radio and MTV. <br /> <br />From what i have heard, Tony Yayos (G unit ex-incarcerated member) album does not do anything for him, so i wont even bother listening to it, but he features on the next track (Like My Style) if only for a little amount of time - carlessly not showing the rap prowess he could have. (Poor Lil Rich) is one of the dullest tracks on the album, which is a shame as the last three tracks are actually quite good.  <br /> <br />They are (21 Questions) which has an appearance from the master of hooks - Nate Dogg. the beat on the track does sound similar to P.I.M.P but then again, that isnt a bad thing. And finnaly, 50 cent stirs away from the gangbanging-gunslinging attitude splattered on all the other tracks to make a mellowish track which isone of my faveroutes on the album, giving relief from the grime you just expiereinced of the last however many minutes.  To finish up the G-unit features, is Lloyd Banks, and a return from slim shady for (Dont Push Me), an even darker track than most of the rest, and you can hear Lloyd in the backround of the line - 'So Dont Push Me' in the chorus. Now this is the best verse from the G-Unit lot, proving Banks has something to show for himself, outshining his homie, But then Eminem finishes off with an outstanding verse proving he still has it, apart from his 'Oh/No/Yo/Ho' line which ruins it a bit. Still, this song is great, and worth the listen. The album ends with (Gotta Make It To Heaven) - another boring track which should have been left out of the album. <br /> <br />In short - only about 7 tracks desereved to be put on this album, an average effort from what would become the most Ovverated rapper ever. 50's good, but nothing special. Peace <br /> <br />Hadi
B000062X9B|5.0|Truly the best album of the 4 American Recordings albums. Cash's versions of SOLITARY MAN, ONE or THAT LUCKY OLD SUN among others are incredible. It's not as touching as THE MAN COMES AROUND album because that was the last one but SOLITARY MAN is, on the music level, the best one. The songs that were picked are really good choices and Cash delivers amazing versions.<br /><br />Truly the high point of his late comeback albums.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|This movie in case you didn't know, follows up after Final Fantasy 7, the greatest game of that franchise and one of the best RPG's ever(or at least I'm told, I dont own a single Sony product so I really missed out). <br /> <br />I happened to love this movie, despite being totally oblivious to what's going on. I happen to be computer animator myself(not as a job because I'm 17, but for school and for kicks). I know how friggin hard it is to get stuff to look move and act like that. Let's just say the Pixar folks take the easy out of a lot of things... These guys (whoever they are)seem to have taken every step possible to make you second guess your eyes, and that causes the jaw dropping and gorgeous part. the converting part came when I started to pay attention to the movie and releasized that that Final Fantasy is not just a franchise for fanboys, but it actually has some good merits to it. I may actually go buy a playstation and a copy of the game because of this... who knows?
B000BOH8XW|4.0|Shakira is one crazy chick. I came across this album playing in my friend's room, and i listened to some greogorian church music playing in the background... followed by... rock! Weirrdd...    But i was mesmerised. At first, only a few other songs (besides 'Don't Bother') got my attention - Animal City (which combined guitar riffs and jungle noises!!) and Timor (dance synths & a childrens choir).   They were the upbeat songs. Oh & 'HEy You'!!~ a really cute song.    But on second listen, when i actually listened to all the songs to their entirety, listening to the words & the composition of the songs... the other (slower) songs really got me.  I hadn't really listen to them because - admit it - u wouldn't really expect shakira to have anything to say... but you've gotta listen 2 this album!! She has more insight than ud expect, and with each song she seems to become more in touch with herself and the world.   And maybe its because English is her 2nd language... but her lyrics really play on the language & are really quite intelligent and intriguing.    But what really comes across in this album is shakira's real quirkiness - she's truly bonkers!! The weird music combinations leave u slightly perplexed at first but with each listen, become more compelling & u start to wonder where she'll be heading next, musically.    I'm sure she could've released another Laundry Service with her record company & guaranteed herself chart success but instead she opts for something else - something more deep & raw... almost primitive....but in a good sense.  With this album it feels as though she's just curiously wandered off into a new musical path...  And i don't know why, but I can't seem to stop playing this album... its just so raw & real - it's just such a refreshing album!
0553804367|5.0|+++++<br /><br />\\"In this book are lucid revelations on the frontiers of physics, astronomy, cosmology [the study of the universe as a whole], and courage [Dr. Stephen Hawking has ALS, also called Lou Gehrig's disease or motor neuron disease contracted when he was young and now is wheelchair bound].  This is also a book about God...or perhaps about the absence of God.  The word God fills these pages.  Hawking embarks on a quest to answer Einstein's famous question about whether God had any choice in creating the universe.  Hawking is attempting, as he explicitly states, to understand the mind of God.  And this makes all the more unexpected the conclusion of the effort, at least so far: a universe with no edge in space, no beginning or end in time, and nothing for a Creator to do.\\"<br /><br />These are the words in the last paragraph of the introduction to Hawking's very first or original book \\"A Brief History of Time\\" (1988).  These words were written by the late, great Dr. Carl Sagan.  (In his introduction, Sagan calls Hawking a \\"legend.\\")<br /><br />Nothing has changed with this new book with respect to what Sagan says above.  But as a reader of Hawking's first book, I did notice welcome changes.<br /><br />First, this new book is more concise.  This does not mean this book is drastically shorter than the original.  This new book is about twenty pages less than the original.  Also this new book contains one more chapter than the original!  What this book does is cut out extraneous technical detail from the original and focuses only on the most important concepts but still maintains the essence of the original.  Thus, the book seems much more concise.<br /><br />Next, and this is very important, this book is more accessible.  The important concepts mentioned above, I found, are explained much more clearly thus increasing this book's readability in order to achieve Hawking's (and collaborator Leonard  Mlodinow's) goal: \\"to share some of the excitement of...[scientific] discoveries, and the new picture of reality that is emerging as a result.\\"<br /><br />Third, this book is illustrated throughout with color illustrations.  Actually, the original book was also illustrated but the new illustrations are, I feel, more easier to grasp.  (I only have a complaint with the first illustration in this new book because it doesn't illustrate the point it's trying to make.)<br /><br />Finally, this book is actually updated with respect to the latest theoretical and observational results!  For example, this book describes recent progress that's been made in finding a complete unified theory of all the forces of physics and describes the progress made in string theory (technically called superstring theory).  Observational material comes from the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) satellite and by the Hubble Space Telescope.  Thus, even though I read the original book, I still learned much from this book.<br /><br />As with the original book, this book contains a helpful glossary and an appendix briefly outlining the lives of Albert Einstein (1879 to 1955), Galileo (1564 to 1642), and Sir Isaac Newton (1642 to 1727). (Notice that Newton was born in the same year Galileo died.  Hawking was born in 1942, three hundred years after the death of Galileo.)<br /><br />Here are the names of the chapter titles:<br /><br />(1) Thinking about the universe.<br /><br />(2) Our evolving picture of the universe (Discussion of Galileo starts here.)<br /><br />(3) The nature of scientific theory.<br /><br />(4) Newton's universe.<br /><br />(5) Relativity. (Discussion of Einstein starts here.)<br /><br />(6) Curved space.<br /><br />(7) The expanding universe.<br /><br />(8) The Big Bang, black holes, and the evolution of the universe.  (It is thought that the Big Bang is how the universe began.  A black hole is a region of space or more correctly space-time, where nothing, not even light can escape, because gravity is so strong.)<br /><br />(9) Quantum Gravity.  (This is a theory that merges quantum mechanics that is a theory that deals with the very small with general relativity that is a theory of the very large and that incorporates gravity.)<br /><br />(10) Wormholes and time travel. (A wormhole is theoretically a thin tube of space or space-time connecting distant regions of the universe.)<br /><br />(11) The forces of nature and the unification of gravity.  (The forces of nature are electromagnetism, the weak force of radioactivity, the strong force that binds the atomic nucleus together, and gravity.  The first three forces can be combined or unified but gravity seems to stand on its own.)<br /><br />(12) Conclusion.  (Last words in this chapter: \\"then we would know the mind of God.\\")<br /><br />Finally, this book is not referenced.  However since Hawking is Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge University, a post once held by Newton and Sagan witnessed his accepting this position in 1974, I think I can safely take Hawking at his word.<br /><br />In conclusion, this book is a reorganized version of a science classic that is now more accessible, more concise, better illustrated, and updated with the latest research.  It is not to be missed!!<br /><br />(first published 2005;  acknowledgements;  forward;  12 chapters;  main narrative 160 pages; appendix;  glossary;  index)<br /><br />+++++y.

0743454537|4.0|I've read several Jodi Picoult novels and I think she has a great talent for story-telling. Her writing is rich without being overdone, and she usually centers her stories on difficult and provocative issues that make you really think about the choices the characters are making. MY SISTER'S KEEPER is a great story, filled with very believable and understandable characters with a heart-breaking ethical dilemma at its core. The novel treats all of the characters with respect and really forces you to think about what you would do in their shoes, and how that answer would be different based on each character. <br /> <br />I was ready to give this book 5 stars until I read the last few pages. I agree with other reviewers that the ending was just terrible, creating a real feeling of dissonance with the rest of the story. I wish it had ended before that last chapter, because then I could've said I really loved this book.
B00001QEE7|4.0|The Little Mermaid is without a doubt a timeless classic. In my opinion it's the best modern Disney work since Snow White, Cinderella, and Sleeping Beauty. Character development, plotline, visuals, vocals...everything is superb! Plus unforgettable songs like \\"Under the Sea\\", \\"Kiss the Girl\\", and my favorite \\"Part of Your World\\". <br /> <br />I rated this item with 4 stars and not 5 because the Limited Edition DVD has very little special features... by little I mean almost none. If you can wait for the Platinum Edition, then I'd suggest you wait. I couldn't wait so that is why I got this edition.
B00004RF97|4.0|The first half hour of this movie might have you thinking that it will be a formulaic farce, but it quickly turns into a an interestingly off-balance look at the tension between societal expectations and true love, succeeding both as a light-hearted comedy and a serious commentary on the ultimate irrelevance of economic classes in the pursuit of love.   <br />     With lesser actors, the script might have turned into something heavy-handed and forced, but Hepburn, Stewart, and Hussey do a wonderful job of revealing vulnerabilities in their characters, something that transforms the action from soap opera to something special.  Cary Grant performs admirably in his role as the once-favored of Hepburn, but his role lacks the emotional range of the roles that Hepburn and Stewart played.  That aside, the acting is consistently great and quite moving, though 21st century sensibilities might find it a little too emotive.  The work of the young Virginia Weidler, who would die too young in 1968 of a heart ailment, is just one among many other hidden gems in this film.  <br /> <br />Please watch this film if you'd like an idea of what \\"romantic comedy\\" meant in the US at the dawn of WWII.
B000BP86OG|3.0|The Darkness have a fun, and exciting sound that has some power. It can put you in higher spirits. Stuff like that was more of the norm in the 80's, as you know and its great.<br /><br /> Im glad TheDarkness came out, rock music needed them.<br /><br /> This new cd by the band is not bad , it just doesnt give me much goosebumbs or that chill up my spine, it does a little though.<br /><br /> The first song \\" One way ticket \\" is catchy and carries that power rock sound thats so great. Its a good opener to the album,<br /><br />If theres one song to get the album for, its this one.<br /><br /> Track 6 \\" Hazel Eyes \\" is probubly the secondary hit on the cd.<br /><br />The guitars you hear at the songs start have a nice Brain May (lead guitarist of Queen) influence to them and from there on you have to hear the song for yourself , becouse its kinda of hard to describe. It makes me think of a big pirate ship on the seas of the Orient, accompanied by a bagpipe somewhere in the background. Ya...weird.<br /><br />The third song thats sorta a hit is track 8, \\"Girlfriend\\"; but its nothing really amazing, might come across annoying.<br /><br />Other songs on this cd reminded me ALITTLE of the band Boston , while it pays more tribute to Queen, which is cool, becouse i love QUEEN. Freddie Mercury, of Queen, is my favorite singer, and greatest inspiration for singing, personally.<br /><br /> Anyways,i've thought about selling this album, cuz i was a bit dissapointed after hearing it , but i might keep it.<br /><br />Though i doubt it.<br /><br /> Even if i probubly would of been better off downloading the songs i liked on this cd for free, its not a bad cd, it has a unique sound that is pretty much all its own... atleast compared to the current rock music played on the radio.<br /><br /> Unless you've previewed this cd and really liked a lot of the songs, be cautious before buying, try to find a really good bargain price.<br /><br />It does have sweet cd cover art. But im not sure if id pay $14.99 for that. The art, the name of the cd and down to the name of the band MIGHT give you the false impression that you're going to get an ass kicking , but dont be misled.<br /><br /> The rest of the songs on the album are produced pretty good i think, like the song \\"Blind Man\\", track 10, the last song.  And the song \\"English Country Garden\\" is allright, but nothing really amazing at all.<br /><br />All the same, i thank TheDarkness for bringing the guitar solos and good spirits.<br /><br />Still, i'll give this cd a few more listens.<br /><br />Cheerio!. But im not sure if id pay $14.99 for that. The art, the name of the cd and down to the name of the band MIGHT give you the false impression that you're going to get an ass kicking , but dont be misled.  <br /> <br /> The rest of the songs on the album are produced pretty good i think, like the song \\"Blind Man\\", track 10, the last song.

0385335989|3.0|After my first reading of this book, I really disliked Jamie for his ultra-violent streak. On my second reading, I'm still bothered some by it. This time around I found myself, instead, actively hating Brianna. She behaves like a spoilt biotch and treats Roger like absolute crap. Roger has risked his life for her repeatedly and we come to find out she \\"isn't sure\\" she wants to be with him? I for one wouldn't have sat in the circle for three days. I'd be OUTTA THERE.    Diana Gabaldon obviously paints her characters vividly enough that you can develop real feelings toward them, negative or not-and you might surprise yourself on your second (or third or fourth!) reading of the series. These characters (these people?)feel like family and friends.      Due to its graphic violence and often disturbing subject matter, I am still very hesitant to recommend the series to certain people. After all, they might cause a heart attack in anyone who's been on a steady diet of Harlequin-type romance books.     On to the Fiery Cross!
B00070DK5K|5.0|I cannot believe that anyone who claims to be a fan of rock-n-roll, let alone a Bowie fan, could listen to this album and say anything other than, \\"It kicks ass\\".  I came of age listening to Bowie and can remember sneaking into my brothers room to listen to \\"Ziggy Stardust\\" to which I played air-guitar, et al.  This album, \\"Live\\" is Bowie's talents fused with many great individual talents, ie. Slick, Sanborn, Flowers and Mike Garson to create a supergroup which, as I previously exclaimed, \\"Kicked ass\\".  Sanborn going on to create that signature intro to \\"Saturday Night Live\\", Slick continued with David working with him and Carlos Alomar, resulting in one of David's finest recordings, STATIONTOSTATION, not to mention John Lennon's \\"Double Fantasy\\", later forming Phantom, Rocker & Slick.  And Herbie Flowers who moved on to Frank Zappa.  Anyone recall \\"Overnight Sensation\\"? Please, DO NOT tell me this in not a Tour de Force in the Bowie catalogue.   <br />Just to listen to Herbie on \\"Width of a Circle\\".  Tony Visconti would have been proud and hard pressed to say Herbie does not recreate the excitement of \\"The Man Who Sold the World\\". \\"Who's Tony Visconti?\\"  Then, listen to Slick and Sanborn duel on \\"Sweet Thing\\" or Michael Garson on \\"Aladdin Sane\\", who also covered the original on the album of the same name.   <br />That said, I challenge the musical credentials of ANYONE who listens to this recording and does not see how fortunate we are to have this available to us to listen to \\"...until the grooves grow old.\\"
B000AL730O|5.0|This album is one of his best in the last 10 years. A must have.
0767812387|5.0|I love a good dance movie and this is one for the collection.  This dvd sells for about $7.00 at thiat price it is a very good buy.
B000002H4Q|5.0|The Cure has really out done themselves. They have given you everything you could have asked,begged and demanded from their style of music. Fast, slow,loud and soft.A little recycling from the other albums but new material that just makes you fall in love with them all over again. The emotion exerted for Robert Smith makes you wonder if he really is happy because you swear he is being tortured in life after all he gives. Love this album, and never leave it alone because it will surely be gone.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I still don't understand why I only just saw one episode of Firefly when it was on the air.  Dumbest thing I ever did.  I guess I kinda assumed it would be around and I'd get to it later when it was in reruns.  Well, we all know how that went. :(  When the movie came out, I had fellow sci-fi geeks--er, fans--tell me that I HAD to go see this--that it was SOOOOO incredibly good.  Well I hemmed and hawed but went to go see it and like so many here, absolutely fell in love with it.  Saw it again the very next week.  In my opinion, it was taken out of theatres way too soon.    Well I just had to figure out a way to get some more somehow so my friends told me that the series had been released on DVD, so I got them from the library and did a (nearly) marathon watching party. Well I am now officially addicted to Firefly so I must buy this now.  It's absolutely worth having as part of my permanent collection and I simply don't collect series, not even any of the Star Trek series.  The movie was everthing Star Wars III should have been.  I fully expect to see more of Serenity and her crew in some form or fashion in the future.    Browncoats need to make some noise and get 'er done!

B000B8QF14|4.0|Green Day's newest release the cd/dvd combo \\"Bullet in A Bible\\" comes after their highly successful American Idiot album and tour. The cd/dvd was recorded over two nights in England. Bullet in a Bible is a fine cd and dvd. Half the songs that comprise the cd are taken from American Idiot, leaving only seven tracks to represent Green Day's other albums. While perhaps a double cd set would have been better, and certainly could have covered more ground. Bullet in a Bible is quite an enjoyable release. The cd is perferable to the dvd, mainly because on the dvd the flow is interrupted by interviews between everysong. It would have been better to save the interviews for after the concert material, but still this is a good release.
B000BZ99WY|5.0|It's almost fitting that the task of reviewing, and therefore reading, Shake Hands with the Devil, Rom&eacute;o Dallaire's wrenching first-hand account of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, was a task studiously avoided by many of us around the offices of ascent. Fitting, as it mirrors in a microcosm how Dallaire's cries for help were also largely ignored at the time by the West.<br /><br />Shake Hands with the Devil is a haunted survivor's attempt to assess responsibility in \\"the failure of humanity in Rwanda,\\" wherein 800,000 people were massacred over a period of 100 days. Dallaire's point is not merely to point fingers, but rather to learn where mistakes were made so that future interventions by the world community into conflicts might render these intercessions more facile.<br /><br />While highly emotional, this book is also fair and balanced in its criticism, never confusing true emotion with sentimentality. One example is Dallaire's criticism of the Belgian government, which has a long and shameful colonial history in Rwanda. Although the Belgians lost ten soldiers in a massacre, Dallaire doesn't allow that tragedy to temper his disapproval of their behaviour during the genocide. In fact, no one escapes Dallaire's just criticism, from United Nations and world leaders arguing semantics over UN decrees while hundreds of thousands of people were being slaughtered, to US army assessors' macabre accounting that the life of one US soldier was valued equal to the lives of 80,000 Rwandans, and of course, the perpetrators of the genocide themselves - the normal people who just woke up one morning and joined in the killing of their former neighbours.<br /><br />Shake Hands with the Devil is a great guttural wail of humanity coming from one who has witnessed its worst possible behaviour. It is telling that while Dallaire paints his account of the atrocities in broad strokes, he reserves more detailed accounts to quoting other observers: his second-in-command, UNHCR commanders and other NGO workers. It is as if he himself cannot find a voice to speak of things that no one should ever see.<br /><br />Ultimately, this book stands as Rom&eacute;o Dallaire's confession and self-indictment. This seeming paradox of a man - a career soldier who is a gentle, eloquent spokesman for peace - still cannot forgive himself for what he sees as his failure in being unable to stop the killing a decade ago. The horrors witnessed in Rwanda, coupled with the impotence of his UN mandate and scarce resources of an ill-equipped force of only 500, have left this brave man scarred, prematurely aged, forced into early retirement from post-traumatic stress syndrome, and a survivor of multiple suicide attempts.<br /><br />This book filled me with an overpowering moral outrage, but ultimately it allows a small glimpse of hope. The survivors of the Rwandan genocide have attempted to rebuild their country with a non-partisan government not based upon ethnic lines. Rom&eacute;o Dallaire came back from the edge of hell with hope that the new century will be what he calls the \\"century of humanity.\\" Where human beings will rise above violence, while recognizing that the poverty that leaves much of the world without hope is the source of most violent conflict and therefore must be eliminated to help bring peace. Dallaire believes that we can rise above notions of race that led Hutu to kill Tutsi - notions that raise the question of whether Western nations would have stood by while a nation of non-Africans were slaughtered en masse.<br /><br />In all this uncertainty, Rom&eacute;o Dallaire is still able to entertain these hopes, and the fact that a hardened, former high-level military leader who has witnessed the ultimate savage potential of human beings can still have faith in mankind helped restore my own hope for humanity, flawed as we are.rs.

B0002DB0FO|5.0|I lived in the Netherlands in 2003 when the Dutch TV network started airing the series.  I left the country to return to the U.S. just as season #3 finished airing there.  I was left with the cliffhanger episode of whether or not Colin survived the second surgery. After a decade of living in Europe and enjoying the small amount of commercials compared to the insanity of the U.S. TV networks, I decided not to have any TV upon my return -- my TV is only a monitor to play videos of my choosing.  One of my only regrets about this decision is that I have never been able to see Everwood again, one of the most memorable viewing experiences I had while I still watched any kind of network TV (albeit foreign network).  When I saw that Season I of Everwood was available, I snapped it up and had watched 3 episodes the first night, having to stop myself from watching more.  My boyfriend and I started watching episodes every night, revelling in not having to endure commercial breaks, and becoming immersed in the well-formed and well-acted characters and storylines.  Alas, we finished all the DVDs within a week!  You'll laugh, cry and be thoroughly entertained with the Everwood populace on this amazingly well-written and beautifully-produced series.  The DVD set has some wonderful extras as well.  I was only left wishing there had been more than 4 episodes with a commentary track.  The amazing irony about this gem of a TV series, as explained on one of the extra featurettes, is that it is deliberately a \\"small\\" series, which allows it to be as rich as it is in its storytelling.  If it were more popular, it would be forced to cater more to sponsors and network mandates, and thus lose its brilliance.  Says alot about mainstream American TV, doesn't it?   <br />I am currently signed up to be notified as soon as Series 2 is available on DVD because I've been waiting a LONG time to see if Colin survived that second surgery :-)  And while I'm at it, how about gearing up to make Series 3available as well!
0060825219|5.0|I have not been so moved by a book since I was thirteen and read The Little Prince for the first time.For me The Zahir was about all of life and I felt it deep in my soul.Listening to the audio version takes you away like a dream.
B0007LCNKM|5.0|I bought this record on the strength of various message boards on the net thinking that the masses could not possibly be wrong. I was right. This might be the best record released in 2005. From the beginning insecurities of SECRET MEETING, to the final promising cries of MR NOVEMBER, this is a moody, brooding masterpiece. It is a gem that is waiting to be discovered by someone willing to surrender to the brilliance of John Berninger & Co.<br /><br />What I find stands out most apart from the obvious drum engine driving this record forward is the amazing lyrics sung by such an amazing voice. They evoke such imagery very much like Antony and the Johnsons.... self-defeat but tinged with a sense of hope that things will be fine in the end. I also really appreciate how they use the piano in most of the songs. As a piano player myself, I like it when the piano is in the forefront but here they use it so sparingly yet it is so effective. You have to hear KAREN and DAUGHTERS OF THE SOHO RIOTS to know what I am talking about and why I needed to mention it.<br /><br />Now I don't want you to think this record will put you to sleep because there are full-throttle rock numbers on here.... LIT UP and ABEL to name a couple. It's all good. Although I can hear early U2 influences along with the other references listed in the previous reviews, they are really their own sound. All I can say is if you feel your record collection is missing that special CD of 2005, congrats... you found it. Now buy it!
B00009V7P8|5.0|Now, i am something of a music addict. and no i am not just saying that. i spend a lot of my time here looking for new music, buying and downloading new albums, and listening to it with my friends. i like all kinds, inclduing rock, punk, folk, rap. pretty much everything. and this is seriously one of my favorite albums of all time <br /> <br />here is why. damien rice and his lady accomplice have created a beautiful and expansively breathtaking set of songs here, especially for a debut. Both of their voices, particularly his, are breathtaking, and the variation of instruments used will leave you astounded that there are only two people in this group.  <br /> <br />the album starts out calm with the aptly titled Delicate. right away you see the kind of album you are getting into it. it is easy to put something like this in folk, but it is a much bigger sound than folk. volcano is a reasonably popular song, and is a easy to listen to duet between the two members. The Blower's Daughter...where do i begin? From the first few seconds it is breathtaking. It is well written lyrically, and the cello on this song seems to strike every chord of my body. then when he repeats \\"I can't take my eyes off of you\\" over and over again, it is with a somber desperation in which he does it. the first time i heard it i found myself breathing heavier with the same desperation as he is singing. blower's daughter blends seamlessly into Cannonball, a song of longing and devotion that rivals most. now keep in mind that while most of these songs discuss relationships and love, it has none of the mopey and wimpy characteristics that many untalented band nowadays see as a staple. it is true heartfelt folk songs  <br /> <br />Older Chests is probbaly the folkiest of the songs. simple acoustic guitar and damien's voice. very effective with the bittersweet lyrics provided. Amie is a string wet dream. The first portion of the song isn't overly extraordinary, but has some of the most beautiful sections of the album in it. In the second part, however, it is a ceaselessly blending and fluctuating combination of what sounds like violins, cellos, violas, among others. it is gorgeous. Cheer's Darlin', while being a good song, seems almost lowly compared to the first 6 songs of the album. definitely worth a listen, though. cold water is a delicate piano driven song, that after careful listening just might be the best song on the album <br /> <br />i remember is kind of an oddball on this album. it replaces the produced soft sound of the rest of the album with a raw, scraping duet between the two singers, especially when damien screams \\"come all ye reborn blow off my horn, i'm driving it hard, this is love, this is porn.\\" he seems on the verge of breakdown, and it is a different, but not unwelcome, change in emotional tactic for the album. Eskimo is the epic, yet somewhat overdone finale to the album. it starts off well enough, but when they start blending in collossal sounds and an opera singer, you know this song is different. a beautiful song, but unlike the rest in many ways <br /> <br />this album with its 10 songs will change the way you think of certain things. rice's delcate voice, along with the impressive musicianship with a wide range of instruments, carry a truly amazing album that has been grossly overlooked and is truly one of the masterpieces of the past few years
B000002KO3|5.0|By the time Remain In Light was released, Talking Heads had already made some kind of name for themselves.  After emerging from the club scene with hits like Psycho Killer in 1977, they continually matured and expanded their sonic signature with pieces like I Zimbra from Fear of Music. <br /> <br />For this record they worked closely with Brian Eno.  His influence is unmistakeable.  The mesh between the Heads' quirky lyrics and catchy melodies and Eno's rich tapestry of tape loops and electronic sounds works brilliantly.  Oddly enough (or perhaps not odd) is that the one well known song from this record (Once In A Lifetime) sticks out as a bit of a sore thumb from the rest of the tracks. <br /> <br />This album truly signals the Heads' apex of achievement for originality and creativity.  This is not to say they failed to progress beyond this point, but they would never again reach this level of artistic accomplishment.
B0007Y4USW|5.0|<br />Artist: Mariah Carey <br />Style: R&B and Hip-hop <br />Album: The Emancipation of Mimi <br />Label and Release Date: Long Island / April 12, 2005, Reissue released November 15, 2005 <br />Price: 10.99 <br />Number of Copies Sold: 150 million <br /> <br /> Her existing new album The Emancipation of Mimi has a great beat and her voice has so much passion. She sings about love and loss, as demonstrated by one of the songs, \\"We Belong Together,\\" with lyric: \\"When you left I lost a part of me, it's just so hard to believe, come back baby please, cause we belong together baby.\\" <br /> <br />She came from, Long Island, New York. In 1972 Mariah's mother, Patricia discovered Mariah's talent while rehearsing at home from New York City Opera debut as Magdalena in Verdi's Rigoletto. As a tiny girl Mariah sang true pitch; she was able to hear sound and duplicate it exactly. Mariah never missed her cue. She could also sing in Italian and she wasn't even three years old yet. From then on Patricia began coaching Mariah.    <br />She attended Greenlawn's Harbor fields High School. She was in her junior year of high school, she started to write her own songs. When she was 18 years old, she moved to New York City where she was a back up singer for Brenda K. Starr, a break that led to signing with Columbia Records. Mariah is also a writer and a producer. Her singing career started at the age of 20 years old.  <br /> <br />At the age of 20, Mariah Carey went to college at the University of Nebraska Lincoln College of Journalism. She also went to an all women's college; the chorus teachers really loved her voice and were sad to see her go. Mariah graduated college in April 29, 2004 with a degree in BCT. She owns a three-floor apartment in New York City. Mariah signed a $100,000,000 million deal with Virgin Records for her next four albums [2001]. She has done 16 number one hits already, they are Glitter (2001) and film [January 26, 2002] $100 million contract for $28 million. She's in the film WiseGirl (2002) on HBO [May 2002] 21-24 million. Some of Mariah's CDs are; MTV Unplugged, Music Box, Marry Christmas, Daydream, Butterfly, #1's, Rainbow, Greatest Hits, Charmbracelet, The Remixes, Mariah Carey, Emotions, The Emancipation of Mimi. The CD called, The Emancipation of Mimi came out in 2005. When Mariah was first starting her singing career, life has very hard for her.     <br />Even now, she is the hottest number one popular female singer on the charts; she is also bigger then the Beatles and Elvis Presley, which I can't believe. Currently Mariah is making more cds, making more films, and going to the Grammy awards; she has won 50 Grammy's for her music and films. Her songs are different because she likes to try new and fresh things. Mariah has a controlling influence on the power of other people. In all of her songs, she has a great beat. She has incredible talent in her songs and in her voice, she can also sings gospel like \\"Fly Like a Bird\\" and \\"Stay The Night,\\" Mariah and James both have co-written and co-produced three songs called, \\"I Wish You Know,\\" Circle,\\" and \\"Fly Like a Bird.\\" The song called \\"To the Floor\\" featuring Nelly in it.  <br /> <br />Within the music charts, Mariah Carey is number one, which is really impressive. <br />Mariah has some personal quotes, which are evident in her songs. <br />I heard the song \\"Hero\\" and realized that after all I can be my own hero; like I have done something good with my life, like her music. \\"This is for all of you out there tonight, reaching for a dream - don't ever give up! Never ever listen to anyone, when they try to discourage you, because they do that, believe me!\\" (Madison Square Garden, 1995). \\"A lot of times they (the media) form the idea in listeners' minds. Calling me a `pop diva' without listening to my work, so when I come out with an urban song that like, `pop diva goes black.' I mean, pur-lease.\\"  - Mariah from Hip Hop magazine, \\"Butterflies are following me, everywhere Igo.\\"                                      <br />The CD meaning for the name called, The Emancipation of Mimi means setting herself free; Mimi also can mean \\"child\\" in Spanish. \\"This is the record I have always wanted to make.\\" Emancipation is the first collection of original songs Carey has delivered since 2002's tepidly received Charmbracelet. Typical of Carey's music, the album is packed with power ballads and club-banging collaborations with hip-hop heavyweights such as Nelly, Snoop Dogg, the Neptures, Kanye West, Twista, and Jermaine Dupri. Carey has always written her own songs, including those on her first demo, which she famously slipped to future Sony Entertainment CEO Tommy Mottola at a party when she was18, of course, became her mentor and husband, and her career soared. This time around, she spends a year and a half composing Emancipation during the late nights at her downtown New York penthouse, cribs episode on MTV. ([...])       <br /> <br />When listening to Mariah Carey's new cd called, The Emancipation of Mimi, I want to dance. One of my favorite songs of her's is, \\"We Belong Together\\" which is a beautiful song with a great beat! Mariah sings about a love that she no longer has; she is so beautiful, and she has all the right songs for what kind of mood I am in. She is one of my favorite singers in my whole collection of CDs. I love how her voice sounds and how her voice can go very high up, I love singing with her, I love being in chorus because it makes me feel more alive inside, I am a high soprano. The words that she used in her music are so beautiful that it can make some people feel all- emotional. <br /> In this CD, the song called, \\"Shake It Off\\" is hip-hop, and it has a great beat! I don't know why but that song always gets me into a good mood, and also helped me get over my boyfriends. So do yourself a major favor and get this CD, because it's worth it. <br /> <br />On This CD called,  The Emancipation of Mimi, she has 14 songs;  they are:\\"It's Like That,\\" \\"We Belong Together,\\" Shake It Off,\\" \\"Mine Again,\\" \\"Say Somethin',\\" \\"Stay The Night,\\" \\"Get Your Number,\\" \\"One And Only,\\" \\"Circles,\\" Your Girl,\\" \\"I Wish You Knew,\\" \\"To The Floor,\\" \\"Joy Ride,\\" and \\"Fly Like a Bird.\\" It depends on the kind of mood that I am in; if I am happy or mad, I like to listen to hip-hop music.  <br />If I am in a love or sad mood, I like to listen to slow music. I dislike \\"To The Floor\\" because of the beat and Nelly's voice. When I first heard her songs I started to dance to it, I bought the CD and then I learned the lyrics by heart. Mariah's music will evolve, because she likes to try new and fresh things. She is here to stay, people will continue to be her fan, and she will grow. If I had to give her a rating, I would give her an A+ because she is so good; I love her voice, with all of her passion, and the great beat of her music.          <br />     <br />    <br />                         <br />         <br />                                                                            <br />    <br /> <br /> <br />                                                                                <br />                                                                                       <br />                                                                                    <br /> <br />                                                                                                                     <br />
B00004XONN|5.0|Following their groundbreaking \\"OK Computer\\", Radiohead was poised to extend their revolutionary and unique stylings with a greatly expanded following.  From the opening notes of \\"Everything In Its Right Place\\", it is obvious they meant business.  Kid A stretches the boundaries beyond OK Computer at least as much as OK did from The Bends, if not more. <br /> <br />In many cases, electronic music seems cold and detached.  Radiohead has managed to meld their Floyd-esque, guitar-oriented musings with the electronic soundscape of, say, Kid A or Treefingers.  This mixture can be hard to swallow in pieces, but when taken as a whole, Kid A actually makes for a more soothing, enjoyable pill to swallow than OK Computer did.
076790592X|4.0|Tuesdays with Morrie <br /> <br />\\"Sometimes you cannot believe what you see; you have to believe what you feel. And if you ever going to have other people trust you, you must feel that you can trust them, too-even when you're in the dark. Even when you're falling.\\" \\"Mitch\\" (Albom 61) <br />Tuesdays with Morrie, by Mitch Albom, I give this book a rating of a four stars, because I thought the book was good but not great. The summary of the book has to do with Morrie's illness and how he copes with it. Ultimately, the strength of this book is that Mitch openly portrays Morrie's genuine attempt to live every day like it was his last. <br />The weakness of this book is how sad it is. This book appeals to all ages, because everyone contemplates the meaning of life from time to time.  <br /> <br />The strength of this book is; it was surprising how long Morrie held on to his life. This book can help other people cop with their illness and death. Mitch Albom wrote this book because Mitch wanted people to here Morrie's story, and how he looked at life differently. Mitch even leaned kindness from Morrie. <br />The weakness of this book is; was recording his conversation on a tope player that the student had with his old teacher. The poor, old man was dying and every week they met, Mitch would record his conversations. Morrie probably did not mind because he was a kind soul, but still it was kind of upsetting. Maybe Morrie would have shared more with us if his voice had not been recorded.          <br />The appeals of this book are, People are thinking about the true meaning of life. We should be thankful for being healthy and being close to our family. The simple pleasures of life it self are worth more then anything. Morrie's positive and comic attitude for dealing with the disease can help people have more optimistic way to cop with their own illness.    <br /> <br />The conclusion this book is, filled with so much emotion, love, and friendship it is just overall phenomena! People can relate to this book with their own lives. It was nice of Morrie to Mitch a different way to look at life. Mitch changed from worrying about his job to enjoying the finer things life has to offer. It is so awesome to see such a strong bound between a teacher and a student. Tuesdays with Morrie will most likely change its reader's way of life in one way or another. This book has taught me to forgive others for making poor dissensions, to look at life more differently, and to be happy for what I have because some people out there don't have anything.     <br />
B000B8QF14|4.0|I would recommend this to any fan of Green Day. The DVD was very good, but it could've been even better. The concert itself was great. The irritating \\"film it for an ADD person\\" approach to camera angles was anything BUT great. It bugged the bejesus out of me in Revenge of the Sith and it did not score any more points during Bullet in a Bible.  <br />    The CD part was.... well.... pretty much the DVD concert minus the documentary and the in-song banter. Ok, well the annoyingly frequent cries of \\"ENGLAND!\\" are still there... All in all this is a very good live package. It does have a \\"rough around the edges\\" vibe to it at points, but it is still a great addition to the Collection nevertheless.

B0009I7NNA|1.0|Simply a disgrace to metal. I never really was much of a fan of this band ever since their 1st album. But since seeing them on TRL. Has just brought them to my attention. SELLOUTS!!! The guy can't scream anymore all the guitar riffs and solos sound the same. This album is going to bring a lot of destruction for metal bands. People who were never interested in metal at all. Will simply jump on the band wagon and embrace this band. Next thing they will be touring with Backstreet Boys. This kind of metal is just like the NU-Metal. Most bands will break up and go out. Very few will be remaining after all is said and done. A lot of people compare Avenged and Atreyu. But at least Atreyu isn't on TRL. And they are better.   <br /> <br /> All true metal fans stay clear of this one!
0684857219|4.0|Very good book dont get me wrong but there are some other books and stuff available that I think are ebtter than this book.<br /><br />For instance, the Universal BodyBuilding Course.

B0006L16N8|5.0|OK, I'll admit that when Coldplay first hit the scene, I didn't stop to listen. But, when I saw the movie Garden State last year, and heard the song \\"Don't Panic\\" and eventually \\"Fix You,\\" I really started to pay attention. Coldlay is indeed one of those bands that I REALLY have to listen to in order to appreciate and like them. Upon first hearing X&Y, I was kinda underwelmed, but after seriously chilling out and listening, I fell in love with the CD.  <br /> Usually, I find that when I buy a CD, I only like a few songs on it, but with X&Y, I like and love 12 of the 13 tracks. \\"What If\\" is a really great track, as well as \\"Swallowed by the Sea\\" and etc. It offers a nice mix of acoustic, soft rock, and great vocals that vary somewhat with every track.  <br /> Great CD. Get It.
0393035158|2.0|This book was recommended to me independently by two people who thought I might enjoy its direct challenge to religious dogma. I started to, but I found that the author couldn't stay focused on his vision (quote from page 16):    \\"This is not to say that the deepest concerns of the faithful, whether moderate or extreme are trivial or even misguided. There is no denying that most of us have emotional and spiritual needs that are now addressed -- however obliquely and at a terrible price -- by mainstream religion. And these are needs that a mere understanding of our world, scientific or otherwise, will never fulfill. There is clearly a sacred dimension to our existence, and coming to terms with it could well be the highest purpose of human life. But we will find that it requires no faith in untestable propositions -- Jesus was born of a virgin; the Koran is the word of God -- for us to do this.\\"    The problem is not the long-winded footnotes (more than 1/4 of the book), nor the overkill of several consecutive pages of quotes from harsher portions of the Quran, nor the author's disdain for mainstream religions, nor his snide cleverer-than-thou sense of humor (e.g., page 18: \\"the stoning of children has fallen out of fashion in our country\\"). The problem is that he undermines his own frontal assault on \\"faith\\" by playing favorites: some religions are OK, others are not.    Buddhism is exempt from being a faith! On page 217, he praises its precise instructions (specifically Tibetan Buddhism, or vajrayana) as if these can somehow be lifted from the context of belief. Sadly, Harris thinks he is being objective. Worse, his gushing admiration for Buddhism exhibits all the wishful thinking and magical \\"wow\\" of a neophyte: He pulls a book from his shelf at random and opens a page at random -- lo and behold, it's Padmasambhava giving an incredibly lucid description of the human psyche!    He should travel to Asia or at least study Asian history. The Kamakura era was born whenzen monks went to battle and defeated the Heian clan of Kyoto. How's that for a peaceful religion? If this episode is too far back in time, try asking some Japanese about zen monks who actively collaborated with the world war 2 effort. If that's too old, ask Muslims in the south of Thailand how they're treated by the Buddhist majority (e.g., villages that are 100% Muslim are assigned a Buddhist village chief appointed by the central government in Bangkok). Or ask Thai Buddhists themselves about politically motivated lawsuits against monks and \\"defrocking\\".    To me, the worst part of the author's hypocrisy is his absurdly arbitrary claim that the mystical branch of Buddhism is authentic while those of other religions (e.g., Sufi Muslims) are aberrant and not representative of the \\"true nature\\" of their respective religions. Pure prejudice.    This book seems to have been rushed to print in order to capitalize on a marketing window related to the current panic in the US about fundamentalism (mostly Muslim fanaticism, but some of my fellow Americans recognize Christian fanaticism as well). The author admits in the afterword that he cut two entire chapters about neuroscience before submitting his final draft -- I suppose he did so because he imagined bored readers crying \\"Spare us, o Lord!\\"    Seriously, though, this book seems to have been motivated by good intentions, but it is dramatically disappointing as an attempt to get people to question the \\"untouchability\\" of religion as a topic of discourse in the US. History will judge whether it opened eyes or merely preached to those already converted to freethinking, agnosticism, and atheism. Or worse, whether it functioned primarily as a club to wield against Islam rather than as a mirror for all religions.    In closing, let me quote a passage from Al-Rhazes (Al-Razi), a Persian physician who lived 1100 years ago and was the first person to record a method for distinguishing measles from smallpox. Principles from his book Fi Nakd al-Adyan are summarized briefly in the Encyclopedia of Islam (quoted below). Standing on the shoulders of a millennium of scientific thought, Harris failed to improve on the fairness -- or conciseness -- of this \\"medieval\\" insight:    \\"The miracles of the prophets are impostures or belong to the domain of pious legend. The teachings of religions are contrary to the one truth: the proof of this is that they contradict one another. It is tradition and lazy custom that have led men to trust their religious leaders. Religions are the sole cause of the wars which ravage humanity; they are hostile to philosophical speculation and to scientific research. The alleged holy scriptures are books without value. The writings of the ancients like Plato, Aristotle, Euclid and Hippocrates have rendered much greater service to humanity.\\"
B0006GAOBI|5.0|Donnie Darko can be viewed as a brilliant reinterpretation of Frank Capra's classic film: It's a Wonderful Life, since its basic theme appears to be the effect each of our lives has on society. In Donnie Darko a young and highly intelligent teenager has found a way to move forward in time so that he can experience his future and decide if he should take actions to change it... As Donnie projects himself toward a propitious date another young man of approximately college age is traveling backward through time to connect with the inquisitive Donnie; Frank (Capra:) having already experienced a pivotal event which involved Donnie's future contacts the teenager and begins to manipulate the sensitive young man in ways that appear designed to resolve issues from Frank's past. One of these is exposing the true nature of a public icon who may have molested Frank when he was a little child. Although the creators of Donnie Darko may have based their story on the theories of quantum physics they seem to have also included Newton's Third Law of Motion: for every action there is an opposite but equal reaction. Donnie and Frank's travel's through the fabric of existence causes a catastrophic rift in the energy surrounding them. It is at the point that their world seems to becoming apart that Donnie must make the same decision the protagonist in It's a Wonderful Life is faced with: would the world be better off with him alive or dead? <br />In addition to the complex and thought provoking plot, the actors play their parts very well on a stage of superbly crafted backdrops that serve to portray an idyllic suburban milieu that is perhaps only a veneer of normality. This is one of those rare films that seems to touch the universal consciousness... <br />
B0007Y08IS|2.0|TEAM AMERICA: WORLD POLICE is a film that'll be enjoyed by those with a penchant for the crude, rude, and socially unacceptable (not surprising since it was made by the creators of SOUTH PARK, Trey Parker and Matt Stone). And although I sometimes enjoy scraping the bottom of the film noir barrel, here the jokes were a bit too crude, rude, and socially unacceptable to be laughable. In fact, I only chuckled a few times.<br /><br />What impressed me about the movie, though, were all of the marionettes (hundreds of them), the elaborate miniature sets, and the `I'm So Lonely' song sung by the Kim Jong Il puppet. You'll note that none of this has to do with the comedic script, too.<br /><br />Making a good comedy-even a cheesy one like this-often requires gag jokes and good dialogue. And although there were tons of gags pulled off in the film (from watching puppets \\"do it\\" doggy-style, to having Kim Jong Il act like a gangster rapper), the dialogue was pure rubbish. I realize that it was making fun of action flicks, Americans and American actors' egocentricism, and just about every other world political state out there, but there needs to be some sort of reasoning to these things that gives the film structure. And this movie completely lacked any kind of coherency.<br /><br />The other bad part is that none of the \\"characters\\" are memorable. Can anyone tell me the names of the Team America team without watching it again? I can't. And they are what the film is supposed to be about.<br /><br />But, again, if you like watching such things as SOUTH PARK, you'll probably enjoy this movie on the same brain-numbing level.

B000002UW1|4.0|I always find it interesting to look back at a group that began as one thing and slowly became another.  R.E.M. was originally a darling of aesthetes who thought the group eschewed commercialism to follow their own artistic sense.  In a way, this album was a disappointment to some when it yielded commercial success.  However, it was not necessarily the group that had changed with this album.  I have found that we change our tastes as we become accustomed to the ever-evolving (unless you prefer \\"intelligent design\\") definition of popular music.<br /><br />I make a point at trying to understand the meaning of lyrics.  However, the lyrics to \\"Finest Worksong\\" are incomprehensible.  There are snippets of this and that, and the lyrics seem more geared to follow the music than to have any grand meaning.  Oh well, here is a song with a catchy beat that simultaneously challenges you to remember the lyrics though it is difficult to do.  Marginally better is \\"Welcome to the Occupation.\\"  Though the lyrics enter and exit meaning, the lyrics give an impression of protest against conformity and the loss of self when you enter an occupation.  Lyrics this deep is a characteristic of R.E.M.<br /><br />\\"Exhuming McCarthy\\" goes for the political throat rather than giving vague impressions.  With words such as \\"by jingo\\" and \\"realpolitik\\" R.E.M. equates (or equated) the political environment of the mid-80s with the McCarthy era of the 50s.  There is a more than a hint of George Orwell's \\"1984\\" as well.  It is songs such as these that kept R.E.M. from the mainstream, since most people seem to prefer the slickly produced bubble gum pop of artists such as Britney Spears and `N Sync.  \\"Disturbance at the Heron House\\" seems a fitting song to follow \\"Exhuming McCarthy.\\"  This song seems to be about the effectiveness of protests, particularly student protests.  There is a lot of action in the lyrics, but the ultimate effect of the characters is more humorous than effective, which suggests what?  I do not know.  The music is catchy and again defies a casual listener attempting to remember them.<br /><br />\\"Strange\\" has meaningless lyrics that seem to be a vehicle for the power guitars.  On the other hand, the lyrics could be contextual with the other heavily political songs that precede this one.  Other than the excellent guitar work, this song is one of the weakest on this CD.<br /><br />Perhaps the last song was actually an introduction to \\"The End of the World as We Know It,\\" because this song is stranger than the catchy beat indicates.  The lyrics are complex and embody a bunch of end-of-civilization concepts, and then poke fun at what \\"end of the world\\" actually means.  This song is perhaps one of R.E.M.'s greatest songs, combining a relatively simple chorus with complex refrains, sliding by political commentary without many people noticing.<br /><br />Up until \\"One I Love,\\" R.E.M. usually created all sorts of artistic music that strived for different effects.  On its surface, \\"One I Love\\" seems like a relatively simple pop song.  By any other group, I would agree.  However, this is R.E.M., and I suspect that this song is just like any other for them; they wanted to see where the music and the lyrics would lead, and it led them to create a marvelous pop song with their unmistakable style.<br /><br />\\"Fireplace\\" again has nearly incomprehensible lyrics, but looking back over them in their entirety, the words seem to be about clearing preconceptions to be able to move forward.  The song progresses to its natural conclusion, which is to throw not only the contents into the fireplace, but eventually the walls as well.  Get it?<br /><br />Keeping in the vein of incomprehensibility is \\"Lightnin' Hopkins.\\"  It seems to me that R.E.M. may have been taking a lesson from the Alice Cooper playbook on this quirky song as there are stylistic places that remind me of Alice Cooper in the 70s.<br /><br />\\"King of Birds\\" is one of the best songs on this CD.  The words are very surreal and full of imagination.  The slow pace of the song increases the power of the words.  I think this style was brought to fruition in the phenomenal album \\"Automatic for the People,\\" which is my favorite R.E.M. album.<br /><br />Keeping in the vein of obscurity is the sinister song \\"Oddfellows Local 151.\\"  This song is neither explicit nor implicit as to the nature of darkness, but the bass-heavy music provides the backdrop and I keep trying to figure out what nefarious lessons are being provided by Peewee.  Whatever it is, I am sure that they can't be good.<br /><br />This album is an interesting mix of old and new styles for R.E.M.  I can hear elements of the group as it started, and I can hear the sound into which they were evolving.  I like both styles, and thus I enjoy most of this album.  However, fans of R.E.M.'s earlier music that disliked their later music may be disappointed.  Fans of their later music who did not like their early music may also be disappointed.  The songs \\"The End of the World as We Know It\\" and \\"One I Love\\" are not characteristic of this album, and some listeners may be disappointed by that.  However, fans of R.E.M. who have enjoyed their music throughout the group's various incarnations of people and styles will find this album to be a treat and a requirement for their collection.this CD.

B0001CCXZW|5.0|Some shows take a while to hit their stride, but this one was brilliant from Episode One, capturing smart, funny, poignant, off-beat, and warm all in one gulp.<br /><br />It's not a 'chick-flick', as the \\"Girls\\" in the title might indicate, although the central relationship does involve around a young thirtysomething mother, Lorelai, and her teenage daughter, Rory.<br /><br />Richard and Emily (Lorelai's parents) are pleasing antagonists. The eclectic townies offer entertaining second and third storylines. And then there's Luke, Mr. Backwards Baseball Hat Diner Owner, whom we just KNOW pines for Lorelai and loves Rory as if she were his own daughter.<br /><br />In this first season, Rory has her first boyfriend and her heartbreaking first breakup. And even though \\"Love, Daisies and Troubadours\\" leaves us with a marriage proposal to Lorelai from a perfectly respectable and charming man in the last episode, with a thousand yellow daisies, just as she's always dreamed, we know that someday, some way, she'll end up as Mrs. Backwards Baseball Hat.<br /><br />If you are already a fan, you'll be a bigger fan after a second and third viewing. If you're not yet a fan, this is a great place to start.
B00020BVXI|5.0|At the time of its release, \\"Spider-Man\\" was considered by many to be the best superhero movie ever made.  It has since been surpassed by three films, one of which is its outstanding sequel, \\"Spider-Man 2\\".  \\"Spider-Man\\" is still amongst the very best superhero movies, though, behind \\"X-Men\\" and in front of \\"Superman\\".    Tobey Maguire stars as Peter Parker, a nerdy high school student who undergoes a series of unusual changes after being bitten by a new species of spider.  Parker eventually becomes web-slinging superhero Spider-Man, in love with the girl next door, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst).  Unfortunately for Peter, Mary Jane is dating Peter's best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco), whose father (Willem Dafoe) is the latest threat to New York City.    Sam Raimi, who previously had directed only cult films (most of which were excellent), proves that he is more than capable of directing big-budget pictures.  He does a great job of focusing on the adventure of the Spider-Man legend, as well as Peter Parker's impossible romance with Mary Jane and his need for secrecy.    The cast is very good.  Tobey Maguire was a perfect choice for Peter Parker, making him a very likable character, as well as one that we can feel for.  Willem Dafoe is enjoyably over-the-top as the Green Goblin/Norman Osborn, while J.K. Simmons is perfectly cast as J. Jonah Jameson.  \\"Evil Dead\\" fans: Bruce Campbell is the announcer at the wrestling match.    David Koepp's script remains faithful to the comics on which it's based, while never being too cheesy or unbelievable.  It's funny and well-written.    Danny Elfman's soundtrack is excellent.  At times it's reminescent of his magnificent soundtrack for Tim Burton's \\"Batman\\".  The music really heightens the level of excitement for the movie.      \\"Spider-Man\\" is a fantastic, fun, and well-made superhero film, but it's also much more: it's a great movie.  Thanks primarily to the directing of Sam Raimi, the acting of Tobey Maguire and a high-flying soundtrack by Danny Elfman, this is a film that can be watched again and again.
B000AGTPUA|5.0|Okay, so it's \\"too scary\\" (as some have put it) for small children. Fine and dandy. Not every movie, or even every Christmas movie is meant for all ages. I myself have a five year old daughter and she wasn't crazy about the film, but of course there are lots of other Christmas programs that she and other kids her age enjoy. I watched The Polar Express alone and I wondered if I'd be wasting my time. I'm happy to say I didn't and I categorically endorse this instant classic. <br /> <br />I won't talk about the plot much, since this is a film that should be enjoyed visually, but it centers around a boy that has grown disillusioned with Christmas and the whole notion of a character named Santa Claus. As he lay in bed on Christmas eve, a mysterious train stops by with the conductor urging him to get aboard. He does and soon meets a young girl that he befriends, as well as a boy who seems more down-on-his-luck and lonely than anyone else on the train. From there, it's all one wild ride to the North Pole, through a toy factory, and finally to meet Santa Claus himself. There's also a mysterious hobo who lives on top of the train. Is he really there, or isn't he?  <br /> <br />There are several moments of sheer excitement, including one extended sequence involving the journey of a lost ticket, a roller coaster ride (so to speak) on the train down a steep incline, and a scene inside the toy factory.  Moreover, this is a great looking film with intense situations, characters to care about, and a subject that is dear to many of us: Christmas.  <br /> <br />
B000002UB3|5.0|As many Beatles fans know, although Let It Be was released after Abbey Road, Abbey Road was the last album recorded by the Beatles as a group, so there is an emotional air about every song.  \\"Come Together\\" was (I think) THE last song recorded by all the Beatles at once, and it is probably tied with I Want You (She's So Heavy) for the hardest rocking track on the album.  Every time I listen to this album, one word springs to mind: class.  This is a truly classy record; John, Paul, George, and Ringo all knew they weren't going to last after Abbey Road and Let It Be, so Abbey Road was their real swan song.  Every song is just as beautiful as the next; especially \\"Golden Slumbers\\" and \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\", which are possibly my all-time favorite Beatles recordings.  Another one of the incredible tracks on this work of art is \\"The End\\", in which the whole group goes all out with awesome solos that lead up to Paul's famous line that all of you know, \\"And in the end...\\" I don't know what would have happened with music if it hadn't been for Abbey Road, but it certainly wouldn't have been as good.
0553801503|3.0|First and foremost, I did enjoy the previous 3 books.  They were written well.  Thus, I was totally looking forward to this next installment. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, my expectations might have been way too high for this book.  I found that the story was more of a setup for the next book.  It was sort of like an introduction to what might happen next in the series.  The story was slow with no major revelations.  <br /> <br />Hopefully, this is not a precursor to another series that drag itself out too long for it's own good.  Im truly hoping that this won't end up to be a 10-20 book series with a serious decline on the quality as the books start piling up.
B000002UAR|5.0|... but this might be my all time favorite Beatles album.  Of course, every single song of every single Beatles album is better that every single song of every single album released in the past two years (Besides Radiohead and the Mars Volta), but there is something magical about this album, probably because it was the beginning of the \\"psychedelic\\" years, which was when the Beatles were at their best.  Revolver is one of those albums that you can put on and forget about everything going on around you, because there is a daring and powerful vibe about every single song, and it just blocks out everything you had been thinking about before.Revolver is a masterpiece, and your Beatles collection is not complete without it.
B000AADYRQ|4.0|I am a longtime Death Cab fan ever since the \\"We have the Facts\\" days, and I must say that I absolutely love \\"Plans.\\" Stylistically, it is their best. For all the people who are disgruntled about the production quality and write it off as too \\"slick,\\" listen closer, ok? Chris Walla recorded the album, just like any of their other albums. Their new deal with Atlantic just enables them to spend more time crafting the after-product. I think that they have greatly benefitted from this on \\"Plans.\\" Songs like \\"Marching Bands of Manhattan\\" and \\"Different Names for the Same Thing\\" are stellar, and I would argue, are some of their best songs to date. Kind of like a continuation of my favorite DCFC record, \\"The Photo Album.\\" I am in the minority when I say that I disliked \\"Transatlanticism.\\" I thought that it was fragmented and mediocre at best, thought not without its good moments (\\"Title and Registration\\"). \\"Plans\\" takes me back to their pre-OC days and gives me a sense of High School-era nostalgia, the kind where I yearned to hear \\"We Laugh Indoors\\" and \\"Amputations\\" on my local college radio stations. So all I have to say to those purists out there who cannot stand the \\"slick production\\" or the fact that they are achieving modest success: get over yourselves and just listen to the music. If you can't do that, the loss is on you.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Okay, I was a little late on getting into Radiohead, but as far as I can see, when my friend suggested OK Computer for me when I was pretty disappointed in the recent music scene(e.g. Avenged Sevenfold, Fall Out Boy, etc.), it was one of the most important things that happened to me as far as music goes.  Every single song on this album is completely incredible; every one of them is epic, cerebral, and just all around wonderful pieces of work.  You can really tell that these guys are in it to make real, quality MUSIC, and that is very refreshing to me.  If you haven't discovered Radiohead yet, you are not too late.
B0009QTS1M|4.0|This movie was good and it was very well made, but as another reviewer pointed out, it is not historicaly accurate. Commodus was actually made co emperor before Marcus Aurelius died and Commodus was only his last name. Not like it matters but his full name was Lucius Aurelius Commodus.Commodus was an ill conditioned youth when he took the throne at 19 and proved to be a latter day Nero. And like Nero he died an undignified death. A professional athlete was hired to strangle him to death in his bed in 192 AD because no Caeser would have ever fought like a Gladiator in the colisseum. Also Marcus Aurelius was only 59 when he died so he probably didnt have white hair and a beard.There's so many movies historically innaccurate it doesnt really bother me anyway. i thought id just let people know the true history.
B000002UB6|5.0|As many reviews have already said, Let It Be was the only Beatles album that was met with an occaisional bad review, but I think that saying that Let It Be isn't a masterpiece is a crime.  Many of the songs on Let It Be are some of my favorites of all time (Dig A Pony, I Me Mine, Let It Be, The Long and Winding Road), and almost every song is just as wonderful as the next.  I don't need to say much more, because most of the good reviews have already said it, but no album collection is complete without Let It Be.
B000BMSTMS|4.0|I dont why people say this album is soft and poppy, i mean the song Twisted Transistor may sound like a dance but this guitar is heavy. Songs like Liar, 10 or a 2 Way, Getting Off and Hypocrites are the mostly the most guitar heavy songs Korn has recorded. Issues is a their sofest album and poppiest due to girly vocal effects and glossy production. The only people that say this album is their weirdiest and say they abandoned their sound is people who only listen to their singles, look at non-singles from Untouchables and the rest of the albums and u will see that it is not different from their other stuff.
B0002234LS|4.0|Not far off from his usual thrillers and dramas, David Koepp(Spider-Man,Panic Room) once again creates a movie that will keep you guessing and moving in your sit until the very end.  Hooked from the very begining, there is no way anyone will want to leave the theatures before this secret gets out.   <br />  Not only is the casts perfectly picked out: Jonny Deep(Chocolate, Pirates of the Carribean)and John Turturro(Mr. Deeds), but the movie gets the actors at their best.  Never have I seen Jonny Depp perform with such strengh and boldness as in this film.   <br />  Mort Rainey(Depp) is a struggling, recently divorced writter.  He begins to get involved in violent situations with a psycho path John Shooter(Turturro),who claims he stole his story.  Events unravel quickly and accidents keep on getting worse in worse.  But nothing compares to the giant secret at the end of the movie!   <br />  If you want to see a movie that will have you in awe for days and keep you wanting to see more than I suggest you go and see The Secret Window.   <br /> <br /> <br />
0140177396|4.0|Matea G. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Of Mice and Men is a great story to read. Having two different people like Lennie and George come together and do all the things they do is something everyone should learn about. Lennie is mentally retarded and looks to George for everything he does. He forgets everything, but if George tells him anything or does anything then he will remember it. George was the only person who he talked with, and was Lennie's hero.  <br /> This book is about these two different men who travel together and look for laboring jobs. Lennie has a hard time though and always seems to get in trouble, so they always have to leave and find another place to work at. Once they find a place in Soledad working on a ranch things began to change. As they meet many knew people there their relationship begins to change. Both are welcomed but George seems to get along well with all of them as the others begin to wonder about Lennie and his intentions. Soon Lennie gets in more trouble then he has before and with a surprising twist at the end you come to realize how true their friendship was.  <br /> I thought the book was very good. I couldn't really relate to any of the characters but just seeing how there lives were was very interesting and how they did things.  I thought it was amazing how George stuck with Lennie for so long even with all the trouble he makes. In all i thought it was good book to read.  <br />

B00005JO1P|1.0|Seeing this movie left me disappointed.  The most disappointed I have been about a movie in a long time.    Johnny Cash did great music, writing, performance, everything.  The half-assed performances of his songs in this movie are a disgrace.  The actors otherwise did a good job, but remake this thing and lip sync it.    Aside from the bad remake of the music there were some long dry spots that made me wish I was somewhere else.      If you are looking for a movie that honors Johnny Cash, look somewhere else.
B000002JS0|5.0|Album Review <br /> <br />Artist: AC/DC <br /> <br />Album: High Voltage <br /> <br />Date Released: September 25, 1974 - Re-mastered August 25, 2000 <br /> <br />Label: Atlantic Records <br /> <br />Price: $9.99 <br /> <br /> Somewhere in the year 1973, AC/DC found themselves beating on the shores on the United States. Running from the no fame, no glory Australian musical prison surrounded by water. As the band played gigs around New York in local bar settings, they noticed that the singer Brian Adams was not working to his full potential. So, they fired him and hired their limo driver Bon Scott. With little singing experience, Bon Scott was a poet and sang his heart for all to hear.  <br />By the time 1974 came around, AC/DC had released High Voltage in the U.S. The album was shot down by music critics for its crude nature and unusual innuendos, but the American public soon came to love it and AC/DC was on their road to fame. Judging by the musical nature, they could be labeled as meathead power rock. AC/DC hailed from a multi-cultural background ranging from the blues all the way to rock `n' roll. Their main influences were from Chuck Berry and John Lee Hooker. The topics of their songs usually contain sex, drugs, and rock `n' roll. Most people have said in the past, \\"not for the faint of heart\\". The band consists of five musicians, Angus Young-Lead guitar, Malcolm Young- Rhythm guitar, Bon Scott- Vocals, Cliff Williams- Bass guitar, and Phil Rudd- Drums. These five talented musicians soon took to the streets \\"trying to make a million\\". As the band progressed, people started to see a rapid change in the image AC/DC portrayed. Going from bars to live shows, they soon were labeled as roughnecks that stirred up the young population turning fans from around the world. From drinking and causing fights, AC/DC moved fast to the top of the rock charts. Fans from around the world came to see the awesome wild ride they became to be. <br />First impressions are rare with these hoodlums. The music needs to sink in over time. My first impression was more like, \\"wow, these guys rock!\\" The most basic impressions are more like its loud and fast. Not many bands can compare to these wild tone monsters, but the best example I could find would be Judas Priest.  <br />The first track that has caught my heart is \\"It's Along Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock `N' Roll)\\". This song has got me good because I have formed a rock `n' roll band that has so much heart and soul as the great AC/DC did so many times, at so many shows. \\"It's along way to the top if you wanna rock `n' roll. If you think its easy doin' one night stands, try playin' in a rock roll band.\\" It's along way to the top and people have to fight to get what they truly want in this life. <br />\\"Rock `N' Roll Singer\\" is one of the finest tributes to anyone who had a dream and lived it. I see this song as a milestone in music because so many have tried to capture the true emotion of dreams, but never came close. \\"Gonna be a rock 'n' roll star. Well, I worked real hard and bought myself a rock 'n' roll guitar. I gotta be on top some day, I wanna be a star.\\" These words are straight from the heart of the amazing Bon Scott and Malcolm Young. <br />\\"The Jack\\" I didn't appreciate this song for a few reasons. One reason is that, the song is very simple and a little too slow. The other reason may come from lack of true \\"rock your socks off rhythm\\". \\"Poker face was her name, poker face was her nature. Poker straight was her game, if she knew she could get ya.\\" <br />\\"Live Wire\\" Truly an amazing song that showed the listeners how tough AC/DC actually was, and how they viewed themselves. This songs riff amazes me because of its ballsy reputation. I'm as cool as a body on ice, or hotter than a rollin' dice. Send you to heaven, take you to hell. I ain't foolin', can't you tell.\\" Chilling, isn't it.  <br />\\"T.N.T\\" Over played but still one of the best. \\"So lock up your daughter, lock up your wife. Lock up the back door and run for your life. The man is back in town, don't you mess me 'round.\\" Good stuff, I love it! <br />\\"Can I Sit Next to You Girl\\" A good song if you want a lady. \\"I met this girl for the first time on Saturday night. Standing in the queue at the Odeon alright, then I took her by surprise. When I threw her one of my lines, she started smiling and being real fine (ha ha).\\" I still can't get enough of Bon Scott and his way with words. <br />\\"Little Lover\\" Ever have a girl that everyone wanted? This song really gets down and dirty with that subject. \\"I hope you liked the show. When the band said good night, I had to say hello.\\" I like this song for it's rockin' rhythm and sweet lyrics.  <br />\\"She's Got Balls\\" Little do people know about Bon, he had a wife that never called him and stole his money. \\"She's got balls my lady, likes to crawl my lady. On her hands and knees all around the floor, no one has to tell her what a fella is for\\" Something about this song seems to help with break ups. <br />\\"High Voltage(Rock `N' Roll)\\" This is the best, I love it. Some people wear ripped clothes, some people don't make enough money, and some people just don't care. Hey it's alright, just play some \\"High Voltage Rock `N' Roll\\".  You ask me 'bout the clothes I wear and you ask me why I grow my hair. And you ask me why I'm in a band I dig doin' one night stands; you wanna see me do my thing. All you gotta do is plug me into high voltage rockin' roll.\\" That's my favorite song on the cd, because I love Bon Scott and I love good music. The rhythm just takes my away.  <br /> In all the ways I could wrap this up, I leave the public with this. \\"Rockin' `N' Roll ain't noise pollution, rock `n' roll ain't gonna die.\\" I assure anyone who buys this album will be pleased. If not, maybe it's not the style one's looking for. All I know is that, these guys love what they do and love the fans who back them up. That's one reason why these guys are my musical heroes. The fans will keep coming as the next album unfolds to the public. AC/DC is here to stay because people want it and these serve it. I think that their style has meloed out, but if a fifty year old man can play like he's twenty, they are here to stay.   <br />   <br />
B00004HYLF|2.0|I first became interested in fusion the day my dad threw the mahavishnu record Visions of Emerald Beyond on his turntable. The sheer power and emotion of that record assaulted me completely. I then listened to RTF's Light as a Feather and the mellow chords and melodies entranced me. I then listened to Where Have I Known You Before by RTF and I was floored by the drive, the bass playing, the guitar playing, the drumming, and chick corea's synths and piano work. That album is a masterpiece. Later I went out and bought Romantic Warrior... just after 10 minutes of trying to cope with the cheesy synths and boring grooves, I had to turn it off. This is a landmark of the commercialization of fusion and nothing more. Ive been trying to understand why there was such a sudden turn from the previous album's energy and enthusiasm, and why this album is so popular.
0833552929|5.0|The novel, The Joy Luck Club, by Amy Tan displays a mind-blowing plot that has topics of hardship and culture everyone could relate to. The book focuses on the struggles of four Chinese American women's journey emigrating from China to America. In America they struggle with the hardships of being illiterate and raising they're first-generation American born children, seeking to teach them the same cultural standards as they were raised upon in China. The setting takes place in San Francisco, California where the women meet each week at each other's house to play Mahjong, eat Chinese food, and share stories. The Joy Luck Club was started back in China where the main character Suyuan Woo and her group of friends at the time met together to as a way to escape and vent about the horrific war between China and Japan. They held parties each week as if it was a new year, forgetting the past wrongs condemned on them. When Suyuan immigrated to America, she had nothing but the clothes on her back and the traditions and memories of the Joy Luck Club. Feeling lost and alone in America she and her husband decided to attend church where they met other immigrants that would soon fill the three other seats of the joy luck club. Forty years after the joy luck club started Suyuan died, \\"just like a rabbit: quickly and with unfinished business left behind (5),\\" it is her daughter's (Jing-Mei) duty to fill the fourth corner of the joy luck club and fix her mothers unfinished business left behind in China.   <br /> This book not only displays the hardships and culture shock of coming to America but the mother, daughter, sister, and marriage relationships. The book really makes you feel empathetic for the daughter's struggle of being a first generation American, because of the different moral and overachieving standards from each culture. The only problem with the book is it doesn't have translations for some of the Chinese terms the characters use. I highly recommended this book, especially natives of San Franciscan's who can really picture and understand the agriculture monuments and setting from the book. Being Chinese American, I could really relate and picture the same traditions and standards from this book in my family. This book not only has topics Chinese Americans could relate to but other people who can relate to arranged marriages, interracial marriages, and absent parents. Don't be intimidated by the many pages and small print because once you start reading you won't be able to put the book down until you finish. If you cannot trust my word you can always watch the movie, which I hope aspire you to read the book and conclude with the same opinion, that you could recommend to your friends and family to get this book noticed.    <br /> <br /> <br />
0345457684|5.0|Despite the boring, bland and terrible cover art here, this novel drew my interest, due to all the positive reviews and what the synopsis read. <br /> <br />So, I gave it a whirl. <br /> <br />And damn glad I did! From beginning to end, Mr. Morgan shows himself to be a visionary sci-fi action/adventure writer. I'll definately be reading the next two volumes of this series. <br /> <br />
B000002H6C|2.0|And Justice for All.    Metallica's attempt to take the success of \\"Master of Puppets\\" to the next level. This record also begun the trek what would eventually lead them to the title \\"Smashing Pumpkins of Metal\\" and MTV darlings. Thankfully there is still some decent stuff intersperced on this album.    I have this on vinyl. Bought it when it came out. I recently threw it down on the turntable. Simply put, it does hold up to me over 15 years later.    First the mix, my God is it awful. Its the driest most unpleasant sound I've heard on a album. It has no warmth, no passion and is painfully harsh to my ears. Lar's drums have such a muffled sound. The double bass sounds terrible on Blackened. The bass? What bass? Its buried so deep under the guitars its hardly noticable. It hurts my ears after a few songs in.    Its in stark contrast to the gorgeously rich and brutal wall of sound Slayer produced from the same era. Tom Araya's vocals right down to Dave Lombardo's full and rich drums.    Musically the boys try for some depth, but the mix really inhibits any ability to \\"pull\\" you into the record.  Overall, there isn't enough variation here to satisfy you musically while listening to the album. Its just the same harsh sound at differing tempos. There no nice flow ala Master of Puppets here. Nor is there the strong cross section of material present.    Best Moment:  Harvester of Sorrow    Worst:  One (THE video they said they'd never make!)    Bottom line here. There are legions who lap this up and will not give it a critical eye. I have no problem hammering it. The kiddies who put this on a pedistal compare it to the droves of crap which is out there today. Against that it looks like a fargin' classic. Fear not, I do not succumb to that. This album must be taken with a non-biased OPEN *Looks up* Mind. Thus I come back to - The mix is so rotten, and the material so spotty that this is not considered a classic. Not by a long shot. To tag the \\"classic\\" label on this album insults other truely classic albums.    Leaves me to say Metallica's best days ended when Cliff died. Since then, every excercise has been a case study in a band who revels more in media darling status than being the real deal.    If you want to start with a Metallica album that truely smokes - start with Kill 'Em All. That album is Metallica's absolute best.
B000B2YQX4|4.0|\\"Playing The Angel\\" is a curveball. It begins as if Depeche Mode are poised to make a comeback and then puts you to sleep. From the beginning, with the screeching guitar intro on \\"A Pain That I'm Used To\\" you think that they mean business this time, especially after the coma-inducing \\"Exciter\\" from 2001 and the equally hypnotic \\"Ultra\\" from 1997. They tempt you further with an even greater track, \\"John The Revelator\\" and throw a sucker punch with the third track \\"Suffer Well\\". \\"The Sinner In Me\\" is a break of sorts, slowing things down to reflect on our personal vices. Then it's on to the first single \\"Precious\\" which hits the mark with its depressing mechanical keyboard swashes. Then, before you know it, you're asleep as the gas slowly lulls you into sheep counting with \\"Macro\\", \\"I Want It All\\", \\"Nothing's Impossible\\", the instrumental \\"Introspectre\\", and finally \\"Damaged People\\". It's at this point they attempt to pick up the pieces with \\"Lilian\\", but it's already too late as they smack you down into the pillow for the nearly 7 minute \\"The Darkest Star\\".<br /><br />Some might argue that Depeche Mode have always been a singles band more than an album band, but just reflect upon the consistency of \\"Some Great Reward\\" (1984), \\"Black Celebration\\" (1986), \\"Music For The Masses\\" (1987), \\"Violator\\" (1990) and their last consistent piece of work \\"Songs Of Faith & Devotion\\" (1993). These were all solid albums mostly without wasted space or notes. They will not put you to sleep.<br /><br />I think they could have four hits here with the first and second singles \\"Precious\\" and \\"A Pain That I'm Used To\\", plus \\"John The Revelator\\" and \\"Suffer Well\\". As a Depeche Mode fan who owns all their studio albums, the rest of \\"Playing The Angel\\" is pick and choose. If you are a completist like myself, then check it out, otherwise, just download the four to six songs (\\"Sinner In Me\\" and \\"Lilian\\") and skip the rest. I'd give this 3 1/2 stars if I could, along with \\"Ultra\\", and 3 stars to \\"Exciter\\", possibly their weakest work since \\"Speak & Spell\\".to \\"Exciter\\", possibly their weakest work since \\"Speak & Spell\\".
B000BVEKO0|4.0|After losing guitarist Brian \\"Head\\" Welch, Korn opted to release another album without using a replacement, and the results are hardly noticeable. Monky picks up the slack and Korn delivers another 14 bare-knuckled, in-your-face tracks. While there aren't as many radio-friendly tunes on this album as in the past, fans will still enjoy Korn's unique sound that changes just enough on each album to remain fresh.<br />Korn released a limited edition of \\"See you on the Other Side\\" that contains five extra songs and a couple of videos.<br />\\"It's Me Again\\" and \\"Last Legal Drug\\" are two of the best songs on the entire album, yet several fans won't hear them if they didn't buy the limited edition.<br />One thing missing from this album is the rap collaboration that Korn has done on several of their previous albums. However, a cover of Public Enemy's \\"Fight the Power\\" should be on the way.
B000002HD5|5.0|without a doubt, Gentlemen is a masterpiece of raw emotional outpouring...feelings of confusion, indifference, infidelity, heartbreak, and...oh yes, love are all staged against a ragged musical backdrop that is both gripping and fiercely compelling. the album works on so many levels but i feel that Gentlemen works best when listened to in one sitting. preferably with a bottle of whiskey nearby. this is not the kind of emotional record that you will cry to...but one that you may feel anger, disgust, and guilt.
B00005JOHI|5.0|What a wonderful adaptation!  I have to say I love both the BBC and the A&E versions.  I am so happy this movie has been made.  There's so much pressure on any actor playing Mr. Darcy after Collin's portrayl.  However, McFayden (sp?) has nailed this part.  Keira is a much better Elizabeth than Jen Ehle (sp?).  As much as I love Jen's acting, it's hard to pretend she's not at least 30 years old at the time of filming.  (I dont know how old she was, but she was made to look at least 30 imho).  I loved the scene under the rain, it looked like Darcy could barely contain himself from grabbing Elizabeth, and she looked like she wouldnt mind that at all  LOL.  I know, this is not a very intelligent or insightful review, but I'm so delighted with the movie...  I cant wait to buy the dvd.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|Sorry but if you had read the little book that comes with the DVD set, you will have read that the music was put together from old, dusty tapes found in various newsrooms.  The concerts weren't even supposed to be recorded or even broadcasted live.  So my dear, we are very lucky to have being able to view even a part of this great concert at this time. <br /> <br />We should be grateful. <br /> <br />Thanks.
B000AXRTPQ|3.0|Wow! I was reading first pages of this book, laughing and crying simultaneously. If I hadn't left my job at one of big consulting firms a week ago, I would be really tempted to do it, affected by the book. So, the beginning was promising, funny, smart and as real as it gets in the real life of any working mother. I really enjoyed it and was ready to give to Kate well-deserved five stars, but... <br />The second half of the book is disappointing. The humor of most situations is wearing down, and author repeats herself. What's worse, she is getting into all those antifeminist discussions (I may or may not agree with them, but they certainly do not make the book more readable and convincing). Towards the end, it feels more and more like The Manifest of Modern Women. I could feel the presence of the new (anti?)feminist revolution ghost walking on the roads of Europe.  <br />Three stars - and please, if you are still compelled to read the book, save your money and borrow the book from the library.
B000002AZZ|5.0|In terms of the individual songs on this album, they are varied but all strong and coherent.  This album really breaks away from Cohen's other early works in terms of production values.  It has a bright sound, and slightly fuller instrumentation on some tracks.  I would also say that with this album, Cohen ends his classic early period epitomized by his first four or five albums.  As an explanation to some confused reviewers, the song \\"Who by Fire\\" is derived from a Jewish prayer recited on Yom Kippur, with Cohen's english translation not mirroring the original, but capturing its' prescience.

I love his story of the girls because they describe the longing so many addicts have of perfection simple and pure but can never quite find it. Try AA, NA, GOD, or whatever, but James Frey writes like it is.... only YOU can control that rage, fury, pain, anguish, embarrasment, loss, etc. I know first hand and I won't lie this book caused me to keep with my bad habits because I am still not ready to face ME, but James Frey nails how it feels to be an addict....
B00002E23E|5.0|\\"The Song Remains the Same\\" is the first concert video of Led Zeppelin's I have viewed and I have to say (even though Led Zeppelin isn't my favorite band) that this is the best \\"concert\\" DVD I've ever seen. But to call it a mere concert would be blasphemous; It's a lot of things. The Song Remains the Same consists of Led Zeppelin performing songs live (Black Dog, Rock & Roll, No Quarter, Moby Dick, and Stairway to Heaven to name a few) and then we have the fantasy sequences of singer Robert Plant, guitarist Jimmy Page, bassist/keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. Watching this it's apparent how talented these men are. Plant has an great stage prescence, Page is a marvelous guitarist, Jones is a very low-key guy who stands in the background most of the time, and Bonham is on fire when he's banging those drums. I think anyone who likes classic rock (whether you like Zeppelin or not) should see this. A
B000002O51|1.0|eight years in the garage to turn out this sludge? should have been thrown out with the old motor oil! Pain inducing drivel from the second worst band to ever hit it big.(top honors still go to Styx)As long as it took to make,you would think it would sound a little different from the first two records.Makes me nostalgic for Uriah Heep.
B000AGTPUK|4.0|\\"The Polar Express\\" was fairly popular last year, although not entirely liked by critics. Watching the film it was kind of obvious to me why critics weren't completely fond of it, but I do think that visually this movie was awesome and while they could have improved the plot a little bit, I felt the film worked. The movie is based on a thirty page story book, so the fact that they were able to expand it to a 100 minute movie is cool; But you don't really know any of the characters names, so forgive me for the un-detailed synopsis. <br />A young boy who doesn't believe in Santa wakes up one night to find a very large locomotive parked outside his house. A conductor (played by Tom Hanks) informs him that it's The Polar Express which will take him to the North Pole to meet Santa. The boy decides to get on the Polar Express and meets a number of colorful (and nameless) characters, one kid I found particularly annoying. He also meets a fairly creepy hobo (played by Tom Hanks) and eventually meets Santa (played by Tom Hanks) and there's a big elf-rock show at the end of the film (the frontman played by Aerosmith's Steven Tyler). As I said, it's a visual wonder...The characters look very real, except for the eyes which creeped me out. They're very glassy, almost dead looking. It's no Christmas classic, but it's a good movie. B- <br />
038533348X|1.0|Based on the tons of positive reviews for this movie, I can see that everyone enjoyed it. I just finished reading it in school and am now very frustrated.  <br />Cat's Cradle is pointless and so ridiculous that by the first page, I lost interest.  <br />First off, there are WAY too many chapters and for me and my studies, I had to write a chapter summary for each one. Very annoying.  <br />Kurt Vonnegut is trying to be funny during the whole book and because of that, his book is about nothing. He just randomly throws whatever is on his mind on paper and gets it published and famous. He tries to be funny. I say again TRIES. He is not though, his attempts are horrible and all of his ironic passages were idiotic.  <br />On top of it for a student, he made my life a living hell. We would spent the whole class analysing the first line.  <br />\\"Call Me Jonah.\\" Why?! <br />Or: \\"So we had a night to kill in Ilium.\\"  <br />None of this is ironic or funny, it's absolutely ridiculous. This isn't a book, it has no plot, nothing. Its characters aren't developed and well...it's so ridiculous it's stupid.  <br />The title of the book has to do with a very minor incident and it should have been called ice-nine.  <br />The ending is absurd, the whole religion invented is absurd...EVERYTHING IS ABSURD. It's not funny and is painful to endure Vonnegut's billions of attempts at trying to be funny. And then on top it, to have to analyze it and do a final on it...well right now..I'm not liking Vonnegut and I might as well burn the copy of Slaughterhouse Five that I have sitting on my already big book collection. <br />So, unless you are forced to read this trash in school, I would stay far away from it as it's boring, lame, ridiculous, not funny and very painful to endure.  <br />Vonnegut doesn't develop any of his characters so by the end, I really didn't give a rat's a#$ what happened to any of them. And the ending...just dreadful. This book manages to bash religion, not develop its characters, not have any plot, be too long, and not funny. Now that's not a very good book.
B000BMSTMS|5.0|I think the untouchables album was an attempt at (\\"experimentation\\") and it failed.  <br />It was good but only to the ears of a nooby Korn fanatic.  <br /> <br />This new 'Album' on the other hand is completely mixed. On one side of the coin it's experimentation where by they've pushed the boundaries of what old korn fans will accept and what new korn fans will either love or hate. And on the other it's pure unadulterated Mental deleerium and pyschopathic whirlpools of rage so much so now that John doesn't have to scream and shout and cry, it's more painful than that, past suicidal tendencies and verging on the unthinkable. I personally prefere the tracks towards the end as you can really feel everything from the lyrics and style / but i like them all.... exactly what korn stand for. big thumbs up to the big guys well kufing done. <br /> <br />Shaun Roberts
B000AGTPUK|1.0|The book is only 30 pages long and can't possibly be as shallow and boring as this movie. Parents, stop being so lazy and read a book to your children once in a while. <br /> <br />The digital animation makes the already empty, souless charactors look even more creepy. The same guy does voices for at least three different main charactors. The producers shouldn't have been so cheap and actually payed some actual human beings to do the extra voices or, even better, play the roles themselves. <br /> <br />Not only was this the worst Christmas movie I've ever seen but it's one of the worst movies I've seen period.
B000AMJG4Y|4.0|my title says it all its a beautifully animated movie but the only characters u see most of thetime is cloud and tifa i wanna see em all but still a great movie thats the ONLY problem
B000AY74OQ|5.0|I thought the trailers for this movie were very funny (the ones featuring the Penguins). I was pleasently suprised and disappointed at the same time. <br /> <br />The Penguins took over and ruled in this picture! Funny is an understatement! I love the Christmas featurett, it shows that this movie should have been about the Penguins journey! They make you forget that the plot line for the feature is limited at best, with (cout'em) 6 sceens worth watching! If writers spent the time and effort on the movie as they did with the featurette and the dialogue for the Penguins, this would have been a true classic. It's as if I was watching two different movie's one in which I did not care if they got home and one in which I care very much so.  <br /> <br />Overall I would say buy this movie for the Penguins and look for their movie which I heard is comming out next year!
0345440900|2.0|My Sister-in-law loaned me this book while pregnant and I read it through and through and deemed -- it's cheesy, it's condescending and often patronizing but it does have one good thing: The EASY plan. <br /> <br />Newborns are hard enough to understand by themselves and everyone's advice is so contradictory. E.A.S.Y. actually makes sense.  <br /> <br />Baby wakes and eats then plays and has a nappy change and goes back to sleep. It's a cycle that seems to work. Granted it didn't work for us because we had a newborn phase from hell (severe silent reflux) but once her medicine got life under control at 8 weeks it was a good place to start our lives again. <br /> <br />I agree that the breastfeeding advice is terrible and her 'overparenting' text belittles those of us who are attatchment parents. I felt for weeks that my baby cried and screamed in agony because she was being 'overparented' whereas I knew then and know now that she was clinging to me and screaming because she needed me...and pain relief and medicine. This book did a lot to undermine my own intuition.  <br /> <br />Photocopy the EASY section and toss the book.

Diagnosed with ALS also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, Morrie now became the lesson.  Mitch Albom the author of Tuesday's with Morrie, started off in high school as a pupil and continued on until Morrie and his last thesis together star rating.  This book proves that lessons are not only learned in class as Mitch confronts regret and a loss and in the process finds a friend.   People's lives were touched and lessons were learned in this excellent novel it is a well deserved five out of five star rating.   <br />One of my regrets is not being able to read about emotions of Morrie's children and how they felt about there father.  I believe if Morrie's children's feelings were added to the story it might add more detail and give a different perspective to the story, considering Morrie does not spend much time with his children, compared to Mitch.  <br />One of the books strong points were that Morrie was a wonderful person with a forgiving heart who showed others a different perspective on life. He was also able to share his wisdom with others and show them the open window of life.  <br />   One of many amazing things was how Morrie was able to stay strong in front of those closest to him. Even though they feared for his life, Morrie still lived his reaming days as if there was no end.  <br />   Like others we take for granted what we are able to do, walk, run, swim, and stand, but unlike Morrie that's one of his wishes that he would like to accomplish on his lasting days .  So that he may just at least one more time feel the joy of ever day life. Which we take for granted.   I found that his final days those close to him learned many new things. And saw a side of Morrie that they have never seen before.  Myself as a reader became close to the many events of Morrie's life because of the lessons that Morrie taught so well.   <br />        <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0671027344|5.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower is an amazing book.. Stephen Chbosky really captured the way that us \\"wallflowers\\" really view things, how many of us truly feel but can't/wont let anyone know. Being a senior in high school, I can easily relate to many of the problems that go on in the story, suicide, relationships, drugs, depression, confusion, sex appeal, all if it is just so real. The way the book is written makes it all the more personal, a letter to someone who doesn't even know, just letting it all out, every feeling, every incident, everything. This book is very emotional and it doesn't take long until your deep into the characters and their lives. I think that anyone who feels insecure, sad and happy all at once, or just needs a story that is just intensely real.. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is the book to read.
B0000065M3|5.0|...I loved this movie - maybe because I like Mary Tyler Moore?  I judge movies based on whether I become uninterested which happens a lot.  I never did get bored and wanted to finish watching it.  I really enjoyed it.  I am not an Elvis fan per se, but he was great in this one.  I don't like when he is the playboy.  I like this one because he is a doctor and a good guy.
B000BEZQ0Y|4.0|This soundtrack is a great listen for anyone who loved the movie. I thought it was great how they named the pieces after the scenes that their in. You can re-watch the movie in your mind with the music to go with it. Not being much of a classical buff, I do enjoy the elegance of it and I loved how it was light and soulful at once, feeling the deepness that the characters must have felt. I especially love track 15, Your Hands Are Cold. You can practically see Mr. Darcy walking towards Elizabeth in the dawn light. You want to hear him say how much he loves Elizabeth and how she \\"bewitches him body and soul\\". Defenitely a great purchase for anyone who is a true romantic.

Well, I was hoping some of that would be corrected here, but yet again, two repeat tracks get the same edits: the Junior Vasquez mix of \\"Never Gonna Fall\\" loses about 2 minutes, and we once again get the edit of \\"People Hold On,\\" which also loses 2 minutes. Don't have the other singles, so can't tell you if they've been edited, but here are the track times:<br /><br />1. Change (Frankie Knuckles mix) (6:26)<br /><br />2. never never gonna give you up (frankie knuckles mix) (8:40)<br /><br />3. people hold on (dirty rotten scoundrels mix) (6:08)<br /><br />4. the line (black science orchestra mix) (5:57)<br /><br />5. 8-3-1 (david morales mix) (8:23)<br /><br />6. never gonna fall (junior vasquez mix) (8:34)<br /><br />With about 35 minutes of space left on this disc, they could have treated fans right and given us the full club mixes, and maybe added another 2 club mixes. It's definitely time SOMEONE releases a complete \\"Club Mixes\\" collection of all Lisa's singles.
0553212443|5.0|With the myriad excellent film and stage versions of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" out there, the enduring power of Dickens' prose is often overlooked.  If you've never read the original (or haven't since junior high), do yourself a favor and pick it up.  You'll be amazed how relevant some of the social criticism from over 150 years ago seems, not to mention how funny Dickens' wry wit can be.<br /><br />There's a reason this story has stuck around for a century and a half, and it's not the admirable efforts of the like of Alistair Sim, George C. Scott, or Patrick Stewart.  It's Mr. Dickens, The Imitable Boz, himself.  Get to know him.
B000B8QF14|5.0|Green Day have finally celebrated their long years of playing and what better than to release Bullet in a Bible, an epic version of their widely known American Idiot tour, and at their biggest gig since Woodstock 1994. <br /> <br />I see that people have been complaining about the lack of color in some sequences, but I think that adds to the artistic image that the band has been trying to follow with throughout the entire \\"era\\" of American Idiot. It's a very artistic DVD, which takes a little getting used to, but 10 minutes in you realize that it is clearly appropriate. <br /> <br />I also feel the interviews between the performances give a follow-up on what each song represents, as well as their crazy personalities in their early 30's. <br /> <br />All in all; Bullet in a Bible is MUST for Green Day fans, and gives you a completely different perspective of their lyrics.
B0002Z0EYK|2.0|I'm assuming you already know the story. So if you don't and don't want any details then stop reading.     I love stories about ancient wars and epic heroes and so I was extremely excited about watching this movie because:    1) I normally enjoy Brad Pitt's movies  2) If your making an epic film this is really the only epic tale.    As far as the cinematography and music are concerned, this film was definately top notch and really left nothing to be desired in those two areas. The story is a fascinating one, however, David Benioff's screenplay has two huge flaws (among many little details) that really bring this movie down, A LOT.    1. Achilles is going to war to get glory that will last thousands of years (this point is referenced several times in the film). But, in the movie, Achilles really only has two fight scenes and one of them is a one on one duel. Yes, I know the story of Achilles, but I really felt like he needed at least one more defining moment to show he was truly the greatest warrior ever.    2. First let me say I DO NOT like Orlando Bloom as an actor and I don't think I ever will. He plays the same elf from Lord of the Rings in every single movie he is in. As a happy coincidence, Bloom played the character I disliked the most in this movie...Paris. Paris is a weak character, never actually does anything heroic,  and has no redeeming actions or qualities in this screenplay whatsoever. YET, he is the one who ultimately brings down Achilles...while he is embracing the woman he loves who is screaming \\"Paris, NO.\\" YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING!!! Either make the character of Paris more deserving of this action or don't put the death of Achilles in the movie.    Overall, I enjoyed this movie until its horrible and unsatisifactory conclusion. 2 stars
B000AYQLX6|5.0|First let's get this straight.  Jerry McCulley's amazon review says that Lennon's solo career experienced a slump.  Well ok, maybe Sometime in New York City isn't his most beloved album, but by no means was he in a slump! He not only put out a very good disc, Mind Games, but he produced Harry Nilsson, played with Elton John, Johnny Winter and made Walls and Bridges.  Which is one of his best! In fact it stands up to his greatest works, such as Plastic Ono Band, Imagine, and a lot of his Beatles material. Here was a man in a lot of emotional pain, and using music to heal. He has some incredible moments on this disc. First, the writing is very personal. Scared, Nobody Loves You When Your Down and Out, and Bless You.  All bare his emotions for all to see, and questions so much about himself, love, and his longing for connection.  Dream #9 echos The Beatles, Mind Games and the lost forgotten gem Here We Go Again (Menlove Ave).  It is a great mystical track.  The production is very funky on this disc. Some great horn arrangements and strings with a lot of classic lennon accoustics.  This is a great disc, one of his best! In fact to be honest, this is much better than Double Fantasy.  More gritty and full of the New York/LA feel that echoed his lifestyle.  Get it!
B00004WMZW|4.0|Originally released in 1972, looks to be the band's seventh lp. I've seen this disc in almost every retail store I've ever been. Two big hits came off this record, \\"Metal Guru\\" and the pop gem \\"Telegram Sam\\". Other notable cuts I thought were \\"Rock On\\", the memorable \\"Baby Strange\\" and \\"Rabbit Fighter\\". This CD reissue tags on three bonus tracks. Good British glam rock classic, but also just fun to listen to. A should-have.
B000683VI4|5.0|I heard alot of good things about this movie, so I finally decided to check it out recently and I'm glad to say that I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />On the surface this film might seem like the stereotypical romantic love story, but once I dug deeper into the roots of this tragic tale I couldn't help but be tangled up by its honesty in portraying the horrors of senility and the many downsides of growing old.<br /><br />It starts off innocently enough with an old man portrayed by James Garner who's telling old stories from a notebook that he has written throughout his life to what the audience is led to believe is just an old friend of his, but we soon find out that their friendship is much deeper than that.<br /><br />With the eventual heartache that we learn of that these two have gone through, there is also much joy to experience between their unlikely romance of two people who come from very different backgrounds. His love interest, many years ago when they were still teenagers, comes from old money and a well to do family, while he's just a blue collar working man who comes from a lumberyard family with not much to his name other than his pride and good work ethic. They first meet through a random meeting brought forth through their mutual friends, and while it isn't exactly love at first sight, there is a mutual attraction despite the fact that the girl has a date that's taking her to the local carnivale. Through persistence however the young man who had his heart set on this gorgeous beauty eventually overcomes the reluctant yet curious fair maiden. What follows after their first encounter is a blossoming romance that spreads many seeds of both love and obsession.<br /><br />Their passionate romance is relatively shortlived due to the girl's parents and their disapproval of the young suitor, and at the end of the summer their ways part as she goes off to college and he goes off to World War II. They are reunited many years later, but their love never truly went away. New loves have entered their lives, but nothing can stand in the way of their true feelings.<br /><br />There are many moments of soulful expressions and a love that borders on obsession which in this case is pure. The lovers share a bond that cannot be broken by distance, time or temptation. If there was ever two people destined to be soulmates, it was these two. By far the most touching moments come later in life, as the movie flashes between the younger and older years. It was truly heartbreaking to watch the man suffer, seeing the one who his heart belongs to not being able to recognize him half the time, let alone embrace him with her undying love that they have shared so beautifully for so long.<br /><br />Senility and the dementia that's common with this disease is not a pretty sight, and this film makes no bones about it. It can without a doubt completely break a person down to the ground, emotionally and physically. Her condition is merciless, and her husband suffers as deeply as one can possibly imagine, which is made all too clear and real through the beautiful acting of James Garner and Gena Rowland. One cannot help but be moved by this deep and touching experience, and the ending cannot be described by words, one must see it to understand it. Sometimes there are certain scenes in films that can only be felt and subsequently understood, no words in the dictionary can truly explain the emotion expressed on screen. The actors who portray the young Noah and Allie are to be commended for their excellent performances as well, but their love doesn't really become fully realized until the very end. That's when the audience knows how strong and eternal it really is.<br /><br />For anyone who enjoys a good love story that's heartfelt and ageless, this movie's for you.never truly went away.

B000BVD460|1.0|Ok, so the Vanilla Ice rip off artist has a greatest hits cd out.  Who cares?  How many cd's does he have out anyway? 2? 3? And he already has greatest hits?  Um, ok.  So, in those 2 or 3 prior cd's, after he b*tches and moans like a whiny schoolgirl nancyboy about his bothersome ex-wife, now he's back with her.  He's worse than little girl.  He needs to actually grow a pair, as well as backbone, realize he is talent-less, and do the world a favor, as well as his so-called daughter, and just stick a .45 in his mouth and put an end to it. Or, I guess to be rap enough, it'd be a \\"glock.\\" Whatever, just do his civic duty and end it already.  Out.  Semper Fi.
B00009W0U4|5.0|SPOILERS AHEAD  ... One of the most important events in the movie doesn't reach it's full potential until the second most important scene . It's the wrong man that is brutally killed in the club . Everyone assumes that the man killed in the club is the rapist but it's not .It just goes to prove that with out knowing the facts \\"time destroys everything\\" .Even though the movie goes backward in time ,it really doesn't get any happier in tone. It actually gets more depressing knowing what the final outcome of each encounter will be .The final (opening) scene is open to various interpratations (sic) but still adds to the overall mood of the movie .I watched this on a friends recomendation and am glad that I did . Highly Recomended .
B000BW7QWW|5.0|What an awesome movie! I loved it! This is the kind of stuff that I think most people love to watch and the bozos at fox decide to cancel the show. This movie managed to tie up some loose ends, have action packed scenes, change your emotions from happy to sad to angry and on the edge of your seat thrills. There was no foul language so I can take my younger relatives and friends. I'm definitely buying this one. I just have to congratulate Mr Whedon for his outstanding work on this movie and to ask whether the people at fox are in the right jobs? BRING BACK FIREFLY!!!
B000002GWN|5.0|This is a beautiful and brilliant concert album that showcases Ms. M. as a rhythmic innovator on acoustic guitar and dulcimer, a rock-folk-jazz fusion artist, a colorful and painterly storyteller, a multi-textured vocalist, and a songwriter for the ages.  The songs on this album that first appeared on the \\"Blue\\" album are given a brighter dimension (but she declined a crowd request for \\"California\\" so you'd better get the \\"Blue\\" album too).
0345457684|5.0|Let me start out by saying that I read this book in less than twelve hours.  I called in sick from work to finish it after staying up all night reading.  Then I logged into Amazon and bought the sequels. <br /> <br />Altered Carbon is without a doubt the best book I've read this year. <br /> <br />Takeshi Kovacs, the protagonist, is a perfect noir antihero.  With equal parts self-deprecation and sheer balls, his voice is powerful and true throughout the whole novel.  The matter-of-fact first person narration is perfect.   <br /> <br />The character development is superb - these people will not just come to life for the reader, they leap off the page and grab you by the throat.  The future slang is gritty, descriptive, and 'right' without being incomprehensible.  The pacing is fever-pitched; there's not a dull moment to be found.  The scenes, the set pieces, are just jaw-droppingly gorgeous in descriptive detail, but are lean and mean at the same time.  Every word is precisely crafted, and it shows.  Boy, does it show. <br /> <br />In short, there are zero flaws in this novel as far as I'm concerned.  My only gripe is that it was too short!  Now I have to wait impatiently until I get my hands on the sequels...
0634022296|5.0|Ive played guitar for many years. Ive seen alot of incorrect Beatles tab. I even have the Beatles Complete Scores book which also is incredible. But this book is the best if you want to sit down and simply play and sing any Beatles song. Its a nice size and uses the correct keys and chords. Nothing is lowered or raised like U see in most tab books. This is the real deal and a must for anyone looking to play guitar to the worlds greatest songwriters and bands of all time. Keep the music alive people! I wish they had a book like this for solo Lennon and McCartney material. If anybody knows of one, please email me and let me know about it. <br />
B000BKVQTS|1.0|I'm a big Terry Gillam fan...Brazil was genius...but this movie will go down as one of the worst of all time! Boring story, painfully acted and visually dreadful. We wasted 60 minutes of our lives hoping it would get better before we finally gave up. I have never in my life asked for a refund until Brothers Grimm. The theater manager gave a knowing nod and cheerfully refunded us our money. Too bad I can't get a refund for those 60 minutes of my life that was stolen.  Miramax/Disney should be ashamed for putting this film into release.
0451191153|1.0|We should totally organize a massive public bonfire and torch all of Ayn Rand's books. At the very least we should be censoring this type of literature so that impressionable teenagers don't read it and become MINIONS OF SATAN!<br /><br />I was one of the lucky ones who consulted a college professor before reading this. He told me that I shouldn't read it because I was especially vulnerable to its message, and that I might blindly follow it. Boy, am I glad I listened, or I might have found out the hard way.<br /><br />I think Rand is a total FASCIST for advocating smaller government and self-determination. I'm sure she would have felt right at home in Nazi Germany. SIEG RAND!
B000001ELB|5.0|If your deciding to go down the KISS road this album is a great place to start. This album is a remixed greatest hits album. Starts off with the remake of Strutter. Great remake. I love the new (at the time) mixes of Hard Luck Woman and Calling Dr. Love. The begining of Dr. Love is Gene all the way. Other songs remixed are Firehouse, Detroit Rock City and Black Diamond. I love the acoustic intro to Black Diamond. It's sweet.  <br />This album is the best KISS made in their first 4 years. She is thier best song on this album. Aged well too.  <br />Only thing missing is an Ace song and that would be Shock Me. Overall this is the perfect album for the new KISS fan. So stop readin' and start rockin'!
B000BJS4SU|5.0|I'll give John Mayer critics one thing; John Mayer is no SRV or Jimi. But in a time of music that is full of power chords and computerized background music, it's nice to hear a guy show off his obvious skill in a good live album. I'm not sure how many of you actually play guitar, but the melodys he throws together are not easy to pull off. Also given the fact that most of them are probably improvised, I only wish I could be blessed with those skills. Overall I would say this is an excellent album for those who can actually appreciate GOOD guitar playing.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|My husband and I have watched the Firefly series over and over again.  Maybe subconsciously we figure that if we watch it enough, more episodes will magically appear.  It was by far one of the best series on tv, bar none.  It was fantastic to see everyone on the big screen.  The movie was awesome.  Although, we could see Joss' ideas for a whole 'nother season in it.  More please.
014118213X|2.0|I found the characters to be mostly caricatures; there's no sense that any of them are actual human beings. As a result, there's no change -they're static, and whatever changes they supposedly go through feel completely unbelievable. And while much of the book focuses on how different classes don't truly see each other, Forster commits that same sin himself by ignoring the poorest family in the book, the Basts. Instead of making them seem real, he reduces them to mere plot devices.  <br />In addition, Forster, a product of his time, is given to making sweeping pronouncements about the human race. Again, if he intended some irony here (as, for example, Jane Austen, who was so good at shading her prose with those kinds of hints), I'd think better of this book. <br />Novels typically rely on either a solid plot (i.e., the stuff that's happening) or on solid characters (i.e., the stuff that happens in people's inner lives) or both to carry the reader through. I found neither here. At the very least I would like to feel the author's genuine love of language; I can forgive a bad book if it's exceptionally written. I didn't find that kind of prose here. You can skip a good third of the pages and lose nothing.
B000001ELP|4.0|Well Ace wanted to rock but Gene and Paul decided on the concept album just to say they did. I remember buying the tape way back when and my Dungeon and Dragons buddy loved it! As a KISS fan I liked this album by default.  <br />This album actually is awesome. Dark Light, Ace Frehley's final song until the reunion, is raw and awesome. The Oath is a great Paul rocker and I really love the dark Only You and Under The Rose.  This album kinda takes you away to another world. The idea was great but the \\"Movie\\" never happened. I believe some high school wrote a play to it. If you are a new KISS fan you might not understand this album but give it a chance. A World Without Heros is the single off the Album and isn't all that bad either. The album ends with \\"I\\", Gene and Paul exchanging lyrics and it rocks as well. But The Oath is the one song I'd have at the top of my list for KISS to play live. Doubt it will ever happen.  <br />A must for the KISS fan. Give it a chance. At least buy it for Dark Light. Ace is the man!
B00000ILDF|5.0|David Fincher's take on the ALIEN saga has been (and still is) heavily criticised by some fans, which I believe to be unfair and unjust. ALIENS is a great movie, but the typical sequel to a film like ALIENS would have been more `aliens', bigger explosions, more deaths, etc, which, I think, would have cheapened the franchise - and the horror - greatly (though Resurrection did later on, anyway) and would of turned it into a bog standard survival horror franchise.    David Fincher didn't give the fans `what they want' (a sure way of creating a bad movie, or a tame parody even). Instead, he went back to basics. Firstly, there is a lack of effective weapons (like the first movie) that amplifies the vulnerability of the characters and the need to use the best we have in human adaptability - brains, rather than brawn. Secondly, there is only one alien, not thousands.    The 'singular' alien uses cunning and stealth. In ALIENS a batch of them would run into the path of gunfire - queuing stupidly for their demise, even though their intelligence is apparently one of their most deadliest traits.     Like the first film, just because a character is popular, or nice, doesn't mean he/she will survive (though, initially, it is hard to justify the saviour of some of the characters in this film - being that most of them are murderers and rapists. However, their heroics after alters this perception) but that provides the moral backbone of the film anyway - `you're all going to die anyway, it's how you check out that counts' speech speaks for itself.    Sigourney Weaver appears more courageous in this film. She is, after all, marked for death pretty early on - but she carries on in an attempt to destroy the alien once and for all.     ALIEN 3 contains lots of veteran British actors. Brian Glover, for an example, plays an aggressive leader who is more concerned about practicality and self-preservation of himself and `his men' and his character seems to contrast with Ripley's female   'influence'. Charles Dance's character, Dr. Clemence, is probably the most morally strongest (despite his own dark dubious past) outside of Ripley.      ALIEN 3 is different in tone and environment than all the other ALIEN movies. Futuristic looking metallic architecture is replaced by more natural hues - dank browns and burning oranges -solidifying the fusty hell of a forgotten weather beaten monastery/prison setting. Even the inmates' uniforms have the same dank beaten look.    The film can be seen as anti-climatic after the non-stop shoot-em-up of ALIENS, but viewed out of context of that film, this is a stylish movie where most of the horror/terror is always around the corner (we only get brief glimpses of the alien until near the end).    Fincher's unique style (Se7en, Fight Club) serves us a claustrophobic hell-hole of impending doom where the horror is not always what you see, but what you don't see (much like the `haunted house in space' theme of the original ALIEN).    This film is an underrated gem, marred only by its prequel's success. I believe if this film was made BEFORE ALIENS it would stand on a greater pedestal (obviously, with altered storyline).    This is a great film, and even though people have a greater affinity for ALIENS more than this one, it doesn't mean that this is a dud. It is, at the very least, a lot better than ALIEN RESURRECTION.
B000008LOU|5.0|After years of searching used music stores everywhere, I located a pristine example of this CD, and I must say that I am very happy I did.  I have Volume one on my short list of frequently played music, but for some reason didn't buy Volume three when it came out.  Upon Harrison's death, I was trying to buy up everything from him and really felt the lack of this Wilburys CD was going to drive me crazy.<br /><br />While some over analyze things, I will go the other direction.  These are just four guys that have the pedigree to allow for some ego, but they put that ego away and simply have fun with the music that they loved from the beginning.  Indeed, some of these basic three or four chord rockers would fit in on some compilation disc of late `50s or early `60s rock music.  The chord progression for \\"7 deadly sins\\" is so basic that it is in many of my beginning guitar books, labeled in some as the  \\"oldies\\" progression, and several other songs are based on the classic I-IV-V progression that form the basis of hundreds of classic rock and blues songs..  Still, basic or not, these guys make this music work.  More importantly, you can just tell that they are having fun doing what they love.<br /><br />Yeah, I miss Orbison.  Sure, I wish Harrison had more lead vocal time.  But still, I am very happy that I could locate this fine disc.  It will be played often along with Vol. One.<br /><br />Now for my wish... Come on Olivia, we need a Wilburys anthology with the out takes and videos.
B0000026NC|5.0|As the years went by, PULSE somewhat made a lot of people to \\"forget\\" this jewel.<br /><br />Of course Pulse has been more publicized in the media, has more songs and the complete performance of DSOTM, but...<br /><br />Delicate Sound of Thunder was released by the time legal conflicts were still ongoing against Roger Waters. So the remaining Floydians, Mason and Gilmour had the enormous challenge of completing a new tour without Waters and originally Wright, and the not-less-important task to cash in on pretended success to cover expenses originated from the numerous legal affairs occuring at the same time (Mason had to sell one of his many collection cars to finance part of the tour, a sad goodbye for him to one of his most beloved -and expensive- collector items).<br /><br />Rick Wright was legally separated from the band previously by Roger's attorneys and had to appear as a contractor, rather than as a permanent member of the band, situation that was corrected later, in time for the release of The Division Bell.<br /><br />So, against all odds, Pink Floyd (read Gilmour & Mason + Wright and a whole bunch of session musicians) returned with a vengeance, the most successful tour of 1987, even more than the Roling Stones'.<br /><br />All that sort of repressed anger became loose and transformed itself into unbelievable playing that, luckily for us, was trapped in Delicate Sound of Thunder.<br /><br />If you had (I hope you will) the chance to watch the VHS of the same name (when will we have the DVD? Now that Pulse has been announced for DVD release, my hope returns), you'll notice that Gilmour has a big smile on his face most of the time, you can tell they are enjoying themselves and having fun. That sort of environment is felt in its audio portion, the CD.<br /><br />Go buy it in case you're still \\"one of the few\\" \\"obscured by clouds\\". Unless you have \\"brain damage\\" or have been \\"eclipsed\\" by Pulse, you gotta get your hands on this excellent item.
B000BDJ60Q|4.0|This is a very expensive version of a disc that you can get remastered for a better sound at a much cheaper price unless you really must have the mini-lp sleeve packaging.  Admittedly, the album cover is a great work of art though but if you already have the unremastered version of this disc, you are better off getting the cheaper remastered version that's out there.  Overall though, this is a good debut for the quirky but very talented female version of Bob Dylan; a modern-day poet disguised as a pop singer.  Recommended.
B000BO0LLS|1.0|Mariah really needs to stop using words becasue they sound intelligent, cause nothing on this album resembles anything near an emancipation. It is a cheap beat-driven 'album', which can't even be classified as music. <br /> <br />Get Emancipated, or Die Tryin'
B00005M91K|5.0|Baraka is most definitely a film without barriers, cultural or religious, it shows the human being in his/her purest form. The film has no words and yet it tells us a story that a million words could not tell us in a lifetime. The visuals and the sounds bring out our deepest dreams, emotions and imaginations. Baraka brings us back to our primordial senses and creates a universal love, understanding and compassion towards ourselves, our planet and its never-ending beauty.
B000BM6AVA|4.0|I love System of a Down. It seems most modern bands opt for early retirement after their first album. Not SoaD! They certainly give the punters their money's worth, and the best bit is it's not dross. I think this is SoaD's best album since 'Toxicity'. Despite some riffs starting to sound over familiar, all the songs showcase a different dynamic and, most importantly for me, the vocals are really strong with some really great, memorable melodies. It does seem that they're becoming a two-man band, though. For instance, if someone told me Daron recorded the basslines, I'd believe them. It's obvious most of the writing is being done by guitarist, Daron Malakian (but that doesn't matter cos it's strong stuff) and the sound is largely attributable to the two unique singers. In fact, I think Daron and Serj have the best vocal match in rock/metal since Layne Staley and Jerry Cantrell formed Alice in Chains. Stand out songs include the ferocious (and idiosyncratic) opener \\"Attack\\", \\"Kill Rock 'N Roll\\", \\"Vicinity of Obscenity\\" (the closest thing to early-era Mr Bungle I've heard in a long time), and the fabulous \\"Soldier Side\\". The latter song continues where 'Mesmerize' opened up and it does so in truly epic proportions. A really good, heavy rock/metal album played with true conviction. System of a Down... I salute you and long may you live! (Which I've a strong feeling they will.)
0553801503|5.0|Clearly, the reception of this book has demonstrated that, unfortunately, Martin has a lot of Philistine fans who probably would not know how to read if the State had not forced them to.    A Feast for Crows is the best written of the series to date.  I did not say it has the best story nor the best characters, but the writing is nigh impeccable for the first time.  It is unassailably high literature and Martin has now taken complete control over his dialogue and prose in a masterful way.  The three previous books suffer from a fair amount of cheese and corny dialogue and over-indulgence, despite deserving 5 stars themselves.  But in Crows, there is none of that.    I read this book much more slowly then the others, because the writing was like honeyed wine, the sentences constructed perfectly, the lengthy descriptions poetic in their spinning wealth of rich, lush, gorgeous detail.  I read it VERY slowly.  The story was not the propellant here, it was the writing.  And if you cannot recognize that, then you genuinely don't like Martin's writing; you just like his stories and the fact that everyone gets raped.  It's like the difference between Lucas and Jackson.  Lucas has a great story, but his cinematic equivalent of writing is horrible.  Jackson understand that there is more to creating high art than a story; there is skill, there is turn of phrase, there is grace, there is detail, there is character, there is cadence.  People who poopoo this book want more lightsabers and less Ian McKellan, more force lightning and less Howard Shore, more wisecracks and less Tolkien.    Don't get me wrong: I miss Tyrion and Jon and everyone else who is missing; I love the brutal realism and the rapes and gore and action.  I love all that stuff.  But I, like others here, appreciate literature too.  And Martin has created high high literature with this book.  I wish the previous three had been as well written as this, because yes, of course, their stories are better.    But on thatnote, Crows is a wonderful adagio, a respite of lucid breath, in this symphony that is Martin's epic masterpiece.  Those of us who enjoy READING and not verbal television, cherish it.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|With confessions on a dancefloor, madonna may have just crafted the defining album of her career. Stunning in it's texture, and rich in it's brilliance, this album is as close to art as pop can be. If only for the song 'Isaac', this album is worth purchasing, even multiple times. <br /> <br />A word of warning: this album will engrave it's self into your sub-conscious mind, and will become the only thing you think off day and night. It is that brilliant!!! <br /> <br />Just watch her burn.................... <br />
B000002572|1.0|Boston must be the shortest lived success story in the history of popular music.  After the debut Boston album was released in 1976, Tom Scholz and the gang were among the biggest names in the music business, everybody loved this band.  Who would have predicted their rapid rise and fall in popularity?  I'm not old enough to remember Boston, but I have checked their record sales, and it turns out that Tom Scholz released four new albums after the debut came out, and all four of them bombed! <br /> <br />Don't Look Back (1978) <br />Third Stage (1986) <br />Walk On (1994) <br />Corporate America (2002) <br /> <br />All those albums combined don't even come close to equalling the record sales of the debut.  Boston's popularity was so short lived that even The Backstreet Boys had longer music careers than they did.  Boston's mega platinum record sales dropped faster than a brick thrown out of 100th story window, and when the sophmore album was released, it flopped so bad that Tom fired everybody but Brad Delp, and all the band members besides them had to go back to their day jobs to make a living.   <br /> <br />But I still admire Boston for breaking the world record in the \\"Biggest Has Beens Ever\\" category.  I mean just look at that mountain of unsold Boston records they left behind!  All that plastic could probably be recycled and used for all kinds of useful things!  Maybe we could melt them all down and use it as a construction material!  There's probably enough unsold Boston LPs to rebuild New Orleans!  LOL!  Boston----the ultimate has been band! :-)

But then Yubaba steels Chihiro's name and turns it into Sen (you will see why that's bad if you buy the movie).      So Chihiro must remember what her real name is and get her parents and get out of the spirit world.        It may seem like a weird movie but it gets a lot better tourds the end. Over all Highly recomended! You must buy it now! How ever I recomend it for some one 12 and up for some suggesteve themes. But trust me you will love this movie!                     ~*~Purin~*~

I always prefered more metal but after listening to this album I was hooked on it. <br /> <br />All the songs are good and I love the way it sounds !

Brian Tracy has simplified time management and as even added a Frog as a metaphor to stimulate you into action. Since reading Eat That Frog, anytime I want to put things off, I visualize that big ugly frog going rivett, rivett (you can't do it in froggie talk) and I get about it and getting it done. <br /> <br />Don't judge this book by it's size.

B000683VI4|4.0|The Notebook is a story in a story format that opens with Duke (James Garner) and his friend, (Gena Rowland) who are residents in a nursing home. Duke reads to the woman who demonstrates advanced senile dementia and his story serves to recollect and intrigue from her fuzzy memory. The story he reads of Noah (Ryan Gosling) and Allie (Rachael McAdams) is set in the pre-WWII rural south where he is a blue collar mill worker earning 41 cents an hour, and she is the lively daughter of wealthy parents who want her to make a good match. Noah and his father (Sam Shepard) are wealthy in other ways with their love of poetry which is integral to their relationship, while Allie is defined by the pressures for young women of patrician upbringing of the era. <br /> <br />Gosling and McAdams as the young lovers are vibrant, endearing, and explosive on screen as first love blossoms to overtake the plans of Allie's parents for her education at Sarah Lawrence College. While Noah's father supports his choice, Allie's parents are not delighted with their daughter. It is a familiar story of poor boy loves rich girl, pampered girl wants to please her family, and her family wants the best for their child and will go to whatever gets the daughter married to the rich nice guy (James Marsden). Noah and Allie fight, love, and are fated to be separated by the classism of her parents, the war, and her willingness to go along with the expectations of southern society, or so the audience is lead to believe. Noah rebuilds his dream house, rows on the lake, and pines. <br /> <br />Young lovers are contrasted by the devotion of Duke to the woman, and their relationship is the downside of the story as bodies and memories failing, the senior couple have their own problems -- his health and her inability to remember. Visited by grown children and grandchildren, Duke is revealed as Noah, and the woman is Allie. Although loving and supportive of their parents, the children want their father to leave thenursing facility and return to them because they recognize the hopelessness of their mother's inability to recollect her husband, her children and grandchildren, and their long marriage. But, Noah is committed to his sweetheart and stays by her side hoping for a miracle that will bring her memory back. So, he reads to her their story each day and waits for brief moments of lucidity to manifest. <br /> <br />The film is a wonderful example of exquisite cinematography, storytelling, superior casting, and picturesque location that unites in a rare film of charm and sentiment without deteriorating into maudlin emotionalism. With disposable marriages the norm for contemporary society, The Notebook presents the fading notion of loyalty, devotion, and commitment for a lifetime. It is a gentle film with old fashion values and as characterized by Gosling and McAdams, Noah and Allie experience the joys and heartbreak that committed love creates till death do part.
B000BVD460|5.0|I could not wait for this album to be released, mainly for the new songs which are some of his best. I knew that this album would blow up huge which it is currently. The songs on here that are Eminem's top hits are perfect to be combined into one album. I honestly could not find one song on this album which is not a great listen. I have bought all of Eminem's previous albums and none of them disappointed me in anyway. There was some controversy about 'Encore' being a bit 'off-touch' on Eminem's behalf. I thought Encore was equally as good as the others and he did a very good job with the album. I just don't think people are used to Eminem's new sort style he has. It's clear that there is a difference between that and his older songs and people probably didn't adapt to that change. It's sad that Eminem is not continuing on with any solo work but hopefully we continue to hear his music on other rapper's songs, etc. <br /> <br />I couldn't believe how good the bonus songs on this album were. 'When I'm Gone' is an excellent song that shows how his relationship with Hayley has been throughout her life, and a great video to go with it. 'Fack' was DEFINITELY up there with his best ever tracks. Although it is very crude and rude i could not care less as it is so catchy and the rapping on it is phenomenal. I didn't think much of 'Shake That' in the beginning, particularly because there wasn't much of Eminem on it but Nate Dogg really does do a good job as always and is also catchy. Another magnificent track. The live version of 'Stan' is unbeleivably well done. I thought it would only sound good with a female singing but Elton John also does a good job in this. After hearing this it made me consider getting some of Elton John's music. He sounds amazing in this song. I strongly suggest that this album be purchased as it is a good compilation of his best and put together well. If you are a fan of Eminem, indeed you will like this. I presume that anyone reading this who does like Eminem already has this album because otherwise you would be missing out.
0060899190|3.0|I truly love the PostSecret website and I'm always eager to check it out when it's updated on Sunday.  I rushed to purchase it when it came out a couple weeks ago.  Sadly, I was very disappointed.  I was hoping for new, unused, postcards but instead I found mostly familiar ones that I've seen on his site before...and I've only been going there a couple of months now!  I was also hoping for some commentary of some sort, I guess.  It's really just page after page of postcards...   <br /> <br />I still strongly support the website and I'm thrilled to know that a portion of the proceeds go to a suicide hotline.  I wish the book would've been a little better, however.
B0001WTWCO|5.0|Some people can't seem to tell gold from lead, and that this movie won 9 Academy Awards says as much about the trashing reveiw(er)s that \\"didn't get it.\\"    Question: must the characters/values portrayed in a good story only be personally agreeable?  Perhaps observing (vs. condemning) offers insights otherwise unavailable.    And if Seinfeld's Elaine Bennis would rather get fired than watch \\"The English Patient,\\" she probably should be.    \\"The English Patient\\"('s) extraordinary confluence of elements: casting, directing, cinematography, music, etc., is a rare occurrence indeed - perhaps less than 1 percent of what gets produced these days.

B000063DI9|5.0|This is my favorite maiden album, bar none.  I see all the albums before this one getting better and better, almost sequentially, and this one reaches the peak of their genius.  This is a good maiden album to start with if you're unfamiliar with them.  The previous album, Somewhere in Time, was incredible too, but slightly lacked the hook factor in favor of a more progressive approach, in my opinion, although, it did have it's hooks to be fair.  This one took the progressive sound to a new level, not only in a more techinal direction, but in a melodic one as well.  So well in fact that you can easily take for granted the precision of Steve and Nikko in the rhythm section or Dave and Adrian on guitars, not to mention that good ol' bruce always gets it done on top, and he really shined on this album in his ultra-high, operatic style.  So sad that maiden would end the decade with one of the best-composed metal albums, if not the best, only to find the 90s' albums of dismal quality, at one point even losing bruce.  I credit the change to losing Smith after this album, and so all the maiden albums without smith, are terrible, which are the maiden albums of the nineties (up until Brave New World - A major comeback).  At any rate, the beginning of maiden was a more raw, almost hard rock type of sound, and leading up to seventh son, became more and more progressive and refined.  The miracle is that they didn't lose their ability to jam, and they also didn't lose their fans, quite the opposite.  If you meet anybody who doesn't like this album, their problem is not that they didn't like this album, the truth is they don't like the whole metal genre.

I read it over and over again that year and I even won a writing contest to meet Lois Lowry telling about how this book changed my life. You absolutely MUST read this book. It's awesome.

B000A0GP18|5.0|The Longest Yard <br /> Digging a whole and forcing oneself to overcome obstacles is something that people may face in their lifetime.  Add in some comedy, major athletes, and a football/prison plot and you have \\"The Longest Yard.\\" <br /> The struggles of the main character, Paul \\"Wrecking\\" Crewe, lead me to analyze this feature using the Formalist analysis.  How a formalist looks at texts is finds the protagonists, antagonists and central struggle of the storyline.  He must also find the value of the text and ask the question \\"is it good?\\" <br /> The first antagonist of the film is Crewe's girlfriend.  He is an ex-football star and she is loaded with money.  She is basically using him for his image but she crosses the line when she tries to coerce him into wearing a goofy sailor's outfit out in front of all her friends. <br /> Crewe dashes out of the party and takes his girlfriend's pricy car for a joyride.  Only problem is he's drunk and this is where he runs into the antagonist Paul Crewe.  He speeds and gets pulled over by two cops.  After slurring out some insults to one of the two arresting officers, he jets away only to total the expensive car in an accident with a dozen cop cars. <br /> A football-crazed warden of a prison finds out about Crewe's little accident and pulls some strings to get Crewe transferred to his prison.  This is where Crewe runs into three more antagonists: the warden who wants Crewe's help with his own prison guard football team, the enormous prison guards led by the quarterback who want no help from Crewe at all, and the prisoners who really dislike Crewe.  Fist Crewe gets thrown out of the bust by two large guards.  Then the quarterback, Captain Knauer, beats Crewe some more on the way to the warden's office.  But before they enter Knauer strictly tells Crewe that he runs the show around the prison and that Crewe must turn down the warden when he asks for Crewe to help the team.  After Crewe agrees to Knauer, the warden promises the football star that his time will be much easier if he just \\"plays ball.\\"  Crewe is caught in between whether or not to play ball or not when he meets his prison mates for the first time.  Being a celebrity of course they'll know him, but he walks in as one of the most hated persons in jail.  They all hate him because he was kicked out of football for shaving points off a game.  Surrounded by murderers, thieves, and all-around bad guys, Crewe is hated by all of them for cheating at a football game. <br /> \\"Wrecking\\" Crewe decides to side with the warden after a stint in \\"the hole.\\" When asked what could help make the team better he gets himself in trouble by telling the warden all he needs is a tune-up game.  Now Crewe is to quarterback a group of guys who hate him against a superior group of guys who hate him and the rest of his teammates. <br /> Some of the things that help dig Crewe out of his hole are his courage and his athleticism.  In order to recruit some athletes to his team he challenges a leader of a basketball group to a one-on-one game.  He takes a beating and puts up a fight, but in the end he loses the match up.  He does however earn one guy's respect, and later more would follow. <br />Some more protagonists were in the form of inmates.  Caretaker befriended Crewe and served as the supply man.  He got whatever Crewe or the team needed.  Another person of mass influence was the former Heisman Trophy Winner Nate Scarborough.  Scarborough became the coach of the team, and he also helped to influence Crewe in certain areas i.e. where to find the best and most violent players. <br /> The central struggle of the film was the prisoners against the guards.  The guards had always been able to beat up on the prisoners, but now it was time for revenge.  But Crewe's struggle was something else.  He never really had any friends and had never admitted to anyone that he had actually shaved points.  But he befriended the inmates and now really had a sense of family.When it becomes evident that the prisoners actually have a shot at winning the game, the warden tells Crewe to throw the game.  He starts to, and he puts his team in a hole.  But then he is re-inspired and wants to help his team win again.  The team doesn't buy his enthusiasm and they step aside and let the guards punish him.  But for once in his life Crewe has a sense of belonging and in order for them to fight for him again, he must prove it to them.  He relies on his athleticism once again buy running through and around all the guards on one play.  The football star finally gave in and admitted to shaving points, something he had never done before.  He inspires the team to leave a long-lasting mark on the guards by beating them not on the field, but on the scoreboard. <br /> In the end, like most sports movies, the underdogs triumph.  But is it good? Does it have value?  Of course it is good.  The movie and plot were downright awesome.  Not very often do you see prisoners getting the chance to take revenge against the guards that guard them.  Crewe shows that no matter how far down you put yourself, there are always ways to make back to the top and even change your life and the lives of those around you. <br />
B000022TSH|4.0|I pretty much overall enjoyed the movie Chinatown. I thought the plot was pretty well. I especially enjoyed the character and how he never stopped trying to find out what was going on. Even when his nose got cut he would still keep on going. Though I enjoyed the movie I thought it was really depressing because in the end you find out that Mulholland raped his daughter and she had a child. And that is who mullholland was supposedly cheating with. It was actually his daughters daughter as well as his daughter. <br />-eoin

B000BVEKO0|5.0|Yep, Korn did it again. With every album they change their sound and yet you always now it's Korn. It's their most experimental album since \\"Follow The Leader\\". And it's purely exhilarating.  <br />There was a mojor loss within the band as guitarist Brian \\"Head\\" Welch decided to leave the band due to personal reasons. Remaining members said that breaking up was never an option and that they tried to turn this loss into an oportunity. An oportunity to \\"reinvent\\" their sound. And they did... they really did. <br />They all stepped up as musicians. Especially Munky who is now the only guitarist in Korn. He produced some wonderful riffs (very popular first single \\"Twisted Transistor\\", \\"Liar\\",  \\"Coming Undone\\", \\"For No One\\"). David presents his skills most clearly on \\"10 Or A 2-Way\\" and on \\"SYOTOS\\" you can hear Fiedly's spectacular bass playing again. If it comes to Jonathan, his vocals have greatly improved over the years. The band produced a lot of catchy songs that just won't get out of your head. The album is heavy and at the same time very melodic. Some of the songs have a very epic feel in them. And I can guarantee that you'll be stunned when you hear \\"Tearjerker\\". <br />The more I listen to this album the more I adore it. My personal favourites are: <br />\\"Liar\\", \\"Love Song\\", \\"Tearjerker\\", \\"Coming Undone\\", \\"Souvenir\\", \\"Open Up\\" and \\"Throw Me Away\\". <br /> <br />The limited edition comes with a second CD - it has three really good bonus songs, two remixes of \\"Twisted Transistor\\" (one being extremely great) and two live videos. And the package is the best I've ever seen (with a pop-up artwork!).

B000BOH8XW|5.0|On first listen \\"Oral Fixation Vol2\\" perplexed me with its unusual sounds, vocals and beats. Everything sounded really excellent but it just didnt sit right in my ear. This is so different from what we usually get from the rest of the pop performers. The sounds are so subtle and uncommon that it takes some time to get into them and enjoy them for the jewel that they are.  <br />Surprisingly enough, I like the ballads in this album better. Favorites \\"Dreams for Plans\\" \\"Your embrace\\" \\"Illegal\\". Outsanding Tracks \\" Hey You\\"!! \\"Costume makes the clown\\" <br />The only way this album could be improved would be by having Shakira sit her famous behind in more english classes.

B00005JKGZ|2.0|Gag me.  This is everything I hate in a musical.<br /><br />A family in the suburbs of St. Louis are living their life happily while their two eldest daughters, Rose and Esther, contemplate love and marriage.  The beginning sets off the tone nicely: \\"How is this ketchup?\\" \\"Oh well it's too sweet...\\"  \\"What do you think?\\"  \\"Oh, much too flat.\\"  Indeed, the movie was nice enough to use its own device to describe what's wrong with it: sickly sweetness and flat tones.<br /><br />I haven't a problem with Technicolor or sweetness, but these people look like they're made out of marshmallow peeps and St. Louis looks like Candyland.  Even the muddy street looks edible!  Even when worries come up, there's never really any conflict, just a bunch of stretches to try to find a good way of fitting another song in; basic musical conceit, keep setting up songs and it's fun for the whole family.<br /><br />Now the singing is absolutely excellent, I'll give it that, but the music isn't particularly remarkable and the lyrics are terrible.  However, it's all in the name of good family entertainment.<br /><br />Honestly, if it wasn't for the singing and the relatively compelling character of Tootie, who despite her cutesy name and her cutesy image is something of a fledgling sadist, it'd be hard to really care about the plot...  wait a minute, plot?  You mean the thing where these characters  fall in love, then fear a move, then don't move, then just go back to being in love?  Oops, looks like we forgot something.<br /><br />Something else is a bit confusing about this movie... it's set in 1903... so why does nothing about it feel like 1903, at all?  It's so incredibly anachronistic it's appalling.  But see, we're not supposed to focus on any of these things, we're only suppost to feel happy and lovely that everything works out in the end, or something.  It's dated escapism; very little of it seems really appealing or even important theseadays.  I'm sure if you're looking  for a way to \\"fall in love all over again\\" or something, this could be a good movie to cosy down to, but then again, there's a lot better out there for just that same purpose.<br /><br />--PolarisDiBor a way to \\"fall in love all over again\\" or something, this could be a good movie to cosy down to, but then again, there's a lot better out there for just that same purpose. <br /> <br />--PolarisDiB
B000BW7QWW|5.0|The reason Serenity didn't do well in theaters had nothing to do with the movie itself.  The cast was superb, each actor seemed born for their part, the script was fantastic, and the story was absolutely inspiring.  The story was warm, funny, and heartbreaking, and there was an amazing amount of depth present in this film.  Joss Whedon's genius was on high display in Serenity.  The film is also highly accessible.  You don't need to be a sci-fi fan to appreciate it.  I brought two of my gal pals to see the movie and both hate science fiction, but both were thoroughly impressed and praised it as a \\"really good movie.\\"  80+% of critics also enjoyed it, which is rare praise for a science fiction film. <br /> <br />So, why did Serenity perform poorly at the box office?  Because none of the stars were famous.  There were no headliners.  Combine that with the fact that it's a science fiction \\"space opera\\" (a description that turns off most people), there was no draw to the movie. <br /> <br />The movie is a spin-off of the short-lived series \\"Firefly\\" (which was some damned good television).  Like most people who watched the series, I approached it with apprehension (sci-fi is *not* my favorite genre).  I loved Buffy the Vampire Slayer, however, so I thought I'd give Joss Whedon's new series a chance.  I was won over by the third episode, and I almost didn't want to finish my \\"Firefly\\" DVDs because I knew the show got canceled and I simply didn't want it to end. <br /> <br />Lightning struck twice, however, and we were treated to a Firefly movie.  Serenity was everything I had hoped for and more.  I went to see the movie with already-high expectations that I, in my foolishness, thought couldn't be topped.  I was so surprised by the brilliance of the film that I went back for more, and ended up seeing it in theaters three times--that is a huge compliment coming from me, because I generally wait for movies to come out on DVD and rarely visit the theater. <br /> <br />Every time I saw Serenity in the theater, the audiences laughed, gasped, and applauded.  The story is engaging, easy to understand, and even easier to appreciate.  Joss Whedon's mastery over the English language translates into a colorful (in a good way) script, and the pace at which the movie unfolds is perfection--believe me, if there were parts of the film that dragged, I would have caught it after three trips to the theater. <br /> <br />What separates this film from every other science fiction film is its focus on its characters.  This is a human story, despite it being a sci-fi story.  It's not about space travel, wars between supernaturally gifted forces wielding lightsabers, aliens, and discovering new worlds.  It's focus remains with its central cast.  Joss Whedon's focus has always been on people, and his characters are rich, warm, and three-dimensional.  It doesn't require a huge stretch of the imagination to believe these people might exist.   <br /> <br />Too much science-fiction has its characters exist to revolve around their fantastic worlds and ideas.  Science-fiction has a tendency to turn off people because of its tendency to be stories about everything but its characters.  It's hollow and hard to follow.  Serenity is just the opposite.  It's a story about the characters, and everything revolves around the main characters.   <br /> <br />Many critics have described the movie's plot as what would have happened if Star Wars centered around Han Solo.  Indeed, Han Solo was one of the few characters who were more fleshed out and less trapped by their \\"role,\\" so there is some truth to this.  Mal, Serenity's mercenary captain, does, at times, resemble a crankier, darker Han Solo.  Mal is the perfect anti-hero. <br /> <br />Mal is a mercenary who does what he needs to do to keep his ship afloat and his crew together, and he fights in the movie's conflict because he is forced to.  Mal doesn't suffer from pretentions of nobility and has no qualms about running from fights he doesn't need to fight.  However, when the story's antagonist threatens members of his crew and forces Mal to decide between fighting for his people or abandoning crewmembers, Mal chooses the former.  Having fought in the war as a sergeant, the one thing Mal won't do is leave his men.  He is a flawed man with his own code of honor. <br /> <br />As fascinating as Mal (who is played by the funny and dashing Nathan Fillion) is, it's River who steals the show.  River is a gifted teenage girl that was once part of a government experiment.  Her off-the-chart IQ attracted the government's attention, and she was made into a secret weapon.  River became a psychic super-soldier, albiet an emotionally and mentally instable one, as a result of having her brain tampered with too many times in too many experiments.  River is played by the beautiful Summer Glau, who brings extraordinary grace to the character.  It was a treat to see Summer Glau's fight scenes, since she's a classically trained ballet dancer.  I'm sure it was intentional, since the character was described as loving dance, but all the fight scenes flowed like a dance.  I have never used the word \\"graceful\\" to describe a fight scene, but it definitely applies in this case. <br /> <br />You'll notice that I haven't gone into the plot too much, because I sincerely don't want to ruin the surprise.  I had never been so swept away by a film like Serenity.  The first time I saw the movie, I knew that it would be a long time before I would encounter another movie that could take me on a ride as wild as the one Serenity inspired.  The film is action packed and the plot is emotionally driven.  This film is a fine example of the perfection that results in a marriage between good action and fine storytelling.   <br /> <br />I sincerely hope this DVD sells well and that we'll get sequels.  Underworld and Pitch Black bounced back as a result of DVD sales, and I am holding my breath for Serenity 2.  I have never urged readers to buy products in my reviews.  I have always only encouraged and suggested, but this film deserves it--SEE THIS MOVIE.  It's the best film of 2005.
B0007Y4TVU|1.0|Alright..let me start off by saying that I used to be a system fan. Their first album, self titled, was actually really, really awesome. Toxicity was alright but slightly overrated..I've never heard steal this album and I stopped this one halfway through because it made me sick. With a band that started out with high quality lyrics..to be spouting \\"everybody, everybody, everybody sucks\\" and \\"my cock is much bigger than yours\\"...that's just a insult to my appreciation for the band. This album is actually what I consider to be the worst album ever made. It's horrid and for such a talented band..it's a shame to see their talent be wasted on junk like this. Go out and buy their first album..it's much better than this...my god, go out and buy any album..it's much better.
B0007O38F8|1.0|I don't really want to waste my time explaining this album because it already has been said a million times... but I'm going to do it. I listen to rock, alternative-metal, heavy metal, death metal... any type of metal or rock. I mostly put rap on the pay me no mind list, but there are a few albums I have. First, Public Enemy's \\"It Takes A Nation Of Millions to Hold Us Back\\" and a few Beastie Boys albums. I kind of like 2Pac, too. But beside that, I have no interest in rap. <br /> <br />Now the difference between Public Enemy and 50 Cent is one thing. Well... talent and creativity. Bands from the 90's like Public Enemy and Rage Against the Machine (metal with a rapper) sang about politics and something that means something. 50 Cent and all the other rappers today rap about their bit*hes and ho's, their glock 9's and gang loyalty. At the current state of America I can write two full albums... but these guys have no creativity and no talent either. <br /> <br />So when I first heard some songs from The Massacre, \\"Just A Lil Bit\\", \\"Candy Shop\\" and \\"Disco Inferno\\", I wanted to shoot myself. Thats how bad they are. 50 Cent took pop to a new extreme in \\"Candy Shop\\". Enough with getting laid. He acts like he's the only one who's ever touched a women's behind. Get over yourself. I heard the rest of this album when this guy I work with played the album, and I literally took the CD out and used it as a frisbee into the garbage can. Every song sounds exactly alike, and the only thing 50 Cent raps about is the same old crap in every... single... song... <br /> <br />So, if you want to hear the current state of music right now, pop in some 50 Cent, G-Unit, Good Charlotte, Simple Plan, Avril Lavigne, any other rapper who isn't white or shot down (Even though I don't like Eminem, I respect him for his talent and creativity) or any other bubble gum pop music. Whatever happened to the days of good metal music or good rap (!) like Public Enemy, Beastie Boys or Rage Against the Machine? The good ol days of music sucks because it is overrun by teenyboppers and nu-metal crap (except System of a Down) and rappers repeating the same thing over and over again. <br /> <br />Now thats off my chest, I feel much better that I spent 5 minutes of my life expressing how I feel about the music world today. I dont have time to list what music to listen to, but what you should not listen to is any band that started in the 2000's, because every single one of them sucks now. But what would you 14 year old white suburban teenyboppers know about good music... we got MTV, VH1, TRL, BET or whatever the hell. You want good music, listen to something beside million dollar rapper with bodyguards thinking he is all gangsta. G-UNIT!!! Don't you just hate that... it's so old.
B0006L0LOS|3.0|Just got through watching Catwoman with my teenaged daughter and my wife.  My wife tuned out less than halfway through, but I guess my daughter and I were in the right mood--we laughed so hard at how terribly bad this movie is.  Hey, fun fact, Halle Berry actually won an Oscar a few years before she filmed this disaster--it's TRUE!  So, plotwise, apparently this shy incompetent hot girl, played by Berry, gets herself killed by businessmen so stupid that they're bringing to market a beauty cream that hideously disfigures its users--sell that stock NOW!  I fail to see the opportunity for a profit margin here, after the massive lawsuits.  Anyway, in the most touching scene of the film, the dead body of Halle Berry, still looking hot covered with green goo, is approached by a herd of cats, and one gives her the hairball of life.  Berry comes back to life, hacking as one who has just recieved the hairball of life would.  She then engages in all sorts of catlike behaviour, such as beating her boyfriend at basketball, stealing jewelry, beating up men, and turning into bad computer generated automation.  Unfortunately, the sex scene was deleted, so we don't know if Catwoman does it doggie style.  Also deleted were the scenes where she evicerates baby bunnies and leaves their heads on her owner's step, or where she hunts down and eats the rats in the alley behind her apartment.  Every other cliche in the book is there, the acting is terrible, the script absurd, and if you're in the right mood, Catwoman is an absolute treasure.  But whatever you do, don't BUY it....

B000BVD460|5.0|Curtain Call is a greatest hits collection from Eminem that shows why he is one of the biggest selling artists of the last few years.  Eminem's albums have always been stuffed with some goofy filler, but this album distills down his best moments and shows his artistic greatness.  \\"Stan\\" is one of the most haunting songs in the past twenty years and stands as his crowning achievement.  \\"Lose Yourself\\" has anthem like qualities with it beat that pulsates to the breaking point and it won an unlikely, but well-deserved Academy Award for best song.  \\"My Name Is\\" shows off the class clown persona that would become his trademark.  The album has three new songs the best of which is \\"When I'm Gone\\" which is an exercise in the psychodrama that is his other trademark.  Eminem has suggested that he is leaving the music business for good (\\"When I'm Gone\\" suggests this as well) and if he does, the music he left will definitely leave its mark on the musical landscape.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|Trying to convey the pace and appeal of this film is like trying to eat soup with a fork. It has to be experienced, preferably multiple times, for the sheer joy of its absurdity and leisurely social commentary to sink in. That many folks have never heard of it and yet there are over 800 testimonials to it here should give some indication of the glorious cult that has arisen around this film. And that there is an \\"Achiever's\\" edition available, with coasters and a collectible bowling towel, is even more perfect. Sometimes the world's alright.
B000BJS4F8|3.0|Alanis Morissette exploded onto the music scene in 1995 with Jagged Little Pill.  The raw emotion and deep lyrics made it a major best seller and a classic.  It remains Ms. Morissette's best moment and the songs from that album far outshine other the other tracks included in The Collection.  The emotional drama that made Jagged Little Pill so great found Ms. Morissette confused by fame and psychobabble lyrics dominate her future releases.  While there are some good songs like the haunting \\"Uninvited\\" from the City Of Angels soundtrack, the balance of the songs don't live up to Ms. Morissette's early promise.
0385513755|1.0|I realize that I'm coming late to the critical table on this one, but I've only just read it. Pointless though denouncements may be in the face of this book's popularity, I thought it was awful; shoddy religious history, overdone narrative devices, and stock characters in the service of a story that comes to a weak and displaced conclusion that seems to have dropped out of the sky into the final chapter. Everyone loved it, I know. Not me. The illustrations were the only pleasurable part of the experience.
B000B8QEZG|3.0|With her 14th studio album, Madonna again reinvents herself.  This time around the musical stylings are the 70's disco diva sounds that she helped to overthrow with her first albums in the mid 80's.  \\"Hung Up\\" is the album's first single and opening track and is the best song on the album.  The song is catchy and fun and is her best single since \\"Don't Tell Me\\".  \\"Get Together\\" has a moody synth beat and \\"Sorry\\" has a thumping bass line.  \\"Future Lovers\\" finds Madonna equating music & dance to spirituality and religion.  Confessions On A Dance Floor is a good album, but not groundbreaking.
B00008PX8P|5.0|This DVD put Zep past the Stones as my favorite band. It is important to see them over the span of years starting with 1970. <br />It shows their mastery of blue eyed soul, heavy rock and projection of sexual imagery and lyrics. You can see Page as superior to Clapton in technical ability and showmanship and Plant as superior to Jagger as far as Soul goes. <br /> <br />You can clearly see the influences this band has had on whoever came later. <br /> <br />The DVD shows it all!! Remarkable performances that every fan must have. If you are into Rock, this is an essential. <br /> <br />This 2 disc set is a super bargain.
B0000028M7|5.0|Dirt is a charming album so fascinating so intriging (i think drugs had a part of the credit)this is one of the most creative albums they made, lyrics are so full of existencial issues regarding love, society, friendship, mortality etc , etc, wow! i really love Cantrel/Staley creative partnership, all the ideas expresed here were sorrounded of very experimental sounds all of them, Dirt is very conceptual , Alice In Chains is maybe not the heaviest band but is one of the most fascinating <br />HM
B0006A9FMI|3.0|This is a good movie, but not a great one. Being a huge fan of the first Ghost movie, and the suprisingly good TV series, by comparison it just doesn't match up.  <br />   Visually it shines. I'm usually not a huge fan of CG (just look at the awful work in \\"Metropolis\\" and \\"Appleseed\\") but in this movie it's used to enhance rather than distract. Just brilliant. <br />   The story is okay. There are some great ideas kicking around but I just couldn't conect as well with this movie as I did with the first movie. Batou is an interesting character, but the relationship between him and Togusa isn't anywhere near as involving as the relationship between Batou and the Major. <br />   And while the Major does turn up it's just not the same. This is a good movie but it is missing something. Perhaps its the Major... <br />   Now, you've probably read other reviews, and I say the same: Dreamworks are hacks. For example, there is a moment later on in the movie, a quiet moment, and what do the wonderful people at Dreamworks put in the subtitles? (Silence)! You don't need the words \\"silence\\" written at the bottom of the screen at times like that. And moments like this happen throughout the movie! It's lazy subtitling work, and just plain insulting to the viewer! You think with the money they make from all the other crap movies and albums they've released over the years they'd treat there customers with a little more respect by doing a proper job on the subtitling. This is completely unacceptable. <br />    Let's hope in future there will be a proper release, because it is a shame to ruin such hard work from such talented people.
B00005QIPH|5.0|wow. Great album, very good first album also, God I hope this is the sound for the next 10-20 years, because it's awesome.
B000BMSTMS|1.0|Wow, what a piece of crap! I want my money back!!! There isn't one good song on here. None. The single \\"Twisted Transistor\\" they are playing is probably the best song on here but to me, (a die hard Korn fan from the beginning) this CD is a waste. But I guess that's to be expected when you ask a producer who's famous for making Avril Lavergne a pop star (threw up in my mouth) and mix that with Korn. It's almost like Korn is hypnotized and trying to be some crappy pop band they aren't. Come back to earth soon Korn.  <br /> <br />You want to know what the best thing about this Korn CD is? The cover art for the album. So unless you are a really big art fan, then go ahead and buy it. If you're a Korn fan through and through. Do the nice thing and don't buy it. Don't encourage this crap they put out because they might do more of it. God help us all if they do.
B000002LQR|5.0|Holy crap. That's what i said after listening to this album for the first time. not a weak spot here, and if you say that Flea isn't the best bass player in rock history, you are officially on crack. The Power Of Equality, a thrashing rant about America's inequality, opens, and while technically the closer is They're Red Hot, Sir Psycho Sexy could close and we would all be just as well. In fact, Sir Psycho, a painfully slow funk epic that just about epitomizes the Red Hot Chili Peppers' 20+ year career, was originally going to be the album's closer. Other can't miss tracks are \\"If You Have To Ask\\" the funky follow-up to Power of Equality, Funky Monks, which is, as its name says, funky. John plays a great 4-bar intro to this one. Suck My Kiss follows that with no trouble. Give it Away is later, and is again one of the greatest Chili Peppers songs ever. It's about the theory that \\"The more you give, the more you ultimately recieve, so why not give it all away?\\" Under the Bridge is two tracks after Give It Away, and this epic about Anthony's addiction was probably the main reason that the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and it is rightfully so. An underrated song that comes right before Sir Psycho is My Lovely Man, a rocking tribute to the late Hillel Slovak. This is easily the best album of the 1990's, and high in the running for best all time.
B00005JMXX|1.0|this movie manages to do it.  And it's sad.  The idea that the earth is on the verge of another Ice Age has tremendous scientific merit and is one that should be more widely discussed.  In addition there hasn't been a real good epic disaster film in a while and this one could've filled the bill. <br /> <br />Could have, but didn't.  It failed because (and I know this is going to sound like a worn out cliche straight from talk radio) because it was made from a liberal perspective, with all of the attendent elitism, sensationalism, politically correct soapboxing and cultural biases that plague the Left. <br /> <br />For example, this film purports to show the results of a global climate change, yet it focuses primarily on (surprise, surprise) New York City, although LA gets a cameo spot.  What about where the rest of us live, like Greenville, Mississippi, Davenport, Iowa and Fuller's Acre, Missouri?  It seems that for some people the largest urban population centers in the US ARE the United States, except for some meaningless flyover country populated by cave dwellers, fundamentalist crazies and inbred hillbillies.  In any event, focusing on a larger geographic area would have broadened the movie's appeal. <br /> <br />Then there is the incessant and irrational preaching about how man-made greenhouse gasses are causing the tragedy.  It ignores the fact that previous Ice Ages came along without a single factory or SUV pumping carbon monoxide into the air.  Sorry, but you can't blame big business and the Republicans for this one, greenies. <br /> <br />And yes, I got the point that industrial activity may be accelerating the pace towards the next Ice Age, but this position ignores the counter point that man-made warming of the earth may be the only thing that keeps the next one from occuring.  The next time you see someone driving a gas-guzzling 4x4 belching out exhaust, give 'em a hug; they might just be saving the world.  <br /> <br />Then there were the characters, or should I say caricatures.  Quaid plays the role of the concerned scientist (who drives an eco-friendly hybrd) whose pleas are ignored by the evil vice-president, whose only concern is big business. Throughout the story scientists and journalists are portrayed as noble and virtuous, while business owners and workaday people are cruel, stupid bigots destroying mother earth.  <br /> <br />Quaid has a teenage son in the movie.  His biggest problems are his unfair calculus teacher and the girl he likes but doesn't know how to approach; he spends most of the film glaring at her while forgetting to comb his hair.  He is in NYC with his nerdy friends to compete in an academic version of Jeopardy.  They spend most of the time looking smug and pondering questions about how the Americas were conquered by evil Europeans.  <br /> <br />In short, this movie takes an implausible scenario and shows how it affects the lives of people who are so out of the mainstream that few \\"regular\\" folk know anyone like them.  There is scarce attention paid to the average Joe or Jane.  There is, however,  the obligatory African-American homeless guy with shopping bags wrapped around his head who keeps getting tossed out of buildings by angry white men.  This film is so politically correct it's nauseating. <br /> <br />There are plenty of other faults, such as the wooden \\"acting\\" and ridiculous scenarios.  For example, in one scene the son and his elite friends are watching the world wash away on TV when one of them casually mentions he has to drive to Philadelphia to pick up his brother.  He asks the others if they want to ride with him.  The fact that the northeastern US is under four feet of water, making highway travel impossible, doesn't seem to register in his academically gifted brain. <br /> <br />Poorly written, poorly acted, and preachy to the core, The Day After Tomorrow is a boring movie about boring people going through things that should be exciting but are made to look boring.  Watch it if you want to be bored.
0064409422|5.0|Good verse evil is a very common thing in a book. Most books are very predictable when it comes to that. Yet, in the book The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, there are twists and turns in every chapter. This book has all kinds of things, magic, swords, dwarfs, giants, lions, son's of Adam, and daughters of Eve, fauns, wolves, and much more. There is even Father Christmas. I think that this book is set for a middle school aged readers. The reason I say this is, because there are some violent war scene and even a really vivid killing of a main character, I even cried on this part. <br />So let me tell you a little about each main character. Peter, is the oldest of the four children, he is the wiser one of the boys and is very good hearted. Susan is the second oldest, she is the wisest on of the children. Edmund is the most honorable one. Lucy the youngest, is the sweet kind hearted. <br />There is one war scene in this book witch really doesn't give much detail, yet I under stand that this is a children's book and that it can't be too gory. There is much detail in this story. Like the new movie that is coming out, I have vivid images of this book in my head. This book was so detailed and rich with full of life characters and suspense filled chapters. <br />Well I think this book had a vary weird ending to start a series, and am excited to see the rest of this book and what is to come next in this huge series of tales of wonder.
B00005B36H|5.0|This album is very deep. Aenima kept me digging for information for like a year. This one has keep me digging up to this day. I love all of the spiritual, religious, and astonomy references this album makes. <br /> <br />To add onto what Samhot has written. As far as the sun equaling one and saturn equaling 10, this is viable. The song is about letting a grudge go. Saturn represents dpression, whereas the sun represents good health. Also this song focuses on early alchemy. At the very end of the song he sings about letting the stone(Philosopher's Stone) kiss the waters and transmutate the leaden grudges into gold. <br /> <br />When alchemy combines with astronomy you have Saturn representing lead(leaden grudges,depressing grudges) and gold representing the sun (good health, vitality). Therefore he poses you the question to chose between happiness or depression and cast the lead away from your life. <br /> <br />The music capabilities of the band continue to shine in this album and with the new one around the corner I am as excited as a school girl.
B000BJS4SU|2.0|i came into this expecting to be underwhelmed, well ..in fact , i was. I have heard some killer guitar players in my day...dudes with serious tone, timing, and soul. Now the kid has SOME chops, but he has got a long road to hoe in order to ever have any hope of living up to our universally recognised guitar heroes. A marginal first attempt at making this kind of record for him. I would honestly be more interested to see what kind of stuff in this vein he can pull off in the studio, since his live stuff to me is fairly pedestrian for this genre.
B000BP86OG|1.0|I've been waiting years for The Darkness to follow-up their kick-ass debut album. That album, while written with a tongue-in-cheek humor, is filled with songs that rock hard and extended guitar solos that shred. This album, however, falls far short. The songs, with few exceptions, sound tired, uninspired, and over produced. Guitar solos, where present, are cut short. The additions of orchestras, piano solos, and sitar-like guitar solos weaken the album overall. Personally, there are only 4 good songs on this album (good, not great) surrounded by some weak filler. The good songs?...\\"Is It Just Me\\" is a song that retains the AC/DC edge found throughout the first album but sorely lacking here; \\"Dinner Lady Arms\\" which is well written with a good guitar break in the middle; \\"Hazel Eyes\\", the only song on the album which has the kind of amazing guitar work that gives you the chills and brings a smile to your face; and \\"English Country Garden\\", an ELO-like song that's different for the band but has an infectious energy.I want to emphasize that the production on this album really makes the songs sound muddy and watered down...it's time for Roy Thomas Baker to retire. If you don't have a Darkness album already, don't buy this one... get \\"Permission To Land\\" and prepare to ROCK! One more thing, this cd has some kind of copy protection that prevents you from ripping the best songs off the album and making a Darkness \\"best of\\" cd...since I can't stand most of the album, and I can't copy the best songs from the album, I guess it will just gather dust on the shelf. I hope The Darkness can recover from this flop!
0375703764|5.0|How does one describe a book like this?<br /><br />Start here: \\"House of Leaves\\" is a book that's bigger on the inside than it is outside. It isn't a book to be read from the first page to the last -- It's more a story to be explored, and it's a story about exploration. In nearly every aspect, how you read the book is a direct reflection of what's going on in the story at that point.<br /><br />The story itself is complex. It's written on one level like an academic text, distant and carefully-worded, but on another level like a person's diary, full of intimate details and rambling passages.  The academic portion is by an author we know only as Zampano, and it's an analysis of a film, \\"The Navidson Record,\\" about a family who moves into a new house, and the house begins to change around them.  First it changes in subtle ways, adding a quarter-inch to the interior dimensions without adding anything to the outside dimension.  Like the book itself, the house is larger inside than out...MUCH larger, as the family discovers when new hallways are discovered where none should be, and a door appears in the living room which leads to untold depths. The house seems to be unsteady, changing itself from moment to moment, and it begins to consume the lives of the people living in it.<br /><br />As if that's not enough, there's the additional layer of story of the young man who finds the fragments of Zampano's book after Zampano has died, and assembles it, making additional notes on sections, many of which branch into detailed descriptions of his own life and problems.  This young man, Johnny Truant, becomes every bit as important to the story as the Navidsons and the house they live in, as elements of that story tie back into his story.<br /><br />And then there's how the story is told, which in this case is every bit as important as the story itself.  You'll start the book at the first page and everything looks normal enough.  Perhaps you'll notice a few oddities in the early chapters, but for the most part you're still comfortable.  Then it starts doing unexpected things.  Footnotes refer to additional footnotes which refer to previous footnotes. You may find yourself following one note through several pages, only to find another note leading you back to where you started, moving backward and forward through the book to follow the trail. Then the text itself starts shifting around, pages printed upside-down or sideways or diagonally or backwards... sometimes several of these combined onto a single page.  You'll have to physically turn the book this way and that to be able to read everything. Pacing changes with the story as well.  Sometimes things are happening fast, and you'll read at a breakneck pace, 50 pages in 10 minutes or less.  At other times, you're forced to linger over the same three or four pages for half an hour to catch the nuances of meaning contained there.  And all of it, every bit, is tailored to reflect what's going on in the story in how you're reading it.<br /><br />Put simply, this is a book that's not just written, it's designed. And it's a masterpiece.<br /><br />The book I'm most closely reminded of, in terms of the story of the house on Ash Tree Lane, is Shirley Jackson's \\"The Haunting of Hill House.\\"  The concept of a house which is not haunted by ghosts, but which is itself alive and possibly malevolent, is shared in many ways by both books.  \\"House of Leaves\\" a haunted house story in which the monster (if there is one at all) never makes a real appearance, but its presence is always felt.  From this perspective alone, this is one of the most effectively unsettling books I've ever read.<br /><br />The way the story is told only adds to the effect, by turns surprising, delightful, and scary in the way it makes you read.  It's a book to be read actively, aware and awake...to be explored with eyes wide open.  It's exhausting.

0143034901|5.0|I didn't know anything about this novel when I picked it up and haven't always been real impressed with the hot best sellers. Wow, was I in for a surprise. This is hands-down one of the best books I've read in awhile. It has it all from beautiful imagery, murder, intrigue and of course tragic love that makes a wonderful gothic story. If I had to say anything negative, it would as others have stated, tying the loose ends up in a letter rather than playing them out in the story. This is one of those books that when you are through reading, you actually miss the charactors and want to spend more time with them. My husband read it after me and he also became addicted to the story and didn't want it to end. Great book - can't wait to read more from Mr. Zafon.
B00009UW0N|5.0|I love this movie so much. But, it was not scary at all. Get yours with 2 and H20 today.
B00005LOUQ|5.0|This is definitely the best Christmas movie there is, with an amazing set and a tremendous cast and crew. It's a feel good movie, that will keep you laughing all through it. Jim Carrey definitely showed his versatility as an actor and comedian in The Grinch, and I definitely can say this is his best movie yet. It's a heartwarming and hilarious movie all in one, and has been a Christmas tradition for our family ever since its release on video. It's definitely worthy of your purchase, so don't hesitate to buy The Grinch!!
B000002H4C|5.0|Of the hundreds of \\"albums\\" I own, this is definitely among the most listened to.  Forget what other reviewers say about \\"it's not heavy metal music\\" and there's only \\"x\\" number of good songs... This album will evoke and satisfy the audiophile in anyone who can appreciate music, regardless of genre.  Heavy Metal was merely the name of the album, the movie which it aurally illustrates, and the magazine which inspired it.  Don't be so literal.  Don't be so judgemental.  Shut up and enjoy the music.<br /><br />(In fact, buy it, slide it into your CD player, turn it up loud and go for a nice long drive to nowhere... you won't regret it)
6300181553|3.0|If your holiday film viewing includes the movie \\"White Christmas,\\" then you may enjoy this classic where the song \\"White Christmas\\" actually made its debut.  The plot is a flimsy excuse for showcasing numerous Irving Berlin songs (many of them very forgettable) and a few Fred Astaire numbers, including the famous drunk dance in which he was, in fact, none too sober. <br /> <br />There is a fair amount of racial stereotyping, including a perfectly horrible number with Bing Crosby in blackface.  Some of the songs are atrociously poor, to the point of being laughable.  But for pure historic interest as the predecessor of the much lovelier movie \\"White Christmas,\\" this is an interesting film to watch occasionally.
B00005NB0H|2.0|I just received my copy of the 'Deluxe Edition' of the classic album The Who Live At Leeds in the mail today. On hearing just the first few notes it was clear that this version doesn't sound as good as the 1995 release. I bought it for the extra tracks but I have to say i'm very disappointed in it sonically (the 'blanket' effect over the instruments & vocals from the Dolby Noise Reduction is immediately obvious) and I agree with the other reviewers who complained on that point. This version doesn't have nearly the 'ass kick' soundwise of the preceding 1995 release. I'll be looking for a copy as well of the 'Live At Leeds Complete' CD and listening to my 'old' 1995 version instead of this one. Maybe Pete will take the cue from some of these reviews and 'do it up right', both in terms of the completeness of the show and the sonic issues.
6303921248|5.0|OK, girls, let's admit it:  we may claim to watch this flick in the name of classic literature and historic interest, or because of its magnificent production value and the timeless tale it tells. <br /> <br />But we REALLY watch it because of the charming Mr. Darcy, played by oh-so-dishy Colin Firth.  He smolders, he smirks, he takes a dip in the family fishing hole and comes up lookin' better than ever.   <br /> <br />Yeah, there are many other talented actors in this movie, too.  It's a truly gorgeous production and an unforgettably classic story. Your English will probably improve just by listening to it. <br /> <br />But see what YOU remember when all's said and done...
B00003CXAW|4.0|First off, this is a really fine set. The film looks better than I expected and the additional materials are fairly fascinating.  This is a good example of a movie being well-served by DVD.   <br /> <br />Also very cool is the documentary about the lost spider pit sequence and how Peter Jackson recreated it.  I actually wasn't that impressed with the recreation -- it's fine, and I'm sure they had fun, but it's mostly just an exercise.  Still, the documentary *about* the spider pit sequence, and how Jackson and Frank Darabont and Rick Baker et al put it together is interesting enough almost to stand alone on its own. <br /> <br />About THE MOVIE: This is a film I'd always *thought* I'd seen.  In fact, I'd only seen bits and pieces of the original but most of what I knew about \\"Kong\\" came from seeing the remake as a kid.   <br /> <br />I've now seen it, though, and it's a pretty amazing little creation.  Exciting, amusing, passionate, occasionally vicious and always a little mysterious.  I watched it primarily because I'm very psyched for the '05 remake, but was completely impressed and even if the new version stinks (which I kind of doubt) it's done me a service by leading me to this strange little gem.
0743267478|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  It was tragic and funny.  In fact, though, as an American, I really don't know \\"Bollywood\\" movies are.  Maybe that is what this is, and maybe I should see a Bollywood movie. <br />The story is of an eighteen-year old going on a quiz show....\\"Who Will Win a Billion\\". (Anyone watch \\"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\\") is captivating. <br />It is obvious throughout the book that he is intelligent and resourceful, even though he has little formal education and is \\"only a waiter\\". <br />He won (that is not a \\"spoiler\\" comment since that that is part of his story.)  Part of the point of his winning is that he acquired knowledge daily, and he remembered, and it served him well. <br />I was fascinated by each of his stories about how he acquired the knowledge to answer the questions put to him. <br />Each chapter is in fact, a short story...leading you onto the next.  Since I was entranced by the stories, I kept reading. <br />Horrific things were part of this young man's life, but he was able to keep them from overwhelming him. <br />If you should read this book, you will learn more than you want to about what it is like to live in a slum.  But, you will also learn more about kindness, friendship and survival.  Kindness and friendship are tied for first... a book worth reading!
6304698690|5.0|While most children probably would not care, the directing and the cameraworks are superior in the film (as it is always the case with Agniezska Holland's movies). Casting is superb as all characters act at their best.

B000007R1E|4.0|\\"Seventh Sojourn\\" was the seventh of the classical psychedelic era albums by the Moody Blues, a period which began with the release of \\"Days of Future Past\\" when Decca wanted to showcase \\"Deramic Stereo\\" and the group showed what could happen when you mixed rock music with classical orchestrations. Being at the vanguard of the progressive rock movement had its problem when you are trying to play with (or pay for) an orchestra, and the solution for the Moody Blues was for Mike Pinder to play a Mellotron, which the Beatles had showcased on songs like \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" and \\"I Am the Walrus.\\" In fact, Pinder had worked at the factory and was able to have a device made to his specifications. However, for this album he was using a new instrument, the Chamberlain. Unfortunately, five years of making records and touring had worn the group down and it would be another five years before they cut their next album.<br /><br />John Lodge had the two singles that charted off of this 1972 album, but they are also the most important ones in terms of understanding what was happening to the band at this point. \\"I'm Just a Singer (In a Rock and Roll Band)\\" made it to #12 on the charts, and was Lodge's response to the idea that the Moody Blues were not a group of musicians but musical gurus with songs like \\"Question\\" being treated as profoundly philosophical statements. Clearly, Lodge wanted to emphasize that the group was not trying to teach anybody anything. From this perspective \\"Isn't Life Strange\\" (#29) can be seen as reflecting a complimentary view. The other stand out tracks on the album are Justin Hayward's hauntingly touching \\"New Horizons,\\" which offers one of his best vocal performances, and Ray Thomas' sweet and lilting \\"For My Lady.\\" Listening to this album again I was struck by how these four different songwriters could compliment each other to create the distinctive sound of the group.<br /><br />\\"Seventh Sojourn\\" made it all the way to the top of the Billboard album chart, the only Moody Blues album to do so, although ironically \\"Days of Future Past\\" climbed all the way to #3 at the same time. That alone captures the idea that the legacy of the Moody Blues was getting beyond their control at that point. I do not think this is their best album (\\"Question of Balance\\" remains my favorite), but even as a second tier Moody Blues album it makes a compelling argument for fans to have all seven of the works from their classic period.lboard album chart, the only Moody Blues album to do so, although ironically \\"Days of Future Past\\" climbed all the way to #3 at the same time.

0060825219|5.0|The Zahir is one of four books I read by Koelho. This book, like all others written by Koelho, is a fairy tale for adults. It's filled with magic, love, and strength of spirit.<br />This is a book about a man who lost his wife. As the time progresses, he goes through emotions of hate, indifference, worry, hate again, desire, and love. You will find a lot of facts masterfully inverwoven into the story (just like in every other story by him).<br />This novel makes you think and ponder a lot over the subject you've just read about. It is not a fast read like The Alchemist.<br />There are a lot of important messages in the book - the ones that give you desire to go further with your life, to pursue your dreams.<br />I would definitely recommend the book.
0312330529|5.0|Without a doubt the best novel I've ever read. His words flow smoothly holding your attention page after page. I have found fiction to be a combination of actual experience or the knowledge of the same. This is proven by this novel. Mr. Roberts lived the life of this novel. The ending pages beautifully relate his feelings of not only a exciting segment of his life but more importantly his learned wisdom obtained from what most people consider the dregs of society. I will never forget this novel along with its lifes lessons.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|Joss Whedon is truly a media genius.  He showed that first in Buffy and Angel, and though I haven't watched Firefly, Serenity is truly spectacular.  As someone who did not even know about the show until after it had been canceled, I went to see this movie because Joss had written and directed it.  I was not familiar with the series, but I knew that if Joss had written it, then it was worth trying out.   <br /> <br />I'm glad I did.  I loved it.  And it has allowed me to take interest in a series I may not have given a chance otherwise.  The movie is written so that if you are not familiar with the series then you'll still be able to understand and enjoy it.  Though at times it gets a little tough to follow, its relatively easily to comprehend and understand.  If you enjoy science fiction like Star Trek or Star Wars, then you'll enjoy this movie.  Give it a chance.
0446577383|3.0|Fiction: \\"An imaginative creation or a pretense that does not represent actuality but has been invented.\\" <br /> <br />This book is a work of Fiction and obviously the characters are imagery and the plot is unrealistic and is not meant to be taken seriously. (Unlike some of the other reviewers who took it seriously) <br /> <br />But then again, that's what fiction is - a pretense that does not represent actuality. <br /> <br />I picked up this book just to read it and entertain my mind. I read it, finished it, and kept it aside. That's it! <br /> <br />Although I must point out that there are better thrillers out there. <br /> <br />This one is just OK. <br /> <br />Oh! and if you are a Bill O'Rielly fan...don't bother reading this one. <br />
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Right, I need to set the scene here. I never normally listen to albums I get amd hence I never normally get to comment on them as a whole. I don't know how or why I keep on getting them but I never have time to listen to them. Recently I've heard three tracks from this disc on the radio: Get Together, Sorry, I Love New York and Jump. They are all brilliant tracks but the rest of the album is easily as good. The Isaac instrumental is dying to be used for the delight of more minimalist, tribal and electro music lovers. Well worth it and a must have, even if you can only afford one album this year - other than the Gorillaz.
0553801503|1.0|What a disappointment!  Martin's lame explanation at the end (what a relief!) of \\"Feast\\" did nothing to appease the disgust and frustration I felt almost immediately upon beginning the book and everything to reinforce my decision that I, for one, will not be reading any more \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" books. <br /> <br />Martin succeeded in his cheap attempt to crank out a mindnumbingly lackluster collection of words. <br /> <br />I took pity on  his characters, not for the misfortunes that befell them in the book, but for being used so badly by their creator. <br /> <br />Cross Martin off my list of authors to read!
B0007P3582|1.0|50 Cent is simply a joke.  \\"The Massacre\\" is only his second album, and he's already got nothing to rap about.  But he's obviously still hungry for money, so what did he do?  He went pop.  This album contains some songs about guns, some garbage dance songs and the rest are all \\"I-need-you-in-my-life-baby\\" kind of songs.  It's funny how he's making exactly the type of music he dissed Ja Rule for making.  Oh, it also has that diss song \\"Piggy Bank\\" which, frankly, is weak as hell.  I can't believe 50 Cent thinks he's so good, he has the nerve to start feuds with rappers whom actually have alot to talk about, and whom have been around much longer than him.  He disses Jadakiss, Nas, Shyne, Fat Joe, Kelis, and drops even more names on that one song \\"Piggy Bank.\\"  All of these artists have responded back to him, and they can actually record entire diss songs towards him, not drop one line like he does. <br /> <br />He also kicked The Game out of G-Unit just because Game is friends with Jadakiss and Nas.  50 Cent acts like he's in elementary school.  If he knows what's good for him, he'll quit while he's behind with all these beefs.  Don't waste your money on this CD.
B000002GKT|5.0|If you ever really liked hard rock, I mean REALLY LIKED it, you have to get this LP.   <br />Twin guitars, pounding bass, thundering drums, great, up-tempo songs, fantastic singing and showmanship....yep.  I like all that, too. <br /> <br />A couple of the songs filled up a whole side on the double LP this originally resided on.  \\"Rolling Stone\\" is not the Bob Dylan song, but a rambling, story telling epic about a boy, his girlfriend, and her young at heart mother.  The last 3 minutes, however, explode into a hell-for-leather speeded up adrenaline rush of musical intensity.  I would listen to the first 13 minutes or so, just anticipating the take-off.  Not playing air-guitar on the last part is impossible. <br /> <br />\\"Hallelujah I Love Her So\\" is a great cover, all the band members sing verses on it.  \\"I Don't Need No Doctor\\" is the gem on this album, however.  Great riff, great finish. <br /> <br />Steve Mariott was one of the greatest natural showmen in Rock history.  I saw the band, minus Peter Frampton plus Clem Clempson, in Little Rock in the 70's.  Steve had completely taken over front-man duites.  He never spoke a word, he sang everything to us instead.  Played the poo out of that guitar as well. <br /> <br />A great live band at the top of their powers.  Get it.
B000084T18|5.0|No matter how crappy 50 is as of 2006, his debut album \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin\\" is a classic, no questions asked.  This album is hardcore from start to finish (don't judge it as \\"crap\\" just because of the title).  50 actually has a lot to say on most of these tracks; you just have to pay close attention to his lyrics and analyze some of them to get their true meanings. <br /> <br />The album also features good production from artists such as Dr. Dre and Eminem, as well as guest appearances from the other members of G-Unit - Lloyd Banks, Young Buck and Tony Yayo. <br /> <br />50 has fallen off a bit since 2003 (mainly because the money is going to his head) but this album is a straight-up classic.  Don't go by the 1-star reviews because, judging from their typing and grammar, those people seem to be young kids who don't know what they're talking about.

B000C1YL1G|5.0|\\"Curtain Call: The Hits\\" is the contreversial, creative, very talented rapper Eminem's 'Greatest Hits' album.   <br /> <br />This 2-Disc album contains songs such as \\"Lose Yourself\\", \\"My Name Is\\", \\"Stan\\", \\"The Way I Am\\", \\"Sing For The Moment\\", \\"Cleanin' Out My Closet\\", \\"Like Toy Soldiers\\", \\"Mockingbird\\" and many more classics, plus three all-new tracks called \\"Fack\\", \\"Shake That\\" (featuring Nate Dogg) and \\"When I'm Gone\\".  In my opinion, Em did a great job of selecting songs for this album, and the three new songs give us a hint as to what we'll hear from him in the future. <br /> <br />I recommend \\"Curtain Call: The Hits\\" to all Eminem fans, and to all new Eminem listeners as well.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|When I first played this cd, I was immediately reminded of the darkness and textures of her\\"Watermark\\" cd. \\"Watermark\\" is by far my favorite Enya cd and when played \\"Aramantine\\", it took me back. I love this cd. It's familiar yet different. I was a little taken back when I first heard \\"The River Sings\\", coming off of just listening to Madonna's \\"Confessions of a Dance Floor\\" I had dance beats on the brain, and when this track started, it had a very distinct electroninca type of dance beat to it, then it flows into a traditional Irish folk song with the beat running all the way through it. This song could easily be remixed if it fell in to the right hands that could do it justice. Maybe a Markus Schulz ethreal, progressive \\"Coldharbour\\" trance mix maybe? Anyways, this cd is brilliant, the faux \\"Loxian\\" language is beautiful and the songs that are performed in traditonal english are very well articulated. This cd is very much worth the purchase price and the cover art is beautiful and very appropriate for the holiday season!
0684171600|4.0|Jim Hawkins lives with his mom and dad at Admiral Benbow Inn. His mom and dad take care of teh inn. Jim's life was just as normal as any other kid's in teh 1700's until one day an old seaman came and registered at the inn. All was alright with the seaman until one day he fell dead. A map was foujnd in the seaman's jacket. Jim gaters up a crew to seek the treasure,only later finding themselves sailing with some of Flin'ts bloodthirsty crew. Will Jim get out of this mess alive? Will Flint's crew leave them on the island? <br /> <br />Positive Points: It puts barriers in the way of Jim. He doesn't just go to the island, find the treasure, and go home. That would be a short and boring story plot. Jim has to get around Flint's crew and other barriers. Robert Louis Stevenson shows grea action and suspense in his writing. <br /> <br />Negative Points: The ending is a little of a let-down. It doesn't have very much action. It may be hard to do, but if a book has action throughout, it would be a five-star easily. <br /> <br />I think my rating would be 4 1/2, becaust it wasn't a very exiting ending. Otherwise, it was a very good book. If I could, I would like to meet Robert Louis Stevenson.
B00005JOHU|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  The story was great and fun to watch. The movie was made very well - i will definately buy it.  The movie is about an arms dealer and his career - taking you to many 3rd world countries and remote locations.  I strongly suggest watching this.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|Before I begin, I'd like to address the critics and \\"disappointed\\" Enya fans.  The critics have dismissed Amarantine as just another Enya album, only for the fans.  Some of the fans, on the other hand, keep invoking Watermark and Shepherd Moons, as if Enya should just keep remaking those albums over and over again (!) Trust me, this is NOT a throwaway album, and it gets better each time you listen. Furthermore, I have come to understand that no one Enya album is better than another.  It's like trying to judge which Jan Vermeer painting is the best- ALL are masterpieces.<br /><br />I liken Amarantine to a snow-covered forest.  All of the varied colors you would normally see in a forest have been hidden, yet the snow-covered trees and foliage are a breathtaking, magical sight to behold.<br /><br />Contrary to what the naysayers think, Enya has grown artistically.  This time around, she limits her palatte, choosing more subtle means to craft her songs.  The strings, piano, and drums are still here, just reigned in enough to put Enya's vocals in the forefront.<br /><br />I winced when I read other reviewers describe Amarantine by the \\"a-word\\" (acoustic).  You would think that Enya took up folk guitar.  This is NOT an acoustic album.  Rather, it is spare and elegantly restrained.  Also, you will read that Enya's vocals are not layered as much.  There are still ample servings of that famous Enya trademark, but sometimes it's just for the chorus.<br /><br />Now, about the album.  Things start off powerfully with Less than a Pearl.  What at first seems like a typical Enya opener becomes a brilliant explosion of sound and fierce vocalization, which makes me think of being at the edge of a glacier.  One of my small criticisms of Amartantine is that Enya didn't build further upon the raw energy of Less than a Pearl and The River Sings.  Still, this is evidence that she is VERY capable, despite those who think of her songs as all snoozers.<br /><br />Amarantine, the title track, is a simple charmer.  Enya sings the word amarantine over and over in a minor-key, otherworldly style.  It's in the Rain proves that Enya doesn't need that vocal-layering technique to sound beautiful.  Her voice is exquisite, and, praise the heavens, the woman ENUNCIATES.  She saves the vocal layering for the chorus.  This is one of those Enya songs that makes me admire what her and her collaborators can achieve.<br /><br />Now, on to my only other \\"small\\" criticism.  Enya is sentimental at heart, and sometimes succumbs to precious, syrupy affirmations.  If I Could Be Where You Are is a classic example.  I can make it through the song, but it does make me gag a little.  Fortunately, next up is The River Sings, and you are flying again.  I've read comparisons to Ebudae, from Shepherd Moons.  The River Sings is ten times better.  It's like river rafting, or salmon swimming upstream, at least to my ears.  This is one of her best songs ever.<br /><br />Long, Long Journey takes us back down to earth. It's like a cup of hot tea, very comforting.  Plus, there is a subtle drumline throughout.  The first time I heard Sumigregusa, I thought it was another one of those overly precious songs, but I have since changed my mind.  This is Enya singing in her best register- her voice is meltingly beautiful, making her a New Age \\"prima donna assoluta\\".  In the middle third of the song, she produces this echoing effect in her vocals.  If you close your eyes, you can picture the stars.<br /><br />Somebody Said Goodbye sways to a Lennon-esque beat.  It's definitely one of my favorites.  A Moment Lost is the other syrupy song of the set, a small misstep.  Enya sings in a lower, more resonant register.  Again, one that makes me gag a little, but not a throwaway song.  Drifting evokes John Lennon again (at least for me), and features a very poignant bass string obbligato.<br /><br />Amid the Falling Snow is another subtle, majestic creation.  But what comes next has got to be one of Enya's very finest, Water Shows the Hidden Heart.  This is the third of three songs Enya sings in the imaginary Loxian language.  There is only one other singer in the world who could sing in an imaginary language and sound good, which is Elizabeth Frasier from the Cocteau Twins.  Enya starts off with the most beautiful, warbling vocalization, and weaves her singing in and out of the ravishing soundcape.

When Maximus (Russel Crowe) Fights against Ceasar, he kills his, but eventually does die, and then he finally gets to see his family again, in heaven :'( <br />Really touching moment, only time i ever cried while watching a movie. <br /> <br />Masterpiece, even after watching it 6 or 7 times.

B00005JLEU|5.0|Don't mind the storyline, the storyline is bad. Just as with all other Hayao Miyazaki movies. <br />But that doesn't matter, the movie itself is so greatly done, you forget all about the storyline. <br /> <br />I have seen the movie about 7 times, and i still always get happy when i see it, the music, storyline (even though its bad, it stil fits the movie) the drawings. Everything is superbly done. <br /> <br />You also get a really good idea of what the characters are like. <br />And you can't help it but getting a big smile on your face when the baby and the bird are transformed into little rat and fly, its just looks so darn cute! <br /> <br />Its fantasy at its best. <br />Once you are done watching this, you are like: Wow... <br />and then you got watch it again! <br />Truly awsome, a masterpiece. <br /> <br />Buy this now! You won't regret it! (if you like fantasy movies that is) <br /> <br />5/5 stars.
B00005JO1P|2.0|Loved the music in this movie and went to see it expecting to really love the movie...but I was unimpressed. Good acting but the story was just another star on drugs and recovering. <br /> <br />I was also distracted by the unfortunate scar on Phoenix's face. I know he can't help it but it was very distracting to me watching \\"Johnny Cash\\". <br /> <br />My assessment will be in the minority but I didn't come out of this movie thinking \\"gee, great acting\\" \\"wow, inspirational story\\". When I came out my thoughts were, I'm glad I saw it and glad it is over except I may buy the CD. I won't buy the DVD.
0679422714|4.0|This large book -- 813 pages, 635 of text -- is meticulously researched. Virtually every quote is documented in its 160-page endnotes. Only unreconstructed (or new) Maoists will pan it -- and deny the authors' account of Mao's inhumanity and lust for power.<br /><br />Still, the book could have used a good editor. Reading it I was reminded of William Shirer's \\"Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,\\" in which the author identifies nearly two dozen decisions or events as marking \\"the beginning of the end\\" for the Nazis. In Chang-Halliday's book there are just too many repetitions of such conclusions as \\"Mao was interested only in his own power,\\" \\"Mao was willing to sacrifice millions of lives to get the Bomb,\\" etc, etc. The authors (or their editor) should simply have let the facts speak for themselves: those facts are damning enough.<br /><br />There are also a few mistakes that a good editor would (or should) have picked up on. Nelson Rockefeller, for example, was not vice president during Richard Nixon's first trip to China (p582).<br /><br />All in all, however, this is a compelling portrait of a tyrant who surely ranks with Hitler and Stalin -- if he does not out-evil them -- and makes Pol Pot and Idi Amin, who operated on much smaller stages, seem like pikers.
B000BCKFWK|5.0|There comes a time when a review of the movie will have no impact on whether or not a person will see the movie in the theatre, or even buy a DVD of the movie. I think Sin City is one of these movies because in general, Sin City is a \\"love it\\" or \\"hate it\\" movie for critics and fans alike. Strangely, I was in the middle when I saw Sin City in the theatre. I was impressed with the visual style, and I liked the look of the movie, the sound of the movie, the hard bitten over the top language and action of Sin City. I admired what the director, Robert Rodriguez did in bringing Frank Miller's graphic novels to life. But I didn't love the movie. Since that time I've read the graphic novels and I've now watched this special edition extended recut DVD of Sin City and I've changed my mind somewhat. I'm even more impressed and I like the movie a whole lot more.<br /><br />The question is why. I think the first and biggest reason is how this DVD is presented. It offers up the theatrical version of the film, which I feel is essential in any DVD edition which gives us an extended or director's cut. Let us compare. Robert Rodriguez does. The second disc of this set includes the extended and recut edition of the movie, but it's not like your typical extended edition. Since Sin City is based on several Frank Miller books and tells four different stories that slightly overlap, the recut version of the film is now four short films each with its own title card and each one has to be selected separately on the menu. I love it. This works far better for me because we get short films that are self contained and tell a complete story and I don't have to sit through two hours of film just to watch the 40 minute Marv segment \\"A Hard Goodbye\\". Even after watching the theatrical version, I'm not sure where the twenty minutes of extended footage came from. It's probably just 15 seconds here and 30 seconds there and not big new scenes. I can completely skip the short Josh Hartnett section if I want. This is the way I want to watch the film.<br /><br />Besides this recut version of the film, there are also some quality bonus features included on the DVD. First up is Robert Rodriguez's \\"15 Minute Flic School\\". In this featurette director Rodriguez talks about how he decided to make Sin City after looking through his graphic novels and saw that shooting the film would both be possible and a challenge. He talks about specific ways that he was able to save money in the making of the movie as well as how few of the major actors were actually on set at the same time, even if they have scenes together. This is a very interesting look in how this man makes his movies. Next up is the \\"All Green Version\\" of Sin City. This is the Green Screen version of the movie and Rodriguez introduces it, saying that he sped the film up 300 times or so in order that we can watch the entire movie in 10 to 15 minutes, but it gives us the chance to see how little the actors had to work with and how much work went into getting what we see on screen to actually be there. This is a neat feature and it is remarkable how good of a job the actors did with so little on set. We also get to see \\"The Long Shot\\" where we see an on set take with some background footage where Rodriguez and guest director Quentin Tarantino just let the cameras roll for 15 to 20 minutes and keep the scene going. We see some of what Tarantino says to the actors, what actually made it into the movie, and how the actors work and figure out how to play a scene. This is another great feature.<br /><br />Another feature is the Sin City concert.  This is actually just a one song clip from Bruce Willis and his band The Accelerators doing a performance for the cast and crew of Sin City as well as Richard Linklater's A Scanner Darkly which was filming nearby.  Surprisingly enough, Willis is quite good as is his band.  Good stuff here.  The last feature on disc two is a 10 minute cooking lesson from director Robert Rodriguez.Here we see Rodriguez explain how to make his homemade breakfast tacos.  It looks good and I understand that he does this on his other DVDs as well.<br /><br />The first disc of this set is the theatrical version of the film with other special features.  Besides the commentary track, the other features are the obligatory \\"the cars of Sin City\\", \\"the props of Sin City\\" and other related informative but not nearly as interesting as the disc two features.  Two that are interesting are the story of how Rodriguez convinced Frank Miller to let him do the film and Quentin Tarantino as guest director for a scene in the movie.  The rest are fairly stock features.<br /><br />Overall this is an excellent set that really is worth owning if you are at all a fan of Sin City.  This set does the movie and the books proud.<br /><br />And...did I mention that this set includes a copy of Frank Miller's \\"A Hard Goodbye\\", the Marv story in Sin City?odriguez.

B00007H1Y2|5.0|This was, in my world, the album of the year, and something I listen to a million times more often than the Buena Vista stuff, (which I like). I've turned many, many people on to this recording. The melodies are timeless, yet exotic, the rhythms quietly syncopated and complex, Ry's background/ambient guitar flourishes are exercises in restraint while accentuating the hazy atmosphere of the sessions ... and when he adds some slide, it gets downright spacy. And it turned me on to the unique quality of musico cubano, and elicited some pangs of regret that we've been blockaded, politically, from the wonderful aspects of this culture. Definitely Ry's greatest achievement - the Cuban project in general, this recording in particular.
B0007P3582|1.0|You know...I can't wait for Rap to die. Someday it will. Just like disco, it's overplayed and long worn out its welcome. Sure, some of it has a great sound and some is very well-produced and has a cool \\"feel\\" to it, but that's where it ends. <br /> <br />Somewhere in my soul, I keep hoping that MAYBE, just MAYBE, someone will turn the world of rap/hip-hop on its ear and put the focus on things that will actually HELP the youth in the black community to make their lives productive and beneficial to society instead of pushing drugs, profanity, promiscuity, and violence. But nope...these dawgs keep returning to their own vomit time & time again. Just watch BET for 5 minutes or turn on your local Hip-Hop station...it's all the same. <br /> <br />When Rap started, it wasn't about \\"gangstas\\" and \\"ho's\\" and all the other diseases in society today. It didn't take long though, for the dregs of the inner city to turn what could have been a positive influence in the black community into just another medium for the thugs, drug dealers and other losers to use to perpetuate the worthless and empty lifestyles they wish to glamorize. <br /> <br />50 cent is no different than any other that came before him. Just like Tupac, just like EZ, just like Ludacris. They may use (i.e. steal) different backtracks/loops and go by a different alias', but they all preach the same thing. \\"B*i*tches\\", \\"Boom\\", \\"Blunts\\", \\"Booty\\" and \\"Bling\\". <br /> <br />They want to claim \\"freedom of speech\\", but they abuse it with filth like this and encourage the youth to \\"get yours\\" and \\"F the MF's that are hatin'\\" and all that other brilliant intellectual philosophy. \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin'\\", 50 cent's new \\"movie\\" had no redeeming value whatsoever. Listen dude, nobody cares, OK? Only uneducated, self-serving lowlife's like yourself and dumb, rich white kids who, for some stupid reason, wish they were \\"gangsta's\\". <br /> <br />May rap/hip-hop die quickly and leave the music-making to real musicians. <br /> <br />50 cent? Nah...I wouldn't give him 1 cent. <br />

B000BJS4TO|5.0|Adversity is like a strong wind...it doesn't just hold us back from places we might otherwise go. It also tears away from us all but the things that cannot be torn, so that afterward, we see ourselves as we really are, and not merely as we might like to be. ~Memoirs of a Geisha<br /><br />John Williams has created a soundscape of haunting proportions with melancholy sweeps turning into magnificent explorations of creativity. Deep drum beats contrast with delicate instruments, all mingling into a romantic soul-stirring ancient dream with moments of intense hope and mystery.<br /><br />Chiyo's Prayer is delicate in beauty and sharp contrast with Becoming a Geisha introducing more dramatic moments and concluding with an intense flourish. Finding Satsu is a heart-capturing melody interspersed with sharp sweeps and melancholy orchestral pools of sound from which danger seems to lurk.<br /><br />The Chairman's Waltz featuring magical cellist Yo-Yo Ma is delicate and romantic in its sorrowful moments. Rooftops presents mystery and magical moments of suspense. The Garden Meeting is literally drenched in musical contemplation, moody, hopeful and heart wrenching all at once.<br /><br />Confluence is ecstatic and spine tingling in beauty. Each musical discovery is encased in a sense of perfection and care. The moods range from comforting and romantic to dramatic and awakening. As memorable as your deepest love, as haunting as all you have left in your past.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
B0007Y08IS|1.0|the Directors&Writers of this Movie must have something on the Studio CEO Who Green Lighted this Piece of Junk because I can't see this Film even getting sold on bargin day at a dollar store.it's just One big film for shock value&no value or humor whatsoever. this Movie was Stanky&Wack. Bland¬ funny at all.
B0000AFQS0|5.0|This documentary is worth owning for the early live footage alone.  Any Who performance with a young and energetic Keith Moon is positively incendiary.  Highlights include Woodstock excerpts (with Pete on top of his game) and the immortal performance of \\"A Quick One\\" from the Rock and Roll Circus.  This is probably the most staggering live rock performance ever captured on tape.  I would give my right arm to have been there in person.  The later stuff is occasionally embarrassing, but always entertaining.  All in all, probably the best rockumentary there ever has been (along with This is Spinal Tap and No Direction Home).  The lack of a cohesive narrative only adds to the spirit of mayhem.  No complaints about the stellar DVD special edition.
B00025ETIW|5.0|That is how good these guys are.  So good in fact that I think I fell in love for about a week.  Concert was amazing.  These guys put on a hell of a show.  I will be listening to/downloading their first CD just to see what I was missing before \\"Three Cheers\\" came out.   <br /> <br />Highly recommend to anyone with a frontal lobe and to people who appreciate kick ass music without the whole \\"I want to worship satan\\" thing... <br /> <br />Looking forward to their DVD and the new CD...possibly in '06?

B00006CXSS|5.0|After watching a bootleg copy of someone's taped cable episodes and missing the final 4 episodes, I waited months for this to come out. <br /> <br />Not only is this an amazing true story of WWII heroes (thank you to my Grandparents who sacrificed) it is so well done it brings tears to your eyes and cheers as you watch Easy Co. go from bootcamp to Hitler's retreat. <br /> <br />If you are a fan of military or war movies, this is a must-have for your collection.  Each episode is excellent and can be watched alone but you will get addicted quickly!  The real-life accounts of the surviving members of Easy company will bring tears to your eyes and make you want to hug every veteran you meet.  This is a great deal, I bought it for around $85 when it first came out.
B000AP04EW|5.0|This movie was great!!  It was so much fun to watch, my brother and I weren't expecting so much out of it- but were surprisingly amazed.  The acting was really good and the stunts were fun to watch.  \\"Who's your daddy now?\\" was the funniest part to me, but there were lots of great parts to the movie, don't miss this one!
B0009HLDFU|5.0|I never paid much attention to the Foo Fighters until earlier this year. In June 2005 they released \\"In Your Honor,\\" their fifth studio album which peaked at No.2 in both the US and the UK, becoming the biggest album in terms of first-week sales of the band's career. The Foo Fighters always seemed a little too heavy for me, but I went along and bought the album anyway and have ended up absolutely loving it! The fact that this album contains two discs is also great, because you get 21 songs for the price of a normal CD. It's a concept album of sorts, with the first disc focusing on the 'loud' stuff and the second disc focused on the 'not so loud' songs - in other words, one rock, one soft rock. The idea works very well, and even though I found it daunting trying to listen to 21 songs by a band I was never really interested in, the results have been rewarding and I now consider this album one of 2005's best releases.<br /><br />The album opens with the title track, \\"In Your Honor.\\" This is a great introductory song, it starts off distant and epic, before getting closer and breaking free with a crazy chorus. The lyrics are profound and seem to build up towards something: the rest of this mammoth album. \\"No Way Back\\" is one of my favourite songs. It has a very funky guitar solo and the rip will really stick in your head! The lyrics are pretty cool, and the way they are composed is very catchy. The album's first single, \\"Best Of You,\\" is a very powerful piece of rock, both sonically and emotionally. Grohl's vocals are brilliant as they usually are, and the chorus is so catchy, the verses almost idyllic. \\"DOA\\" was the second single from the album, and is another really brilliant song. The verses are very catchy and the guitars are hyper. The drum work in this song impresses me inparticular. \\"Hell\\" is a short song that is followed by the superb \\"The Last Song.\\" This song is superb, and the way the vocals mould brilliantly around Grohl's voice at the start is always a delight. The drum work is very prominent too.<br /><br />\\"Free Me\\" is perhaps my favourite song on the album, it's just so crazy! The guitar work in this song's chorus is absolutely mental, and I adore it with a passion! Grohl's vocals are also incredibly powerful in the middle of the song. \\"Resolve\\" sounds more like old Foo Fighters, with a heavier sound and some brilliant guitar work. The lyrics are pretty cool too. \\"The Deepest Blues Are Black\\" is another good song, but not one of my favourites. \\"End Over End\\" is pretty much the same as the last song, because it only just succeeds in making me remember it. It's not a brilliant song, but then I suppose it's not a bad one either. I also think this song is too long, at just under six minutes in length. The first disc closes with \\"The Sign.\\" This is thankfully a better song, and the guitar work is so evocative in the verses. I find this a very powerful song, quite Nirvana-ish yet still unique.<br /><br />The second disc opens with the beautiful \\"Still.\\" It takes quite a bit for this song to really get going, but once it does you can relax and let this song take you away. The vocals are beautiful, as are the lyrics, while the whole atmosphere that this song creates is one of wisdom and seriousness. \\"What If I Do?\\" is probably the best song on this second disc. It's very clever and well-arranged, I love the chorus and especially the repetition of \\"Carolina!\\" after the third minute. Grohl clearly knows how to construct a song properly. \\"Miracle\\" is another brilliant song with a catchy chorus that will stick in your head for quite some time - believe me, it gets quite annoying when you can't get it out of your head! \\"Another Round\\" is quite suggestive if you have a dirty mind, but other than that it's another really great song! \\"Friend Of A Friend\\" was written by Grohl some 15 years ago, and is a song about his new friends at the time, Cobain and Novoselic. People are interested in this song just because it's about Kurt Cobain and Grohl's perspective of him from way back when, but it's actually a really brilliant song that reminds me of Nirvana's \\"Polly\\" or \\"Dumb.\\"<br /><br />\\"Over And Out\\" is yet another brilliant song, it's quite epic and has a drum beat that rides along majestically like a horse. The lyrics are really cool and tell a story of searching for someone that you can no longer find: pretty heartbreaking at times. \\"On The Mend\\" is another pretty cool song where the guitar is light and wistful, dominating above everything else. It isn't the strongest song here, but it still holds up against the rest. \\"Virginia Moon\\" is one of my favourites, because it features Norah Jones on guest vocals, and she complements Grohl's rough and sexy voice perfectly. The song itself is very old-style and classic-sounding, and would fit in well on one of Norah's albums because the piano that she plays is just all her own! \\"Cold Day In The Sun\\" is a good song but not one of my favourites, because it sounds a bit loud for this not so loud disc! I feel that it kind of ruins the tone a bit, but not to worry, because the album closes with \\"Razor,\\" which is a stunning song. The guitar work on this song is evocative, and pretty much razor-sharp when you first hear it. It kind of creeps up behind you, and trots out perfectly.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 9/10<br /><br />I didn't expect to love this album from the Foo Fighters so much, so I've been very surprised and delighted. I definitely see myself purchasing more albums from the band in the next few months. I'd also like to express my disappointment at Sony, and the disgusting way they have treated fans of the band and loyal music buyers by installing all that junk on your hard drive once you put this album in your computer. However, I'm reviewing the music, so I haven't let that detract from my opinion of the actual music like some others have. Plus, my copy of the album seemed to copy fine to my computer - maybe the UK version is different to the US one, who knows. I definitely recommend this album to anyone interested in one of the best rock albums of the year. Probably one of the most consistent albums I've heard in a long time.e of him from way back when, but it's actually a really brilliant song that reminds me of Nirvana's \\"Polly\\" or \\"Dumb.\\"    \\"Over And Out\\" is yet another brilliant song, it's quite epic and has a drum beat that rides along majestically like a horse.

B000AU9UYC|5.0|This was a really good movie... my brother and my dad even liked it which is unusual.. they are very hard critics to please.  Good stuff!
B000BVD460|4.0|this is greatest hits not a best of so the dope album tracks are left out(and a few of the singles too).i dont need to buy this cos i got his albums(id advise getting slim shady and marshall mathers lps and infinite if you can) but the new tracks are interesting. when im gone is a song about neglecting his family for rap and explaining his decision to quit basically.shake that is like another forgettable club track with nate on the hook, and fack is probably the most disturbing song i ever heard(even more than necro, brotha lynch hung and the like) which ends with him singing \\"shove a gerbil in your azz through a tube\\". youve got to wonder how the SAME guy gives the most serious song of his career(when im gone) then makes this. i think dude is disturbed and hes past it, maybe its good that he quit, his first 2 albums (and infinite) were classic, eminem show was straight azz crack and badly produced, and encore he returns to form, although its not a classic by any means.
0765340798|3.0|Much like I thought for the first prequel triology, the Legends of Dune series concludes with a third story that doesn't quite wrap up the story, leaving large, vital chunks of the story in limbo. <br /> <br />This series, however, ends on a worse note than the first. Unlike the first series, few of the characters here have shown any development, expect for the robot Erasmus. Second, almost all of the plot follows a confining, this, then that format, allowing for very little natural flow to the story or suspense. <br /> <br />I found the Battle of Corrin to be another major disappointment, especially the supposed cowardice of Abulurd Harkonnen. Instead of a coward, he comes off as a tragic hero, and his hatred of the Atriedes seems justified. <br /> <br />I suppose now Herbert and Anderson will work on the alleged Dune 7 found in the notes belonging to Frank Herbert. I can only hope they'll do better.
B0009WK5D6|4.0|When i first saw this I wasn't sure if it would be good but after seeing it I think that this is one of the best teen movies before not another teen movie. I Recommend renting it before buying it though. I have not seen the unrated version but i think it has more nudity then the original but i say go out in but some peaple might think its funny and some people might think its stupid and crude so thats why i say rent it before buying it.
B0007N1AI6|2.0|I'm 41,grew up on priest and the last album-yes album -I bought was defenders of the faith. Once I heard turbo lover I knew the end was near,or at least it was for me.I spent the last 10 or so years saying they need to get Halford back again. The same way I've been saying Van Halen needs David Lee roth as much as he needs them.  So after reading reviews here,I took the chance and bought the disc.  Its really brings back memories of the good old days. The guitars and vocals are as good as ever and I actually hear a bass guitar for a change! I like the \\"new\\" drummer better than the old guy too. If you like the real judas priest-buy it you won't be sorry.The added dvd feature is very cool for a disc thats priced barely higher than a regular cd. get the dual disc and get back to heavy metal the way it should be--judas priest!!!!I only gave ot four stars because although the material is new,it is a bit predictable,typical priest sound and arrangements-although its not as bad as a carbon copy like the many ac/dc albums-otherwise it would get a five star rating.
1563894696|3.0|I finally got around to reading this one, having long heard it touted as a worthy follow-up to Frank Miller and  David Mazzucchelli's stunning masterpiece, _Batman: Year One_.<br /><br />It's a follow-up, all right, but I'm not persuaded that it's a completely worthy one. Jeph Loeb gets some of it right, but he fritters away Batman's second year in business with quite a bit of silliness. Are we, for example, to believe that Batman encountered this much of his \\"rogue's gallery\\" during this one case? The only one that gets any real \\"screen time\\" is Catwoman, and she's well handled for the most part. But the rest are just trivialized away. And was Batman out of commission for the entire time he was under Poison Ivy's influence? If not, what did he do during that time?<br /><br />I'm also not a huge fan of Tim Sale's art. Some of the panels are very nicely rendered, but what's up with e.g. the Joker and his eighty-eight five-inch teeth?<br /><br />What made Miller and Mazzuchelli's masterpiece work was its utterly consistent aura of gritty realism. Loeb and Sale have pushed Batman back in a more \\"cartoony\\" direction -- with a somewhat noir-Gothic edge, but without the crisp, economical storytelling that made its predecessor such a resounding success and certainly without the same earthy approach to Batman's origins and capabilities.<br /><br />To make matters worse, the world's greatest detective doesn't even successfully _solve_ the mystery at hand. Despite the good-on-the-whole handling of Harvey Dent's transformation into Two-Face, the central story -- the mystery itself -- is bungled by both Batman and the author, who hands the reader (and not Batman!) a totally gratuitous \\"surprise\\" payoff with essentially no basis in the storyline to that point.<br /><br />It's pretty good on the whole, but it's far from great. I'll follow up by reading _Dark Victory_ and _Haunted Knight_ just to see whether they improved. But I don't like this stuff anywhere near as well as I liked Denny O'Neil's 1970s-era Batman, let alone Miller's brilliant work.<br /><br />By the way, _Batman Begins_ fans will also want to read this as one of the sources Christopher Nolan and David Goyer consulted for their excellent screenplay. Just don't expect this to be of the same quality as the movie.alone Miller's brilliant work.    By the way, _Batman Begins_ fans will also want to read this as one of the sources Christopher Nolan and David Goyer consulted for their excellent screenplay. Just don't expect this to be of the same quality as the movie.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Well I had this delivered today.  I was very nervous about getting a/some defective disks from reading many of the reviews.  When I opened it, all the disks were in their holders so I was happy, figuring the disks would be ok.  The \\"first\\" movie on the \\"first\\" disk that I tried to watch...you guessed it, defective...sigh.  You'd think from all of these reports of damage that they'd do something about it, but I guess they really don't care since anyone who buys this item is an Alien freak and will buy it anyway.  Oh well... The set is great of course, I'm just very disappointed and hoping I can get a replacement before Christmas.  The 5 stars are for content.
0684824906|5.0|Pulitzer Prize winner Dr. Goodwin has penned a masterpiece.  <br /> <br />I guess that you can call it a biography as it certainly covers Lincoln's life. Or perhaps you could call it a multiple biography as it covers the lives of so many other people. I tend to think of it instead as a history of the leadership of the Union during the Civil War.  <br /> <br />Lincoln clearly had a hard time finding a general to take the war where he thought it should go, just as clearly he made a series of brilliant choices in his selection of a cabinet. Surprisingly the key players were all people who thought that they were better than Lincoln, indeed most of them had run for the nomination themselves. Over time, a surprisingly short time, they then turned to give Lincoln great support and to revise their opinions as to his character and capabilities.  <br /> <br />Most of the other books on either Lincoln or the War treat these people almost as furniture, they were there but nothing is said of what they did. As this book makes clear, they were also very capable, competent men. The Union was assured of a solid Government behind the generals that were trying to create a functioning army.  <br /> <br />This book is my suggestion for another Pulitzer Prize to Dr. Goodwin.
6304696566|5.0|John Wayne was big. There's an urban legend that he worked tirelessly to get James Arness the starring role in the new TV series \\"Gunsmoke\\" because Arness was one of the few actors actually bigger physically than the Duke and Wayne didn't want any competition in that department on the silver screen.<br /><br />The time is 1868. The Civil War less than three years ended. Wayne returns, a Confederate soldier, to his brother's ranch out west. Here is Wayne at his best, not a nice Wayne, not a compassionate Wayne, not a friendly Wayne but one seeking retribution for the murder of his brother and his brother's family by the indians. He sets his code, his raison d'etre if you will, and sticks to it. Speaking of one of his nieces killed in the indian raid, he says to the two young men with him, Jeffrey Hunter (before Christ) and Harey Carey, Jr, \\"I buried her in my jacket. And as long as you live don't ask me about it again.\\"<br /><br />Revisionist's say it's John Ford's indictment of racism but I have found it to be more of a caveat to the all consumptive power of hatred. My favorite Wayne is still Whistling Dan from the 'High and the Mighty' but this is the best Wayne and also even considering Shane and the Unforgiven, the best western. 5 Stars. Larry Scantlebury

B000BMSTMS|5.0|to tell you the truth i am a hypocrite because i am korns biggest fan. but when i listen to this album it reminds me of \\"life is peachy\\" and \\"issues\\". the writing and producing on this album is amazing and of course the band is too. jonathon and his voice you think you get use to but on this album i feel it more because it seems hes reaching in his back pocket and letting it go again like before.like there was any left after the first 6 albums. but the band shows they are more alive than ever and is showing the world that you can still dream and accomplish whatever you set your mind on.korn rules still!!! i love u jonathon woooo......
B000B2YQX4|5.0|i am such a huge Depeche Mode fan, and this album is wonderful. Just saw them live again last night and was almost in tears. They just don't come like this very much any more. Precious is an fantastic single, the whole album being very dark and moody like true DM style. I love Gore's track as much Gahans, though Dave's voice is hard to beat.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|The little TV show that didn't grows up into the little movie that could....wow audiances that is! Great characters, mystery and action combine with a wild west attitude and futuristic flair. A truly unique and enjoyable movie.
B000AYQLX6|5.0|My personal favorite John Lennon album is 1974's \\"Walls And Bridges,\\" which may seem like an odd choice to some people since the album is considered to be one of John's \\"weakest\\" releases (and recorded during John's \\"lost weekend\\" period, when he was separated from Yoko Ono). Personally, I don't understand the criticism at all. \\"Walls And Bridges\\" a \\"weak\\" album? Nonsense! Whatever personal problems Lennon was going through during this period, I think he still cranked out a fantastic album. Mind you, I enjoy all of John's solo stuff, including such classics as \\"Plastic Ono Band,\\" \\"Imagine,\\" and his songs on \\"Double Fantasy,\\" but there's just something about \\"Walls And Bridges\\" that appeals to me the most. What else can I say? I think the songs, the production, and of course, John's singing and songwriting is just wonderful on this disc. There are memorable melodies and performances throughout \\"Walls And Bridges.\\" Great songs include \\"Going Down On Love,\\" the #1 hit \\"Whatever Gets You Through The Night\\" (featuring Elton John), the jazz-rock throwdown \\"What You Got,\\" the gorgeous feel of \\"Bless You,\\" the atmospheric dreamscapes of \\"#9 Dream,\\" the powerful \\"Steel And Glass,\\" the funky instrumental \\"Beef Jerky,\\" and the classic Lennon ballad \\"Nobody Loves You (When You're Down And Out)\\". These songs are absolutely amongst Lennon's best work, so don't tell me that this album is weak. If I'm alone in my opinion that \\"Walls And Bridges\\" is the best solo album Lennon ever recorded, then so be it. Maybe I'm just weird. But I totally love John Lennon's \\"Walls And Bridges\\" and I always have. I hope you will, too.
B000BMSTMS|5.0|So finally after the long year of waiting, the time has come and new KoRn is out....well what can i say...its left me speechless and impressed...ive just sunk deep into this music and used the key they have given me to go on the other side to meet other beings just like me looking for something different in this wasted music land. Ive lost in KoRn realms and dont want to come back...heres my home...full of magic, emotions, wonderful music that can come only streight from the heart ( when you check the art book of DeLuxe ld edition you will know what im talking about). SYOTOS has put a spell on my world and since ive got it i cant stop listening to it... i cant even list my favortes songs becouse when i try pick some, others come on my mind and from list consisting 4 songs becmes list consisting all 14 (17) tracks..This new sound...industial, electronical puts KoRn on another level and makes them stay still ahead of others..they dont care about the kind (name) of the sound they make...they are beyond it...they just do what they feel...and this is whats make them so special. They dont afraid of experimenting and never stays in the same music point as many other bands in a fear of losing fans. KoRn knows that it can relay on its fans, the most loylal fans ever, its not the number of sold records what counts the most for them but fans..always its been this way, thats why we love them so much. If money were counting for them the most they wouldnt be risking with going into new sound that some fans might not like, but they would be doing what is already well known and checked. But they didnt do that and we owe them respect for their courage to try something new. There are several kinds of tracks and i suppose everyone can find something for himself. Well ill try do what is impossible that is pick some tracks to tell somethong more about it. Love Song its an amasing song...industrial sound, variable tempo and the amasing way Jonathan Davis sings...aspecially during chours,you can concider it as a kind of rock/metal ballad...very said one. Another one i want to mention is Seen It All..propably bands favorite as the rumors say. And i can fully understand it..amasing song. Youve never heared something like that before...its simple but in the same time its complicated in its simpleness...you cant say if its quick or slow but it cames into your head and makes you want to listen to it again and again to enjoy every part of this long *more than 6min)song. There are many effects and weird instruments and piano in the midddle when Jonathan sings words that inspired the records cover \\"Im just a child/with tears in its eyes/Im holding this gift?that is broken/what do i have left now\\". The last one im gonna tell you about is ending track Tearjerker..wellthe tittle speaks for itself..i bet youll be crying while listening to it....its the most sad song ive ever heared and its beautiful. Wonderful music full of melody, the most melodic KoRn track, very slow, almost with no guitar, bass and drums which appears at the end of the song but with ohter, electronic and weird instrument sounds and piano as well. It makes this song so special, sad and depressing...words telling very sad story and the way Jonthan sings it can be a little surprise...but in positive sense. I cant imagine a person who wont like this song at least. Im proud of being KoRn fan..and im happy with their newest child. I wanna invite you all on the other side if you still arent there....
B0000013G9|5.0|What can be said about CSC that hasn't already been said: \\"an album that defined an era,\\" \\"tlc's best,\\" \\"a funky blend of pop, r&b, gospel and Prince.\\" CSC is tlc's most consistent album. I originally bought this album on tape in Dec. 1994 as a Christmas gift to myself. Now, I have the cd too, and it's an album I'll always want in my collection even though I no longer listen to it religiously. <br /> <br />There's so much good about this album, but unfortunately it isn't perfect. There are a touch too many interludes. I'll admit each interlude is relevant in explaining the whole crazy sexy cool thing, but I don't appreciate T-boz referring to herself as a ho in one of them. Especially considering years later on Fanmail she would make not one but two songs declaring she's not a ho. The interlude with Busta Rhymes is too long, and I almost always skip it. Listen to Missy Elliot's ...So Addictive Cd and see doesn't the Busta on the interlude thing  scream \\"copied from tlc.\\" <br /> <br />Diggin On You was a song I never really liked. It's slightly corny, but it was a top 5 hit, and you can't argue with success, can you? Nevertheless, I still don't like it and I usually skip it. <br /> <br />Case of the Fake People is not a BAD song, just ordinary. It's boring really, and I usually skip this one too. <br /> <br />Case and Diggin are the two tracks that make my rating a 4.5 rather than a 5. The rest of the songs are incredible and I actually listen more to the songs that WEREN'T singles, especially Take Our Time, which is the most underrated song on the album. Chilli is a tad dirty on it, but not trashy. <br /> <br />If I Was Your Girlfriend seems to spark a little controversy with the fans. Most don't like it and find it unnecessary, but I love it. I'm a big Prince fan, and Girlfriend is my favorite song from him; so to have my favorite musical act cover it was devine. Tlc's version is not as good as Prince's but they make it their own. Prince and Chilli allegedly started dating while tlc was touring for CSC. Maybe Prince was A LOT more impressed than the average fan :) <br /> <br />Am I the only one who thinks the interlude song that opens the album and separates Waterfalls from Let's Do It Again could and should have been a full length song? It's GOOD. <br /> <br />The era of CSC was slightly uncertain. Many of us were worried whether tlc could continue after the fire, or whether Lisa would have to go to jail. I was only 13 at the time and didn't even realize tlc were at their zenith and that the world was eating up tlc's style and talent. They were everywhere, yet I couldn't fully appreciate it because of my youthfulness. 1995 was tlc's alone. I wish it could have lasted.
B000002GYR|4.0|Ok, good, but not as good as the heart of saturdy night.  Alright, The only difference betwen these two albums is that one of them is much more sting oriented and \\"closing time\\" is more of a guitar based singer songwriter album.  Waits' biggest strengths on this and any other album is the ammount of jazz ad strings in the music and he only gives about 3 songs with good orchestration.  The Cd isnot greatly produced but it doesn't really matter.  \\"Ice Cream man\\" is thye only real unoriginal song on this album.  What is fantastic is  Wait's voice which is a lot better than it was later.  Not exactley the definitive early album, but still a damn good one.  By \\"Heart of Saturday night first\\" but buy  this soon after.
B00025ETIW|5.0|I've been hesitant to write a review for 3 Cheers..., since there  are so many, and this would just be another in an ocean of reviews which are going to be overlooked, but now it's time to say what I want: I am one of those fans who have been listening to MCR for a few years now, and was totally caught off guard when they started the MTV appearances. The truth is they deserve it. It's not like they didn't have history before they got big, they've paid their dues. When I bought this the day it came out one and a half years ago, I expected the production to be more polished since they moved to a bigger label (not necessarily a bad thing). From the first moment of tremlo picked clean guitar intro of Helena, I was completely hooked. The album is full of exciting, fast paced pop/punk/metal/emo/arena/whatever, goodness. Ray Toro got to show off his playing chops, and I've always liked Gerard Way (though the lyrics are a little watered down). I like every song, but Cemetery Drive, and Thank You for Your Venom are superb. I prefer the first album; I thought it was a lot \\"darker\\" (goth if you must). This is definately one of my favorite \\"pop\\" (I hate that word for some reason) albums.
B00005NKKV|3.0|This album is a lot like the first album of Simon and Garfunkel.  Of course, it has the great hits like the title track, I am  a Rock, and Kathy's song, but the rest is pretty bland and inconsistent.  The remastering has done little to help.  Besides the highly successful tunes, nothing is really that great.  Also, as an album, it doesn't seem like song order and production really matter.  I would recommend all of the other album's before this because they are absolutely amazing.  You might also consider the greatest hits album which carries the 3 most popular tracks.  As an album this one just gets too boring after a bit.
B000AARKOO|3.0|The story line tells of a man who was a lord in the Levant who returns to France for his long lost son, brings him to Jerusalem where the father dies, the son takes his place, and Jerusalem falls to Sala-al-din, and the people are saved by the son's cunning and kindness.<br /><br />I watched this movie through, and I want to remind my readers that the only historically accurate information here is that Hollywood does tend to take a story, base it in some kind of historical reference, add to it for romance, action and how well it will fit into 145 minutes.<br /><br />I want to say that taken as an entertainment, and not for historical value, the movie was entertaining.  I liked the interpretation of Balian by Orlando Bloom.  Actually, Orlando Bloom was nice to see as other than some hunky cheesecake on the screen.  He may actually have an acting career if he continues to take parts that require him to act.  He did a good job here, and for an overall period piece on the Crusades, I would give this movie 3 and a half stars.  It's a bit better than average, but the lack of accurate history takes one star off the top, and a few of the \\"goofs\\" in the movie take another half star.  It was worth sitting through, it is nicely done with the costumes and the scenery, and overall, the major events are somewhat accurate.<br /><br />The choice of the lead character, Balian, was a good one on Hollywood's part, as he is treated well by the history books as one who was respected by both the royal court in Jerusalem as well as the Moslems.  Balian was in the rear guard at the battle of Hattin, and was allowed by Sala-al-din to return to Jerusalem to remove his wife and children before Sala-al-din was to seige it.  The rest of the story is pretty much true.  Balian threatens to kill all and destroy Jerusalem unless there is some truce reached.  What is not told is that Sala-al-din allows everyone to leave provided they pay a \\"ransom\\".  The lords do ransom themselves out, as do the clergy, but the Templars and the Hospitalers leave all the poor folks high and dry, and Balian pays what he can for the balance of the people to leave, which by the way, was most of the population of Jerusalem.  Sala-al-din releases the balance without ransom, allows them 40 days to depart, and escorts them all to the sea.<br /><br />The story is Hollywood, woven around some actual facts.  There are a few goofs in details, some key facts just left out, some romance spun around to make the movie more palatable to some.  The battle scenes are done well, much gore splashing around, no lack of blood and gutts.  Probably what got this film an R rating, as I see it.  There is no \\"sex\\" to speak of except for a brief love scene, which is very short and discrete.  I am glad to see they did not make Sala-al-din out to be the bad guy in the bunch.  There were enough bad guys in the Crusaders court to hold the story together.  No one was spotless, and the movie goes that route.<br /><br />If you want something that is entertaining with a Crusader theme, this is a good choice.  If you are looking for historical facts, they are not really here.  Orlando Bloom really does act in this film, proving he can be more than just eye candy.  Liam Neeson is excellent as ever, as Balian' father.  Jeremy Irons as the trusted Tiberias was an interesting character as well.<br /><br />Enjoy the movie for what it is - entertainment.  Look to the history books for actual history.  This is the Hollywood rendition of the Crusades and the Fall of Jerusalem, and they tell it in the best entertaining way they can.  Facts get in the way of plot, and actors are chosen not because they are accurate in their  appearance, but because they are good at playing a part and big names attract attention.  If you take this into consideration, then you will enjoy this film.  And, of course, you have to be interested in the Crusades.  medievalcrusadesbabethe clergy, but the Templars and the Hospitalers leave all the poor folks high and dry, and Balian pays what he can for the balance of the people to leave, which by the way, was most of the population of Jerusalem.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|I have never been a huge Madonna fan.  She's got some good songs but not my thing.  That was until this Cd came out.  I brought the Cd from amazon.com because I got addicted to Hung Up, only to fall in love with the cd.  WITHOUT A DOUBT, this is the best CD ever made.  Madonna has excelled herself. <br /> <br />Highlights of the Cd for me are Hung Up, How High, Sorry, Let It Will be, Get Together, Jump and Like it Or Not.  Push and Isaac I have to be in the mood for, but this is a great cd to drive around town with it full volume.  It's non stop dance and I totally love it!  <br /> <br />As a non madonna fan, seriously by it.  It'll win a tonne of grammys in 2007!
B00005JMEW|5.0|Both Volumes of \\"Kill Bill\\" are highly entertaining. I find this one even more entertaining than the second. It's got excess, gore, violence, neck-breakign pace, amazing scenery, cultural diversity, witty dialogue, terrific acting, beautiful women.... In other words, this movie delivers the whole package.  <br />Some critics attacked the story line as a weak link. I do not agree. The story is strong enough to keep the movie together and allow it to deliver on all of the things I just mentioned. The non-chronological development turned out to be a plus in this case. <br /> <br />I give preference to this Volume over the second Volume of Kill Bill, because direct confrontations between the Bride and her enemies are more colorful, more action-filled and in general more entertaining than in this first Volume. The confrontation between the Bride and Vernita Green and later between the Bride and Crazy 88 and Orin Ishii are unmatched in their color, movement and other aethetic values in the second Volume.  <br /> <br />The Director achieved a perfect synthesis of American action/adventure with his tribute to Asian cinema, with his fascination for and love of women and violence.
B00004WIDR|1.0|This movie is absolute torture. The characters use repetitive profanity, and do a lot of stupid things. The \\"eco-terrorists\\" are the heroes in this one. They free the dinosaurs from their cages and cause a massive loss of life. LAME! Stephen Spielberg's first movies were ok, but in this one he has become a liberal fanatic. He does not even think that human life is anything more sacred than that of a man-eating tyrannosaurus rex. I especially hated the ending, it was incredibly STUPID and LAME! Come on Hollywood, you're better than this.
B00005JMUA|5.0|The bride, whose name is revealed to be Beatrix Kiddo, continues her quest to settle the secore with the Deadly Vipers Assassination Squad and to get to their leader, her ex lover, Bill. Volume 2 is not as fast-paced and not quite as colorful as thte Volume 1. But it is great nevertheless. In this Volume the Bride is burried alive, digs herself out, snatches out another eye (in Vol.1 it was an eye of some anonymous Japanese man of Crazy 88; this time it's Elle's remaining eye). She then manages to get to Bill and makes a stunning discovery about her daughter. Bill waxes philosophical and indirectly tells us what this whole movie is -- an comic book come to life. Then there is a final showdown between Bill and the Bride in which Pai Mei's five-point palm, exploding heart technique is used--a maneuver that the great Kung Fu master Pai Mei never taught to anyone, according to Bill. There are no surpising twists and the viewer senses that the outcome is never really in doubt, not even when the Bride is burried alive, but the acting and the visuals carry this work to a cinematic high.
B000BTJCRM|5.0|This is truly an amazing debut album from the sydney rockers. It has a very 70's Sabbath style sound and rocks from start to finish. This disc only helps cemment thier status as a true rock band, after viewing their live show. <br />The opener \\"Colossal\\" belts out the vibe for the remainder of the cd, solid, balls to the floor rock n roll. <br />Highlights include the new & revamped \\"Woman\\" my favourite track, also \\"Joker & The Thief\\", \\"Pyramid\\" and a very Led Zepp sounding \\"Witchcraft\\". <br />The only weekness i see about this release is that every track from the previous EP is included on the album, and they dont sound as good as the originals. <br />Overall Wolfmothers debut release is an instant classic and is definantly aan essential in the collection. If you like Jet & Supergrass - the new / old rock style, then pick this up, and if you dig Zep and Sabbath, you should already have this.
B00005JO04|4.0|\\"Syriana\\", writer/ director Stephen Gaghan's follow-up to his Oscar winning screenplay for \\"Traffic\\", is an involving, complicated look at the oil industry. It is a very good film, but you are going to have to work at it, paying attention to every moment, in order to keep track of all of the characters, events and manipulation being depicted.<br /><br />Bob (George Clooney), an undercover agent, sells two missiles to a contact in Iran. One of the missiles is promptly taken away by an unknown second party., the other weapon explodes as the man who purchased it, drives away. Bryan Woodman (Matt Damon) works for a small investment firm in Geneva, Switzerland. His firm is trying to become the advisors for the aging, ready to retire Emir and his two ambitious sons. Bryan, his wife, Julie (Amanda Peet) and their two sons are invited to the Emir's birthday party in Mallorca, Spain. After tragedy befalls his family, Bryan's company wins the coveted contract advising the Emir's oldest son. Bennett Holliday (Jeffrey Wright), a lawyer with a Washington, DC firm, is put in charge of scrutinizing the impending merger of two large oil firms, one of which is owned by Jimmy Pope (Chris Cooper), a good old Texas boy who doesn't seem to really want the merger. Dean Whiting (Christopher Plummer), a high level advisor in the government, quietly pulls strings to make sure the \\"right\\" son becomes the new Emir.<br /><br />All of these characters are involved in seemingly different storylines, and they don't really interact for a significant portion of the film. As you watch a few moments with Clooney in Iran, Beirut or Baltimore or a few moments with Damon in Geneva, Mallorca or the desert, Gaghan helps us to learn a little about these characters and their involvement in a story with a huge scope, spanning many countries around the globe. Towards the end when the storylines begin to overlap, and all of the machinations begin to make sense, you get the sense that the director has prepared us well, or as well as anyone could, to understand how all of these different people, all of these different factors, are involved in the story.<br /><br />Gaghan, whose debut directorial effort was the rightfully ignored thriller \\"Abandoned\\" starring Benjamin Bratt and Katie Holmes, follows that up with this epic about the oil industry. Gaghan works very hard to keep the audience in the loop, helping them keep track of characters, the locations and the action. In many ways, it is very similar to \\"Traffic\\"; multiple characters, multiple locations, storylines that don't necessarily overlap. Gaghan seems to have adopted the style of Steven Soderbergh, the director of \\"Traffic\\". There is a lot of handheld camera work, to create a sense of immediacy and closeness to all of the action. Thankfully, as Gaghan introduces the various characters, type appears on screen identifying their location, helping us stay grounded in the action, helping us keep track. If you liked \\"Traffic\\", you should also appreciate this new film. If not, stay away. I know that a lot of handheld camera work can drive some people batty, but in this case, it really works well in service of the story.<br /><br />If even half of the manipulations presented in this film are based on actual truth, it is no wonder the oil industry is so filled with corruption. The people who control this industry are wealthy beyond our comprehension and they want to make sure we stay that way and are willing to do anything, including changing the course of another country's government, covering up covert arm sales, hiding bribes, etc.<br /><br />As the film moves from one character to the next, one location to another across the globe, and introduces more and more people, we begin to recognize there is a common thread throughout; everyone is greedy. Some of the people don't necessarily start out that way, but they are soon corrupted. The greedier they are in the beginning, the richer they are in the end. The most interesting moments, for me, are when a couple of characters give in to their greed, and the audience realizes this for the first time. The way they give in to this temptation is quite shocking and memorable.<br /><br />With such a large ensemble, and each of the major stars on screen for less than thirty minutes or so, it is difficult for them to create a performance that is anything more than serviceable to the story. This isn't a bad thing, but people who are expecting George Clooney and Matt Damon to share a lot of screen time, will be disappointed. Clearly, each of the actors was interested in getting this film made and didn't want to be the \\"star\\". The supporting cast is more successful, simply because they have less baggage accompanying them. If you see Clooney or Damon, you expect them to carry the film. When they don't, it is a little bit of a let down. Chris Cooper, Tim Blake Nelson, Christopher Plummer and Alexander Siddig as Prince Nasir Al-Subaai, the Emir's older son, all leave a memorable impression in a very short period of time.<br /><br />\\"Syriana\\" is a film that is trying to educate us through the medium of drama. It isn't a documentary, but a lot of what is depicted probably has happened or will happen. Because of this, you will probably be more informed, more skeptical the next time you hear a story about an oil company receiving exclusive drilling rights in some far off country, the next time you hear a President from Texas inform the public about the rational behind increasing oil prices or the rational behind going to war in a small country in the Middle East.<br /><br />\\"Syriana\\" is a film worthy of your attention and interest.interesting moments, for me, are when a couple of characters give in to their greed, and the audience realizes this for the first time.

Chris Cooper, Tim Blake Nelson, Christopher Plummer and Alexander Siddig as Prince Nasir Al-Subaai, the Emir's older son, all leave a memorable impression in a very short period of time. <br /> <br />\\"Syriana\\" is a film that is trying to educate us through the medium of drama. It isn't a documentary, but a lot of what is depicted probably has happened or will happen. Because of this, you will probably be more informed, more skeptical the next time you hear a story about an oil company receiving exclusive drilling rights in some far off country, the next time you hear a President from Texas inform the public about the rational behind increasing oil prices or the rational behind going to war in a small country in the Middle East. <br /> <br />\\"Syriana\\" is a film worthy of your attention and interest. <br />
B000AP04FG|5.0|The newly-remade Mr. & Mrs. Smith is quite awesome, both comedically and in an action/adventure sense. <br /> <br />This was much better than I even anticipated. It is quite obvious why Brad and Angelina are together in real life. Their chemistry here is astounding. Both are at the top of their acting game here. From bad-ass assassins to romping sexuallly through sheer force of willpower and muscle - both are shown with aplomb in this film. <br /> <br />Whoever this director is, he is on the right road here. Great action cinematography, along with comedic timing, the director shoots all with pinashe. <br /> <br />A must see film.
B000000OSE|4.0|Use Your Illusion I, along with Use Your Illusion II, was released in 1991 and is Guns N' Roses third studio album.    We all know who Guns N' Roses are, do I need to explain? The bad boys from LA, dangerous, dire Rock N' Roll heroes. At the time UYI were released, the band was hugely famous around the globe - with their massive selling debut Appetite For Destruction and another excellent gem Lies, GN'R managed to build up huge group of fans. No one knew what these guys held for us for their next album. It took over two years to finally complete it, and what is the result? Did GN'R fail or succeed here? The result of their long and exhausting work is an amazing epic masterpiece!    Apparently it wasn't just long and exhausting work that held GN'R from releasing this album. During drawing-out, endless preparations for the final release some of the band's members fell into drug addiction - and these were Slash, Duff and Steven Adler. Slash and Duff managed to clean up from this mess, but Steven didn't - as the result He was fired from the band and replaced by Matt Sorum, drummer from The Cult. Dizzy Reed was also added to support GN'R with piano and keyboard.    After all that facts, let's get into the music. Some fans complain that this album lacks the energy of their raw and raunchy classic Appetite For Destruction. Sure, it's not as raw and unpolished, but it doesn't mean it's bad! In fact, it rocks all the way through. The band focuses a little more on ballads and experimental tunes than on straight-up rockers, but for the most of the part, it works well. Right Next Door To Hell is good opening to the album - while not its strongest track, it makes You hot for the beginning. Other rockin' tunes out there are fast-paced and agressive Perfect Crime and Garden Of Eden. Bad Apples is sleazy bluesy rock that some like, others don't - personally I think it's an excellent track, by the way it used to be one of my favourite GN'R tunes in its time. Dust N' Bones contains memorable lines from Izzy Stradlin about how nasty women are, and some good riffin' is to be found here, too. Beautiful, sad and heartbreaking Don't Cry is an excellent ballad with sensible lyrics and great guitar licks. But the best ballad here, is undoubtedly, the epic November Rain. It starts slowly, but quickly builds up and turns into rock opera. The mood peaks at the end when Slash plays one of the best guitar riffs ever. Absolutely awesome.  Other standouts include the rockers Don't Damn Me, The Garden, Bad Obsession, but every song is worthwhile and You may find many more personal favourites on this album.    Does UYI 1 match UYI 2? Most fans consider UYI 2 as the better part of the two, but for me both these albums are equally great - and Use Your Illusion is not complete without one of them. So do Yourself a favor and buy both of them.    Guns N' Roses did a great job here, and overall it's and excellent album. Must have for fans of the band, but if You're just getting into the band, I suggest getting Appetite For Destruction first. But Don't forget to get Use Your Illusion! Highly recommended!
B000051VWW|5.0|i think any true fan will appreciate any and everything sade put out.i know i do.i wouldn't dare give them under 5 stars on any of their cd,s.i have my favorites on this cd,but i really do appreciate all of their music and their talent combined is just nothing short of brillant.

Dizzy Reed was also added to support GN'R with piano and keyboard.    After all that facts, let's get into the music. With UYI 2, GN'R deliver mostly rocking tunes, but also a couple of ballads and other intersting cuts. Civil War, a haunting and thrilling ballad rocker, kicks off for the beginning and is one of the best on the album. Some other rockin' tunes are the stomping You Could Be Mine, which delivers raw riffin' from Izzy Stradlin and dire guitar licks from Slash, and the agressive Get In The Ring. One of GN'R biggest hits to date, Knockin' On Heavens Door, is to be found here, too. The song was originally recorded by Bob Dylan, but GN'R did a great job covering it, turning it from a simple pop tune into slow, but powerful Rock N' Roll. Slash's guitar work here is killer.  But after it all, the most important track to be found here is Estranged, which is somehow a counterpart of November Rain from UYI 1. Dramatic riffing and the dark atmosphere are thrilling, the change of mood works great, too. Again, Slash's guitar work is amazing. Amazing piece, one of GN'R finest.  Other standouts include the ballad rocker Yesterdays, or beautiful tune So Fine. Most fans complain for appearance of alt. version of Don't Cry, call it a filler. Personally I prefer this version from the original, the lyrics fit better into the mood. By the way, it's a damn good track. Overall, it's an excellent album and though I mentioned only its main highlights, You may find other amazing tunes here.    Is UYI 2 really better than UYI 1? Most fans consider UYI 2 as the better part of the two, but for me both these albums are equally great - and Use Your Illusion is not complete without one of them. So do Yourself a favor and buy both of them.    Guns N' Roses did a great job here, and overall it's and excellent album.

B000BJS4SU|1.0|Hoped this release would be good, all these JM flunkies talkin this thing up got me hopefull it would be great lowdown dirty blues. Well it ain't what it turned out to be , at least for me. John mayer just doesnt have any SOUL!!! Now I dont mean LITERALLY no soul , like he's some kinda demon or something. No the kind of soul im taling about is the kind associated with Marvin Gaye and Albert King and Shuggie Otis and Stevie Wonder etc.etc.etc. As far as that kind of soul....nowhere to be found .,.these blues are so whitebread and plain you might as well have titled this album \\"wonderbread\\". People who dig this keep talking up all the \\"emotion\\" that is in JM's playing on this album, well it didnt sound much like that to my ears. Sounded more like some young kid trying to sound like hes an old man, something that comes off as fake every time. These blues is killin me.
B0000C0FJB|5.0|Rush in Rio is a fantastic once in a lifetime experience which exploits the talents of these three Canadian icons!. Rush absolutely sounds fabulous in every song performed in Brazil. The setlist is an absolute 3-hour blast, the audience is pure energetic fun and the band at their finest form. <br /> <br />
0895260131|5.0|This book so apropos to our times, and what is truly scary is that many people are completely blind to disasters which are already on their door-step. [...]    I will never forget the day (3 years ago) when on television I saw footage of an Islamic \\"activist\\" (BBC terminology) killing three little children, and then after the UK soldiers had the killer pinned down, a UK civil liberitarian came sprinting up to them and and started screaming in the soldiers face about how this killer had \\"his rights\\". Typically, this civil liberitarian didn't even make one mention of the three dead children. This is the type of misguided idiocy which Robert Spencer is trying to battle, but Robert is facing an uphill battle due to the extensive ignorance of the masses. Undoubtedly these ignoramuses are the spiritual children of those nitwits who were blind to the threat posed by the Nazis, but rather offered excuses about the Nazis essential \\"peaceable intentions\\"...    [...]    Luke 12:54-56 \\"And he said also to the people, When ye see a cloud rise out of the west, straightway ye say, There cometh a shower; and so it is. And when ye see the south wind blow, ye say, There will be heat; and it cometh to pass. Ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky and of the earth; but how is it that ye do not discern this time?\\"     Good on ya Robert, this book is a classic, destined to upset dreamers, and to educate intelligent people willing to swallow and digest facts in spite of their unpleasant taste.
B000B8IA2G|3.0|Make no mistake, the Stargate premise is great and having watched this entire series in a matter of days I would have to say that for me it never rose to anything like it's full potential. <br /> <br />Some of the plots are quite thin, some very soapy and others excellent. Some of the camera shots and footage is used repeatedly and there is a lot of repetition throughout the series. The characters, after 22 hours of viewing remain shallow. <br /> <br />Ultimately, the main point of conflict only develops in the last 2 episodes and even at that, we're left at series end with a ridiculously cheap cliffhanger. This defines the series - rack 'n' stack, hope for the best. This excellent concept is now incidential to the needs of the producers. <br /> <br />This box set won't be added in my library!
B000BVD460|5.0|Well let me just quickly get to my point Eminem made 5 albums.I for one like all of them BUT this album might be his last because I heard he might be retiring...sad yes but true.                                                                                                                                                                                            But then you look at this album it has all of his hits except for forgot about dre but in this case he literally forgot to add dre in this album ..well at least that song anyway. However the good part about this album is that he added some new songs such as \\"When im gone\\"  <br /> <br /> <br />Overall this album deserves 5 stars (D A M N ) i cant rate more.. I still think this is a better way of ending his career because 5 albums is good enough for me better ending a career with one last album then getting shot...tupac...*sobs*
0790729725|5.0|\\"Goodfellas\\" was recently named in a British magazine as \\"The Greatest Film Of All Time\\". While that is up for debate, there is no doubt that it's up there. Brutal, shocking and true, \\"Goodfellas\\" is cinema at best.<br /><br />Martin Scorcese directs and Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci lead the pack of an amazing bunch talented actors in this tale of notorious gangster turned rat Henry Hill (played with a quiet ferocity by Liotta). As a kid, Hill become caught up in the world of the mob. Working for reputed mob Paulie Cicero (Paul Sorvino), he does some small jobs before moving into the big league. He meets veteran criminal Jimmy \\"The Gent\\" Conway (Robert De Niro) and the wacko Tommy De Vito (Joe Pesci, who was brilliant). The three hook up for a series of violent crimes over the years. Henry also goes through a tumultous marriage to Karen (Lorraine Bracco). As the years go on, the stakes get higher, these Goodfellas come closer to getting caught every day. Eventually, justice reigns, and the price is paid. And if the ending is disappointing, don't forget that all of this happened.<br /><br />This film is truly a masterpiece. It's by far Scorcese's best film, and the actors have rarely been better. Pesci deserved his Oscar, because he stole the show from everyone. This is a film that everyone should see at least once.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This movie was incredible and one of the best movies in recent years. Yes, it wasn't Star Wars or any other recent sci-fi films that have so much CGI or overwhelming graphics but a old fashion space western that reminded me of how Star Wars used to be - a good movie with a good plot.  <br /> <br />Unfortunatly, due to the lack of theaters and the fact that many people had to drive more then an hour to see it at the closest theater - it could not do as well as it could have had Universal pushed for more theaters. Another reminder of the first release of Star Wars in '77. <br /> <br />Maybe its not for everyone but everyone I know except one person loves the movie and has seen it multiple times. The one person who saw it I think was expecting another Revenge of the Sith...   <br /> <br />This movie brings back the magic that was once there. Those that truly appreciate it do so for the fact that it is fun to watch, moving to listen to and gets the heart rate going no matter how many times you see it. You have your classic characters from mythology - the hero (River & Mal), the Warrior Princess (Zoe), the goofball (Wash), the anti-hero (The Operative), the Swashbuckler (Jayne) and so on. This is classic mythos in modern form once again. Maybe its predictable in some points but maybe thats because its a story we have been hearing all our lives in every great story ever heard, listened to or seen.

6302508878|5.0|Growing up in the 1950's and watching Million Dollar Theater, this was always one my favorite movies.  Even now when it plays on TV/cable I will watch bits and pieces.  Ann, Carl, Jack, the skipper, it doesn't get better than this.  The scenes on Skull Island, trying to negotiate with the natives that is great.  Carl telling the skipper find out what goes on here.  Jack telling Carl, you got her into this now you get her out.  Making Ann the bride of Kong.  Remember this movie is made in 1933. There are 3 different Kong sizes throughout the movie, notice his size breaking through the gate, then captured and then fighting the other animals.  They used 3 different size Kongs. I will go and see the new version but the black and white one is great.  If you never seen it you will enjoy it.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|Whoever wrote the below review complaining about the full screen presentation is not paying attention. The film was never shot or concieved for any widescreen format. Since all of the archival footage is in the 1.33 aspect ratio(or Full screen), all of the interviews were shot the same way. In addition, since this was made for PBS and conceived for TV, there was no reason to use any widescreen aspect ratio.
B000BVD460|1.0|Thankfully I shouldn't have to hear his annoying voice for 3-5 years, he is white suburbia's poster child and he makes me sick.  Listen to some inspired Caucasian rappers such as Cage, and Slug of Atmosphere.  <br /> <br />
B00003CXCT|1.0|I don't recommend this box simply because it's NOT the ORIGINAL films! It's a new version (2004) with new digital special effects.
0689865384|5.0|I bought this book, and the sequel, on a whim. I was in the middle of another book, so I read that one first. And then I picked up Uglies kind of casual and began to read. I did not put it down, could not put it down. <br /> <br />The story enthralls you from the very begining as we meet Tally as she is on a mission to contact her old friend. We follow her throughout the book as she befriends Shay, learns to hoverboard, makes trips to the mysterious Rusty Ruins, and crosses paths with the haunting Specials. I love the way the book is written, and the character development as we watch Tally realise that there is more to life than just \\"being pretty\\" <br /> <br />This book moves quickly and falling in love with Tally, Shay, David, and the rest of the characters is far too easy. You feel their heartache, there exhileration, the hurt, the betrayal. This is one of my favorite books of all time.
B000AP04FG|5.0|I've never been afraid to admit I was never that big of a fan of Brad Pitt. Other than \\"True Romance\\", I've never been taken by any of his films. And also, I've never been particulary taken by the lovely Angelina Jolie. So when my dad brought home \\"Mr. & Mrs. Smith\\", I thought, \\"oh great, the last movie I want to see\\". But, I decided to watch it say.<br /><br />Needless to say, I was blown away.<br /><br />This is truly a great film. It won't be an Oscar contender, but who cares. Most reviewers have already gone into plot details, so I'll just say this. This film is really fun. Great action, a lot of laughs. The plot is actually well written for what is meant to be a mindless action film.<br /><br />The two stars were great. I find myself able to tolerate them more now that I've seen the movie. Also, it was great to see good ol' Vince Vaughn pop up as Eddie, John Smith's (Brad's character) best friend.<br /><br />Bottom line: highly recommended. See it as soon as possible.
B0000029AP|4.0|THIS IS PROBABLY THE BEST AEROSMITH RELEASE EVER IN MY OPINION WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ROCKS AND PUMP.TOYS IN THE ATTIC IS ONE OF THEIR BETTER SONGS BUT FOR SOME REASON YOU NEVER SEEM TO SEE IT ON ANY OF THE COMPILATIONS THEY RELEASE.SWEET EMOTION AND WALK THIS WAY ARE STILL LIVE FAVORITES TO THIS DAY.A VERY GOOD ONE!
B000BVD460|5.0|I had to do this review now, it's sickening to see the hate this man receives.  It's seems to me sometimes that people care more about Eminem's life than their own.  Some of ya'll need to grow up and live with the fact that he will be considered one of greats of hip hop.  Now on to the real review... <br /> <br />Now this is obviously a great CD of Eminem's greatest hits, but there are a few weak points on it.  The reason I gave this 5 stars is because you'd expect all greatest hits CDs to get 5 stars, except for all the wack artists maybe.  I also don't consider greatest hits CDs as classics either.  He added 3 new unreleased tracks on it to spice it up a little too.  However 1 song definitely made things and worse.  His track called 'Fack' is a stupid and pointless song to be put on a greatest hits album.  It's very childish and immature and in my opinion is not a good song at all.  The other trak called 'Shake That' featuring Nate Dogg does a better job.  It's sort of a club track, Eminem is not known for these type tracks so that's why I was kind of disappointed that he made a track like this.  It's ok and all and Nate Dogg helps it out a lot but to me this just isn't the Eminem I know.  The third track called 'When I'm Gone' was amazing though.  The message behind the song was unreal.  It's full of emotion and reality about what's happening in his home life with his daughter and ex-wife(however, they are now back together with plans of remarrying).  There's a lot of rumors going around about his retirement and he denies it saying he's just going to take a break from the spotlight.  The other tracks on the album are all Eminem classic hits except for 'Just Lose It.'  Eminem also added the live version of the track 'Stan' he did with Elton John at the 2003 Grammys.  I would highly suggest this album to any fan of Eminem, it's definitely worth your money and you won't be disappointed.  Haters, quit hatin...
B000000OQF|5.0|ONE OF THE BEST HARD ROCK RELEASES OF ALL TIME.THIS IS THE BEST BAND OF THE LATE EIGHTIES AND EARLY NINETIES.THIS HAS EVERYTHING A HARD ROCK FAN COULD WANT AND STILL SOUNDS AS GOOD TODAY AS IT DID EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO.......
B000002GOZ|5.0|I enjoy high end home audio, so while auditioning a set of $20k+ speakers the owner of the store popped in this CD.  I'm super familiar with Adams and have heard him on great systems in the past, BUT this particular CD has some exceptional tracks in terms of separation, imaging and soundstage that are extremely uncommon on live recordings.      Even though I'm not a big fan of Brian Adams this cd has some \\"high end\\" qualities that I couldn't pass up, I had to buy it!  One of the best recordings of \\"Heaven\\" that I've heard.
B000002U82|5.0|THIS IN MY OPINION IS PINK FLOYD'S BEST RELEASE.EASILY RANKS IN THE TOP TEN OF ALL TIME........
B0002YLC24|5.0|If I can stop sobbing long enough to form coherent thoughts.... <br /> <br />This movie is the most perfect romantic film I have ever seen -- absolutley no exaggeration <br /> <br />I figured, having vaguely remembered the Before Sunrise, that the ending would be ambiguous and leave you totally hungry for more. So going into Before Sunset, I was determined not to get sucked in.  But it me like a ton of bricks in such a beautiful subtle way, that I fell and fell hard before I could stop myself. <br /> <br />Absolute perfection.
B000002H2H|5.0|THIS IS PROBABLY MY FAVORITE OF ALL IN THE METALLICA CATALOG.FADE TO BLACK IS ONE OF THEIR BEST SONGS.CREEPING DEATH IS ALSO VERY GOOD.THEY SHOWED TREMENDOUS GROWTH BETWEEN KILL EM ALL AND THIS RELEASE.....
B000005RST|5.0|True classic from a modern composer. With this album, Enigma made another step towards musical perfection. It is yet unclear to me, how Mr. Gdula can even compare such masterpiece to the works of an American popstar, Prince. After all, who knows Prince besides those who spent millions in his promotion and their [happy] victims? Who's gonna know Prince (besides some hardcore musical historians) a decade from now? With all due respect to his work as performer, in terms of musicality Enigma simply beats the latter by all parameters. Produced quite awhile ago, it still sounds fresh and well up to date. Originality, intelligence, sensuality are what distinguishes MCMXC A.D. pieces from all the rest of wanna-be replicas of genuine art. ...and again, intelligence! [The word that almost lost its meaning in today's art mass-production] Two big thumbs up, Mr. (and Mrs.) Gretu, with this one!
B00097DX3U|2.0|I DON'T THINK THAT THIS IS AS GOOD AS A SOUNDGARDEN OR RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE RELEASE.TRY AGAIN GUYS........
B000B8I8X2|3.0|As mentioned by some other reviews, this disk has its ups and downs. I am a huge fan of Roadrunner Records so when this CD came out i just had to have it. It was what i expected, and not what i expected at the same time. First the bad. The worst songs on this album are definately Constitution Down, which is an ok song, It just has a sucky chorus (constitution down, allocate the unsound) or whatever that means...yeah...whatever that is supposted to mean, i really dont care, it sucks. It's unfortunate because the riffage is intense, solos amazing, and druming insane. Next is \\"In The Fire.\\" This is a huge disappointment because the song itself is amazing. Awesome breakdowns, insane riffs. But the vocals just don't seem to grow on me. King Diamond sounds a lot like Dani Filth IMO, and I just can't get used to the \\"being choked to death\\" lyrics. Again, i emphasize, with a different lyrical approach, this may be one of the top 5 best songs on the CD.\\"Roads.\\" Hmmm. Mabye this was supposted to be a clever idea for a break in heaviness. They achieve this, but it just plain sucks. This seems to me to be a filler song and is TOO slow and is very random. \\"I Don't Wanna Be(A Superhero)\\" has some sort of pop-punk-rockish combination that is not only repetitive, but dull and boring. There's some pretty good riffage, but thats about it. Now for the better songs. First up, and also the intro track on the cd \\"The Dagger.\\" Love Howard Jones, but the bass/drums chorus isn't to my liking. It seems very out of place in the song. Other than that it's a great tune. That man has got to have one of the best voices I've ever heard. \\"The End\\" is also one of the best on there. At only 19 years old, Matthew Heafy has sure made a name for himself. This is probally the track most people will pick up the CD for, and with good reason. \\"The Enemy\\" is another high-point of this CD. Big Chimaira fans will love this song, as Mark Hunter does a great job fronting this one. If you are a fan of heavy musicor of Roadrunner Records, definately pick this one up. If you find it at a reduced price definately pick it up. If its $18, like it is here on Amazon, dont bother.
B000002UAU|5.0|RELEASED IN 1967 IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST CONCEPT ALBUMS...THE ROCK WORLD WAS CHANGED FOREVER WITH THIS RELEASE.
B00062J00S|5.0|Ok, come on. Don't tell me you've never seen this movie. You don't deserve to celebrate Christmas if you haven't watched this movie at least once in your life. I'll admit, that it took me a while to warm up to this movie. It is sort of long, and of course old. Black and white. But one day when I was about fourteen, I decided that I wanted to know what all the hype was about this thing. Well I discovered that this is really, REALLY a great movie. I try to get it in once every Holiday season. Jimmy Stewart is a very colorful character, who gets the short end of the deal his whole life, but never lets him down. Eventually a few things go his way, he marries a smokin wife (Donna Reed) and has a million babies with her. He runs the local Savings and Loan office and helps virtually everyone in town. But then one Christmas things get really screwed up, and it appears that he's going to lose everything and wind up in jail. Oh, it gets intense.. but then the plot twists a little, and he is visited by an angel named Clarence. Clarence is sort of a surly screwball himself, but he teaches Jimmy Stewart a very important lesson. I won't give nothing away, but understand, that I always manage to squeeze out a few tears at the end of this one. If you have any kind of soul, you will dig this movie. At least once.
B00006AG5N|5.0|THIS IS A VERY GOOD RELEASE WITH ALL OF ELVIS PRESLEYS NUMBER ONE HITS.A GREAT PLACE TO START IF YOUR JUST GETTING INTO HIS RECORDED WORK........
B000002JEV|5.0|This double live album cannot dissapoint. It is without a doubt AMAZING material. This shows that LED ZEPPELIN was, in the early days, possessed. They were just so crazy. I have just about everything Zeppelin. I have never really been impressed with other live recordings. Though they are not bad, I would certainly rather listen to a studio recording over say THE SONG REMAINS THE SAME. But with BBC sessions, you get the band fresh, on their toes and ready to astonish. They are far from being tired on these recordings and they simply want to kick some ass. Which is what they do. Aside from that, there is more than just live versions of the songs you know. A couple of rare songs show up here as well. The tune THE GIRL I LOVE HAS LONG BLACK WAVY HAIR is a totally rockin' blues track. I can't believe they kept that one a secret as long as they did. Plenty of insane face melter solos from Jimmy Page, and Robert Plant when his voice wasn't ragged, but crisp.. and right on the money. Bonzo wails the f**K out of those drums.. and JP JONES does... whatever it is he does, its frikin rad. All goods on this thing. Yeah, five stars indeed.
B00008OLIO|5.0|THIS IN MY OPINION IS PROBABLY THE BEST OF ALL THE CRUE RELEASES IN THEIR CATALOG.FROM LIVE WIRE TO ON WITH THE SHOW THERE IS NOT ONE BAD SONG ON THE WHOLE THING.THIS ONE DOESN'T GET AS MUCH ATTENTION AS THEIR LATER DISCS BUT THATS TOO BAD BECAUSE THIS ONE IS QUITE GOOD!
B000BVEKO0|5.0|I have been listening to Korn now for about 6 years. I have all of their albums and I have heard every song that Korn has nothing to do with, and I can honestly say that this is the best CD that they have come out with. It contains music appealing to all types of people. I would recommend this CD to anyone who loves anything to do with rock music. My favorite songs on this CD are 'Love Song', 'Coming Undone', and 'Open Up'. The drums are great on all of the tracks and the vocals are superb, and now that Korn is only a four piece band, and have lost one of their guitar players, the one they have left has really stepped up his guitar playing and it makes for a really enjoyable album.
B000001ELR|5.0|IN MY OPINION THIS IS ONE OF THE HEAVIEST ALBUMS OF ALL TIME.THE DRUMS ARE BOMBASTIC THROUGHOUT.ERIC CARR HAD HIS FINEST DRUMMING ON THIS RELEASE....ONE OF THE BEST METAL ALBUMS OF THE EIGHTIES!
B000B8QEZG|1.0|Okay, I've been a fan since day 1...I remember buying the Madonna album on LP when I was 5.  I've also amassed quite a collection over the years (much of which was sold after the hideous American Life which I don't include in the Madonna catalog.)  Madonna is on this electronica kick and it's GARBAGE.  What happened to those pop songs of old?  It's that Mirwais idiot who for some reason has Madonna mesmerized into thinking that this is quality music.  Why in the hell doesn't she drop that Frenchie and go back to William Orbit.  I hate French people, but that's an aside. This album doesn't flow and the lyrics on most of the songs could have been written by a child.  I'd expect this from the talentless Lindsay Lohan, but Madonna?  Come on!  I thought she was in a different league, as she used to be.  Why couldn't we have a \\"normal\\" album with regular songs without background computer vocals and way over-processing and not to mention the irksome repetition of certain words or phrases.  I don't hate electronica if it's got soul, but this album is just flat noise.  The constant repetition makes me ill.  So this album sucks in my opinion.  Ray of Light was astonishing and I really think Madonna should feel really ashamed at this crap she released on this CD.  And why is it that Madonna keeps having to tell us that she lived a selfish life, but now she's seen the light?  We get it!  I hoped for better after the disastrous American Life, but I guess the days of regular pop songs and hits like \\"Like a Prayer\\" \\"Live To Tell\\" and \\"You'll See\\" are gone.  I understand Madonna wanted to make a dance album (eventhough her ballads are incredible) but why this type of dance album?  Remember her dance songs not so intertwined with electronica crap?  So Madonna has finally fallen.  She should retire.  If she never releases another album, an actual good album, she will have ended such a long career that was all for not.  I know people hate comparisons between Madonna and Tori Amos, butTori's latest release is amazing!  Buy the beekeeper instead of Confessions, Amarantine by Enya, the new Mariah CD, etc..There are so many better albums out there!  Even the Pussycat Dolls' CD is better than this, and that's sad.  I have a confession, and it's that this album sucks royally, and I can't emphasize it enough.
B000063DIR|5.0|THE BEST RELEASE IN OZZY'S TWENTY FIVE YEAR SOLO CAREER.IT ROCKS FROM START TO FINISH.HOWEVER I WOULD STEER CLEAR OF THE NEW VERSION OF THIS RELEASE WHICH IS RE-RECORDED WITH NEW MUSICIANS DUE TO A FALLING OUT OVER ROYALTIES BETWEEN OZZY AND THE ORIGINAL MUSICIANS.......
0895260131|5.0|Someone gave me this book.  For those who think it is hateful, look at the differences today between the west and islamic societies.  In most countries that are islamic, Jews are not even allowed to enter the country.  The few other religionists that exist there suffer severe legal disabilities, not to mention actual attacks.  There is no equality under the law in Islam.  Christians in these countries, the few that there are, cannot build churches or spread the relgion.  However, muslims in the west build mosques and attempt to convert others.  In muslim countris it is literally against the law to make a joke about the religion or question it in any way. Here, on the other hand, you can't turn on the TV without hearing a criticism of Christianity or Judaism.  There is no amount of liberal rhetoric that can change facts.

B000002UJQ|5.0|I'd been hearing about this group and especially this album for years before I actually heard it.  When I finally heard Airbag my reaction was \\"Wow, it sounds like King Crimson.\\"  Fast forward a few years.  While sounding like King Crimson might be exclusive to Radiohead it's also exclusive to that one track; Radiohead is completely different but they are similar; they are both successful AND artistic, really pushing the envelope while moving the crowd.  They both have that chameleon quality, reinventing themselves album by album.  It's nice to know there's bands out there this good. <br /> <br />My recommendation: buy immediately!

0807126063|5.0|A friend loaned me a copy of this book over twenty years ago, telling me that this was a novel I simply must not miss reading. Not quite believing his enthusiastic praise, I opened the book and was introduced to the gargantuan, flatulent, self-important, arrogantly pseudo-intellectual person of Ignatius J. Reilly. By the end of the first paragraph, I was intrigued. By the end of the first scene, in which he nearly causes a riot in front of D.H Holmes, I was hopelessly hooked. In the decades that have passed since that first reading, \\"Confederacy\\" has steadily ascended my list of all-time favorite books, becoming more deliciously funny with each reading.    Ignatius is an unforgettable character. Ensconced in his ramshackle room, strewn with Big Chief tablets filled with invective toward the twentieth century and his longing for the good old days of the Dark Ages, he brews his indictment of modernity and of anything and everything he considers lacking in \\"theology and geometry\\". Unfortunately for him, his mother's drunken driving brings the threat of legal action when she demolishes part of a building and he is faced with the appalling need to Go To Work. Needless to say, the working world isn't quite prepared for this Don Quixote in a hunting cap.     Along the way, there are a number of equally priceless supporting characters, each a gem in its own right. The hopelessly inept Patrolman Mancuso sniffles his way about the seedier parts of New Orleans, in his outrageous \\"undercover\\" costume of the day, sadly hoping to arrest some \\"suspicious character\\". Miss Lana Lee, of the quite inappropriately named Night of Joy bar, provides, um,  charity work for the orphans, discreetly wrapped in plain brown paper and collected by a local hoodlum. Then there's Jones, who plots his revenge against Lana's tyranny as an employer from within a cloud of blue cigarette smoke. All of these and others are superbly woven together in this grand comic tale, their stories and fates drawn together by Fortuna's wheel, as Ignatius might say.    As others have remarked, Toole's suicide pre-empted what likely would have been a wonderful literary career. An unpublished author at his death, Toole's only other work is a short novel called \\"The Neon Bible\\", written while he was in his teens. That book is sufficiently inferior to \\"Confederacy\\" that I have never bothered to buy my own copy. However, I am now on my fourth copy of this novel, and expect it to continue to be a book I revisit time and again.    Most highly recommended.
B000003TAW|5.0|I will start off this review by saying that Weezer's blue album is one of the most solid efforts I have ever heard in long while. Every song is simply A+ quality material. Every song from \\"My Name is Jonas\\" to \\"Buddy Holly\\" to \\"Holiday\\" and back are just great songs, simply said.<br /><br />There is not a bad track on this album. A very rare thing in this day and age. If you're looking for a good, solid rock CD, go and pick up Weezer's blue album. It will not disappoint.
0061015725|3.0|Here we have another one of Michael Crichton's outings into the world of technology gone awry. It probably isn't too much of a stretch to say that if you have read one of Crichton's last several novels, you have essentially read them all. As with many of his books, we have here an essentially neutral technology creating havoc when over-reaching corporate and military types fiddle with it, a protagonist trying to warn of the dangers who is of course ignored until the situation is entirely out of hand, the requisite harrowing escapes, etc.  <br />That being said, this book is also like most of his others in that it is a fun, light read, and worth the few bucks and few hours one will invest in it.
B000AP04FG|5.0|Never has an actor and actress have more chemistry and Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.  Their chemistry and an entertaining script give readers more than just eye candy.  I haven't enjoyed a Brad Pitt movie in years-might be as far back as 'Seven'.  Going in to see this film, I wasn't expecting funny.  This movie is indeed that.<br />The movie starts off with two assasins attending marriage couseling.  (That in itself is a hoot) and quickly escalates to bond action freezy when the husband and wife are ordered to off each other.  Any more than that will totally be giving the story away--but this movie is a definite must-see.
B000002A46|5.0|I absolutly love this album.  I listen to it every Christmas until my kids are sick of it.  Her voice is amazing and I love the upbeat feel of the album.
B00005JOGU|5.0|I strongly believe that this film will certainly garner an Oscar nomination for Philip Seymour Hoffman. His portrayal of Truman Capote is mesmerizing, and it's even more challenging and convincing than his other works including Magnolia, Owning Mahoney, and Love Liza. I really didn't expect this film to move me, but that one scene when Capote(Hoffman) broke down into massive tears was so touching that I was crying along with him. This film is not a conventional biopic, since it only captures one major part of Capote's life, primarily focusing on his quest to uncover the truth behind the senseless murder of a Kansas farm family in 1959 in order to write his most acclaimed book entitled In Cold Blood. It covers the period when Capote was first inspired to write about the story upon reading the newspaper article, to spending more than four years of research and finally publishing the book in 1966.<br /><br />Truman Capote is an eccentric, humorous, and flamboyant openly gay writer. Hoffman certainly mastered the feminine mannerism, the babyish voice, and all the tormented heart and soul the Capote to perfection. Capote at one point told Perry Smith(Clifton Collins Jr.), one of the convicted murderer, that they are like twin brothers, and that one went out at the back door and the other went out the front door. They are in some ways, two of a kind, because they share very similar childhood abused and abandoned experiences. They just happened to have made very different choices in life. Smith chose to rob the farm family thinking that there was $10000 in the house, but he and his partner in crime ended up killing four members of that poor family for $45. Of course, that was the most important part of Capote's research, that took a lot of relentless pursuit.<br /><br />Catherine Keener plays Capote's best friend Nelle Harper Lee, who would eventually become an internationally with the release her novel To Kill A Mockingbird. Her performance is subdued, but her role is limited in screentime and not that challenging. Chris Cooper who played Alvin Dewey, the lawyer who refused to help Capote. The role is also somewhat low-key for the Oscar-winning(Adaptation) actor. Bruce Greenwood is delightful as Capote's affectionate lover, though they didn't have any love scenes to work with. The most striking supporting performance came from Clifton Collins Jr. who had some heavy duty scenes opposite Hoffman. He might be heading to the Best Supporting Actor cateogory come next month.<br /><br />Even though I found Capote to be kind of slow-paced, especially the first half an hour, it gradually becomes more gripping and emotionally affecting.s limited in screentime and not that challenging.

B00004T9UF|5.0|Ok Its December 2005 and IM STILL BUMPIN THIS CD! Ive owned it since 2000 but I thought I should mention instead of buying Curtain Call its a good album and all, all his pop hits what not This cd is his best work by far better than ENCORE better than Infinite, SlimShady LP, Its just good all the songs are fire! I mean Id bump this over Kayne West any day of the week Kayne is just played out, so isnt 50 man that guy just wore himself out. But If you must pick up a CD for the holidays look back at the THROW BACK THE MARSHALL MATHERS LP good CD and trust me will like it alot better than his so called GREATEST HITS ALBUM.
B0000028M7|5.0|This is one of my top 5 favorite CD's.  The opening cut \\"Dem Bones\\" sets the tone that I believe them bones are me.  It's hard  to describe other than to say that it is one  of those CDs that  as it stays in the CD player, you look forward to the next song coming around, and it never gets old, you can listen to it over and over.  Would? has one of the most killer bass lines in all of rock and roll.  Lead singer Layne Staley's vocals are strongest on this CD.  There is not a bad cut on  this, and I consider this to be a CLASSIC.  Must have, no 'bout a doubt it.<br />And let's not give mind to what kind of category the categorizors put this into.  It is damn good rock and roll no matter what you think you like the most.  Don't give it another thought, just buy it.

B00005R2M3|3.0|I never knew who Shakira was until she released Whenever, Wherever yet I didn't mind. She had a strong voice but I found the song to be bland and not very original. But with the more singles she released I started liking some of them and figured the CD might be okay. Not until about a month ago did I finally find it for the price I was willing to pay ($5.99), I was still reluctant to get it though. When I listened to it for the first time I wasn't impressed, and I'm still not. I do think she has the strongest, most distinctive voice pop music has seen in years, but that's all a lot of the songs on here have going for them. My opinion might be derived from the fact that I don't much care for it when an artist makes a CD part English and part Spanish. Yet still, this is a good attempt at freshening up a genre that needed it desperately.<br /><br />Objection (Tango) is a good song, the music is kind of corny but it works for this type of song. The lyrics are pretty spiteful and well presented vocally so it is worth a listen. Underneath Your Clothes, however sexual the title is, is a very good ballad. Shakira can do upbeat dance-esque tracks well, but I think the slower songs are where she truly shines. Underneath Your Clothes shows Shakira at her strongest, vocally and lyrically, so this is in every right a highlight. Rules is a nice rebound track after Whenever, Wherever. Rules might also be the poppiest song on here, where only the chorus really makes an impact. The One is reason enough to buy this CD, and is the song that eventually suckered me into getting it. Yes, The One is a sappy love song, but it has a decidedly rock edge to it and Shakira's voice sounds heartbroken enough to pull off the lyrics, yet strong enough to carry the song above and beyond. The One is without a doubt my favorite song on Laundry Service. Ready For The Good Times is a shout out back to the early to mid 90s pop music. Much like Ashlee Simpson's new CD beckons to the 80s fairly successfully, Shakira's attempt at reaching out to a different musical time is a much welcomed treat. Fool rounds out the decent to good songs this CD has to offer, topheavy indeed. Fool is a catchy, good song with a chorus that will be stuck in your head for days. It seems like either Shakira or Epic wanted to put the English songs first and then the Spanish songs afterwards, which was a bad idea. Poem To A Horse is unfairly lumped in the bad section of this CD however. It is a good song and, having this CD been divided up like it is, should've been at the beginning. These are all my opinions though, they shouldn't be taken too seriously, just trust me when I say if you're like me and only listen to pop music on occassion that this CD might not be for you.<br /><br />My favorite songs on here are Objection (Tango), Underneath Your Clothes, The One, Fool, and Poem To A Horse. I won't deny that Laundry Service isn't a good CD full of catchy songs and lush vocals, but I've never been a fan of foreign languages in my music. I do realize that Shakira is merely embracing her roots though, so I do admire that. Basically, if you can't handle Spanish songs mixed with English songs, this isn't a CD you'll want.ully, Shakira's attempt at reaching out to a different musical time is a much welcomed treat.

B000BMSTMS|5.0|I've loved Korn ever since I first heard the excellent single \\"Here to stay\\" from the groundbreaking album Untouchables (2002), and I immediately felt like this was IT, this was the band for me, and after months of patiently waiting, I bought the album the day it hit the stores. So, three albums later, do I still feel as excited as the first time I heard them?  <br /> <br />Korn is a band in a neverending transformation, and this time they've taken help from the Matrix and Atticus Ross, formerly known as producers to such artists as Britney Spears and Avril Lavigne. Do they manage to make such a courageous move, without sounding like Kelly Clarkson? With all respect, a resounding YES! \\"See you on the other side\\" is a breathtaking experience, making you facing your inner, and in Jonathan Davis' world, dark feelings. Every song is unique, weird and absolutely stunning. So do as I, and jump around in your house, whilst screaming \\"stand up! nobody's dryin to save you <br />speak up! nobody's waiting to see you <br />wake up! nobody's trying to play you\\"   <br /> <br />And to answer my first question: I still love Korn, and this is a dignified continuation of their impressing career, so invite yourself to a wild trip through your whole spectrum of feelings!
B0007GAERG|5.0|Mariah has satisfied me again with her 2005 hit album \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" The album was heralded as \\"The return of the voice\\" and its absoloutly true! Here is my track by track guide    It's Like That-A fast, up-tempo club song, good vocals on Mariah's part, and the end with fatman scoop is definetly the highlight of the song! The beat is perfect for dancing, definetly one of her best up-tempos! this was the 1st single from the album. Grade:A+    We belong Together-EVERYONE has heard this one! Beginning with a piano intro, We belong together is one of THE most succsessful singles of the year! The beat is very mid-tempo R&B, and its relaxing. Mariah's voice is suberb, especially her belting at the end! The song is about breaking up with your lover, and wanting them back. This was the 2nd single. Grade:A+    Shake it off-A mid-tempo R&B song, \\"Shake it off\\" is another breakup song, the song has a beat very similar to ushers \\"confessions part II\\" she even sings in a vein similar to usher! Vocal wise, the song is whispery until the end, but she belts it out in the end. I like the bridge, \\"I gotta shake shake shake it off\\" This was the third single. GRADE A+    Mine Again- A slow, R&B ballad. It begins with a slow 70's style keyboard, with mariah coming in soon after. During the chorus, she BELTS it out. And the song as a whole has a very 70's feel. I love the flutes in the background, so catchy. The song does lack a good ending though, it kinda just ends all too suddenly.  Grade:B    Say somethin'-A fast, neptunes produced club song. Mariah sounds almost drunk during the berses, and the lyrics are crazy, (references to stars and planets, etc) but the chorus is simply infectious, and the snoop dogg rap fits in with the song perfectly. DEFINTETLY single material. Grade:A    Stay The night- This kanye west produced anthem samples an old song named \\"betcha by golly wow\\" And it has a very old school, Jackson five-ish feel. Mariah wonders whether to sleep withsomeone she had recently broken up with after he asks her to. The song has a LOT of belting and i like the end where she belts out \\"STAAAY\\" and background vocals start. Pure perfection! Grade:A    Get your number- A Jermaine Dupri production, the song samples \\"Just my imagination\\" by a group called illusion. The song has a differen't song structure, Jermaine dupri sings the chorus, and Mariah does the the verses, the beat almost makes one think of Mariah's earlier song \\"Fantasy\\" The highlight of the song happens to be Mimi's two 10 second raps, in which she tells of her \\"pimp penthouse\\" and her \\"House in capri\\" This was the 4th single in europe. Grade: A+    One and only- A very downbeat, slick, R&B song, \\"One and only\\" features a rap by world famous rapper Twista, and is about a cheating man, and how mimi hopes to find her \\"one and only\\" Mariah actually sings VERY fast, like twista, the chorus is a little boring however, could have been better! Grade:B-    Circles- A slow old school mariah song, its about how she is going around in circles over her man. the production is slow, but good. I love the mariah high note at the end! pure fabulousness! The whole song is a excellent, and the ending is great, good climax! Grade:A    Your Girl-The song begins with a spanish guitar, and it has a very up-beat feel. Its short, and she really belts out the chorus!  It is about wanting to be with someone. What else can i say, a true album highlight!    I wish you knew-This song has a fake \\"live\\" audience in it, but it fits in the song. The chorus is nice and easy to sing, and I love the spoken word part in the middle, very nice. The osng has a lot of nice background vocals in he beginning and end. Its one of the slower songs, and its a happy song. Grade:A    To the floor- The fastest song on the second half of the record, this is a duet with nelly, and it was produced by the neptunes. The beat is very fast, and the bass is loud, perfect for the clubs. The vocals by both are whispery, and hard to hear, but it doesnt degrade the song. Grade: A    Joy ride- Perfect for lounging around, Joy ride's beat is slow, and puts one in a hypnotic state. The vocals are nice and loud, and the verses are sung in an almost nursery rhyme like way. The chorus has more background singers than mariah's voice, but its still a treat. Grade: B+    Fly like a bird- A gospel song, it is very jazzy, and her pastor makes a cameo! At first, mariah's voice is flat, but as the song goes on, it gets louder and stronger, until the climax, with Mariah belting out the chorus many times, along with a choir chanting begind her. Its probably my favorite song on the record, it is inspiring, fun, and a perfect song in every sense of the word. Grade: A+    Overview-I was one of many who bought this album the day it came out (april 12) and the album has grown on me more and more ever since! Most of the osngs are fast and bouncy, and even the ballads are fabulous! There is not one bad song on the album, and i cannot wait to see what Mariah will do next.    PS: Try buying The emancipation of mimi Ultra platinum edition! It has 3 new songs, a dvd, a documentry, and a remix of \\"We belong together\\" One of the new songs is the hit \\"Don't forget about us\\" its a  perfect christmas gift for any Mariah fan in your family!
B000B5IPLK|2.0|One of the most important things before a live show is to make sure that you have your vocal chords nice and rested.  This entire cd is good but Alicia's voice is shot.  Hoarse vocals lead to bad recordings but luckily Alicia still had her other talents to save this cd from being a total failure.
B000BMSTMS|5.0|I'm one of those \\"loyal\\" Korn fans who have followed them undaunted throughout their creative trials and tribulations. Let's face it, the whole FOLLOW THE LEADER bit was on of the biggest marketing stunts any band has ever tried to pull. I'm pretty sure their producers forced them to do it, and they dragged LIMP BIZKIT and otherwise respectable numetal fans and artists down with them. But something about the band- I don't know what it was... their personality? their sense of humor about the whole thing? Either case, I continued to buy each album as it came out. And now that Korn is with a new record company, is it any wonder that they've come out with a BETTER ALBUM? With this album, Korn takes themselves much more seriously as musicians- the \\"real singin\\" on tear jerker- but they still retain their fun loving sense of humor and \\"just-don't-give-a-f*ck\\" attitude. It's nice to see John back with the bagpipes (shame on Fred Durst trying to discourage that) and it's also cool to hear them incorperating a piano into the mix. Weather or not there is in fact a God, Head's dilerverence was the best thing that ever happened to this band. That, and their switching record labels. Now they know what their doing, and I think no one is telling them what to do so much anymore. Otherwise, they'd have been forced to do LIFE IS PEACHY again. I must also applaud them for being ambitious enough to release a double album, even if the second disc is nothing more than remixes and a couple of videos. It would have been great to see a double album from this band at this stage in their career. Let's hope that there will me more from this band in the near future, and let's hope that they manage to stick to whatever their currrent inspiration is. The potential this band exhibits on this album is nothing short of stunning. Such a well crafted mix of melody and super heavy rythm has not been witnessed since the dawn of grunge. I think the problem is that when Korn first came out, no one took them seriously except for coke-sniffing teenagers who didn't know a d@mned thing about music anyway and only cared about them because their music was \\"new\\" and \\"offensive\\". Well now they're back, with a new sound, a new frame of mind, and yet they've still maintained the same attitude. Let's see what happens next.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Ohhhhhh my god. This album is the best green day album yet. Every song is great, but thats not why i love this album i love its story about Jesus of Surbrubia leaving his small hometown in search of something and St Jimmy a loud mouth drugie trying to overcome his inner demons but ends up killing himself and whatshername who is something she doesnt want to be anymore. Its awsome they could make a novel or even a movie about it You got to love it. It also gots some political stuff to in it like american idiot and holiday. Greatest album of our geniration.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|This is simple the best album of the year and the best of SOAD: <br /> <br />Attack: 10/10 <br />Dreaming: 11/10 <br />Kill Rock'n Roll: 11/10 <br />Hypnotize: 9.7/10 <br />Stealing Society: 9.7/10 <br />Tentative: 11/10 <br />U-FIG: 9.7/10 <br />Holy Mountains: 10/10 <br />Vicinity of Obscenity: 9.7/10 <br />She's Like Heroin: 9/10 <br />Lonely Day: 11/10 <br />Soldier Side: 11/10 <br /> <br />All songs of album are amazing, but my favourite tracks are Lonely Day, Soldier Side, Dreaming, Kill Rock'n Roll and Tentative .
B00004BZ0N|5.0|This album blew me away! I got it shortly after i got the American Idoit cd \\"which is also one of the best punk albums ever\\" and loved it. I always knew that Green Day was influenced by The Clash but i never gave them a chance but when i did it was no mistake! If your a Green Day fan you should check it out or if you simply like music then check out this album NOW!
B000BEZPQE|4.0|Its good to see these guys have released a collection of songs in live pure form, proving they are today's mainstream metal gods.  Corey Taylor's voice though sounds like crap in a few of the songs- probably because he's singing behind a mask. The guitars sound ripe and ready, and Joey's drumming is very intense indeed.  Nice job on including \\"Get This\\", \\"Skin Ticket\\", \\"purity\\", and of course the crowd favorite: \\"Eeyore\\".   <br />Choice cuts: <br />\\"The Blister Exists\\" <br />\\"Disasterpiece\\" <br />\\"Before I Forget\\" <br />\\"Vermillion\\" <br />\\"Purity\\" <br />\\"Three Nil\\" <br />\\"The Nameless\\" <br />\\"Skin Ticket\\" <br />\\"Duality\\" <br />\\"Wait and Bleed\\" <br /> <br />Great CD- great collection of Slipknot. <br />This tour was awesome as well <br />
B000092ZYX|5.0|In my opinion, Radiohead attained greatness in 1997 with the sublime, conceptual Ok Computer, went off, successfully, in an electronica direction with Kid A and Amnesiac, and with this recording, Hail to the Thief, manage to blend their strengths as both songsters and sonic sculptors. In lesser hands, such an attempt would have resulted in incoherence. But with a brilliant band such as this, it's unlikely that they can do wrong, at least at the present moment. Instead, they have delivered a lush, brooding work of musical art.
B0006399FS|5.0|Give it a few days, become familiar with the songs.  At first it may be kind of blah, then all of a sudden the songs sitck out and rock your world! Crumbs From Your Table is my fave. This CD ROCKS!
B00008YJHC|5.0|When judging which Pixies album is the best, you might as well toss a coin, because, after all, we are dealing with varying degrees of near-perfection.  Bossanova is magnificent album.   Don't listen to people who claim that this album is disappointment (and as for people who claim that The Breeders' Pod is a better album- Puh-lllease!!)   <br /> <br />Bossanova is gorgeous.  Cecelia Ann is a ripsnorting opener, Velouria is perfect grunge-pop.  Is She Weird is dark and kinky, with a great bassline.  Ana and Havalina are blissful slices of surf pop, and Dig For Fire and All Over the World tip a nod to Talking Heads.  Possibly the highlight is the Happening, with its wonderful spoken-word coda.  (Check out the Pixies B-Side compilation, which contains a different version). <br /> <br />Bossanova is the Pixies at their most accessible.  Only Rock Music displays the \\"scary\\" side to the Pixies- otherwise Mr Francis' love of sixties pop and surf guitar comes to the fore.  But so what?  Some people complain that Kim Deal doesn't have enough input on this album.  Well, she only contributed one song to Surfer Rosa (Gigantic) and no-one complained about her lack of input there.  I think the negative perception of Bossanova is just music snobbery- people who don't like their alternative band crossing over to the mainstream, like people who think that REM's IRS albums were better than Automatic For the People (yeah, right).   <br /> <br />Just buy this album, play it on a sunny day in summer, kick back and enjoy...
B000BMSTMS|4.0|I have listened to this album enough by this point to get a solid feel for where it's coming from and where Korn went with this project. There is NO WAY possible to fully realize this disc with one or two listens.  <br /> These guys are not the 20 year old beer drinking neanderthals they used to be........so why would they release another album trying to sound like it? This is Korn in 2005. Updated, grown up, sober (for the most part), and for the first time in a while; creative. This album is solid start to finish and offers rewards with repeated listens. <br /> <br />1- Twisted Transistor:  <br />Catchiest song on the album, pretty hard guitar riff, pounding drum beat, great vocals. Obviously the best choice for a single. <br /> <br />2- Politics:  <br />This song kind of loses me at points. It has potential to be the best song on the album, but never comes around. Decent riffs and OK vocals.  <br /> <br />3- Hyocrites:  <br />The \\"Korn-iest\\" song on the album. Sounds like a morph between the style of Follow the Leader and self titled. Simple rhythm, but still kicks ass. Classic Korn. <br /> <br />4-Souvineir:  <br />Thought it was ok at first. F*ckin love it now. Great start to finish. Listen to a few times, it'll grow on ya quickly. Very original, like nothing Korn has ever done.  <br /> <br />5-10 or A 2-Way: <br />Again, another song that definitely grows on ya. Goes into a different universe at about 2 mins in. Experimental and original as f*ck. Love it. <br /> <br />6-Throw Me Away: <br />A lot of people are pleading \\"NIN RIP OFF!\\" Screw that. It is industrial, but its catchy as hell and WAYYYYY better than anything off the new NIN album, and I love that album. Much heavier than NIN and no one sounds like JD. <br /> <br />7-Love Song: <br />Currently, my favorite song on the album. This is the result of all the experimentation and exploring coming full circle. Like nothing Korn has ever done and will easily be a concert fav if they decide to play it. 2 minsin it turns into a beast. Love it. <br /> <br />8-Open Up: <br />Catchy as hell and Fieldy goes nuts on the bass. Gotta love that. Definitely can see it on the play lists of every strip club. This song is pure sex. <br /> <br />9-Coming Undone:  <br />Easily the next single. Not the best song for my tastes, but it'll get people spinnin the record everywhere. A definite sing a long with some catchy riffs. <br /> <br />10-Getting Off: <br />One case of bad ass music mixed with OK lyrics/ melody. Couldve been in the running for the best song on the record but not quite. Awesome job by the band though. <br /> <br />11-Liar: <br />Another classic Korn style tune. Hard, to the point, and catchy. <br /> <br />12-For No One: <br />One of my favs. Fieldy goes nuts again and JD lays down the vocals perfectly.  <br /> <br />13-Seen It All: <br />I agree with the amazon.com review. Should have been the last song on the album. Could've been a great closer. Its a beast in it's own. Another tune completely original.  <br /> <br />14-Tearjerker: <br />Good song, but ends the album on a down point. Down as in brings you down. It really is a tear jerker. Shouldve been a b-side. <br /> <br />Overall, great effort. New sounds, new riffs, new lyrical approach, new producer, etc. Still sounds like Korn yet opens some new doors. They can go anywhere from here. I would love to see them expand on the Souvineir/ Love Song/ Seen it All style. My only complaint is that \\"Its Me Again\\" and \\"Last Legal Drug\\" were left off of the album. I added them to it and burned my own mix and the album plays much smoother with those 2 additions. Definitely worth picking up the Deluxe Edition. <br />
B000002L82|5.0|After Technique, Power, Corruption & Lies is the next best New Order album.  Fragile, delicate, tentative, its the band blinking into the sunlight after the shadows of Joy Division.  The opener Age of Consent is a racy opener which declares the band's identity as different from Movement's pseudo-Joy Division gloom.  There are plenty of other highlights.  We All Stand ambles along sleepily, Your Silent Face is is delicately sombre, Ecstacy features some shimmering drum-work from Steven Morris, and Leave Me Alone is one of the best songs New Order have ever written- a beautiful bitter-sweet lament driven by Hook's two-note bassline.  Its a pity that the US version contains Blue Monday, which I think spoils the flow of the album, which is delicate and tentative, wheareas Blue Monday is such an obvious hit single- a stormer which I dont think fits with the rest of the album.  New Order left it off the intial release, and for good reason.  But, as one of the other reviewers says, maybe I shouldn't be such a purist!
B0007N1AI6|5.0|only MUCH harder! Overall, if you are a fan of Judas Priest from Stained Class all the way up to Painkiller, you will not be disappointed AT all. The album is a classic Priest recording in nature, but it sounds somewhat modernized. For example, opener \\"Judas Rising\\" is very much reminescent of earlier speed metal numbers like \\"Exciter,\\" Freewheel Burning,\\" and \\"Metal Meltdown,\\" though unlike those tracks, it builds at the beginning (\\"Metal Meltdown\\" does sort of too, but it builds quickly). Track 2, \\"Deal With The Devil,\\" brings back the feel of those classic straightforward rockers like \\"Breaking The Law,\\" \\"Hot Rockin',\\" and \\"You've Got Another Thing Coming.\\" It's got that simple beat/riff, and the vocals don't need to wail to show that Halford's on the money! \\"Revolution,\\" the leadoff single, is reminiscent of their fist-pumping numbers, particularly \\"Heavy Duty.\\" That slow paced boom-chick boom-chick drum beat is all you need to make a great fist-pumping anthem, rockers and heavy metallers alike! The bottom line: Priest are TRULY back this time! No Ripper bs like last time. BUY THIS!
B00005JNTX|1.0|This review refers to the earlier single-disc edition that was released back in August. As much as I am lauding the special edition that is released a mere few months later, I abhorred the way Disney/Miramax treat their clients and customers with such contempt. Do they hate the consumers so much that they expect all of us to double dip each of their title that is released? Luckily, when I purchased this single disc edition, it was at a huge discount from Amazon, if not, I wouldn't have bothered even casting a glance at its cover.
0783225849|5.0|This is a classic film...Anthony Perkins delivers one of the best and most haunting performances of all time as \\"Norman Bates\\" a lonely son of a deranged old woman...the psychological relationship beetween the characters is very intense and we feel intimate with them it is as if we are in the room with them...it is a \\"simple\\" movie made for less then a million dollars that still manages to be better then all of the \\"movies\\" of our days thanks to it's masterful film making by the master Hichcock...the murder shower scene wheire the naked body is on the floor with the blood mixed to the water going down the drain and the face of the victim on the floor is at the same time chilling and artistic...and of course their is  the haunting final scene that will stick in your mind forever...  Watch the movie from the very begining Hitch would of wanted it that way...wink
B0002O06N0|5.0|On their third and best album, the Black Keys consistently prove that they can do classic blues rock better than classic blues rock did.  No matter what your musical taste, it is hard to deny the raw vocals and perfectly distorted guitar of Dan Auerback and the powerful beats of drummer Pat Carney.  This album goes from more raw blues on tracks like \\"Grown So Ugly\\", to catchy, radio friendly songs such as \\"Act Nice and Gentle\\", it even explores the realm of somber rock ballads on the track titled \\"The Lengths.\\"  The band pulls off all of these styles extremely well putting their own spin on every track. <br />     This album lives up to and surpasses its two predecessors.  There is not one bad track.  If you listen and find you appreciate the raw garage band sound of the Black Keys, do whatever you can to see them live.  You will be blown away by how the Black Keys can perform such a loud, energetic show as a two-piece band.  As Dan Auerback moves to the rise and fall of every sound his guitar makes, Pat Carney can barely keep from knocking his high hat symbol over.  We can only hope that the Black Keys keep releasing albums that rock as hard as this one. <br />
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I was late on the Firefly/Serenity bandwagon.  I had a hundred dollar gift certificate to Best Buy, saw the Firefly DVD, remembered seeing a preview of Serenity, thought it was cool, and bought the DVD.  I watched all the shows in a week and was hooked.  I had high expectations for the movie and it met them.  Fantastic movie that I believe worked on every level.  Buy the DVD!
B00003CXCT|2.0|bottom line the changes suck.  I origionally saw Star Wars with the re-release of the \\"SE\\" versions in the 90's.  Now. I also own a 3 movie box set of the origional versions.  I like them better.  They flow better, the acting and the storytelling was excellent.  Plus, my favorite music in the entire saga, except for perhaps Duel of the Fates, is the \\"yub yub\\" song thing at the end of ROTJ.  Do yourself a favor and go on E-bay and get the origional version.  The special features were not worth the money, considering that if I just want to watch the movie, I still prefer to see the origional versions and deal w/ the VHS.  If only Lucas would reach down, pull hard, and mabee he'll see the light of day again.  Granted, putting in HC and Ian McDarmond was acceptable, as was the BoY fix.  The rest was crap.
B000089RVX|5.0|This band rocks!  I come from the old school of music when there were actually guitar solos and lead singers that could really sing.  When alternative music came out, I was pretty bummed out.  Then I heard Evanescence, and fell in love with Amy Lee's haunting vocals and the heavy, guitar-driven music.  I don't know what influences this band has, but I hear some Queensryche in Evanescence.<br /><br />I put this c.d. on while I am writing, and my creativity takes off.  Thank you, Evanescence!<br /><br />I love the whole c.d., but my favorites are:<br /><br />Going Under for the heavy guitar riffs.<br /><br />Imaginary for the lyrics-\\"I linger in the doorway, of alarm clock screaming, monsters call my name, let me stay, where the wind will whisper to me, where raindrops, as they're falling tell a story.\\"<br /><br />Taking Over Me for the haunting melody.<br /><br />All of the songs have haunting melodies that stir the soul.  If you like heavy guitar riffs mixed with haunting, four octave vocals, then Evanescence is the band for you.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|If you enjoyed the recent offerings of Audioslaves \\"Out of exile\\" , Foo Ffighters' \\"In your honour\\", Coldplays \\"X&Y\\" and even Green Days \\"American Idiot\\" you will love this album. Uniqueness drips from every verse these Armenian rockers have to offer! The songs are melodic and furious, both at the same time. \\"Attack\\" and \\"Dreaming\\" are hard and full of rage - a great beginning. \\"Attack\\" has an absolutely lovely build up to the powerful chant of attack! attack! \\"Dreaming\\" foloows in the vein of its predecessor - fast and heavy with stages of beautiful and serene singing in between. \\"Kill Rock and Roll\\" made me laugh  hysterically with its use of the Ass**** word , but on repeated listenings, this song has the best tune and melody of the set. \\"Hypnotize\\" literally has two hypnotizing guitar solos  but is a little weak on lyrics. \\"Stealing society\\" is the fastest song on the album whereas \\"Tentative\\" acheives its purpose of depressing a person with its haunting tune. \\"U-fig\\" - no offense S.O.A.D - would make many luagh iwth the chorus sounding a little childish.   The next song is a rock ballad lamenting about cheating and spirituality, \\"Vicinity of obscenity\\" and \\"She's like heroin\\" are totally forgettable. \\"Lonely Day\\" has got to be the strongest song - sturdy lyrics and great instrumentalisation. the last song  brings the album to another high point - a perfect end although departing from the fast pace the rest of the album maintains.  <br />All in all, this album is great to listen to, S.O.A.D  prove they are impossible to categorize! Recommended to anyone who is interested in an originality with no comparison
0316168815|3.0|Likely I would have given this book a higher rating had I first read Alice Sebold's true memoir, entitled Lucky. It would have helped me to understand the depth of emotion with which The Lovely Bones was written. Perhaps The Lovely Bones only failed to be a \\"great\\" book in my mind because its press had prepared me for something incredible. It wasn't. Alice Sebold's writing style was appealing enough to give her the second chance, though, and I was pleased enough to have read both. I'll remember her other book for much longer.  <br />
B0000057C5|5.0|I think we all know Rammstein epic \\"Du Hast\\". But that isn't their only good one. This CD is full of great songs and spectacular riffs. Without Rammstein, industial metal would not be anywere or may not ever exist. <br />Yes, you should buy this album and some other Rammstein classics.
0060839872|4.0|First off, let me say I can see why this book is considered a modern classic. It delves deeply, and methodically, into the current human condition and how people are taught how to look at the world.    However, if you're looking for a casual read into Zen philosophy this book isn't for you. This book took me a while to get through. Much longer than it normally takes me for a book of this length. The \\"rhetoric\\" can be very complex and complicated at times, but it necessary for the depths the book is meant to examine. Pirsig examines the most basic, fundamentaly, and ancient ways of the modern Western Civilzation thought process.
B000BVD460|1.0|What is this? An Eminem greatest hits CD? He had hits I'm sure, but it's not about having a \\"hit\\". It's about writing and performing quality music. Eminem doesn't write or perform music. He essentually talks into a microphone and gets millions while talented bands like Lamb of God (or Burn the Priest), Behemoth,  Stratovarius, In Flames, Megadeth, Superjoint Ritual, Shadows Fall, Trivium, Slayer even Metallica have to work to write amazing riffs ,solos, and complex drum patterns. Also Eminem ripped off Aerosmtih on the song \\"Sing for the Moment\\". Sorry Eminem but you suck.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|\\"Firefly\\" is nothing short of incredible!  Great cast, great dialog, and amazing stories.  There is not a single bad episode in the entire series; in fact, I can not think of a show in recent memory that has had this much charm.   <br /> <br />What amazes me more than anything else is the chemistry that this cast has with one another!  I can not recommend this box set more highly.   <br /> <br />
B00005JO1S|4.0|Once `Jumanji' brought us an adventure story in deep jungle (deep jungle in your house, to be precise). Now its updated version `Zathura' arrives, which is about a `space adventure' by two brothers Walter and Danny. The boys are stranded in the outer space (with unsuspecting sister in her room) after starting the game of the film's title. To go back to the Earth alive, they have to finish the game, pushing the red `GO' button, one player after the other. Unfortunately, however, Walter and Danny are not always co-operative, both having a quarrel with each other. <br /> <br />Yes, `Zathura' is about an old game found in the basement in the brothers' house, and Danny accidentally becomes the first player of it. Unlike `Jumanji' in which wild animals of the jungle rush into your living room, the game of `Zathura' transports the entire house into the outer space, where many life-threatening events happen to the brothers. After the rather weak initial 15 minutes which introduce the family (including their father Tim Robbins, and sister Kristen Stewart), `Zathura' keeps entertaining us like a roller coaster despite some slack moments. <br /> <br />Though the appearance of Tim Robbins is too short, which is little better than a cameo, Dax Shepard provides a good support as a stranded astronaut, who is probably better than the over-the-top Robin Williams in 'Jumanji'. The two child actors Josh Hutcherson and Jonah Bobo are also good, though I find some part of their acting (especially when quarrelling) is irritating and overdone.  <br /> <br />`Zathura''s simple premise is based on the book of the same title, beautifully illustrated one by Chris Van Allsburg (`The Polar Express' and of course, `Jumanji'). And the story resembles those of them - children learning a precious thing or two about family or life itself after the incredible and imaginative adventures set in another world. Some viewers would complain, perhaps with good reasons, that the script of `Zathura' (by DavidKoepp and John Kamps) recycles some elements from `Jumaji.' I understand, but you know, both of the films are based on the same concept - kids playing a potentially deadly board game - so let's ignore the resemblance. And the predictability of the `game' should also be forgiven because, as you know, all the games of this type will end in only one way. <br /> <br />You may not praise actor-turned-director Jon Favreau for inventiveness and originality, but it must be said too that he succeeds in imbuing the old-fashioned feeling into the film, which, in spite of plot holes and some unnecessary slapsticks, turns out a delightful, well-told tale for children and adults alike. The film is greatly helped by the first-rate CGIs, but the real charms of `Zathura' are its touch of the good old sci-fi films in the 50s. Don't expect `Star Wars: Episode III' here; `Zathura' is like one upgraded version of the original TV `Star Trek,' sometimes corny but ultimately joyful and optimistic adventure story.
B000805796|5.0|Melanie C has really done it here.  My brother always says that she is a \\"poser\\" for doing rock songs, but I don't agree.  She is just doing what comes naturally.  The lyrics are so meaningful and honest that I can tell that she put a lot of effort into this.  She has experienced everything on this album and I commend her for putting it out there.   <br /> <br />Her music has really gotten me through a lot of tough times.  Her lyrics and even the background music either picks me up, consoles me, or both at the same time.   <br /> <br />\\"Beautiful Intentions\\" should be out here in the US.  Bottum line.  The US is ready for her again, and I think that she will do well. There are those that will dismiss her, and those who would say bad things about her and her music.  Forget them, because she stopped caring about those people a long time ago, and we, her fans, should not either.
B00007LTIA|5.0|I'm updating my original review to include the two studio run-throughs added to the newer edition.  I'm a big fan of the original TFTO and I think the studio run-throughs are a brilliant addition.  These are recordings of Jon and the boys playing these amazing songs in the studio, live, without any multi-tracking.  These are fresh takes, not the original ones stripped-down.  The result is that you hear YES the band, as if they were playing in your living room.  It's a little pared-down (no vocal harmonies, for example), but it's simply fascinating to hear them pull it off, just 5 guys and their instruments.  And it's all done in the controlled environment of the studio, without all the distractions and detractions of a live concert.  Again, it's brilliant!  Original Review:  If you're not a Yes fan I'm not sure why you'd be here considering buying what is probably the most unique rock album of all time.  And if you're already a fan you probably don't need convincing.  This is classical music done with rock instruments and rock sensibility.  It's not something you're gonna throw in your car stereo and fall in love with immediately.  But if you like the song &#34;Close to the Edge&#34;, you'll love this album.  And as with &#34;CTTE&#34; you'll need at least a year and a few false starts before the gods finally find you fit enough to allow the greatness begin to seep into your blood.
B000BVEKO0|5.0|This cd is incredible. I didn't know what to imagine with HEAD leaving and all but this cd is great. Make sure you buy the cd with the bonus disc, because the extra songs are great. This cd will not disappoint you at all.

B00005JO9J|5.0|When teasers were first aired for this show last season, I couldn't have been less interested.  I wasn't familiar with any of the main actors so no one caught my attention nor am I particularly fond of \\"hospital\\" shows.  I made no effort to catch the pilot but somehow found myself in front of the television when it came on.  After the first 15 minutes, I was seriously hooked and haven't dared to miss an episode since -- it's THAT good!  This is the only television show I actually watch while it's airing.  Normally, if I want to watch something, I'll record it for later viewing (commercials drive me crazy) but \\"Grey's Anatomy\\" is the one show I HAVE to watch along with 20+ million other people in America.  I love all of the regular characters and am consistently amazed by their overall chemistry with each other.  Having said that, I am especially impressed by, and adore, Sandra Oh who plays Cristina Yang.  In a stellar cast, she is a standout.  She's acerbic, witty, carelessly abrupt and totally unlearned in the art of diplomacy, but in her few moments of vulnerability (usually with the coolly skillful Dr. Burke or with her \\"sister\\"/close friend Meredith), she has been wonderful and touching.  She deserves an Emmy -- they're all so good but she is a consistent scene stealer.  Her timing and delivery are perfect.  As Cristina, she always makes me laugh but she sometimes also breaks my heart.  I had never seen any of Sandra's work before but am a fan of hers for life now.  She and the tough but nurturing Dr. Miranda Bailey, along with sweet but awkward George O'Malley, are my absolute favorites in a cast that has melded together into a well-oiled machine.  I cannot praise this show or its talented cast enough and it seems I'm not in the minority here.  I'm pleased to learn that so many others love and have embraced this show and all of the flawed but endearing characters as much as I have.  Can't wait for the DVDs of last season and this season.  If you haven't watchedthis show yet, give it a chance -- more than likely, you'll be impressed.
B000BVEKO0|5.0|KoRns  new album SEE YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE is amazing to say the least. This album is completely different from any album put out by KoRn before. So it doesnt matter weather your a KoRn fans or not its sure to impress you. Some of my favorite songs are THROW ME AWAY, SOMING UNDONE, and I'VE SEEN IT ALL. Not only do you get 14 AWSOME tracks but you get a bonus disc With 7 other songs! and a free 1 year membership to but BSC wich is KoRn fan club. So all in all i'd recommend this album to anyone.
B000BM6AVA|2.0|These guys are capable of much better. Although Darron can't sing, mesmerize was still a good album in my opinion. This album is just kind of there, it does not really grab you. I'm sure if I listened enough times there might be something that grabs me, but what a waste of time, as is with this album.
B000AADYRQ|2.0|When I heard that Death Cab was coming out with a new album, I was excited, not only because I enjoyed Transatlanticism, but I also loved what Ben Gibbard did in the Postal service.  There is a great sound that death cab possesses, though quite poppy at times, it seemed to grasp an individuality that I was looking for, so I waited eagerly for the day the album was to be released.  When it came out, I waited a week, and instead of buying it right away, I borrowed a copy from a friend, emphatically telling me that they were \\"the best thing ever.\\"  I knew from previous experience that I was going to have to listen through the album several times in order to get a feel for it, so over the course of three or four days I bonded with it, and I came to some new conclusions about the band.  There are some good songs on Plans, I won't deny them that, I especially enjoyed \\"I will follow you into the dark,\\" and \\"Someday you will be loved,\\" but what I kept saying to myself the whole time I was listening to this album was, \\"Hey, haven't I heard this song before? Wasn't this on their last album?\\" <br />    Here's the deal with death cab.  They are too reliant on catchy melodies and consumer oriented lyrics.  And their songs all sound the same!  I still love em, but I won't buy any more of their cd's because I just have to buy one.  What the hell, I'll give it a 2.5 just for \\"I'll follow you..\\"
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|Unless you are going to include EVERY Michael Jackson song and EVERY demo and EVERY B-Side and EVERY Remix, you can't call any collection of Michael Jackson's music \\"The Ultimate Collection\\" but the normally sloppy Sony Records did a nice try with this package. <br /> <br />Out of all the \\"Best Of\\" Michael Jackson stuff flooding the market these days, this is the best. <br /> <br />Why? <br /> <br />Well for starters it includes some awesome unreleased stuff from different eras (Sunset Driver, Monkey Business, In The Back) <br /> <br />All the usual Michael hits are here (Except Scream and a few others from HIStory *Disc 2*) <br /> <br />It even offers a very interesting remix on 'Who Is It\\" (I like Michael's album version better - but the remix is an interesting change of pace.) <br /> <br />The new songs are AWESOME. (The Way You Love Me & We've Had Enough) are just proof enough that Michael never lost his talent and still has it. <br /> <br />The concert DVD shows Michael moonwalking, shaking and singing his heart out from the Dangerous tour. (Must see performances of Billie Jean and Human Nature make this concert a must.) <br /> <br />Personally, I'm still hoping one day Michael releases either a full album of vaulted songs. Because, honestly, some of the vaulted songs on this package (Sunset Driver, Monkey Business & more) are awesome! While they sound dated, they still hold up better than 95% of the music being put out today. And that says a lot. <br /> <br />Will The King of Pop stand up? Welcome to the stage Michael Jackson. Or in this case your CD player. Buy The Ultimate Collection and you will have Michael's hits waiting for you to discover over and over again along with some vaulted songs and new stuff! Ultimate Collection - Nah, not hardly. Awesome Collection - Without a doubt!  Cheers!
B00003CXCT|5.0|Yes, I grew up with these three wonderful movies - I saw them all during their original theatrical releases way back when and they have had a profound impact on me.<br /><br />I don't mind the changes Lucas has made for their \\"Special Edition\\" theatrical releases, nor the further changes on these DVDs. I feel neutral on some of them, and others (such as the new music at the end of \\"Return of the Jedi\\") I think are a definite improvement on the originals. Undoubtedly, these changes make these three films a more cohesive whole with Episodes I - III.<br /><br />The movies themselves are all excellent, and the only one I find slightly flawed is \\"Return of the Jedi\\" - it's a fine film, and it just isn't quite as good as \\"A New Hope\\" or \\"The Empire Strikes Back.\\"<br /><br />The DVD transfers are superb, and the extra disc of bonus material is bountiful. A minor complaint about this stellar release, is that I do wish that there had been even more extras when there was so much available. I for one would love to see the original, \\"Making of Star Wars\\" special that was aired on television in 1977 and hosted by R2D2 and C3P0. The extras which are provided are excellent - I just wish there were more when I know more do exist.<br /><br />This a wonderful and very welcome DVD release.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|this movie is raw, filled with action and mystery. if you ever play FFVII it still a must have. it will keep me washing for ever. yet still there something that make me wonder will there be a sequel to this movie. i mean this movie left me still asking question....who zack, who sister, and will seprioth stay a memory or live again.
B000ASDFJU|3.0|Opinions are like....well you know and after reading a certain someones less then stellar review of this show, it just made me want to purchase this box set even more for my Fiancee.   She goes on to, badly, rate several other movies like Pretty woman.  And she complains about several others as well. Seems like someone is jealous or maybe its just the fact these films are above her intelligence level. I am willing to bet she is a holier then thou type and probably the type of person to yell at a person for spanking their child in public.   Thanks for selling me on this box set with your *yaawwwnnn* review.  And lady if you think thats what all New Yorkers and the city of NY is like, maybe you should leave your house once in a while.  But as the saying goes, Let those who are without sin cast the first stone.
B00000GAIW|5.0|Jethro Tull broke through to success with this their first masterpiece. I liked the album from before BENEFIT a lot but this is the one that got tons of radio airplay. I still like albums like SONGS FROM THE WOOD, BROADSWORD AND THE BEAST, STORMWATCH, and HEAVY HORSES a little bit better. My favorite tune on this one is &#34;Cross-eyed Mary&#34; followed by &#34;Aqualung&#34;, &#34;Locomotive Breath&#34;, &#34;Wind-Up, Cheap Day Return, Mother Goose, and &#34;Up to me&#34;. Though still, they do deserve some credit for making a great album, and many fans count it as number one in their discography. I really can't blame them for making that assessment. I would wholeheartedly recommend this as one of your first Tull purchases. Enjoy!!!
B000002HJR|5.0|I love pantera, c.o.c.,and crowbar.If you wanna call this a side project, it don't sound like one. I've listened to this album for ten years and it gets better every time.In my opinion, phil does his best with down and I feel the same about Pepper and Kirk. I would say it sounds more like c.o.c. than pantera or crowbar, for yaws that are interested in buying it. But if you like any of those bands, get this and Down II.
B00070DK14|5.0|I don't know what happened Amazon, but you deleted the review of Broadsword that I did a few days ago, so I guess I'll give it another shot! This is the second Tull album that I listened to in it's entirety, and boy is this a gem. This recording is right up there with SONGS FROM THE WOOD and STORMWATCH as my favorite offerings of Jethro Tull. I guess you could say those three are tied for #1 with me. At least it did do well in Europe and especially Germany but it's puzzling how it got ignored in the United States. It was released for 3 years before I knew anything about it!!' Some Tull fans say that this is a horrible release, but I can't see why they would think ill of this great stuff!!!! This is great cutting edge progressive rock. Some people love the worst of the Tull catalog, and hate the best of it. I just love the whole kind of medieval vibe that exists throughout this cd. I just bought this remaster with the 8 bonus tracks, and it sounds a great deal better than the one that I had purchased in the mid-80's. The 80's vinyl sounded warmer and crisper than the first cd issue but this 2005 cd remaster blows the vinyl away!!! I understand that they recorded 8 or more tracks in addition to the original tracks at these sessions, so that's why this has so many bonus tracks. A few of these bonus tracks sound pretty excellent, but I see why they thought that they wouldn't fit the original album. I think the best songs are &quot;Watching me, watching you&quot;, &quot;Pussywillow&quot;, &quot;Broadsword&quot;, &quot;The Clasp&quot;, &quot;Fallen on hard times&quot;, and &quot;Flying colours&quot;. On their next release Under Wraps they would be on a definite decline from this, but they got back on track with Crest of a Knave in 1987. So hush up you haters of BROADSWORD, and go to music school or have a lobotomy, because you're not thinking right in my book! Enjoy!!!
B000AADYYO|5.0|Short and to the point. How do people write music like this.This album is amazing. So is Blackwater Park. I think it sounds the most like B.P. All 8 Opeth albums are worth buying.
B00008G9JN|5.0|This was the first Jethro Tull cd that I ever heard played all the way through, and I'll tell you that I was just completely mesmerized at the incredible sound quality and instrumentation that this classic album had. I like the whole folk vibe that this album has all the way through it. This album is really up my alley as far as the feel of the album goes. I just love the songs &#34;Velvet Green&#34;, &#34;Songs from the Wood&#34;, &#34;Cup of Wonder&#34;, &#34;Pibroch (cap in hand)&#34;, &#34;Ring Out, Soltice Bells&#34;, &#34;The Whistler&#34;, and &#34;Hunting Girl&#34;. I've always really dug the cover of the album too! This was sort of a comeback album after the substandard preceding album TOO OLD TO ROCK AND ROLL TOO YOUNG TO DIE. They've never made a recording that had this quality of songs combined with ultra-pristine sound quality. This is just a very special Tull album and really one of the best albums ever recorded by a rock group period!!! I've had a few friends that were kind of into their more commercial stuff like AQUALUNG, but don't think Songs is a that great a recording, but I guess they're not really paying attention to this masterpiece. If you're a Tull fan and you don't like this one, you're really not a Tull fan!!!<br /><br />P.S. 1-15-2014 A few years ago I bought the remaster with &#34;Beltane&#34; as one of the bonus tracks and it does improve on the sound quality of the original vinyl and cd incarnations. I didn't think that it would be an improvement but I guess they're making better remasters in these latter days. It has a real crisp treble response but the bass is definitely there too and it's just a joy to listen to. &#34;Beltane&#34; is a fine song but it isn't quite in the league of all the songs on the album proper. Still, it's a fine bonus along<br /> with &#34;velvet green&#34; played live (I'm not sure if it came from BURSTING OUT, but it's played very well).<br /><br />P.S. 4-23-2017- I've compared the original issue with this new remaster and I think the original is more natural sounding and the remaster has a strong treble bite to it. So;I'm thinking that the first issue might beat the remaster by a little.the original is more natural sounding and the remaster has a strong treble bite to it.

B00001ZULV|5.0|What more could you want from a compilation? Yes, there is not enough songs from the earlier years with Peter Gabriel and Phil Collins dominates this whole thing, but this is a \\"hits\\" CD. I'm just a casual Genesis fan, but I'm still pretty sure that they didn't have too many hits during their early/progressive rock years. That's amazing considering \\"Selling England By The Pound,\\" \\"The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway,\\" \\"Nursery Cryme,\\" etc. were all really good albums! It would be great if they would make a best of disc with just the songs from when Gabriel was in the band, to go with this compilation. They don't though, so maybe you should just go with the 3 disc Platinum Collection if you like both the progressive and the pop years.  <br /> <br />I won't go into the songs on here, because everybody has probably heard over half of these overplayed on the radio. It's kind of like U2's \\"With or Without You,\\" and \\"Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For.\\" They are really good songs, but you can get burned out on them from hearing them on the radio way too many times. Anyway, if you like 80's pop and Phil Collin's solo music, then this hits collection is a must. If you just like the Peter Gabriel years and progressive rock, then you'll want to stay clear the hell away from this! There is a big difference in the music.
0553801503|4.0|A Feast For Crows is an excellent story--an *almost* worthy follow-up to A Storm of Swords.  The story does indeed take a while to get going, hindered mostly by Martin's almost obsessive naming of who is in the camp, who is in the hall, whose ancestory was this, etc.  Once I was able to let go of the need to read and try to place every single person being named (and I do think Martin's gotten a little too enthralled with all the naming) I was able to settle into this novel with enjoyment.  It would be easy to nitpick; of course I wanted those other Points of View that are missing, but I wanted the book NOW and I got it, for good or ill.  The new POVs were at times confusing but I feel confident Martin is setting us up for even more exciting events in the next few books.  I loved the growth of Sansa's character; she's scarcely recognizable from the immature young girl of A Game of Thrones.  Arya's fate left me shaking my head in disbelief, and Jaime's POV left me even more in awe of how my opinion of him has changed for the better.  I admit I wasn't looking forward to Cersei's POV; I was truly afraid Martin would make her sympathetic and that was something I did not want to face.  Thankfully Martin knew better and gave me what I actually needed--insight into her truly cold-hearted personality.  Finally, I too was not enraptured by Brienne's POV, but hopefully we've not seen the end of her because I can foresee major conflict ahead.<br /><br />Overall, while this book is not my favorite in the series, I did enjoy it and find myself still pondering over the characters and events many days after completing the story.  I do believe this book is mostly set-up for what's to come; necessary information that Martin will hopefully tie up neatly. The \\"extra\\" POV of Dany at the end was one of the highlights that has left me craving more in this excellent series.  Let's just hope Martin gets over his obsession with names and ancestry or moves it on into another series entirely.<br /><br />Highly recommended.ly. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.

0060594888|5.0|Having spent over a decade as a personal trainer, I've come to understand that a book like \\"The Success Principles\\" is just what is needed to ensure success.  So many people think that exercise books or new techniques are what are needed, but that's only a small part.  Jack Canfield starts right out saying that one must take 100% responsibility for one' life.  How true!  Phrases like \\"no excuses\\" and \\"put in the time\\" are so appropriate.<br /><br />Since my focus is on fitness...if you are looking to reach your health and fitness goals, I encourage you to read this book, and do the exercises.<br /><br />Stephen Cooper, Certified Personal Trainer
0679422714|1.0|Any book like this is stupid. Mao made a lot of mistakes that is true. People suffered during the culture revolution and things like that. However any sane historian should also see the much more bright side of Mao. People suffer much more before Mao and without Mao people in China right now might possibly live miserably. This book is just a simple and stupid American/Western point of view without fully understanding of China. So I agreed, this book should change its title to I HATE MAO.
B000002UAU|1.0|In my opinion, this was the worst mastering I have ever heard of a classic album.  Especially a Beatles album. Vocals and instruments faded in and out or are missing altogether.  Doesn't anyone listen to these before they are sold to the public?  The poor mixing and production were no where close to the vinyl original in what I consider a blasphemy.  I know this album by heart and as a long time musician I am sorely dissapointed.
0061020680|3.0|I am truly addicted to Terry Pratchett's books, though this particular one was kind of ho hum, nothing much interesting happening and Mort seemed not too bright.  I do love Terry's books about Commander Vimes and the Watch a lot better and am just waiting for a new one to appear.  Please????  Also like Granny Weatherwax, et al.  Perhaps Mort may appear at another time with some interesting plot line(s).
B000BVEKO0|5.0|twisted transistor the first song off the new album it is awson i like it very much bought it 2 weeks before it came out if you dont have it you need ot go buy it if you like korn as much as me you will like it too
B000B7BRMM|1.0|If you long for the sound of someone just going through the motions this may be the disc for you. I was thrilled with Krall's first album - I even used it when shopping for a new set of speakers. Since then I've been lukewarm on her releases. My wife purchased her Christmas album and after listening to it in the car for several hours I know what a very talented artist sounds like when they are less than enthused about a project.
B0002CHIJW|4.0|What's with everyone giving their dissertations like this is a college class? If you're reading these reviews, you know what the film is about, or at least you've heard of the film. This one is sick and it lives up to its reputation. The men raping poor Camile Keaton isn't repulsive. The way she kills them off one by one isn't repugnant, either (although kudos to the bathtub scene - Ouch!). It's the demise and slow decay of her charachter's persona onscreen that's disturbing. Her innocence and naivety being replaced by the madness and pain brewing within her which would only be repressed and quieted by committing these horrendous crimes is the core of the story. If you're an ultra-gore fan, check this out. If you don't think you can handle something like this, chances are, you won't be able to.
B00020HEL6|5.0|This 15 year old took a chance on recording a grown-up cd and I, being 35 years old, cannot get enough of this talented teen.  She's got an angelic voice/presence/talent and I sincerly hope that she continues to keep up the choices she has made....  I've got this cd in mass quantity, in my car, home, office, bought copies for co-workers, etc.  Love you, Renee.
B000059PPN|4.0|Love Lucio Fulci. Love this film. It's an absurb little piece of Italian cinema, but it's pretty darn good. It's a little slow at the beginning, but be patient mon freres....it'll get really good soon. :) :)
B00007AJF9|4.0|You can read the other customer reviews to see why this movie is so fantastic, rich in costumes, scenery, acting, drama, etc. My only qualm is that I have actually studied the life and person of Queen Elizabeth I and she never needed anyone's help to \\"become\\" strong nor was it ever CONFIRMED that she was or was NOT a virgin. Believe it or not, this young woman, when her life was in danger by her own sister and otherwise, was savy in politics and in what she should and shouldn't say and how she should or shouldn't act. This is not to say she was cold-hearted - she did at times let certain Earl's play with her heart-strings, but she cut them (and whoever she had to) off in order to stay the great monarch that she was...ALONE. I understand that it makes the movie more interesting to make her this vunerable \\"ruling with her heart\\" girl who GROWS INTO the strong Queen we've all heard about. But to be honest - she already was that smart and didn't need the help of all of those men to BECOME that way. <br /> <br />Other than that little complaint - the movie is utterly WONDERFUL. Her coronation scene looks like a famous painting of the Queen COME TO LIFE. They even included her favorite \\"scandalous\\" dance - the Volta! I recommend this movie to everyone, but please give this woman credit for being strong from the very beginning despite her age - she deserves it!
B000068IEU|5.0|Do we really need to read a review where the reviewer refers to naked female body parts as \\"jubblies\\"? cookieman, we all know a horror/exploitation film such as this one has the compulsory T & A...it's just common knowledge.<br /><br />This film is Wes Craven's debut. Disturbing on many levels. Don't dive into this one unless you're willing to go the full hog - you've been warned. If you buy the DVD at all, buy it for the fascinating interviews with Wes and Sean S. Cunningham along with the original cast (including David Hess!). Fan-freakin-tastic!
B000068VHP|5.0|When I first heard this album it was many years ago, but even now its still sounds fresh and beautiful. Doris' voice has a natural beauty about it which shines throughout the entire album and reminds you of a better, more innocent time. Great production, good lyrics and strong support from the other members. On this album, they transcended to a place reserved only for a choice few. A great piece of Art and Music.
B00005ASOI|5.0|Fantastic.<br /><br />Epic.<br /><br />Phenomenal.<br /><br />If you're a horror fan, this needs to be an essential piece in your collection. It's brilliant, as are all of Dario Argento's works. It's stylish, and brilliantly photographed. I'm not going to write a fifty page review like others down below. See this, rent this, buy this. You will not be sorry.
B000B8QF00|4.0|This is a very good greatest hits collection that came within a few songs of being great. <br /> <br />\\"The Collection\\" is the new best-of set by Alanis Morissette, and while the overall quality of the package is undeniable, there are a few glaring flaws. <br /> <br />The disc provides ample evidence that she was no one-hit (or one-album) wonder. Her post \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" career makes no apologies to that monstrous hit. The disc also demonstrates maturity and growth, which gives greatest-hits sets like this more substance, and makes them more interesting to listen to. <br /> <br />The tunes from her first album all deserve to be here, and it's a testament to that album that there are probably more songs that could be included here. The ones that are, \\"You Oughta Know, Head Over Feet, Ironic, You Learn and Hand In My Pocket\\", prove that her first album deserved to be as huge as it was. <br /> <br />Yet, the albums that came afterwards offer all sorts of great songs to this collection, and this is one of the flaws I mentioned. There are inclusions here that baffle (\\"Mercy\\", for one, belongs on a rarities or fan-club disc, not this...) and omissions that would have amplified this set immeasurably, like those should-have-been hits like \\"Precious Illusions\\", \\"So Pure\\", and \\"So Unsexy\\".  <br /> <br />She advances her song-writing skills, keeping her creative word-syllable emphasis intact (who knew the prefix \\"Un-\\" could have as many as three or four syllables?) and expanding her instrumental palette out into World Music territory. <br /> <br />There are some tremendous tunes here...\\"Hands Clean\\" reveals the girl from \\"You Oughta Know\\" to be all grown up, expressing her anger in a more controlled, cool fashion, rather than the full-blown rage of that early single. Same story, same person, all grown up. <br /> <br />\\"Thank You' still soars, \\"8 Easy Steps\\" still rocks, \\"That I Would Be Good\\" still pleads, and the epic \\"Uninvited\\" still haunts. I found the Cole Porter tune, \\"Let's Do It\\" to a cute addition to the set. <br /> <br />The best scenario may have been to split this record into two discs...a true best-of, and an odds-n-sods disc. She has plenty for both, and THAT would have been a five-star set!
0140131558|4.0|This work is actually a collection of three different stories called \\"City of Glass,\\" \\"Ghosts,\\" and \\"The Locked Room.\\"  However, upon finishing the work, it becomes rather obvious why they are all collected into one volume.<br /><br />Let me say this from the outset: If you are a person who very much needs clear closure, this book is not for you.  I don't want to get too much into the nuances of the work for fear of spoiling certain elements for a first time reader, but let's just say that this is as much an experimental exploration of theme as it is anything.<br /><br />There were times when I was quite certain that Auster had absolutely no idea what he was doing and where he was going with these stories, and there were other times when I thought I must have been reading the work of a certifiable genius.  I believe that was exactly Auster's purpose after having finished reading The New York Trilogy.<br /><br />What else can I say?  If you're a reader open to experimental craft, you will love this work; if you're a reader who needs a definite A to Z plot, I'd pass on this if I were you.  Frustrated as this book sometimes made me, it was never boring, and it made me think harder than many books I've read of late.  I believe I'm a better writer (and reader) for having experienced it.<br /><br />~Scott William Foley, author of [[ASIN:0595360823 Souls Triumphant]]
B00000ILDF|4.0|Ripley, The Alien, and an isolated prison planet full of tasty inmates. What else do you need? Weaver's first time out as Ripley had a lot more surprise in it, but this works well anyway. There's the initial tension of Ripley as the only woman among the inmates but, as one says, \\"I've taken a vow of chastity, and that includes women.\\"<br /><br />There are lots of chases in this movie, through the tech/grunge corridors of the semi-abandoned facility. Some include the vertiginous alien's-eye view as he [she?] races across walls and ceilings. Right down to the end, there's always one more gotcha from The Alien. And yes, the corporate lords are still the manipulative slimeballs they always were - you might have a better chance with The Alien than with them.<br /><br />Despite the buzz haircut and sweaty tee-shirt, Weaver looks great. Ripley is all woman, but doesn't have to wear pink to prove it. She's also the baddest on the block, Alien and murderers notwithstanding. That makes it especially amusing to see Weaver's character in the spoof movie, Galaxy Quest, an almost perfect opposite. Hard to believe the same actress did both.<br /><br />//wiredweird
0800177177|3.0|Vampire films almost by definition are parodies, just as the Victorian-era vampire story is almost by definition a metaphor for repressed sexuality. These run from the obvious (\\"Fearless Vampire Killers\\"), to the subtle (\\"Van Helsing\\"), to the self-parody (\\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\").<br /><br />Coppola's \\"Dracula\\" is a lush high budget adaptation that bears only a slight resemblance to the Bram Stoker original story. That it takes a major liberty by adding bad history to make the title character sympathetic is forgivable, in part because it adds to the self-parody element and in part because this version still incorporates the enough elements of the original-if somewhat reinterpreted to better align with the sympathetic treatment.<br /><br />The parody elements begin early when Dracula declares war on God by pushing his sword into a stone cross which then begins to flood the room with blood (yes it is as silly as it sounds). At one point Coppola breaks the conventions of the genre and allows Dracula to walk around in daylight.  Dracula's getup for this scene may have been the inspiration for Johnny Depp's Willy Wonka look. The warders in the insane asylum spend their on camera time spraying the patients with fire hoses, and they wear birdcages on their heads while performing this duty. Throughout the film, Coppola and his postproduction people parody the overuse of \\"match cut\\" transitions (i.e. when a light in the current scene cross-dissolves into a fire in the next scene) by other filmmakers. They make almost all transitions into overreaching match cuts. This is all enormous fun to watch but not as much fun as the wild performances by the cast.<br /><br />Gary Oldman, Sadie Frost, Richard E. Grant, Tom Waits, and Anthony Hopkins all overplay their characters in a nice self-parodying way. They obviously are having a whole lot of fun playing this stuff for laughs. At one point Oldman gets to wear a makeup design that would work well in a Star Trek episode. But Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder act like Coppola forgot to let them in on the joke (unless everyone in the cast is happy because they are laughing at Reeves' lame attempt at a British accent). Reeves is too limited in the talent department to pull out an over-the-top self-parodying performance. Ryder's situation is a little different, her style and strength is playing all her roles as if they are real. Although this works nicely for things like her Veronica character in \\"Heathers\\", it leaves her at the mercy of the script. Here the Mina character just doesn't have enough complexity to justify Winona's efforts.<br /><br />Speaking of Winona, she has never looked more desirable than in this film and the same can be said for Sadie Frost. This is ample justification for male viewers to seek out this film. Ryder and Frost even manage a brief passionate kiss during a cloudburst.<br /><br />There is one wonderously nice sequence where the editor cuts back and forth between Lucy's last encounter with Dracula and Nina's wedding ceremony. It is really a slick bit of film magic and a nice illustration of the sexual nature of the whole vampire genre.<br /><br />Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.ct like Coppola forgot to let them in on the joke (unless everyone in the cast is happy because they are laughing at Reeves' lame attempt at a British accent).

B00070Q8DQ|5.0|The only time that I have heard the term 'Behemoth' was in the book of Job. God refers to this massive creation as one that ranks first among the works of God, and no man can ever overpower the beast.  Poland's Behemoth back their mighty name up with talent, intensity, and a 5-star album with Demigod.<br /><br />The album opens with the wonderful track 'Sculpting the Throne ov Seth.'  The acoustic intro is followed by bone crushing blastbeats and blistering riffs with pin-point accuracy. Nergel's vocals sound great just like any current Behemoth album. The song 'Conquer All' is a fan favorite now. This is one of the most memorable songs off the album. 'Slaves Shall Serve' was very nice live and the closer 'The Reign of Shemsu-Hor' is a magnificant  epic track. The drumming done by Inferno is very elite on every track.<br /><br />For those of you who enjoy the music this band creates, you will like them ten times more live!  I saw them when they came back to Los Angeles for the Century Media 'Christmas' show when they played with Nevermore.  It was a fantastic live show.  All of the members blew everyone away with how talented they are.  Their stage presense is very good.  These Behemoths in the death metal scene have a album that has a great chance of bearing the title 'Death metal album of the year.'  This is a must-have for death metal fans.  You will NOT be dissapointed. This was my first album that I purchased...since then I have gotten 'Satanica' which is also VERY good. Demigod is definately 5-star material.
0743455967|5.0|Read this book if you love to read or write, or even if you just want a window into the mind of Stephen King.  In his memoir, King throws light onto the tools of the trade and the actual act of writing itself.     It's obvious that the guy not only knows what he is talking about when it comes to writing, but he knows how to say it in a way that anyone can understand.  King isn't trying to be trendy here.  He isn't telling you that he just sat down in a coffee shop one day, decided to become a bestselling author, and wrote The Stand.  He is telling you that writing fiction is a job, and if you want to do this job, it's one that you had better be passionate about.  After reading this book you will understand the seriousness that writing fiction demands.       It's odd, but this was the first Stephen King book I have ever read.  It won't be the last, that's for sure. (Even if he is a Red Sox fan.)
B0002MG9SI|5.0|un film  regarder durant cette priode de Nol. Emouvant et plein de bons sentiments mais sans pourtant tomber dans le 'cul-cul la praline'. Comme crit dans une autre review, ce film vous rchauffe le coeur. C'est difficile d'expliquer les sentiments que l'on ressent mais en tout cas,  la fin du film on se surprend  sourir, on est heureux! yoopee!
0553801503|4.0|I can not tell you how many times during the course of reading this book I uttered the words, \\"Who the F@#%! is that?!?!\\", and I have read the entire series thus far. Seriously, how many names can you possibly throw at a reader?  George Martin has created a world that even he is getting lost in.  In his little explaination at the end, he says that this book was a bitch to write, well, at times it is a bitch to read too.   <br /> <br />With that said, it is beatifully written and the story is very good, though a little daunting to keep track of.  It is still the best fantasy series in print right now.  And no, I am not going to stop reading George Martin just because he wrote one \\"average\\" book, as some reviewers have said, come on, be serious.  I do hope that he cuts back on the number of people involved for \\"A Dance With Dragons\\" though, and spends a little more time truely advancing the story. <br /> <br />So, this is a good book and my least favorite in the series so far.  It is very complex, and engaging at the same time.  True fans of the series should read it so they can get ready for the next one.
B000008GHW|4.0|The Cry of Love was released after Jimi's death.  It shows a new direction for him. A direction I wish he could have persued further.  Some of my absolute favorite Hendrix songs appear on this CD  Among the songs are. Freedom which opens the album in style.  Drifting is a personal favorite of mine. Drifting is slowed down and in the the vain of Little Wing.  Easy Rider picks up the tempo.  Angel which is a ballad appears next and to me is one of his very finest moments on record.  I would buy the entire CD just for Angel  In From the Storm is another great rocker and shows Jimi in top form.  The Cry of Love was his last but not necesarily his least.  One of the top albums of Jimi's career and a must for any Hendrix fan.
B0002XNT0I|5.0|I saw Philadelphia for the 1st time two nights ago. Even though I enjoyed the movie (Hanks performance was excellent, the courtroom scenes were not too boring, and Antonio Banderas is always hot!)I have a question for reviewers who keep criticizing the film for the support that Beckett's (Tom Hanks) family shows. Why is that deemed unrealistic/too Hollywood? In my opinion that was one of the most beautiful aspects of the film. Believe it or not there are many families who are supportive and loving to their homosexual relatives. Often it is the cliche to make the homosexual person an outcast in the family or hated by his father etc. Since I am seeing this film 12yrs after the release I am used to seeing gays in cinema/television having troubled relationships w/their families if they have one at all. Also for any family to want to turn their back on their dying son is heartless, so it was refreshing to see a gay son so unconditionally loved by his family. <br />   A second question is for one reviewer who felt the ending was \\"greasy\\". Why did the ending not make sense? There was a scene w/Beckett and Miguel(Antonio Banderas) where they discuss planning a memorial service. Beckett obviously wanted a memorial service/life celebration not your standard funeral. So the ending made perfect sense to me. Also I do not think Washington's character(Miller) made a complete 360 on his views on gays. But it would be unrealistic for him to have that experience of defending and working w/Beckett and not come away with something.
0553573403|5.0|Forgive me for the cliche (I am a fantastic hypocrite), but there was no other way to prepare you for my review.<br /><br />Ahem. I love this entire series.  GRRM is fantastic.  Being unabashedly elitist right now, I'm going to say that people who cannot keep track of the names are stupid.  It is not the inability to keep track of the names is stupid, it is the fact that they complained about it at all.  This book and its sequels are meant to overwhelm you with the complexity of politics - thus named A GAME OF THRONES. Do you remember the name of every person who was introduced to you? NO! But hopefully, you can remember all the names of the important people in your life.  This ability is integral to the book, nothing more.  Though the boook/triology long, long, and very much longer, it took me as much time to read as I would indulge myself in a feast of ice cream.  In fact, I did both (eat and read) once I realized I would be reading the sequels (which are around the same length).<br /><br />Anyone who likes Tolkein would appreciate GRRM's work.  I've even heard that people like GRRM over Tolkein.  WHAT?! you might exclaim, but it is true.  At least, that is how I found the book in the first place.  Sadly enough, I have succumbed to the pleasures and displeasures, the happiness and the sadness, the kindness and cruelties, the etc. etc. of this book.  Oh, and anyone who likes Jin Yong would enjoy this book also.  Jin Yong is FANTASTICALLY complex and I see GRRM as his Western (and several generations youngeR) counterpart.  Fighting, love, hate, and politics.  What more do you want in a book?  If you want sex, it's there.  If you want something to make you cry (this only [hopefully] applies to girls), read this book.  If you want to hate powerful and manipulate women (too many of them in the world but only one in the book), read this book.  If you want to fall head over heels for the series, read to the very last drop.  I fell for the end; hook, reel, fry in the pan.  I usually hate when that happens, but it was worth it, over and over and over.<br /><br />All in all, read this book if you want to do something that is worth the time.  You have not read anything worth reading if you have not read this book.  The End.<br /><br />**Update: I laughed once I read this review that I wrote almost 8 years ago back when I was in high school and plainly, silly. I just want to add to my review to reflect how much I admire the author's work and waited (im)patiently for the rest to follow. I highly recommend reading this book, and I am ever so happy that it has found lots of success on the HBO series. It is a wonderful tale, and I have yet to read something again that delights me in the same way that only a well written and complex story can delight me. I'm very impressed by the Half Priced Books saleslady, whoever you are, that told me to read this series back when I was so young - you clearly were ahead of the game. I also remember advocating this book to my English class - and I now wonder if any of my classmates remember that... :)I usually hate when that happens, but it was worth it, over and over and over.<br /><br />All in all, read this book if you want to do something that is worth the time.

0307276902|5.0|After having read James Frey's debut novel, my answer is an unequivocal and resounding yes.  <br /> <br />I cannot remember a book evoking such a wide variety of emotions from me. Horror and shock at the damage and visceral accounting of the author's self-destruction; awe at Frey's shockingly honest and unfiltered description of himself and the path which led him to his crossroads; gut wrenching sadness at the shattered lives of the characters and pride and joy at the truth that free-will, friendship, integrity and love can liberate even the most self-destructive of people.  <br /> <br />Through \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" Frey allows us to see a human being at his absolute worst and 200 pages later at his best. Driving home the themes of self-accountability, integrity, honesty, friendship, love and free will through his journey, Frey brings the reader along with electric dialog, hearty laughter and tearful moments of both pain and joy.  <br /> <br />A writer for a generation... I hope so. <br />
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I knew nothing of the firefly series before my brother convinced me to contribute half the money to buy the dvd. I sat down, (skeptically, I admit) and looked at the episodes...one after the other, without a break. I was engrossed by this amazing world that Whedon so flawlessly created. Then i heard about the movie and obviously, made sure I saw it. Infinite wow.<br /><br />This is an excellent movie and that is an understatement. There is nothing that can encompass what Whedon has done with this series. The characters are flawless, in my opinion. Never have I seen a cast flow so smoothly together. It is a unique and beautiful thing. I spend my days now encouraging people to look at this series/movie. You'd be doing yourself a disservice if you didn't.
B0006L5RT2|1.0|I don't know how to express this eloquently because I've had a bottle of red, but I just saw James Blunt on Conan and he sucks.  That is the most contrived song I've ever heard and he's just a huge ponce.  He'll be gone in a matter of weeks, if there's any justice in this world.
0060931671|5.0|Gold. Gold. A hallmark of everything modern lit should be. This kind of writing is the heart and soul of our age. This is the stuff of canon, the kind of book and the kind of author they'll be studying 200 yrs from now in some 20th Century American Lit course, the professor will be saying \\"this is one of the best articulations of post WW2 cold war era american paranoia.\\" this novel is gold jerry, gold.
B000BMSTMS|5.0|KORN'S NEW ALBUM,\\"SEE YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE\\" IS A MIXTURE OF A LOT OF SONGS TO EXPECT FROM KORN AND A FEW THAT WEREN'T SO EXPECTED. BUT, WHO WANTS TO BUY AN ALBUM THAT IS EXPECTED TO SOUND A CERTAIN WAY. HITS LIKE, \\"HYPROCRITES\\" AND \\"LIAR\\" HAVE THE FEEL OF A GOOD OLD-FASHION OLD SCHOOL KORN SONG. KORN IS STILL A VERY HARD-CORE METAL BAND. I DEFINITELY SEE THEIR MUSIC EVOLVING. AND, IF YOU WERE LUCKY ENOUGH TO FETCH THE DELUXE EDITION OF THE ALBUM, \\"IT'S ME AGAIN\\" IS AN AWESOME BONUS! NOT TO MENTION THE REMIXES OF \\"TWISTED TRANSISTOR\\" AND VIDEOS ON THE SECOND DISC. I HAVE TO SAY MY FAVORITE SONGS ON THIS ALBUM ARE, \\"LOVE SONG\\" AND \\"10 OR A 2-WAY\\". HOWEVER, I AM A GIRL AND THESE ARE DEFINITE HARD-CORE LOVE SONGS, WHICH ARE MY FAVORITE! I'VE BEEN A VERY LOYAL KORN FAN FROM THE VERY BEGINING. I WAS SCARED TO DEATH THAT AFTER THE \\"GREATEST HITS\\" ALBUM DROPPED, THAT KORN WAS OVER. BUT, THEY HAVE SEIZED TO AMAZE ME ONCE AGAIN. \\"SEE YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE\\" IS A VERY HEAVY AND STRONG OPINIONATED ALBUM. VERY RAW BUT, WHAT ELSE HAVE WE COME TO EXPECT FROM A THE GOD FATHERS OF NU-METAL.
B000BMSTMS|5.0|This new Korn cd is awesome! I can't stop listening to it.. i definitely recommend this to all u out there. Its amazing! And some people didn't like the single \\"twisted transistor\\".. but don't worry.. not all the songs on the album sound like that.. each song has its own sound. If u don't have it yet.. what r u waiting for???
B00025ETIW|5.0|I love each song in this cd, it's great! ever since I purchased it I can't stop playing it. It's been so long since I listened to a cd I like as a whole and not just a few songs here and there. <br />Can't wait to listen their new stuff. Deserves all the five stars and even more.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|I have never been a slipknot fan and much less a fan of the current metal scene in general (which just keeps getting worse).  Im one of those stuck up and arrogant indie kids who thinks everything sucks except that which I have deemed otherwise and I say that this slipknot album rocks my face!  The complex rhythms of \\"the virus of life\\" highlight the band's flair for percussive intensity while \\"the nameless\\" manages to pull off being at once frightening playful and bizzare.  The creativity shown by this band on this album far exceeds that of any of the metal I have heard in years.
B000059QY3|5.0|A beautiful production for the most part, spirited conducting, no stupid German-style postmodern tricks in the direction...and Angela Gheorghiu who really embodies Violetta, she lives it, her intensity is truly extraordinary and her voice beautiful. Definitely a must have.
B000007XUQ|5.0|I still miss Karen Carpenter's seemingly effortless alto voice.  She had such a gorgeous lower register and nothing ever seemed strained.  Yet, if you sing along with her you will begin to realize how sophisticated the arrangements for her were and how much musicianship she had to pull them off so \\"casually\\".  This 2 disk set is a collection of the two Carpenter Christmas albums.  The Christmas Portrait from 1978 and the Old-Fashioned Christmas from 1984, the year after Karen's untimely passing.<br /><br />This collection is a must have and is about the best combination of the sacred and secular Christmas songs around.  More than that, it is especially nice to have on the sound system (we used to call them record players) and filling up your house with seasonal music and a great mood.  The first album relies more on Karen's voice and is as tightly arranged as a Christmas TV special.  While Richard had the very talented Peter Knight do most of the arrangements along with Billy May and his own work, Richard was the producer.  And my appreciation for his ability as a producer grows when I listen to these albums.<br /><br />The second album has a few numbers by Karen, much more of Richard's instrumental playing and a couple of his voice multi-tracked.  It is even more suited as casual listening, but it is the two of them together than offer such a rich contrast that makes for such a delightful and fun holiday music experience.<br /><br />When all is said and done, however, it is Karen's voice \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\", \\"The Christmas Song\\", \\"Merry Christmas, Darling\\", and \\"I'll Be Home for Christmas\\" that is so arresting and unforgettable.  On the second album, \\"I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day\\" is also just superb.  You may have different favorites, but for me she is at her very best on those songs.<br /><br />However, every track on both albums is worth listening to and there are few Christmas albums with such quality and fun.
B00005JO1P|2.0|Johnny Cash is the only country music performer I like.  I have five of his CDs.  Ever since I heard about WALK THE LINE, it was at the top of my Must Do list.  However, this movie seems like a deliberate attempt to assassinate his reputation.  It dwells on all of his negative aspects without truly letting his better qualities shine. <br /> <br />First off, there's the question of Joaquinn Phoenix.  For comparison's sake, let's realize that any actor taking on the role of a real and phenomenal man or woman is facing a daunting challenge.  We already have certain images burned into our brains.  We have seen, heard, and read about these people.  That being said, George C. Scott was Patton.  Denzel Washington was Malcolm X.  Jamie Foxx was Ray Charles.  Joaquin Phoenix was ... a pretty good imitation of Johnny Cash.  He never quite sounds like Cash, and he never quite establishes Cash's commanding presence. <br /> <br />Second, Cash was no angel, and this aspect of his character is in the movie.  However, it's most, if not all, of the movie.  His womanizing, his drinking, and his drug addiction are all there.  But where is his struggle to become a singer?  Where is his struggle to master music itself?  Judging by this movie, Cash pretty much was a master singer and musician from the first moment he attempted both. <br /> <br />Third and most importantly, when the time came to turn his life around, according to the movie, the decision to do so was made by other people.  The will to achieve his transformation also came from others.  He was just along for the ride, without any determination of his own. <br /> <br />On the positive side, Reese Witherspoon becomes June Carter.  Also, unlike RAY, we see the negative affects on others from Cash's self-destructive behavior.  The problem is that by the end of the movie, Cash has been portrayed as a man of unsubstantial courage, unsubstantial will, unsubstantial intellect, and unsubstantial compassion.  He's little more than anArkansas hick with money. <br /> <br />I have no doubts that Joaquin Phoenix will win an award for his performance, and the film itself will win awards, because that's the kind of thing Hollywood likes:  People who can't do anything for themselves and who must let others straighten them out.  Unfortunately, there's a depth to Cash's music that is not attainable by the person portrayed in this film.
B00080ZG1A|5.0|There is nothing wrong with your tv set. The first minutes of this film is shown in two color technicolor process. This process was used in the 1920's and 1930's when some black & white films were experimenting with adding color to film. <br />  When the film gets to the scene with Alec Baldwin and the Katharine Hepburn estate scenes, you will notice the film is now a more normal color. <br />  I am glad that Leonardo Dicaprio played the role as \\"Howard Hughes\\" and not some other \\"risky business\\" of an actor. <br />  Leonardo DiCaprio should have won the Academy Award for Outstanding Actor in 2005, but the Academy chose someone else instead. <br />  DiCaprio made you believe that he was \\"Howard Hughes\\" and the scenes of madness shows you how talented this actor is. <br />  What the film does not cover is the relationship between Jane Russell and Howard and when Howard isolated himself in a Las Vegas hotel he had bought.  He had become a recluse dependant on Valium and codine, dropped to 100 pounds to his death. <br />  Howard Hughes may have had a bad chilhood and was stubborn as an adult, but he was exactly right about the future. He opened the door for the invention of helicopters and satellites. <br />  Another film about Howard Hughes: <br />  THE AMAZING HOWARD HUGHES (1977-tv) starring Tommy Lee Jones.
1573223026|1.0|We just read this for a book club, and the good thing about it is that it did provoke opinions.  A few people liked it.  Half didn't finish.  Many didn't even show up.   <br /> <br />Personally, I found the characters shallow and underdeveloped, the writing weak and the story uncompelling.  I couldn't get beyond page 100, so perhaps I should not be writing this review. <br /> <br />One interesting note is that the younger members of our book club, those in their 20's, seemed to like it more than those of us over 30. Could be a generational thing.
B00013F38K|3.0|Like the previous reviewer I have a problem with the episodes having been shortened a few minutes to make room for more commercials, which cuts into the story and makes it choppier. And the screen also seems to have been cropped too. But overall, I guess it's better to have them in this format and versions than not at all. But that's why the three star rating.<br /><br />A brief comment on the martial arts, since I am a teacher of kung fu and also karate. A judo instructor, oddly enough, was the first expert engaged to advise on the martial arts for the show. At some point, someone apparently said shouldn't we get a kung fu expert since that's what the show is about? And so they retained Los Angeles sifu Kam Yuen, a master of the very interesting tai mantis style of kung fu, which is an offshoot of the original northern praying mantis style and considered a very sophisticated system.<br /><br />There are actually dozens of different praying mantis styles at this point, including six harmonies mantis, plum flower mantis, shiny board mantis, 7 star praying mantis, and southern mantis, although the latter probably isn't a true praying mantis sytem.<br /><br />So it was interesting that a master of one of the rarer kung fu styles in this country was chosen, rather than something more common such as Wing Chun, Hung Gar, Choy Li Fut, or 7 Star Praying mantis, all of which are more common styles. But whatever style was chosen, the show introduced millions of people to kung fu in a way that was technically accurate and faithful to the original style.
B00005JO04|4.0|Similar to \\"Traffic\\" this motion picture \\"Syriana\\" is composed of several stories about the lives and destinies of individuals under one big umbrella. While in \\"Traffic\\" most of the various individuals from the different stories never meet, in \\"Syriana\\" it all comes together and it is interwoven.  The Arab world behind the scenes is very well captured in this film and it certainly was one of George Clooney's best roles ever. The good part was that finally George wasn't running around like a $20+ million actor, instead he plays a somewhat likeable CIA agent with the \\"usual\\" \\"modern\\" dysfunctional family-type of thing.  At times the storyline seems to touch only the surface of the issues without digging deeper, but then it's a motion picture and not a documentary. I don't know what some people meant with the liberal left agenda being promoted in this film ... I don't think it had much to do with it other than there's a touch of \\"conspiracy\\" theory packed into this flick, but otherwise it  showed quite a bit of the reality of how international business is conducted even in our days.  Matt Damon plays his part well too and of course it's not a Bourne Identity/Supremacy performance because his role is minor. The film has been well executed and you've got to be prepared to think watching this film ... so it's not some relaxing flick for a cozy Saturday afternoon. In the end there are some loose ends, but that's why we have an imagination to figure out such things by ourselves. It's well worth watching this film and the filmmaker is taking us on a journey around the globe introducing us to a world most folks won't be familiar with -- it's very interesting, although it has a rather sad undertone.  While \\"Syriana\\" shows us the big Oil biz, I would say that Alec Donzi's excellent thriller \\"The Consultant\\" (only a book so far) shows us in similar fashion the big Nuke biz around the world -- and I hope that they'll make a movie of Alec Donzi's \\"Consultant\\" too ... this would bereally great.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|<br />\\"You know what the defenition of a hero is?  Somebody who gets other people killed...\\" <br /> <br />The characters of firefly are easy to love, not because they are good guys, but because they are flawed...because they are tainted.  Before this movie, none of them had trancended to the level of hero within an episode(exception - mal//Zoe at the beginning of the pilot, before their cause died).   <br /> <br />They've played the noble villains enough times, true.  They've given back stolen goods that they realized were in dire need. They've rescued each other time and time again, out of love and loyalty.  They even protected a whore with a heart of gold, but more out of personal admiration and affinity than for any cause.   <br /> <br />This movie throws them in the center of something too big for themselves, but in that center they find a cause so worth fighting for, they willingly put themselves and their loved ones on the line for it. It's for that bravery, that selflessness, that they all transcend into heroes. Of course, such a journey is bittersweet.  The price is high.  Karma has no place in this universe.  thankfully, Serenity does.
B00092ZL80|5.0|First, any fan of either band is most likely a fan of the other.  I have seen and heard each band in every incarnation and have loved all of them.  The core players are there but the young new players are exceptional in this incarnation of each band.  The energy is there and the \\"fun\\" that is music just needs to be experienced. <br /> <br />The performance of each individual band is immpeccable as one would expect.  The majic happens when the two bands take the stage together and perform each other's compositions together.  The energy, fun, snd performance are better than anything I have seen in a long long time.  They are really enjoying themselves and it shows in the performance. <br /> <br />Also, the recording, both video and audio, are excellent.  This is really one very well done concert DVD that I am sure will become a classic performance.  I only wish I was there in person to witness such an amazing feat. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.  If you do not see this, you are missing a part of history.
B000BVEKO0|5.0|Korn's new album \\"See You On the Other Side\\" is their best to date.  Korn has not skipped a beat despite change record labels and losing a guitarist.  They have managed to rise from the ashes with a new Korn sound.  Every song on the album is different from the last.  The album features the new single \\"Twisted Transistor,\\" plus 13 other headbangers.  My favorite song is \\"Throw Me Away\\" because it has a melodic creepiness to it.  I also love \\"Coming Undone.\\"  I would strongly recommend getting the deluxe edition because you get 3 bonus tracks, 2 remixes of \\"Twisted Transistor,\\" and 2 videos of the band playing live, plus a one year free membership to the new Korn fanclub, BSC!  EVERYONE MUST BUY THIS ALBUM!!
B000AP04L0|5.0|I have never seen this movie in the theaters.  Neither has anyone else, as far as I know. <br /> <br />My first viewing of this film came in early 2002.  I was fed up with my job, and my employer (a large high-tech firm whose name I will not mention here) was announcing upcoming layoffs.  I'd heard about Office Space from several friends of mine, and so I finally decided to rent it.  By the time I returned it, I had watched it eight times. <br /> <br />I've now seen it a total of twelve times, and it still makes me laugh.  There is something in this movie for anyone who's endured a job in corporate America.  I could strongly identify with Peter, the main character of the film, who is apparently trying to find himself.  But really every character in this movie is worth remembering. <br /> <br />I got the Special Edition with Flair as a recent Netflix rental.  While I don't think the deleted scenes would have really added to the movie, there are a couple good ones, and the documentary about the making of the film is worth seeing. <br /> <br />Not sure I'll ever actually buy this, but I will definitely rent it any time I'm feeling disgusted with work!
B00006I53S|4.0|As most people have stated this is a really nice lens for both full-frame/film and 1.6x cropped digitals.  I really like the range on my digital; 45-216mm equiv., but I have to keep the kit lens around when I need wide-angle.  The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because I think the price is a little high for a maximum aperture of f/5.6 at the tele end; f/4.0 would have been nice. <br /> <br />IS works really well, but don't fool yourself into thinking that just because you have IS that you can take low-light pictures without a flash.  As a general rule you shouldn't hand-hold a camera for an exposure longer then the inverse of your effective focal length (meaning that if you are zoomed to 60mm then the shutter should be no slower then 1/100 on a 1.6x cropped body).  IS on this lens lets you reduce that by about 2 stops (some say 3, but I'm not sure I agree); so in the example above you could shoot as slow as 1/30.  This is very helpful, but still not enough light for indoor with no flash. <br /> <br />I use this lens with my SpeedLight 430EX, which seems to give me about a 100 foot shooting range in very dimly lit rooms at 100 ISO.  I really don't have to worry about the shutter speed much. With the flash my Digital Rebel seems to prefer 1/60; which thanks to IS, is just fast enough for the effective maximum focal length of 216mm. <br />
0441172717|5.0|There are many reviews here that say a lot of the things about how I feel about this book. So there's little to add, read some of the reviews, but I must warn you they might be a bit of a spoiler if you want to be totally surprised at what the DUNE epic has to unfold.  <br /> <br />If you like to read a book that makes you think a lot yet at the same time keeps you intrigued, thrilled gripping the edge of the seat almost like a wild roller coaster, this book is fantastic. This is my 3rd time reading it, and I'm unfolding plots and mysteries I did not notice before.  <br /> <br />I've read many works of fiction and few authors can do what Frank Herbert has done. He has intricately created so many layers of stories in a different universe that is so consistent, it almost feels like you're reading history mixed with scientific exposition. <br /> <br />I've given this book to several people as gifts hoping they'd enjoy it as much as I did. For informational purposes I'm not a hardcose scifi fan, I've read books by or like LOTR, HMS Ulysses, Jeffrey Archer, John Grisham, Agathe Christie, Oscar Wilde, Dick Francis, Alistair Maclean and many more, but Frank Herbert is on a different level.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I picked this movie up after seeing the preview for it on television, not sure of what I got myself into. For the average Joe, it starts out rather slow. But if you just give it some time, you will be pleasantly surprised about this movie that has become my favorite out there. I could not stop laughing at the jokes that were subtle and the visual \\"moves\\". I think that anybody who hasn't been high on the social ladder or always roots for the underdog will find enjoyment from this movie. It's a movie that I ended up buying and pick up when I want a good laugh and feel good movie. I can watch it over and over and not get tired of it.
B0006213H6|5.0|As a huge fan of 1960s-1970s European psychedelic and progressive rock, \\"Berlin School\\" electronica, and American minimalism, I was delighted with this 1997 debut from Icelanders Sigur Ros.  Stylistically, this album fuses elements of electronica, minimalism, the European avant-garde, and ambient styles (especially Brian Eno) with rock, and exhibits a level of studio wizardry that is vaguely reminiscent of psychedelic rock groups such as Pink Floyd during the 1967-1969 period.<br /><br />The overall mood of Von is windswept and grey, haunting, and at times, pretty creepy.  A good example of the creepiness is provided by the heavily echoed \\"screams from outer space\\" on the 9'46\\" opening track (Sigur Ros), briefly at the end of Hun Jord, and on Syndir Guos.  Interestingly, those screams made the hairs stand on the back of my neck just as readily as the bloodcurdling screams on \\"Careful with that Axe Eugene\\" (Pink Floyd, 1968). There are gloomy, brooding vocal parts scattered throughout the recording, although they do not comprise a large part of the compositions.  Interestingly, the lyrics were written in a fabricated language called \\"Hopelandic\\" - the French band Magma (chamber progressive) did something similar in the early-mid 1970s in a language called \\"Kobaian\\".<br /><br />It is worth noting that the heavy opening of Hun Jord (complete with distorted guitar played at a crushing volume), the beautifully sad Myrkur, the title track Von, and Syndir Guos, in addition to the last few minutes of the final track Aukrym (albeit with backwards recorded parts) are the only pieces that resemble \\"songs\\", and for the most part, the pieces are instrumental and very lengthy.  Although there are breaks here and there, musical themes are restated at various points throughout the album, creating a single larger work.<br /><br />Instrumentation is somewhat sparse, and electronic experimentation conducted primarily on synthesizers (possibly guitar synthesizers as well) dominate the aural landscape.  Brief passages of electric guitar (heavily distorted in addition to clean tones) and acoustic guitar are present during the conventional \\"songs\\", in addition to bass guitar, drums, and very interesting percussion parts.<br /><br />In contrast to a lot of ambient recordings, which exhibit only extremely subtle permutations in musical themes within a given piece, Von is sprinkled with variations in tone and timbre, and displays use of both experimental and found sounds.  This variability, coupled with the combination of vocal and experimental passages, in addition to the stark dynamic contrasts between the spacier passages and the heavy, \\"rocking\\" sections makes Von a very interesting recording.<br /><br />This debut album is recommended to those people that don't mind experimental approaches to rock music and are not put off by the absence of traditional song structure.  In fact, I highly recommend this album to fellow progheads that are desperately looking for excellent music in the current prog scene.<br /><br />Further discussion of the band is provided on the Gibraltar Encyclopedia of Progressive Rock website - unfortunately it has not been updated.ief passages of electric guitar (heavily distorted in addition to clean tones) and acoustic guitar are present during the conventional \\"songs\\", in addition to bass guitar, drums, and very interesting percussion parts.

B000BMSTMS|5.0|This album is amazing. They really experimented with with differant sounds and sound programs. For a great example. Listen to LOVE SONG (Track 7). And, keep in mind. They no longer have their other guitar player (Brian \\"Head\\" Welch). And believe. This album is worth buying. Especially the limited Edition version. That comes with a bonus disc and a FREE 1 Year membership to their new fan club. To me, this is KoRn's most creative album yet.
B000BKJ78U|1.0|I just picked up this DVD at a store.  The back of the box indicated the set had \\"the 3 classic star wars films digitally remastered and restored.\\"  There was NO mention that it also included the extra scenes inserted by Lucas that have made these DVDs so hated by the fans of the ORIGINAL triology.<br /><br />So if you're like me and you've been waiting for Lucas to re-release the original triology, this isn't it.
B00005JO04|3.0|If you have read Kenneth Pollack's penetrating book about the current political malaise in Iran, \\"The Persian Puzzle: The Conflict Between Iran and America\\", you will have some idea of what writer-director Stephen Gaghan is attempting to portray in this tightly paced, atmospheric but ultimately confusing thriller. The movie's social commitment is impressive, but the narrative is so fragmented and some actions so vaguely motivated that the result is unfortunately something of a muddle for much of its 126-minute running time. By traipsing the globe in brief scenes one after the other, Gaghan attempts to peel the layers off the complex and often corrupt relationships among American oil companies, intelligence agencies, the government and the ruling class of the oil-rich Persian Gulf. With its shaky hand-held camerawork and lightning-quick pacing, the movie bears a striking similarity to Stephen Soderbergh's version of \\"Traffic\\" (he is an executive producer here) but not in terms of its dramatic resonance.<br /><br />There are at least four separate stories that intertwine through the various locales, most intriguingly in a fictional Arab country where one of two sons is about to become the ruling emir. Which one is selected has direct bearing on a high-profile merger between two oil companies in Texas. There is another subplot focused on a Pakistani oil worker whose frustrations with the oil companies lead him toward drastic measures. None of these strands are very clear at the outset, nor how they are interrelated. I kept hoping there would be a more lucid portrayal of the volatile Middle East situation amid the military forces and oil companies. Instead, like what Fernando Meirelles does with \\"The Constant Gardener\\", which has a similar disregard for the major pharmaceutical companies in Africa, Gaghan seems to be going for a more visceral tone to drive his story, and on that level, it works.<br /><br />What also works is the stellar acting even if the characters are so elliptical in motivation that you need a playbook to keep up with their stories. The three leads are quite effective. As Bob Barnes, a rogue CIA operative respected for his experience but alienated by his entrepreneurial approach to his work, George Clooney appears to be evolving nicely into character roles that stretch his skills. Through soulful gazes and some brutalizing scenes of torture, he is able to convey his character's conscience with a minimum of fuss. Matt Damon is ideally cast as Bryan Woodman, a derivatives trader and global finance expert who provides guidance to the \\"good\\" son, a progressive Arab prince who really wants to restructure his country's economy for lasting benefit to its citizenry. Jeffrey Wright continues to impress as Bennett Holiday, an ambitious Washington lawyer ordered by his boss to not only vet the oil merger but rubber stamp it. Intriguingly, all three characters have been given more personal profiles - Barnes has a college-age son with whom he feels estranged, Woodman goes through the loss of a child, and Holiday has a resentful alcoholic father - but none of these dimensions are explored with any depth.<br /><br />Gaghan has certainly assembled an extensive cast, and there are solid contributions from Alexander Siddig as the reform-minded Prince Nasir Al-Subaai, Chris Cooper as one of the oil company CEOs, Christopher Plummer as Holiday's corrupt boss, Jayne Atkinson as the poker-faced CIA division chief, and Amanda Peet as Woodman's inconsolable wife. In even smaller roles are stalwarts such as William Hurt, David Clennon and an emphatic Tim Blake Nelson. Despite the film's intentions and often powerful execution, I just wish the film was far less convoluted and the storyline more streamlined within its framework. By the way, one of many unexplained details is the title, Syriana, which is a Washington insider term referring to the notion that the US can recast developing nations in our own image.in motivation that you need a playbook to keep up with their stories.

B00005JO04|4.0|Stephen Gaghan has undertaken a difficult task in trying to tell the tale of the International Oil trade.  It is a tale spanning continents, with players in and out of business and government.  It is the nexus for corruption and terrorism and it underlies most everything in our daily lives.  It is a story too big for one picture, and this picture can't tell it all.  But it is an admirable and intriguing effort.  And it isn't a pretty picture.    As all will point out, this is a movie told in a complex and convoluted narrative.  It is not a feel good, what-me-worry entertainment.  You stand warned.  But for the discerning and patient viewer, this dark tale's various strands will all weave together to a comprehensible, albeit inconclusive resolution.  Along the way, dirty deeds are done and good soldiers are sold out.  As ever.    Big Oil means Big Business, Big Money, Big Government, Big Intrigue.  Any commodity generating this kind of wealth means that every sort of corruption and greed and treachery can be found in and around it and trailing in its wake.  Like the drug trade (Gaghan's last subject in Traffic), there is so much money floating around that it inevitably will besmirch the Hallowed Halls of Power in DC, Corporate Boardrooms, and sanctified Law firms.  And this is a commodity the world runs on.    So has Gaghan told us the truth?  Much of it, I'm sure, is spot on. But it is fragments of observation, with Gaghan's overall view muddled. I was a little disappointed in a bit too much emphasis on America as villain.  To paraphrase my favorite line about the corruptions we all face in the real world (from Chinatown)\\"we swim in the same waters as everyone else\\".  Gaghan didn't seem to see realize his film comes off this way when I saw him on Charlie Rose.  He stated that he thought American companies were a might cleaner in their practices than some of the European and Asian companies. Not to mention all the countries concerned. In short, we didn't invent ruthless.    I would recommend you set aside your political biases and enjoy a film that takes us into worlds most of us will never see, and probably would just as soon not know about.  The truth of what this commodity, this driving force, has meant to our lives was brought shockingly home to us all a few years ago.  It is the driving force behind our politics and policies today. It finances our enemies. Any film that sheds any light on this subject should be welcome.
B0002WYS6S|5.0|This is an awesome concert DVD, there are no praises I can offer that haven't already been made, but I do have one little comment to make about the production... <br />Perhaps it is just on the surround systems and DVD players that I am using (I hope so), but I notice quite a bit of compression in terms of the audio. E.g., the guitar opening of a song, \\"Endless Sacrifie\\" for example, is nice and loud, but when the rest of the band kicks in the overall sound gets softer, which is quite disappointing because I am expecting the opposite: that the overall sound should get louder. <br />Has anyone else noticed this on their DVD? Or is this happening because of some setting on my DVD player or the DVD itself? Basically, is the compression on my DVD a default that I should just trade in for a new one, or do I need to change a setting on my player? <br />thanks
B00000260F|4.0|This CD has some classically excellent Beck. Also, the music in this CD is typical of the 80s disco type music. Rod Stewart does a fantastic People Get Ready. And Beck has some awesome guitar work here in Back On The Streets.
B00005JNZJ|2.0|The movie has only one thing going for it. The costumes and the cinematography. Other than that, the movie is very lame. All the good scenes were shown in the movie trailer/teaser. So u're not missing anything. Most of the action/stunt scenes happened in microseconds so u couldn't even enjoy the action scenes (not to say they were good to begin with) cuz they all happened so fast. Stupid gymnastic and martial arts crap. Aeon Flux is an ordinarly human being but she has all these superpowers like flying around, martial arts, and shootings guns. I don't get it. This movie is stupid just like Charlie's Angels and Stealth. And razor blade grass and needle shooting fruit trees. Oh And Charlize gives corny one-liners just like Lara Croft in Tomb Raider.
0345440900|5.0|First off, I would say that every child is different, therefore every parent will need to find what works for their child. <br /> <br />I did not read the section on breastfeeding so I cannot comment on that.   However, I did find her suggestions extremely helpful on teaching your child to go to sleep on his own.     <br /> <br />From other's comments, I did not interpret her suggestions as to allowing a baby to cry it out.   In fact, she specifically mentioned that to do so was cruel.    Her theory is to slowly wean the child from sleep crutches until the child can fall asleep on their own. <br /> <br />I have been trying this with my now four month old son for the past 3 weeks and there is now a remarkable difference in our bedtime routine.   We used to spend 1 hour to 1.5 hours of me holding him, swaying, swaddling, bouncing while he cried himself to sleep.    I one-by-one stopped doing one of the above until he became used to not having it.   Within a week he was down to crying for only 20 minutes.    I now just hold and rub his back for a while to let him know it is time to wind down while I tell him what we are doing (as the book suggests).   He now rarely cries at all and this week he is starting to fall asleep on his own when I put him in his crib while he is still awake. <br /> <br />I tell him that I will stay with him until he falls asleep and lo and behold, he just seems to be more peaceful. <br /> <br />During this transition/training time, if he did ever start to cry after putting him down, I would always pick him up to let him know that I am there.   I never had to do this over and over.   He just seemed to be okay and then would go to sleep when I would put him back down. <br />
B00001ZWTT|3.0|I wonder if there's anyone out there who sometimes sees films that everyone berates, simply because you want to see for yourself whether or not they're right?  This was what drew me to Wild Wild West.  That and a desire to grasp how this state of affairs came to be. <br /> <br />This was a big budget summer movie starring Will Smith and Kevin Kline as the heros, directed by the man who cast Smith so well in Men In Black.  It was an action comedy with two heroes trying to stop a megalomaniac tear their country apart while making the Old West look like the future.  How could it fail? <br /> <br />My opinion is, it didn't have to.  Wild Wild West is overall not an especially good film.  But unlike some I've seen, I believe it could easily have been much better. <br /> <br />Who could fail to be impressed by seeing Smith ride into Washington past a Capitol Building still being constructed?  And the vehicles and gadgetry in the film are awesome - the look of Jules Verne with the feel of James Bond.  I just love it when futuristic technology gets dressed up as it might have looked 100 years ago.   <br /> <br />Furthermore, Smith and Kline's characters (Captain James West and Agent Artemis Gordon respectively), although not expertly developed, have interesting parallels with one another.  Both have different approaches to their highly dangerous and treacherous job as government agents, yet at heart they are very similar.  Both are brave, cunning and capable, yet while Gordon relies on disguise and technical ingenuity, West is much more a soldier who relies most of all on his gun. <br /> <br />There's a classic \\"buddy\\" narrative between these two, as well as a \\"mutual love interest\\" narrative when the lovely Selma Hayek steps in.  Smith is the same wise-cracking hero he played so well in Independence Day and Men In Black.  Just like in Fierce Creatures, Kline plays two roles, also taking on the role of then President Ulysees S Grant.  Kline expertly makes one virtually indistinguishable from the other.  There's one scene where this talent takes on a life of its own, when Artemis Gordon disguises himself as the President.  Can YOU tell which is which? <br /> <br />It's the beginning that unltimately lets Wild Wild West down.  The action hots up as the film wears on, but due to a rather lukewarm offset I lose my initial interest by this point and only partly get it back by the end.  There's also Kenneth Brannagh, rather miscast and scarcely believable as evil genius and staunch Confederate Dr Arliss Loveless, who's survived the American Civil War despite having to be strapped to a steam-powered life-support machine cum wheelchair!  Oh well, at least his heart seems to be in it. <br /> <br />If you only go in for quality, highly recommended movies, leave Wild Wild West alone.  But those of you who look for the best in everything, this is your film.

B0006L16N8|5.0|Alrite i have read a couple reviews of this CD and would just like to enter my input. I am not the typical person who you would imagine to like Coldplay. But none the less I Love Coldplay. Now all i can say about Coldplay is that I can relate the lyrics to my everyday life and that is what i love about Coldplay. Now I cant say I love this CD so much now go buy it for yourself, what i can say though is that I like the CD for my own reasons, and i advise you to listen to the CD and if it is to you liking purchase it.
B000002KYR|5.0|This has to be one of the best ZZ Top albums of all times. It is good hard driving rock all through with those three Texas dudes that never fail to impress.
B000BGH22W|3.0|A big change from the previous three scores, The Goblet of Fire is a dark and heavy score with little of the whimsy and fun we've come to expect.  That's not necessarily a bad thing as this is a much darker story than what has come before.  It's just too bad that this score doesn't leave much of an impact.  After listening to it four times through, I still have a hard time recalling any of the new themes.  It works well enough in the film, but it's just not that fun to listen to on its own.<br /><br />The last three songs are preformed by the Weird Sisters.  They are loud rockers with lots of screaming and goofy lyrics (Runnin' like a hairy troll, learnin to rock and roll).  Frankly, I plan to never listen to them again.
B00000IPAX|5.0|This is one of those rare albums where I actually like every track on the CD. <br /> <br />This CD is great, and includes many radio hits that at one time or another you've most likely heard, such as \\"All The Small Things\\", \\"Adams Song\\", and \\"What's My Age Again?\\" <br /> <br />Although a bit of it is immature, the album does come out to be really great. <br /> <br />In my opinion, the best songs are Dumpweed, Don't Leave Me, Aliens Exist, What's My Age Again, and Adams Song.

B0009IW88A|4.0|The first time I saw Batman Begins, I thought the music was cool and well done. The second time, I had to have it. Especially for the amount of writing Zimmer does for Hollywood, he produced an interesting, emotional, evocative acore that reaches in and grabs you. There are similarities to Gladiator and his other work, but it is perfectly suited for the excellent movie. This is the first Batman movie that comes close to being plausible; the emotional warfare that is its real theme is completely and brilliantly evoked by this soundtrack.
B000BKJ78U|2.0|A lot of people are bashing Lucas for this mess, and I happen to agree with a lot of the points that they raise.  On the other hand, I also understand that Lucas, the artist of these films, wants to retouch his work to make it more to his liking.  He has a right to do that, and I will never deny him that. <br /> <br />What I don't understand here is that he has a lot of people who are and were willing to give his re-realized versions a chance.  Hell, in 1997 I was as extatic as the next guy to be able to see the first film on the big screen, seeing as how I was born in 1978, a year after the initial release.  With all of the added effects, I found that, although the experience of seeing the film at the theatre was great, the magic was gone....rather it was kinda' handed to me.  What I mean by this is, with the original Theatrical version of the Trilogy, there was a fanciful air about it.  The effects weren't perfect, but this allowed a generation of fans to imagine and suspend disbelief, because they believed so wholeheartedly in these films and the originality of the presentation.  We invented worlds within ourselves to explain all of the backstory and all of the creatures that weren't there. <br /> <br />Come 1997, we were given the creatures that weren't there.  Handed to us on a silver platter (or, in this case silver screen).  I don't know about many of you, but the creatures that I was handed were a long way from what I had imagined.  Still, however, like I said earlier, it is his right to retouch his work...he is the artist. <br /> <br />However, my argument is this...Although he has the right to touch the films and present them in a new way, we as fans are the ones who gave him that chance to retouch the films.  These films could have been like an old painting sitting in an attic collecting dust...but a generation of crazed fans wouldn't have it that way.  We loved it...and we wanted more, but were happy with what we had.  That same generation longs for theability to view the painting as it once was.  Like going to a store and buying a print of a painting, I long to be able to go to the store and buy a copy of the artwork that I fell in love with....or at least to be able to purchase a set that has both realizations included so you can view what you prefer. <br /> <br />A few years back when Terminator 2 came out on Laserdisc, there was a Special edition of the film released.  This special edition allowed you to view the original film or the extended cut.  One may prefer one over the other, but you had the choice to view your prefered version.  We Star Wars fans have not been given that choice.  We who are so willing to give our hard earned money to the man who helped a generation imagine something great...to live a story that never actually happened, but was so believeable that it could have happened.  We are still that willing...I know I am.  Even if he repeackaged his new realization, which I already own, with the original cuts of the films, I would purchase them in a heartbeat.   <br /> <br />Instead, what we get here is a lame attempt to swindle the very people who made the swindling possible.  George, this is a travesty...an outrage, and I for one am not going to stand for it.  I will not purchase this mess and neither should anyone else.  We have given you every chance in the world...with those rediculous prequels and the destruction of our beloved childhood memories...why would you not give us the chance...the chance to decide for ourselves which is the better version.  I don't think any of us would deny you (whether we can or can't) the right to \\"update\\" your work...we wouldn't want to.  Just give us a chance...a chance that our many millions of combined dollars, in my opinion, has earned us.
B000BVD460|4.0|First of all let me state. I am a big Eminem fan, I've heard all his albums, all of D12s albums, and almost every song he's featured in.    Now lets get into his first greatest hits album. This album contains almost all his radio hits, his biggest Without Me, My Name Is, The Real Slim Shady ect... but what dissapoints me most about this album is that it doesn't have some of his best songs. Criminal, Role Model, Just Don't Give A F*ck, Rock Bottom, (just to mention a few) are all absent here, and while some of these were not played on the radio they should have been on this album. Especially when songs like \\"Just Lose It\\" and \\"Mockingbird\\" make the cut.    My next dissapointment is the new songs. When I heard Em was doing 3 new ones I was really expecting something. I heard When I'm Gone three weaks ago and loved it, and was exited about what the other two were. When I heard them I was amazed at how bad they were.  \\"Fack\\" ranks among his worst songs ever and \\"Shake That\\" is aweful. If your going to get Nate Dogg for a track make it a good one, like the previous Nate Dogg tracks (B*tch Please II, Till I Collaspe). The live version of Stan is also not so good, the quality is very bad.    Overall it has some of his best songs but lacks others. I don't reccomend buying if you have all his others, just go buy \\"When I'm Gone\\" individually instead of buying this whole album for that one song.
0385504209|1.0|Everything that Dan Brown covers in his book, The Da Vinci Code, was done in far better depth nearly 20 years ago by Umberto Eco in a book titled Foucault's Pendulum.  Except for the fact that Dan Brown chose to harp endlessly on the Mary Magdalene theory.  Umberto Eco, wisely, did little more that mention this concept in his book, because he knew that the Mary Magdalene arguement is implosive - or it destroys itself.  Ask your self this:  in keeping with Dan Brown's theory, Christ was not divine, the holy grail is in fact Mary Magdalene and their progeny.  Okay fine, but if this is the case, and Christ wasn't divine, then why should any of us care who he was??  Better yet, why would we care about Mary Magdalene or her children.  See the problem?  I am not trying to start a theological debate here, I am simply taking the story that Dan Brown wrote.  His argument does not make sense.  If you are intersted in GOOD conspiracy theories, then read Umberto Eco's book.  Unlike Brown, Eco is a professor of history, philosophy, and Semiotics.  He truly knows the information behind the groups that he mentions, and he dosen't waste his time on bogus ideas.  Instead, Foucault's Pendulum analyzes the origins of the Templar, Freemasons, Cabal, and the occult, into a far more interesting story.  The only problem here is that Eco does not write in the simplified manner that Dan Brown does.  You will likely find your self looking up names, words, and references, in order to grasp the intensity of the story - at least, I know I did.  So, if you want a really good story about secret societies and underground movements, then don't waste your time on the juvenile arguments of the Da Vinci code.  Read something better.
B00005JGAB|5.0|This is a great album, its The Ramones debut, made on a extreamly low budget. The album clocks around at only 20 minutes, and it represents punk rock more than any other album at least until Never Mind The Bollocks, Heres The Sex Pistols. The songs are all great, mindless fun, everything from the famous Blitskrieg Bop to the cult favorite Judy Is A Punk to other greats like Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue, Havana Afair and Chainsaw. All great songs with the tight yet simple rhythm structures that The band became so well known for. Its sad that people can be so close minded against more simple forms of music, sure complexity is nice, im a big progressive rock fan myself, but what makes The Ramones great is the genious of their simplicity...I definitely recomend this album.
0380789019|3.0|This is my first Gaiman book and I didn't really know what I was getting into. I've seen the Sandman comics, but I'm pretty sure I never read one. To sum up the book \\"Neverwhere\\" in one word, I'd use \\"bizzare\\".  It feels a little bit like a transcript of a role playing game in Vampire or some other gothic fantasy system.  The characters are on a quest.  'Richard' is the newbie to the group who mostly follows along to be the dazed point-of-view guy.  Gaiman makes a /great/ game master with vivid environment descriptions, but the characters are a little less fleshed out... I didn't feel attached to any of them particularly, and I wanted very much to admire the Lady Door but just couldn't.  Gaiman could also be excellent at simply stringing together those vivid dreams/nightmares that you have at the edge of wake and sleep.  An interesting read, but not really my personally favorite cup of tea.
B0006Q1ULQ|2.0|Though I was intrigued by the novel after reading Eco's The Name of the Rose, I found the book unbearably dull. It took me about six months to finish it, just because I kept picking up other more interesting books to read. I eventually suffered through it. I have seen this book numerous times on bargains shelves in various stores, and I always have to fight the urge to complain to management about having the nerve to sell such a laborious read. <br />The Name of the Rose receives high marks from me. Baudolino -- not so much.
B000000OPZ|5.0|It's 1987 and Whitesnake throws in guitarist John Sykes. He was from the band Thin Lizzy. \\"The Boys Are Back In Town\\" was one of Thin Lizzy's biggest hits. If you noticed, Thin Lizzy didn't have alot of huge guitar solos with John Sykes. So, how will he fit into Whitesnake then? In the song \\"Straight To The Heart\\" a very fast guitar solo is present, and it shocked me. This song mos def rubbed off me alot, because of the guitar solo. It's so incredibly fast. I'm sure this also shocked Whitesnake lovers. Also, a new version of \\"Here I Go Again\\" came out. It wasn't so \\"churchy\\" as some of my friends say. This album has everything, and after this album was thrown out there, John Sykes left the band.<br /><br />So, 1989 comes around, just about to crack into 1990. Whitesnake has a crazy guitarist named Steve Vai. He was in David Lee Roth's band, and was taught guitar by Joe Satriani who are 4 years apart. Steve Vai mos def does a great job.<br /><br />Basically, Whitesnake's self-titled debut was a huge hit, just like Boston's self-titled debut. But, it wasn't a debut. So, you need to go out and get it if you love classic rock/hair metal. What a surprise John Sykes was.
B00005JO04|3.0|This is the most complex film that I have seen in a while. It's the type of film that I would have to watch more than once to appreciate, as I didn't get a sense of who all the characters were and what agendas they had. <br /> <br />Oil rich Gulf country's apparent next leader, a prince, decides to award a Chinese company the rights to drill natural gas, rights held by a big US company, who were outbid. The US company now tries to merge with a smaller US company who has won drilling rights in Kazakhstan, one of the largest untapped oil reserves in the world. The smaller company is such an unlikely candidate that the authorities begin to investigate what dirty deals took place. A DC law firm is hired to investigate the desired merger, to see if any laws were broken by either company by payoffs, etc. The Emir of the country is old, wants to retire and he has two possible successors in his sons. One is older, socially progressive, with a Ph.D and shady connections to enemies of the US through arms deals, while the other is a young twentysomething, more open to cooperating with the US and open to not be overshadowed by his older brother. A young oil worker is laid off, joins a madrass, comes under the influence of his radical teacher and has the makings of a bad guy... <br /> <br />Strong performances by the supporting cast, but George Clooney and Matt Damon's characters are not very dynamic or particularly interesting. Unfortunately, the film fails to develop and weave the subplots together in a succinct fashion. I kept waiting for an \\"aha\\" moment when it would piece together in my mind nicely but that never happened. It's also a bit too slow. Too many characters who do little, are in the film. <br /> <br />Syriana is a timely film but it isn't clear enough to be a hit among mainstream audiences. Based on the book See No Evil: The True Story of a Ground Soldier in the CIA's War on Terrorism by Robert Baer, a former field officer for the CIA.
6300273199|5.0|...and I got it for less than $10.00 (including S&H), so IN YOUR FACE! Ahem. That being said, I think this awesome concert deserves to be seen in digitally-remastered DVD. I also recommend \\"Live at Donington\\", which is about twice as long as \\"Let There Be Rock\\" and includes some very cool Special Features. My rating (for the band & this tape): 10/10.
0142004235|3.0|Read the other reviews for plot synopsis and lit crit.  The reason for the three-star review: Oprah's Book Club edition (and this probably applies to the Centennial edition as well) of Steinbeck's epic masterpiece has been bespoiled by sloppy proofreading.  Riddled with typos and spelling mistakes galore, this edition is frustrating to read.  I typically don't buy anything with Oprah's name on it, but this tome was available used for only three bucks on Amazon, so what the heck.  Penguin is one of the premier publishers of classic literature, and I am heartbroken that Penguin chose to print something so rife with errors.  What disrespect to Steinbeck's genius.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Impressive, astonishing, delightful, inspirational, the best album of the year. Madonna knows better than anyone how to reinvent herself. But here she's also reinventing DISCO. This album is the real disco-future sound. Who in the world would think disco could revive again? It had to be Madonna, only a true star like her can rescue and readapt and make a whole new product as enjoyable as Confessions on a Dance Floor. Yes, she can make me feel better, definitly. Because she proves once more that age is not a limitation for being number one and achieve a tremendous success. Whom else can be number one simultaneously in 28 countries? Only Madonna, the Real Queen of Pop. This is real and pure pop, the best to dance to. SORRY stands out as the best pop and dance song since Ray of Light. I can't wait for the video. Go girl!!! Thanks for defending pop music that much!!!
B000A59PMO|5.0|I should be writing a research paper right now, but instead i am singing the praises of Veronica Mars!  Just as i did with Buffy, I came to Veronica at the start of the second season.  I immediately started getting that old Buffy feeling of excitement and anticipation as the days to a new episode approached.  Since the beginning of the second season I have been obsessively watching the first season, soaking up all of the wonderful backstory I missed.   <br /> <br />Logan Echolls is the absolute best character on television!  I love the complexity of his character - a beautiful blend of sarcasm, arrogance, and cynicism that artfully conceals his pain and truly deep capacity for love.  As much as I love Duncan and Veronica's relationship, I truly think Logan desrved her.  Watch and see what I mean!   <br /> <br />I hope you enjoy the first season, and help all of us keep this amazing series on the air!
B00005TPKD|5.0|This remastered edition of \\"Phallus Dei\\" is outstanding!! The terrific cover itself is now with fine colours, with the ladies getting more expression in the back of the naked tree full of birds... At the first seconds of \\"Kanaan\\", the first track, we can delight with a full-bodied sound, as listening the panic male voice at the entrance, telling us that something really creepy is gone happen...the \\"four\\" tribal minutes of \\"Kanaan\\" are a dazzling musical experience and the summoning of all powers of this innovative german group...this is really the new music of a new era, still fresh today!!! Almost forty years ago, how bold this was!!!  Second and third tracks, \\"Dem Guten, Schnen, Wahren\\" and \\"Luzifers Ghilom\\" are that kind of Amon Dl II status, something between humor and terror, a kind of new ethnic chanting with hypnotic rhythms...there's a gloomy waltz at the end of \\"Dem Guten...\\" introducing the next track, and here Current 93 had plenty of sounds to sampler for their frightening records...a cry in despair (Luzifer?), menacing drums and almost-hindu chants, again a lot of nasty chorus, a desperate violin...  \\"Henriette Krtenschwanz\\", the fourth track, is a little lighter tune, in fact is a disturbing and pointless march, here Renate Knaup trying to emulate some kind of witch...  \\"Phallus dei\\", the last track of this psychedelic masterpiece, is a extended magnific jam-session, divided into various movements, always getting the trance way...it's quite extraordinary the middle-section, a madness of bongos and turkish drums side-by-side with savage screams...  Anyway, a must-buy for any psychedelic/krautrock/progressive lover...and with this superb remastered edition, a must-must!!  (The bonus tracks are unreleased versions of later recordings of the band, a nice addition!!)
B000A59PMO|5.0|I missed this show in its first season and watched a few repeats over the summer based on reviews I had read in TV guide and on the net.  I loved it and immediately reserved the DVD.  The shows are generally well written and paced; A good mix of drama and humor.  The interactions between the characters are believable and the adults are not characteratures. It has heart and emotion without getting overly soapy.  I only wish I had been able to see it before the second season began. One of the few teen shows that I could stomach (I'm 47)
B0007GAERG|1.0|I feel betrayed. But that's the point, Mariah had to make an alliance with hip hop, r&b... for reviving her faded musical career... But no matter how well this CD sells, her glory moments of her first CD won't come back again. The Emancipation of Mimi is garbage, pure trash. People are blind, Mariah is not innovative. Too many \\"featuring\\" songs... Where's her personal touch, her seal? Almost all her songs sound the same. How can people recognize her as the best selling and most successful female artist of all times? That's a big mistake. Please, count the copies again, then talk. And Mariah, retire please, and take some acting classes. You're such a bad actress, and video-clips need to be believable, for they are short films.
B000002IMG|2.0|Anyone who knows anything about metal knows about the Big Four of Thrash: Anthrax, Megadeth, Metallica, and Slayer. Sometimes, however, you'll find Testament thrown into that list as well, but despite this, they never really made it to the upper echelons of Thrash Metal. <br /> <br />Listening to \\"The New Order,\\" I found it hard to describe why it was not \\"clicking\\" for me. The musicians were competent; Alex Skolnick is a decent lead guitarist and Chuck Billy's vocals are distinct, but the whole album left me distinctly unmoved. I could headbang forever to Megadeth's \\"Rust in Peace\\" or Slayer's \\"Reign in Blood,\\" but \\"The New Order\\" just left me bored. It was obvious then why Testament were never going to make the leap into the Big Four. \\"The New Order\\" is just lacking everything that made the Big Four so great. <br /> <br />What do I look for in good Thrash Metal? Brutal, memorable riffs, creative drumming, and an infectious sense of energy, drive, and well, THRASH! \\"The New Order\\" has very little of that. The stand-out tracks like \\"Disciples of the Watch\\" or \\"The Preacher\\" might offer up a few edible morsels of riffage to the riff-hungry, but the majority of tracks just peter out having left no impact on me whatsoever. The only other track worth mentioning is the Aerosmith cover \\"Nobody's Fault,\\" which is memorable simply for being different than the rest. The rest of the album is an absolute throw-away, leaving maybe an EP's worth of decent material. I literally cannot describe the rest of the tracks in detail because they all blend together into one big mass of bland, thrash cliches. <br /> <br />The dull songwriting and lack of memorable riffs are only compounded by the awful production. The guitars sound thin and tinny, and the drums lack force and impact. Compare this to the absolutely brutal production on Slayer's \\"Reign in Blood\\" and the sound of the \\"The New Order\\" becomes laughable. <br /> <br />Testament have always straddled a frustrating boundry between\\"decent\\" and \\"forgetable.\\" \\"The New Order\\" is, at times, \\"good\\" but not \\"great\\", and the rest of the time utterly disposable. Listening to Testament, one can see an occasional glimmer of good material, but it's swamped by mediocrity. Stay with your Big Four albums instead.
B00097DXZS|2.0|Santana is like an old oak tree -- some years there's an abundance of acorns, and other years there's a scarcity. This is a lean season, as the music seems more like muzak at times. I don't fault his effort, but the outcomes are not what his hard core fans look for. But like the mighty oak, Santana endures, and there no doubt will be other, more plentiful seasons ahead.
6302759110|5.0|From the title itself, Francis Ford Coppola's 1992 film version of the classic vampire story by Bram Stoker leads you to think that it will be a faithful interpretation by appending the author's name to the title, albeit the reason a mundane one for the adding of the author's name.<br /><br />It delivers all that and more. Having read the novel prior to viewing this visually stunning interpretation of the horror story, I expected nothing less from Mr. \\"Godfather\\" Coppola and WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED. The acting-from Gary Oldman as the titular Count-now turned romantic hero-, Winona Ryder as Mina, the woman who was his wife in a previous life (the excellent prologue which opens the film, which serves to shed light on the historical figure Vlad the Impaler; they didn't call him that for nothing, mind you), Anthony Hopkins as Dr. Abraham Van Helsing (stepping into a role done by the legendary Sir Laurence Olivier in the 1978 \\"Dracula,\\" starring Frank Langella), Keanu Reeves as Jonathan Harker, the hapless victim of the Count, Sadie Frost as Lucy Westenra, Mina's aristocratic friend, whose sexual appetites prove to be her undoing and a very young Monica Belluci as one of Dracula's lovely, but very lethal, brides, just to name a few of the many actors in this film-is excellent. The screenplay by James V. Hart improves on the original ending of the novel and makes Dracula the protagonist as well as the villain. The film's \\"R\\" rating was too damn harsh. Same thing for \\"Mary Shelley's Frankenstein,\\" which is the same kind of movie, only that there's no sex (just some passionate kissing as the camera moves around Victor and Elizabeth); see my review on it. Rated PG-13 for some violence and brief sensuality/nudity.

0553804367|4.0|This book shows the deep confusion in the current understanding of the cosmos. Entities like dark matter, dark energy, strings and many other oddities of modern science are discussed in one incomplete picture of the universe. Nature cannot be that whimsical and complicated. It has to be counterintuitive and simple in its basic terms. If you are looking for an elegant and complete picture of the universe then you may read Eugene Savov's Theory of Interaction the Simplest Explanation of Everything.

B0001AVZA8|2.0|It started off just fine. It got a little boring going along the storyline but I like Nicholson and I generally enjoy Keaton. HOWEVER, I thought Diane Keaton was an actress? When she was crying, in the film, I was more than annoyed! I turned it off completely. She's supposed to be an actress!!! I was very disappointed in her acting in this film and for that I give the movie 2 stars as I thought it could have been much better.

Since Arden has experience in the advertising industry, he knows how to keep my attention.  And that means it's not some how-to book with lots of text.  The book is meant to stimulate you, not cram you full of advice.  So, it's not \\"fluff.\\" <br /> <br />Though my copy was taken from me, I still remember many parts of the book and plan to buy another.  This book is indeed for everyone, not just those in advertising.  Arden merely uses his own experience in his field to make a universal point.
B000062XE1|3.0|\\"The Oscar Wilde Collection\\" includes four performances of Wilde's works, and a feature on the life of Oscar Wilde.  These were all broadcast on the BBC in the past, and they feature several well-known actors, such as Sir John Gielgud, Joan Plowright, Jeremy Brett, Susan Hampshire, Margaret Leighton, and more.<br /><br />\\"The Importance of Being Earnest\\" is one of Wilde's greatest works.  It was first performed in 1895, in the St. James' Theatre in London.  However, the performance here is not the original four act version of the play.  The written information lists this as being the 1988 production of the play, but the Internet Movie Database shows it as being from 1986, and one can see in the video credits that the 1986 data appears to be correct.  This is the story of two men, each of whom use an unreal person to give them an excuse to avoid unwelcome situations.  This practice ultimately results in causing more trouble than it avoids for each of them.  The performance is good, but far from exceptional.  Joan Plowright gives a decent performance as Lady Bracknell.<br /><br />\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is a performance based on Wilde's 1891 novel.  This production first aired in 1976, and I don't think it is very good at all.  The only thing worthwhile is the performance of Sir John Gielgud as Lord Henry Wotton.  Of course, this is the one work presented here which is not a play in its original form.  The story is of a man (Dorian Gray) who wishes he could stay young like his portrait, and have the portrait grow old in his place.<br /><br />\\"An Ideal Husband\\" is originally from 1895, and this is my favorite of the four productions included in this collection.  First broadcast in 1969, there are several great performances here.  Jeremy Brett is wonderful as Vicount Goring, and Margaret Leighton (Mrs. Cheveley), Dinah Sheridan (Lady Chiltern), and Keith Michell (Sir Robert Chiltern) all deliver strong performances as well.  The play involves blackmail, political corruption, and the idea that no one should be judged entirely by their past.<br /><br />\\"Lady Windermere's Fan\\" is a play from 1892.  This performance is from 1985, and as with \\"The Importance of Being Earnest\\" it is a good, but not great, performance.  This play is about the appearance of impropriety which nearly destroys Lord and Lady Windermere's marriage, when she learns that he is spending an unseemly amount of time in Mrs. Erlynne's presence and giving her large amounts of money.  Mrs. Erlynne is well played by Stephanie Turner.<br /><br />The feature titled \\"The Life and Loves of Oscar Wilde\\" is well done, and provides a great deal of insight into the man and his tragic end.that no one should be judged entirely by their past.    \\"Lady Windermere's Fan\\" is a play from 1892.

In other words, when it is funny, it's very funny, but when it misses the mark, it misses by a good ol' country mile.<br /><br />Will Ferrell goofs his way through this flick in sometimes funny, but mostly annoying, fashion.  Christina Applegate wasted herself here.  The \\"newsteam\\" that backed up Ferrell was boring.  I have to admit, though, that they captured the oafishness and all out idiotic mentality of most reporters.  I've worked with a few in my day when I was at a local station, and the majority of them aren't half as great as they think they are.  Their egos are bloated well beyond capacity.<br /><br />The funniest parts of this film are when other stars make cameo appearances.  Ben Stiller, Tim Robbins, Vince Vaughn, and Luke Wilson all have wonderful bit parts that result in hilarity.  The gem of the bunch has got to be Jack Black.  His burrito-induced road rage resulting in a punted pooch is classic.<br /><br />I don't recommend purchasing this flick.  It's not silly enough to be considered \\"brainless\\" humor and it is entirely too idiotic to be intelligently funny.  However, the few gutbusters that are found here are worthy of at least one viewing.  Pick it up as a rental and then let fate take over from there.
B000001FS3|5.0|Omigod I just creamed my pants at the very mention of U2. Together with those other Ultra Gods of Music, Led Zeppelin, nothing in the history of the universe is remotely as good as U2. If you don't worship these two bands you don't know jack about music.
B000BVEKO0|5.0|To me, this CD seemed experimental, to show how much the band has improved and matured over the years. It also includes some industrial sounding items, which is really cool. Overall, one of my favorites, and it's definately worth checking out. My favorite tracks are Hypocrites and Throw me Away.
B000B0WODA|5.0|I told a relative that I like Franz Ferdinand, and he said, \\"Well, what is their music like?\\" and I replied, without thinking, \\"They're sort of like The Beatles, but punk.\\"  I remembered that statement the next time I listened to this CD, so I looked for similarities to The Beatles, and came up with quite a few:  a sound that varies within certain borders but remains identifiable as their own;  music hard enough to be called Rock but pleasant enough to be Pop;  clever, sometimes cutting wit tossed off without malice (in \\"Do You Want To\\", the remarks about the famous friend, and in the title cut \\"I wasn't down, I just wasn't smiling at you\\");  and the willingness to experiment with different sounds and moods (horns in \\"Do You Want To\\", Beatle-like guitars all through \\"Walk Away\\", good echo effect on \\"Evil And A Heathen\\", interesting chord changes in \\"Eleanor Put Your Boots On\\", old Twenties-sounding piano in \\"Fade Together\\").  And \\"Outsiders\\", the final cut, features weird background sounds against a heavy beat, leading to a dramatic ending.  Now - although their first album was more uniform, even then it dropped like an A-bomb on the music world.  But I disagree with those who say that this one is practically the same as the first.  The sounds are more varied, the songs are more developed, and the lyrics, though often obscure, hint at pop poetry in the manner of John Lennon's.  For example, in \\"Eleanor\\" we hear \\"Leap until the Gulf Stream's brought you down/I could be there when you land\\".  And in \\"Outsiders\\", \\"It's bright on the outside/The bright love the dark side, I know\\", and later, \\"When you saw me sleeping you thought I was dreaming of you/I didn't tell you that the only dream is valium to me\\".  Maybe it's just me, but I find these thoughts remarkable.  So, is Alex another Lennon?  Only time will tell, but I think that Franz Ferdinand has the capacity to grow and reinvent themselves enough to become an important band, if that is their ambition.  Remember, it took The Beatles 13 albums to complete their legacy.took The Beatles 13 albums to complete their legacy.
0553801503|4.0|A Feast For Crows is the latest installment in George R.R. Martins' fantastic (thus far) series called A Song of Fire and Ice.  If you have not read any of the previous books then the first thing I suggest is you get the first book, A Game of Thrones.  This is the type of series that one needs to start at the beginning.<br /><br />That stated, A Feast For Crows was a just a great story for me.  All the elements are there, sex, politics, betrayals, and just a hint of magic.  Its enough to keep you hooked for the next installment.  Now of course I could wax on about the literary quality of the narrative, but that is not what this book is about.  This book is about simply a great yarn, which is spun by an albeit long winded story teller.  If you're going to read a George R.R Martin book and you are the type of reader who can get the gist of the overall mood and visual part of the story then by all means simply skip the more meandering parts of it.  Even so, this is still such a great storyline that I'm most certainly going to come back for more.  I was a little disappointed that Daenarys POV was not included, but I feel that Arya and the Maid of Tarth POV more than made up for it.  I'm waiting anxiously for the next installment.
B000050XEI|5.0|Enya sings right from heaven, calming and soothing, but also touching, more than ever. If you are familiar with Enya's previous albums, you will fall in love with \\"A Day without Rain\\" immediately, right from the opening theme song. Most listeners will recognize \\"Only Time\\", probably Enya's best-known song. If you are new to the world of Enya, you will like her peaceful style, rich with voice harmonies sung by herself alone, ethereal melodies, and an accompaniment consisting of synthesized textures and string orchestra. If you want to let yourself relax, simply put on this CD and drift away. One final recommendation: if you like Enya's music, you will love Arye Geiman, a very romantic composer, whose music really awakens your imagination. You can listen to it on the CDBaby web site.
B000BMSTMS|5.0|This is Korns best, most mature album to date.The songs have a depth and musicality that no other Korn album has ever had.Be sure to get the Duluxe Limited Edition Version because the song \\"last legal drug\\" is the best track on the entire album..This album is a must for all Rock Fans...
B000B7BRMM|4.0|Those of us who felt a little uncomfortable with Diana Krall's last two studio albums will be relieved to learn that for this foray into the old Christmas roast chestnuts she has managed without the services of both her husband and the over-lush full orchestra with which they were handicapped. Further than that, she has resisted the usual temptation to slip in a new or self-penned song, so that we are spared the inevitable, if unfair, comparison with the songs which stood the test of their 50+ years longevity. <br /> <br />She does bring to the party the Clayton/Hamilton Jazz Orchestra, who blow smoothly and roundly behind her on the more uptempo numbers - actually I thought they were a bit too polished and could have done with a bit more in the power department. Nevertheless, \\"Jingle Bells\\", \\"Let It Snow\\", \\"Santa Claus Is Comin'...\\" and \\"Winter Wonderland\\" all swing along nicely, with Diana playing games here and there, ad-libbing and lapsing into scat, and evoking the ghosts of Christmases past - Ella and Dino and Sinatra. <br /> <br />Where the pace drops off is where Diana performs best - the more intimate, jazz quartet settings of \\"The Christmas Song\\" \\"I'll Be Home...\\" and \\"What Are You Doing New Year's Eve?\\" and, for anyone who has ever wanted to dance to \\"White Christmas\\", it's done in smoochy slow-time, as near to a waltz as the tune will allow. <br /> <br />Johnny Mandel contributes inimitably subtle and understated arrangements and orchestrations for three tracks, including the slinky \\"Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas\\" and Irving Berlin's dreamy lullaby \\"Count Your Blessings Instead Of Sheep\\", not actually a Christmas song but a perfect ending to the album.  <br /> <br />Throughout Diana sings, and plays her Steinway, with the clarity, elegance and polish we have come to expect over the last ten years or so. If I were picky I would say that it is perhaps a little too squeaky clean and clinical - it is arguably a good thing that there's a complete absence (musically) of neighing reindeer or jangling bells, but just a little more colour and passion would have been welcome and would have elevated this Christmas album to rank with the very best.
B00008G6EZ|5.0|[This DVD can also be bought as part of a recently released twofer that also includes the Zurich Opera production of Cos&igrave; fan tutte, also with Bartoli. I don't know if there is a price break for the twofer or not.]<br /><br />Of the three Don Giovanni DVDs that I own, I think I like this one best. First of all, musically it is superb. I've never heard a better Donna Elvira than that of Cecilia Bartoli; Elvira is meant to be a force of nature (yet a woman underneath) and Bartoli is certainly that. Her singing is, of course, unimaginably good. Her acting as the wronged Elvira crackles. And her momentary softening in Act II is also believable. Her 'Ah, fuggi il traditor' and 'Mi tradi' are simply outstanding, both musically and dramatically. Rodney Gilfry has a light, flexible baritone which is, I believe, precisely what Mozart wanted -- otherwise why would he have written the Champagne Aria to be sung at that killing tempo? -- and Gilfry has that. In addition, he is the handsomest Don around these days; he is charming, not playing the Don as an out and out villain but as a spoiled rich boy who feels entitled to whatever he wants. Gilfry, you will recall, created the part of Stanley Kowalski in Andr&eacute; Previn's Streetcar Named Desire, and obviously that required an animalistic quality that he is able to portray, appropriate for the role of the Don as well. Laszl&oacute; Polg&aacute;r as Leporello has a resonant bass-baritone, easily distinguished from that of the Don; but when they exchange places in Act II he lightens his voice (as Gilfry darkens his) and the impersonation seems believable. He plays Leporello as a darker, more saturnine character than we usually see, not just playing it for laughs as many do. His 'Madamina, il catalogo' is played for shock, not comedy, and sung very nicely, too.<br /><br />The other singers in this Zurich Opera production are just as good. Isabel Rey, a soprano with a rather soft-cored voice, is an aristocratic, noble Donna Anna. Liliana Nikiteanu is a properly peasant Zerlina, but no dummy. She shines, with Gilfry, in 'La ci darem la mano.' Don Ottavio is sung by the Italian lyric tenor, Robert Sacc&agrave;, and his 'Il mio tesoro' is a highlight. Oliver Widmer does well by Masetto, although his acting is a bit generic; the voice is flexible and his participation in the various ensembles is fine. (By the way, I could not get 'Batti, batti, o bel Masetto' out of my head for hours after I heard Zerlina sing it to him. Well, if you have to have an earworm it might as well be Mozart, no?)<br /><br />Matti Salminen is a suitably sonorous Commendatore. Why he appears in person, rather as the statue, at the end of the opera I don't know. This is not a particularly tradition-breaking production although the costumes are a sort of generic early 19th-century sort, and the sets are minimalistic. This is a dark Don Giovanni but the lighting is so expert that one does not have the feeling that one is having to squint to see the singers. This  is due partly because the camerawork -- the video was directed by the redoubtable Brian Large -- is expert. There are lots of close-ups and two-shots and they are appropriately chosen, often being of reactions rather than trained on the singer of the moment. A nice touch. Orchestral and choral support is wonderful, all under the direction of a conductor whom I admire more and more: Nikolaus Harnoncourt.<br /><br />The opera is spread over two DVDs -- for a total of 275 minutes which includes a 'behind the scenes' extra with commentary by Harnoncourt, Bartoli, Gilfry and Rey. Sound is PCM Stereo or Dolby 5.1; Subtitles: Italian, German, French, English, Spanish, Japanese.<br /><br />I recommend this Don Giovanni for its dramatic as well as its musical values.<br /><br />Scott Morrisona Anna.

B000BEZQ18|5.0|whatever you like it or not. Brokeback Mountain is one of the best film of this year, this ost also. the score and the song were perfectly mingled. if a ost can make you feel the story that the movie want show to you, it's the best ost. this one did it to me .when you close your eye, just listening, you'll feel longly, strugle,just like the hero in the movie. after a long time waiting, the quality of this soundtrack is beyond my expection.by the way,i love the country style
6305736650|5.0|If you were to read my reviews you would see that I often comment that a classic movie or book isn't as great as it's cracked up to be.  For example, Citizen Kane is a mediocre movie, and 8 1/2 is nothing.  Shakespeare comedies are often little more than stupid, sorry re-runs of each other, with the same stupid tricks in them.  The Scarlet Letter by Hawthorne is silly garbage, as is the rest of Hawthorne's writing.  I'm an iconoclast.  I don't do it to be different.  I do it because I believe it.  I call them as I see them.<br /><br />Casablanca is in the running for the greatest movie ever made.  It is uplifting and emotional.  You can't ask for more.<br /><br />One of my favorite scenes is the one in Rick's when the Germans begin singing their song, and Laszlo decides not to take it.  He orders the band to play the Marseillaise, and the crowd at Rick's drowns out the Germans.<br /><br />The symbolism is obvious rather than subtle, but I like it that way.  I like the way the French police captain tosses a bottle of Vichy water into the trash and kicks it.  It's not a little \\"in\\" joke for the initiated.  It is as subtle as a rap in the head.  That's the way it should be.<br /><br />World War Two was the single most important event in human history.  You can't get emotional about other wars.  They are all controversial.  This one isn't.  This was the only war I know of that was really good vs evil.  Other wars are shades of gray against each other, with both good and evil on both sides.<br /><br />I'm sure you know the plot.  I just need to cast my vote and reward this wonderful movie with the highest rating.
B00000IMTF|5.0|The best work Dio and/or Blackmore have ever done. This record is perfect. Inspired playing, writing and singing, combined with flawless production...it's all there.     The fact that the album only has a hanfull of songs serves as a benefit ,because you don't get bogged down or bored with any 'half-baked mid-album filler...'Stargazer' is one of the best songs I've ever heard in any genre of music, and the ONLY time I've ever enjoyed an orchestra alongside a rock band...BUY THIS ALBUM,IN FACT, BUY 2 AND GIVE ONE TO A FRIEND!!
B00005JOHI|5.0|I saw Pride and Prejudice for the third time today, and it just gets better each time. I see a lot of movies, and it is refreshing to see a movie that is sexy without actually showing any sex. Kiera Knightly is gorgeous,and yes, I did see the Colin Firth version, and I adored him in Bridget Jones, but I'll take Matthew McFadyen in a heartbeat over Colin Firth. The first time I saw it I left the theater behind two women my age (boomers) with three teenage girls, the youngest of whom said \\"Mom, I want a Mr. Darcy\\", to which the mother replied \\"We all do!\\" I know there are many devotees of the BBC version, but I think comparing the two is like comparing apples to oranges. I may go see this again, and I have never in my life said that about any movie. Can't wait for the DVD!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|She's said it, \\"I don't have the best voice or am the best dancer\\" but what she does best is set trends and paths that others will follow. She's the quintessence of the concept bercool.  <br /> <br />As she did with her amazing Ray of Light album, she let's us hear it for the first time, frown, wonder what it was all about and without being conscious  we hit the play button again to let it all sink in little by little. Slowly we imagine Studio 54 circa 2006, were the guys are Tony Marero, they know how to dress sharp and groove and the ladies wear spandex and hot pants paired up with Manolos. The Queen made the 70's be hip again...for all of those who said that disco was dead, mourning is over !  <br /> <br />The flow of album is amazing, you can dance through it without problems, and yes \\"I Love New York \\" has \\"dorky\\" lyrics, but so did disco hymns like More,More,More (Andrea True Connection), YMCA  (Village People) or Shake your booty (KC & the Sunshine Band). And to have hebrew and electronic music get you on your dancing feet is no easy task. <br /> <br />So dig up the discoball and put some Studio 54 in your life, Madge  has done it again !
B000BKJ78U|5.0|It's really silly with people giving this set a low rating because its exactly like the original DVD release without bonus disc. <br />I've been holding off purchasing the DVD trilogy because I think $50 is just too expensive.  So this is really nice $15 cheaper without the bonus disc.  I can just rent the bonus disc from netflix.  So thank you George. <br />The 3 disc in this set is exactly the same as the original DVD release.  Its not like he added on extra commentary track and call it the definitive version.  Which means Lucas give people choice to buy this set for cheap or go for the \\"deluxe\\" with bonus disc.  It's choice not rip off, people.  Geez nobody forcing you to buy this if you already have the original DVD set, heck nobody forcing to buy this anyway.

6305508550|4.0|After being pestered my many people for years to see this movie, I have finally gotten around to it.  The thing I guess I should say first is that while this is definitely a very funny movie, I think that it is somewhat overhyped.  I don't want people to think that it doesn't deserve most of the praise it receives, for it is very enjoyable and very accurate.  However, it isn't as groundbreaking/defining as many people make it out to be.  Still, it's a fun movie that everyone should see at least once. <br />Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston) is a mid-level corporate drone working for a generic software company, and it doesn't look like he's going anywhere in life.  His best friends Michael Bolton (David Herman), who has no relation to the singer, and Samir Nagheenanajar (Ajay Naidu), who is tired of Americans being unable to pronounce his name, are also employed at Initech, and have similar outlooks for the future.  The three spend their days hitting the printer that always jams and going to Chotchkie's, a TGIFridays-type restaurant that employs the beautiful Joanna (Jennifer Aniston), who Peter constantly pines for.  The other people in Peter's life include Anne (Alexandra Wentworth), his girlfriend whom he believes is cheating on him, Lawrence (the underused Diedrich Bader), his construction worker neighbor, Milton (Stephen Root), a mumbling coworker whose only loves in life are his radio and his red Swingline stapler, and Bill Lumbergh (Gary Cole), his evil, soulless boss who makes him work on the weekends and always starts sentences with \\"Uh, yeah, what's happening?\\". <br />When Peter is brought to see an occupational hypnotherapist, the doc does wonders for him.  He is able to get Peter completely relaxed, but before he can wake Peter up, he keels over from a heart attack.  Now, Peter hasn't a care in the world.  He skips work, breaks up with Ann, and asks out Joanna.  And amazingly, just when Lumbergh is going to fire him, two \\"efficiency consultants\\" (played by John C. McGinley and Paul Willson) observe Peter's behavior and believe that he just isn't being challenged enough at work, and they reccomend him for a promotion! <br />Eventually, using his newfound apathy, Peter decides that they should make good on Michael's constant quips about how he could write a virus that could scam Initech for millions.  Of course, things don't go as planned, and the results are of coures hilarious. <br />This movie has often been lauded as being one of the greatest corporate satires ever made.  While I believe that it does get many things right, I don't think that this is anything new.  That doesn't prevent the movie from being funny, though.  Lumbergh's whole schtick about his personality and mannerisms is one of the greatest characterizations I've seen in years.  Furthermore, the whole Milton subplot where he is constantly being relocated by Lumbergh is fun just to see what Milton will mumble next.  I also now understand a lot of the things that I've heard people say in regards to this film (the case of the Mondays things is the most prominent). <br />Overall, this is a film that most people, especially those who work for corporations like Initech, should see at least once.  My biggest gripe was the use of a lot of rap music, which I don't particularly care for, so if that's the biggest problem, that's not bad at all.  While it may not deserve all the hype it receives, there is still a lot of good to be said for Office Space.
0743454537|3.0|There is something about this book that makes it very readable- a page turner even- but something else that made me hate it.   <br />The subject matter is extremely interesting- and something you don't normally hear about- but the way that it's written is, at times, cringe inducing.   <br />This was my first experience reading one of Picoult's books- what struck me most about her writing style is her apparent love of cliches.  You can pick out at least one on every page.  I'm assuming this is an effort to make her characters seem smooth- maybe \\"real\\".  After the first 100 pages, it gets annoying. <br />Her dialouge is bulky and, while I know my share of bright \\"old for their age\\" 13 year olds, I don't know any who are as smooth as the character of Anna.     <br />She describes everything- which can be nice, but, as an acting teacher once told me, \\"you should never guild the lily.\\"  Picoult's lily is dripping... <br /> <br />The story itself was extremely interesting, and I finished the book in spite of not caring for the writing style.  The ending is a surprise, and in a way, it may have been more interesting to read a book about THAT story than this one... (I don't want to go further into it to avoid spoilers...) <br /> <br />This was a nice, guilty pleasure read- the equivilant of a Sunday spent watching Lifetime movies...
B000BVEKO0|5.0|I must say, this album is nothing short of excellence. I myself do miss the old Korn albums. But this new step is bigger and better than ever. Im soo glad they took the time with this album and didnt rush it. I strongly advise getting this album. In my opinion, this is the best album to come out of Korn since Issues. I can't stop but to look forward to see what Korn will come up with next. Again, get it.
0316921173|2.0|I gave up after a hundred pages. There is no question about the author's ability to write, or his quick mind, but I tired of reading about potheads years and years ago. There is now no more tedious subject in literature than drugs unless it is self-gratification. And in the early portions of this book the dope stories follow each other like penguins in a queue. Other material seems like Saturday Night Live skits gone haywire. One admires the craft here, but the author doesn't give the reader anyone or anything to care about.  <br />

B000BM6AVA|5.0|The second half is here finally. SOAD's \\"Hypnotize\\" is pure marketing genius. Who would of \\"thunk it\\" by splitting this two CD set and selling each half at separate times? I think the ultimate plan came out of the recording sessions by the band.<br /><br />  \\"Hypnotize\\" DualDisc is worth the price of admission. There is a big difference on the enhanced stereo sound of the DVD. The songs tend to jump out and clarify. I really didn't know there was a difference until I played it in my home digital surround sound system. Awesome clarity! I first played the CD side in my trucks system and thought it was a great sound. But after the home system sound was revealed how could I ever play this CD side again. As a bonus the artwork of both albums are revealed when playing the DVD songs.<br /><br />  The DVD contains a behind the scenes of the making of both \\"Mezmerize\\" and \\"Hypnotize.\\" This one was perplexing because of the quality of the scenes shot. The scenes were of fuzzy and hidden like camera angles? It was like when you first got a digital camera and was shooting the different styles of filters. That was difficult to watch. But the interaction with the band was priceless. They are discussing the lyrics and meaning of the songs. The \\"BYOB\\" and \\"Question!\\" videos are awesome on a digital player.<br /><br />  Okay, the songs of \\"Hypnotize.\\" SOAD starts the \\"Attack\\" on the first track. Then into \\"Dreaming\\", \\"Kill Rock N Roll\\" and \\"Hypnotize.\\" All of these are consistent with SOAD's sound. The expermention still exists with \\"Stealing Society\\", \\"Tentative\\", \\"U-Fig\\" and \\"Holy Mountains.\\" The bizarre \\"Vicinity of Obscenity\\" and the drug related song \\"She's Like Heroin.\\" Then it is time to chill with a slower pace with the relatable \\"Lonely Day\\" and the long awaited complete \\"Soldier Side\\" ends \\"Hypnotize\\" but starts \\"Mezmerize.\\" This is a vintage SOAD CD.<br /><br />  SOAD's DualDisc was worth the extra price because of the enhanced stereo sound. But I shopped around and got a price well below the CD only price.price.
B0000640SB|5.0|My parents first bought this when it came out because they knew I loved star wars and this had aliens so they bought it. I loved it! It has some of the best actors, Tommy Lee Jones is one of my favorite actors, and Will Smith was great. This was probably Smith's first big movie, the biggest thing before that  was The fresh prince of Bel-air. The story is that there is an agency that protects the earth from aliens and things like that, well K ( Tommy Lee Jones) recruits J (Smith) and they have to find an alien that landed out in a farm. This alien is wearing an Edgar suit (one of the farmers skin) and it is trying to find \\"the galaxy\\" and is killing people on his way. Funny in parts, really good movie. Nothing like star wars but in a good way. I'm not sure if the 2nd is any good as I haven't seen it, but I heard it sucked so stick to the 1st.

And boy was it worth the wait. <br /> <br />I would rate the book as a 4.9 as there are niggling production issues (which in no way take away from the content of book).  <br />For eg. there is a faint smudge on the top left of every page of the first volume (I haven't come round to opening the remaining volumes. the cloth stuck to the slipcase at the inside edge is peeling of (I probably will have to use glue to stick it back.

Not true. Especially if you were a casual follower of the strip.  <br /> <br />I read about a month worth of strips at a time twice a day. Once in the morning and once at night.

0393327655|5.0|I suspect that most people who gave this book one star haven't read it. They probably also haven't read the Bible. I would encourage believers to read both. Harris makes a good case, if not an obvious one. Divorcing belief from reality can never be a good thing, and ethical conduct requires no belief in a primitive, tribal war \\"god\\" or, for that matter, any other patent religious absurdity.
B00008G7UJ|5.0|After peeking at the reviews already written for this movie, I thought that perhaps I could share my two cents. <br /> <br />First of all, no. This is not set in the 16th century. This is not in Italy. They do not use actual swords (though if you watch, most of their guns are named after the classic 16th century weaponry).  <br /> <br />However, that's not what Baz Luhrmann was after. He wanted to take the story and, with as few script/theme/feeling changes as possible, make it present day. He wanted to show audiences the timelessness of the story, the ways in which it still could apply to modern times and modern people. He managed to create a feud between two families that seemed a real and common part of these characters' lives, while still managing to convey a true love story. Some may think that the love is too playful, too childish, but that's what Shakespeare wrote! Juliet was supposed to be so much younger than she is in this (but, again, to make this fit with present day, someone of marrying age needed to be used), and the love is between two young people who are just learning what love really is. <br /> <br />I love the film. I think the soundtrack and the setting work well together, giving a 1990's feel to the story, but Luhrmann's attention to phrasing, to detail, amazes the watcher with its Shakespearean accuracy. <br /> <br />The move is worth an open mind, if nothing else. Even for those who don't \\"get\\" Shakespeare, or maybe especially for them, this is a way to appreciate his story without a freshman English teacher or a lot of confusion.
0375758992|4.0|It is told from an interesting perspective, and while you learn a lot as told through a child's eyes, the plight of Africa is haunting. In addition, the saga provides a child's sense of her parents, and their daughter's awareness or maybe more significantly, lack of awareness of their lives. The insights are wonderful.
B000BVEKO0|5.0|I have been waiting for Korn's new album to come out since I heard the news. It was all worth it. In my opinion this is one of Korn's best albums, aside from Life Is Peachy, and Issues. I give it 5 stars. 2 thumbs up. Twisted Transistor is the song that lured me in, but it is only a small piece of all the good music that came from this new album. It was definitely worth it. - Cassie Aylward
B000BB1MI2|5.0|I love the concept of the movie and the message behind.  The Chocolate Factory provides a space for creativity of the future.  This Chocolate Factory can symbolize human being's mind and the space of the creativity.  And when the story goes along, it talks about why Johnny Depp start losing his creativity of chocolate flavor when he feels horrible inside because of the pain he carried.  This is just like in human lives, when we are struggling some kind of an emotional pain, the factory (the mind), will lose its way to create, to bring joy (chocolate symbolizes joy/happiness) to others. <br /> <br />It is one of the greatest movie for adults and kids to watch together, especially during holiday season. <br /> <br />Musicals are fantastic and there are lessons kids need to learn behind it from those other kids who went to the factory at the same time too.  The kids who are spoiled, greedy, obnoxious, arrogant.  What a way to capture and portray these people in the widescreen for kids to learn how to be open and kind.  <br /> <br />I just love everything about the movie personally.  Thank you for reading my review.
0060751967|3.0|The premise of this book - a vampire who seeks emergency dental work from a 24 hour dentist who is afraid of blood was a hoot. The first half of the book runs with the offbeat plot, managing to mix in a good bit of humor, action and sexual tension. It was really a great read. But then something went wrong. The book began to take itself too seriously, forgoing wacky original humor. It began to sound like every other vampire book out there that has to include government secret ops and cardboard villains. For the first two thirds of this book, I found it difficult to put down. By the end of the book I was drained of all desire to read the inevitable follow-up. I also felt letdown because the problems inherit in the relationship are not resolved and I can't imagine a long term happily every after for the couple as matters stand at the end of the book. <br /> <br />This book will appeal to those who appreciate clever character banter, quirky plots and are not put off by novel sexual situations. Recommended with reservations. <br />
B000AP04FG|4.0|Depends on what you are up to when you are watching this movie.  If you want to stare at the eye candies of actors and actresses... and if you are looking for action movies, this is the ultimate big ticket.  Funny movie in its dark, humorous way, bringing the everyday husband and wives struggles to the widescreen in subtle ways.  We don't really think we know our husband/wife well because we are too busy in our daily lives, right?  Couple therapies...  nowadays it probably becomes more common in our society. <br /> <br />But in any ways, it is an entertaining, fun, humorous movie to watch to unwind a day.  If you are looking for something to critique about, argue about,  appreciate about ... or wanting to sink into deep/emotional thinking of the movie, you will be very disappointed by this one.  But hey... we all need movies like this that is fun and witty to watch once a while, right?
B0000DDAU9|5.0|Before the romanticists of primitivism came along, Thomas Hobbes' creed made life in the state of nature out to be something like \\"continual fear and danger of violent death,\\" where man's existence was \\"nasty, brutish, and short.\\" Sort of like Mastodon! This album set them up to become to become the chiefs of mdoern American heavy metal. Make no mistake -- Mastodon may be a lean, mean sophisticated bunch of metallers, but the dominant feature is its dirty, blunt aggression. Nowhere on this album does Mastodon strive to show everyone how talented they are by using fancy clean vocals or prog-metal trickery. Music comes across in rumbling sheets of distortion, waves of crunch like a cacophony of splintering skulls. Polyrhythms of growling riffage and frantic drums is the course for the most part, but there are a few quieter instrumentals. These are the weakest parts of the disc. Yet the rough and tough songs shine, where Mastodon has the subtlety of their namesake's stampede and the primitive drive to smash skulls and gobble raw, dripping animal flesh ('cuz that's how cavemen are, y'know). azz-kicking American metal.
B000BVEKO0|5.0|I'm loving it. <br /> <br />Korn's 7th studio album is by far the best they have released.  I, like most people, thought that their debut cd was the best, but this cd meets and far beyond exceeds that.  I have heard people compare this cd to \\"Follow The Leader,\\" and I've heard them compare them to \\"Untouchables.\\"  Both are completely wrong.  This cd sounds NOTHING like former KoRn.  Jonathon Davis recently said on their website that they wanted to experiment with industrial music.  Some bands don't efficiently do it when they experiment with it.   <br /> <br />KoRn made this an exceptional release.  Each song has its own life. <br /> <br />\\"Twisted Transistor\\" has been played all over the radio, and if you haven't heard it, call and request it.  \\"Politics\\" is the second track and it expresses the fustration a lot of people have to those who are so a*al that they have their heads stuck up in the sand that are so wrapped up in politics.  This is Davis's and KoRn's rebuttle that politics is retarded.  \\"Hypocrits\\" is a song that Jonathon Davis open face smacks Brian \\"Head\\" Welch for leaving the group.  The opening line, \\"Your Messiah was never Mine\\" repeats 10 times over and you can sense Davis's fustration with Head leaving, after Head was such a crucial piece of the band.  \\"Souvenir\\" is by far my favorite track on the cd, followed by \\"Coming Undone\\" and \\"Liar\\" which are the closest to the old-KoRn sound.  \\"10 or a 2 Way,\\" and \\"Getting Off\\" are both songs that reference sex, with \\"Getting Off\\" talking about masturbation.  \\"Liar\\" is a good song because it explains how a lot of girls just want to use guys for their money and then run because they are heartless.  One line says \\"She wanted what you had, you bet she smelt the spore...dont give up, F**k her up, one more time close the door.\\"  \\"Tearjerker\\" is a very slow song where you hear Davis's voice down to earth.  Oh, and to the person who compared it to a Britney Spear's pop song...may I ask what you smoked for breakfast?  'Cause you need to lay off it.  It's nowhere near a Spears pop song.   <br /> <br />\\"Its me again\\" and \\"Last Legal Drug\\" are the strong points on disc 2.  If you buy the deluxe cd from Target, you get a free download of \\"Too Late I'm Dead\\" from KoRn's site. <br /> <br />I'd highly reccomend you buy the \\"XXX: State of the Union Soundtrack\\" with this cd, where KoRn teams up with Xzibit to remake Public Enemy's \\"Fight the Power\\" and place that track in the cd list instead of \\"Getting Off,\\" which, to me, is the only weak song on the cd. <br /> <br />THIS CD IS HIGHLY HIGHLY RECCOMENDED.  By far the best cd of 2005.  It is a must have. <br />
B000009HF2|5.0|frampton comes alive would definitely compete for the status.    Great tunes (rock 'n roll and ballads), fantastic fretwork, a great backup band and magical band/audience chemistry marks this live double album which after nearly 30 odd years of release has still managed to retain a hallowed status in the history of rock.     frampton was and is a very serious musician and you can tell it by the quality of music that he presents. the music on this show was drawn from the first few solo studio albums that frampton recorded and he is in fantastic form throughout.    'show me the way', 'baby i love your way' and 'do you feel ...' may be popular. but 'doobie wah', 'all i want ...', 'i'll give you money' and 'lines on my face' are just as good. plus a killer version of the stones 'jumpin jack flash'.    of special note is the frampton's virtuostic fretwork who along with blazing solos also uses the voice box to great effect.    great one of a kind album this!    this album defines the magical 70s!
0670033375|4.0|I liked the central theme of the book and it is a 'must read'. <br /> <br />However Jared could have delved into a little less detail; I found myself skimming through sizeable portions of the book. <br /> <br />
0689859414|5.0|My nine-year-old daughter, who has been reading the Spiderwick Chronicles series, saw this in the store and couldn't keep her hands off of it. She asked for it over and over, until we gave in and bought it. We don't regret it! It brings all of the creatures she has been reading about to life in stunning artwork. Every drawing shines with personality, and I have found myself examining them, as well--lots of fun! One caution, though: several of the pages fold out and can be easily torn, so I wouldn't recommend this for really young children.
B000002A46|5.0|I have to say that I was driving in to work and was rather unhappy about having to go, but listening to this CD in my car made me forget all about my own issues and just enjoy the ride. I rejoiced and had a better day overall. She blew it out of the water with this one O What a Wonderful Child reminded me that Jesus is the reason for this season and Mariah has been annointed to sing His praises.
B00009ATIX|1.0|BORING!!! could have been alot better. plus the really sad thing is his wife is never really alive....talk about some emotionless acting! they must have just needed a pretty girl. a blow up doll would have had more personality.  <br />I watched with my sister and we both agree that it was and hour and a half too long.
B000BVEKO0|5.0|I think that this album has a new feel to it but I like it. I think their first album was the best but this one is on it's tail. I think it's definatly worth the money so buy the deluxe edition. I did and I love it.
0316666343|5.0|This book is so beautifully written that I managed to overlook the contrived ending.  It is a great story that strings words together in such a lovely way. Enjoy!
B000BVEKO0|5.0|This album is just amazing and is probably the best $25 I ever spent. The songs are just great, they do not necessarily sound like \\"typical korn songs\\" but they are awesome.  It seems there's a song on this album for everyone. There's heavier songs, songs with a real heavy, driving beat, and there's slow soothing songs. This is definately the best cd of 2005.
B000BBOUU4|3.0|I thought that all the magical effects that directors can sprinkle on their movies these days would make everything better, but this movie just showed me how unrealistic that can be. First of all the original tops this one, maybe not in special effects, but yes in everything else. The new one had no memorable music like the first one. The storyline didn't improve, and sort of cheap.  Johnny Depp was good, but not as good as the old Willy Wonka that he was trying to emulate. If you saw the original (like me) then I'm nothing going to stop you from watching it, otherwise, just skip it, rent the old one, or for your sake, go pick up a book. Oh.. I'm still afraid of Oompah-Loompahs!
B00003CXI1|5.0|I love this masterpiece as much as I love the book. After you read the book, watch this film, you will love it.
B000BVEKO0|5.0|the extra tracks kick butt, this is one of there best albums, if your a fan of the previous albums and the remixes that came with the singles, this is the album for you, it sounds so new and fresh. an almost new sound, with all the same great vocals and style that make you say that is KORN. enjoy. I am.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I loved this sequel. It is almost better than the original masterpiece. Another true classic. Get yours today.
B00005JOHI|4.0|To begin the movie with sensual and swelling music that makes your heart sinks at the sound of it, kept all of us on the edge of our seats for the whole time we were in the theater. I never thought it could happen; another adaptation that tops A&E's Pride and Prejudice and here it is! Though, there aren't as many words spoken within some scenes, but just by looking at the emotions spreading through the characters' faces and listening to that music was just enough!  <br /> <br />The filmmakers didn't go overboard with any effects that would break away from the true focal points of the movie. There were a few dramatic shots, but it was for the good of the movie; we all can understand that. Just let the music and actors do their job of equaling it out. What I loved the most was how they've paid attention to the little details that just makes a difference in a shot: how they've kept capturing Macfadyen (Darcy) from a far angle, watching Lizzy; the servants and farm animals in the background; and the differentiation behind the make up and hair in each scenes to say that: Lizzy Bennett did love to walk. <br /> <br />Keira Knightley is a lovely actress who played her role magnificently, but to my idea, she could have been a little more into her character instead of letting the cameras do all of the work; nonetheless, she'd played well enough to convince us that she WAS a worthy Lizzy Bennett.  <br /> <br />Matthew Macfadyen gave me second thoughts about Colin Firth, who was my favorite Darcy, until now. Macfadyen is a charming actor (not to mention, a heartthrob, for some of the girls) on screen; who made the situation even worst by playing the tall, dark, handsome, and mysterious, Mr. Darcy. I was blown away by his talent of being so much in character that I WAS convinced that he WAS Mr. Darcy. When he proposed for the first time to Lizzy Bennett (Knightley) nearly everyone in the theater gasped; not only for his confession, but how he had said it. Now, at this point, I was falling out of my seat. <br /> <br />Those two, with the combination of the brilliant casting made the movie complete.  <br /> <br />You don't need to read the book to understand what the heck is going on; you don't need to know every details of the characters' life to like it; and you don't need to worry about any details to look for. Just enjoy this movie, for it will lift you away, keep you at the edge of your seats and your hearts will never cease to stop fluttering until two hours after the movie. Definitely a must see!
B00008DDXC|5.0|This was even better than the book and the first movie. You will love it.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|Can we argue that: if the movie was great and the music must be great, too? The score for the Pride and Prejudice (2005) is one of the best CDs I have in my collection. If it weren't for the music, the movie wouldn't be half as good! It gives the audience a new set of things to swell into and not just watch the pictures flash by their eyes; the music just sets the different tones. There was a splash of melancholy, childishness and cheerfulness, sensuality and compelling here and there. Yes! I just fit in perfectly with the movie. Dario Marianelli's score is absolutely magnificent; he deserves this second streak of greatness (the score he'd composed for The Brothers Grimm was also amazing!)  <br />  <br />With every track, it leaves the listener something new: either a rapidly pulsating heart or Goosebumps that just keeps running up and down your skin. The second part of DARCY'S LETTER was haunting; YOUR HANDS ARE COLD will remind the listener every details of the scene it was played in; and LIZ ON TOP OF THE WORLD has its moment when it swells at its climax, at that instant, chills ran.  <br /> <br />The soundtrack is absolutely astounding!
B00005JMAH|1.0|After two great films, we get this rush job. This film is almost nothing like the book and there are glaring continuity errors with Chris Columbus' films. Ignore this hack job and stick with the first two films and the book series.
B000BKJ78U|1.0|This has got to be the biggest travisty in the history of DVD.  THE SAME DISCS AS THE LAST RELEASE?!! In a new fancy box? Minus one disc? WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU GEORGE!? I was under the impression that these would be the long awaited Originals. But NOOO! I bought it and now i'm mad.  I'm stuck with this horrible \\"new\\" box set, and now i cannot return it, because the store i bought it at has a strict policy about opened DVD's.  can't the stores make one DVD an exception, this \\"new\\" box set?  IT'S THE SAME THING AS LAST YEAR!!!!!!!!!!!  DON'T BUY THIS!!!
B000BC8TBE|5.0|One high note from Miss Carey, and your skin then becomes covered with goosebumps. What a rare talent Mariah has, there is truly no one on this planet who possesses the vocal prowess of Mariah Carey.On this album her voice pierces you like a lighthouse guiding  ships to shore. Her talent and voice is so amazing it could light a  dark room, and this album displays it. Fans, and non-fans a like will love this Christmas Cd. Whether its Silent Night that warms your soul, or Jesus, Oh What a Wonderful Child that will have feeling like you just stepped out a church. All of the songs are spectacular, but wow, O Holy Night, leaves me speechless...at when she sings, \\"...ohh night devineee\\" she jumps two octaves and sings a C7 which is remarkable. People can say what they want about Miss Carey, but you cant deny that superb instrument!  <br />     You will not be disappointed by this Album, its amazing. The Dual Disc comes with God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen, and and new mix of Santa Clause is Coming to Town.
B000BVEKO0|5.0|Korn, after the worst of their efforts \\"Take a Look in the Mirror\\" comes back with a boom as See you on the other side is launched. Having bought the actual deluxe edition I can say its well worth your money for the extra disk. That and you recieve an one year membership to the korn BSC fanclub. An awsome value in my opinion. <br /> <br />Imagine, a new korn cd that is completely different from what they've done before. A masterpiece and a must have.
B000BVEKO0|5.0|I was a little nervous about the new KoRn album, I heard it was experimental and without Head as a second guitartist i was a little worried. But I heard Twisted Transistor and I fell in love with that song, I heard the album on MTV2s The Leak and I fell in love with all the songs! So the day it came out I ordered my copy of the Deluxe Edition and I haven't stopped playing it since. It's a change in their style of music, but it still has the ever recognizable sound of KoRn, it's their best album yet, It'd deffinitly worth buying and promting it? Better Yet! If there was a 6 outta 5 rating I'd give KoRn that, the other side rocks. SEE YOU THERE!! Songs That I really enjoyed on the album are; Tearjerker, Getting Off, Love Song, and Twisted Transistor!!
B0002S947K|5.0|If you dont own this record, get it immediately.  Ray LaMontagne has a beautiful signature sound that is sure to last for quite awhile.  Look forward to his future recordings.
B000AL730O|5.0|This is Paul's strongest album of his career.  Each track is strong, edited down with great lyrics.  The sound quality of the songs are great.  Paul's voice is right up at front and sounding good.   <br /> <br />Most of Paul's other albums have classic songs on them, but there are almost always weak, filler tracks.  There are no weak tracks on Chaos and Creation in the Backyard putting this one above his very best. <br /> <br />My favorite: \\"Fine Line\\" \\"Jenny Wren\\" and \\"The Never Happened Before.\\"
B000AADYRQ|3.0|This review is for those not yet familiar with Death Cab for Cutie. I was new to the DCfC bandwagon myself, and this album (plus Transatlanticism) came highly recommended, so I listened to them. Good music but nothing to write home about. <br /> <br />Overall, this is very mellow pop, kinda Coldplay meets the Beatles. Unfortunately, much closer to Coldplay's average fare. Mid-tempo beats with sappy melancholy piano and vocals (reverb added for spacious sound). I have not paid too much attention to the lyrics, but from what I heard, it's mildly depressing stuff like this quote from the first track: \\"Sorrow drips into your heart through a pinhole\\" <br /> <br />The quality of the songs is very consistent: three stars throughout, and they all sound almost identical. This in itself is perhaps the most impressive quality of DCfC's music. They remind me of Enya -- once you heard one album, you heard them all. Except that Enya does have a few relatively memorable tracks here and there while these guys are super consistent. <br /> <br />The best song on this album is What Sarah Said. Apparently, other reviewers agree. Listen to that song first to make up your mind. <br /> <br />I know why Death Cab for Cutie sound like they need some Prozac: just like them, I am from Seattle, where it's gloomy and rainy most of the year. I bet the weather had something to do with their music. They obviously don't record in the summer since nobody would be stuck in a studio in the 90 sunny days of the year. That said, another Seattle fellow, Jimi Hendrix, puts DCfC to shame with his creativity and energy.
044651652X|4.0|The story about Francesca and Robert is romantic and sad, however, you know how the book will end the entire time.  If it wasn't doomed, then it wouldn't tug at your heart strings so much.  This is one instance where I actually enjoyed the movie as well as the book, but the book is better because it leaves more to the imagination.   <br /> <br />If you enjoy heartbreaking romances, this is the book for you!
B00000DHZJ|5.0|I was a total newbie to Hendrix's music. I had heard him played on the radio occasionally or on a friend's stereo, but never really paid much attention until I listened to this album. I do not want to get into details besides saying that the music is amazing. There are not many musicians of such deep genuine talent. The worst track on this album is way better than what many popular modern bands could ever hope to muster. Hendrix's style is original and very recognizable, and I fell in love with his music from the first serious listen. Nobody plays the electric guitar like he does. Now I know that eventually I will go out an buy more of his albums. If you are new to Hendrix, start here.
B000957O82|4.0|Admittedly, I am not a big fan of \\"romantic comedies\\" but this was one of the better ones I've seen. I liked this much better than, for example, \\"Monster In Law\\" which had two big names in it in the form of Jennifer Lopez and Jane Fonda. <br /> <br />Anyway, Will Smith does an excellent job as Hitch, a man dedicated to helping good but clueless men get the woman of their dreams. Along the way, he falls in love with a gossip columnist named Sara (Eva Mendes) who discovers who he is and exposes him.  <br /> <br />Will definitely takes this role as his own while Eva Mendes does keep up with him quite nicely as her character has issues of her own that she deals with during the film. The dude from \\"King Of Queens\\" is a show stealer as he makes jokes that would've been just funny or not funny at all freakin' hilarious! <br /> <br />I agree with the some of the previous reviewers about the content of the film. Though rated PG-13, you could actually almost leave your kids to watch this film as the sexual innuendos are almost non-existent and the bad language only pops up in a handful of scenes. Its almost suitable for families to watch. Make no mistake though, it is hilarious! Worth the price of buying.
B000002U82|5.0|What could anyone possibly say about Pink Floyd that hasn't already been said?? I stumbled across this album in my early teens while going through my dad's record collection. I thought the cover looked \\"cool\\" and decided to give it a listen. I had never heard anything like it. To my amazement, I loved it and was instantly hooked! Of course, back in those days it was never cool to like or even listen to the same music as your parents. I secretly listened to the album whenever my parents weren't around. Years later, The Darkside of the Moon has remained one of my all time favorite albums. <br /> <br />Though I wasn't a teenager or a young adult when this album made it's debut in the early 70's, it gives the listener a sense of being taken back in time to an era of flowers, peace signs, \\"make love not war\\" and bell bottoms. <br /> <br />All the songs on this album are great. It's difficult to pick out one song and say, \\"that's my favorite\\". The songs flow nicely and it's amazing what Pink Floyd was able to do by manipulating sounds without today's technology. My favorite way of listening to this album is cranked up and with headphones, or if you have surround system...crank it up. My nephews are now hooked on this album and guess who is the coolest aunt? Give the album a listen....you won't be disappointed.  <br /> <br />
B00008AWOG|5.0|In my opinion. Opeth's best album hands down which is hard to say since all of their albums are amazing, but there is something different about this album. Not only are all the songs catchy but the entire album tells a story. a \\"Concept Album\\" if you will. I'm not gonna go into details and make this review two pages long. But the story telling lyrics added to the songs is just mind boggling.
B00006I53S|4.0|I first bought the Canon EF 28-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM Zoom Lens to use with my Canon 10D along with the [[ASIN:B00004THCZ Canon EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 III USM telephoto zoom lens]].  About three years later I now have a Canon 20D and sold off the Canon EF 75-300mm f/4.5-5.6 USM for a better lens.  As for the Canon EF 28-135mm, I still have it and get plenty of use from it.<br /><br />This is not an L lens, but that is no reason to avoid this lens; no matter what level you shoot at.  The construction is sturdy and consists of 16 elements in 12 groups.  The focus type is the standard twist zoom, and permits for auto or manual focus depending on how the switch is set.<br /><br />The Canon EF 28-135mm lens is compact measuring 3.8 inches long and lightweight weighing in at about 1.2 lbs/540 g, and accepts 72mm filters. Since my other lenses accept 77mm filters, I use a [[ASIN:B0002E3WKO step-up adapter ring]] to limit the number of filters I have when I can. The f/stop ranges from 3.5 - 22 on the short focus range and 5.6-36 on the long with the f/5.6 starting at about 90mm.  The closest focusing distance is 20 in/50cm.  In addition, the lens has a USM drive mechanism for optimum AF performance, and the pulse control diaphragm (EMD) ensures precise aperture control.<br /><br />The IS system is composed of a pair of gyro sensors to detect vertical and horizontal motion and a microprocessor that compensates for it by shifting special lens elements in parallel with the perceived movement.  It is recommended that the IS be off when shooting on a tripod. I have used the IS on my [[ASIN:B00007E7IL Bogen 3231 professional monopod with deatchable legs]] successfully.  A monopod is not as stable as a tripod though, with or without the legs.  Using the IS, you can obtain sharp pictures two stops below where you normally would.  This is a huge advantage in dim light or places where flash is prohibited.  Just keep in mind, the IS attempts to eliminate camera movement, not the movement of the subject being photographed.<br /><br />A distance scale ring sits below the focus ring.  Turn the distance scale ring all the way to the left and you are set for low magnification close-up photography.  Turn it to the right and you are able to set for infinity compensating for changes in temperature as necessary.  The distance scale includes figures in red as an infrared index to use when shooting black and white infrared film.  Shooting infrared is not available on all cameras.  If this feature is a must, make sure this lens is compatible for infrared photography on your camera body.<br /><br />The Canon EF 28-135mm includes a 1 Year US Warranty and the front & rear lens caps.  The [[ASIN:B000Q6NSAM EW-78BII hood]] and [[ASIN:B00014K2W6 LP1116 soft lens pouch]] is sold separately.  Depending on your set-up, the case may not be that important, but get the hood as it will decrease lens flare and increase metering accuracy.  If you use filters, Canon recommends against stacking.<br /><br />As I add new lenses to my collection, this lens will probably be sold.  I don't see myself selling this lens in the next couple of years though.  Depending on what subject I am shooting, I get heavy use of this lens.

B00004RYZT|5.0|I love Rammstein and their live shows are hands down the best ever, even better than KISS. The music is the best and their stage presence is uncerpast. Buy it if you want to see how a real concert really is.
B000BMSTMS|5.0|Pop the CD in and press \\"Play\\" - you'll be amazed with the first 60 seconds of the introduction of Korn's new \\"See You On The Other Side\\" album. This album, besides refining the band, after going through a very rough time after loosing one of it's pioneer members, it shows a musical innovation between each song in this album....something you've never heard from Korn before. And who says innovation is not a good thing? Can be risky, but also rewarding if the right move is played. The album starts with a song with a very funky, industrial sound, a sound that is new for Korn. The track, \\"Twisted Transister\\" (first single) really outlines the above description Very well.  <br /> <br />In this album, you will find true feelings, a magnified sentiment towards our current social experiences, which include politics (also a track name), sex, and religion. I like a band that expresses truth and original feelings through a song.Korn have done it before, and they've done it again with this album. Korn is one of the very very few bands that we currently have that really mean something, because they play real music, with real feelings behind the music. What a great way to get back on the road with this album, on the path of what they do best: Music. Songs like \\"Politics,\\"\\"Hypocrites,\\"\\"10 Or A 2-Way,\\" and \\"Love Song\\" are definitely the introduction of this new  <br />'electro-industrial' sound Korn adopted in this album. Jonathan Davis unveils his vocals/lyrics as bold and affirmative in each of these songs, giving also a wide open space to the drumming and harsh, sometimes funky guitar riffs that James \\"Munky\\" Shaffer abruptly throws in several songs. The guitar work is remarkable, considering that Munky, for the first time, did all the guitar work himself! Speaking about guitars, what a great treat for us guitar lovers and admirers of this band with track \\"Open Up.\\" Not only did it give us a new dimension of what Korn can do musically, but also, for the first time, an exquisiteacustic guitar is heard, followed by always well-received bag pipes, single drumming and scab. Amazing!  <br /> <br />\\"Souvenir,\\"\\"Coming Undone,\\"\\"Liar\\"\\"For No One,\\" (song where Fieldy stands out more with his well recognized bass slapping)  <br />and \\"Eaten Up Inside\\" (bonus from the Deluxe CD Edition, which you should buy, and where David's drum work is absolute killer!) are tracks that remind us why Korn are the band that they are now. A band that keeps a real, unique sound and, regardless of any new added sounds to their work, they keep the Korn touch that has added this band in our music history books as a 'one and only' in their genre. I am pleased with this new album, the songs are so original and different from one another, it makes it difficult to select 'one' favorite one. Get this album, I fully recommend this album, you'll be surprised of the outstanding job Korn has done. To close, the band treated us(sentimental freaks) with \\"Tearjerker\\" a very mellow, inner-feeling melody that surprised everyone. Jonathan's voice is, unexpectedly, making me release a melancholic sigh, followed with chills! Amazing work, I can't say how much I love this album. Korn at its finest, indeed!
B0000057C5|5.0|This is one of my favorite bands and albums. It's got great songs like Engel, Du Hast, and Sehnsucht. My favorite it Eifersucht. Get this if you like Rammstein or heavy industrial.
B000BM6AVA|1.0|Hypnotize is just like ever other SOAD album - Pointless songs, with horrible musicianship. If you want to listen to some good music, go pick up a Slipknot album, something by Soilwork, In Flames, Mnemic, Lamb of God, Gizmachi, or Illdisposed.
B000003RCY|5.0|I love this album from start to finish. Every song id good to holy crap great. I personally love tracks 1,2,3,4,6,and 10 the most. Even the softer Seeman is awesume. It is the perfect blend of electronic and metal. Buy this.
B00006690G|5.0|Eminem gets better and better with each album.  Even though \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\" is my personal favorite of his albums, I love this one too, because Eminem shows so much more maturity here.  And by that, I mean he completely loses the Slim Shady character (except on the frst single \\"Without Me\\") and shows his serious side on every song.  Every track has meaning and the lyrics are so deep, it just goes to show why Eminem is respected so much in hip-hop.  If you don't have this album yet, definitely add it to your collection.
B00005AAFS|5.0|I LOVE RAMMSTEIN and I love this CD. My favorite songs are Links 2,3,4, Ich Will, Zwitter and Adios. If you like Rammstein or Hard rock check this out.
B00004T9UF|5.0|\\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\" is Eminem's second album and, in my opinion, his best ever.  This album is much more serious than \\"The Slim Shady LP\\"; the songs are much darker and angry.  Eminem has something to say on each and every track of this album, and the whole thing is perfect from beginning to end.  There are only a few CDs I own which I can listen to from beginning to end, and this is one of them.  For me, it never gets played out either.  I've listened to this album countless times and I'm not sick of it at all.  It's just amazing.  Don't hesitate to buy it!
055380457X|5.0|Vise and Malseed have done a wonderful job telling the tale of Sergey Brin, Larry Page, and how they created Google - arguably one of the greatest accomplishments of the internet-age.  I was pleasantly surprised that, given the topic, this book is not at all technical; anyone capable of typing [...] can easily follow along and will be interested.  For this reason I think the book makes a great gift.  Everybody uses Google! There are loads of interesting facts and useful bits of knowledge - even a fried chicken recipe by Google's star-chef (which I've eaten and it is FANTASTIC).  Finally, this book is inspirational to the small-business owner, student, or dreamer looking to blaze his/her own path of success.  Happy reading.
B000BMSTMS|5.0|This cd is one of the best yet!  After you listen to the whole cd, you can really tell how they've matured and have adopted a new sound.  Brian \\"head\\" obviously was not who held the band together because this cd proves that he clearly is not the inspiration for creating new sounds and is no longer needed.  There are so many new sounds in this cd its hard to even recognize what it is, but one sound that is recognizable is the bagpipes, played by lead singer Jonathan Davis.  This amazing talent has been with us since day one and I'm very happy to see that it is still with us today.  Overall, this is Korn at their best and I feel that the best is yet to come!!!
B000BKDOCA|1.0|This is a horrible horrible dance cd. The mixes are not even good enough to play in a club. I am a big fan of Miss Spears but lately she is just a big mess.  She needs to dump the loser husband of hers and get back to makin some music. And if she isnt gonna do that, at least release a remix cd with some good mixes. THANK GOD i didnt buy this. I would have died!!!
B00004XQP4|5.0|I love this album. It is highly underestimated and it is still incredible. I'll give you a play by play: <br /> <br />Warning 4/5- I love this song. A really great acoustic song and a great opener for a great cd. <br /> <br />Blood, Sex and Booze 5/5- Weird. About being whipped and stuff. Really good. <br /> <br />Church on Sunday 4/5- I like this song because it is about making up for bad things that have happened in a realationship and is a really cool song! <br /> <br />Fashion Victim 4/5- About today's latest fashions and what people will do to get in the latest fashion. Really true and that is what makes this a great song. <br /> <br />Castaway 5/5- I love this song. It is upbeat and really cool. <br /> <br />Misery 5/5- When I first heard this song, I thought it was misery. But now, it is my favorite song on the whole cd. Kind of like a godfatherish song. Incredible. <br /> <br />Deatbeat Holiday 5/5- I love this song.  <br /> <br />Hold On 4/5- My least favorite song on the album, but still fun to play! <br /> <br />Jackass 5/5- Second favorite song. Really cool. <br /> <br />Waiting 4/5- Most underated single by Green Day. <br /> <br />Minority 5/5- I love the intro/outro guitar in this song and this is also the song that you may notice a little bit of Green Day going political. <br /> <br />Macy's Day Parade 5/5- I love this song and it is a nice closer to on of the best Green Day cds ever! <br /> <br />All in all, a great record to listen to and is highly recommended. Also, check out my review on American Idiot.
0553801503|4.0|As many reviewers have stated (but many more have ignored), this was a great book. The writing is excellent, and the set-up is masterly. All of the different elements of the plot are coming together, promising a collision greater than any we've seen in the previous three books. Whatever happens next (or at least, after Dance of Dragons), is going to be something to read. <br /> <br />But there's realy no avoiding it- although Martin's ability has only improved, it was unavoidable that this book would not carry the suspense and action that Martin's readers are so accostomed to. The point of Feast for Crows was really to tie up some of the loose ends of the last book, to let us know what's been changing in the character's lives between the war that was and the war to come, while setting up the players and the stakes for the next conflict. 700 pages of a lull in the story (even a lull that involves as many new characters and new plots as this one) is simply not going to hold up next to three books of action, plots, and mysteries that do come to fruition.  <br /> <br />But Martin didn't really have a choice, did he? Technically, he could have begun the next installment a few years later, and brought us up to date with the happenings of the characters in the first few chapters. Most of his fans would have complained then, too, but more rightly so. Instead, Martin chose to give his fans what they deserve for reading several thousand page books just to follow his story. He trusts us to stay on board while he tells a few seperate stories and sets up a few new ones, and gives us the opportunity to get to see the reasons and flaws and psycology behind the decisions that the characters make, instead of just the events themselves. <br /> <br />Of course, I prefer the story when all the characters are there, and their many different stories are slowly woven together as the plot advances, and used to give the readers new revelations and open new mysteries. I hope that the books after Dance of Dragons won't be split apart like this, and I am not sure if Dance of Dragons will have more plot, or if it will be similar to this book. <br /> <br />But this was an excellent novel, and while not as fast paced as the others, it does offer many opportunities to really examine the characters. The end of the book promises a lot of excitement in the next few books.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This is my favorite cd and I'm on my second copy.I love it and it never gets old. I'll give you my play by play. <br />     American Idiot 4/5- Great opener and very political, a big screw you for Bush. <br />     Jesus of Suburbia 4/5- People say this is the best song, but disagree because Homecoming is better. <br />     Holiday 5/5- Always been one of my favorites. <br />     Boulevard Of Broken Dreams 4/5- The radio overplays it and it gets sickening, but it is still Green Day and so that makes it a good song. <br />     Are We The Waiting 4/5- Really good, but there are others that are better. <br />     St. Jimmy 4/5- Awesome and blood pumping. A great song to work out to. <br />     Give Me Novacaine 4/5- Really good solo. Really good song. <br />     She's A Rebel 4/5- Repetive, but is still a good song. <br />     Extraordinary Girl 4/5- It will grow on you! <br />     Letterbomb 5/5- From Letterbomb until the end is where it gets good. It's incredible. <br />     Wake Me Up When September Ends 5/5- Awesome and emotional to some people. <br />     Homecoming 10/5- My favorite song on the cd. Better than Jesus of Suburbia. <br />     Whatsername 5/5- I love this song and it is a great closer to the cd. <br />   <br />     All in all, this cd is worth buying and I can't wait until Green Day's next recorded cd comes out. I recomend 1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours, Kerplunk, Dookie, Insomniac, Nimrod, Warning, International Superhits!, Shenanigans, and Bullet in a Bible. That's all. You should really listen to them all because they are so awesome. Peace out!
B000006NPY|5.0|This is not the lightest album the Pumpkins ever made; it's by far the heaviest.  It's like wading through a black lagoon and singing to yourself so that you won't fall asleep and sink under the water.
0553801503|1.0|...by any stretch of the imagination.<br /><br />Martin should be ashamed of himself for this. When there are such long waits involved, you don't put out a piece of drivel like this. I really think he has just lost his way on this series. There have been many comparisons to Robert Jordan in these reviews and they are all apt. He's just milking this.<br /><br />I mean why were we forced to wait so long for new book when he chose to waste valuable time with those completely unnecessary Hedge Knight stories? Aaargh. This is really discgraceful. I hate to see comments like \\"better than 85% of the other garbage out there!\\", because these people act like I should feel privileged to read this nonsense. I don't, I feel offended. Jordan got me once, and now Martin got me once -no more. From now on it's straight to the library for this series, if i continue it at all...I'm so disgusted.<br /><br />I'm just not certain how he felt that this was at all acceptable to do to the readers? And to all the reviewers who put nonsense like \\"this is act2, scene 1\\" or some other tripe to that effect, -when you see a play you can at least know that you are seeing the final act that same evening. With these books it is years before you see the end or even the resolution to various subplots. That's why it is vital that each installment have some feeling of satisfactory development or closure for SOME PART of the story. When I turn the page and read an actual APOLOGY/EXPLANATION for the book by the author...that lets me know that he KNEW he screwed up, that this was not going to be acceptable to most people.<br /><br />To those who may buy this, please don't.<br /><br />It's not worth your money. It's certainly not worth your time. You are literally missing NOTHING of the story if you don't read this. You won't be any better off than you were at the end of Storm of Swords. Martin does not deserve to be paid for this. He hasn't done his job. At best, just get it from the library or from someone else like me who was dumb enough to trust Martin and buy the damn thing at release time.rom someone else like me who was dumb enough to trust Martin and buy the damn thing at release time.
0876855575|5.0|I've only read two Bukowski books, this and Post Office. After Post Office I was impressed, because Bukowski revealed some v. interesting, funny stories about his job (in ways that todays \\"Waiting\\" and other career novels/movies do) and the short chapters made it an easy read. However, after looking up on Amazon what I should read next - it was obvious - Ham on Rye.  <br />It's the book that Holden Caulfield may have written if he had written an autobiography at the age of 50. The way he writes is shooting from the hip - no crap, just as he sees it; even if it means he becomes humiliating in the process. It also makes you realise why Bukoswki was such a bittered and twisted man - and why he turned to drink.  <br />Ham on Rye chronicles \\"Bukoswki\\" or, his alter-ego Henry Chinaski, through his first memories, living with an abusive father, through school, where he is an outsider, and into the world of employment - where he see glimpses of Post Office and what is yet to come for Chinaski. It ends when he is in his early twenties.  <br />If you are interested in how artists find their passion, how human beings can be so cruel, how we are our childhoods - then you will love this book. If you have ever felt alone, and wondered if anyone in the world really cares - then this books for you. - Just a warning, Bukoswki isn't an optimist - the exact opposite, some times you may cringe with how depressing he is. But that is why he was such a inovative writer, just like Salinger before him; he didn't believe in hiding his readers from the big bad scary world - he introduced them to it.
B0000009S3|5.0|Though he's better known as an extraordinary satirist, Zappa was also a guitar virtuoso and a briliant composer.<br />Let's face it, Frank Zappa's so-called \\"arty\\" contemporaries couldn't match Zappa. I mean, was Pink Floyd making use of countermelodies? Could ELP ever ditc the pretention and come up with a melody that will stick with you for days? Did the Beatles (or Led Zeppelin, for that matter) have enough talent to keep a group jam going for seventeen minutes? And were any of these groups as wonderfully eccentric as Zappa? No, no, no, and no.<br />Zappa couldn't have picked a better way to open this album than with Peaches En Regallia, an extremely innovative instrumental that will stick with you for the rest of your life. It never, ever gets old. Trust me. Believe it or not, his guitar takes a backseat to Mr. Ian Underwood's sax, clarinet and keyboard. Then we have Willie the Pimp. At first, it sounds like Zappa-by-numbers, with some sleazy lyrics from Captain Beefheart. But then Frank takes over on guitar, delivering a jaw-dropping seven minute solo. Brilliance. Thirdly is another group jam, Son of Mr. Green Genes, though with its' similar melody and feel it could have very well been called Son of Peaches En Regallia. As we'd expect, it's a highlight, with Zappa contributing a great melody and better guitar. I don't really have much to say about Little Umbrellas, which is fun but forgettable...<br />...especially compared to The Gumbo Variations, a seventeen-minute group jam that proves just what Zappa's group was capable of. Other bands can't keep a jam going for half this length - not even Santana. But Frank Zappa, Ian Underwood and violinist Sugarcane Harris actually sound like a jazz group, not a garage band playing as long as possible. It's awesome. Sadly, the closer (It Must Be a Camel) is weak.<br />So, there you have it. Good jazz from a famed rock musician. Yes, that is possible.
0671042858|3.0|I haven't read a Stephen King novel for awhile.  I liked this story and it was well written, but just not what I expected for the King of Horror.  I figured out what the thing wathing Trisha was.  I guess you could say this was a predictable story.
B00005NTJM|4.0|You'd never believe it, but Jethro Tull used to be a blues band. So before they were singing about Aqualung, the Minstrel in the Gallery, and Ray Lomas, they were playing the blues. As it turns out, they were a pretty good blues band, though this definetly can't be compared with Aqualung, Thick as a Brick, Minstrel in the Gallery, etc.<br /><br />Okay, we've got a good opener with the hangover-song My Sunday Feeling, and a couple nice original blueses, with Someday the Sun Won't Shine For You (Great title!) and Beggar's Farm. Then there's the album's best song and hit, Song For Jeffrey, delivered in Ian's bluesy voice (too bad he hasn't used it since Stand Up, I really like it!)<br /><br />So what's wrong with this album? Well...it contains four of the flat-out WORST songs ever to appear on a Tull album. First, there's the resident endless boring instrumental known as Serenade to a Cuckoo. After that, another poor instrumental - Dharma For One (the ten-minute version on the outtakes album is good, though). It's Breaking Me Up...Zzzzzzzzz...Finally, Round. Awful. Another little issue I have with this album is that the flute playing isn't up to Anderson's usual standard, but that can be forgiven. After all, he had only learned how to play the flute recently. Though it's not their best album, it's worth seeking out. But not before you've lapped up every last bit of Aqualung, Thick As a Brick, Minstrel in the Gallery, A Passion Play and Benefit.
B0007QJ1N4|5.0|Like so many, i thought that Nick's departure from QOTSA would change the sound of the band to worse. And i must say that my first opinion of \\"Little sister\\" pointed in that direction. What a mistake i made. This album is a sort of fine blend, made from the hallucinogenic \\"Rated R\\" and the acid \\"Songs for the deaf\\", in order to create 15 great tunes (\\"Broken box\\" is, to me, one of the best QOTSA songs ever) that take some time to get used to (especially \\"Someone's in the wolf\\", which turns out to be another great song). But aren't those the ones that stick more time in your head? Once more, the feeling of having a good time doing this album is present and you always find a bunch of different people recording with QOTSA. They're fertile and they fertilize. Songs like \\"Everybody knows you're insane\\", with a calm beggining and a touch of insanity on the verse and until the end, \\"Like a drug\\" with it's mexican flavour, \\"Medication\\" that sounds like a quick shot of adrenaline make this a record that shows that QOTSA are still alive because they're much more than the sum of it's parts. A final note for Joey Castillo, who came and filled Dave Grohl's shoes in the difficult task of playing drums with rage and perfection. He does it in his own way, and what a way!! A must have for the fans, a good rock album for everyone else.
B00000DGXN|5.0|The quality of the music is fantastic which is what you would expect from these jazz masters.  It is a shame that the quality of the recording is not up to the standard, especially chick's piano which is incredible but the poor quality has reduced the enjoyment.  I really cannot understand how the quality of recording is not up to the normal standards as these musicians should not accept anything less.
B00004TH6O|5.0|Yes, this is, without a doubt the best QOTSA album. Breaking away from the previous album which was quite boring ( almost every song sounds the same ) , Rated R has an unique appeal to it. Starting off with \\"Feel good hit of the summer\\" and it's simple but heart felt message (someone that spends 2m43s singing \\"Nicotine, valium, vicodin, marijuana, ecstasy and alcohol, c-c-c-c-c-cocaine\\" really likes it!!), passing through great songs like \\"Monsters in the parasol\\", \\"Leg of lamb\\", \\"Auto pilot\\" and so on, you get a sense that although the core of the band lies in Josh Homme and Nick Oliveri, QOTSA is nothing but a bunch of friends gathered around to play great music and share experiences and sensibilities. Unlike \\"Songs for the deaf\\" and it's visceral appeal, \\"Rated R\\" has more of hallucinogenic side to it and that makes it a great trip. Excellent record, worthy of every cent. A must have and a must hear, over and over. And then again.
B0006M4SO6|3.0|I respect Pat Metheney and I enjoy his music, however, lately the quality of music has become tiresome and nothing special.  The tunes do not seem to have a melody or a structure and they seem to be improvising throughout the CD.  There are no special moments or special melodies that will haunt you.  I have listened to this CD three times and I am not excited enough to listen to it again. <br />
B00006F83Y|5.0|After the excellent and eccletic \\"Rated R\\", QOTSA showed that it is possible to give birth to a rock album without having any need to mix rap and metal and scratches and that kind of s*** that stinks the airwaves nowadays with all the Limps and the Linkins and all their sort. It is so amazingly visceral that it is impossible not to be swept off your feet. Just to hear Dave Grohl's drums makes me go bananas. Here's a guy who should never have left his daytime job. The beggining of \\"A song for the dead\\" is simply amazing. Songs like \\"You think i ain't worth...\\" and \\"First it giveth\\" are staight to the core. No time to look back here. Just fasten your seatbelt and enjoy the ride, 'cause you're in for a big one!
B000BVEKO0|5.0|KOrn's latest album See You on the Other Side is a masterpiece!! <br /> <br />Korn has reinvented themselves with their latest album.  The mix of metal and industrial sounds is fresh and new. <br /> <br />Twisted Transistor is the first single...sure to be followed by others.   <br /> <br />To me all the tracks are aweosme some of my favs are hypocrites, coming undone, love song, souvenir of sadness, throw me away, liar and tearjerker where Jonathan Davis's voice is so clear and melodic a wonder step for him showing his range.  <br /> <br />Be sure to include this CD the Deluxe Edition for your korn collection...you will be sure to be playing this one for a while.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|The luxury of seeing mayor figures of the rock history. Eric like always shows another spectacular moments of the slow hand style. Ginger make us feel that he, charly watts and John Bonham are the best of all the time but how ever Jack Bruce in this occasion is my favorite, such a voice and his bass notes are still powerfull. we hope to see as soon as possible the madison square garden sessions available on dvd.

B000AYEL1A|2.0|When Streisand is doing epic ballads she is fine.She is also one of the original divas,and it comes with an ego the size of an elephant.She is great with the broadway thing,but occaisionally takes on an ego-project that doesn't match her abilities or talents.Her level of fantasy and self infatuation sometimes put me in awe.However,that's part of the fun of movie-stars!<br /><br />This pseudo rock(and I do mean pseudo!) revival of \\"A star is born\\" finds Streisand over her head in rock music that would have suited, the baudy and exciting, modern Cher,Tina Turner orGrace Slick, (Cher was a contender for this part in the mid-seventies.)<br />Thinly veiled,this rock drama is a story of a Joplin-esque diva who surpasses her wayward beau (Kristofferson). Not horrible, I may add but a miss none- the less.Most of the soundtrack has not fared too well.A matter of fact it is just plain corny!<br />The two previous outings of this classic story ring truer,and let me add that the Garland version is unbeatable.Streisand never seems vulnerable.She seems like she exists in an invented world,that is for spoiled rock divas!<br />Her(Streisand) self penned song \\"Evergreen \\" is mor nice,but out of context with her so-called rock diva personna.It is a huge hit for the diva though,and I believe won her a grammy!<br />Streisand in bubble-bath,with dangly painted nails is hysterical!She is the archetypal capitalist democrat!<br />It is interesting from it's mid seventies setting,and her pairing with a gruff country star(Kristofferson),mirrors her penchant for pretty boy anglos to co-star with.(Robert Redford,Ryan McNeal,Nick Nolte etc)
B000BMSTMS|5.0|My name is Alvin, KoRn street team name is davesilvera, and i have been a KoRn fan for years and years. I have been waiting for this album to come out for a long time and was more than satisfied when i actually bought it. Here is my song - by - song review of the album.  <br /> <br />1. Twisted Transistor - A bit poppy but i can see why they chose it as a single. It is really good to listen to when just chilling. The guitaring is very unique and the beat is awesome. Also, the vocals are great on this song.  <br /> <br />2. Politics - A very odd and original song. It has heavy doom-metalish guitaring for the verses, and the chorus/pre-chorus are just straight out KoRn. This song is about how corrupt sex, organized religion, and politics have become, and it is a very powerful song.  <br /> <br />3. Hypocrites - This song starts out very very indsutrial-like, with a hint of Rage Against the Machine, but is still straight up heavy-riffed KoRn. Very loud and powerful guitars with a great beat. This song seems to be, lyrically, about how in church you are taught not to be greedy while your pastors are stealing cash from the church themselves. This song is very pleasable to the ear though, especially during the verses when munky plays an octave higher than the rest of the riff and jon starts sounding like something you would expect in a religious musical. Also, Munky screaming \\" Hypocrites \\" sounds great.  <br /> <br />4. Souvenir - Starts out with a heavy riff. Everything is mixxed just about right. Every aspect of this song is just straight-out KoRn, and this is probably the song that would fit the best on a previous KoRn album, has a very traditional KoRn feel.  <br /> <br />5. 10 or a 2-way - A fairly odd song, but very cool. Has a great drum intro. Very heavy riffage again, and great use of effects in it. One of the most unique tracks on this entire album. It even has a slight manson-esque feel to it.  <br /> <br />6. Throw Me Away - Another very unique track. after 8measures of drums jon starts out by saying \\" flesh, wound, flesh, wound, with medication it will fade \\", so right from the start you know you are stepping into a new KoRn territory. The song is fairly slow though, but it has some really heavy parts in it.  <br /> <br />7. Love Song - It starts out with a nice munky riff with some cool effects on it, has great synth work in this song rtight from the begining, again very manson-esque. The vocals are very angry, and this is a very refreshing song to listen to.  <br /> <br />8. This song starts out with some tradition KoRn slap bass and awesome drum beats. You gotta hand it to fieldy and david for this track. When munky kicks in everything just gets better though. This song sounds like it should be the next single, if hypocrites or politics are not. This one seems fairly depressing and angry, which is exactly what KoRn are famous for ( jokes ).  <br /> <br />9. Coming Undone - Starts out with a nice heavy, extremely distorted, riff. This is a fairly traditional sound song for KoRn though guitar-wise, but david's drumming sounds completely different from anything else he has ever done for the band before. The song is all-around cool, with a good mixture of new KoRn and old KoRn in it.  <br /> <br />10. Getting Off - It starts out with a heavy riff again by Munky with some cool effects in the background. The chorus sounds familiar though. Jon sings ' getting off, im getting off, keep getting off, keep getting off, im getting off, im getting off to you \\" and any hardcore KoRn fan will be remind of the song sean olson where jon screams \\" im cumming im cumming im cumming on you  \\". The vocals are superb on this track though. They are fit the song so tightly that it is a wonder about how jon does this stuff.  <br /> <br />11. Liar - Another traditional KoRn riff for the intro... Until the effects kick in. This song is obviously about... Head. The song is heavy through and through, and very angry.  <br /> <br />12. For No one- This song is very empowering but strange. It starts out heavy and fast, chills out for a few moments, and kicks back in and out again. The chorus is very heavy guitar-wise and jd dragsd the vocals on for, which does fit the song. This song also has great bass and percussion in it.  <br /> <br />Seen It All - Starts out slow, very slow, with a siren-like sound ( most likely an armonica ). This song is definitely their most unique song ever, with multiple instruments in it ranging from the armonica to bagpipes. This song doesnt have a manson-esque feel or a NIN-esque feel, but it sounds like this is a song that would inspire an industrial band. Everything from the vocals to the instruments are different from anything else KoRn has ever done. The outro is very long and instrumental, but fits the song well.  <br /> <br />14. Tearjerker - The title is self-explanatory. It is a great, slow, sad song. What else is there to say?  <br /> <br />I definitely suggest buying this album if you like KoRn, Industrial, Manson, System of a Down, or Alternative Metal at all. If i was allowed to i would give this album a 10 out of 5 stars, but sadly it doesnt let you.
B000B8QEZG|1.0|When Madonna(her arrogance) failed to capture fans with her last cd,pretending to forge a new happening sound with bohemian beret,she took the obvious route to success in this over-hyped  return to disco cd.<br />Nothing is innovative here.We find the same old disco- production run cd, reminding us of her roots in superficial  disco pop.<br />Her singing has never been strong. She is an over-rated mediocre singer.Come to think of it,her material always was production based.The voice always boring and thin, helped by electronica.<br /><br />Her acting is worse.The modern world of materialism and banality created her .(material girl). She has masqueraded as Dietrich Monroe and che Guevera,eager to distract us from her empty shell.<br />Her videos from the 80's are her pinnacle.They were her greatest achievement.However, this cd shows she has to go backward to get attention,and hype.<br />Kabbalah and fish-nets don't mix.<br />Cher doesn't have to worry.
B000BMSTMS|5.0|As with everyone I was skeptical to see what they could do with out Head, but after hearing this CD I can say that they compensated very well, this is not the traditional Korn which is a good thing. Everyone that doesnt like this CD is the people that think bands should not change and should always be the same style, sound and lineup. Well guess what bands grow up and mature and move in different directions with this CD Korn gets to let it all hang out and really let their creative juices flow with no limitations and the result is a dark, heavy, industrial style album but at the same time very melodic in parts. No some of this CD isnt heavy in the traditional sense but more of dark songs with beats and guitars that groove that leave you torn between either dancing or moshing. Stand out tracks include: \\"Throw me away\\"- a more melodic dark song with a powerful chorus. \\"open up\\" the rhythm section on this song with fieldy bringing back a little bit of his percussive bass that we know and love. \\"Hypocrites\\" time signature keeps it grooving yet stays hard. \\"For no one\\" and \\"10 or 2-way\\"
0300108834|5.0|At the time this book was written (early 20th century), very few Westerners were properly informed about Asian and Middle Eastern history. Reading this book to one's child is an excellent opportunity to point that out and to ask him/her the question: what good is a well-written history book, if some of the information is wrong? Your child will surprise you with the creativity of his/her answer.    No book or system of education gets all the facts straight (news flash to American elementary school teachers -- Columbus did NOT sail west to prove the world is round! People already knew that).     You can't shelter your child from disinformation but you can teach her/him to think critically and to look for the truth her/himself. When the child is older, you can talk about primary sources and other tools good historians use to increase the accuracy of their work.    There's no law saying you have to read this book to your child in its entirety. You can be honest and say that as wonderful as the book is, people now know that the parts on the East are incorrect so you'll be skipping those chapters.    The introduction to the Italian Renaissance alone is worth the price of the book. Why entirely eschew a work that could get your young one excited about the history of the world?
B000BMSTMS|5.0|Believe it or not, Korn has made another amazing album to add to your collection. Korn has been around for over a decade, and have changed so much over the years, but any Korn fan will love the new sound. Remarkable lyrics, with a spine chilling industrial sound, See You On The Other Side proves that Korn doesn't need their X-guitarist Brian Welch to make a kick ass album. This album is a must have for any TRUE Korn fan!
B00005JO04|3.0|In Stephan Gaghan's screenplay for \\"Traffic\\" the prize was drugs, in \\"Syriana\\" everyone is after oil. The characters are the same only the names have changed. These people are cunning and ruthless. They care about no one but themselves.<br /><br /> The same day this movie came out I read an article in the New York Times stating \\" Americans do not trust business or the people who run it.\\" \\"Syriana\\" will not help their cause.<br /><br /> The movie is a complicated one. We follow a group of people, some who know each other, some who don't, who all seems to affect the other's life. This is the kind of movie you should know nothing  about. Don't worry about the plot, don't read the critics. In fact, I'd prefer you don't read this until you've seen the movie. To give you the slightest bit of information is to give away too much. The film should catch you by surprise and unfold before your eyes. That is the only real way to come to care about any of these characters.<br /><br /> As with \\"Good Night, And Good Luck\\" (another film I recommend you see) some people will accuse this movie of being Liberal. With \\"Good Night\\" I was willing to let the remark slide but this time I'm going to have to fight back against the Conservative Elite. \\"Syriana\\" is not offering left-wing talking points, nor is it offering right-wing. The movie doesn't take sides. As with the film \\"Traffic\\" (which I always felt deserved the Oscar over \\"Gladiator\\") both films look at a problem and try to deal with it in the most realistic way possible but never offer a solution. To offer a solution means the problem will go away, both films deal with topics so big there are no easy solutions.<br /><br /> \\"Syriana\\" opens in time for the big Oscar campaigns, the time when Hollywood saves its good movies. I could definitely see a few Oscar nominations coming this film's way. It would please me greatly if Christopher Plumber were to receive an Oscar nomination for \\"Best Supporting Actor\\" and Gaghan for \\"Best Screenplay\\".<br /><br /> And what about George Clooney? This seems to be his year. First writing and directing the exceptional \\"Good Night, And Good Luck\\" and now giving quite a powerful performance here. Clooney has managed to turn me into a fan.<br /><br /> But there are some things about this film I didn't like. I didn't care for the editing. I found a few shots unnecessary and at times disliked the cinematography. I feel the biggest downfall of the film though is we never get to really understand these people. Their concerns are never our concerns. Gaghan was able to accomplish this in \\"Traffic\\" and other emsemble films released this year also succeeding in doing so, \\"Crash\\" for instance, but \\"Syriana\\" takes on so much, many times the viewer feels overwhelmed. We feel we are missing something. We are playing a game of catch up and this becomes distracting.<br /><br /> Still despite everything \\"Syriana\\" is nicely crafted, expertly directed and well acted. Amanda Peet gives her best performance. I realize going over her credits that's not saying much, but it doesn't make the statement any less true. Some moments in this film are truly great. They are highly emotional and real. And as for Gaghan himself this is a notch above his previous film \\"Abandon\\" but a step beneath \\"Traffic\\", still it shows a great deal of promise for things to come. Which is more than we can say about some of the characters in this movie.<br /><br /> Bottom-line: Ambitious, grand-scale film that has some truly wonderful moments. The cast has moments where they shine but the film is too complex to really follow. There is no real understanding of these people still the movie is worth your time.Clooney?

B000BVEKO0|5.0|With a new line up new label Virgin and a new sound, Korn's 7th studio album See You On The Other Side is some what of a new begining for the quartet. Kicking the album off with the radio friendly, upbeat rocker \\"Twisted Transister\\" is a great way to get your blood flowing and your anticipation for the upcoming tracks sky high. Tracks like \\"Politics\\", \\"Hypocrites\\" is a sure way for vocalist Jonathan Davis to get things off his chest about todays society, of course with heavy riffs from guitarist James \\"Munky\\" Shafer, and a great mix of beats with bassist Fieldy and drummer David Silveria. Track 9 \\"Coming Undone\\" has a HEAVY drumbeat and kinda of a \\"clap\\" sound to it. A really great groove song as most songs on this album have. Then it ends with \\"TearJerker\\" with an into with a glass harmonica that gives an erie sound. Jonathan really shows off his vocal ability along with deep meaningful lyrics. As it gets soft a snare drum comes blasting in then followed by deep riffs. It really adds to the song and makes it yet...another sure classic Korn song. If you happen to get the Deluxe Edition. You are blessed with the first track \\"It's Me Again\\" which is a hard balls to the wall song. It also shows the great drummer by David Silveria with a nice blend of double bass drums. Following is \\"Eaten Up Inside\\" which is yet another straight hard rock song. With a great double bass drum part to put the icing on the cake. \\"Last Legal Drug (Le Petit Mort)\\" is another great song thats about the last legal drug....sex. A sure favorite for all Korn fans. Also on the second disc is 2 remixes of Twisted Transister. Also two videos, one of Twisted Transister live in Moscow, and Hypocrites live in Moscow. All in all this is a GREAT Korn album. It has a new sound that is sure to blow the socks off the old, and the new Korn fans. I Highly recommend getting this album ASAP and enjoying all that is KORN. 5 Star rating from me.
0385486804|3.0|This is not actually a book.  It's an article.  With a lot of extraneous stuff added - things about other young men cut short by nature; about the author himself. <br /> <br />It's an easy read, but don't confuse that with well written.  The story is interesting, but the author puts too much of his head and ideas in there. <br /> <br />Chris/Alex is interesting enough, but not the hero the author tries to make him. <br /> <br />
B000001F3C|4.0|'War' is a very good collection by U2.  This album is definitely focused on the Irish-British conflict and makes many powerful statements.<br /><br />The music is strong vocally and instrumentally.  The guitars and drums are a major force on this CD.<br /><br />There are two all time classics on this album - 'Sunday Bloody Sunday' and 'New Year's Day'.  The version of 'New Year's Day' on this album is quite a bit longer than the one on the 'The Best of 1980-1990' album.  I would recommend this album for that song alone.<br /><br />If you enjoy classic rock, this is definitely a good one to have.
B000BKJ78K|1.0|Let me explain: I got sick of waiting for Lucas to release the original trilogy on DVD a long time ago and I actually purchased a LaserDisc player and the so-called 'Original' Star Wars trilogy on laserdisc - only it's not the original Empire Strikes Back that I saw in the theater!!    THE MISSING SCENES FROM EMPIRE STRIKES BACK:  1 - The 'Bacta' scene with Luke in the tank and the medical droid was longer. Thre was a point where Luke was floating in the tank and you see this red goo/dye injected into the tank. Then they pull him out and Leia or 21B (the droid) says something like, 'The Bacta are growing well, the scars should be gone in a day or two...'    When I saw 'Empire' in the theater back in 1980 there was another scene I will never forget that I have NEVER seen since except on the earliest of (bootleg?)VHS copies.    2 - In the battle scene on Hoth in 'The Empire Strikes Back', right before General Veers is about to destroy the power generators, Hobby 'kamikazees' the walker with his snowspeeder. He lets out a blood curdling 'Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!!' on his way in. You see the snowspeeder coming in from General Veers perspective from inside the walker then you see the General - the expression on his face is priceless. The walker's head then explodes as the snowspeeder hits it. Another walker then destroys the power gens a little later. The power gen explosion is also different, it is a more pulled-back shot with full view of a nuclear mushroom cloud superimposed over what were the generators.    Also!  CUT SCENE/AUDIO #3  When the snowtroopers enter the base immediately following the battle, there are some scenes cut out of them rushing in to the command center and the audio has been changed to eliminate a PA announcement that says, 'Imperial troops have entered the base, Imperial troops have entered the base! (then Static as it is cut off presumably by the announcer being killed).    I give up.    It turns out that my local theater may have gotten a 'prescreener' version of the film!   I have purchased the 'Special Editions', the original laserdisc releases, and a bootleg DVD set from eBay and I STILL do not have the original trilogy unaltered. Now I am looking for a VHS with everything there...    Lucas, if you were trying to make me broke and insane - good job.
0553288105|5.0|Clearly one of the true masters of science fiction, nobody ever blended the science and the fiction as well and as harmoniously as Isaac Asimov did. Asimov's speculations, though wild and far-fetched, always had their roots firmly in proven science, and thus his work is speculative fiction at its best; at the same time, the drama and characters are as solid as the basic theories, and the two elements melt together perfectly to create truly great science fiction. 'The Gods Themselves', one of the best of Asimov's works that stand on their own and not as part of a series, is a fantastic example of this talent. The novel makes a wild hypothesis that entices fascinating moral and philosophical dilemmas, and tries to work these out, never for a minute ceasing to be an enticing and engaging work of fiction. <br /> <br />'The Gods Themselves' addresses the dilemma from three different angles through the telling of three entirely separate stories, taking place in very different locations - one on earth, one in a parallel universe, and one in a human colony on the moon. While the tales are separate, they intertwine in a fascinating fashion. The novel's biggest flaw is probably the fact that the last part is doubtlessly the weakest. Though it does an excellent and masterful job of describing a human society adapted to life on a different world, it often loses its dramatic focus in favor of those descriptions and in descriptions of sex and nudity that are sometimes necessary and sometimes superfluous. <br /> <br />Be that as it may - the second part, taking place in the so-called Para-Universe, a universe parallel to our own and inhibited by an entirely different species than ours - is so good that in itself it makes the novel one of Asimov's greatest masterpieces. Asimov manages to create an entirely convincing alien race - a three-sexed alien race, complete with mating and reproduction proceedings - with minimum visual description of the universe or its inhabitants. Asimov manages the impossible here - the entire chapter is told from the aliens' point of view, and therefore the rituals and lifestyles that aren't in any way similar to anything we know is given minimal description, the entirely alien ideas being considered obvious and clear; and yet the master manages to give us a perfect idea of the way these creatures behave and act, making the reader believe in them as true characters with feelings and motives, even sympathize with them. This is such a huge achievement that in itself it makes 'The God Themselves' one of the true great masterpieces of science fiction. For any fan of the genre, not to mention any fan of Asimov's, this is a unique and essential masterpiece.
B000063DIR|1.0|I can think of very few acts more despicable than this in the annals of rock music.  I hate Ozzy and his wife.  This outrage needs to be more widely known.  Sickening.  Needless to say, don't buy this reissue with rerecorded drums and bass.  The Osbournes' greed knows no limits.
B00000016K|4.0|cream is touring again, and doing many of these tunes, as in example at albert hall,,,,,,, in fact they are playing them better than the original riffs, and almost to a note  <br />clapton has progressed so far since 66, but many of his roots, and of such as muddy waters and willie dixon are  shown in his jamming,,, <br />jack bruce plays harp very well,,,, it will be interesting where they go after the current touring , in final notes , too bad felix pappalardi is not around to share in the fun times
B0000560X0|2.0|George Benson is without a doubt an incredible guitarist. He is a great singer and is an incredible entertainer in general. His skill is certainly shown through this performance. The track lineup is great, as is the backing band, creating a tight setting for George. Also, the implementation of Strings and Brass at various times (while unfortunately sometimes missing some kick) is good.  <br /> <br />These factors of live performance brought together would have seemingly created a great DVD-release performance that could have been watched and enjoyed many times over. But along with live performance comes the aspect of having an audience. One might presume that the kind of audience that would turn up at a GB concert would surely be relaxed and relatively subdued, appreciating his playing and listening to him because they are just as cool as he is. No? <br /> <br />Evidently not! Well, not in this case at least. There is only one reason why I will never watch this concert again, and that is the audience. I'm sure there was a great vibe in the hall that night, and therefore, one can understand the concept of getting up and dancing to the music. The only problem is that those dancing to this music are primarily annoying, over-confident middle-aged women who insist on getting in on the action. So much so that there is one woman who jumps up on the stage with George, trying to... \\"get into it\\" with him. It is truly embarrassing watching George try to deal with this bizarre incident involving a rude woman who presumed that she had the right to take the stage with him. The feeling of extreme discomfort demonstrated by his facial expression is almost unbearable to watch. I might have been able to deal with it if she hadn't stayed up there for such a seemingly long time. I seem to recall that she mysteriously disappeared off the stage at the cut of a shot (...security?). However, I do not want to varify this, as it would mean that I'd have to watch it again. I can understand the way the audience would have felt that night, and I can understand the the urge to dance to the music. But I do feel that the way in which some people took part was quite unnecessary.  <br /> <br />Overall, George performs extremely well, as do the other musicians seen and heard here, but I won't be watching it again until they release a version taken only from the cameras pointed on the stage.
B00000K3CM|2.0|Im not saying this is worse then \\"Home Alone 4\\" but I like Home Alone 1 & Home Alone 3 way over this movie. I love the acting by (Joe Pesci & Dainel Stern) thats just about it. Home Alone 1 is had a great story which Home Alone 2 it just was to off. \\"Kevin is a huge beatiful house brining the pain to Harry and Merv while 2 same thing but more ugly.
B00005B36H|5.0|Thanks a lot for putting me into killing mode.  For saying that Crimso (A favorite band of mine) or Dream Theatre (Some of the most horrendous trash available in music throughout mans history on earth) reaches higher in art than Lateralus is like saying that an education and a bunch of knowledge can enhance the beauty of art.  I've loved Lateralus since the day it came out and I will enjoy it as much as I did on first listen until the day I die.  Please, I don't want to tell you to die or antyhing similar, I'm too generous, but saying that Tool aren't good song writers when I've listened to Parabola an honestly literal HUNDREDS of times and it's more powerful and densely structured than ANYTHING in dump theatre, or ANYTHING else, I'm afraid my fist would eventually find you if you insisted on your point.  By way of comparison, Dream Theater is like an idiot next to an enormous man with a beard, and square pectorals, and a lightning javelin, and he's ten feet tall, and has all the wisdom of the universe and the knowledge required to incinerate entire nations with a glance, and he has voluminous robes, and a really tall hat and he's omnipotent, generally, and you have some idea of what Lateralus looks like.  Excuse me, but you're a regular Judas for saying the things you've said. <br /> <br />-P.S. I'm glad that you pointed out that you like Dream Theatre, this is perhaps the best demonstration of someones inabilty to appreciate the purpose of music.  Go play me 50 billion notes in 2 seconds, if it doesn't move me I'll call it chicanery. <br /> <br />-P.P.S. I'm sorry that you like King Crimson, this indicates that you're one of those technician types who looks at Fripp and says \\"Jesus, Fracture really was a peice of tricky guitaring!\\" but will never understand the purpose of Starless and Bible Black in art.  (Robert Fripp has frequently expressed his admiration for Tool, calling them equal to or greater than his own band, and maintains his freindship with them, AND toured with them in Crimso as OPENING act.) <br /> <br />-P.P.P.S. Thank you for mentioning Limp Bizkit and Metallica, you deserve my unrequited rage. <br /> <br />-P.P.P.P.S. You already have it for saying that The Mars Volta \\"isn't that great\\", which - coincidentally - makes nothing but perfect sense when bearing in mind that you have no sense of artistic worth in your body, and you're irreparably numb to real emotion or beauty. <br /> <br />And so, in closing:  Have fun with a mediocre life!
B0002OERI0|1.0|Alright. Let me start this off by saying this. Green Day, once a punk force to be reckoned with, has now gone and sold out big time. And really messed themselves up. I hate this album for several reasons. Don't get me wrong, I love the original punk of the 70's, the anarchism of the Pistols, and the politically-minded Clash. But this is an insult to those great groups. Take \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams,\\" the song that got 8-year olds into this band. It's got all the qualities of an emo song, and I wouldn't be surprised if Dashboard Confessional covers it sometime. And it's as far away from \\"God Save the Queen\\" or \\"White Riot\\" as it can be without being written poetry, for Petes Sake. And what really irks me is how it's gotten promoted to death by MTV and VH1. I really hate it when I see 9 or 10 year olds who claim to \\"love\\" Green Day, even though they probably couldn't name a song off of their debut, \\"1039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours.\\" Even today, I heard a young, probably 7 year old, girl requesting the aforementioned \\"Boulevard\\" on the pop radio station. And the polotics get me too. A lot of the kids who supposedly \\"love\\" American Idiot have republican parents, which kind of kills the idea. They probably don't get it, either. <br />   <br />So, in conclusion, please don't add fuel to the fire and buy this album because of what some brainwashed 10 year old who's never heard a Sex Pistols song says. Go listen to some Rage Against the Machine.
B000005S0E|5.0|i'll keep this quite simple. the top is the first album where the cure showcased the breadth of what they can do, what they had already done, and what was to come. it is one of those rare albums that remains brilliant from start to finish. this album is truly the cure's defining moment and definately the one to be owned by music lovers committed to building a cracker collection of recordings.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Wow. Let me start this review by saying this is one of the few \\"perfect albums\\" out there. It really is, and that's no overstatement. This, Radiohead's third, is a true masterpiece and will probably be ripped off for years to come, (COLDPLAY) even though some claim the music is inaccessible. I kept hearing the name of the group in conjunction with the Beatles, so I decided, \\"Why not try it out?\\" I first listened to Pablo Honey, which was pretty much standard Britpop. I have not had the pleasure of listening to The Bends, their sophomore album. But enough about me. Let's get into the music. \\"Airbag,\\" the opener, has one of the most dramatic opening riffs in recent memory. And add the almost cinematic sweeps of the rythm section, and you could listen to this song over and over. The next song, \\"Paranoid Android,\\" doesn't disappoint. It's a three-part story that could roughly be the life of a character from \\"Hitchhiker's guide to the Galaxy.\\" Defining moments are Jonny Greenwood's face-melting solos towards the middle and the end. Next come Subterranean Homesick Alien and Exit Music (For a Film). Both are highly interesting, while one is slow and loungesque, the other is chilling and haunting. The next two, Let Down and Karma Police, are \\"rockers\\" (though the first is somewhat slower) in the signature Radiohead style. Thom Yorke sounds superb on both  Then comes an interesting one. \\"Fitter Happier\\" is, in my eyes, the dividing line between the two \\"parts\\" (Although not a \\"true\\" concept album, OK Computer has qualities that make it such, but is not \\"divided\\" in two.) The spoken word song, which was made using a Mac's \\"Macintalk\\" setting, is basically a representation of the ideal \\"modern life,\\" a theme of the album. <br />   Electioneering kicks off the second half, a kind of wake-up call against the surreal imagery of \\"Fitter Happier\\" that could be sung from a politician or businessman's point of view. (It's Just Business!) Then comes the haunting \\"Climbing Up the Walls,\\" written by Thom Yorke as a result of his experiences working in a mental hospital. A truly creepy song. Then comes the beautiful \\"No Surprises,\\" which conflicts with the distubing \\"Walls.\\" It's impossibly simle, yet charming. The last two, \\"Lucky\\" and \\"The Tourist\\" are both slow, and share the theme of starting over again. And thus ends one of the great albums of our times, one that can be interpreted any which way you please.
0316168815|5.0|A most unusual story, told from heaven, from the prospective of a girl who left this far earth too soon, under the most brutal of circumstances. Both her observations of life moving on, and her description of what heaven is like, are very insightful, thought-provoking and life-affirming. Heart-breaking at times and heart-warming at others, this book is very special!
B000002ITW|4.0|I mean, who doesn't already have that song anyway?  That track's kind of a ripoff, and there is not nearly enough of Stills being heard, but \\"Black Queen\\" almost makes up for it.  I may be a little biased, because I don't find many things much finer than a live Neil Young letting it all out.  All in all, this is a pretty good album if you enjoy the live sound (which is certainly lacking in most of today's music).  If you're looking more for a refined, produced sound like you hear on the radio, stick with one of their great studio albums.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|First of all, I think that half of these reviews are Ridiculous! People are complaining that they spent all this money buying individual seasons (I myself included in that) when all of a sudden HBO comes out with a big fancy box set.  <br />Well DUH!  <br />Only every tv series out there where all seasons have been released, release a \\"box set.\\"  <br />That's not just a tv series thing either. Movies do it as well. Jurassic park, Nightmare on Elm Street, etc, etc. Box sets are the big thing now.  <br />HBO didn't rip anyone off. I agree about releasing the 6th season in two parts, I was bitter about that myself. But it was on tv the same way. They broke the last season up into two parts.  <br /> <br />Get over it. You love the show or you don't. No one is making you buy this!
B000BVEKO0|5.0|This album is amazing. Korn has grown so well. This is definitely one of my favorites because all the songs are so great.  My favorite songs are Throw Me Away, Coming Undone, and Eaten Up Inside. This album is a must have!
B0006IUDXA|4.0|MacGyver season 1 one revolutionized the idea of an \\"action hero.\\"  For once, the hero was able to triumph by out-thinking the bad guys.  The stories are imaginative, and the science is, almost always, accurate.  The only negative is that Macgyver does not use his intellect outside of day-to-day situations and as such his life is not as well managed.
0679423001|5.0|The first time I read Brideshead I thought it was only an alcholism story. Waugh did an incredible job of describing what it's like to love someone who is hooked on booze. Charles Ryder is best friends with Lord Sebastion Flyte, a golden young man who has everything but deststroys himself via the bottle. The scenes where Sebastion is happy and the scenes where he's drunk are intense and very realistic. The whole family is touched by his alcoholism and the whole family is hurt by it. Later Charles has a fairly dull romance with Sebastion's sister Julia but it serves to keep him involved in this intresting family so it's tolerable.  <br /> <br />Later, when I grew up I realized that Brideshead is also about religion, duty, and England. Which ever angle you choose to \\"come at\\" Brideshead doesn't matter. Evelyn Waugh, for all his faults was a dazzling writer and this is an unforgettable tale.
0525948023|5.0|There are few people who really know how to address an audience. And though I do not ordinarily  go for CD's of talks by authors,Eckhart Tolle always has so much substance to his talks. And, actually, I heard Tolle's talks before I read THE POWER OF NOW--which I continue to re-read every now and again. (and I never tire of that classic book!) This is a worthy and logical follow up--very well done and up to the high standard of this spiritual communicator.  <br /> <br />So recommend, but I also enjoyed M. WIlliamson's GIFT OF CHANGE and a lesser known work, FEARLESS: DOING EXTRAORDINARY THINGS... by L. Ulatowska. Good companions to this work.
B0000VAFO0|2.0|This movie is mostly an effects and popcorn driven thriller , much like van helsing, only it tries to be serious. <br />It's got a good solid premise, a war between supernaturals, which could be far more interesting than most movies where one supernatural wins out, but it never goes anywhere with it. <br />The script, the plot, etc...are all pretty boring and mediocre. The action is also disappointing , as you almost never see vampires and werewolves sparring with their powers, just using guns like regular henchmen. <br />I give it two stars out of generosity. <br />One for visual style--it's got a nicely dark, moody and gothic atmosphere and sets, good for setting mood. <br />And one for kate beckinsale in leather--always a nice addition.
B0008ISM40|5.0|If you have a nice surround sound setup, then I highly recommend this Dual Format. The 5.1 format really brings out the nuances in the music and adds a whole new dimension. Nine Inch Nails is particularly suited to this format since electronic effects float around the room. <br /> <br />With Teeth is one of those CDs that keeps growing on you. Powerful, catchy songs with driving beats. The songs are varied from the fast-paced You Know What You Are? to the dreamy Right Where It Belongs. Mature, interesting lyrics will make you think. One of the best Nine Inch Nails CDs to date.
B00005JO1J|5.0|Rent Was So Spectacular Ever Time I Heard The Music And Saw This  <br />Movie I Cried And Laughed With Tears In My Eyes. Your Heart Will <br />Be Filled With Sadness That You Will Wan't To See It More Than Once. I Give This Movie 20 Stars.
B000BJS4BM|5.0|22 years after she first graced the dance floor, Madonna is sending you an invitation to get into the groove again. And if Confessions is anything to go by, she shows the world that she still can dance as well as inspire.<br /><br />Working with her new partners, most notably the savvy Stuart Price, Confessions is a 12-track segued mix of dance ecstasy. Lead single, Hung Up, amazingly mixes Abba's 1979 hit Gimme Gimme Gimme (A Man After Midnight) with Madonna's and Price's retro-disco fluffiness into a bona fide dance floor anthem. Follow this with the throbs of the electro-futuristic Get Together where Madonna makes you check it out with her as she really wants to be with you. Then, the song fades cleverly into Madonna saying sorry in a few languages before she sends you to gyrate along with Sorry. On Forbidden Love, Madonna morphs into Giorgio Moroder and creates a superb 80s-sounding yet stylish song of two star-crossed lovers. On the Indian-inspired, beats-driven Push, Madonna pays tribute to the one (presumably Guy Ritchie)who has constantly pushed her to her best.<br /><br />On Confessions, Madonna's lyrics are never overly self-indulgent though short of any major revelations that we don't already know. There are self-discovery, enlightenment, empowerment, love, and lament.<br /><br />Confessions is a true return to form for the Queen of Pop, something all fans have been eagerly waiting for.<br /><br />The expanded version includes a 13th track Fighting Spirit, an electronic dance track with an uplifting message. Other goodies include a journal book with selected entries by Madonna, a picture book and 1-month trial membership to ICON, Madonna's fanclub. This is by far, the best Madonna special edition.<br /><br />For fans only.
B000BMSTMS|1.0|I realize that over years some bands change, sometimes for the better, but Korn had taken so many steps backwards, that maybe its time for them to go back to square one. First off, let me say that I am not a huge Korn fan, but I really did enjoy the first album, as I thought that they were very talented. As the years wore on, so did Korn on my nerves, as they became more of a pop/nu metal band, and I just wasn't digging the new sound anymore..Yet....the music was still heavy, they still had potential. The other day I turned on MTV to see Korn's first single from this album. I thought how sad was this. A band that wrote probely the most disturbing song of the time \\"Daddy\\", going to a goofy video with hip-hop muscians playing their roles. Not only was that goofy, but their music sucks to. I realize that they lost their guitarist, and sometimes losing a band member is tough, but come on...They can do a lot better then this. Its like they are a pop band playing with no feel. Listen, dont get me wrong....I am not mad at the fact that the album isn't as heavy as the old stuff. Hey the Deftones first CD was heavy as hell, and a few years later they released the much mellower \\"White Pony\\", which was a great album though. Even though not as heavy, the album pushed the bands limit of talent even further. Korn has so much more to offer then this, and hopefully they will realize it on the next album.
B00008PC2O|4.0|I bought this thinking it was a third release of T2.  I had the \\"other\\" edition and reading these reviews thought this was the one with three versions.  NOPE!  The one I had was actually the \\"Ultimate Edition\\".  This is just \\"Extreme\\"  :rolleyes: (It's #2 of the 3 different versions). <br /> <br />Simply put: when you buy this, realize it is NOT the \\"Ultimate Edition\\" referred to the reviews below and will not have the \\"Special Extended Version\\" of T2.  Amazon usually puts a warning when a review is based on a different version, but failed to do so this time.  \\"Forewarned is fore-armed\\" as my mum used to say :) <br /> <br />As for T2?  Well, ANY version is gonna be sweet... :)
B00005J9M3|5.0|Fantastic album by the PSB. The real gem is 'So Hard\\", sort of their version of I Feel Love.
0553801503|5.0|I waited so patiently for so long for this book to come out, that when it did (and I grabbed a copy from the store the very day it was released) I wanted to take my time and enjoy it slowly, a couple of chapters a day.  I made it that way for two days, and then I began to devour the thing.  Yup, took me a week to read it--and that includes time out working at a grown-up job. <br />I got a chance to meet the man and have him sign my book--awesome experience.  Very nice guy. <br />About the book itself, my only complaint is the bit about Cersei's flashbacks about the witch.  And that wouldn't be a complaint at all if it had been even hinted at in the previous books.  It fits--and explains a lot of her relationships, and builds suspense, increases tension, all the reasons it should stay in--I think I was just a little disappointed that it came in so suddenly. <br />All in all, I'm re-reading the book already, searching for the finer details.  And again waiting patiently for the next.
B000BTJDGC|5.0|We're all dogged by our own little demons that cast doubt, shake our faith in ourselves and pull apart our world. However unlike the character of Emily Rose in this thought provoking drama none of our demons are named Lucifer. \\"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\\" tackles the issue of faith, how science has displaced our belief system rationalizing everything around us and pulled us out of the psychological barbaric dark ages. The film dares to ask, what if our rational side is wrong? What if there are supernatural forces beyond our comprehension which drive the world around us every day? A compelling tale that mixes fact (the film is based on the true story of Anneliese Michel documented by Dr. Felicitas Goodman in the book \\"The Exorcism of Anneliese Michel\\") with the format of a suspense thriller, court room drama and delves into the place of faith and reason in our society. I've seen many people disappointed by the fact that this isn't \\"The Exorcist\\". This is a suspense drama NOT a horror film like \\"The Exorcist\\". The exorcism itself isn't the focus of this movie but, instead, a sidebar. This is really about the after effects of what happens to Father Moore and Erin.<br /><br />Laura Linney plays defense attorney Erin Bruner an agnostic gun for hire that recently won a highly publicized murder trial. When the head of her firm (Colm Feore) asks her to take on a case for the Catholic Church involving a priest Father Moore (Tom Wilinson) accused of negligent homicide of Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter) she finds her disbelief melting as she's drawn further and further into the case. It seems that Emily, her family and Father Moore believe that she was possessed by the Devil. The prosecutor Ethan Thomas (Campbell Scott) is a man of strong religious beliefs who finds himself convinced that the girl was an undiagnosed epileptic who died because she was denied nutrition, medical help and the medication to control her seizures. This collision of church and state creates more than sparks as Erin discovers disturbing evidence that Father Moore may be right. She's further disturbed when strange things begin to occur to her just as they did to Emily and to Father Moore after the death of Emily. A warning though to fans expecting gore galore--this isn't your typical horror film like \\"The Devil's Rejects\\" or \\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\". Instead, it's more of a suspense thriller using elements of the horror genre.<br /><br />A thought provoking film filled with intelligent performances, some genuinely scary sequences and many unanswered questions, \\"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\\" may come across as a bit too pat at its conclusion but the ride itself makes the film worth it. This unrated version runs about 3 minutes longer than the theatrical version.<br /><br /> \\"Exorcism\\" doesn't have the heavenly glow of the many brightly colored epics and comic book films we've seen this year and that works to the film's advantage. Filled with moody cinematography, striking images and plenty of mystic fog the transfer looks very good. There are some minor issues with compression particularly during one sequence involving heavy fog but, on the whole, the film captures the stark and scary look of its theatrical debut. The 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround soundtrack becomes genuinely spooky during many of the scenes involving Emily and Father Moore but the more tense court room scenes come across as much more passive involving only the ambience of the court. That stark contrast between these two worlds and experiences make the scenes involving Emily's \\"breakdown\\" and exorcism all the more riveting.<br /><br />We get a featurette that examines the history of the film and how the real event inspired the filmmakers to tackle such a daunting project with such an unusually intelligent approach. There's also a featurette that focuses on the visual approach for the film this is interesting as the director is, essentially, telling two different stories from two different points ofview. As I mentioned before very few films have balanced the thriller aspects with those looking at the role of faith in our society and \\"Exorcism\\", like \\"The Exorcist\\", manages to transcend the limitations of the genre. We also get a single deleted scene that, although important from a character development point of view, clearly would have slowed the narrative down and was wisely extracted.<br /><br />The commentary by director/co-writer Scott Derrickson focuses on many aspects of the production from the elements they borrowed from the real case to those of performance and integrating visual effects into the film in a believable fashion. The latter was missing from both \\"Dominion\\" and \\"The Exorcist: The Beginning\\" and, hence, undermined both those films from becoming little more than a footnote in the suspense/thriller/horror genre. In many respects, Derrickson's film acts almost as a \\"sequel\\" to \\"The Exorcist\\" (as that film was also based on a real life exorcism they share an incident that occurred as the basis of their projects). Derrickson's comments are intelligent and thoughtful about the project and the challenges he and his cast faced in making the story both compelling and believable.<br /><br />The unrated version (which is the version I saw)doesn't appear to me to feature any more gore than the theatrical version. My guess is that it features scenes that run just a tad bit longer but weren't included in the theatrical version. While the film sputters a bit by the time of the conclusion, the two hour journey was still more than worthwhile. A warning though to fans expecting gore galore--this isn't your typical horror film like \\"The Devil's Rejects\\" or \\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\". The film manages to combine elements of \\"The Exorcist\\" and shows like \\"Law & Order\\" into a compelling mix all its own. Drawn into the darkness that consumes Emily both Father Moore and Erin are changed forever by their experience.view.

630398021X|1.0|I'd like to rate this negative 5, but 1 is the lowest Amazon offers.<br /><br />This movie seemed very pointless.  Boring.  It has almost no plot and goes nowhere.  The characters are unlikely and poorly developed.  I turned this movie off 3/4 through it.  I can only say that about maybe 5 movies in my life.<br />What finally made me turn this off was a very sick scene involving rape, torture, and murder.  I've seen movies that are rated X that were cleaner.  I'm no prude, but this was a disgusting movie.<br /><br />Save yourself some time and watch a porn video.

I have a Bacherlor`s Degree in history, and thought I knew pretty much about the 14th century. I knew it was bad and cataclysmic. It was worse. Much worse. I almost wept when I read of the greed, stupidity and pettieness almost every nobleman and king possessed. And it scares me that I seem to see something familiar in the times we now live in. Buy the book!!

B0002NRQTI|4.0|This is another solid if not spectacular entry in the Rush catalogue and a must-own for Rush fans. Counterparts is a unusually good CD because you can pretty much listen to it continuously without having to skip from song to song...and in my humble opinion those are the makings of a strong record. Not every song on this alblum is a classic, but some certainly are. If you can't rock out to Cut To The Chase, find some appreciation in the crystal clear sound of Everyday Glory, or appreciate the band's attempt to write about serious social issues (Nobody's Hero) you are missing the point. There's even some edgier songs like Stick It Out for those looking for something a liitle heavier. Not all of the songs rock the house down, but there's no filler here either....just solid good music which Rush's fans have come to expect over the years!
B00002Z88D|4.0|This was one of the first albums I ever bought. I still listen to it all the time, but I have moved on to bigger and better things. <br />Good Points: I love how the orchestra weaves in and out of the pounding drums, wailing guitars, and harsh vocals. <br />Bad Points: I has too much post Black Album material. We could do without Devil's Dance, Bleeding Me, Until It Sleeps, and Outlaw Torn. We could do alot better with Seek & Destroy, Ride The Lightning, Fade To Black, Creeping Death, Fight Fire With Fire, Welcome Home (Sanitarium), Disposible Heros, Eye of the Beholder, and Dyers Eve. <br />The people that think this is basically a greatest hits album are wrong. Its missing the GREATEST part. The songs are good, but it isn't the best.
B00006J9OT|4.0|I'm not a huge fan of jazz or the blues but this album really does it for me.  Diana Krall's voice is deep, smooth and full of bass.  Her voice fills your speakers and the room in a way that simply emits atmosphere.  Her band seems very tight and professional as they really serve as a perfect backdrop to Krall's abilities and talents.  The set list is good mixture of different tempos and textures and offers quite a bit of variety.   <br /> <br />This is one of those types of CD's that I would always hear in coffee shops and really like, but knowing nothing of thier existence, wouldn't even know where to begin when purchasing.  This CD is really great to listen to reading a book on a rainy day.  It reminds me of Sunday mornings, hardwood floos, and breakfeast in diners but I'm not really sure why. <br /> <br />Bottom Line:  A great pickup for those who aren't familiar with this type of music.  Very friendly jazz.  I would imagine regular this is old hat for seasoned jazz and Krall fans.
B0002B15WE|5.0|This is definitely in my top movies, in fact, it is among the best movies I have ever seen. I give it a perfect 10 out of 10. Here is how the movie goes: It is Christmastime in Los Angeles, California and a man named John McClane is returning home to his family for the holidays, even though he is normally a police cop on his own or on a swat team. He talks to his wife, and they get into a bit of an argument. Meanwhile, in the center of the hotel where John and his family, not only his wife, but also his son and daughter, are, lots of people are singing, partying and celebrating Christmas. Nobody knows of nor expects the fact that a group of money hungry terrorists are on their way, and they all want this hotel's wealth. On top of that, they want to take some people hostage so no one can follow them. Their leader, Hans Gruber, takes a man captive, and tries convincing him to hand the money over, but the man refuses. Gruber promptly shoots him in the head. John sees that there are terrorists, and he gets some guns and hunts them down, forgetting his shoes! That's right-he fights all these evil people BAREFOOT! He fights and kills some terrorists, then comes across a member of Hans Gruber's gang who REALLY wants to tear him in half. He gets away, but the terrorist gang is still attacking everyone, including John's family, and holding them hostage in case any cops show up. Soon, John is in a battle with more terrorists, and though he kills them, Hans and his \\"I want John's blood\\" member see him trapped in glass and blast it to bits, giving him no choice but to walk on the glass and cut the bottoms of his feet. He manages to get them washed and wrapped, but very soon other police, who he's tried to alert, arrive. Only one believes him, and to make matters worse, the one who wants to kill John bad, who by the way is a VERY BIG MAN and amazingly strong, grabs him. They get into a fight, and when it seems like John's opponent will win, John is resourceful. He gets a weaponand kills his enemy with it. Finally, the cops find out that John was right, and while they gun down the remaining hench men of Hans Gruber, John goes up to a high office to find Gruber himself. Gruber says a few slurred words of insult, and then he shoots another man. He also fights with John all the way down & grabs his wife. He is ready to blow her brains out, but John has a trick up his sleeve which distracts Hans just long enough for John to draw his gun and shoot him. Hans goes hurtling out the window and falls to his demise. John hugs his wife, and he and his family as well as all the people go home for the holidays. This movie is damn near perfect. It has great acting, many cool and/or funny quotes, and this is as good as Bruce Willis gets, as far as I'm concerned. If you like action movies, this is for you.
B000AP04FG|1.0|Being fans of both Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie (and having NO interest whatsoever in any personal interaction between them during their off-screen time), we were enthused to see this movie, expecting snappy dialogue, high production values and a good story.  Considering the star power involved, shouldn't you expect some semblance of quality in a film? <br /> <br />It was all my husband and I could do to ENDURE the full length of this disaster called a movie.  Where do I start? <br /> <br />Throughout the movie you will recognize scenes taken almost word for word from other high action movies, but never done as well as the original. The sound/music is horrible (except for 2 or 3 snippets of smooth latin flavored numbers at the very beginning and end), uneven and irritating (let's say \\"techno-inspired elevator music\\"), often making the dialogue impossible to hear.  The photography is neither interesting nor flattering and the lighting the same, no good camera work at all.  No character development to make you care what happens to these people, apparently sacrificed for an abundance of not very well done special effects and neat gadgetry, all very industrial.  The story is both simplistic and disjointed and not very far into the movie we stopped caring. <br /> <br />This movie tried and failed in a \\"too cutesy\\" way to be everything to everyone (drama, action, romance) and failed miserably in all areas.  Somehow, they even managed to make Pitt and Jolie look less attractive than either would look strolling down the street in casual attire headed for the market.  Neither actor did well delivering \\"oh so cute\\" snappy lines and Angelina's overly serious, eye darting looks and poutiness have become boring.  We admire both actors for their humanitarian work and off-screen charitable interests, and have enjoyed both in other movies, but \\"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\\" are as boring as the name implies!! <br /> <br /> <br />A waste of time and money!
0553801503|1.0|Well, it finally happened; the excitement has petered out.  The great story from the previous books has been watered down and downright drowned in worthless dialogue. There are so many characters that I could care less about.  Great characters of the past books have not had so much as a reference, two hundred pages into the book.  This reminds me of my loss of interest in The Wheel of Time series where great character stories are sacrificed for the sake of volume and dragging out the series.  No wonder this book took so long to be released; it stinks!

B00005V1Y0|5.0|This is one of those films you just can't help loving. It's got everything a movie needs: romance, suspense, great music and a funny/quirky/original script. There are documentary-like moments that lure you into believing in these people and in everything that happens to them. The premise is quite simple: the judges of ballroom dancing competition fight viciously to make sure that \\"there are NO new steps in ballroom!\\" Enter our rebel hero, Paul Mercurio, who stubbornly defies tradition by demonstrating that there ARE new steps for ballroom. That said, just sit back and enjoy. Again and again.
B000BJ7BCA|5.0|Okay it might just be the dorky kid inside of me but I like super hero movies. And especially this movie because it was just so simple and good. It didn't have to be complicated like a lot of other super hero movies. Of course it didn't knock out spiderman or kick batman on his butt but hey it was still a great movie. It was a different view of the superhero world and it is a great movie to watch with your kids or little cousins or whatever you have. I would suggest renting this first because this movie isn't for everyone, especially if your teen and use to the regular super action thrillers. Though I really urge you to give this one a try, I thought it was excellent.
0060989157|5.0|As a non-fan, whose knowledge of the Crue only extended to snippets picked up while flipping through tabloids, I thought this book would fail to hold my interest. I was dead wrong; whether you are a fan or not, even if you can't stand glam metal, even if you couldn't care less about the band, you WILL enjoy this book. Trust me.
B000BJS4BM|5.0|The Bonus Track included in the special Edition is top-quality material, added to an already impressive CD. (plus alot other extras that allow you to get the other bonus track \\"Super Pop\\" from Internet).
B0002OERI0|1.0|I am not a green day fan at all, but i like some of there older stuff. I bought this album because a friend of mine said it was \\"the best album ever!\\" i bought it and there were one or two songs worth listening to, the rest sucked balls. if you want to hear real \\"Green Day\\" buy \\"Dookie\\" instead...
B00005JNQA|4.0|A good political thriller, the Interpreter brings to the screen exactly what the title indicates.  It is the story of an interpreter who works for the United Nations in NYC.  Things get a bit more complicated when she overhears a conversation indicating a plot to assassinate an African leader during his upcoming visit to the UN...  <br />The film combines drama, action and adventure making it highly enjoyable. <br />Nicole Kidman, Sean Penn, and the rest of the cast have done a very good job with their performances!   <br />In short, though far from being a masterpiece, it is a movie worth watching!   <br />
B000006TRV|3.0|Pink Floyd's The Wall can be said to be the last decent album made by the Floyd, however that does not mean it is their best.  Not even close.  While songs like \\"Hey You\\", \\"Goodbye Blue Sky\\", \\"Comfortably Numb\\" and \\"Run Like Hell\\" are probably as good as any other period Floyd, the album is weakened by too much filler.  The songs \\"One of My Turns\\", \\"The Trial\\", \\"Goodbye Cruel World\\" and \\"Young Lust\\" sound like something out of a Simpsons musical parody (ie Troy McClure's Planet of the Apes), and Roger Waters' lyrics are quite uneven, alternating between brilliant wordplay, \\"hey you/out their in hall/waiting for someone to call out/would you touch me?\\" to banal hokum, \\"mother will break my balls/ ohhh mother should i build a wall?\\"  <br /> <br />If made into a single disc album I think this would have been awesome.  The songs that make this worth listening to are:  <br /> <br /> <br />Another Brick in the Wall <br />Mother  <br />Hey You <br />Comfortably Numb <br />Run Like Hell <br />Goodbye Blue Sky <br />
B000BVEKO0|5.0|We can bet this is Korn's climax and their not stopping any time soon!! Wow.. from the funkyness of 'twisted transistor' and 'open up', to the dark vibes of 'love song' and 'seen it all', not to mention the great heavy feeling of 'liar' and 'getting off'. Wow, they didn't stick to one style, i'm proud. This CD will not disappoint you -even if your not a fan.<br /><br />Also the biggest surprise was 'TEARJERKER'. Jonathan sings like never before.. so high. This song carries such an eerie feeling and ambience. One of their greatest CDs.
B000AARKOO|3.0|Orlando Bloom proves how pretty he is even when covered in dirt. He's actually the prettiest person in the movie. Even a step above all the female roles. I think there are two of those.<br /><br />I think movies like this are hard to make. Troy and Alexander both ran into the same problems. If you're not familiar with the history you'll be pretty much lost when you view the film. I'm sure this is a good movie but I didn't really understand it and I was pretty bored up until the last battle.<br /><br />Maybe I'm just too dumb for this movie. Which is possible.
014017821X|5.0|I had to read this book for one of my college courses and absolutly loved it. The way Carter twists the fairy tales and adds a sometimes morbid clencher is excellent. I loved the statments she was making in them and the way stories were told was excellent. As was the fact that women weren't made out to be weak or that their only rightful place was in the kitchen. Out of all the stories in the book I found \\"The Tigers Bride\\" (re-telling of Beauty and the Beast) and \\"The Company of Wolves\\" (re-telling of Little Red Riding Hood) to be my favorites.
B0000067X1|5.0|This is one of my favourite albums, and my favourite Can album (Soon Over Babaluma and Future Days coming second and third). The first couple of tracks break you in reletively gently and have nice hooks that catch your attention, after that things get a bit more abstract (espesially \\"Aumgn\\") and it takes a few listens to fully appreciate the album as a whole. An extremely rewarding listen though, dont miss out.
B0007Y08IS|3.0|This movie had its moments of humor for certain (Alec Baldwin F.A.G., Sean Penn F.A.G., Tim Robbins F.A.G, etc) and the Kim Jong Il character was pretty funny.  Where things really fell apart was the sex scene with Lisa and Gary.  While marionette sex was pretty funny to watch at the beginning because of the obvious humor associated with making puppets move in strange positions, the creators quickly gave the Kama Sutra a run for its money, using every position and type of sex imaginable.  I was surprised by the golden shower, and another scene which I will not discuss, but the sexual defication was just completely disgusting. I cannot believe someone would put that in a movie, unrated version or not, marionettes or not.      <br /> My advice is, that if you plan to buy the movie, buy the R rated version.  The unrated version adds nothing, unless you are into watching pupptets have bizarre sex.  If there are any kids in your house, be sure NOT to buy the unrated version. The movie has a superhero kind of appeal on the package and it looks like a movie which kids would throw in the DVD player if it was in the cabinet with the rest of the DVDs.  Then you will be stuck explaining the bizarre sex scene - best of luck with that.
B000BTC5LW|3.0|Don't get me wrong, this is alright visual and sonic record of your average Pink Floyd show, but it's far from a masterpiece.  <br /> <br />The Wall live or maybe 'A Delicate Sound of Thunder' would be a much better choice for the first real Floyd concert to get the DVD treatment. 'Delicate' had warmth and depth to both the sound and the video (that used actual movie style film whereas this used video tape). <br /> <br />I suppose my biggest issue with PULSE is that while the performances are mostly perfect, they are cold and barren sounding, like a band tired of playing the same songs over and over. Roger Waters' 'In the Flesh' DVD may have not sounded as original, the group obviously enjoyed themselves and that came through making the viewing more pleasurable. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, I intend on getting this when it comes out (whenever that may be), but please forgive me for wishing the Wall or 'Delicate Sound' had been released first.
B00021LMTU|5.0|I too was very impressed with the book. I have read all the Arthur books and seen all the movies. I love the legends. Arthur, Morgan, Guenivere (I know its spelled differently but I prefer this one), Vivan, and Lancelot. I expected to enjoy this and I did but not for reasons I expected. What I really enjoyed was the struggle between the Pagan World and the Christian World. This is the first book that I've read that shows the struggle and what it was like for the Pagans who were loosing more and more people to the Christian faith. Pagans are generally considered bad or evil \\"Mists of Avalon\\" protrays them as a religion fight hard to stay alive as everything changes around them. Morgan fights for this through the whole book. Sometimes its agrivating but you have to wonder how you would have handled everything you believe in suddenly being considered evil, sinful, and wrong.
B000AA305M|1.0|David Gray is great.  Have most of his recent albums.  This one is not quite as good as White Ladder.  I'd give it a 3 or 4 based on music alone. <br /> <br />Now for the bad parts.  #1 I can't listen to the music.  #2 SONY has installed spyware on my computer without me saying OK to their EULA. <br /> <br />I do not listen to CDs.  I rip them (which is fair use - I don't share) and listen to them either through my home network or on several various mp3 players from my car, desk at work, or my pocket.  Several of these devices do not support digital copyright and I don't want them to.  This CD copy protection will not let me listen to music the way I want to. <br /> <br />I struck the CD in my computer and an autorun came up with a EULA.  Realizing that it wanted to install spyware I clicked NO.  I intend to return it and get my money back.  Unfortunately I just read that it is installed despite me saying NO.  This seems about the same as a virus - is there any way to sue these B@#$%^&s? <br /> <br />Don't let Sony CDs near your computer unless you want spyware running on it.

0792846443|5.0|I recall starting to watch \\"Misery\\" for the first time in the beginning of the 90s. After first twenty minutes I thought: \\"What's going on? This is not a usual Stephen King plot (I haven't read \\"Misery\\" at that time). Well, some car crash, a lady is nursing James Caan, blah, blah, blah...\\" Anyway I was stupid enough to quit watching after those twenty minutes thinking it's some boring crap. If only had I watched another five minutes! Bacause when I did a couple of years later I was damning my own foolishness. \\"Misery\\" appeared to be one of the most thrilling and gripping chillers I've ever seen. The story is so simple you begin to believe it's quite possible. It really could happen in real life. Why not? There are plenty of lunatics out there.<br /><br />So if you haven't seen it (which I doubt), buy \\"Misery\\" right now. But watch first and then read, not to be disappointed, because books are almost always better then films :)<br /><br />And if you've seen the movie and just want to have it on DVD, I'd advise you to purchase British special edition (by Universal), available on amazon.co.uk. Unlike American one it has commentaries by director Rob Reiner and writer William Goldman, photo galleries, composer Marc Shaiman's \\"Musical Misery Tour\\" featurette and a half-hour \\"Misery Loves Company\\" documentary. I guess, if you really like the movie all these extras will be rather useful for you.

B000002U82|5.0|In the four amazing albums that Pink Floyd created, Dark Side, wish.., Animals, and The Wall, they never realised what getting this music was doing to them. You see, to get an amazing work of art, you have to go to a dark and scary place. Somewhere you're not sure you can come back from. This happened with JD Salenger, Rivers Cuomo(Weezer), and Kurt Cobain, though he had drug problems as well. Bands like U2 did it with Actung Baby, but got out before they went to far. <br />  After the success of Dark Side, Roger Waters started getting emotionaly exausted. After Animals, he broke down and began work on the Wall. After the wall, he lost it. Pink Floyd went to far, and now they can't come back. This is what they pay for going so deep into them selfs.  <br /> <br /> Dark side is something to explore. Its very deep and dark. Enjoy it, but remember what had to happen to get it here, and relize that pink floyd can not set their differences aside and continue writing. All they have are these four fantatic pieces of art.

B000003TA4|1.0|<br />In case you haven't noticed, everyone in this land of ours is entitled to say what they want, including those who aren't so comfortable with gays and other minorities. And quite frankly, I'm tired of all this politically correct bullsh*t the public is force-fed. No matter what someone's belief is, any American citizen should be able to handle it, whether they disagree with it or not. Sure, I don't think there should be discrimination against anyone either, but when you have ethnic minorities being handed jobs and college admission just because of the color of their skin, then that's discrimination too (but colleges like to call it \\"quotas\\"). Affirmative Action is bad, plain and simple. It rewards people for their appearance rather than their skills. Nirvana was a band that was totally for bullsh*t like that; I can't believe he wrote in the Incesticide liner notes that he wanted his fanbase restricted to just people who think like him. Maybe if Cobain laid off the heroin he would have realized that he could have shared his views with those who think differently from him, and then they could have been enlightened. But the roadblock there would have been the fact that Cobain never wrote anything enlightening, socially or otherwise.  <br /> <br />And since when do gays and colored people need a rank junkie to speak for them? They can speak for themselves. I hate it when straight people think all they have to do is mug for The Advocate and then be hailed for their \\"social consciousness\\".

B00020HEL6|5.0|There is no other explanation for this 15-year olds voice than that she has an old soul.  Her music is powerful and classic yet current and edgy.  A wonderful album to play for company or simply with a glass of wine while making dinner.  Refreshing and soothing, I think it's a must have in any jazz lovers library.
B00005AQGH|5.0|In my opinion, this is the best hip hop/rap cd ever released. It's better than Paid In Full, Ready To Die, or Illmatic. Sure, those albums are all considered classics but this album is still better. It has so much truth and heart, how could it not be the best? Any rapper can use multisyllabe flows, or paint vivid descriptions, but few could speak from the heart like 2pac could. This album shows people that 2pac wasn't just the weary remorseful rapper on Me Against The World nor was he completely the thug rapper on All Eyez On Me. This a great example of the duality of man and how we all feel different feelings. Few rappers could so easily describe feeling sad to angry to in love to suicidal like 2pac could. This is what makes this album better than all other hip hop/rap albums released.
B0009YNRZM|5.0|This remaster is simply great. Sound quality is all why you are paying twice the price for this cd, buy if you are Zappa fan, this should not matter. This is the milestone for MOFI to release gold Zappa remaster.  <br />Needless to say that several noises missed from 90's remaster will not substitute for overall picture of superior hi-fi sound.
B00003CXRM|5.0|This movie was one of the funniest movies I've seen.  It completely takes the viewer back to rural Mississippi in the 1930's.  George Clooney, who plays a fugitive from a chain gang with a dry sense of humor, is excellent as well as his fellow partners in crime, Pete and Delmar.  Ulysses Everett McGill, Clooney's character, makes the movie really funny by the way he is so obsessed with his hair treatment.  He goes through quite a few cans of it because the look of his hair is very important to him.  The movie keeps your attention and goes by fast because each scene is so different and you never know what to expect.  With so much scenery, action, and humor, this movie is definitely a hit.

0307263118|4.0|The Sea is a work of superb artistry, but this doesn't become clear until you're well into the book.<br /><br />The story in told in the first person by Max Morden, an art critic of no great reputation, whose wife, Anna, has recently died of cancer.  In his grief, Max flees to the small seaside town where as a boy he summered with his parents.  He deliberately puts up at the same boarding house where his childhood friends, the Graces, used to stay.  In the first part of the book, Max tries to articulate how he feels about Anna's death and slowly unfolds the tale of his youthful entanglements with the Grace twins, Chloe and Myles.<br /><br />Max comes across as a bit of a blowhard.  His verbal style is full of false bravado, rhetorical tics and bombastic pronouncements about loss and memory.  We're reminded again how fine writing, even prose as lush and well-wrought as Banville's, can obscure as well as illuminate.  As Part 1 builds to its somewhat overwrought climax, we're wondering what Max - and Banville - are on about.<br /><br />But in Part 2, the novel slows and deepens; in the process, what we've already read is seen in a new light.  Max's posturing and evasions are exactly what both he and Banville have been on about - the ways we construct and defend a self, and how inadequate those defenses are against the inevitable running down of the organism.  In Part 2, both Max and the author seem to be saying, \\"but enough of all that.\\"  When Max stops spinning defensive constructs, other truths have the opportunity to emerge.<br /><br />This being a Banville novel, it's never quite that simple, because Banville doesn't view the self as a fixed, immutable point.  Max tells us in a revealing passage, \\"... even the notion of an essential singular self is problematic.\\"  As a boy, Max loves to watch birds, especially to discover where they built their nests.  A Banville hero constructs the self the way a bird builds a nest, a random assembly of opportune scraps.  Like a nest, this self is something impromptu and temporary pretending to permanence.<br /><br />As Max digs deeper into his memories of the Graces, and especially his boyhood romance with the newly pubescent Chloe, he achieves a curious insight: the more concrete his memories get, the more manufactured they probably are.  We who have been taught that truth lies in particularity are brought to see that this same particularity is also the raw material for credible but false constructions.<br /><br />By the book's end, we learn what drove Max back to the haunts of his boyhood, and we see that he will emerge from the fog that surrounds those caught between the dead and the living.  He will go on, not because he wants to, particularly, but because he can.  Both the paradox and the triumph of this superbly realized work is that out of Max's posturing, out of his erratic manufacture of memories, emerges something as poignant, illuminating and half-grasped as truth itself.<br /><br />The book has other, smaller pleasures, such as the sensuousness of Banville's prose, his painterly eye for nature, and the precision with which he captures the intensity of what a child sees and feels.  The Sea richly deserves the Booker Prize it was awarded this year.  Few novels illuminate so well the torments and consolations of the modern consciousness.omptu and temporary pretending to permanence.

B0007M22TI|5.0|I watched this on PBS three times.  I ordered it from Amazon immediately.  If it was patched, so what.  The final take is captivating! Everyone in my family gets it for Christmas. <br />I did tell the family to be sure to watch with a good sound and video system.  I have excellent sound and graphics systems with my pc.  <br />And watching in full screen letterbox really increases the enjoyment. The quality of sound and color graphics with better equipment is astounding.  <br />I do aggree that subtitles of the lyrics would be nice (or maybe publish the lyrics with the DVD). I agree that the flashing spots were distracting and more close ups of the musicians and chorus would improve the presentations.   <br />However, those of you who were distracted by the lighting, synching, etc., just listen.... Don't watch. Just to listen is enchanting. <br />
B00080ZG10|4.0|Excellent performances by Dicaprio (to remind people, before TITANIC he was considered one of the most gifted and dedicated young professionals around) and Cate Blanchet, who is always the jewel in the crown of any picture.  Blanchet is so good, it is an entirely forgotten she is playing Kate Hepburn rather than being her.  DiCaprio has his physical appearance against him; the fact he is too 'buff' to be playing Howard Hughes, and he is also baby-faced, which H.H. most definitely was not.  Otherwise, the token girlfriends Faith Domergue and Ava Gardner are attractive but lacking the sizzle and exceptional beauty of either real-life woman.  But the real stunning disappointment was the appearance of Jean Harlow, and I didn't realize at first the person playing her was supposed to be Harlow, as this one was way too sophisticated and OLD.  Jean Harlow was a baby-face discovery as a teenager.  She was only in her mid-twenties when she died, and she was still an innocent looking baby-face when it happened.  That casting was truly bizarre considering the care and attention played to some of the other casting, as if for Harlow the director didn't even try to get it right.  Regards male co-stars, Alec Baldwin's talents are wasted here, he really has nothing to sink his teeth into, the same can be said for Alan Alda, who seems to specialize in playing politicians at this stage of his career; but there is a peculiar lightness to him which makes it impossible to believe he is ever a figure of substantial influence and power - just as well he is a bought man here.  However, the grand story of Hughes itself is played out really well, the cinematophray and screenplay quite literate and sensible.  It is a rather long movie, however, as it is slow in it's detailed construction of a mind falling to pieces.

I was suprised how uncompromising the character was and jeered/cheered him all the way through to the suprising end. Worth a watch and might even get the viewer outside their media washed mind...or not. We need more movies out there like this. Thought provoking and the guilty pleasure of a hollywood action flick!

Although the house is very creepy indeed, I suspect that fans of horror novels will find the story less than terrifying. <br /> <br />On the other hand, people who enjoy books that interleave a scary and violent plot with lengthy digressions on highbrow academic topics will really get a kick out of this book.  In fact I'm fairly confident in saying it's the best of the genre.  You would think the market for this kind of thing would be quite small, but apparently the book was a best seller, so go figure. <br /> <br />Anyway, don't be put off by the zany layout of the text.  Part of the experiment that the author is undertaking is to convey the broad strokes of the plot by means other than the words themselves.  So for instance we have the main character crawling through a passage that grows smaller, all of which is described in text that occupies an increasingly restricted portion of the page.  Sound silly?  Maybe.  But it's not fair to say that the weirdness is gratuitous, and you certainly have to give the guy credit for creativity.  Personally, I found the book to be highly entertaining, and it definitely changed the way I think about my basement.
B000AP04FG|4.0|This movie seemed like \\"True Lies' meets \\"War of the Roses\\" meets \\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\\".  I liked it and enjoyed the way it had fun with the whole ridiculous premise.  Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie hit the perfect balance of playing it straight, but not seriously.  It is an action comedy and a pretty darn good one.  Vince Vaughn adds a nice off beat touch to the whole thing.  Comparing his friendship with John Smith and Jane Smith's team, well, we can see clearly the difference not only in style but in personality.<br /><br />Look, it is hard to take professional killers seriously as people and especially ridiculous that such self-involved cold-hearted professionals appoach marriage as \\"what's it got for me\\" and wonder why their \\"relationship\\" has problems.  However, it does offer a kind of light commentary on 21st century dual professional marriages, doesn't it?<br /><br />Anyway, my advice is to enjoy the movie as fun and not make more of it than it is.  It is kind of a fun story with some just right performances.
B000000JO3|4.0|now don't get me wrong.  i love minor threat, and the ONLY reason this album had a star taken away was the fact that the distortion is..kinda weak.  but that doesn't affect the message...
0689853637|5.0|We were introduced to these through the America Beautiful book. <br /> <br />This one is even more compelling and beautiful.  We have looked through it so many times. I am sure this will be a perenial favorite.  The text is simple enough that my 1st grader can read it, yet compelling enough for grownups.
B0009X7664|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird rates my highest rating possible on at least three levels. <br />1. The film and screenplay are superbly adapted from the Harper Lee Novel. Gregory Peck is Atticus Finch. The child actors Mary Badham and Phillip Alford are natural and very believable. Robert Duvall almost steals the show without even one word of dialoge. <br />2. The disc and it contents are unbelievable and add true value to a already GREAT FILM. There is just a bit of redundancy in some of the documentary materail but this can be forgiven. The \\"A Conversation with Gregory Peck\\" is highly recommended to all who love and respect Gregory Peck.  <br />3. To Kill a Mockingbird in either book and film form provides us true examples of the best and the worst tendencies of mankind. <br />Atticus Finch for instant is what every Father should be and is the lawyer we would want defending us if we were in trouble. On the other hand Mr. Ewell is the devil himself. <br /> <br />This is a movie that should be viewed many times if for no other reason than to remind us of what fine filmaking can be.
0152048049|3.0|The review by \\"Harbor Bookstore (Friday Harbor, Wa. USA)\\" seemed to be getting a bit of grief for downplaying the latest translation.  Having never read either the original translation or the French version, I found the opinion worth researching.  Here is a website from Harcourt that compares the two English language editions side by side, for those like me, who are curious to the differences: [...] <br /> <br />I'd have to agree that the Katherine Woods version seems to carry a bit more charm.  Richard Howard seems to have made a translation to the exact standards of proper grammer.  While that may be a faithful translation of the French words, I could understand the arguement that his translation lacks the poetry from those words. <br /> <br />Decide for yourself. <br />
B000AGTPUK|2.0|I saw this at IMAX 3-D which made the special effects truly excellent. The animation is amazing in its detail and worth seeing on the big screen for that. That said, the story line is pretty thin, the \\"moral\\" of the story way too plainly and insultingly stated, and Santa's downright creepy looking (no jolly old elf here..he looks like a serial killer).  Also don't like the way they treat the reindeer, dragging them around and whipping them.  Not an immortal Christmas show, but maybe worth seeing once just for fun.
068987474X|2.0|Ok, I'm not the typical reviewer or reader of this book. I'm almost 15. I read this book when my friend, who was going through a bad time with a jerk, brought this book for me and my friends to read. Not one of us was, in Greg's very special opinion, was going out with a guy who was really into us. Not one of us had ever met a guy who was really into us. The book depressed us for about a week. Then we decided we had to forget about it. The book says if you're not with Romeo, you're with a jerk. Of course, Greg might be right. I'm not a guy, I don't know. But it seems like less of a way for girls and women to find good men, and more of something to help guys get girls out of their faces. I don't know about you, but I'm going to live life by my own rules.
B000002JSR|5.0|I truly LOVE this album, and I hold it in the same high regard as all the other Zep albums.  The fact that it's a compilation of rehearsals and spares is of no matter at all to me.  A couple of my top Zep favorites are from Coda.  I am totally stunned at some of the negative reviews of this album.  I can appreciate differences of opinion, but in this case, I cannot even fathom how a few reviewers could come up with some of the negative things they wrote.  There are comments to the effect that this album wasn't worth it, that it's terrible cutting room floor junk, that it's weak and mediocre, etc.  I, myself, am more than fond of every single track.  Even some of Coda's worst critics could at least somewhat stand up for 'Wearing & Tearing', which truly smokes!  However, I'm quite suprised that there was barely a mention of my personal favorite, the wildly wanton Walter's Walk!  This song is a playful blitzkreig, a thundering, kick-*** cannonade, which is physically impossible not to break out with air-instruments on (this includes me, a 40 year old female!).  If you truly appreciate this tune as I do, you'll be left almost feverish.  WW is quintessential Zep in my opinion.  We're Gonna Groove is a spasmodic, sexual frenzy.  Poor Tom is a snappy little acoustic tale with an Old West feel.  I Can't Quit You Babe is a superb dress rehearsal that is more explosive than the smoldering Zep I version.  Ozone Baby and Darlene are bouncy, fun and they jam.  Bonzo's Montreaux is an instrumental that reminds you just why Zep couldn't continue without John.  Wearing & Tearing lashes out and grabs you by the figs from, literally, the first bone-crushing second and never lets go.  It's true Zep.  All four of our boys each get to show us their stuff in this album, and I thank God that it was compiled and released, so we could have the privilege to own this rip-roaringly good rock!!
B000BMSTMS|5.0|I absolutely love this album! Korn is at its best, sounding the strongest and most hardcore they've ever sounded, even with the departure of Brian \\"Head\\" Welch earlier this year. Starting off right with \\"Twisted Transistor\\", the album never lets up in intensity. My personal favorites are \\"Hypocrites\\" and \\"Coming Undone\\", the first being their most politically charged song ever! Keep on rocking, Korn! Can't wait to hear your next album!
B000BJS4BM|2.0|I AM PERPLEXED THAT SO MANY PEOPLE LIKE THIS CD - I HAVE TRIED MY BEST TO LIKE IT, BUT TRY AS I MIGHT, I FIND IT BORING.  I MEAN, NOTHING ON THE LP COMES CLOSE TO THE CATCHY HUNG UP SINGLE - AND FOR THIS, LADY MADGE HAD THE HELP OF SUPERTROUPERS ABBA.  AND IS IT JUST ME, OR DOES ANYONE ELSE FIND HER HUNG UP VIDEO UNREAL AND PREPOSTEROUS - DOES ANYONE REALLY BELIEVE THAT A 47 YEAR OLD WHITE LADY WOULD BE DANCING IN A BLACK CLUB WITH TEENAGERS?   OR FOR THAT MATTER, I DON'T THINK BLACK TEENAGERS WOULD BE DANCING TO MADONNA AT ALL.  IN OTHER WORDS, ACT YOUR AGE MADGE.
B000AGTPUK|4.0|A tale of a boy who doesn't believe in Santa Claus, until he takes the Polar Express.<br />This was an amazing show! With a very interesting story. And the animation was amazing.<br />But, the plot could use some work. It just seemed to be a series of exciting events. I also think that they should've put at least a little special features, even though it wasn't the two disc edition.<br />A lot of it was really cool though, and I would definitely recommend it. It is a movie worth your money.
B0007M22TI|1.0|In addition to what others have said about the lip-sync'ed, faked performances totally devoid of soul, the fiddler was not exactly \\"there\\" either.  You can tell when the cameras zoom into where the bow is sliding in the wrong directions along the strings.  If the microphone had been turned on, it would have picked up nothing but screeches.  It seemed that her role there was to provide flashy displays of flailing hair. <br /> <br />I like Enya's music and performance.  I might have liked \\"Celtic Woman\\" a little better had I not seen this \\"concert\\", but just heard it.  But then, what I would hear are diluted versions of the real thing.
6304884419|5.0|I am writing this long overdue review shortly after the real life arrest of Lillo Brancato in the connection of a murder of a New York City police officer.  He played the young man in this splendid movie which deserves to be seen by everybody.  It is a beautifully written and acted production.  Brancato portrayed so accurately the challenges of a young Italian-America youth being raised among the gangsters in his blue collar community.  I always wondered why he virtually disappeared.  Brancato's small role playing a cheap gangster on \\"The Sopranos\\" didn't even begin to equal what had earlier been expected of him.<br /><br />Robert Di Niro is fantastic as the father, a proud bus driver, trying to make sure his only son remains a law abiding citizen.  Chazz Palminteri is likewise brilliant playing the role of the neighborhood Mafia chieftain.  He also wrote the spellbinding script. \\"A Bronx Tale\\" apparently was only modestly successful. I simply cannot understand why it isn't considered as one of the very best movies of that time period. This is a family movie.  Anyone who is a teenager or older should enjoy it immensely.  You truly feel like you are visiting the 1960s.  It is a warm and loving story about choices that must be made early in one's life.  Lastly, why hasn't Di Niro directed more films?  You would think that this particular work of art might encourage the great actor to work more often behind the camera.
0060899190|5.0|This book was a glimpse into the souls of all of us.  It gives the reader a view of people that maybe we're all not so different after all.  I think everyone should read this book.
B00005JO04|3.0|Syriana is a pretentious effort which will not even satisfy those residing on the far left of the political spectrum.  I am admittedly a Zionist neo-conservative.  Am I perhaps allowing a biased frame of reference influence my appreciation of this film?  Nope, not in the least.  I can be very fair and dispassionately honest.  Syriana is simply a poor piece of movie making.  The script is lousy and director Stephen Gaghan fails miserably to tell a story that is interesting and makes any sense.  In a round about way, we are introduced to Bob Barnes (George Clooney) who is essentially an amoral CIA assassin.  He eventually even threatens to murder a woman and her son.  Barnes speaks fluent Farsi and Arabic and will discretely perform the dirty work his bosses require.  Unbeknownst to him the CIA and the mammoth oil companies are cooperating to provide the United States with cheap Middle Eastern oil---and God help those who stand in the way.  We Americans are guilty of supporting unjust regimes who offer few employment opportunities to their young men.  Some of them ultimately turn to Islamic nihilism to give their lives purpose and meaning.  International capitalists don't care who they hurt.  The creators of Syriana apparently take seriously the wacky conspiracy theories of Michael Moore and Noam Chomsky<br /><br />Christopher Plummer, Matt Damon, Chris Cooper, William Hurt, and countless other wonderful actors float in and out of Syriana.  They appear in bewildering scenes that don't seem to go together.  Was this a rush job?  Did the producers have sufficient funding?  Did left-wing ideology trump aesthetic concerns?  Could it be that too many chefs were in the proverbial kitchen?  How can so many talented people go so wrong?  I am giving Syriana three stars, but maybe two would be more appropriate.
B00004ZB9D|5.0|In the mid 1990s, I heard a concert promotion radio ad that was basically introducing the performer to be \\"The World's Greatest Rock and Roll Star\\".    When they announced that star to be Lenny Kravitz, I must admit, I nearly drove off the road when I heard that.    I had realized Kravitz had some commercial success and had a nice following, but \\"World's Greatest Rock and Roll Star\\"?  - Come On!  However, now about a decade later, as I have begun to get a deeper appreciation for what Rock music has to offer, I now realize that perhaps there is some real merit to that radio ad.    I'm still not ready to put Kravitz up there with the upper echelon of Rock with the Paul McCartneys, the Rolling Stones,  Bruce Springsteens, or even Billy Joels - however, it is safe to say that Kravitz could easily be one of the great revelations of the 1990s and has lived completely up to expectations as he has entered the 2000s.    In 2000, Kravitz amassed enough material and success to release his first Greatest Hits album.   This collection, \\"Lenny Kravitz Greatest Hits\\" provides some a great cross-section into Kravitz's musical career and is a great place to start if you are interested in checking out Kravtiz's material. <br /> <br />\\"Lenny Kravitz Greatest Hits\\" hits focuses on the first decade of Kravitz's career (1989-2000).   During this time, Kravtiz would release five solo albums for an average of 1 album every 2 years.     These albums (and the associated tracks included from these albums) are:  1989's \\"Let Love Rule\\" (\\"Mr Cab Driver\\", \\"Let Love Rule\\");  1991's \\"Mama Said\\" (\\"It Ain't Over Til It's Over\\", \\"Stand By My Woman\\", \\"Always On the Run\\");  1993's \\"Are You Gonna Go My Way\\" (\\"Are You Gonna Go My Way\\", \\"Heaven Help\\", \\"Believe\\"); 1995's \\"Circus\\" (\\"Rock and Roll is Dead\\", \\"Can't Get You Off My Mind\\");  \\"5\\" (\\"Fly Away\\", \\"I Belong to You\\", \\"Black Velveteen\\").    As with the case of most greatest hits albums, there is one new song to stimulate album sales among the deep fan base - a very solid song called, \\"Again\\".   It is worth noting that Kravitz's cover of the Guess Who's \\"American Woman\\" is also included on this collection.   This song was part of the soundtrack of \\"Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me\\", but was eventually included on the re-issue of \\"5\\".   One thing that is very nice about this collection is that it is split among the 5 albums just about evenly.   I'm pleased that there are even two songs from his first album which was really not commercially successful. <br /> <br />I think that Kravitz hits the three main dimensions that I expect from a successful solo artist:   Vocals,  Instrumentation, and Songwriting.    On top of these three dimensions, Kravitz cross all of these dimensions by providing a variety of different music styles.    Whether it is hard Rock,  R&B, or Funk - Kravitz finds ways to incorporate these styles and more into his music.  Kravitz was influenced by Prince who also incorporated similar styles into his music.   \\"Lenny Kravitz Greatest Hits\\" will show examples of this wide range of diversity.   You can hear Kravitz's Hard Rock style on \\"Are You Gonna Go My Way\\", \\"American Woman\\",  \\"Fly Away\\", \\"Rock and Roll is Dead\\" and \\"Always on the Run\\".   Songs such as \\"Mr Cab Driver\\" have a definite Funk influence in it - especially on the Bass.  Still songs such as \\"Heaven Help\\" , \\"It Ain't Over Til its Over\\", and \\"I Belong to You\\" show Kravitz' R&B side.   Despite these obvious influences, it is not easy to pigeon-hole Kravtiz's music into one musical genre.  There are many of his songs that definitely cross several of these genres and also break new ground.  Perhaps the best example of this is \\"Black Velveteen\\".   \\"Black Velveteen\\" has been a song that Kravitz has been criticized for, but I happen to think it's the best song he has done.    The song does have a \\"Euro Pop\\" feel, but it you will hear parts of Hard Rock and even R&B overlaid on top of this.  I like how Kravitz tries to do something \\"out of the box\\" and \\"different\\" to his music.     Kravitz's ability to innovate didn't happen late in his career - listen to his early song \\"Let Love Rule\\".  Kravitz uses combines some R&B with some Jimi Hendrix-like sounds to give a unique sound. <br /> <br />As mentioned I think it comes down to the three dimensions I list above.    Kravitz shows incredible range on his vocals - whether it's \\"It Ain't Over Til It's Over\\", \\"Let Love Rule\\" or his new track \\"Again\\", Kravitz will show he is not one dimensional as a vocalist.   From an instrumentation standpoint, Kravitz is well-known for his incredible guitar, but also listen to his Bass work as well.   You'll hear Kravitz incorporate other instruments as well - such as piano on \\"Heaven Help\\" or horns on \\"Let Love Rule\\" and \\"Always on the Run\\".      Lost in this whole picture is some of Kravitz's songwriting - this is perhaps one of the most overlooked dimensions of his talent.   Once again, this can even be traced early to his career - on 1989's \\"Mr Cab Driver\\", he describes the experiences of racism and discrimination. <br /> <br />There is one negative on this collection.  I normally like when an artist puts tracks in chronological order because this allows me to hear how the artist progressed over time.  Unfortunately, this collection does not do so.   It would have been a great strength if this had been done on this collection. <br /> <br />The liner notes include the lyrics to the new song - \\"Again\\".  The songwriting credits as well as what album the song is included on are also included in the liner notes.     Overall, this is as solid a Greatest Hits album as it gets.  The only other negative may be as Kravitz continues to have success, this album might someday be eclipsed by a more current Greatest Hits portfolio.
0064471047|5.0|The Chronicles of Narnia is one of the supreme treasures of all English literature--a wonder in childhood, at coming of age, in adulthood, and in old age.  It is also a bringer of hope and a force for good in a world where despair and evil are present and need resisting.  It is one of the best gifts you can give a child, a friend, or yourself. <br /> <br />You should definitely note, however, that the publisher of this and some other recent editions has made a moronic and despicable decision to change the order in which Lewis intended the books in the series to be read.  \\"The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe\\" is the first book in The Chronicles, and the way Lewis intended his readers to first encounter Narnia.  \\"The Magician's Nephew,\\" the next-to-last book in the series as Lewis wrote it, is a sort of flashback in Narnia's history, and the events related in it take place earlier than those in \\"LWW\\" in a chronological sense.  IT IS IMPORTANT TO READ \\"THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE\\" FIRST, AND TO READ \\"THE MAGICIAN'S NEPHEW\\" SIXTH, AS LEWIS INTENDED.  CHANGING THE ORDER CHANGES THE WHOLE TONE AND ATMOSPHERE OF THE STORY FOR THE WORSE.  Don't let the delusion of the publisher's staff that they somehow outrank C.S. Lewis in literary and artistic judgment rob you of the best possible experiencing of this masterpiece--READ LWW FIRST!
B000BCKFWK|5.0|THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE RECUT, EXTENDED, UNRATED VERSION.<br /><br />=========================================================<br /><br />I have never been a follower of the comic book genre, and therefore the name of Frank Miller was new to me when \\"Sin City\\" came out as a movie in 2005. The movie left a very strong impression on me, I must admit. If the crazy car chases and hyper-violent scenes are not enough for you, perhaps the incredibly faithful transcription from one medium to another that the story has gone through, in going from print to screen, will leave you as speechless as it left me.<br /><br />This reissue of the original theatrical version comes with a slightly alternate (unrated) version of the movie, which was recut and slightly extended in an attempt to make it even more like the original book. If you doubt that a movie can be faithful to a comic book (perhaps disappointed by earlier attempts in some Hollywood blockbusters), you will have a chance to follow the entire \\"The Hard Goodbye\\" story on the screen simultaneously with the included graphic novel... you will be amazed, I promise.<br /><br />As for extra material, there's plenty to wet the appetites of most fans of the genre, Rodriguez and Miller. From cuisine lessons (how to cook Breakfast Burritos) by Rodriguez; to an accelerated green screen version of the movie, where you can fully grasp the technical complexities in its shooting -not too far from how Episodes I, II and II were shot, mostly in the digital world-; there's something for everyone. So sit back, relax (if the movie lets you) and enjoy the Recut, Extended, Unrated version of Frank Miller's \\"Sin City\\".
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|Frankly if you don't like the scenes from the original movie and are offended for your kids don't buy it and above all don't let your kids see this masterpiece. I love the behind the scenes looks at how the movie was done love how the cast and crew got along so well seeing \\"Cal\\" and \\"Roses's Mother\\" out of character and particular how the women in the film were actually dressed with corsets etc as they would have been in 1912. It was a fabulous movie and I still love it 8 years later.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|With this new album Madonna delivers 12 fantastic tracks that blend into eachother in a non stop mix that gets you into the groove!!! It's maby her best ever, and you really can't find a single bad track!!! Some of them ( Sorry,Isaac ) may be some of her best ever!! It is so high class that almost every track could be released as a single and make it to the top-ten at Billboard. Stuart Price creates a magnificent production which doesn't let anybody down. Lyrically Madonna sings about the backside of fame and if everything she's done in her past will make any matter when she's gone. Throughout the songs you get a certain feeling of sadness, happiness and even strengthening which all wraps up in the song \\"Like it or not\\" where she explains that \\"you can love me or leave but I'm never gonna stop!\\"!!! <br /> <br />Best songs: <br />Hung up <br />Get Together <br />Sorry <br />Future Lovers <br />Forbidden love <br />Isaac <br />Push <br />Like it or not
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|I got this CD as an early Christmas present a week ago and can't stop listening to it. What an amazing CD.The music is pounding, frenetic, searing, melodic and jarring all at the same time. The lyrics are satirical, political, sad and nonsensical. Somehow SOAD combine all these elements and make songs that have you banging your head, thinking deeper than maybe you want to and then laughing at some point of silliness. <br /> <br />A lot of people are complaining that the guitar player is singing too much on this CD but I liked what he did here. He doesn't have a good voice in the traditional sense but uses it to good effect and it has an odd symbiosis with the lead singer's voice. <br /> <br />My favorite songs are B.Y.O.B., Cigaro, Lost Hollywood and maybe the best song on the CD, Sad Statue.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|There is some wonderful footage of Bob Dylan at his finest in his early days.  Bob Dylan is like a chameleon, he keeps reinventing himself and the public keeps trying to capture him.  By this act of deception, his fans seek to see past the molting and grasp his essence.  Unfortunately, in the past it was impossible to understand any more about Bob Dylan than what he lets on that day, and this documentary captures just how complex he is.   <br /> <br />With this documentary, we get a rare glimpse into the insecurity that has lead him on this lifelong path of betrayal and hiding.
B000000H6D|4.0|Be warned: this Digipack version of the CD has only 9 tracks where the original had 14. The tracks are also in a different order. To add insult to injury, the digipack includes the insert for the old version of the CD, with track listing and the lyrics for the missing tracks. The only positive thing about this version is there is a previously unreleased track right before the end.
B000BKJ78U|1.0|If you already own the Star Wars Trilogy collection that came out last year then this set is a complete waste of money. With the exception of the new cover and the fact that it does not have the bonus disc the original had this is the same exact collection. If you are looking to pick up the Star Wars Trilogy do yourself a favor and find the edition that was released last year. It has a bonus 4th disc filled with extras that is well worth the extra ten bucks if you are a Star Wars fan.
0307276902|2.0|I kept thinking that a treatment center, and esp. one with the reputation of Hazelden, would never have allowed James to repeatedly carry on in his disruptive way.  Many go into treatment centers with little or no life discipline and order; whether we \\"got\\" it, or were willing to work at \\"getting it\\" the first time or not, hopefully we eventually achieve sobriety by   some means, if not a 12 step program, then some kind of constructive plan of sane and peaceful living. I had a problem with the way the book seems to belittle any kind of disciplined treament, the way James' hero worship of the mobster was glorified, and the general repetition. There are many clues that James is not done abusing chemicals; I hope others that find themselves in his place don't refuse treatment based on his story.

B00005JNTX|3.0|The look of this movie is like nothing I have ever seen, the pages of a comic book come to life on the screen. That alone is an amazing achievement and I wish I ended up liking the movie more than I did. <br /> <br />There are 3 different stories told here, all taking place in the title location of Sin City. Mickey Roarke plays a low life trying to avenge the murder of a prostitute who showed him kindness. The second story has Clive Owen, a murderer, seeking revenge on Benicio Del Toro, a low-life cop, on behalf of his new girlfriend. The last tale is an odd love story between old washed-up cop Bruce Willis and the girl he saves from a psycho when she is 11. <br /> <br />The cast is wonderful on paper, but not all of them give good performances. Some of the dialog and voice-over narration is very well done and some is laughably bad. The film overall is too long and drags after awhile. There is a lot of violence and blood which I have no problem with, except that it was overdone. There comes a point when it doesn't mean anything anymore. <br /> <br />This movie affected me somewhat, but not completely. It is darkly beautiful to look at, even through all the blood.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|this is one of my favorite depeche mode albums ever. they have a constantly changing sound and they have never dissapointed me. this new sound for them works really well. this is a MUST BUY for anyone who likes any era of depeche modes music.
0800177177|5.0|I can remember seeing this movie for the first time. I saw it on tv, entering the story when it had been playing for about thirty minutes.   I was hooked and watched it till the end. The next day I bought the dvd of this truly amazing movie experience, so I could see what I had mist at the beginning.     Francis Ford Coppala's approach is unlike Bram Stoker's famous book, not horror, but more an approach to the Love-side of the story. There still is a lot of horror in the film that really frightens you, but the story is more centerd around the tragic lovelife of count Dracula.   Also, another thing that makes this movie a really fasinating movie experience, is because of some erotic scenes. They make the scenes extremely powerfull wich really helps to power the emotion and the horror. It also makes it the most erotic Dracula film ever.     The movie is made with beautiful sets and colour. There is a real colour theme going on in the movie that is truly maqnificent and wich pleases the eye. The use of music and sound is also fantasticly done. It makes it more frightning and exciting.   The casting of this masterpiece is absolutely perfect.   Gary Oldman plays the count Dracula with true emotion and lust. He steals the show. Also, Winona Ryder as the lovely Mina does a fantastic job. With futher rolls of Anthony Hopkins as the professor Van Hesling,(who plays him with lots of joy and wickedness. He is the one who brings some humor into the dark world the movie is in), Keanu Reaves as Jonathan (A great choice for the part), and Sadie Frost as Lucy (Who really acts great! She made quite an impression on me because she played Lucy perfectly) makes this a wonderfull movie experience.    So are you in for a night of Horror, Erotica, Love, Action, great special effects and a lot of Vampire teeth?  Than \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\" is the movie for you to see.  This movie will truley amaze you from beginning to end. When the credits role over the screen, you do understand the tagline of the movie: Love Never Dies.    Worth viewing many times!
B00005JKC3|1.0|I thought paraphrasing MST3K would be appropriate, because if ever a movie belonged among their catalogue. . . . <br />  Where do I begin? To say this film was a disappointment would be the understatement of the century. Fourty-five minutes into the movie, I was still waiting for it to start. A lot of the other reviewers have echoed my own complaints, so I'll just limit my own observations to the following: <br /> <br />1. Ang Lee was the wrong director for this film -- by his own admission according to an internet news report shortly after the film was released. You can't rely too heavily on the Greek Tragedy elements in an S/F piece, and that's what happened here. It needed an experienced comic book or S/F director such as Brian Singer or even Stephen Sommers. <br /> <br />2. Eric Bana was completely wrong for the lead. But that is the fault of a Hollywood too obsessed with good-looking leading men. Bana was too tall, to handsome, and far too young (I wish the original rumor of Steve Buscemi had been true). <br /> <br />3. Why oh why didn't someone call Peter David to write the script? If anyone could have saved it, it was him. <br /> <br />4. Jennifer Connelly tried hard to save it, but there just wasn't much to work with. <br /> <br />Well, that's it in a nutshell. If you haven't seen this movie, don't bother. The original TV series is better. If you have seen this film, I pity you and share your pain. <br />
B000BIOGV0|5.0|What's not to love about a new Blondie compilation with previously unavailable mixes (including a whole NEW version of \\"In the Flesh'), a second disc with 17 pristine and complete videos (no more of that awful wraparound that's been in every video compliation since 1982's \\"The Best of Blondie\\"), and cover artwork that features the LONG LOST original photography for \\"Plastic Letters\\"--at L.A.'s Tropicana Hotel in 1977--that we've all heard about for decades but never seen? For those assets alone, this is a must-have for collectors.<br /><br />The booklet says all the music was digitally remastered in 1998. Comparing it on my iTunes to the remastered back catalogue that came out in 2001, primarily it is LOUDER which is always good, and clearer, although on some tracks I find I prefer the older versions, perhaps just because I have gotten used to them.<br /><br />In general, all the songs on this compliation are album mixes and not extended mixes. Heart of Glass, thankfully, is missing the weird sound effects that  Mike Chapman added on the 1981 \\"Greatest Hits\\" compilation that has been used on so many compilations since. Sunday Girl, too,  is the album version and not the bi-linqual version. Atomic sheds the \\"Three Blind Mice\\" sounding album intro as well as the looping that plagued the remixes through the years,  Blondie really was so good at making the 3 minute pop record, I always thought their hits work best short and sweet.<br /><br />The only songs which feature new mixes are \\"In the Flesh\\", \\"Good Boys\\" and \\"Rapture\\". \\"In the Flesh\\"  as noted, features a NEW Debbie vocal---it's nice to have this new take on an old favorite, and let's face it, all us Blondie fans have the old one on SOME CD, so I don't think it was a mistake not to include the original \\"In the Flesh\\" here.  \\"Good Boys\\" (Blow Up Mix) to me is inferior to the album/single version, taking a song short on melody to begin with and making it even LESS melodic, and the Rapture remix features the novel idea of combining Blondie's song with Jim Morrison's \\"Riders on the Storm\\" so that Jim and Debbie seem to be duetting! I'm not sure the result is successful, but it's atleast fun.<br /><br />The second disc is all video and features everything from \\"Best of Blondie\\" (minus the NYC cabbie wraparound as mentioned)-- plus \\"The Hardest Part\\" (always one of my favorite Blondie videos), \\"Island of Lost Souls\\", \\"Maria\\" and \\"Good Boys\\".  The early stuff looks incredibly sharp and clear, at last! But the \\"Eat to the Beat\\" videos don't look quite as good. I'm surprised at some of the omissions, like \\"In the Sun\\" \\"Shayla\\", \\"Eat to the Beat\\",  and \\"Nothing Is Real But the Girl\\". But oh well. Maybe one some future box set!<br /><br />And finally, the cover! For years, I have sniped at the awful graphics on Blondie compilations. Perhaps because the band pushed strongly for it--we finally get something great for a cover--two 1977 shots from the long lost \\"Plastic Letters\\" cover shoot which was scrapped by Chrysalis Records, evidently because they did not like the punk look Debbie was sporting in her homemade pillow-case dress with red electric tape binding! I wish there were more than two of these photos in the booklet but hey, who's complaining! Two is better than nothing! Perhaps only because you could not take a bad picture of the band at this time--they are adorable. They also look way ahead of their time. These shots could be on any contemporary album cover. Although from a marketing perspective, the cover that Chrysalis went with--featuring Debbie in a \\"real\\" dress leaning with the boys on a police car--are less raw and punkish than these, and therefore were probably more strategic in breaking the band to a bigger audience. I'd like to see the rest of these pictures, hope there will be a book or something some day!<br /><br />I should note that the videodisc is not encoded for the U.S., so you will not be able to view it properly on your DVD player unless it is an all-regionplayer.

Asrecordings go, iconcur BUT I wasincrediblyfortunate toattend Erich Kleiber's(the father) live concert with the Belgian national symphony  in Brussels.

Erich Kleiber'sperformance  was  a testimony to Beethoven's ferocity and his anger   at his deafness which was nearing totality. Obviously Carlos heard hisfather's performance many times and when he conducted the ViennaP O, an orchestra noted for its lyrical and poetic renditions,the young Kleiber found new insightsand sonorities thatwere somewhat muted  in the elder Kleiber's vocabulary: it is a gentler Beethoven we hear and it too is marvelous.I never liked the Toscanini rigid performance northe Frtwangler celebrated old recoding,whichI found bombastic, almostmilitaristic but I have foundthe Karajan withthe Berlin Philharmonic a worthy second choice on the heels ofthe Carlos Kleiber'. still if youcan find  the mono recording of Kleiber the elder, buy it or steal it( it isn'teven that scratchy a vinyl.I re-recording mycopy on a pro level taperecorder at 7.5 IPS with dbx noisereduction and dynamic retorer.

0838577016|5.0|Every parent knows the agony of trying to find a book to read to their kids at bedtime, but I am happy to report that Kandel has boldly brought a neuroscience entry into to a genre dominated by wizards and talking animals. From the major, one sentence headings every few paragraphs to the bold, brightly colored pictures, this book will hold the attention of even the antsiest of your little ones.<br /><br />The book has a fairly common start, going through the fundamentals of neurons and cell biology, then sweeping through a broad map of the various neural systems--good grist for the little ones, although the motor control chapters are more than vaguely reminiscent of the Dr. Seuss classic \\"Hop on Pop\\". But the book also has a smattering of unusual topics, such as a brief discussion of whether consciousness can be studied by neuroscience techniques, as well as a fascinating description of diseases that will keep adults engaged, as well.<br /><br />My only complaint is that there are a few places where the book becomes a bit too fantasy-driven for my taste. I can suspend reality enough to read about hobbits or Hogwarts, but when I'm asked to accept nitric oxide as a retrograde messenger in LTP, it yanks me right out of the narrative!<br /><br />Overall, however, an excellent book that will help bring the whole family closer together. Your kids will love it!
B000002JR8|5.0|Pantera's VULGAR DISPLAY OF POWER was their calling card. Many band's today sight that album as a big influence. But for those heavier bands, the heavier-than-thou FAR BEYOND DRIVEN was the most brutal metal ever created by Pantera, and one of the loudest records in the metal genre. This was also the first album to debut at No. 1 on the Billboard charts, a feat never accomplished by any other metal band of that time. Dimebag's guitar is just vicious on this album, Vinnie's drums are pounding, and Rex's bass is thumping. But most importantly, Phil Anselmo's vocal vitriol is everywhere, spouting at racists, fascists, punks, and anyone else he feels free to attack.     \\"I'm Broken\\" is among the top ten most memorable and heavy songs by Pantera, it's addictive groove and heavier-than-anvil guitars, all melding to create the perfect metal anthem for a generation of youth inspired on by metal. \\"5 Minutes Alone\\" is another pure Pantera classic, ripping at anyone who thinks they can take on Phil...and not many could. \\"Strength Beyond Strength\\" is just downright vicious, with a punk attitude and a total metal mentality. It's the perfect opener and a precursor of pretty much what you should expect on this album. Other highlights include the slow-burning sludge of \\"Hard Lines, Sunken Cheeks\\"; the brutal domination of \\"25 Years\\"; the jibber-jabber ferocity and blistering guitar lines found in \\"Good Friends And A Bottle of Pills\\"; and the assaulting sonics of \\"Becoming\\". But for me, the most surprising success on the album is the absolutely beautiful cover of Black Sabbath's \\"Planet Caravan\\", a band that was a huge influence on Pantera. To just end a brutal album with an aching, melodic, and downright superb cover takes guts, which Pantera has got a lot of on this album.     So for many metal fans, this album is already in your collection and should be for many years to come. For anyone looking for some of the most brutal metal escapism, this album is definitely for you. And forthe Pantera fan (myself included), you are the reason that this was one of the most successful metal albums ever released. This is the majestic heavy of Pantera...and every headbanger will revel with delight at this intense and solid collection.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|`Amarantine' has all the hallmarks of a typical Enya masterpiece. Even the track order isn't a random selection but thought had been put into the actual track order. It alternates between the slower pieces, mid-tempo and fast pieces. Creating a variety to the listener, be they serious fans or casual listeners, a track order that reminds us of `Watermark', Enya's masterpiece that she unleashed upon the world in 1988.   3 tracks are sung in a fictional language, devised by Roma Ryan, Enya's lyricist, based partly on the sounds Enya would vocalise while she worked on a melody. Roma's contribution shows through the use of symbols for the Loxian alphabet and groundwork for a proper grammar. The 3 Loxian tracks are in `Less than a Pearl', `The River Sings' & `Water Shows the Hidden Heart'. This time the languages used are more esoteric and exotic than ever.   This time Enya's multi-vocals are still evident especially in the background harmonies that enrich the chorus, intros and outros. What is new is that her main vocals are much clearer and stronger, compared to previous releases, whereby layering and multi-tracking had to a certain extent distorted the crispness of the lead vocals. In `Amarantine', fans hear both the clear lead vocal and multi-layered signature harmonies.   If ever there are albums that you can tell from first listen based on 30 second samples that they are good albums, that stand to repeated listen, `Amarantine', joins their ranks.     LESS THAN A PEARL  An opening track typical of Enya style, instrumental and vocals. Usually as a personal preference I take time to like a particular opening track. But `Less than A Pearl' has the pulling power of `The Memory of Trees', that propels me to pay attention at the first chord. After the burst of `high-haah' sighs at the chorus, I am convinced that it is a good track, it is more subtle than the majestic `the Memory of Trees' but no less in terms of melody.     AMARANTINE  A style that is redolent of `Only Time', it is Enya , working on a hooky pop song with universal lyrics. The melody may draw many at first listen like myself, and for others it may take a little longer. Although it reminds me of `Only Time' the high chorus owes more to a church choral hymn than a pop song. As a song, I like it much more than `Only Time' which took me awhile to really like.     IT'S IN THE RAIN  If one listens to the instrumentation and vocal arrangement, it's like `China Roses' meets `Wild Child'. It has the steady pace of `China Roses' but the chorus, infuses it with the elation and emphasis of `Wild Child'. The track ends on a sober note. This piece is best appreciated late at night or during quiet moments to yourself, where you are able to pick out the instrumentation besides Enya's main vocals. Lyrically I'd have preferred something other than `rain' with `again' as its rhyme choice. I have come across criticisms of its lyrics but Roma is making sense in `leaves on tress whispering, deep blue sea's mysteries. It isn't teenage poetry as some will suggest. If you think of it this way...when rain hits the trees, the droplets tell the leaves its origins from the deep blue sea. Rain takes its droplets from everywhere and the most common source is a large body of water, such as the sea.   `Hear my name, in the rain', isn't that strange. How many of us have heard our names on a stormy night as the winds howled through shutters? Can the rhythm of rain not call our names? It isn't that far fetched. It is best listened and taken with a sense of wonderment, then the song really talks to one's soul. `Of the sky as it cries', it's obvious as an allegory of rain.     IF I COULD BE WHERE YOU ARE   This track can easily be traced and relate it to `On Your Shore', `Na Laetha Geal M'oigé', `Smaointe' and such. Melancholy and tuneful, it is moving. Composition wise, it is far more engaging than the other mentioned Enya tracks from previous albums. I can hear those delicate synthesised strings whichwere evident in `Pilgrim' and `May It Be'.     THE RIVER SINGS   Easily the dynamic cousin of laidback  instrumental `River' from `Watermark', `The River Sings' is a masterfully executed fast paced Enya track. Melodically, with its painstaking multi-tracked harmonies and counter harmonies weaving in and out of the main melody(wait till the last few stanzas for a real harmony surprise), it wins the listener over, dynamically it spares no effort with its complementary percussion and sound effects. It is indeed more emphatic in its percussion and short syllables in Loxian, compared to the Latin `Cursum Perficio'. It easily passes off as a 21st Century track meant for the dance hall, with its pounding resemblance to techno and fast paced chanting, but its artfulness are many notches above plain electronica or techno. This catchy tune will have listeners put this song on repeat quite a fair bit. It harks back to the relentless percussion work in `Storms in Africa', `Book Of Days' and `Ebudae'. Lyrically, if one read the English equivalent of the fictional Loxian language, it is typical Roma Ryan style. Questions, sometimes repeated phrases, the themes of distance, space and eternity.     LONG LONG JOURNEY  I was smitten at first listen, just like the previous track. Radio friendly length, catchy hook, a pop track with the flavour of a hymn, it wins even a casual listener over. If ever there is a complaint that I have, it will be the small vocalised bit between stanzas. They should have been infused with lyrics or lyrical sighs. The snare drums and its soaring chorus lends it an epic-like feel. The little vocalisation at the end, is just perfect!     SUMIREGUSA(Wild Violet)  Originally made as a commissioned song for Japan's Panasonic Corporation, first previewed as a streaming audio track at [...] the previewed version was much shorter, just a teaser. This full length version captures the hidden main course, that delights. I am particularly intrigued by the echoes at thebridge before the elongated sighs and the final stanza. Although based on the techniques first employed in `La Sonadora' and later in `Isobella', `Sumiregusa' stands on its own with its own personality.     SOMEONE SAID GOODBYE  The start hints at a melancholy song, but it changes tack swiftly enough. Delivered with a slap happy pace of `One By One', `Someone Said Goodbye' can easily be `One By One(Part2)', in terms of theme & synthesised strings. Once again, if there ever is any complaint, it's the vocalised portion that can do with a little extra lyrics. Hooky chorus, it's a pop track with the Enya signature sound and delivery.     A MOMENT LOST   It has the hymn influence of `Once You Had Gold' with the poignancy of `Fallen Embers'. If there's ever sweetness in melancholy, then `A Moment Lost' is it. Arguably the best non typical radio hit material on the album, it holds up to repeated listen, with its achingly beautiful melody and heartfelt rendition. Anyone who has ever said a word in anger to another or anyone who has lost/hurt or been hurt by someone you care about will be able to relate to it.     DRIFTING  The spirit drifts in a dreamlike trance. Appreciated according to the track order, `Drifting' is a good break between the intensity of `A Moment Lost' and the wistfulness of `Amid the Falling Snow'. It may not receive the appreciation that it should, partly because the overall brilliance of the other tracks outshine it. On its own it is a decent enough Enya instrumental, far more superior than the repetitive `The Promise'.     AMID THE FALLING SNOW  It captures a private wistful moment of recollection. In the snow and moonlight glow, thoughts return to winters past. It can easily pass off as a Christmas song, melody wise and lyrically. Those watching the fireplace in the cold of winter and those watching the falling snow from their rooms on a moon swept winter night , can easily relate to this piece.     WATER SHOWS THE HIDDEN HEART  An epic story delivered in fictional Loxian language, in the style of a choral hymn. This is just the type of instrumental and voices track that Enya must've envisioned on making from the early days of her career. It's complexity rivals `The Memory of Trees', while the melodic harmonies achieved here make Enya's early pieces of the same genre, although beautiful, elementary compared to this feast of sounds. Listening to this piece lifts the spirit. The album ends on a high note.     For the casual listener if you are not a fan, this album is recommended. If you are already an Enya fan, there is every reason to buy this album.   As a fan I considered `The Memory of Trees' as a superb album despite the release of `Paint the Sky With Stars'. When `A Day Without Rain' was released, in my heart's judgement I consider it equal to `The Memory of Trees'. With `Amarantine', Enya has outdone herself, at a time when people were wondering if Enya could top the exquisiteness of her own composition, `May It Be'.
B0000TLA9G|4.0|This CD is an excellent hits CD.  It includes all of the \\"must have\\" songs for the casual GnR fan.  Some will be disappointed that this CD isn't a mere repackaging of Appetite for Destruction, and that much of the album is taken up by some of GnRs comparatively quiet stuff, if you're buying this because you like \\"Welcome to the Jungle,\\" go with Appetite for Destruction instead. <br /> <br />This is a great introduction to GnR for those who are curious, and is also a great collection for the casual \\"yeah, I like Sweet Child of Mine\\" type fan.
B000BJS4SU|5.0|Excellent CD.  Mayer finally utilizes his outstanding guitar skills on this album.  Excellent choice by him to ditch the poppy scene and go to the rock/blues.  I feel this cd really fits his playing style and hopefully he will stick to music like this for now on.
B000006TRV|1.0|......who knew \\"Romper Room\\" with a splash of petty anger could be so awful???  Pink Floyd's \\"Wall\\" album reminds us all why we're so glad the 20th century is over.  Mundane and myopic testaments to boredom mix with crappy musicianship to produce this, the largest pile of art-rock crap ever produced.  I don't know about you, but Color Me Badd sounds pretty good right now.  I'd rather hear Henry Kissinger recite the periodic table of elements.
B000002JOH|5.0|Pantera was and always will be an influence in metal, especially that of guitarist Dimebag Darrell. His guitar skills are immensely a huge part of the genre, and VULGAR DISPLAY OF POWER was one of his finest crafts. Along with brother/drummer Vinnie Paul, bassist Rex Brown, and vocalist Phil Anselmo, Pantera truly broke out with this masterpiece of metal. Right from the start all the way through the end, Pantera makes metal the right way...and VULGAR was a huge influence for subsequent bands and many genre enthusiasts.  <br /> <br />\\"Mouth For War\\" is Pantera's ultimate message of \\"don't f**k with me\\" attitude, a heavy slab of Dime's loud guitar shreds and Vinnie and Rex's amazing rhythm section. All of this is a foundation for Anselmo to spit out his vocal venom, his messages of lost love, breaking out, and strength beyond strength. \\"Walk\\" is one of the best songs on the album, a militaristic kind of groove with smart lyrics and a very memorable chorus. Who could not sing along to lines like \\"Re! Spect! Walk! What did ya say?\\". But even as brutal as VULGAR DISPLAY OF POWER is, Pantera does show melodic chops once in a while. <br /> <br />\\"This Love\\" is arguably the best song on the album, a tale of broken love where Anselmo's gripping vocals take on Dimebag's melodic guitar verses before the explosive chorus, and the last half of the song is brilliant, every minute of it's 6:32 run time. Other strong tracks include \\"F***ing Hostile\\", a brutal fast, speed metal-ish attack. \\"By Demons Be Driven\\" is haunting metal, and \\"Hollow\\" is a strong closer to an album that's already beyond the strongest metal albums out there. <br /> <br />Pantera's influence will be felt for years to come, and Dimebag's style of guitar will remain an ever-present force in the metal genre. Boasting huge, loud riffs with pummeling, crushing rhythms and Anselmo's anguished and barking vocals, VULGAR DISPLAY OF POWER is hands down one of the most classic metal albums ever created...and a testamentto the influence and power of Pantera's music.
B000BMSTMS|4.0|EDIT: I take back everything in this I said. I just recently found out they wrote none of the album. It might be a hoax, but keep in mind the rumor is that the same people that write for Avril Laveign or however the hell you spell her name, wrote this album.<br /><br />I'm not too sure on giving this 4 or 3. I gave it 4 only for the fact that this CD is a huge step from the past two horrible albums. Untouchables was a HUGE let down, and Take a Look in the Mirror was  just a conclusion to my choice that they are old and busted. Don't get me wrong, some songs off Untouchable, maybe 2, were awesome. Really good songs. And about 1 song from TALITM was good. I had almost given up hope. I guess a little of my old Korn fandom still kindled some sort of flame in my mind for them. After TALITM, they released a Best Of and that, kids, is a SURE sign of them selling the farm. I figured they would realese a cd or two more, and then call it quits. But then, Head left the band to find God, and that was it for me. I knew they were over. Then this little number called Twisted Transistor comes out. Not too shabby, I thought. And then, yesterday, I came across the new album. I had no idea it was out. So, here we go. Knowing my state of mind for the past two albums, here we go.<br /><br />See You On the Other Side is meh. That is all I can say. It BLOWS the last two cd's out of the picture. Do not quote me on this, but I somehow remember reading that the band quit drinking sometime after Issues or Follow the Leader due to having children. Thus, their music sucked. And just yesterday I was reading that they are drinking again. Thus, new cd is good. Don't hate me, but when Jon Davis was drunk, and wrote angry/sad lyrics, they felt that way. You felt that stuff happend to you, and everything he was saying felt justifued. But when he wasn't tanked, and tried to write something angry or sad, it just came out sounding like what you would get if you asked Chris Martin from Coldplay to write a song about raping children and killing people. It just wouldn't work. So the last 2 cd's didn't. But this one did. If I went back, and re-listened to older Korn, I would defenatly go out and buy this cd. But since I haven't, I have only borrowed it thus far. I think their is a total of 14 tracks. And they are all pretty good save about 3 or so. This album is awesome, and I really would tell you to get it. I defenetly will be buying.a song about raping children and killing people. It just wouldn't work. So the last 2 cd's didn't.

B00003CX9E|5.0|Citizen Kane is one of the best movies I've seen.  I don't, however, say this because of its value in film making history, or any other such nonsense.  I am not really a film scholar, so I have to admit that many of the subtleties of the camera angling, etc, went right by me unnoticed, and I'm glad for that. <br /> <br />This movies excellence is because of its story, and the way it is told.  It cleverly goes through the story of Mr. Kane, as a young boy, up until his death, while only including necessary scenes.  It shows how Kane's desire to be loved brings him success, but in the end is his downfall, and does so elegantly. <br /> <br />The movie moves quickly, which is especially nice compared to many other movies of the time, and is interesting without requiring attention grabbing stunts to keep it so.  The acting in this movie is also excellent.  I love Orson Wells.
B0007MWZEK|1.0|I liked the sweeper until the battery died after just 4 months. Won't hold a charge. Would cost about $25 to replace. That's 1/2 of what I paid for the whole unit, and no guaranty the new battery will work any better. The sweeper would be great if they put a little more quality into it. DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK!!!
B000002I25|1.0|...this album demonstrates what happens when a public school education meets hallicinogens.  \\"The End\\" is a mindless rant that wouldn't make the cut on \\"The Wiggles\\", and \\"The Crystal Ship\\" is Cha-chi on pot!!!  The 60's were a whacked-out era, and this piece of solid gold crap is a time-machine to the scene of the crime.  If I really wanted a good laugh, I would have bought \\"Minnie Pearl does Devo\\", but at least then I would have known what I was getting.  This album offers no such luxury!!!
B000002JNJ|5.0|Ah, the mighty Pantera's first album...a breathtaking and heavy-as-hell glimpse into the very successful future of Pantera. It was albums like this that brought renewed faith in the metal genre, and gave metal fans a new voice. One listen to Dimebag's guitar, Vinnie's drums, Rex's bass, and Phil Anselmo's mighty vocals and you'll never look back. This is great stuff from the Texan boys, and you'll never guess that Pantera was once glam rock before they created this near-masterpiece. <br /> <br />First of all, all seven minutes of \\"Cemetary Gates\\" are absolutely brutal, beautiful, and melodic. The way Phil's voice matches the guitar in the last minute of the song was and still is amazing. It's a shame he couldn't keep doing that, but \\"Gates\\" is worth it for that part alone. Also, the classic title track is a heavy metal machine, metal at its finest. The solo Dimebag shreds in \\"Heresy\\" is memorable to say the least, complimenting an already strong track. You also have the crushing \\"The Art of Shredding\\" and the Vinnie Paul show of \\"Psycho Holiday\\". Plus, who could forget the bark of \\"Primal Concrete Sledge\\"? All throughout COWBOYS FROM HELL, Pantera shows their metal muscles and creative spark that truly dominated most of their work.  <br /> <br />So for the Pantera fan, this was the place you started. Housing some impressive musicianship from brothers Vinnie and Dime, and Phil's broad vocal range, this album is near-classic Pantera in every way. This is a good place to start if you have yet to discover Pantera, but longtime fans should know this by now. A definite recommend to any metal fan.
B000002KIE|3.0|Lemme set the record straight here. The Pistols weren't supposed to be good. They were angry punks of the mid 70's, the worst kind. And Sid? He couldn't play. Great stage presence, but the guy couldn't hit a note. Steve Jones was somewhat talented. Johnny Rotten couldn't sing, but hey, punk could never sing. This record is considered the punk template because of what it achieved, not what's in it. Although God Save the Queen and Anarchy are interesting songs, its all about Shock Value! The Pistols were the 70's equivalent of Marilyn Manson, and the music should be seen as such. Although The Clash achieved more and were better musicians, just take a listen to this for a reality check as to what punk really was like in the 70's.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I don't really consider myself a diehard Green Day fan. This is the only cd I own by them and I normally would have passed this one by but I since it has received such praise and since most places have it on sale I figured I would give it a shot. I can't tell you if Green Day sold out or not but what I can say is that this cd really wowed me. Now, I was already a bit sick of the radio hits before I bought the cd since they are played so frequently anyway but its the songs on here that haven't received radio time that make this album so great. Jesus of Suburbia is definitely my favorite and the rest are also quite good. If you like any of the singles that have already been played to death, be sure to give this album a try, its the other songs on here that will have you hooked.
0140182829|5.0|I'm sorry to be one of those who saw the movie first, but I did see both The Magus and The Wanderer at the Nugget - at our college town theater in 1969. Neither have appeared on DVD, which is a shame and a mystery. When and if you get a chance to see the film versions, they will not disappoint! I actually went back the next night to see each of these films again, and now, I must sit with the books and wait. <br /> <br />Until reading these reviews I did not know of the connection between the two, which makes the fascination I experienced and memories kept all these years even more valid. <br /> <br />Perhaps a stunning Candace Bergen at age 22 would not impress you in the main role, but Anthony Quinn had what I will deem his second best role (after Zorba) as The Magus. <br /> <br />Another \\"go figure\\" quandary as to why magical intelligent films are not reaching the KMART crowds....
B000003TA4|1.0|How long do we need to be subjected to the drug-crazed rantings of this bedwetter?  Kurt Cobain is jack-assery personified!!!  The music is simplistic...the singing is ridiculously awful...and the lyrics are something out of Marcia Brady's diary!!!  On a scale of one to ten, this registers a 0.2.  If Cobain really is the spokesman for his generation, I'm moving to the 1860's!!!
0140177396|4.0|Of Mice and Men was a very good book in my opinion. I liked it because it was about two guys pursuing a dream. George is a very smart person who knows what he wants out of life. Lennie on the other hand isn't very smart and gets into trouble alot. George basically take cares of Lennie and trys to keep him out of trouble. They both start working on a ranch in California and try to earn money so they can have there own place with a few acres. The ending is very good and unexpected that is what makes this novel great.
0385512058|4.0|Never Eat Alone, is a must read. It is a bold attempt to help businesses and individuals, to leverage the power of network and associations. The concept and benefits are explained elaborately with adequate examples. Keith uses his own life and many other examples. Each example is interesting and accenuates the point being made<br /><br />There are a few instances where it may be seem contradicting - like when Keith mentions of how one needs to be embodiment of true generousity and at the same time, take advantage of each relationship and association. This is a fine balance, and I read through the book, I did start appreciating this \\"unique duality\\".<br /><br />Must read! 'Notes'worthy too...
B00005JOFO|5.0|It shouldn't surprise anyone that the opening weekend in San Francisco was completely sold out for this much anticipated film. I just read the brief, wondrous novella by Annie Proulx a couple of weeks ago, and despite its wellspring of emotion, the 55-page book didn't seem like a natural candidate for screen treatment, especially one with a running time of 134 minutes. What is most intriguing about director Ang Lee's 2005 cinematic adaptation is how it builds upon the elliptical nature of Proulx's narrative into something quite transcendent and relevant beyond urban, flavor-of-the-month movie audiences.<br /><br />Thanks primarily to an extremely perceptive screenplay by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana, the much-discussed gay romance is not what separates this film from others but rather the penetrating depiction of the barriers that keep the two cowboys apart. As Lee has proven in previous films that go beyond his cultural identity, he can take what seems to be a niche subject and turn it into a love story with universal appeal to anyone facing an inhospitable environment. I join the chorus who feels it would be shame if potential viewers skip this movie on the preconceived and misbegotten notion that it is simply  a \\"gay cowboy\\" romance.<br /><br />Initially set on the mountain of the movie's title in Wyoming, the plot focuses on taciturn ranch hand Ennis Del Mar and animated bull-rider Jack Twist, both hired for low wages to herd sheep during the summer of 1963. One cold night, after we see several scenes where they get to know each other and acclimate themselves to their roles, they enter reluctantly into a passionate tryst. While the more open-minded Jack is excited by the feeling of liberation, Ennis is steadfast in his self-inflicted shame and rejects Jack's dream to own a ranch together. Having witnessed as a child the remains of a man lynched for carrying on a gay relationship, Ennis is afraid of the same fate. However, they both recognize an intractable bond that they try to ignore with great futility.<br /><br />Four years elapse, during which time both get married and have children. Ennis marries longtime sweetheart Alma and raises two daughters. Jack has since moved to Texas and married Lureen, the daughter of a big-time farm equipment dealer. He decides to come back and visit Ennis, and their pent-up passion is sparked and becomes unbridled. They begin to take romantic getaways together for the next two decades under the guise of fishing trips. A twist of fate brings Ennis an open resignation to his unresolved feelings even as his now-grown up daughter attempts to get to know him.<br /><br />The performances are uniformly strong. Jake Gyllenhaal portrays Jack in his familiar, wide-eyed manner since it fits his character's more idealistic personality, though he becomes marginally less convincing when he ages. As the wives, both actresses are removing the shackles of previously limiting roles. A graduate of the TV teen-angst soap opera, \\"Dawson's Creek\\", Michelle Williams continues the promise she showed in Thomas McCarthy's \\"The Station Agent\\" by revealing the increasing pain and unrelenting sadness in Alma, alternately realizing and denying what is going on between Jack and her husband. Anne Hathaway seems to be jettisoning her goody image from Garry Marshall's \\"The Princess Diaries\\" in a hurry as Lureen - first as a feisty rodeo girl not afraid to get sexually aggressive with Jack and then in a series of unfortunate blond wigs (from Farrah to Loni Anderson), as a savvy businesswoman growing indifferent to her husband's lack of attention. It's the smallest, least developed part of the four principals, but she makes her moments count.<br /><br />However, it is Heath Ledger who amazes as Ennis. This heretofore almost strictly commercial actor has tapped deeply into the agony of his character's soul with authentic force and poignancy. It's a career-defining performance of a man who cannot let his internal stirringsaffect his outward appearance. It's Ledger who makes the intimate scenes between Ennis and Jack seem so desperately charged with emotion and regret. Smaller roles are filled expertly - Randy Quaid as the suspicious sheepherder boss; Linda Cardellini - completely unrecognizable as bespectacled Velma from the \\"Scooby Doo\\" movies - as the waitress who tries hard to bring out Ennis' heart; and Kate Mara as Ennis's loving daughter. The panoramic vistas of Wyoming (actually Canada) are provided by Rodrigo Prieto's stunning cinematography, and the evocative music score is by Gustavo Santaolalla, who did similarly stellar work in Walter Salles's \\"The Motorcycle Diaries\\".  I am hopeful there is a broader audience than the enraptured critics, as the rest of us are also being rewarded with a superbly executed film.er who makes the intimate scenes between Ennis and Jack seem so desperately charged with emotion and regret.

B000002J09|2.0|Bob Plant sounds like a neutered gibbon, and Jim Page's guitar moans like Nero's eunich \\"wife.\\"  Add these two to a dash of stoned Bela Lugosi and you get Led Zeppelin 4.  The results are predictably disastrous, but they make anything by Pink Floyd sound like Beethoven's Fifth.  As a result, they get 2 stars.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I recently Rented all 6 DVD's with The 10 Episodes on it , and i was very impressed. The 10 Hour Miniseries was everything you could hope for. Hitting every aspect of the 2nd World War. Every Episode makes you love the miniseries even more.I am very glad to have scene this miniseries , Dont Miss and DOnt miss the chance to own it at this 50% off price on Amazon.com , I know i wont. <br />Overall The 10 Hour Miniseries lives up to what everyone says about it  and that is pure excellence
B000BM6AVA|5.0|I have been listening to this album, and it's GREAT! SOAD continues to have their own unique identity, unlike most of the stupid bubblegum crap that surprisingly makes its way to the radio. <br />Hypnotize, like any of the SOAD albums, reminds us that there is real issues in this world that deserve recognition. But not only do they keep us informed through their music, they slip in some humor too. \\"She's Like Heroin\\" and \\"Vicinity of Obscenity\\" are great examples. My favorites are \\"Holy Mountains\\" \\"Hypnotize\\" \\"Kill Rock n' Roll\\" and \\"Soldier Side\\". It's hard to believe that some people rated this CD poorly. They are obviously not die-hard fans.
B0009VRHLK|1.0|This is possibly the most awful movie I've seen in years. The filming of my 30th birthday is a lot more entertaining.  <br /> <br />I just can't believe Gallo managed to con someone into giving him the money to shoot it. Mind you, it shouldn't have taken more than a few bucks to do the whole thing... <br /> <br />Pretty bad. And to those who gave this 'thing' 4 or even 5 stars: 'Folks, please stop trying to see any artistic value in this pile of brown'.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I had seen Joss Whedon's TV show Firefly on TV, and liked it enough to by it on DVD. When I heard they were making a movie of it, I was ecstatic. <br /> <br />Usually a movie to which one has built up such excitement for disapoints, you exit the theatere becouse the movie did not meet your expectation. <br /> <br />Serenity took my expectations, and did things I could ahve never wished for. Instead of merely answering questions raised by the show, the movie twisted and turned any \\"facts\\" it told the audiance until no one in the theatere could say with a straight face they werent shocked. I was bowled over.  <br /> <br />I shant give away anything, that would ruin the film, but JOss whedon came up with an incredibly creepy, myterious, and downright facinating place for the heros to go to that weve never seen before. <br /> <br />Also, dont worry about if you havent seen the show this is based on, my mother hadnt and she enjoyed the film just as much as me. Make sure to look for David Krumholtz (from \\"Numb3rs\\" and \\"Ray\\") as Mr.Universe... A very funny man... and on that note, I will finish off by saying, its really incredible that this movie is both Scary, Funny, Noir, and action packed, with out ever getting silly, stupid, loosing its characters, or having a boring scene.  <br />Make sure you use the bathroom before this one, you wont want to get up.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|my friend had this album playing in his car.....even after a week it just wouldnt go out of my head.  after searching on the internet for forever (i had no idea who it was)  i finally found it.  now everynight i go to bed listening to it.  i just love it!!!
B00097DX3U|4.0|errrr.... sorry I know people are getting tierd of hearing this, but it's the honsest truth, RATM was atleast 40 times better than this band, and this band is not all that bad in the first place.<br /><br />I would recomend some Rage, which is more hardcore, if you like light music, fine, but i am telling you, rage is where it is at.
B000AP04FG|1.0|With two of the biggest stars in Hollywood today headlining the movie, I expected much much more. The plot lacked continuity and made very little sense. There was no chemistry between them, which seemed odd considering their off screen relationship. This was just a real disappointment from start to finish. Sequel? Let's hope not.
B0006FNFCE|5.0|This special version of Michael Buble's first album is a real treat.  The disc has been enhanced to include behind-the-scenes footage to go together with great sound quality as can be expected from a David Foster/Humberto Gattica piece of work and the extra disc of 5 X'mas tracks is an extra bonus.  Buble's rendition of older tracks (\\"Fever\\") and newer ones (\\"Kissing a Fool\\") are all great arrangements which don't take away from the originals.  In fact, in the case of \\"How Can You Mend a Broken Heart\\", Barry Gibb himself does the background vocals.  My favourite tracks here are \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\", \\"You'll Never Find Another Love Like Mine\\" (the old Lou Rawls' hit)and the old Van Morrison standard, \\"Moondance\\".  The album is packaged in a cardboard digipak design and includes a fold out poster with the track listings and performance credits on the reverse side.  Although Michael's performance on the X'mas disc isn't quite as good as it is on the first side (sounds a little rushed), overall, this is a great album and all swing lovers should get this version of the disc.  Great voice, great production, great packaging and design, what more can you ask for?
B00005ATZT|3.0|Janssen was actually an actor of very limited acting ability. He was  also drunken and self-absorbed and this all got wrongly mistaken for a man deep in thought as he was on the run from the law (as Kimble was supposed to be). The Fugitive series could suffer violently in watching it rerun as Janssen's obviously highly limited acting talent makes all the eps seem way too much alike. Harrison Ford OTOH is an actor of far greater emotional range. He could have perfectly played Kimble on a weekly tv series and been 5 times more interesting than Janssen had ever been. Ford also has greater energy than Janssen ever did. This makes Ford a great screen presence.
B00005JO1P|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have EVER seen.  The acting was amazing and touching.  The singing was astonishingly good.  Reese was amazing, but Joaquin should and MUST win an Oscar for Best Actor!!!!
B000002GFT|5.0|My older brother used to play this record, way back when there were records.I always thrilled to the sound of \\"Tam Lin.\\" And now, many years later, I still do. Lately, I've gotten into collecting other versions, but this is still the original sound of that music for me.
B00000J7A2|5.0|Of the 19 tracks here there's one (\\"I'm Glad\\") that does nothing for me, and a couple others that are merely okay.  Nonetheless I don't see where I can go lower than 5 stars, as I've listed to this repeatedly (perhaps obsessively) since I picked it up.  Many of the tracks are lively, bluesy jams with satisfyingly gravelly (though mostly indecipherable) vocals by Beefheart.  If Wolfman Jack could sing it might sound a little like this.  The first 12 songs were on the original album when released in 1967.  The remaining 7 tracks were added for the CD release and are outtakes or \\"unfinished\\" songs, some without vocals (I guess the vocals would have been added later had the songs ever been polished up).  But I find these bonus songs to be just as good as the first 12.  After repeated listens I noticed that there is more variety here from song to song than I realized at first.. a little pop, a little.. I dunno, maybe psychadelia is the right word?  Most of the tunes are also, to varying degrees, odd.  Unexpected shifts in tempo and mood within individual songs, unusual drumming, sound effects and musical instruments that I can't quite identify..  I find this interesting.  I understand this was just the tip of the iceberg for Beefheart, who immersed himself completely in musically bizarre waters just a couple years later.  Entertaining and addictive.
B000060MWU|5.0|I'm surprised to see a lack of comments about surrealism, in regard to this and other Lynchfilms. What are Lynch's influences? I'm telling you he deeply appreciated the surrealist films of Bunuel. So, if you want to understand Lynch and surrealism, look into the topic of surrealism, and watch other surrealist films. (I haven't seen this particular version- is it the new 5.1 <br />Universal release?) Through surrealism, Lynch makes vague murky powers <br />more tangible, more concrete. Who takes a closer look at good and evil?

B0006284JQ|1.0|She's been releasing records for only six years and already has a Greatest Hits record??? oh so contrived.
B000BVD460|3.0|Eminem delivers \\"Curtain Call\\" (2005), a seventeen-track release, which contains twelve tracks from his previous albums; an intro, three new cuts and one live one. The three new tracks are \\"Fack\\", \\"Shake That\\" feat. Nate Dogg and \\"When I Am Gone\\". The first two of these are sub par cuts, the kind that made this reviewer hit skip as fast as he could. \\"When I Am Gone\\" is a quality track though and a good addition to this release, Eminem drops some very real lyrics about his life, while delivering his own outstanding chorus. I did not think much of Eminem much-heralded \\"Stan\\" duet with Elton John, this grammy collab is included. The older material contains a number of great Eminem tracks; some of my personal favourites are \\"The Way I Am\\", the original \\"Stan\\" feat. Dido, the amazing \\"Lose Yourself\\", impressive \\"Sing For Me\\" and heartfelt \\"Mockingbird\\". \\"Like Toy Soldiers\\" and Eminems personal dedication to his mom \\"Cleaning Out My Closet\\" is also well placed on this release. People reading this review will notice I left out a number of tracks when mentioning favourites, in all honesty tracks like \\"My Name Is\\", \\"The Real Slim Shady\\" and \\"Just Lose It\\" never had an appeal to me (no matter how many thousand times I heard them on the radio). I think everyone who enjoyed some of Eminems music would probably have a different listing of what tracks he or she wants on this. Those who love his music can look out for some new verses on a track called \\"The Most Shady\\" which will be on the upcoming Biggie Duet album. In a world where music is easily downloadable, I think artists should take things to a new level when providing releases such as this. I personally think greatest hits albums (if this is what it was supposed to be) should be a minimum two-disc release, jammed with the maximum amount of classic music (known hits, slept on hits) from that artist. People deserve more bang for their buck. Still this release will put a smile on many an Eminem fans face. 3.5.

B000BVEKO0|5.0|Korn has a history of putting out incredible rock albums and 'See You On The Other Side' is no different. They have mixed up their sound and came up with something unlike any of their other albums. From their anti-political song titled, what else but \\"Politics\\" to their slower, yet powerful song \\"Tearjerker\\" to their hit first single \\"Twisted Transistor\\" this album is a must for any Korn fan. But, this album is not just for those who have been with Korn through the years, I would also highly recommend it to those out there who have only heard a few Korn songs or even those who haven't heard the captivating music of Korn. This album is sure to be a favorite among your collection. But don't take my word for it, you can pick up your copy here at Amazon.com now!
B000B8QEZG|1.0|DO NOT...i repeat: DO NOT buy this cd if you have any real appreciation for good music! I saw the video for \\"hung up\\" and it was hypnotic and catchy. I loved it. I am a huge fan of synth and electronica of all sorts and I was pretty jazzed when I heard the single with its very electro style. I still love \\"hung up\\" but the rest of the cd is utter trash. I am not usually some one who needs really powerful lyrics to like a song (although it's always a plus). But in this case, the lyrics are so shallow and vapid that they just can't be ignored. The music for the rest of the songs is not near catchy enough to overcome their shortcomings. I was thoroughly disappointed with this cd and i strongly suggest anyone to think twice before purchasing this cd.
B000BMSTMS|5.0|Korn has a reputation for putting out incredible albums and 'SEE YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE' is no different. After the departure of their guitarist, Head, Korn wanted to make an album that was different from anything they had done before. So with the help of some new producers Korn went into the studio and recorded yet another captivating, thought provoking, and truely awesome album. From their anti-political song, titled what else but \\"Politics,\\" to their slower, yet powerful song \\"Tearjerker,\\" to their popular first single \\"Twisted Transistor\\" this album is full of an assortment of songs any Korn fan is sure to appreciate. I personally like the song \\"Coming Undone,\\" it reminds me of the older Korn albums yet has the different sound that is apparent throughout the album. I would recommend this album not only to those who have been with Korn throughtout the years but also to those who would like to find out about the music of Korn.
B000BGH22W|5.0|First off, I would like to say that John Williams did a wonderful job writing the score for the first three Harry Potter movies. But the soundtrack for The Goblet of Fire is absolutely outstanding. The music is much darker than the earlier films, as it is a darker movie. Patrick Doyle does an outstanding job keeping the eerie scenes light and mysterious, and the darker, scarier scenes much heavier. I really enjoyed listening to the new theme of darker music compared to the earlier movies. Doyle does an absolutely wonderful job; I really can't say enough. My only complaint is of the last three tracks on the CD. They are really heavy rocker songs and I just could not get the feel for them. Half of the time the lyrics don't even make sense. I cannot understand why they would put those songs on this soundtrack. But, overall I really enjoyed this soundtrack and give it 5 stars.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|I didn't even know that Cream reunited and performed this past May...well anyway...I saw this performance on PBS last week and was like \\"Wow,this is great\\"! A reunited Cream! ....Eric Clapton poured his heart and soul in this performance ,not that he doesn't with other live shows,but I think he really wanted to give that extra 'umph\\" to this one. ....Jack Bruce still noodles on that bass,plays the harmonica and provides that trademark throaty blues voice that Cream is well known for. .....Ginger Baker,the oldest of the three at 65, is really enthusiastic about this reunion and plays with alot of energy that you wouldn't expect a 65 year old man to have.   ......If your expecting a rock show with lots of pyrotechnics,lights and hoopla that comes with it, you're gonna be disappointed.. THIS IS A BLUES PERFORMACE!!  No frills, just jamming .....They went on stage and basically started playing \\"I'm So Glad\\" and continued.  This DVD is the same way,when you pop it in,BOOM..right to the show....no junk or advertising that you end up skipping through. The main menu offers alternate takes of a couple songs on both discs and disc 2 offers an interview that is definately worth watching.  ......a very humble reunion ...not 'hey look at us,were back'....An awsome performance by a great blues trio.
B00005JOFO|5.0|This movie is about a love affair between two ranch hands in 1963 Wyoming.  They take jobs watching over sheep up on Brokeback Mountain.  Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) are the two.  There's not a lot of dialogue in the beginning between them, but there is a chemistry that is obvious to all.  After a night of drinking, Ennis decides he can't make it back to check the sheep so he decides to sleep it off there outside of Jack's tent.  Ennis begins to audibly shiver as the cold of the night sets in.  Jack hearing this invites him in to his tent.  Later on as Jack awakes after pulling Ennis' hand around himself, they both are a bit uncomfortable at first but Jack then takes the initiative and they end up having sex.  After that neither one wants to speak too much about it but they have this understanding.  After the job is cut short due to the weather, at least that's what they are told, they split ways and end up leading their separate lives, both eventually getting married and having children.  They then continue their affair on a more frequent baisis over the years.  Each telling their wives they are going away with a fishing buddy.  That's the basic story.  I won't tell anymore.  I really recommend you see this film.  Chances are if you've taken the time to read this you will enjoy the film.      All the acting was amazing, but Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal were both outstanding.  I think it's time for some Oscars for this one.  The directing by Ang Lee was stellar as usual.  It is just a beautiful film.     I knew this was going to be a tragic love story from what I'd heard and even the previews gave it away.  So I decided to brace myself and try to enjoy it.  Well it left me in tears which a lot of movies do, but even more it has stayed with me.  I saw it about 6 hours ago and I'm still feeling down.  This is not a knock against the movie, in fact it explains how deeply moving the movie is.  It's going to make me enjoy my life andthe things I have a little more than I did yesterday.  I would imagine everyone will take a little something different from this movie but I think it will affect a lot of people, hopefully in a positive way.      Before I saw the movie I was talking to a friend who said they were saying on the radio that it's not a gay movie, but a \\"country\\" movie.  I'll admit the word gay was never uttered during the movie.  I think I understand what they are trying to say, but in my mind it was gay.  Don't get me wrong, not like \\"Torch Song Trilogy\\" (great movie), but let's face it, it's about two men in love in an age and a place where that was not an option.
B000006MS3|5.0|I don't really understand the problem people have with this album. To be honest I was very wary of buying this so it's one of the last of Kate's that I've bought simply because everyone says this album is difficult if not impossible to get into.     Maybe 20 odd years have mellowed the impression it gives, or maybe its just that after having listened to Radiohead's Kid A album that every album sounds \\"normal\\" after that, who knows. Either way, I took to it like a duck to water and I think it's wonderful I simply havn't been able to stop playing it for weeks now.    This album is brilliant and experimental and has influenced many artists over the years especially her friend Peter Gabriel, she creates highly original sonic landscapes and textures with unusual effects and sounds and all tied together with enough of a melody to keep your ears tuned to it complete with aboriginal sounds, uilean pipes, strange screams and even donkey braying which I have say still freaks me out! It may sound strange until your ears become attuned to it but once they do you'll realise how brilliant this album is it's an ultimately extremely rewarding experiance. It's something to be played loudly and alone and without any distractions or you'll miss it's myriad effects and highly original phrasing. Unlying it all however are simply 10 cracking good tunes.    If your listening extends no further than the Suga Babes and Madonna then you're probably wasting your time with this album. If on the other hand you're tired of the current run of pop \\"stars\\" where everybody sounds exactly like everybody else and you long to listen to something different, then give this album a try it may be just what you're looking for.    Utterly brilliant. I love it. Kate Bush is a genius. Theres no other way to describe it.
B000BVEKO0|5.0|Korn has definitely branched out on this album. So many different sounds yet there's no mistaking it's Korn. Love Song and Tearjerker have a dark, melodic feel to them. Hypocrites and Liar may have a message for a certain someone? Maybe. Coming Undone has great rhythm to it. The songs are all incredible. Amazing guitar work from Munky, David's best drumming yet, Fieldy's bass is sounding better than ever, and Jonathan's voice is still as hard as ever. I highly recommend adding this album to your collection!
B00097DX3U|4.0|This is better than their first release, which I also really like.  No, it's not RATM or Soundgarden.  It's different.  So get over it.
0895260131|5.0|As a non-religious person who objectively views Islamofascism as a much greater threat to Western civilization than say, Jerry Falwell, I find this book to be the PERFECT PRIMER for anyone with a shred of interest in current events. <br /> <br />It blows apart so many \\"multiculti PC myths\\" - too many to list here. And it's quite the easy read.  <br /> <br />Generally, there are three types of people that will dislike or ignore this book: Muslims unwilling to look in the mirror, Leftists that have long ago lost their minds to their multiculturalist hearts, and apathetc, ignorant folks (alas, the vast majority of us).   <br /> <br />If you know people who do not fall in these categories, pass this book on!  My girlfriend and father are next in the queue! <br /> <br />Highly recommended!  And thank you Robert Spencer for risking your life to write the truth. <br />
B000BMSTMS|4.0|I remember the old days of Korn, 'follow the leader', 'life is peachy', classic albums, but alas they are no more. <br />Gone are the quirky riffs, and almost 'strangled' feel of korn's old music, replaced by some seriously heavy tracks in this album. <br />If you like the sound of 'old' korn, maybe this album isn't for you, its very melodic, very heavy (pretty much the whole way through)and while some of the older tracks are subtle and almost whispered in places, now there's a lot more shouting and agression. <br />BIG DRUMS, BIG BASS, BIG GUITARS, and in my opinion one of Korn's best albums yet (second only to 'Issues'), just don't expect the sound of older korn tracks, the type of album you wouldn't expect your mother to like very much.
0140177396|4.0|Of mice and men was a great book. It told about how and little man named, George who was smart and a dumb man, Lennie who was really big and strong. This book explained how the one man helps out another guy that isnt smart at all and just needs taking caring of because his Aunt Clara died. Well while they both keep working on the fields Bucking Barley, they come up with an idea to own a house and a couple of acres. Well Lennie loves to rub soft things, so he wants to just get the house and tend the rabbits. The book is just a good book of how good of friends can work together and when something goes wrong a friend has to do the thing that is best for the other.
B000BC8STM|5.0|For those of you who notice how people are so drawn to this multi-faceted and talented star, this is the concert that tells you why. The show, shot in 1991 toward the end of her Heart Of Stone Tour, is the result and culmination of many years of hard work and reinvention. In her own eyes, Cher is always Cher, but the public perception of her has changed through the years, and it is easy to see that in retrospect. Throughout her 60's folk-rock era and subsequent nightclub act, from her transformation to Vogue model and TV variety star, then Vegas act and Disco diva, Cher persevered. But it was her 1980 stint as lead singer in a band, Black Rose, where the public was given a hint of what was truly inside this woman. The band was not a hit, but Cher's instinct to do full head-on Rock and Roll was. Combining that element with her knowledge of making a pop song her own is Cher's greatest gift.     So when it came time to record again after six years, after establishing true artistic credibility as an actress, she applied that same passion to turn out the hits, \\"I Found Someone\\", \\"We All Sleep Alone\\", \\"After All\\", and her now all-time classic \\"If I Could Turn Back Time\\", which was released right before the start of the tour in 1989. This DVD release is the CBS special that aired by tour's end.     All the extra tracks on the previously released VHS version appear on the DVD as Bonus Songs. You get everything, plus more. The extras are superb.    Among my favorite cover tracks are Eddie Money's \\"Hold On\\" (it wonderfully suits her vocal style), her rockin', sexy take on Greg Allman's \\"I'm No Angel\\", and the unforgettable gem \\"Many Rivers To Cross\\", which Cher sings as though she wrote it herself (she gave all of us in the audience chills when I first heard her sing it in Atlantic City - I heard her sing in a way I never heard - her true heart, soul and guts are in that song). That song, more than any other, demonstrates a Cher rarely heard on CD.     What is particularly special is that with the angle button on your DVD remote you can access different performances of the same song from various stages of her tour. You get some that show her in rehearsal before a private audience, and you get some showing clips from the beginning of the \\"Heart Of Stone Tour 89\\" before it became \\"Tour 90\\" (I saw both in person, and to my surprise, I was in attendance during one of the clips!). Cher had a hand in this DVD version, and what she gives here is a real treat for the collector.     As someone who met her three times, I remember the first time when I mentioned how I loved Black Rose, and that direction for her musically. With \\"Live At The Mirage\\" her vision is fully realized.     Even with her style changes in the late nineties - by that time Cher evolved into a Techno-Dance queen - it is hard to categorize her. Cher is a category unto herself. If you love the rock goddess, fear no more, for I predict the ultimate rock resurrection is soon to come.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|First off: \\"in fact, Godsmack takes its name from an AIC song\\". In fact, they didn't. <br /> <br />This album is on par with the previous two. If you liked the first two, you will probably like this one as well. I do hope they stay consistent and don't go Metallica on us. <br />

B00005JNTX|5.0|2005 has not been a banner year for movies, if I have to sit through one more super-hero movie I think I'm gonna puke. Between big Hollywood bombs and remake after remake, you can imagine the joy I received from watching this incredible movie. About as flawless as a movie can be this is film-making at it's best. I am not very familiar with Frank Miller and his 'graphic' novels, but I am very tempted to do some serious catching up with the man!!<br /><br />Have you ever seen a movie with so many a-list actors in your life? and here is what really surprised me, some of these actors generally make crappy movies (Brittany Murphy) but they all shine  here, big time. Bruce Willis and Mickey Rourke get the most screen time and both excell mightily, I'm sure it won't happen but some oscar consideration for best actor should be considered for either if not both. Willis is at his best as a cop with a bad heart feeling his age trying to do good by his one true love, Jessica Alba, who plays a stripper with a big heart. She also is great in this, and thank god, because she followed this with 'Fantastic 4' why Jessica, why? Mickey Rourke, who I have always enjoyed, even in some of his more poor movies, is just stunning here, he plays this so well, he makes sure you will be thinking of this character weeks after you've seen it. I have now seen this three times and his portrayal of a man fighting all kinds of inner demons, not to mention a serial killer and a corrupt priest  (played very well and very creepy by Rutger Hauer) is something I'll never forget.<br /><br />Clive Owen is 3rd in the depth chart, but what a job he does, and I think he needed this, it makes people forget he did the awful 'King Arthur' he plays a cop trying to save his lady from a real low-life of a man played brilliantly by Benicio Del Toro. I mean this man is such a total sleaze-bag, and Del Toro absolutely hams it up, I'm guessing he had a blast playing this role. Brittany Murphy, and I can't believe I'm going to say this, is pretty solid as Owen's girlfriend. This is the same woman who did 'Little Black Book' and 'Uptown Girls' so this was a welcome change, hopefully this will help her pick better roles in the future, cuz' she is very attractive and really not that bad of an actress.<br /><br />Moving on, some of the smaller roles are some of the best. Now this may seem strange to most, but I think Elijah Wood (yes, Frodo) should be nominated for Best Supporting Actor. He does not say a word, but his performance as the serial killer is down right scary. The facial expressions he uses are sinister and perfectly timed, you watch they way he \\"meets his maker\\" and tell me that didn't make the hair on your neck stand right up!!! Devon  Aki is Meho, another who does not say a word, but is enchanting, until she whips out of of her many weapons and does some really not so nice things to alot of bad men. This was followed by D.E.B.S. Devon.......again, why?<br /><br />Rosario Dawson is sexy as hell as Gail, one of Clive Owen's former flings, she too is a bad-ass and Nick Stahl is the son of senator Power's Boothe, both are scum-bags, but Stahl is just nasty, nasty, nasty. His scenes with Willis and Alba towards the end are sensational to say the least. Michael Madsen, Alexis Bledel, and Carla Gugino also co-star, and like I said earlier, all contribute in one way or another.<br /><br />My only tiny, and I mean very tiny, complaint is Michael Clarke Duncan, he is very unbelievable and his role lacked the edge and depth of every other character, so this is two poor showings in a row from him, as he was really bad in 'Daredevil' but no big deal as most of that movie was atrocious.<br /><br />Robert Rodriguez, for the most part, is a visually gifted director, he has a special way of showcasing violence in a stylized way that few can compare with.'Desperado' is one of my all time favorites and 'From Dusk Till Dawn' is one of the better horror vampire movies ever made. Although Ihave not seen any of the 'Spy Kids' movies, I know from there commercial success and with talking to alot of kids that atleast the first two are very well done. So it's a real shame that I recently heard that his latest kids fare, 'Adventures Of Sharkboy And Lavagirl' was such a flop.<br /><br />I can't say enough good things about this movie, it is hands down the best of the year, and I really hope it is not forgotten around academy awards season. This is expertly acted and directed, and is simply one of the best-looking movie's I can remember. I hear there is a new version coming out, with extended scenes and the infamous \\"not rated\\" tag.

B00028DOEE|3.0|I found this film enjoyable and fun to watch every christmas but it's not the greatest film. I found the film to long it draged on and on and the film is noisey and bussy. The make-up is really good. The acting is really good espesailly Jim Carrey. Overall it's a good film.

B000002UAR|3.0|This record wasn't the first \\"psychedelic\\" rock album, however The Beatles were really the first to use the studio as an instrument within itself. This is the ultimate problem with this album, well for me anyway. Tracks such as \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\", \\"Elenaor Rigby\\", \\"Love You To\\", etc were revolutionary for the time and are still incredibly effective, HOWEVER what about banal crap like the hideous \\"Good Day Sunshine\\" and \\"Got To Get You Into My Life\\"? These songs sound more like jingles for soda commericals and not the work of a serious artists. Can't people be honest and just admit they like catchy songs and don't really know that much about rock music. If you are looking for \\"real\\" psychedelia from 1966 check out what The Byrds, The 13th Elevators, The Deep, Donovan, The Yardbirds, Bob Dylan,The Misunderstood and The Mothers of Invention were doing.
B000929AJQ|5.0|this cd is exellent if your into this type of music.however seems like a drastic turn from everything else nine inch nails has created in the past. its more of a light rock type of sound. with a bit of a mix of different types of soungs in the concepts of listeng to both melow relaxing tunes as well as other songs that are more motivating. the guitar work on this album is very basic in the way that its more one of the follow up insterments.the main focus is mainly drumming and even base seems to pick up as the lead in many songs . trent reznor really has done a good job creating an album with a greate feel to it, im not usually one to focus to much attention on the lyrics spacificly but somthing about this album just makes the lyrics sound greate, wich is deffently important in terms of capturing the atmospere of this peice of work.  <br />i must add however that it took me a mounth or two to worm up to with teeth, but it is now one of my favourate albums.
B000AU9UYC|3.0|This was a fun movie in some respects, depressing in others.  Christian Bale was, of course, very good.   But what irks me the most, is that people in Hollyweird have to REVAMP everything.  Here's a few items:  1. Thomas & Martha take their kid to an opera. What the...? In the original books, it was the movie 'Mark of Zorro'. Who takes a kid to the opera?  2. Ra's Al Ghul becomes his mentor, then his enemy. Anyone familiar w/the comics KNOWS that Ghul comes in later in his career.   3. Bruce seems to get help from every direction. This flick turns him into a semi-co-dependant whiner (on occasion). Not the hard-as-nails, bootstrap, perfectionist, be-prepared-for-everything character we've all come to admire.   4. Lucius Fox becomes his armorer. And lo & behold! Everytime the hero needs a device, or armor, or even mobility, YIPPEE! Welcome to Comic Book Hero Convenience store, your 1-stop shopping for all your super-hero needs! Wonder if they've got a spare Green Lantern ring?  5. I dunno about anyone else, but I rather preferred Al Ghul as the eco-terrorist, rather than some existential nihilist (why on earth anyone would try to cure civilization's ills by destroying Gotham is anyone's guess: just another stupid revamp done by some ghost-writer on a coke binge, is my guess).  The fight scenes were very cool, the special effects outstanding. Katie Holmes not wearing a bra wasn't really eye candy for me (I'd prefer Jessica Alba or Halle Berry, m'self), since she's just cute, not all that great.   So I gave it a 3. Fun watch, but not more than once.   & I repeat: it ain't broke, don't fix it. Original storylines were great? Why rewrite the bleedin' thing?
0307276902|5.0|I am the mother of four sons, two of whom became addicted to Crack. One is still on the path to destruction and the other is \\"clean\\" and productive. He didn't do the 12 Step Program or AA. He did just what James Frey did; he said \\"no more\\". He went to rehab but left after a few days. He embarked on a job that kept him away from home, old friends and druggies, for over a year. He then moved to another state with his wife and kids and he has been clean for over two years and I believe he will stay clean. He has a good job and a beautiful new home. This book brought into my mind all that I have seen my boys go through; the realistic drug dreams, the life-style of druggies noted at the bus station and drug house, and the always present drive to \\"fill up\\" with something. I read this in one long sitting and can't wait to pass it along to friends and family.  I have been living with this in  my oldest son for over 20 years and have seen for myself all sides presented in this book. (He had a different father and his father is a long-time druggie. Although Frey doesn't believe in the genetics factor, I do!) This son has been in rehab and 12 step programs at least 20 times, to no avail.  A big A+ for a realistic perspective on the tragedy of addiction and the role of choice.
B00005JO04|4.0|And just go to see \\"Syriana\\" if you are interested in serious filmmanking.  Gaghan, a screenwriter from the movie \\"Traffic\\", gives us more of the same, set in the Middle East.  Oil permeates the film.  It oozes and flows, drawing the central symbol, greed...from everyone it touches.<br /><br />Drawn from the book by Robert Baer, \\"See No Evil: The True Story of a Ground Soldier in the CIA's War on Terrorism\\", Syriana makes a political statement of what can happen when America intervenes in the complicated beehive of middle east politics and leaders.  Ignore it.  Don't take sides, don't draw parallels.  Just see the movie for what it is and not what it tries to be.<br /><br />It is a series of harsh vignettes, made all the more real by the camera work.  It is a dark and brutal movie set in the Arabian sunshine.  It is full of a mix of characters (and phenomenal actors) and you can't always tell the good from the bad.<br /><br />There are parables - the young man (Matt Damon) blessed with a gift of precise analytics and believable soundbites, who chooses to dabble in an industry that is full of corruption, without being corrupted himself.  In the film he loses his innocence and nearly loses the family that is the anchor of what he really is.<br /><br />The road warrior (George Clooney) - who is the antithesis of what we think CIA operatives are, and who probably portrays them more closely to the truth of many agents.  He's driven by what he's seen after years in Iran, tainted by knowing too much and yet not enough, overweight and old, with nothing in his family life to compel him to get out of the way of disaster.  He's a used man, and he knows it, but he can't stop himself.  There is a scene of his torture in the film that is all too brutal, but it doesn't do what we think it will do....reform George into a force for good.  Instead, he is bound by his own need to play a part in the conclusion that leaves the filmgoer wondering if he achieved the outcome he sought, or if he was too late to change the outcome.<br /><br />There is the fixer - Jeffrey Wright as an attorney who is challenged to be a \\"lion not a lamb\\" as he investigates the complex series of events that leads up to a merger of oil companies.  The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act takes center stage here, and Wright finds himself in league with Chris Cooper, who is the reluctant bridegroom in the marriage.  Wright's character's family life is dominated by an alcoholic father, who keeps showing up inebriated on Wright's doorstep....a genteel reminder that he can't escape his past.<br /><br />There is the arresting presence of Alexander Siddig, as the visionary older prince, son of a powerful emir.  There is the return of Christopher Plummer, again, to the big screen, in a role in which he is deliciously villainous.<br /><br />Lastly, there is the story, all too worrisome, of the young Arab (I could not distinguish the name of the actor) who is living poorly as a stranger in a strange land, and whose vulnerability will ultimately lead him to terrorism.<br /><br />The movie is being compared to \\"Traffic\\", but it is not \\"Traffic\\"...it does not unite the audience, it leaves them puzzled.  It does not glorify its topic, but neither does it complete its agenda, if it has one; only leaves the viewer feeling uneasy and worried.  Perhaps that IS the agenda.  It is visually stunning, completely worthy of a view by someone who goes to the movies NOT to be entertained, but to be open to a new story.  It is far too ambitious for its boundaries.  And yet, it is fascinating and chilling, and definitely a slice of something different for this holiday film season.<br /><br />Just writing a review about this movie will leave the review open to a lot of votes that vote against the liberal lean of the film and want to deep six it. My review has nothing to do with the agenda; simply put, it lauds the unusual approach to filmmaking and the arresting visuals of the final product, along with somefine \\"small\\" performances by actors who are generally larger than life.<br /><br />Glad I saw it.  You might not feel the same.nal product, along with some fine \\"small\\" performances by actors who are generally larger than life. <br /> <br />Glad I saw it.  You might not feel the same.
0553801503|5.0|I don't know what the other critical reviews are trying to say but I think many are over looking more than a few aspects that this particular book is doing. For one it isn't the most exciting book of this wonderful series but it shows things that we don't here much about such as Dorne and the Iron Isles and even gives us glimses into other characters point of views that we heard about but never got much of what they're thinking. <br /> <br />Sure Brieene's character is kinda borring and long winded but hey I think that Arya and Cersie's chapters are very interesting. The only thing that dissapoints me is that we have to wait a year for the next book to pop up (I hope so).
B0001Z53AQ|5.0|Eminem and his crew do not follow the rules, that's obvious from song one of this album, and it's what makes them so unique.  Few bands in any genre do half as good a job mixing styles, blending humor and violence, stupidness and seriousness.  One minute they'll be singing about having sex with your gramma, and the next rapping about the death of a loved one, and the effect it had on them or something.  You can listen to this CD for hours and it will never get boring.  It contains the usually rap subjects: Drugs, violence, sex, but it gives it a new sound and flavor that sets it apart totally.  The beats, rhythm, and lyrics of literally track are incredible.  Em does a good job of keeping the rest of D12 in the spotlight (Even Bizarre, who in my opinion is the only weak member of the band), and only occasionally comes in to help.  Trust me, anyone who says this album is just another Eminem project with a different lable hasn't heard any of it. The only track that has more of him than any of the other guys is \\"Git Up\\", which has him singing both the chorus and a long verse, but it works because it grabs your attention. <br />   Literally every song on this album is good.  Tracks like \\"My Band\\" and \\"U R The One\\" keep up the siliness that made up most of \\"Devil's Night\\", while \\"How Come\\" and \\"Leave Dat Boy Alone\\" among others, keep the album real.  There is definitely a lot more seriousness in \\"D12 World\\" than in \\"DN\\", but it shows that they have matured a lot, and can rap meaningful lyrics along with comedy.  \\"Good Die Young\\" is one song that really showcases that.   <br />    To say that this is one of Eminem's best productions would be an understatement, being one of the most unique sounding rap albums I have heard in a long time.  Whether you love Em or hate him, this album is still for you.    You gotta get this. <br /> <br />    1. \\"Git Up\\" (4.5/5)- Nice flow, and an addicting chorus get the album off to a great start.  Eminem absolutely rips the first verse up. <br />    2. \\"Loyalty\\", feat Obie Trice (4/5)- Unique sound, great hook, puts Bizarre and Proof on for the first time.  Obie makes it sound even better. <br />    3. \\"Just Like You\\" (3/5)-Definitely one of the weaker tracks on the album, with Bizarre as the only artist.  Decent rapping, but still doesn't cut it. <br />    4. \\"I'll Be Damned\\" (4/5)- Good mix-up of all the members, good song. <br />    5. \\"Dude (Skit\\" (4/5)-A pretty funny skit, featuring D12 after a show. A good interlude. <br />    6. \\"My Band\\" (3.5/5)-Kinda funny, but gets old quickly with an annoying chorus.  Way too long. <br />    7. \\"U R The One\\" (4.5/5)- Good flow, different sound. <br />    8. \\"6 In The Morning\\" (5/5)- A great track, with the type of chorus D12 are known for. Great assistence from Em. <br />    9. \\"How Come\\" (5/5)- One of the best songs on the album, and one of the best verses I have ever heard from both Eminem and Kon Artist.  A great example of how much farther D12 has come from their last album. <br />    10. \\"Leave Dat Boy Alone\\" (5/5)- Addicting chorus, great flow from all the members.  Best track featuring Swift. <br />    11. \\"Get My Gun\\" (4/5)- Good song, a little too repetivive. <br />    12. \\"Bizarre (Skit)\\" (2/5)- Pointless.  The only really dumb skit. <br />    14. \\"B**ch\\" (4/5)- Nice sound, pretty funny. <br />    15. \\"Steve's Coffee House (Skit)\\" (5/5)- Hilarious!  <br />    16. \\"D12 World\\" (5/5)- Free-style type rapping, another great track. <br />    17. \\"40 Oz.\\" (5/5)- \\"Detroit Muthaf**ker!\\" One of the best sounding songs, crunk beats and chorus mixed with great rapping. <br />    18. \\"Commercial Break (Skit)\\" 5/5- The best skit. <br />    19. \\"American Psycho\\" 5/5- Best chorus on the CD.  D12 makes killing seem sweet and humorous. <br />    20. \\"Bugz 97\\" 5/5- Freestyle rapping from a late member who apparently had some real talent. <br />    21. \\"Good Die Young\\" 5/5- D12's first successful attempt at making a track that can really touch you.  Incredible lyrics, give the album a good closing. <br />    22. \\"Keep Talkin' (Bonus Track)\\" 4/5- Obsenity has never sounded so great.  Too short. <br /> <br />    Once again: Get this album! <br />
B0002UXBD6|5.0|Well, first of all I would like to point out that Green Day is one of my favorite bands, but that is not why I chose that this cd is really good.  <br />Green Day is an American made band that people of all ages love and I have yet to come across a person that does not like Green Day. As we all know Green Days 1994 album, \\"Dookie\\", was GREAT and I would agree that this album falls right under that one. Although \\"American Idiot\\" is almost a completly different sound from albums before, it fits with what people of all ages think today and the band has succesfully won many awards for their hard work on the album. <br />\\"American Idiot\\" is a really good CD, especially if you do not really favor how America is being run right now, hence the name \\"American Idiot\\". The band made an album that is politically correct and I think that President Bush should really listen to what Green Day has to say becuase many, many, many people feel the same way. Green Day has made the American people think about polotics because we have the power to choose how our government will be run, not the politicians. <br />Also, if your thinking \\"I'll just burn it\\", wrong thinking, I would highly recomend buying this cd.
0679422714|4.0|I think the tone of this tomb is stated accurately in the first sentence which I paraphrase \\"Mao was responsible for 70 million deaths.\\"  The rest of the book is a presentation of proof of this thesis.  From his early years to his marriages, neglect of his own children and constant machinations against everybody around him Mao is and was a tyrant of at least equal rank to Hitler and Stalin.  The millions of deaths for which he was responsible make any debate on who was worse comparable to argueing what is worth more 25 cents or a quarter.   <br /> <br />I think the great importance of this book is Jung Chang's ability to describe and document so many of the evil deeds accomplished by Mao and his accomplices.  Her exposing of great lies like Mao's Long March, on which he actually rode, is a great service not just to history but to the prevention of such tyranny in the future.   <br /> <br />The strident reactions of other reviewers to Ms. Chang shows just how deeply she challenges their commonly held believes and how hard it is for them to deal with truth. Mao was a criminal (as I said) he was a tyrant, he was evil and China is not better off because of him.  To say so is to say Mussolini kept the trains running and Hitler helped modernize Germnay so their countries were better off after them.  To say so is to minimize the value of human life and to allow that it is ok to sacrifice so many for no reason.  China could have seen similar improvements and perhaps more without the brutality. <br /> <br />Are there some flaws in some of Chang's statistics, quotes and interviews?  Probably.  I am not in position to judge.  However I believe the great majority will withstand scrutiny. My issue with the book is that it is so relentless in pursuit of Chang's thesis (which is not ever meant to be some even-handed portrayal) that a bigger picture of context is often lost.  I walk away wondering why anybody ever followed Mao, the same question I had coming into the book.  Still the book is worth reading especially by those who so vehemently denounce it.
B0009NSDCK|5.0|AWSOME MOVIE, INSANE QUAILITY, AND KEEP IT TO YOURSELF!!! BEST MOVIE FOR ON A PLANE RIDE!!!
B000B8QEYC|5.0|There are composers; there are \\"stylists\\"; and then there are those rare people (e.g., King David, J.S. Bach, John Denver) who create their own musical genres. Add to that select list Enya, who is second only to U2 as the most popular artist that Ireland has yet produced.<br /><br />People in that select list are often criticized as sticking too closely to what they know. Such a critique misses the point. Every composer has his or her preferred musical motifs; those on this list are simply more idiosyncratic in their choices than others are. Enya is even more idiosyncratic than many. Once one understands that, one may appreciate just how creative Enya is within the musical boundaries she's (quite deliberately) set for herself.<br /><br />One measure of Enya's creative growth is how long it takes one's ear to assimilate a given album. This one has taken considerably longer than any other (and I've heard them all). It's no surprise that there's much familiar musical and verbal material here. Yet just when one's ear almost gets lulled into complacency, Enya will take a melodic turn, a harmonic turn, a change in the style of an entire song that she's never taken before.<br /><br />The name Amarantine (a variant spelling of amaranthine) itself has several meanings. Here it no doubt means \\"eternally beautiful, unfading\\", referring poetically to an imaginary flower. (The flower amaranth is quite real; one of its names is \\"love-lies-bleeding\\".) Appropriately, the album has a good number of the delicate to intense New Age love songs (including the title song) that are one of Enya's strong suits.<br /><br />The magnificent opening track, \\"Less than a pearl\\" [sic], is the first of three tracks featuring the fictional Loxian language and concepts created by Roma Ryan for her book, Water Shows the Hidden Heart. (In fact Amarantine comes close in spirit to being a concept album; one wonders what would've happened had Enya and Roma carried the idea though.) An unexpected gem is \\"Sumiregusa (Wild Violet)\\", with Japanese lyrics. (Thankfully, both the Loxian and the Japanese texts are translated into English, although I'm not sure I prefer Roma's own Loxian font over a phonetic transliteration of that language.) In total and welcome contrast, there's \\"Long, long journey\\", which (too briefly!) takes the English folk hymn style (snare drum, choir and all) to places it likely has never seen before.<br /><br />In this age of adrenaline junkies, many have lost their appreciation for the beauty and power of very simple, very slow melodies. Enya serves us some exemplars (\\"If I could be where you are\\" and \\"Drifting\\"). Not to worry -- the first is followed by some rollicking good Celtic fun (\\"The river sings\\", rather strangely so given the serious Loxian lyrics), and the second by the exquisite \\"Amid the falling snow\\".<br /><br />And as for my title? Besides the cover's color, there's the Beatle-esque character of many of the album's songs, a character even more prominent than in A Day Without Rain. A nod to the 25th anniversary of John Lennon's death? Only Enya and the Ryans know for sure.<br /><br />The one real fault of this album isn't what many critics will say it is. It's that on some songs (like \\"Long, long journey\\"), Enya hasn't thought through her ideas far enough structurally -- leaving the listener's ear unsatisfied. But I'm not about to give Enya 4 stars when I'd give her a solid 4.6 were that option available.em is \\"Sumiregusa (Wild Violet)\\", with Japanese lyrics.

6301966562|5.0|This is your classic love-triangle romantic-comedy.  Boy meets Girl.  Boy falls in love with Girl.  Boy buys Computer.  Girl falls in love with Computer?  Ok, well maybe it's not exactly the 'usual formula', but this was a movie way ahead of it's time, and yet still classic enough to make you long for the 80's again. <br /> <br />Long before Morpheus told Neo about A.I., this plucky little computer named Edgar, sprang a mind of his own, and wound up nearly overtaking a poor loser's girl away from him.  Sure it's not world domination, but then again would it be as funny if instead of the computer calling Dr. Ruth for 'relationship help', it tried to 'play a game' called Global Thermonuclear War? <br /> <br />He's the basic premise.  Guy winds up getting suckered, by a rather enterprising saleswoman, into buying a computer that can do everything.  And by everything I'm talking it can control all of your appliances, lights, doorlocks, etc.  And this was a computer from 1984.  No not Orwell's story, but released in theaters in '84, when I could only play 'Pong' on my Atari.  Anyways, the guy winds up spilling wine on his new computer, while it's connected by modem to his Boss's mainframe.  This apparently has been the secret to A.I., because before you know it, the computer has a mind of it's own and is learning exponentially. (Perhaps this is why we've always been taught to keep food and drink away from our little 'electronic friends'?)  While our would-be Hero learns about his computer's newfound abilities, a beautiful cellist, that's a classical bass for those not in the know, moves in upstairs.  As the 'Girl Upstairs' is practicing for her job with the Philharmonic Orchestra, our highly-intelligent little CPU overhears her tune and winds up mimicing, and then 'dueling' her musically.  Of course she believes it's actually 'The Guy Downstairs' playing, not a 'Learning Computer'.  Go figure, huh?  So needless to say the poor-shlub tries to use the computer's supergenius-virtuoso ability, to impress the girl.  Unforunately for him, the computer doesn't just have brains, but feelings as well, and one of them happens to be jealousy.  See the computer finds that he loves the girl and believes that she must really love him, since it is his music that impressed her to begin with.  Well needless to say this leads to comedic hillarity as the computer, who acts, not to mention talks, much like a spoiled 12-year-old who's denied something he really wants, battles it out with his 'owner'.  And I don't mean in the usual HAL 9000 or 'Joshua' from WarGames fashion.  But rather in a way that may just have inspired many a modern-day Hacker and Indentity Thief.  I won't spoil how it all turns out, but this movie with the tagline 'A Computer Fairy Tale', is much better than anything the Brother's Grimm ever came up with. <br /> <br />There's only ONE drawback.  The movie ISN'T on DVD!  This is a must have in any 80's Freak's, Romantic Tear-jerker's, Comedy Nut's, or even Computer Geek's movie library.  And how can you complete your collection if it's not even for sale?  I think it's High Time that the film's owners dusted this classic off and placed it on disc so that we can show the younger generation, we knew quite a bit about a computer's capabalities 'back in the day'.  Or maybe we might get lucky and fool 'em into thinking that our 'electronic toys' were better than their's are!
B000002U82|5.0|Pink Floyd are like Marmite - you either love 'em or hate 'em.  I happen to be part of the latter category, having been introduced to Floyd in the 6th grade when \\"Another Brick in the Wall\\" was released in the states, and later rediscovering them with \\"Young Love\\" and \\"The Dark Side of the Moon\\".   <br /> <br />Yes, they're artsy, turgid, and occasionally obtuse.  But Waters and Gilmour are musical geniuses beyond par.  This is one of my favorite albums of all time.  I could listen to it every day, and sometimes have.  For my money, there ain't a bad song on it. <br /> <br />If you hate PF, by all means post your reviews, but at least go to the trouble of trying to sound literate when you do.  Give reasons, not diatribe.
B00005RDSM|5.0|I love the scene where Peter Pan and Captain Hook are fighting with swords,it is so cool,and when he rescues Tiger Lily and Wendy,kind of a 1800's Superhero.
B0001KZM3O|5.0|This is one of the hardest albums to listen to that I've ever owned.  My copy has been in my collection for about fifteen years and in that time I've listened to it exactly twice.  I used to think it was merely depressing; a recent second listen has forced me to revise my initial assessment.  \\"the final cut\\" is probably the most soulful and poignant war requiem I've ever heard.   <br /> <br />The songs on this album were recorded, and later cut from, \\"The Wall\\", and with good reason.  Simply put, these songs deserved recognition on their own, and bundling them with \\"The Wall\\" would have diluted their effect.  This collection is simply too good to be part of any other collection. <br /> <br />Listen to it, with headphones, and think of all the soldiers returning home from wars past and present, trying to fit in, with all their emotional baggage that no one else understands.  Listen to songs like \\"the gunner's dream\\" and think about this.  And try not to break down.   <br /> <br />If you have an ounce of sentiment in you, you'll find it impossible. <br /> <br />This is not an album to be listened to again and again.  It is definitely one for the collection, though.  Maybe, like me, you'll put it on once every ten years.  Maybe less often than that.  But it's worth a listen every once in a while, just to remind us of how war affects the people who fight in them, and the families left behind afterward.

B00005JO1P|5.0|From the opening moment when Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) stares reminiscently at a saw blade, \\"Walk the Line\\" goes for the heart as it paints a vivid portrait of the Man in Black and woman, June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) who saved his life.  The films' biopic clichs (drugs and darkness to redemption, divorce to true love, unreasonable christian guilt to transcendent peace) aren't what do it, but the dynamic and deeply felt acting of Phoenix and Witherspoon.  The chemistry these two achieve, aided immeasurably by director James Mangold and music guru T-Bone Burnett, is magnetic.  Phoenix reflects Cash's demons and scarred soul, his eyes stark windows into Cash's wounded but then redeemed heart.  And Reese Witherspoon is dynamite as the sassy and strong-willed June Carter, who dealt with her own marital difficulties as she fell for the man who had her at \\"Hello, I'm Johnny Cash.\\"  The pair own the movie.  However, they owe two supporting players a load of credit.  Robert Patrick is terrific as Cashs' uncaring father, matching Phoenix blow for blow in a pivotal thanksgiving scene where long held resentments stemming the death of Cash's older brother simmer up to the surface.  And Gennifer Goodwin as Cash' first wife is stellar as well, playing the woman who bore the brunt of Cash's drug abuse and infidelity.  A biopic that resonates, \\"Walk The Line\\" sticks with genuine emotion.  Hand over the Oscars now.
B000301YY8|1.0|I have to be honest - when I first heard the single \\"You're Beautiful,\\" I thought it may be a joke. The lyrics were so painfully corny - bordering on absurd - that I thought it couldn't possibly be a serious song. Writing a song to a girl on a subway may not be terribly odd, but writing a pining love song that includes the word \\"beautiful\\" so many times the word completely loses meaning: this is ridiculous. <br /> <br />So, when I get home, I look the song up, and sure enough - the guy is for real! And what's worse, he's inviting comparisons to Damien Rice, Bob Dylan - who I'm sure would be laughing out loud if they ever heard his songs. Sadly, \\"You're Beautiful\\" isn't an odd exception, the rest of the album is pretty similar. <br /> <br />What is sad is not that someone this untalented is recording popular music, for this happens all the time. What is sad is that he is creating, essentially, teeny-bopper pop that is inexplicably being passed off as something deep.  <br /> <br />I beg of you, not only do not buy this album, make fun of it any chance you get. It is the only way to save the music world from such garbage.
0446677450|1.0|If you have no idea of any socioeconomics trends today (=the rich get richer), you should check out this book. However, if you want to save yourself some valuable time, the main idea in this book is that you should invest in long-term assets that create a constant cashflow. This way, you will have cash in the short-term while the underlying asset may appreciate so you can get a capital gain on it(i.e. a stock, or in his case, real estate). This book could've gotten the point across in 10 pages.
0553801503|4.0|What a disaster! You'd think after 5 long years to make this 4th installment as mind-blowing as the first 3, GRRM blows it by not including most of the major characters from the previous books..and worse, inexplicably, including dozens of new characters/viewpoints. Instead of showing us what's going on in the Iron Islands (North) with just one character, and what's going on in Dorne(South)with just one character, GRRM instead makes the inane decision to deluge the reader with no less than at least three POV's from each...why? It's hard enough to endure no Jon or Tyrion or Dany or Bran...but to replace them them with all these new characters that we cannot build any attachment to or for is just horrendous. And please don't get me started on the Brienne chapters! These chapters shall go down in history as the Jar Jar Binks of fantasy literature. <br /> <br />I originally wrote a 4-star review because I love(ed) GRRM so much I was hesitant to acknowledge how dissapointing this book was - say it ain't so, George! - but upon further thought and reflection, I felt I had to tell it like it was - George screwed up bad on this one.  <br /> <br />I feel like one of two things will happen now (neither one good for us readers): <br /> <br />1. GRRM will NOT acknowledge the vast amounts of bad feedback he is receiving for this book and we can reasonably expect A Dance With Dragons will be as poor as this one (because he has already written like 600 pages), or....... <br /> <br />2. GRRM WILL acknowledge these vast amounts of bad feedback and decide to scrap everything and do a complete re-write. (Which of course, means we shall all have to wait another 5 years for the next book).  <br /> <br />I cannot give 1 star, because the writing is indeed excellent, but it is just so very dissapointing to see how bad this book was fumbled. The previous 3 books, Cersei was made out to be this highly malicious and highly intelligent force to be reckoned with whilst playing the game of thrones - in this book she looks like a stumbling clod who is just flat-out stupid. I hope none of our other favorite/major characters do a complete 180 on how we expect them to handle themselves.  <br /> <br />Majorly disappointing.
B000002JS8|5.0|AC/DC-HIGHWAY TO HELL: Down Under's (and America's) answer to headbangin' salvation, AC/DC rocked harder, rolled louder, and attacked airwaves with more ferocity than anyone in the stratosphere...simultaneously injecting some much needed humor into heavy metal. Between lead yowler Bon Scott's bubble-in-the-throat screech and lecherous asides, and &#34;schoolboy in disgrace&#34; axe-ecutioner Angus Young's ball-pean-hammer-against-the-noggin notes, this fearsome fivesome made the competition sound about as dangerous as The Archies. Their Mutt Lange-produced breakthrough  boasts train-wreckin' tracks of thunderous lust such as GIRLS GOT RHYTHM and LOVE HUNGRY MAN...the stuff that made it safe to be a horny teenager in the late seventies. You also get the menacing creepy crawler NIGHT PROWLER, which oozes dirty blues and bodily fluids...and the &#34;too cool to waste as a mere album title&#34; IF YOU WANT BLOOD, belched out as a real ball-burner. Finally, there's HIGHWAY TO HELL, that undisputed king daddy of all bad-ass anthems, which hooked fans for eternity after the first three notes. Unfortunately, Scott took that titanic title track too literally, succumbing to an alcohol-related demise immediately after. They don't make swan songs like this any more.<br /><br />RATING: FIVE HORNS UP

B0000DBJDM|1.0|I wish we could return this DVD.  It is pure junk. Nothing but total confusion.
B000BVEKO0|5.0|When I first got this album, I didn't know what to think of it. It was like no other Korn album I have ever heard (and i have heard them all). In the end, i belive that this is the second best album kornhas ever had, right behind their debut. Alot of people have been saying that Korn has steped away from their heavy guitar sounds and gone into a more keyboardy sound, how ever I think the guitars have never sounded harder, and while there are some songs heavily dependent on keyboards, I still think they are great songs. <br />Here are a list of all the tracks. <br /> <br />1.Twisted Transistor-5/5 the best song on the album, with a great intro that was not realeased on the single version. <br /> <br />2.Politics-2.5/5 My second least favorite song. For some reason, I just couldn't get into this song. <br /> <br />3.Hypocrites-5/5 Another great song that i think could make a good single. <br /> <br />4.Souvenir-5/5 The heavest intro of the album I think. Another good canidate for a single. <br /> <br />5.10 or a 2-way- 5/5 another good song. I don't think it could be a single due to its graphic lyrics. Sounds like a later day \\"Trash.\\" Also, the first song to feature bagpipes, which are very much used in this album. <br /> <br />6. Throw me Away- 1.5/5 My least favorite song. It was just too slow for my tastes. <br /> <br />7.Love Song-4/5 another slow song but a little heavier that Throw me Away. Has a very trippy sound to it. <br /> <br />8.Open Up-3.5/5 Another song i just didn't like, not a real distinct sound to it that would make you want to remember. <br /> <br />9.Coming Undone-5/5 Great heavy song, that has a good easy beat that is easy to get and sing along with. <br /> <br />10.Getting Off- 5/5 Great song that could also not be a single due to its graphic lyrics. Nice sound to it though. <br /> <br />11.Liar-6/5 if thats possible. My personal favorite next to Transistor. A little faster than the rest of the other songs with great guitar parts. Also the second song to feature bagpipes.I think this should be the next single and video, personally. <br /> <br />12.For No One- 4.5/5 great guitar/drum combo in the intro, kind of a bland tone in John's voice however. <br /> <br />13.Seen It All-4.5/5 Longest song on album and one one of the heaviest parts. Also, has a old Korn feel with John's voice breaks in the center. However has a violen sound that coiunters the guitar sound. Third song to feature bagpipes. <br /> <br />14.Tearjerker-5/5 Like no other Korn song out there, really shows what John can do vocally, with this Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall's\\" music meets R.Kelly's \\"Trapped in the Closet's\\" vocals. Sounds alot like the beginning of Daddy from their debut album. Probubly the best softer song of Korn's besides \\"Alone I Break\\" from \\"Untouchables\\" <br /> <br />Extra <br />15.Eaten Up Inside-Deluxe Edition Extra Disk-5/5 the best song of the extra disk that if released with the real album, I believe the album would be so much better. <br /> <br />Overall-9.5/10 <br /> <br />Best Songs <br />Twisted Transistor <br />Liar <br />Hypocrites <br />Eaten Up Inside <br />Coming Undone <br />Tearjerker  <br /> <br />Worst Songs <br />Politics <br />Throw Me Away <br /> <br />Overall great album that should prove to be one of Korn's best.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I might have put this movie on the bottom of my \\"to be seen\\" list, if I hadn't caught the marvelous \\"Firefly\\" series in its brief run on tv.  After all, who rushes to the video store to rent a movie with the decidedly awful Adam Baldwin in it?  Certainly not me!  Luckily, Baldwin's part is small, and not enough to drag this movie down one bit.  The rest of the cast is stellar, as is the script.  \\"Serenity\\" is gritty, witty,  intelligent sci-fi at its finest.  Don't let this one pass you by!

B0000262QW|5.0|This has to rank as one of the two or three greatest fusion albums ever made, easily approaching an equal breadth of musical accomplishment as 'Bitches Brew' by Miles or 'Birds of Fire' by the Mahavishnu Orchestra. Whereas the former was an ultimate statement of stylistic exploration and the latter was the height of breathtaking ferocious musicianship, the first album by Chick Corea's Return to Forever is a masterptece of melody and free -spirited sensitivity. Underlying the shimmering tones and colors of the keyboards and soaring flights of the soprano saxophone and flute is the propulsive and virtuoso bass work of Stanley Clarke giving the perofrmances drive and conterpoint to the other instruments sometimes assuming the roll of lead improvisational instrument and enhancing the overall dynamics between the instruments; all of this moving along on a bed of joyous latin rythm. Chick Corea's electric piano, fresh from the structurally challenging work of the avant-garde free jazz of Circle, conveys an emotional sensitivity and latin sentimentality that is nothing short of wrenching and breathtaking. All of the songs build and breath and crescendo in an continually evolving apex of beautiful improvisation. Simply gorgeous musicianship throughout. Highly reccomended!
0307276902|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. It is an honest look at the life of an addict. It is very emotional and when you read it you feel like you are experiencing all the pain and anguish James is going through. You become so involved with all the characters in the book, it feels like you know them personally. When I finished this book, I was sobbing and couldn't sleep. I wanted to know more and went out the next day to buy \\"My friend Leonard\\" which is about James life after rehab.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Darren Aronofsky's \\"Requiem for a Dream\\" is probably one of the best movies I've ever seen. Reviewers below do the movie an extreme disservice by comparing it to popcorn flicks like \\"Half-Baked.\\" At risk of sounding elitist, this movie is a work of art, and you must be patient with it in order to get meaning out of it. <br /> <br />\\"Requiem for a Dream\\" has been cast, deservedly, as a drug movie. But \\"Requiem for a Dream\\" goes beyond that. It follows the stories of four people forgotten by society: an old woman condemned to a 'home' whose son has abandoned her (Ellen Burstyn in probably one of the most powerful on-screen roles I've ever seen); her son (Jared Leto) and his heroin-addict girlfriend (Jennifer Connely), and their 'associate' (a hilarious performance by Marlon Wayans). <br /> <br />All of them have their dreams - the mother's is to be young and trim again, and to see her son married and successful. Marlon's is to be with his own mother, Jared's is to forever frolick with Jennifer. The short term goal of the three of them is to score some dope, make a bunch of money in order to score more dope...it's a vicious cycle. They live out their dreams through the drugs, at least for a while.  <br /> <br />Ellen's character, meanwhile, as resorted to getting prescription pills from a doctor in order to help her loose weight - as she thinks she going to be on Tappy Tibbons' motivationalshow (the only thing she does to pass the time is watch television). She becomes addicted to them; as they are methamphetamines. And she, too, lives out her dream through the drugs - in her hallucinations, she sees Harry (Jared's character)a successful, married man and herself as the young and sexy woman she probably once was. <br /> <br />That's enough of a backstory to get a feel for the film, to go on would be to ruin the ending, which I won't do. Needless to say movie ends in complete catastrophe - this is a requiem. <br /> <br />We find that drugs exist in more than just the forms defined by society. In this movie, television is a drug, and everytime we see a doctor, they're just propping up the system, and are completely devoid of compassion. <br /> <br />This movie is a damning criticism of society for allowing, and even encouraging people to turn to the quick fix, to the drug. Television 'inspirationalists' and crooked doctors are the quiet, under-the-radar dealers of our society, and no dealer that I've met is compassionate. We have collectively sold our soals to the devil, and the devil is ourselves. <br /> <br />This story wouldn't be nearly as remarkable as it is without the film's truly astounding visuals. Liberal use of splitscreen gets us inside two different characters heads at the same time. The cuts are quick; the dream sequences are truly terrifying. Lots of other little goodies are going to make you go 'woah,' which I won't ruin for you. <br /> <br />Clint Mansell and the Kronos Quartet provide an extremely fitting score for the film - of electronica and real strings. He also worked with him on Pi. <br /> <br />This film is also a treat for Brooklynites - I thoroughly enjoyed seeing the familiar sites of the Coney Island boardwalk on screen. <br /> <br />Tappy Tibbons' inspirational CDs are $39.99 - last I checked, this DVD, chock full of special features, are only $8.97, one of the truly great bargains on this site. You owe it to yourself to own this film. <br /> <br />Be warned however: this movie is rated NC-17 for a reason. A minor, yet important portion of the movie has a gratuitous stripper/sex section. That said, use your own discretion when you show this to others, and don't deny yourself this film based soley on a couple of seconds of hardcore sex.

Well, I know what it's like to feel those jitters before you go onstage while pretending (mostly for own sake and sanity) that you're cool. I also know what it feels like to have aged enough that many might wonder if you have enough left to deliver - as you once did. Critics may be helpful in pointing out areas of their experience and expertise, but unitl you perform on a stage like Bob Dylan did with one of the best back up bands I have ever heard (...even an orchestra can be \\"back up\\"), we'd all be better off to take in and enjoy as much of this unparalleled artist, poet, musician, composer, arranger as we can while gifted with that intangible illumination rendering one completely still and...in tears.
B00000K0T8|5.0|I have to speak out against Matthew Wilson's review for the sake of all hip hop heads who may be discouraged from copping later Wu releases based on Wilson's unflattering description of albums post-Ironman. Firstly, Ghost's sophmore release, Supreme Clientele, is easily one of the most inventive and seminal hip hop albums of all time. While Ill admit it lacks the richness in production and stylistic consistency of Ironman, due to cast of rotating producers (featuring RZA, JuJu of the Beatnuts, and Inspectah, mind you), the album is a milestone due to Ghost's reinvention of his lyrical attack. In various interviews he has stated that, after the gangster style Ghost flipped on Ironman and the Purple Tape (Cuban Linx) was so blatantly bitten by MCs on the east coast (ex: Cristal, Clarks, Mafia themes, etc), he felt the need to flip a new style. The result are some of the most creative darts written, \\"Scientific, my hand kissed it, robotic, let's think optimistic, you probably missed it, watch me dolly dick it...\\" An album like 36 chambers or Ironman is blessed with consistency in quality and sound because RZA holds creative control of the project, while later Wu albums suffer from sheisty record company intereference, whack production, and whack guest MCs. However the value of growth which occurs from album to album for an MC like Ghost is impossible to ignore; these MCs elevate in skill overtime, so why would you opt to pass up hearing how they've sharpened their darts? Ultimately, you put in a Ghost abum to hear Ghost, and he's gonna be kickin you that same ill style, whether its on a RZA beat or a beat that sucks. In my opinion, any fan of Ghost will enjoy his latest Pretty Tony release, or the widely sh*t on Bulletproof Wallets, which happens to be ILL. I can agree with the idea that later Wu releases lack the atmosphere and consistency of that original Wu material, however an album like INS's Uncontrolled Substance or RZA's Digital Bullet is still more compelling and enriching that 90 percent of the other hip hop out there. By the way, cop the version of the album with Sole Controller on it.and enriching that 90 percent of the other hip hop out there. By the way, cop the version of the album with Sole Controller on it.
B000BP86OG|4.0|At first I thought this was a little weak, but after giving it a few listens, turns out  this is a really good rock album.  Not sure yet if it'll grow on me enough to say it's better than the first one, but it's definitely catchy, well produced, and more mature than I'd expected.  The sarcasm and wit are still there, although not so in-your-face, but anyone who really likes fun hard rock should check it out.  The album's artwork is brilliant as well.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|Finally, a unique rock band. Enough of that over reverbed crap even classified as rock. SOAD is a bunch of real musicians. They can actually play there instrumnets well, they have great compositions. And they have escaped classification. It is metal, true, but what? It isn't nu metal, heavy metal, prog rock, alternative. SOAD has managed to be utterly unique, I would classify them with the individuality, talents and probably the influence later on of The beatles. Every rock band between these has pretty much stayed the same. They are all classifyable, and while some were incredible, they never had that originality. Jazz had it, but not rock. I think finally SOAD has broken that streak.  <br /> <br />Oh, yeah, 5 stars to Hypnotize. Once again, a fine output by System.
B0007MWZEK|1.0|I purchased a Swivel Sweeper, manufactured by Ontel Products, through amazon.com.  The handle broke the third time it was used.  We followed the directions in the manual, which said to send the sweeper, still on warranty, to Ontel with a check for $12.99 to cover shipping of a replacement.  When no replacement was received within a reasonable time, we called them to find out what was happening.  They could not find the package we sent to them, even though their warehouse manager signed for it. We informed Customer Service of the UPS Tracking Information, with the name of the person who signed for the package at Ontel, the manager of the warehouse. Customer Service said we should stop payment on the original check and send them another check or give them a credit card number in order for them to send us a replacement.  A stop-payment would cost us $30.   <br /> <br />In other words, they would not take responsibility for their mistake.  In view of their terrible service, I would not recommend Ontel products to anyone. <br /> <br />Other comments from customers indicate they have had similar problems with Swivel Sweeper Handles cracking or breaking. Swivel Sweepers are definitely an inferior product. <br />
0060566108|3.0|For one, it is slightly difficult for me to review this book because:<br /><br />1. It shares completely all its structure & methodology with Good To Great. This is not exactly bad, but it is no different.<br /><br />2. It shares a good amount of its content with Good To Great. This is to be expected because it stands to reason that companies who made it \\"Great\\" will have commonalities with companies which have been \\"visionary\\".<br /><br />To those of you who are looking for an isolated review of \\"Built To Last\\", I apologize. This review will not cover a lot of it. I'd instead say that in my own opinion, \\"Good To Great\\" is a far better book. Now this could be because I read that one first, but I'd also like to think that this also because \\"Good To Great\\" has:<br /><br />1. About all the specific traits as far qualifying differentiators of great companies is concerned. The phraseology could be different, e.g. what is termed as \\"Clock Building\\" in BTL is called \\"Level 5 Leadership\\" in GTG.<br /><br />2. And it has more, particularly two traits that come to my mind right away. One is \\"Face the brutal facts\\" & the other being the \\"Hedgehog concept\\". The authors in many ways might have implied these traits in visionary companies in BTL, but they are not identified as points to focus on - as they are in GTG.<br /><br />On the whole, my advice is read any one of them for the marginal value of reading the other having read any one first is really little. And in case you intend to read just one, I'd recommend GTG over BTL.<br /><br />And here is one last thing I think that both books did not emphasize enough:<br /><br />So if<br /><br />Business success = Traits A(Traits common to all successful companies) + Traits B (Traits about great companies that separate them from just successful companies),<br /><br />then both books just talk about traits B. May be I should talk to JC about that, :)<br /><br />S!
B000AJJNPY|2.0|( ) is one of my favorite albums. Agaetis Byrjun is amazing too. <br /> <br />Takk, however, is not amazing. This is by far the biggest dissappointment of 2005 to me. I've listened to this album at least a dozen times now, hoping that *maybe* it would somehow grow on me -- afterall, I didn't exactly love ( ) the first time I heard it either. I even got the privelage of seeing them live -- great by the way -- which I hoped would make me like these songs better... but it didn't. There's something critical that's missing from Takk that made Agaetis Byrjun and ( ) so good: emotion. The opening of Flugufrelsarinn, the climax of Ny Batteri, the build-up in Untitled 8. These are the things that made Sigur Ros great. There are some good moments on Takk, like Glosoli, but for the most part it's just pretty noises. Takk sounds like Coldplay trying to make a Sigur Ros album. <br /> <br />If you're looking for an intro to the band, don't start here, pick up Agaetis Byrjun or ( ).
0684824906|5.0|Lincoln incorporated rivals in his political family.  Seward was buoyant, Chase restless.  Chase suffered from crippling episodes of shyness.  The childhoods of Bates and Chase were pleasant until their fathers died.  Lincoln faced unimaginable hardship.  Lincoln possessed, though, life-affirming humor.  Books were his academy, his college. In Congress Lincoln took an unpopular position on the Mexican war and lost his power.  He impressed other men with the force of his mind.  Lincoln had fierce ambition and extraordinary drive.   <br /> <br />From the date of his first speech in the Senate Seward was a leader of the anti-slavery forces.  Reactionary zeal, though, enveloped the country after the Missouri Compromise.  In 1854 anti-slavery passions were aroused with the Kansas-Nebraska Act.  Mass protest spread.  Resolutions against the law were passed.  Lincoln felt that free society was in peril.  He was not chosen as Illinois Senator at the time and was gracious in defeat and gained friends as a result.  He had the ability to transcend personal vendetta, humiliation, bitterness.  Mary Lincoln supported her husband's political ambition.   <br /> <br />At the Republican Presidential Convention Lincoln emerged as the clear alternative to Seward.  At the time of his loss, Seward projected willed equanimity.  The news that Lincoln had defeated Seward for the nomination came as a shock to much of the country.  Lincoln worked to enlist the cooperation of his rivals. When Stephen Douglas learned of Republican victories in Indiana and Pennsylvania he knew Lincoln would assume the presidency.   Douglas worked, therefore, to try to save the union.   <br /> <br />For his cabinet Lincoln selected his chief rivals.  He surrounded himself with the strongest men from every faction.  He determined to give the highest place to Seward.  Lincoln, not taking office until March, learned of significant events in the Buchanan administration indirectly from Stanton.  To Lincoln's regret hehad to steal into Washington to evade a supposed plot to kill him in Baltimore.   <br /> <br />The immediate crisis was that supplies were running out at Fort Sumter.  Then, Fort Sumter was under attack from Confederate forces.  Seward came to appreciate Lincoln's remarkable abilities as both men labored to keep Britain and France out of the war.  Lincoln dubbed McClellan leader of the army for his vitality and force.  Unfortunately he was overly cautious, or as Lincoln remarked, he had the slows.  Coming into conflict with McClellan, Scott resigned, and next, Lincoln had to relieve Fremont of his command in Missouri.  Lincoln showed logical intellect combined with an unselfish heart.   <br /> <br />Stanton was selected to replace Cameron as Secretary of War because Cameron had no method and there were supportable charges of corruption.  The death of Lincoln's son, Willie, produced in Mary Lincoln substantial change.  To overcome her sadness she nursed the wounded in Washington.  Lincoln pleaded with McClellan to act, the public treasury had been drained keeping immobile soldiers on the field.   <br /> <br />Whereas the actions of the curiously armed vessel Monitor, as it came into contact with the Merrimac, were gratifying, the losses in the Penninsula campaign were disheartening.  Nonetheless, Lincoln refused to give way to gloom.  A victory at Antietam in 1862 permitted Lincoln to issue his preliminary Emancipation Proclamation.  Victories at Vicksburg and Gettysburg turned the fortunes of the war, but unfortunately Lee escaped because General Meade did not follow up on the victory.   <br /> <br />In 1863 Seward suggested that Lincoln declare Thanksgiving a holiday.  Lincoln had the capacity to dispel anxiety in constructive ways.  In 1864 Grant assumed overall charge of the forces.  Sherman's March to the Sea produced ebullience in Washington in the winter of 1865.  A Freedman's Bureau was created.  Frederick Douglass joined the inaugural festivities.   <br /><br />Inner strength sustained Lincoln his entire life, but the strain of the presidency showed.  Richmond was captured April 3, 1865.  The surrender at Appomatox CourtHouse followed shortly afterwards.  Lincoln died April fifteenth.  His name was worshipped throughout the world.   <br /> <br />Doris Kearns Goodwin has hit upon a fruitful way to convey the Lincoln story.
0064409422|4.0|Readers have matured a great deal over the past 50 plus years. If this was a new novel, this classic novel would probably be well hidden in the shadows of Harry Potter and other recent child classics from the British Isles.<br /><br />But, the British authors of children's literature during the 20th century  can only amaze us -- even when their works are 55 years removed. Like J.R. Tolkien, A.A. Milne, Lewis Carroll, John Loftin (Dr. Doolitle), Michael Bond (Paddington the Bear) and  J.M Barrie, C.S. Lewis magically interprets the child's imagination in a manner appreciated by child, parent and grandparent.<br /><br />The narrative form of the writing lends itself to open readings between parent and child. The description of the unique creatures of Narnia are thorough, but allow the child's imagination to adorn and embellish on the same.<br /><br />This first book, of the group of 5, has been listed as one of the 100 great novels of the English language. Probably it is a bit of a stretch. But, like the writing of Lewis' contemporaries, the imagination is thorough and unique. Unlike many of his contemporaries and followers, I suggest his work to all children as the short books will not discourage young readers.  His works are the right length for the right young readers.<br /><br />Now, with the implementation of the movie, it will live a rebirth and become known by the grandchildren of those to whom the book was originally read.<br /><br />Hopefully, the books and movies continue to be watched and read for the many years to come.
0789420708|5.0|(Star rating is for this special edition.)  The Eyewitness Classics edition (ISBN 0789420708) of this popular Christmas story by Dickens has been \\"translated\\" for a younger audience, offering much historical background and outstanding illustrations while sticking closely to the original dialogue and format.  With modern illustrations by Andrew Wheatcroft, this edition also features some of the engravings from the period in explanatory sections which are interleaved with the Dickens story.<br /><br />As the chapters of Dickens's classic unfold, the child reader also learns about Dickens's London, with paragraphs about the city and its smells and the emphasis on work for all, including children.  Subsequent sections contrast the working poor with the rich, delving into the subjects of workhouses and prisons, the 7-day workweek for servants, and the lives of businessmen.  When Marley's ghost appears, the reader learns about the recording of deaths in a registry--along with the meaning of \\"grindstone,\\" the importance of Christmas charity, and the custom of servants taking the master's clothes, with the remainder going to \\"rag and bone shops.\\"<br /><br />As the three spirits appear, additional information is provided about clothing, dances and games, foods (roast goose, Christmas pudding, and chestnuts), Christmas gifts and trees, and even about the \\"crutches and frames\\" used by Tiny Tim.  Dickens's biography is mentioned briefly, with a stress on his childhood and work history, along with notes about various film versions of this and other Dickens stories, including photos of some of the stars who have played Scrooge.<br /><br />Graphically, this edition is a winner, with beautifully reproduced illustrations, a newspaper-style paste-up (with boxes, sidebars, and text and pictures set at angles to attract attention), and excellent clarity and color.  Parents, grandparents, and friends looking for an edition which will prepare children to love a stage or film version of this classic will be richly rewarded by this edition.

B00004WLXZ|5.0|Why?  Because there are several facets to this film, and it is almost impossible to comprehend everything going on all at once.  First, watch it for the original cinematography by Leni Riefenstahl.  The off-center camera angles, the close-ups, the moving camera shots.  It may not seem like anything out of the ordinary now, but compare it to other films from the early 1930s, and you will realize how ground-breaking this film really was.  Nothing like it had been seen before.<br /><br />Second, watch it for the propaganda.  This film was sanctioned and bankrolled by the Nazis, in an effort to portray themselves in the best possible light.  The Nazis had recently come to power in Germany amid much turmoil, and they wanted to get some \\"positive press\\" out to the people, and the result was this film.  It was meant to impress but also to intimidate, and it likely achieved both aims.  To see all of these Nazis chanting slogans and marching in lock-step, you get the impression that \\"Germany is on the upswing!  Come join us!\\"  That was their intention, and I dare say it was effective.<br /><br />Finally, you might want to watch it again, this time with the audio commentary by historian Dr. Anthony Santoro turned \\"on.\\"  Dr. Santoro filled his narrative with many tidbits about not only the known Nazi leaders like Hitler and Himmler, but also many of the lesser known ones, like Streicher and Bormann.  I found that his knowledge of these figures and their era added depth to my understanding of the film.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very good production.  Everyone should see this film at least once or twice.  Five stars.
B000002GB2|3.0|Equinox is in many ways one of the most unique Styx albums to date, and for good reason. First off, this album was completely self-produced album by the band, and being on a major label now, they are sounding more confident than ever before. Although not as outright experimental as \\"The Serpent is Rising\\", this album provides an effective outlet for the band to truly mingle with their sound. <br /> <br />The first thing that can be noticed about this album is that Deyoung is at the helm for every song - excluding the instrumental \\"Prelude 12\\" and the Young fronted \\"Midnight Ride\\", and most of the songs were exclusively written by DeYoung, and as a result there is a lot of synth work in this album that takes the lead more than previous efforts. There are some truly great songs on this album, \\"Lorelei\\" and \\"Suite Madam Blue\\" are superb songs that rank among the best in the Styx catalog, and \\"Light Up\\" can be considered a minor hit, but the rest of the album really becomes experimental. <br /> <br />\\"Mother Dear\\" is most likely the most obscure Styx songs - with multilayered vocals and a synth backing the song the entire time, it's truly moody and frankly, weird. \\"Lonely Child\\" is an attempt to create a ballad in the vein of \\"Lady\\", but they fall a bit short. The rockers \\"Born for Adventure\\" and \\"Midnight Ride\\" are both solid, but they tend to be forgettable when cast next to the rest of the band's work. Curulewski seems to be pretty much vacant from this album, not participating in any of the songwriting other than \\"Prelude 12\\" - and that could be considered a sign of what was to come in 1976. <br /> <br />Overall, I would not necessarily reccomend this album to the casual listener - you can get all the necessities from the album on the Styx Anthology. If you are, however, a fan of theirs or interested in their work, this album is a great reflection of the crossroads years and the breakthrough of the band.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This movie, from the series Firefly, is (like the series) the best sci-fi ever produced. The series was prematurely killed and the movie did not get the attention it deserves. I really hope that the dvd earns enough money that Joss and the studios will be encouraged to make at least two more movies and bring the series back. <br />The characters are so real, you can identify with them immediately and I'm pleased to say that they all stayed \\"in character\\" for the movie. <br />We bought the series dvds and have watched them at least a dozen times without ever tiring of the show - I know the movie will be watched over and over again at our house. <br />The only negative aspect of either the series or the movie is it ends too soon...the movie does tie up loose ends left by the premature cancelling of the series, but I still want more!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|The thing I admire the most about Madonna is her obvious smarts.  The woman is thoughtful and insightful - a self-made genius.  That being said, this CD is smart and fun dance music.  It's mutilayered: listen once and the ears might focus on the background vocals; listen again and you hear guitar; on another listen the synthesizers might stand out for you.  That is a really fun experience when listening to music.  She demonstrates the ethereality of recent times throughout the album with echoing vocals and keyboards. <br />The thing that prompted me to write this review are the critques of the lyrics from \\"I Love New York.\\"  It's my favorite song on the CD.  Completely intoxicating beats.  Come on people, it's a tribute song, a dance track, and her voice sounds great!  Enjoy the good parts! <br />I was so disappointed by AMERICAN LIFE, particularly after the genius of RAY OF LIGHT (MUSIC was fun too, but not genuis).  She wanted to make a CD that people could have fun with and dance to - she has succeeded with flying colors.
B00005JOI3|2.0|A few weeks ago I saw 'Stay' with Ewan McGregor, Ryan Gosling, and Naomi Watts. I thought the general idea was alright, about the line between the living and the dead being blurred. It could have been very interesting and indeed something I could have totally invested in, but it just didn't happen. It's strange becuase I usually love most films I see, and usually love the actors in this. The acting by everyone was good. It was just it didn't feel like it was very well executed by 'Finding Neveraland' director Marc Forster. Some shots could have been better and not so cramped. Maybe they were working on a tight budget and that's all there is to it. If that's it, and I think it could be, I will forgive this film for that. Usually I would re-watch movies if I didn't really enjoy them the first time. Unfortunately I don't think I will be doing that since the story seemed to be all over the place, and didn't have anything very clear to say. It is a shame really, but it will help me with my big DVD collection in terms of what to buy and what to leave behind at the store. This could have been better, but I think I will have to stay away from this movie in the future. I'm not worried though, because there will always be more movies on the way, from every one of these actors and director eventually.
B000BM6AVA|1.0|I bought mezmerize and was somewhat dissapointed.  The songs I liked I really liked but the majority of the album sucked.  For some reason I thought this one might be better and I was wrong.  If I didn't know better I would have thought they got a new lead singer, but of course I knew from the last album that annoying voice belongs to some other band member.  Doing some back up vocals would be allrigt or maybe having one song in the spot light would be fine as well, but when I purchase music from a band I'm used to rocking out to and there is another voice ALL OVER the album I feel like I was tricked into buying someone elses CD.  If you like system of a down this is not the album for you.  This is SOAD's side project with Serj on backup vocals.  The few songs he does sing in suck anyway.  If I was SOAD I would quit before putting out any more crap like this with my name on it.  If the other guy wants to sing that bad let him start his own band.
B0007TFI92|5.0|The first record by Tangerine Dream that i heard, and i believe it to be one of their best.  departing from the heavy dissonance of Ziet, Atem is a more subtle journey through strange sonics.  most of this album is fairly difficult to describe, and i wouldn't say it has a very deffinite emotional context, being rather abstract.  most of the sounds are created with high pitched moving synths and melotrons, though there are some lower sounds and a few very good drum portions.  while at first i did not really get it, this album's strange feel became very infectious.  i can recall listening to Fauni-Gena, and someone coming into my room and saying, 'what are you listening to, an aviary?'  anyway, while i find it rather difficult to review this album, i must say that some of the complaints for this work are that it is less harsh than Ziet, but i really don't think it would have been great if they had simply done that album a second time.  this is much more subtle, but itself rather strange and dissonant.
B0009S3HI0|4.0|finally a deftones music video dvd.  i just bought it for the music videos.  i have only seen one deftones music video on mtv back in 1998 i think and that was by accident.  i guess mtv had nothing to do but play \\"my own summer\\" in between TRL and reruns of Real World.  I love the deftones and i have followed them for years, ever since i discovered adrenaline in 1998 and around the fur.  i knew there was something more to them than korn and limp bizket and the deftones have stood the test of time and passed the 10th anniversary mark.  too bad their equipment truck was stolen and they lost so much material.   <br /> <br />anyways i love how the dvd has commentary in between the videos.  the package looks fresh and the videos are abundant.  i would have loved to seen a live show of MX on there, especially when they were going on tour back in the summer of 2000.  the cd was alright.  nothing new that i haven't heard.  i am a little tired of the \\"be quite and drive\\" acoustic version.  it is too slow and it puts me to sleep.  they should have replaced it with \\"can't even breath\\".  the standout song for me were: <br /> <br />simple man <br />
0563524928|2.0|I love Bill Bryson.  I love to listen to his narration of his books during my long commute to work.  I didn't even notice that someone else was reading this audiobook until I started to listen.  No bother, it'll still be great, right? Wrong.  Kerry Shale narrates this at high speed, making you wish \\"slow down\\" was an option on the cd player.  He's overly sarcastic, making Bill's subtle jabs sound down-right mean.  It's only 2 discs long, but I can't help but wonder if it would have been 3 or 4 if Bill had read it in that wonderful way he has.  I had to stop listening after about 5 minutes.

B000A2XC1C|1.0|Awful.  Just plain awful.  This is an outline for an interesting movie but they just put the whole thing out there in 1985 without editing the really crap parts of it and alas it suffered because of it at the box office.  I remember when it came out and saw all of the bad reviews for it but considering I was so young at the time (does 12 count as young?), I thought nothing of it but none the less  I didn't see the flick at the time.  Now I have and can honestly say that this is just one bad film.  There's no life in this movie.  No characterization or depth to anyone in it.  The movie is called \\"Santa Claus: the Movie\\"  but when Santa is the least interesting person in the whole thing, there's a problem.  He's not even really the main focus of the film and that's one of the biggest problems there is with this thing.  Is it Santa's movie or Dudley Moore's?  Really it's neither.  The film meanders from one person to the other and then to those that really shouldn't have any attention paid to them at all (the rich girl and the poor boy).  Avoid this film at all costs.  If you must see this movie, rent it and only do so with caution.  There's a decent featurette and audio commentary so you can at least see that there was some \\"love\\" that went into producing this DVD but that's only because it's Anchor Bay Entertainment and they're pretty good for bringing out the best  in even really horrible films like \\"Santa Claus: The Movie\\".
B000BKJ78U|1.0|Ranking myself in Star Wars fandom on a scale of 1 to 5 stars, I'm definitely 5 stars; however this dvd release on a scale of 1 to 5 stars, definitely does NOT receive 5.  Last year's release of the equally disappointing 4 disc set and the price are completely irrelevent, Recardo from San jose.  What most of the reviewers have tried to express but may not have done so effectively, is that any legal version of the first Star Wars trilogy on DVD that is for sale or ever has been for sale by retailers only contains the Special Editions of the films that were released in 1997 and the additional inserts put in for the first release on DVD in 2004.  These DVD releases do not contain the films exactly as they were presented in theaters in 1977, 1980, and 1983.  They are not the films we grew up with.  <br />  <br />I'm with Kevin from Philly, that George Lucas has his right to alter his works since he is the artist.  However, he would not have any success without the continued support of the fans for decades, who would appreciate the option of viewing the Star Wars films in widescreen on DVD in their original theatrical versions and not being restricted to have only these new \\"Director's Cut\\", so to speak, special edition versions.  The packaging doesn't even warn you that the DVDs only contain the special editions.  The cover art of the box is fantastic, and the movies are fine if you prefer digital paint on every frame of the original movies.  The box is misleading in that it claims that you are getting all three classic films digitally remastered.  Using the word classic was wrong since the box contains the post 1997 versions and not the actual classic versions.  I for one don't like seeing the semblance of a Venus Fly Trap superimposed onto the Sarlac in the Tatooine Desert in \\"Return of the Jedi\\" or the horribly choreographed new Ewok music at the end of the film.  The cantina scenes in Jabba's Palace wreak also.  \\"A New Hope\\" and \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" were altered a bit also, but \\"Return of the Jedi\\" was butchered the most.   <br /> <br />Here's some Advice for all of you who are purists and believe that Lucas got it right the first time, don't get your hopes up that he will release a non-special edition of the first three films.  He is ashamed of them and doesn't want people to be able to see them the way they were anymore.  He thinks his revisions are the only acceptable versions.  Just like Lucas said about the corny Star Wars Christmas special that aired on TV in 1979?, that he wishes he could have every copy of it rounded up and destroyed, he would probably like to do the same with all the old pre-1997 VHS versions of the movies and the Laserdisc versions.  For right now, what might be your last chance to own a legal high quality widescreen DVD  copy of the original theatrical versions of the films is to buy a copy of the Laserdisc definitive edition and some DVD digital transfers of the Laserdisc off *bay or transfer it yourself if you have the equipment.  This is legal under U.S. copyright law to have a backup copy of a work if you own the original, hence a having a DVD backup of the Laserdisc set that you own would be legal.  I hope this helps some of the fans out there.   <br /> <br />Again, mine nor most other's gripes on here are about the price or the lack of a bonus disc.  As stated previously, the problem is the lack of availability of an original theatrical, non-special edition version, with or without a bonus disc.  Just as retailers can sell two separate boxed sets, one with a gold bar on the box that says full screen and one with a silver bar that says wide screen, why can't they be given one to sell that says Theatrical Version full or wide screen and one that says Special Edition/Revised Version full or wide screen??  I already own VHS, Laserdisc, Laserdisc backup, and 2004 DVD release of the movies but if the theatrical versions were to become available on DVD in stores I would buy one in a heartbeat.Lucas would make a lot of money off it, but he won't because the newer versions represent his creative vision which has obviously changed dramatically since 1977.  Someone should start a nationwide, even a worldwide petition to Lucas to offer the films in their original, unaltered theatrical versions.        <br /> <br />
B000002UTI|4.0|Since this collection came out when I was in high school, it served as my introduction to John Lennon. I knew alot of Beatles before, and I've collected alot of his solo work since, but this gave me my first listens to \\"The Balled Of John And Yoko\\", \\"Jealous Guy\\", and my favorite track \\"Julia\\". The great things about this soundtrack is that it's 21 tracks long, and 20 of them are wonderful. It also gives you some of his Beatles AND solo material. However, that's also where it lacks. In trying to cover both eras, it misses a huge amount of each. It reminds me of that \\"Best Of Sting And The Police\\" collection. I do love this album, and it is nice for just one discs worth, but I would first recommend \\"Lennon Legend\\" for his solo years, and of course \\"Beatles 1\\" if you want just the tip of that iceberg.
B000BVEKO0|5.0|The new album is awesome. Its very diffrent from all other KoRn albums, but thats what makes it great. With every KoRn album you wont hear the same song over and over. The drum beats and bass are amazing on this album and everything is just pieced together perfectly. Even at the loss of the guitarist (Head) KoRn can still make a killer album and strike back at those who said they were finished
0679731725|4.0|When I began reading this book, I thought it would be a stuffy novel about an old butler.  It is, but it is about so much more.  The story slowly unfolds on each page in a way that the story is told without ever being told.  A great reading experience.
B00008PC2O|3.0|I just bought this because of the glowing reviews.  Unfortunately, the ONLY reason I got it is for the HD content.  And the player locks up on my media PC.  I researched the error and it is known and there is no fix for it yet. <br /> <br />If you would be happy without the HD this is great.  If you are counting on the HD buy at risk.  There are still way to many variables for the video to consistenly work.  This is mainly because of copy protection and all the funky stuff they try to do to ensure you only use their player etc. <br /> <br />Also, another reviewer referred to a code you need to view the HD content.  I never saw a place to enter it.  My installation went to the internet and got the codec necessary to run it and never asked me for any number to validate anything. <br /> <br />This may work in the end but the process is starting out on the wrong foot.
0140177396|3.0|I thought Of Mice and Men was a good book. It is a tale of two drifting ranch hands, George and Lennie, trying to make money to own land of their own someday.  George is quite small and very smart, while Lennie on the other hand is big in size, and is dumb. He thinks like a child. They become laborers in California's dusty and dirty vegetable fields.  While they are there, they always got themselves into trouble.  Usually the trouble had to do with Lennie. Towards the end, Lennie got himself in to much trouble and everyone wanted him gone.  I would have to say I loved the ending of the book, because you would never guess that that would have happened.
B000002L9J|4.0|I hesitate to call this their best album like many do, but that doesn't keep it from being one of their best, or even one of the 80's best. This album, and this band has touched many people, and a written review does little justice to it. This truly is a near-flawless album. \\"The Boy With The Thorn In His Side\\" is classic, \\"Cemetary Gates\\" is tons of fun, and I'm sure \\"There Is A Light That Never Goes Out\\" has been the song of thousands of couples. It might be my #1 Smiths song. Also well worth a mention is the moving \\"I Know It's Over\\", and the closer \\"Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others\\". I might first suggest \\"Louder Than Bombs\\" or \\"Singles\\" to a newcomer, but \\"The Queen Is Dead\\" is still essential Smiths.
B0006399FS|1.0|Buy the anthology album that dates up to 1990 because everything these geezers have put out since then sucks.  I guess they still sell alot of albums because some people agree with Bonos political views, which is sad because his views are contrived.<br /><br /> He gets alot of credit for being a humanitarian.... he lives in Malibu!  Bill Gates gives a much bigger percentage of his earnings to charity than Bono does but gets 1/2 as much credit.<br /><br />Keep buying his albums you naive libs.
6304983778|5.0|I first saw this film when I was 5 years old at the cinema and have been hooked on it since.  I have had 3 copies on VHS and last year found out it had been released on DVD - Santa very kindly delivered a copy in my stocking on Christmas morning the very same year!   <br /> <br />On visiting a friend recently, I was introduced to her two year old nephew for the first time - he's a little monster but adorable with it.   <br /> <br />We were talking about Santa and his Reindeers and how many presents they were going to bring him this year and the thoughs crossed my mind that I still had a VHS copy in the attic. <br /> <br />My intention was to pass it on to him but I am a bit of a softy and couldnt bring myself to part with it so I bought yet another copy to give to him as an early chrsitmas gift. <br /> <br />On giving the DVD to his parents, we promptly all sat down to watch the film together (all 8 or us) and not one person can say a bad thing about the film.  Even for its age, the special effects make it magical, the story keeps you interested and the sets and costumes are brilliant. <br /> <br />Anyone with children (or an ounce of christmas spirit in their bones) must get this film and I can guarentee, you will be hooked too!
B00005JO1P|5.0|I walked into this movie and within a few minutes I wsa drawn in and completly engrossed in what proved to be one of the best films I have seen this year.  For a year as depressing as this one with maybe three or four movies really reaching me (Cinderella Man is by far the best movie to come out this year followed by this film, Crash, Batman Begins, Saw II and the ever under-appreciated Domino) I was so happy to walk out of a film feeling glad that I went.  Joaquin puts on a performance of a career and is a lock for the Best Actor nomination (with all the talk Hoffmans getting for Capote I doubt Phoenix will win, but he WILL be nominated) and Witherspoon is PERFECT as June Carter, almost even more perfect in her role than Joaquin was that her nomination may result in a win.  I never knew that much about the life of Johnny Cash, and I never really listened to his music, I mean I knew the song Ring of Fire...but after watching this movie I have a newfound respect for the man.  I've heard that the daughter or Cash and his first wife threw a fit about the way her mother was portrayed and that it was false...but you know that with EVERY biopic there are libertys taken, but these libertys do not take away from the feel of the film.  By the end you will be in tears and you will come to appreciate the man that is now the legend...
B0007MAO0M|4.0|When \\"Silverado\\" came out 20 years ago, I recall quite a bit being made of the \\"revival of the Western\\" that it, and \\"Pale Rider,\\" released at about the same time, supposedly entailed.  Needless to say, that revival came neither in 1985, nor with the somewhat larger outpouring of Westerns in the early 1990's (\\"Unforgiven,\\" \\"Dances with Wolves,\\" etc.).  In large part, the failure of the \\"western revival\\" is because none of these films, with the partial exception of \\"Unforgiven,\\" found anything really new to say in the genre. <br /> <br />That isn't to say that \\"Silverado\\" is a bad film, or one not worth watching; to the contrary, I probably enjoy it as much as I enjoy any post-\\"Wild Bunch\\" Western.  To enjoy it, you have to accept it for what it is, and that's a B-Western.  A very large, color B-Western with some big names in the cast, and some very well-done action scenes, but still a B-Western.  That means, first of all, that the plot is pretty basic: four men--all very proficient gunmen, of course--are thrown together early in the film by circumstances, and become friends.  They then team up to free the town of Silverado from the domination of a ruthless cattleman and the crooked sheriff who takes his orders.  There are nods here and there in the direction of more subtlety and complexity, but they are only nods.  The one storyline which offered something rather unorthodox, involving Rosanna Arquette's widowed homesteader, was cut almost entirely from the final version of the film. <br /> <br />It's safe to say that in 1985, when \\"Silverado\\" came out, there weren't a lot of actors under about 50 who had much experience in Westerns; however, director Lawrence Kasdan succeeded in assembling a team of four strong leads.  Scott Glenn took to the saddle like a natural--had he been born a generation earlier, he could, at the least, become a major Western star on the level of a Joel McCrea.  He is superb as the tough gunfighter Emmett.  As Jake, Emmett's younger brother,Kevin Costner gave a vigorous, zesty performance that will surprise anyone used to some of his more recent work.  Danny Glover brought to the role of Mal much of the strength and solidity that he later showed in the \\"Lethal Weapon\\" series.  Kevin Kline, as Paden, is the least successful of the leads--he isn't really a convincing six-gun artist--but he does provide some nice light moments in the intervals between the action. <br /> <br />Brian Dennehy, as the aforementioned crooked sheriff, Cobb, is solid in the main villainous role, and Jeff Fahey is effective as his nastiest deputy, Tyree (one detects a faint homage to John Ford in the character's name).  Ray Baker, as the cattleman McKendrick, has relatively little screen time.  Many of the other supporting players seem oddly cast--John Cleese as the sheriff of a neighboring town, Jeff Goldblum as a gambler, Linda Hunt as a saloonkeeper--but they all work out more or less adequately.  Rosanna Arquette's part, as noted, largely disappeared during editing, no doubt leaving viewers puzzled that she is billed third. <br /> <br />Action scenes in a Western mean some mixture of gunfights and galloping horses, and \\"Silverado\\" has both in abundance.  While none of these scenes are exceptionally original, they are generally well-executed.  There is enough action that, even at a length of well over 2 hours, the pace never really lags long enough for viewers to notice.  Bruce Broughton's score provides nice accompaniment for all the goings-on. <br /> <br />The 2-disc DVD set contains some nice extras,  chief among them being two featurettes, a \\"making-of\\" which centers on comments from Lawrence Kasdan (quite good), and a retrospective featuring Kevin Costner (OK, a bit chatty).  Be warned, however, of a bit of slightly dishonest labelling regarding another extra--the \\"History of Western Shootouts, narrated by John Cleese\\" should really have been called \\"a promotional video for some mediocre Columbia Westerns, narrated by John Cleese.\\" <br /> <br />If you like Westerns, and can accept \\"Silverado\\" for what it is, this DVD is a very good buy.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I think it is her best work in a while.  It is so fresh and hip.  I am impressed.
0307276902|5.0|I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ ! JAMES FREY IS VERY TRUTHFUL AND SEEMS TO TELL ALL. I THINK IT IS GREAT THAT HE USED WHATEVER WORKED FOR HIM TO TREAT HIS DRUG AND ALCOHOL ADDICTION EVEN IF IT WASN'T \\"THE TWELVE STEPS\\". WHAT WORKS FOR SOME DOES NOT ALWAYS WORK FOR EVERYBODY ALL OF THE TIME. <br />HE WAS ABLE TO BATTLE HIS DEMONS AND LEARN NEW COPING SKILLS AND I THINK THAT IS WHAT IT TAKES TO LIVE A HAPPY LIFE! <br />HE IS A GREAT AUTHOR AND I CAN'T WAIT TO READ HIS NEXT BOOK!  <br />
B0000001PW|4.0|Corea and his band hit on some good song structures here as well as turn in some tasty solos to make for a better than average listening experience for fusion fans while avoiding the bland sounds of \\"smooth jazz\\".<br /><br />HIGHLIGHTS:<br /><br />Best track here for my money is \\"Got a Match?\\" as Chick Corea's multilayered keyboards soar over a solid walking bass line from John Patitucci. On \\"Sidewalk\\" it's probably Corea's Fairlight synth that gives the insistent bass pulse. \\"City Gate\\" isn't so much a separate song as it's the quiet prelude to \\"Rumble\\". It's aptly named...suggesting a street brawl rather than a Jets and Sharks Broadway-style dance fight. \\"Elektric City\\" resembles a theme song for a long-lost 80s cop show pilot. \\"King Cockroach\\" starts with interesting shifting percussion from Dave Weckl and also features frenetic Corea soloing. Weckl also is key to closer \\"Silver Temple\\" as his nimble cymbal work sets the pace before the track segues into more of a Scott Henderson guitar workout later on.<br /><br />LOWS:<br /><br />There's no \\"boogie\\" to be found on \\"Cool Weasel Boogie\\". It's one of the few here that I find boring.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />If you want to hear the fusion side of Corea's work in the 80s, this is a good choice. Recommended.
0064409422|3.0|3 stars is being generous; should be 2.5, really, overall, but out of sentimental value I bumped them up half a star. As a child, I absolutely loved the Narnia series and devoured all the books over and over again.     I recently went back and re-read them again, and to my deep disappointment, I could not feel that they held up; they did not age well. I found them preachy, condescending (remember Lewis describing all the evil creatures that attended Aslan's execution? \\"if I described them, your mother would not let you read this book\\"? oh, come ON), sexist (\\"battle is ugly when women fight\\" -- what, it's not ugly period?) and racist (recall the brown evil Calormenes and the fair good Narnians). As a longtime fan of Tolkien, I have to acknowledge that his work, too, is racist and sexist, but in his work it doesn't strike anywhere as strongly as in Lewis' work; it is not nearly as blatant. Also Narnia just feels shallow somehow. I read one reviewer describe Lewis as a magpie -- picking the shiniest mythological jewels with which to adorn his Narnia-nest, regardless of whether or not they match, and I have to agree. In addition, he has mere children going into bloody medieval battle -- recall Peter's one-on-one combat with King Miraz in Prince Caspian? -- without ever considering, realistically, the effects on a child of committing that kind of messy, sweaty, smelly, bloody slaughter. I know it's children's literature, but I don't feel it does children any favors to pretend ugliness isn't there when it is. You needn't spell it out in explicit detail, but at least don't pretend it ISN'T horrifying. That is not only dishonest, but dangerous.    Still, there are some very affecting passages. The scene at the end of \\"Prince Caspian\\" when Susan and Lucy go on their romp with Aslan is one of the best I've ever read, and who can help loving Mr. Tumnus or feeling a chill at the White Witch? Or weeping along with Lucy and Susan when Aslan is murdered, and then smiling in delight when he rises up again whole, joyous and strong? And then the best scene, in my opinion, of the whole series is when they arrive in Paradise in \\"The Last Battle\\" to find, to their shock, a Calormene devotee of the demon Tash there ahead of them. To him, Aslan says in effect, \\"Nothing good can be done to him, nor anything evil done to me, so when you did good in Tash's name, you were actually doing that good in service of me.\\" A startling and uplifting opinion for such a conservative Christian author to express, even in fiction! (And one I wish the fundamentalist Christian rightwing in the USA would pay more attention to.)    But I would recommend, if you want to read Lewis at his astounding best -- and it is astounding -- picking up a copy of \\"Till We Have Faces.\\" One of the best pieces of literature I have ever read, he deserves to be known for that rather than for his amusing but rather tepid Narnia series.
B000BVD460|1.0|Seriously!!!!!.....is eminem going insane???....or are the suits and ties in his record company brain washing him to release easy sell commercial rubbish??. Come on this aint a greatest hits!!!!....if this was a greatest hits then any song from his album ''Encore'' wouldn't even get a look in!. That album was very poor and Em's continuing his fall from the top of the rap tree with this dissapointing Greatest Hits release. I cant beleive they have ''Just lose it'' and ''mockingbird'' on this album. All cedibility has been lost and all is left is commercial pop-rap for 12 y/o kids. Why do we need to hear another song like ''when im gone'', we get the point em.....you love your daughter!. The only glimpse of light in this album is eminem's two classic joints ''The Way i am'' and the ground breaking ''Stan''. But where are his other classic joints which made him the lyrical genius we all grew to love. Where's Kill you, Role Model, criminal, Just dont give a f*ck, Bonnie and Clyde, Marshall Mathers,White America...the list goes on and on......Sorry em, i was a huge huge fan of your work but your turning into the commercial money grabbing artists you used to diss when your songs were good.
B00062ZE3U|5.0|An unbelievable album. It is awesome from beginning to end. There is not one weak song. Great vocals, musicianship, and orchestration. A masterpiece of progressive metal.
0440241588|1.0|What happened to Grisham? Why can't he just write novels like \\"Pelican Brief\\" or \\"The Firm\\"? Why does he have to tell us about painting houses, southern African American ladies' home cooking... and now about his last trip to Italy, poorly disguised as a \\"thriller\\"? <br /> <br />I have relocated to Italy in 2000, and I still live there; what I hate is romantic descriptions about the good coffee and the oh so romanic restaurants and old towns. Italy is NOT romantic for those who live there. So, if you want to read about the \\"real\\" Italy, read e.g. \\"The Dark Heart of Italy: Travels Through Time and Space Across Italy\\" from Tobias Jones (available through Amazon ;-) and do not get yourself lulled by Grisham's superficial observations. <br /> <br />And how poorly he has researched the details! Terminal 2 in Malpensa airport is strictly charter, so no non-stop scheduled flights to Dulles from there, I am afraid. And by the way, there is not and was never a Lufthansa direct flight to Dulles from MXP. Why did Grisham not simply pick up a flight schedule?  <br /> <br />Train trip from Milano Centrale to Zrich: The first stop in Switzerland is always Chiasso, and not Belinzona. AND: There are very strict passport controls on all trains between Italy and Switzerland. Why did Grisham forget to mention that, especially since \\"Mario\\" was so worried about his false passport? I guess Mr. Grisham simply \\"forgot\\" that Switzerland is not part of the EU, but why taking care of these details? As a 'murican he needs not know that, does he? <br /> <br />In other words: As a description of Italy the book is superficial, even dangerously romantisizing, and as a thriller it is terribly slow-paced and at times outright boring. <br /> <br />
0671027344|5.0|As a 30-something woman, I didn't know how I'd relate to a 16-year-old male character, but I nonetheless decided to read 'Perks' at the strong recommendation of several friends.    I am so glad I did.  I can't imagine anyone not relating to the character of Charlie on at least some significant level.  And, even the experiences that are unique to his life alone are told in such a compelling, intriguing, entertianing manner.      This is an incredibly quick yet unforgettable read, so do yourself a favour and go for it.    Also- if you love this book as much as I do, I encourage you to read anything by David Sedaris. Even though he draws on his own personal experiences, he makes them //hysterically// relatable.     (...)  I discovered her through word of mouth. She writes in the same vein as Sedaris and Chbosky- and best of all, her writing is FREE! I check her site about 5 times daily to see if she's updated and to catch up on her older entries.  She's been writing for almost a year and completely gets me through my work day!!!!
0140177396|5.0|Of Mice and Men follows two men in their pursuits through the Great Depression. One of the men, George, is the average quick-witted man.  His traveling partner, Lennie, is beyond kind and only has the best intentions in mind, but is mentally challenged and has an ogre-esque build.  He represents the innocence of man, but even though his intentions are for the best they often create trouble.  Lennie and George are in search of work, so they become ranch hands at a farm.  They desire the same dream as most Americans at this time, the American Dream.  They wish to own a small farm, work for themselves, raise animals, and \\"live off the fatta the land\\".  This novel follows two men in through evil, innocence, death, corruption, loneliness, companionship, strength and weakness. <br /> <br />America was founded on opportunity.  Early Americans emigrated from different countries for work, religion, freedom from war, and several other reasons.  The poverty stricken was in search of land and wealth.  George and Lennie only wanted to own a piece of land and \\"tend the rabbits\\".  All that mattered to them was being self sufficient and have the joys of life.  They were in search of opportunity, just as Americans are still in search of today.   <br />
0553801503|5.0|As many readers have noticed before, the \\"A Song Of Ice and Fire\\" books are the best fantasy books written in the last fifteen years. This 4th book is not as a masterpiece a s the previous three, but is still much better than any books from Jordan, Eddings, Brooks & similar writers. This book lacks my favourite characters: Jon, Daenerys and Tyrion; this is his great fault, but the story is interesting and well-written. The principal POV have complex personalities and struggle to keep theirselves alive in a hideous world full of treachery. The best storylines are about Jaime, the GreyJoys and the Dornishmen. I also enjoyed Samwell's chapters as well...only Brienne is a little boring, but the end is really astonishing. In the end, I think that the book is worth the reading, and Martin's style is over-the-top in the adult fantasy genre!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|1. Hung Up - My favorite track on the album. Super catchy. Has a fabulous ABBA sample of Gimme, Gimme, Gimme (A Man After Midnight). <br /> <br />Rating: 10/10 <br /> <br />2. Get Together - A nice, slighty boring track. One part of the  <br />song kind of remindeds me of her previous hit \\"Holiday.\\" <br />Rating: 6/10 <br /> <br />3.Sorry - Another breakup song. The track begins with Madonna saying the word \\"Sorry\\" in many different laguages. It's the next single. \\"Sorry\\" chorus samples the bass line from The Jacksons' song \\"Can You Feel\\". <br /> <br />Rating: 7/10 <br /> <br />4. Future Lovers - Starts with Madonna once again speaking. Contains which seems to becoming a popular lyrics from the album, \\"In the evidence of it's brilliance.\\"  <br /> <br /> <br />Rating: 6/10 <br /> <br />5. I Love New York - This song has an awesome beat. Lyrics kind of suck though. But I think she kind of wanted it to sound stupid. Like the rap part in American Life. <br /> <br /> <br />Rating: 8/10  <br /> <br />6. Let It Will Be - This song also features an awesome beat. The lyrics are about her fame as a internation superstar. <br /> <br />Rating: 8/10 <br /> <br />7. Forbidden Love - This song doesn't really fit on this album but one of my favorites nevertheless. Features a nice blend of vocoder and untainted vocals. <br /> <br />Rating: 9/10 <br /> <br />8. Jump - a nice track and keeps the pace of the album slighty slower. <br /> <br />Rating: 7/10 <br /> <br />9. How High - Another one of the favoites.  My favorite lyric in is in this song, \\"It's funny how everybody mentions my name, they're never very nice.\\"  <br /> <br />Rating: 9/10 <br /> <br />10. Isaac - I think this is a pretty good track. The humming in it reminds me of \\"Frozen\\" of her album, Ray of Light. The chant isn't too bad <br /> <br />Rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> <br />11. Push - A very motovational song Madonna wrote about her husband. It has a great beat. <br /> <br />Rating: 9/10 <br /> <br />12. Like It Or Not- This song doesn't really fit on this album. A textbook close to the album. <br /> <br />Rating: 6/10 <br /> <br />Overall Rating: 9/10
B00006BSGZ|5.0|This is a conflation of two rare televised appearances of Callas from Covent Garden. The first was filmed in 1962 and Callas is in surprisingly good voice, considering she had almost given up at this time (her only other appearances that year were a series of concerts - no stage appearances at all). The Verdi is sung with a wealth of detail and expression and she acts out all Elisabetta'a emotions vividly, while hardly moving a muscle. Indeed she is so immersed in her singing that when a large brooch she is wearing dislodges and drops to the floor, she barely notices. She then changes completely into a playful, sexy and dangerous Carmen. What a pity she never wanted to sing the role on stage.<br /><br />The second part of the DVD is a fully staged performance of Act2 of Tosca with Tito Gobbi and Renato Cioni. Why oh why didn't they have the forseight to film the whole thing? Still I guess we should be grateful for what we have. There are faults - the camera work isn't all it should be - but this is surely the most riveting perofrmance of this act ever committed to film.True, Callas was in better voice when she filmed this same Act in Paris a few years previously (some of the top notes are little better than screams), but I have rarely, if ever, seen opera singers act with such naturalness and abandon. Both Callas and Gobbi are superb. You really forget they are singing and end up being totally drawn in to the performance of two actors. In fact I remember that on the days I worked at the English National Opera shop, whenever we played this video when the audience were gathering for that evening's performance, the tiny little shop would quickly fill up with people who couldn't take their eyes off the television screens. Enough said!
B0000029LG|4.0|This was my first ever set of Mijac's music and I immediately liked it. <br />   I only would like to discuss the second CD because it contains new music. <br />   SCREAM is the greatest song and video I ever experienced from Mijac. This is an effective, dynamic duet with sister Janet. I hope that's one of the songs MJ's remembered for. This is the sterile-white energy of two talents.  <br />   THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT US: I see it simply a masterpiece. A futuristic and earthly drum-driven trance-spitting beat from which a hip-hop-styled anti-racist hymn grows.  <br />   STRANGER IN MOSCOW: R&b jam about space-huge loneliness among billions of people. Rainy dayz of Sting's 'Englishman in New York'.  <br />   THIS TIME AROUND: streetwise steel-funk with Mijac  <br />screaming on it.  <br />   EARTH SONG: maybe one of the last decade's or popular music's widest known harmony. You know what catharsis is? When at a point you feel that the music gets into your blood and you wanna explode and cry and not think of anything.  <br />   MONEY: Mijac near-raps a choked flow of strange, phobia-filled jam.  <br />   D.S.: interesting bot boring funk. If not too angry then too repetitive.  <br />   COME TOGETHER: a great and unique rock-funk-urban-dance version of the Beatles song. Groovy. Trademark.  <br />   YOU ARE NOT ALONE: a silky r&b jam. If you don't like it, consider that there are songs that don't even have any melody.  <br />   CHILDHOOD: a too syrupy song but tells the maximum. Freud conjured.  <br />   TABLOID JUNKIE: I think it's a great enjoyable popular new jack song. An addictive chorus. The way he imitates dirty-perv-mouthed gossip-eaters by beatboxing is gorgeous!  <br />   HISTORY: I remember having a unit in my English book with this title. And it was about : is it HIS or even HER story?  <br />   A big crossover epic-hymn with all the effects and all the styles about all the things of the world. The very definition of MJ's music. Drums, smooth chorus, pumping beat, row vocals and - a beginning and an end. Big treasure today.  <br />   2BAD: he shouts it over. Hip-hop. Loud and dark. But more like glowing coal.  <br />   LITTLE SUSIE: evokes a vocally perfect mini-opera. This again has a story that makes you more.  <br />   SMILE: one of MJ's biggest vocal. BTW, Chaplin's composition. Very balanced and rich. Worth listening to at closing your days.

B000002BVN|4.0|Blood on the dance floor is mainly a remix album of Michael Jackson's HIStory songs.  <br />     Well, the thing is that I don't like remixes but there is one that's definitely good. That's the remix of track 'HIStory'.  <br />     Now on to the new stuff. MJ really did well by choosing 5 new tracks because it convinced me that his every song is different and innovative.  <br />     BOTDF, as fans often call it, has the  <br />title track on it: this is an echo-filled, strong, blood-red composition of dance with a bit of techno, soul and rock. This is unique if you believe me.  <br />I enjoyed it through a whole summer when I watched  <br />the video for it every day!  <br />MJ proves that he is a good and.. an even better dancer. A real surprise. Even a friend of mine who is far from being an MJ-fan, told me that he finds MJ a better dancer than he'd done before.  <br /> <br />    SUPERFLY SISTER is a rap-like but still strangely soulful track with a catchy beat and a great 'east coast' feeling I like very much. It's got a message, listen up!  <br /> <br />    GHOSTS is a great r&b song that is solid, consistent and you can easily get hooked on the melody. The video is awesome, too. I bet!  <br /> <br />    IS IT SCARY: brother of the previous one. Jackson's best vocal achievement since 1995's 'Smile' and before 2001's 'Unbreakable'. An r&b-based song that grows to a pop hymn - without a hymnical feature.  <br /> <br />    MORPHINE: This is I think MJ's most unique song ever, quite the 'Musicology' for him. This is fully composed & ordered by him, he even plays the instruments.  <br />The song mixes an acid and steely beat with innovative vocal elements of metal and even a Jackson-style rap. So a closed composition emerges.  <br />I hated Morphine first. But now I see it as a kind of masterpiece.  <br /> <br />    OK. Don't buy it. It's mess.  <br />But I bet you still do. Enjoy!
B000BW7QX6|5.0|It was a long long time coming to Germany, but I was finally able to see Serenity.  It was worth the wait.  I love sharp witty  bantering and this film delivers.  The characters are well developed and the actors seem to really enjoy their parts.  Having watched the series Firefly helped, but I think anyone could understand the plot.  And there is a plot.  Lots of action and great special effects, but it is the characters you care about.
B000001G5H|5.0|I have bought most of the recent releases of Chopin's incredible studies, and I still believe that this recording comes closest to a pianistic ideal.  Pollini is stunning in his ability to convey the greatest depth and technical facility in these two transversals of Romantic piano technique and musical expression.  Some critics complain that Pollini is too cold to play this music, but I must completely disagree.  Because he does not attack the music in demented manner or disrupt the musical line for the sake of misguided \\"individuality\\" does not mean that Pollini is unable to project incredible range of this music's emotions. Of course, as a technician, Pollini has few if any who come close to his command of the keyboard. I have listened to Perahia's recording (special in many of the studies), Lugansky's (Second favorite after Pollini's), Gavrilov's, Askenazy's, Lortie's, and the list goes on. I have also studied some half dozen of these myself in the last half decade, and it is this recording that I view as being ideal interpretively and technically.  It is a must for anyone wishing to own a recording of the Chopin Etudes.
B0002XVQNU|4.0|I just don't know what all the complaints are or were about. This is just about as perfect of a comic-book-to-movie adaption as they come. Every sequence is like comic book art. The Director's cut adds the excised bits that help the movie make more sense, as the theatrical release had holes that left you wondering; and now you have that missing info. It's too bad that such a solid effort got bashed so relentlessly. The only thing you could say was \\"wrong\\" with this movie was that it didn't have that extra sprinkle of soul that would have pushed it to 5 stars, a la Spiderman 2. That would have come with the sequel, which we will probably never get because of all the crybabies.
B000025JU0|4.0|There are a few songs on here that most people will definately know right away if you're already familiar with OMD.  Locomotion, Tesla Girls and Talking Loud and Clear are all available on the OMD singles collection.  As with all OMD, there are a few lesser known gems on this album as well.  Songs like Hard Day, White Trash, and my favorite song, Never Turn Away.  Although I don't like this album nearly to the extent that I like Organisation, Architecture or their self titled debut, this is far better than Dazzle Ships. OMD never went through a time where I disliked all of their music, but there are definately alums that are superior.  This one falls kind of in the middle.  It seems like they abandoned their more introspective and thought provoking music in favor of poppier and more radio friendly sounds.  Not that this is all bad, OMD were successful at everything they attempted.
B00097DX3U|4.0|MY FREAKIN GOD!!!!! I'm reading the other reviews here.  Get over it. Don't compare bands. Damn!!! How can you compare preferences, cause that's all that it is, PREFERENCES. I like the taste of sweet, you like the taste of sour, SO WHAT! <br />Anyways, <br />this album is pretty good atcually. A lot of good songs here.  These guys are capable of doing great music, I just wished they would've pushed the envelope a little bit more. Highlights for me include, #1Zero, Dandelion, Yesterday To Tomorrow & Heaven's Dead. I came to like the songs that remind me the least of they're previous band. Good album!
B0000B1OGD|4.0|A terrific minor classic, Valley of Gwangi holds up remarkably well today.  Like King Kong, the original Godzilla, and Clash of the Titans, it's a fun film that has stood the test of time. <br /> <br />The special effects are solid.  I love CGI monsters, but the stop-motion dinos are top-notch and really cool to watch.  The scene where our heroes rope and wrangle a dinosaur is still great fun.  This film deserves a place on any monster movie fans shelf. <br /> <br />One question though.  Were there really such a thing as Mexican Gypsies?  Seriously.  I'd really like to know.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Unfortunately this album doesn't belong to that 97's music era, it was completely ahead of that time. Out of time. That is why it`s still being understood and that's also why it is rated 5 star.
B0007LCNKM|4.0|If you liked post-punk era of the late 70s and early 80s you'll like Alligator. More to the point, if you like the Psychedelic Furs you'll like this.    The good:  Inventive drumming/percussion is what propels this CD.  \\"All The Wine\\" is a great song  Great guitar sound  Lots of variety...no two songs sound at all similar.  Normal running time....CDs that run on for 60 to 70 minutes can be a chore to find what you like.    The not so good:  Like some folk, I find the lyrics detract somewhat from an overall enjoyable experience. Not really stream of consciousness lyrics like Wire does, more like embarassing poetry.    Other than that I like Alligator.
0553573403|3.0|There is something everyone who is thinking about reading this series should know, IT ISN'T YOUR TYPICAL FANTASY NOVEL. Is that a good thing, you ask? Well, maybe.<br /><br />****************************************<br /><br />You might like this book if . . .<br /><br />****************************************<br /><br />1. You would rather read about political manipulations than fighting and war-mongering.<br /><br />2. Very graphic sex scenes do not bother you.<br /><br />3. You do not require lots of magic in your stories.<br /><br />4. You enjoy well developed, detailed characters who tend to have fatal character flaws.<br /><br />5. You like a very long, very in-depth mystery<br /><br />6. You don't mind reading about the \\"grit\\" of medival life. Nothing is sugar coated here, rest assured of that.<br /><br />7. You don't mind not having a central character to root for.<br /><br />****************************************<br /><br />You will hate this book if . . .<br /><br />****************************************<br /><br />1. You expect a fantasy novel to have lots of fantasy in it.<br /><br />2. If 15 pages of action out of 200 is not ok with you.<br /><br />3. Very detailed sexual exploits offend you.<br /><br />4. You want to really care about a character or need someone to root for.<br /><br />5. You don't like really long stories (if an 800 page book makes you shudder, this one isn't for you because it only gets worse)<br /><br />6. Similar sounding names infuriate you.<br /><br />7. You don't mind keeping up with 8+ plot lines and 20+ major characters.<br /><br />*****Magic*****<br /><br />There isn't a whole lot of magic in this world. Especially when compared to something like Harry Potter in which everything up to, and including, the crapper is magical. Here is a list of just about everything magical I could find:<br /><br />1. Ancient tree spirits<br /><br />2. Ancient undead . . . things<br /><br />3. Extra long seasons. A typical round of seasons might look like this: summer lasts 7 years, fall last 3 years, winter last 5 years, spring last 4 years, summer last 4 years, fall last 6 years, etc.<br /><br />4. Children grow up faster. From the way the story is written (he never explicitly says one way or another) we can conclude that children reach maturity much sooner than \\"real\\" people do. So, a 15 year old boy is equal to a 18 or 19 year old \\"real\\" boy. Likewise a 13 year old girl is equal to a 16 or 17 year old \\"real\\" girl. It is a little odd but you get use to it.<br /><br />*****Characters*****<br /><br />Many of the characters are either stock, evil or borrowed from some other pieces of fiction. There are several who are \\"good\\", many who are \\"bad\\" and a handful whom are \\"indifferent\\". Yet, in spite of all of that it is easy believe that they are real. Martin does a good job of making them seem lifelife. So, even if you think you have seen them before they are still crafted nicely here. There aren't that many truly unique characters though and no one exists as \\"The Hero\\".<br /><br />*****Action*****<br /><br />Very limited action considering the amount of story telling that goes on. There is a tournament, a war, lots of brawling and the occasional fist fight. If you need lots of adventure go buy a comic book because this isn't for you.<br /><br />*****Plot*****<br /><br />This is a very plot driven story. The plot is interesting, don't get me wrong, but it can get a little tiring at points. Most of the time you will try and unravel the many mysterys laid before you and thus won't notice (too much) that the book is really long. Now, I am not against long books, provided there is a point to all that length. Writing just to fill space annoys me though. And while Martin is interesting, and descriptive, there are times when I think an editor should have gone though this thing a little harder than he originally did.<br /><br />So, overall, do I recomend this book? Sort of. If you can get past the lack of actionand magic then this isn't too bad of a book. Here is an interesting note, though. If Martin had taken out the 4 somewhat magical elements of this book, changed the setting to medieval Europe and modified a few names, then this could easily sit on the \\"Fictional History\\" shelf.though.

B000BMSTMS|2.0|As a HUGE Korn fan I couldnt help but be disappointed with this album. i hear too much linkin park and p.o.d. and i hate both bands. Worth having for the collection, but nothing like korn before Head left...  but hopefully this doesnt start the downfall of korn. Rock on.
0670032506|2.0|After reading David Allen's first book \\"Getting Things Done\\", I was excited to read \\"Ready For Anything\\".  I was hoping for a book that would go into more practical applications of the topics discussed in \\"Getting Things Done\\".  However, I found quite the opposite.<br /><br />\\"Ready for Anything\\" has 52 short chapters that discuss a range of topics.  While the topics are good and the quotes spread throughout are excellent, I found each chapter to be far too conceptual and not practical enough.  I wanted more specific advice.... not that the advice given was bad.<br /><br />While reading this, I found that the material was just a rehash of \\"Getting Things Done\\".  I would highly recommend you pick up that book and pass this one over.  2 out of 5 stars.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|For some reason I never heard about this series when it aired on TV and only just stumbled onto it a couple of weeks ago through NetFlix. During the first episode I was intrigued, by the second I was laughing, and at the third I was hooked. If this show had continued it might have given my favorite ST:TNG a run for it. I can't believe this show as cancelled!<br /><br />As you can tell, I'm a fan of SciFi, but I don't go much for westerns. However, the blend of the two in this series just works. Combine that with believeable characters who are intriguing in their depth of history and portrayal and add the true cohesion between the cast and you have a recipe for greatness. This show is downright fun.<br /><br />In fact, the only bad thing I can find to say about the DVDs has to do with the code behind the actual disks and not the show itself; namely that the menus are just the pokiest I've ever seen on a DVD.<br /><br />Approach this with an open mind and get ready for a really enjoyable experience. I too hope they bring the show back to TV.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|I can't say enough about SOAD.  I am speecheless with this record.  This band cannot be compared to any other musical act, except MAYBE \\"Frank Zappa & The Mothers of Invention\\".    Every song is heartfelt pure artistic expression.  May they last longer than The Rolling Stones.    Often criticized for their lyrics and quarkiness.  But that is who they are.  Their lyrical approach makes perfect sense to me.  I bet most people that don't like them, can't understand them  Congratulations to Serj, Daron, John & Shavo.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Ok, so you may have noticed that as of me writing this, there are already 1903 reviews for the Firefly DVD set of which 1785 are 5-stars (that 94%), and in my opinion this kind of rating is complely justified. After buying the DVD's and watching the enitre series in about a week, this show quickly became one of my all time favourites. The characters are all excellent, seeming to gell with each other right from the begining. The storylines are expertly written with each episode containing just the right mix of humour and serious drama. Infact, over the entire series there is not one poor episode (whcih from 14 is pretty amazing). The only annoying thing is the whole thing is over far too soon (thanks FOX), but at least the fantastic theatrical movie continuation Serenity provided some closure (and I would definitely recommend you buy the DVD of that as well).
0375507256|5.0|I started reading this book right after finishing Cunningham's recent Specimen Days. The two have several things in common, most obviously the interweaving of several separate stories into a (supposedly) larger whole. This kind of clever constructions are usually not my cup of tea (I share my misgivings about them with some of Mitchell's own characters) - far too often they merely mask a lack of sustained narrative invention. In fact I was deeply disappointed by the Cunningham, and thus approached this bulky novel with some trepidation. No need for that, as it turned out - on the contrary. This book is in a totally different league than Specimen Days. In fact, it is one of the most engrossing things I have read in a long time - the kind of book that makes you put out your bedside lamp far too late on weekday nights, and whose characters and themes mull about in your head while you are trying to work.<br /><br />Cloud Atlas consists of six separate stories, no less, which open up one out of the other, only to fold back in on themselves again in reverse order. \\"A gimmick?\\", the author himself wonders with supreme irony by mouth of composer Roger Frobisher, who is writing a sextet that is constructed in precisely the same way as this novel (with which it also shares the name). In this case, definitely not. The six stories are cleverly and meaningfully interwoven in a way that so eluded Cunningham in his similar attempt. Yet each on their own they are fully developed, unhurried, and in turn moving, inspiring and thrilling. They all center around the theme of the human will to power and domination, and the destruction inherent in it. Jalousie de m&eacute;tier, corporate corruption and greed, predatory survivalism, slavery, consumerism and whatnot drift in and out of focus as we cross the ages from the 19th century Pacific, via early 20th century Belgium, 70s California, and present-day Britain, to a horrific view of a future ruled by Asian corporations, and a future beyond that again when civilization has collapsed completely, but the saddening cycle of human inhumanity is starting all over again nonetheless. Mitchell's versatility of style and genre is dazzling to say the least. Cloud Atlas encompasses a diary, a correspondence, a kafkaesque farce, a racy thriller, a sci-fi interview, and a history written down in the vernacular from an oral narrative. This may look awfully farfetched in theory, but in fact this diversity succeeds in enhancing the message of the book and the pleasure of reading, rather than getting in the way of them. Better still, you get both happy endings and sad endings in a single book, as well as a message, or rather a question, that reverberates through all of the stories and may haunt you for quite a while after leaving Adam Ewing in Honolulu on the final page. Mandatory reading for all lovers of great literature!n when civilization has collapsed completely, but the saddening cycle of human inhumanity is starting all over again nonetheless.

0380789019|4.0|Neverwhere was a book I purchased blind to the storyline or author.  I prefer fantasy reads and have exhausted all authors known to me.  I was not enthusiastic about this title while getting through the beginning of the story.  After reading all of Tad Williams novels, I am a bit sick of tunnels!  (as I'm sure fellow fantasy readers can sympathize)  Although, I cannot fault Gaiman for the tunnels, I still feel that I did not find myself into the storyline.  Despite this, the book was consistently interesting and held my attention well. I want to stress the fact that I was always entertained while reading, but I found myself feeling oddly detached from the story (it had a bit of a juvenile feel at time and the way some parts of the story fell together).  As time went on, this book grew on me.  And by the semi-end I loved it.  It really is a unique story.  For me, not everything fit PERFECTLY, as in Tad Williams epics, but it was almost perfect and that is close enough for me.  This book was a fun read.  I will be reading more Gaiman novels in the near future!
B000C1YL1G|5.0|its all awsome lol the best song is When Im Gone and its just really really good and you should deff. buy this
B000AADYYO|5.0|I am a new Opeth fan.  I had a hard time at first getting used to the death growls, but the music is so good that I can overlook the growls.  Ghost Reveries is an incredible album.  Fast and furious, then beautiful and emotional...all in the same song.  Ghost Reveries has all of the usual Opeth elements, but this one has a little more depth.  They have added a keyboard player which gives the music additional depth.  The musicianship is amazing as always,  metal and classical, but never combined at the same time.  Mikael's voice is the best that I've heard it.  His tone is so nice, I wish he would sing even more.  Ghost of Perdition is one of the best Opeth songs that I've ever heard. <br />It is worth buying the album for alone.  Baying of the Hounds has a lot of growls, but the music moves between ferocity and tranquility at frequent intervals.  The Grand Conjuration is also a great tune.  No weak tunes here.  You owe it to buy this album and listen with an open mind.  10 stars!!!
B000B8QEYC|5.0|The \\"Amarantine\\" flower is a good metaphor for Enya's music, which seems to blossom eternally, and especially now. This new album brings the best from Enya: it is melodical, moving and touching, more than ever. The title song is truly addicting, and my other favorites are the emotional \\"If I Could Be Where You Are\\" and \\"Sumiregusa\\", the upbeat \\"Somebody Said Goodbye\\" and the instrumental \\"Drifting\\", to name a few. All of the songs follow her soothing style, rich with voice harmonies sung by herself alone, angelic melodies, and an accompaniment consisting of synthesized textures together with string orchestra. And one final favorite of mine: if you like Enya's music, you will love Arye Geiman, a very romantic composer, whose music really awakens your imagination. You can listen to it at the \\"CDbaby com\\" website.
B000BVEKO0|5.0|Korns new albulm shows the ability of this band to evolve there sound and come up with something that no one expected.  I will have to say I was a bit surprised but the albulm was awsome.  They have really hit it out of the park with this one.  Any true korn fan will love the new direction.
B000BP86OG|5.0|One big thing that I keep hearing about this album is that it doesnt sound like the first one. What the hell is up with people wanting the same music recycled over and over and over. Its happening with Korn and their new album, it happened with Metallica and St. Anger and numerous other bands. Bands evolve and change, sometimes for the worse and sometimes for the better. With the Darkness it was definitley for the better! This cd rocks harder than any othe band out there today. The lyrics are fun and loose. You will not find any lines like \\"my dad hates me\\" or my parents got divorced\\" on this cd, and the reason that mtv will not fully embrace bands like the Darkness is because they are afraid to put out different stuff. Sorry, had to vent for a second. Bottom line is if you like good old 80s style and queen style rock, pick up this album. you wont be disappointed!
B000002IM7|5.0|When I heard &#34;Goldilox&#34; for the first time, I was changed forever. Since then, I have come to appreciate King's X as one of the greatest bands in Rock and Roll, period. Doug Pinnick's soulful vocals, Ty Tabor's soaring guitar, and melodic hard rock song writing that is unparalleled make OOTSP one of the best debut albums ever. It still stands the test of time. A must for every music lover's collection.
B000BMSTMS|4.0|everybody is saying that korn has sold out and that they are \\"dead\\". people who say this simply Know nothing about music. What if korn put out yet another Take a look in the mirror type album? I dont think I would buy it. Who the hell wants to hear the same crap over and over? SYOTOS is an excellent example of a band changing it up and looking for a slightly different sound, not a new sound but just a more developed one. Lots of industrial influences too. If you liked untouchables and issues, pick this up. If you are more loyal to the first album and take a look in the mirror, you probably wont like this. If youre like me and think that all the albums are awesome, then why dont you own this album???
B000BJS4OY|5.0|I must admit that I haven't even listened to the re-mastered BTR CD. I bought this package for the live concert, and it is one of the greatest things I've ever seen. Other reviewers have covered it song by song, so I won't go there, but I will say that the piano-only version of \\"For You\\" might be the most poignant, beautiful, 7 minutes of music I've ever heard.
B000060P79|1.0|I've been waiting and waiting for this enhanced version to come out! I just couldn't get enought of these fake punks playing bar chords and whining about everyday problems. I can tell this album is a lyrical genious just by looking at the title of #9. \\"God Must Hate Me\\" has got to be the deepest most influencial song eva written. No I take that back, Perfect is. I'm also going for the writty title, No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls. Now I'll bet that Slayer could have never thought of that. Of course not. Slayer comes up with lame names like \\"South of Heaven\\" and \\"Haunting the Chapel\\". <br /> <br />Anyways, buy this album if you want a new drink coaster. This album sucks so bad that I know Good Charlotte fans that look down on this. Now that is sad.  <br />Do me a favor if you own this album/like this type of music. Please do not make any contact with me if you value your miserable soul.
B000BMSTMS|4.0|Korn's new CD is definitely worth buying.  While a few reviewers on here have listed some songs ( 10 or a 2 way, love song, open up, coming undone) as being only so-so, these songs are actually very catchy.
076790592X|5.0|Tuesdays with morrie- I really enjoyed reading this book, it shows you a whole different meaning of life.  I love how morrie was happy with his life even with knowing the fact that he was dieing. I also  liked that he wasn't afraid to talk about it and still trying to help others.  He was always happy and when he was sick he was glad   he can look outside the window even though he wasn't able to go out there.  This is such a sad but good book I think if you have nothing to do then for fun you should read this book because you might learn another meaning of life. You even might enjoy it more.  morrie said, \\"when you know your going to die, is when you start to live life.\\" <br />Everybody should have the chance to be happy with your life. <br />So what are you waiting for go read it!!!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|It makes me sad to think that the star wars prequels made hundreds of millions of dollars despite being horrible while a truly excellent sci-fi film like serenity is overlooked.  This film is the best film Ive seen since the last Lord of the Rings movie.  Watching this movie reminded me of watching the original star wars for the first time, Just awesome.
B000002UA2|4.0|Like many, many other reviewers here, this album is disgustingly underrated. It foreshadows wonderfully of what Floyd would eventually release the following year. A very thematic and relaxing listen. <br /> <br />I'd take this over the Wall any day. Listen.
B00004Y6NP|5.0|Now, you may have read reviews that question the greatness of this album. This is not one of them. <br /> <br />At the time of writing this, I own 7 versions of this album. 2 LP's (different distributers), 1 Cassette, the original CD release, the Remaster cd release, JVC's XRCD release, and the latest 20th Anniversary Edition (2 sided disc, cd and 5.1 DVD). I first remember hearing the Cassette around 1987 (5 years old), when I couldn't help but love the tunes So Far Away, Money for Nothing and Walk of Life. It wasn't for another 5 years that I obtained the original CD release. Even in the little boombox that I had, I loved to listen to those first 3 songs. I'd listen to the rest, but I wasn't much into it. <br /> <br />It wasn't until I built an audio system that I came to appreciate the beauty of the album. I knew it was recorded well, but when played through a good system, it really shined. My current setup is a Pioneer VSX-D412 (Amp), Samsung DVD-HD841 (Player), 2 JBL N28II (Front Channel), 2 JBL N26II (Rear Channel), 1 JBL S-CENTER II (Center Channel) and 1 JBL PB12 (Subwoofer). I play all my Stereo in 2.1 (Front and Sub).  <br /> <br />I can listen to this album repeating and never get bored of it. Not only is the music great, it completely changes when listened through a proper system. You get swallowed by the music. Nothing like turning out the lights, closing my eyes and just listen to the entire album. You go through every emotion throughout the album, from excitement to loneliness to hopeful to sadness and to inspiration. When this album is over, I feel purged, like a new person almost. <br /> <br />Dire Straits in NOT my favorite band, but this is by far, my favorite album. A step above (but similar to in many respects) The Moody Blues: Days of Our Future Passed.
