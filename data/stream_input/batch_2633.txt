B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Love this series along with the guild Hunter series. This book was very emotionally engaging and satisfying. I appreciated that the author did not engage in superficial misunderstandings that are usually very annoying. This book treats the reader like an adult. What a fantastic story of redemption and love. Don't know how she will top it
B003QSLW0K|5.0|She loved it. Even got her grandmother to watch it. Now she wants to see the latest version of Lilo & Stitch.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Must read. Really great suspense and action. Vince Flynn will<br />Be missed.  I hope they can finish his last book
B00992CF6W|5.0|Ok.this app is Amazing! But I suggest that children ages 10 and over should play. There are spiders, zombies, skeletons, and creepers!  And you can die n this game. So people ages 10 and over buy this game!!!!!
B001P9EQH8|3.0|From the reviews, I expected more performance from this nice, compact unit. I expected more audio quality boost. And I expected more volume boost as well. It achieves some of these qualities but I might be looking to get a higher model. Price was great!
B00BHUB11Y|5.0|We love this movie. It's a classic and we couldn't wait to buy it for our toddler. You can't go wrong.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Don't read this book if you want to believe that the bread you are picking up in the grocery store that has labels &#34;Heart Healthy&#34; is actually good for you. Seriously, don't read this if you aren't ready to give up wheat. However, if you think you can make a change for your health and weight, give this book a go for a better understanding as to what's happening inside your body every time you have a simple sandwich. Excellent book, a little technical at times, but I have no doubt this doctor/author knows what he is talking about.
B00C7O8TSM|4.0|Great collection of the concert. I only wished tht thet had included all 50 songs. Sound quality and mixing is done very well. Any Beach boy fan will enjoy this CD.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|really good game. helps teach responsibility. great for adults and children. I had it for my iphone. now I have it for my kindle fire.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|Love the D.A., but why won't Amazon allow me to stream from my IPad to the TV? Booooo! Get with the times, guys,
B006N0YWGY|1.0|There is no way to control the boat on Kindle. DOES NOT REACT TO SCREEN MOTION CONTROLS &amp; no alternate method of on screen control. Why does Amazon not do a better job of checking apps they present to subscribers? You'd think since its in their library of available apps, it'd be compatible with it devices. While that may not be the developers fault, it is their fault not to consider an alternative steering mode.
B00AAQ7LP6|5.0|All her hit songs are. on this video. I didnt buy the Blu-Ray version due to the bad reviews about sound.  I wish they had fixed the issue as I would have loved to have better sound with this DVD!  Otherwise the concert is amazing with great performances and all her hit songs!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I waited until I was lvl 100 to do the review. Just hit it and NOT A SINGLE red whistle has dropped meaning I haven't even completed the first tier of the whistles but everything else is working on its 3rd+ tier. Fix this issue and I'll gladly change it to 5 stars.
B005Z271Y6|3.0|Adele does too much talking between songs and I wish they had edited out most of her talking and focused more on her songs.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|its just challenging enough that its fun without being too hard. I really like the puzzles and the look and finds.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Doris Kearns Goodwin has taken her most unique and historical author's perspective here to present the underpinnings of our famous president and how the times and conditions of his life (and those similar influences for his presidential nomination rivals) shaped his destiny and ours as a country.  I loved this approach...I loved her book!
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Muy Buena Película, en un formato adecuado, no he tenido ningun problema con ella para visualizarla. Una adición recomendable para todos los que nos gusta LOTR.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I watched both seasons in two weeks and am ready for season 3 to come out on July 16th!<br /><br />A really great show with a solid plot that has a number of different stories going on at once.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This was great fun. I wish was that there were as much &quot;puzzle&quot; games as hidden objects- and better instructions, as some were confusing- but with the skip option that was inconsequential. The one nice thing about the hidden objects is that I played this along with my 7 yr old and he was able to complete those and I was able to do the more complex puzzles.
B006N0YWGY|5.0|Shine Runner is an entertaining and humorous diversion.<br />This game has good graphics.<br />Your fan boat appears to be indestructible. This means that (unlike many other games) you do not have to worry about crashing.<br />Driving over, and through the obstacles and buildings is a major part of this game.<br />Shine Runner is a game that I play as a fun time waster, without taking serious.<br /><br />I purchased Shine Runner some time ago, when I got my Transformer Prime. I also purchased Riptide GP which is also made by Vector Unit Inc. I purchased these games because, at that time, they were among the few games optimized for the Tegra 3 chip (hence, the good graphics). Of these two games, I play Shine Runner the most. This is because I like the humorous content in this game. I especially like the part that I don,t have to worry about crashing or damaging the boat.<br /><br />This game runs well on my Asus Transformer Prime and my Nexus 7.<br />Today it is being offered as the FAOTD (I guess I should be upset that today it is free). This means that it will cost you nothing to try this game.<br />I recommend Shine Runner as a fun way to kill some time.<br />I think that you will agree.
B008QTVNUI|4.0|Its a good show, I'd recommend it. Strange thing thou, during the credits of one of the episodes, it has competely different music than  other episode. Dont know what that was about, not that that affected the show's quality at all, just that was curiously funny. Anywho, its a good watch.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|We read this book for book club and everyone enjoyed it.<br />Easy to read and a wonderful story.<br />Made me want to go...somewhere...anywhere!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Fun little mind game. Makes you think and keeps you on your toes. Although several different ones exist now...you can't beat the original.
1592332803|2.0|I so, so, so wanted to like this book.  I thought I had finally found the answer to my lacking vegan dessert repertoire and was super excited upon opening this up.<br /><br />I have a rule:  when a new cookbook arrives, 3 different recipes are made.  The first 3 recipes have to be good on a rating scale of good (1 star), great (2 stars), awesome (3 stars), amazing (4 stars), and THE BEST __________ EVER (5 stars).<br /><br />I made the chocolate chip cookies.  It got a rating of meh (0 stars).  Then I made the lemon bars, which got a rating of good (1 star).  Then I made one of the pies, which again, got a meh (0 stars) rating.<br /><br />Thus, according to the laws that govern the entrance of any new cookbook into the coveted land of On The Kitchen Bookshelf, The Joy Of Vegan Baking was denied entry.<br /><br />May I recommend Vegan Cupcakes Take Over The World and Vegan Cookies Invade Your Cookie Jar?  Those are foolproof winners.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|overall good game. just a little irritating trying to get enough points to unlock next game. good for when you're. bored.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|It kept me reading. I wish Day had not ruined the Brett Kline storyline, I liked his contrast to Cross. However, I will continue reading to see why Cross's relations with his mother and brother, as well as his teenage sister Ireland, are frayed.
0307387178|5.0|After some hesitation I decided to read about some guys Alaskan hiking trip.  The book was far more than that.  This book was probably one of the only ones in which I actually stopped every so often to think about my own life.  I even told my wife that I thought the book was having some kind of affect on me, I did not know exactly what kind though.  The intriguing part was about Chris's desires to be without unnecessary material items.  He followed a line from my favorite t.v. show (Andy Griffith) spoken from a hobo - \\"I live the kind of life most people would love to live, if they only had the courage.\\"  While I do not respect Chris's neglect of others, their cautions, and resentfulness of his parents, it seems as though during his last journal writings he may have been figuring out these faults.  The only problem was a small but crucial error, all but eliminating the possibility of returning to civilization.  A very sad story, seemingly made famous only because of his death in an iconic bus.  But it makes you want to go there and that is what a great book does.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|More levels and it would have earned a full five star. Wish it was longer and not just trial, but Not too bad, challenges the mind.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Usually things don't shock me much, but there are some scenes in this movie that kinda, made my jaw drop. But all in all it's pretty cute.
B00001ZT6Z|5.0|Its a great studio album of Black Sabbath.<br />Tony Martin has a good voice I like very much this album.
B001NLKT60|4.0|A great addition to the first book. The character development was interesting up until the end .  I look forward to the next book in the series
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is the best game I have ever played. I am having so much fun I love it. What the good thing is that is that it is free. I &lt;3 this game!!!!
B005LAJ17M|5.0|After 24 I didn't expect something better. Homeland overreach my expectations!! I really recommend it.  I can't wait for the second season!
B006AZZPCM|2.0|It worked fine at first but now when I try to download something it force closes and I haven't Benn able to download anything same with the updated version when you fix this I will then give you 5 stars
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|fun<br /><br />fun<br /><br />fun<br />the kids started playing and showed me. I. was hooked!  great game to play alone or against an opponent to get new high scores.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much its really fun and colorful and I never get tired of it!!! I think it would be a cool version of this game how they always update it to a new place every so often it would be cool if they did a version where it's in Las Vegas and the character is running on the strip. My opinion anyways! :) Cool app though highly recommend it!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Such a good read! I felt like I was reading a movie; I could see the words turn into images in my mind. A hallmark of a great work!
B0055CJ8T2|5.0|I have never been much of a dancer but after listening to this Kelly Rowland cd I feel I can now move like Jagger 2
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|I really got lost trying to figure out the plot of this movie, to the point I gave up and just watched for the pure artistry of character play.<br /><br />You notice that actors play more than one character, but you'll be surprised to see just how many when the film ends.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Watching windows media center is the only reason I bought this app, and it is worth every penny.  It is also useful for other things, but great for WMC.
B002R5QPRI|4.0|This is a great movie one of my all time favorites who wouldn't love this ,movie great drama and good story line
B00DAXYNEI|5.0|I just love this show, and really don't think it's too far off the mark in the portrayal of modern American politics as a vicious, corrupt, power hungry game where voters are just a means to and end (and a nuisance after the votes are counted).  Modern American politics is vile, and this series captures that very well!
B000000XB9|4.0|I love creedence  great band and all time favorite songs. pretty much every song on here is my favorite song
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I can't tell you how much I enjoyed reading this book! Following Eva and Gideon's story from the beginning to this book has been an awesome journey following the story of two sexually abused victims trying to make a relationship work, with all their skeletons out in the open, Eva and Gideon fight for their love and their relationship! Worth the read!
B000O59AFW|4.0|This is a great movie one of my all time favorites who wouldn't love this ,movie great drama and good story line
B00B8PMWJI|3.0|Movie was okay. Expected it to be different. But over all was a<br />okay movie. THANK YOU. Hope to order again.
B0053O89JM|5.0|I have been watching this series since the beginning and love this show you can really get lost in the series
0738212415|5.0|I haven't drew since high school over 20 years ago. This book has taught me to draw again and to have fun. I love this book and highly recommend for anyone...
B00516ZX1O|5.0|The only wish I have about Call to Arms is that I bought it in 2010 when released. So good. My favorite racks are &#34;Hammer of the Gods&#34; and &#34;Back in '79&#34;. I hope Hammer stays in their set list for the upcoming US tour.<br />\m/
B000QFQE4U|5.0|Inspirational...never knew or understood why he is a legend until I watched this movie..looking forward to reading the book now!
B0000DYKET|5.0|I bought these sandals a week ago, and they are perfect. They comfortably fit my feet like a glove, without being too snug. They are extremely comfortable and can be worn for long periods without one wanting to take them off to relax the feet. The Newport sandals which I bought have leather straps (the Newport H2 have nylon straps). Make sure you know what you want before you buy. Considering that the Newport (leather) and Newport H2 (nylon) are both priced the same and are both waterproof, it was a no-brainer for me to get the ones that are leather.<br /><br />These sandals looks very classy and distinctive. The earlier sandals (name withheld) I owned had nylon straps, and looked like they belonged only on a beach and nowhere else. However, these Keen Newport sandals can be worn in a great many places. They are extremely durable, too. When you wear them you get the feeling that they will keep on going for years and years. Dirt can be washed off them quite readily by holding under running water.<br /><br />Regarding negatives, I really don't have any. I suppose the rubber toe cap could be made to look a little sleeker (but then it might lose protection of the wearer's toes).<br /><br />All in all, the Keen Newports are the best sandales I've ever owned, and I would recommend them strongly to whoever is considering them.
B001HNE3NO|4.0|It was a shocking,revealing, and enlightening piece of literature. Interesting from beginning to the end.<br />This is a difficult book to put down.
B00CRWJ7VC|5.0|If you liked Inception and Matrix, you'll LOVE this! Almost 3 hours, but worth it. Very deep movie you'll probably have to watch a few times.
B00005JPD0|5.0|I don't bother much with movie explanations of the arcane details behind their playing about  with reality in order to produce a film I like. This is one such case. Not a new theme, though, perhaps, a somewhat different 'scientific'  explanation as to why the tricky playing around with time and space makes perfect scientific sense. They lost me very quickly, but if I can be led to believe that detective Dick Powell could come back as a dog to catch a killer why not believe that Denzel Washington can back to try. After all, Washington is a better actor than Powell was, even though the latter's  mid-career reincarnation as a tough detective was one of my favorites at the time.<br />With 300+ reviews already on the board, there is little more for me to say than that Washington is, as usual, a pleasure to watch and the rest of the cast are thoroughgoing professionals. The story, though a bit out of left field, is admirably suspenseful.
B00C2U6G7C|3.0|This review covers two aspects of the product.<br /><br />The deluxe soundtrack itself does not disappoint.<br />The steelbook packaging is very attractive, and the Zimmer's work is exceptional here.<br />The bonus tracks on the second disc are mostly forgettable, with the exception of the 28 minute \\"anthology\\" track that blends most of the major musical themes from the movie.<br /><br />One of the big reasons that I purchased this was for the Z+ music app, that purports to allow the playback of the soundtrack using specially mixed DTS Headphone-X versions of the tracks to provide a truly immersive surround sound experience.<br /><br />I wouldn't know.<br />First of all, the Android version of the app was delayed by weeks, and once it finally did release, it is compatible with a laughably small number of devices.<br />There is absolutely no technical reason why this app should not work with either a Nexus7 or Nexus10 tablet, or a Galaxy Nexus for that matter, especially considering that the iOS version of the app will work on an iPhone 3GS.<br />Horrible coding on their part.<br /><br />4 stars for the soundtrack itself, -1 star for the horrible Android support for the app
B001EBYMB2|5.0|funny ass movie, the beginning reminds me so much of my p.d. academy days. private pile is one dumb son of a bitch.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Really best predictive text. I use my phone to place weekly orders for work and it will remember whole sentences for me. Such a time saver.
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|Action scene was cool also not a bad cast &#34;but no Jet Li in here&#34; my 17 yr old daughter really love it and that made my evening.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Seniors are not cowards... Growing old is not for sissies..... And sometimes Seniors have the raunchiest jokes, they are not all sweet little old souls.....
B004VOBIE8|5.0|Pro:  Easy to navigate from tier to tier and perform maintenance...Better than ES File Explorer<br /><br />Con: Should have a backup data function.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|five stars for being a movie you can take anyone to see.  The humor is sometimes subtle and other times very direct.<br />Best part is that every other word does not need to be edited or bleeped....
B009JZTP4Y|1.0|I'm sure for its time this film was pretty engaging. But since I didn't grow up watching the TV show and was raised with much better CG and acting in movies, this film didn't do anything for me.<br />Especially since the pace of the entire movie was no more than a crawl.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This game has great graphics, but that is probably the only great thing about this game. I thought that I was going to be able to control and ride the horse, but it turns out all you can really do is feed it, clean its paddocks, and watch it compete. That's it. I was awfully dissapointed. Really, aspirations of a great game were coming my way (T-T) If you are up for downloading a dissapointing game and using up all the storage space on your kindle, come download this game. For all you Black Butler fans, Ciel orders you NOT to get it.
B009AMAJVO|4.0|Originally I decided to watch this movie because I thought it was an action film, but in the first ten minutes I thought I had made a mistake about the genre. Yes, there is action, yet it is also a thriller, and a drama flick. There are a few action sequences which are good, but these are not as numerous as we action buffs would like. Before you know it, the story starts spending a lot of time on the relationship between Colin Farrell and Noomi Rapace, but their awkward characters keep us asking for a long time just where this relationship is going, hoping that something will develop sooner rather than later. On the other hand, when we see the bad guys we know they are really bad---they all play their parts very well. Because this film encompasses three genres, I feel that it is more prudent to rate each one separately to do more justice to the movie as a whole. I give the action part a B+, the thriller part a B-, and the drama portion a C+. The thing that saves this film for me is the excellent acting shown by the entire cast, in spite of the constrained roles assigned to them. Noomi Rapace's interesting character elicits empathy and compassion, yet the writers and director did not develop it as they should have. Maybe because the writers and director had to attend to the thriller and action aspects too. In my opinion this was probably two good story plots mixed in one---much like mixing a great orange juice with a tasty chocolate milk. Both excellent drinks will suffer. Too bad, since everyone did a great acting job.
B009NY43NY|2.0|Dead Ever After was very disappointing.  The story was repetitive and the ending was a total dud.  The only reason I finished reading the book was because of the time invested in reading  the series.
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|the way it onl y gives u 2 people is good because the ones u have to unlock r really bad! I would recamend this app to annybody
B0095P31L6|5.0|Not much of a plot, really, but the dialogue, music, artistic rendering and characters were so inventive and fun that I really enjoyed this movie. The characters are animals (really) but you quickly forget that. The HD version really showed the CG rendering at its best; the fur and feathers were amazingly life-like. Much would probably go over the heads of the under 10 crowd, but it's family-friendly. Jake the snake character might scare younger kids, but he doesn't have much screen time.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This book could be difficult to read in places, because of the subject matter, but i liked the plot twists and the final ending.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I have loved every book in this series, but this book is TERRIBLE!  The sex scenes are overdone, the plot is thin and the book ends awkwardly in the middle.  Anytime an author has to explain why the book is ending, is a good indication it is NOT A GOOD ENDING.  This book was a waste of $9.99.  I read it in 8 days missing the refund option by 24hrs.  Don't waste your money!!!!!
B0000A36J5|5.0|LOTR is one of the greatest movie trilogies in the history of mankind. If you are alive, on this planet for more than a few years, then you have heard of these movies, or most probably have seen them. If not, please stop whatever you are doing RIGHT NOW and watch all three, back to back, without any breaks or pauses, and then come back here and buy them!
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Amazing Book «3 I Loved Every Moment Of It! Nicolas Sparks Done it Again. It's An Amazing Novel And I Love It
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Oh I just loved how addictive this book is. It makes you not want to put it down because you had to see what was next. Sylvia Day absolutely captivated me with her love scenes; they  were so vivid that she made me believe that I was a fly on the wall, it was as if I was there. If anyone is looking for a fun read that will take you away to a different and place, they should definitely try out this book.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|The movie is wonderful itself. The DVD works flawlessly. If you haven't seen the film, it's worth the few bucks!
B0072OFM28|3.0|There are periods in history that I find captivating and the history of The Roman Empire is just that.<br /><br />The tale of Spartacus and the slave revolt that shocked roman society is intriguing to say the least.  When Starz announced that they were going to portray the story of Spartacus, I was hooked.<br /><br />Season 1 was a very gritty presentation of the seedy under belly of the life of a gladiator...I thoroughly enjoyed the season entirely.<br /><br />That season was then followed by the season that was out of sequence as a prequel, Spartacus: Gods of the Arena, still very enjoyable. These two seasons left me with a high level of expectation for the seasons to follow.<br /><br />With a new actor portraying Spartacus in this season 2 presentation....well...it did continue the telling and theatrical production of Spatacus. But it wasn't as gripping...it wasn't as compelling nor as captivating. It was not as gritty as its predecessors. I found it lacking. It's frustrating when when want so much to enjoy a series and yet there comes a time when you realize it won't be...<br /><br />It just was not as...<br /><br />I bought this DVD set because it was part of the story, a piece of the series. Unfortunately,  it sits unopened alongside the prequels that were everything that I enjoyed and appreciated in the series....I wish that this season had been more of what the previous seasons had promised.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|They are so much more entertaining than this (awful) book!<br />I already reviewed the book but couldn't resist adding this<br />comment as I think everyone everyone should make sure to read<br />the 1 & 2 star comments!
B00AKO93JK|4.0|I love the concept of the program, but it's a bit difficult to do the first few times until you've memorized each of the routines. A list of exercises within each routine, type of weights (light, medium, heavy) needed and a description of how to properly do each exercise would be helpful. It would also flow much better if it grouped standing exercises and floor exercises together instead of making you get up and down numerous times. Overall good program for those days when you only have a few minutes or can't go to a gym, but needs some additional information to really make it more straightforward.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great fun...for hours! Loved playing for shortcuts. Levels are interesting and keeps you guessing. Great to think through the objects.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It was really worth the money and I hope everyone enjoys it as much as I do. I've noticed people hate the skins apps  but they aren't working but  its because they haven't updated it to skins it come out soon so be patient! Great game 5/5!
193700788X|5.0|Not to give too much away about the ending but FINALLY!!! DEAR GOD IN HEAVEN FIIIIINALLLY !!!!!!<br /><br />I am in love with Sookie Stackhouse books and have not really been disappointed in any of them..... However..... the stories started to get REALLY predictable as each one went on. And the weird thing was it was as if she was not even a telepath sometimes and then there was very little mention of her little cousin or her brother. I know that there is so much going on in these books that you can't revisit everyone but still.<br />The character Sookie Stackhouse is vain, a little selfish, and very self righteous where she has nerve to mention several times over about how her brother is dumb when she has been the dummy in these books 20 times over. She often brings up his selfish ways but always thinks that someone &#34;owes&#34; her, I'm not speaking of the vamps but reg folks she knows. There us one part where Tara says she wasn't a good friend to Sookie after she had the babies but if you ask me Sookie wasn't the bestest pal.<br />All her jerkiness aside sookie is an awesome character and because of how well Charlaine Harris developed her characters and Bon Temps (ironic name) you can almost see the bar and the people in it clearly as you read.
B0064J6OMO|1.0|I would like to give it less than one star, but there's no option for that. I tried to keep an open mind but had to turn it off because it was so bad. I like both Ryan Reynolds and Justin Bateman and was very disappointed in them in this movie.
B00A9T1HUO|3.0|I love a couple songs on this CD but really like his last one much better.  Not that impressed. no

B00BIVN82M|5.0|Wonderful CD.  Michael Buble sounds so much like Sinatra. It makes me happy when I listen to it.  Love it.
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|I am glad to see Arnold return to some movies. It was a fun romp, not too serious not too silly, just an overall fun action romp. If you like Arnold's other movies you surely love to see him back on the stage.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun game and exciting to play! My daughter got me hooked on the game. I get faster everyday. I do recommend this game for all ages. No violence, just good clean fun.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I love the access I have with my phone to listen to music where ever I may be. Love It
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|Lots of fun.  A way to while away some time.  It can become addicting.  Takes your mind off daily stress.
B00DF0POXA|5.0|Obviously an amazing album, Kanye has moved beyond appealing to his audience and is making music for himself, this album is much more mature than anything else he has put out
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I cannot wait for the sequel for this book. It is an absolutely captivating novel and looks into the hearts of children.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I really enjoy the mystery of the game. Really good game! I would definitely recommend this to my friends and family

B00B7Y0206|1.0|The app started to freeze after I used it for a while and then I got annoyed and wrote this
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|A great book about overcoming adversity and the power of goodness. I highly recommend it for young adults and older readers too.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|Up until the update I woulda given this app 5 stars. Now it is very laggy, &amp;  the treasure chests are a total rip off. U used to be able to open them with sand dollars and sometimes pearls. Now, since the update every chest asks for 6pearls... and only awards you with alge or a few sand dollars. I have tons of those!<br />  Also, I'm reading in other reviews that if u own a kindle fire you can only go so far in the game before it has problems loading and running. I'm pretty upset considering I've spent actual money on this game.<br /> If those things were fixed I'd defiantly change this to a 5 star review. It is a cute relaxing game.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|You can tell that the end is near, and the loose ends are about to be tied. So many questions are left to be answered, and this is why George RR Martin is a genius! One of the best epilogues I've ever read. I can't wait for Book 6!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I like to see how different cultures live and what they have to go through in order to survive.  Such fear and poverty these people had to go through.  It mkes me grateful and somewhat  ashamed because we in America have so many blessings.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|good game, the puzzles are challenging. sometimes the touch controls are unresponsive but it doesn't take anything away from the game.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I am a middle-aged female lawyer and this book has motivated me to take some big healthy risks for myself and for my daughters. So much that Sandberg has to say resonates with me. I especially enjoyed the mix of personal anecdote, humor, and cold, hard fact about women (and men) and our professional lives. This book is a catalyst for all of us to examine how we treat women and men and how both women and men (and our children) can live more productive, satisfying lives.  Sandberg is now one of my heroes!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|A beautifully crafted fairy tale for the young at heart. Another great read from Gaiman.<br /><br />Perfect book for a stormy afternoon in a window seat.
B005LAII3U|4.0|Another reviewer said it perfectly, \\"Different enough from the original to be entertaining\\".  I am not usually a big fan of movie remakes or re-boots, but this version of the Arnold classic put a twist of the original script to make it new again.  This is not an Arnold remake, rather a fresh new look at how the original story could have gone.  Colin Farrell is great as Quaid, and the sexy Kate Bekinsale and Jessica Biel fill in the movie with good action and eye candy.  Those who may complain about it not being as good as the original, you need to stop comparing them because they are not the same movie.<br /><br />The only problem I had was with the Dolby TrueHD soundtrack.  It constantly kept dropping out.  I exchanged the movie for a replacement and it did the exact same thing at the exact same points in the film.  Amazon gave me a phone number for Sony to call about the issue (Which proves they know there IS an issue).  Sony said to go into the menu of my BluRay player and change the digital audio output to PCM, and that should fix it.  Well, I did what they said and it did fix the drop-outs.  But it was no longer a Dolby TrueHD soundtrack.  It was a standard PCM 2 channel stereo track which played through my system in the old outdated Dolby Pro Logic from the 1980's surround technology.  For me, this defeated the whole idea of having a nice 7.1 home theater system.  So I returned the second disc for a refund until they can fix the soundtrack.  I may try to buy it locally in a store, but if it does the same thing, Sony should hang their heads in shame for not fixing this.<br /><br />Sony should RECALL (no pun intended)the BluRay discs of this movie, and reissue new discs with a Dolby TreuHD soundtrack that works.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great fun exciting thrilling AWESOME game. Best app ever. Makes you use your brain. Woo I love it
B00BG23LYS|5.0|Does anybody remember Wolfmother?  They were one of the first bands to reignite the passion and love affair with late sixties/early seventies heavy rock, and had a big hit with \\"Woman\\", that while it was practically cloned off a Led Zeppelin chromosome, still had an infectious riff and still rocks today.  They had a good followup with \\"Cosmic Egg\\" and then foundered.  Part of the blame is internal problems, but Mike Patton of Faith No More and the Tomahawks didn't help them by bad mouthing them on camera, where his comment went viral.  I personally thought and still think that a person who writes a song celebrating the wonders of human feces \\"Cuckoo for Caca\\" doesn't have much room to be criticizing other bands.  Well, Wolfmother may be history, but what does Mr. Patton think of the tons of retro bands out there, good musicians who are bored with the metalcore and deathcore genres of metal, opting instead to write actual songs and actually sing?  This return to song craft was inevitable, and long overdue.<br />  Doom metal is probably the heaviest metal that still retains some melody.  Uncle Acid and the Deadbeats are on the doom borderline, but spice their recipe up with a love of Beatles harmonies (!) and a sound that, while improved on \\"Mind Control\\", still recalls the tone of early Sabbath and other pioneer heavy outfits.  It's not as delightfully trashy as the great debut \\"Blood Lust\\", but the tunes are fantastic.  Despite the silly moniker, Uncle Acid and the Deadbeats are very serious musicians, very gifted and with luck will be a major force to contend with.  \\"Desert Ceremony\\" has a beautiful quiet hook mixed in with the fuzzy chords, \\"Death Valley Blues\\" recalls the best of psychedelia, and \\"Valley of the Dolls\\" is as hypnotic as it is doom laden.  The songs have great hooks and vocal lines, the guitars are awesome, and the whole outing is a trip to where melody in heavy music still has a home.  Fans of The Sword, Ghost and Orange Goblin should be on the prowl for this band.  It will be one of the best releases of the year.owl for this band.  It will be one of the best releases of the year.
B00992CF6W|4.0|In the beginning it was super boring. But the only way to make it fun is to get the update. When you get the update, the app is so fun and turns into the exact same thing as the app on apple devices.
B00384NXX6|5.0|the outtakes and extra clips in this box set are worth the cost on their own. No spoiler here, but nobody gets all the quips and references in this movie on a single pass. You have to watch it at least three or four times to appreciate all the writers' work in this match of really funny scenes. Though each time you blush a little more cuz there's quite a case of potty mouth going on from Jay and all the rest...
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Really enjoyed playing this app. Works great on both my kindle 's. Colorful and good graphics, the voice is very easy to hear and understand.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|Pretty good movie I liked the way the actors played several characters, I didn't think it was that complicated or intense, but it was pretty good. Long movie, but worth it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Pretty interesting App. My daughter loves to pet the horse (she's 2). I am not a horse owner however I can imagine what it's like as this app captures the realism of doing so. It's more than just loving and feeding your virtual horse. There competitions and training,etc. Very cool. Would recommend if you like those types of real-time, maintenance, and imaginative types of apps. Great work to creators. Would like to see more editing options for my character.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I had begun to think that the magic I found in my childhood reading was solely due to my pure imagination as a kid. The Night Circus has put the magic, the adventure, and fun back into book form for me now as an adult. I'm excited to own this beautifully written work of art and I look forward to discovering it all over again someday in re-reading it down the road.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Very unique style allows for the story of an entire world from many different facets of perspective. Humanity and zombies
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Powerful impact. This is not like any other book I've read. The intricate web of how one Russian spy seeks asylum in Sweden, turns out to be a master crime syndicate leader. But Swedish government develops a secret agency to deal with him and his &#34;secrets.&#34; In doing this they allow him to abuse women and put his daughter in a mental health asylum for life. This secret organization then has to cover their own tracks by keeping her under control. And so this one young woman who has been abused in so many ways turns out to be the undoing of the secret agency. This is about the abuse of women and denial of women's rights and also about how a government can so easily be sidetracked into some unnecessary deceit. This book really hits the nail on the head here in the US where politicians are trying to undermine women's rights, and the government is spying on us all. One thing leads to another and the next thing you know we have the KGB and Polit bureau and democracy had disappeared. I was saddened to hear that this stuff goes on in Sweden too.
034580404X|5.0|At first, I thought it would be all about sex.  I am so glad it had more than that.  I can really relate to both sides of their demeanor towards sex and the revelations to it.  And the excitement of all the crisis they endured.  I loved it very much.  I wish their was more.  I find myself reading it all over again.  Or get his side of the story.  What he thinks of her throughout the ordeal.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|engaging and it is a good novel to make you want to read about each tape. Well written and interesting.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is the best game I have every played. its difficult but it make you think. I would recommend you play this game.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Can't believe I did not already have this CD.  Great RHCP as always.  Great songs, great music.  As always, RHCP Rocks!
B001ANYDAO|5.0|First off, the supplier did a good job shipping the book in time and in good condition.<br /><br />As for the author, he is awesome! The book is a nice read.
B002PZC8BM|5.0|Great stories, great acting.  The cast fits together nicely.  Just enough conflict and flirting.  I am addicted to this sophisticated who done it.  Jane's observations are marvelous.
0062255657|3.0|I had the pleasure of hearing Neil Gaiman speak,  and he read from this book. What a talent he is.  He is a wonderful writer, and is able to create characters and settings that come alive in your imagination.  He has done this before in the 2 other books I had read of his (Graveyard Book, and Odd and the Frost Giants).  This book, however, just didn't have a storyline to match the others.  Like others have written, it would have made a great short story, where everything doesn't have to explained and loose ends don't have to be tied up.  That's the beauty sometimes of a short story - but I just expected more from a novel.
B007SSDBBM|4.0|The acting was very good and although I am not drawn to sci-fi this was very well done and subtle
B00992CF6W|5.0|I absoloutly LOVE game and the new update the only thing is I thing mojang should have pocket edition just like computer games other than that I love it
0307951529|4.0|Don't get me wrong. I liked this book. But it could have been either half the length or had double the details.<br /><br />As someone who has started 5 businesses, I loved the variety of stories and hearing again and again about the successes. And it's not that I really want to hear horror stories of struggle, but a bit of overcoming the odds (where is the hero's journey?) would have made it richer.<br /><br />I suppose you could even get the impression that a clever idea and good web site is the formula for riches. I know that's not the author's intention and no question he did some great research.<br /><br />Here's my summary: read it for inspiration and some great tips from some pretty unique niche start ups. To that end it is excellent.
0064440346|5.0|What are those bumps in his bed? I still don't know! I've gotta calm down, drink myself some tear water tea.

B0066W1AZK|4.0|I think this is a perfect game for kids like  me who are into chess especially kids who's parent that don't have time to play
0452298482|5.0|I really found this book enjoyable and useful.  It contained a lot of insights on living that I'd heard before, but it also contained numerous new insights.  I found the book so poignant that I bought a second copy to give to my niece for her 21st birthday.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I play mincraft nonstop I want it on my kindle but the price is too Much I WILL NOT BUY IT INTILL YOU LOWER THE PRICE<br />and that is a promise so if you want me to buy lower the stupid price
B00BD2DRHW|3.0|I have had this games since April and I haven't got past the first island.  The game either doesn't work right or I don't understand how to play.
B008GGA5EQ|2.0|Honestly? I was so bored I didn't bother finishing it. \\"oHuse of the Seven Gables\\" esque; overkill andoverwritten so much clutter I lost the story line, there was one, right?  Must be me as I see glowing reviews.  Chengi seems like a cardboard cutout garlanded with what the author imagines she feels.  This is the harshest review I've ever written and I am not sure why. The book just completely lwft me cold.<br />The teaser at the beginning hooked me but didn't carry through.<br />Just not my cup of tea.
B00AAQRNQ8|3.0|Guess i never really noticed till i got this mouse( last one was an A4 Tech that lasted a good 7yrs ) how much i pick up the mouse.  The thumb grip does nothing.  It seems like the middle thumb button(5)sticks out a little farther for the thumb to grab onto when lifting it. But i end up press the 4 button almost every time. That's my biggest gripe with this mouse. The mouse sits a little higher than I'd like and it kinda leans to the right for the palm support. The wheel on the mouse stays a solid blue which doesn't match my back lit red keyboard.<br /><br />  Overall though its a good backup mouse to have.  The optical is on the spot. The adjustable weights are good. Having the option to set the dpi for presets where you need it is fantastic!  This mouse will do till i can find another one that will be a little more my style. Who know, maybe i may even learn to love it as time goes on. The review will change if this happens. For $40 i don't find it as a waste of money. Just a lil set back.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|good price, same functions as super scribblenauts and sandbox.you guys should really buy this app. for kindle fire, it only cost 99&cent;. Buy it
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have found very few flaws in this game andO have played it about 20,000 games. I would recommend it over the others I have downloaded from apple apps
B000YABS8E|5.0|The cast selection is perfect having just the right chemistry in this comical past and future scenarios.Definitely a good movie.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|I've only listened to the first 4 1/2 tracks and love this and had to write a review.  Within four seconds of starting track #1 you know this is Black Sabbath.  The album truly is so much like the first few albums.  Its amazing to hear.  Unlike other old school bands (Kiss to name one, even though I will always love their music) that say \\"This is like our old stuff!\\" and its not, this really is.  Its slow and plodding and dark and the lyrics are great.  So good to hear these guys doing great stuff 43 years after the first release.  The first half of the first song has the structure and vibe of the song \\"Black Sabbath\\" so of course its great.  Ozzie sounds awesome and not overproduced with studio effects like some recent Ozzie stuff.  Not that its bad, just never got into Ozzie solo that much.  I miss the brilliant unique drumming of Bill Ward from the first couple albums but we'll never have that from anyone again.  The drumming on this is great, but listen to \\"The Wizard\\" on the first album and you'll know what I'm talking about.  Buy it if you're a fan of Ozzie or Sabbath or good metal.  Turn someone you know onto it!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|this is the best! 5 Stars easily... and I used to be the one who said ' Twilight sucks. What's the big point'  but now I'm all squirming and exited when something is happening. So don't dish it til you try it!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Mocking jay was absolutley positively the best book in the whole entire world. No doubt if there was going to be a fourth book i souls dead it.
B0085YOD1A|4.0|A very good simple app, exactly what I was looking for. Not for anyone that is searching for an app that does everything and washes the dishes too.
0451418441|5.0|Pillars of the Earth and World Without End are two of the best books I have ever read.  I loved the story line and the characters.  They made those time come completely alive and real for me.
B0047Y17P2|4.0|good book, quick read Michael Connelly never disappoints his readers.  Light mystery keeps the reader engaged with his colorful characters
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|I hear the best of all the best Queensryche albums here on one. In this Light and Open Road are my two favorite tracks, but the two live tracks on the deluxe version are just astounding. I think they should record a live album soon of all early work. I'm really torn when an original line up is broken up. GNR is a great example- they're just GNR without Slash, Duff, Izzy, and at least on of the former drummers. On the other side of things, Journey is justa  karaoke band without Steve Perry. I think sometimes there's just an irreplaceable sound that you can't duplicate no matter what. But this, this is the real Queensryche, or at least as close as you'll get to it ever again. They really capture the genuine sound on here that made them so great in the mid 80s to mid 90s. Things change, but this is good stuff and worth seeing live.
B000JLTRIG|5.0|Ok, so I'm a Charmed fan. I came it to after the show was already over with. Still was fun to buy the entire series and watch the whole thing. Great show!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun game and great if you want to test your skills of observation and puzzle solving. Or if you're. just looking for a quick, challenging game.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I saw the movie before having read this book and as usual, the book was much better. I liked using my own imagination; seeing the story play out in my head. It was a predictable kind of story but I love happy endings.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|J love  this app. It is cool and fun to play anywhere and any time. Subway Surfers is just an awesome app and I think everyone should have it.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Her story showed what mind control can do to someone. The mind control that this man had over Jaycee was much worse than the physical. I pray that she and her family can have a normal and happy life. They deserve it.
B00C9U9YOW|4.0|QOTSA is one of my favorite bands and I have been listening to them since pretty much the beginning. This new album is decent, but it's not their best work for sure. I know determining if a CD is \\"good\\" is all relative to the listener but for me it is nowhere near as good as Songs for the Deaf, R, Lullabies to Paralyze or their self titled album. To be honest, even though this is still an OK CD it might be their worst in my opinion.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Katniss and all of the characters are fascinating and I loved reading all 3 books. Heaven help us if our planet had to go through this scenario. Power can truly be a terrible thing when it steals from and manipulates people.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|i loved this book and Chris Kyle was a true American hero who died for his country even though he was in his home state of Texas. He tried to help many soldiers who returned from the war with issues-he died trying!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Way to go Brandon. You brought home a series I have been reading for over a decade. Thanks for not leaving us hanging
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved it...I'd like to find Gideon Cross. What a male lead character! I can't wait for the next installment.
B00DGNO3WE|3.0|Like the bethinking and middle of the movie.  The end,  not that good...loving music.  Nice photography.  Good actors.  The end was... no end...
B00AQMQBKK|4.0|I wanted to learn how to play the board game, and this app taught me.  It was a little confusing at first, until I realized it was basically a more advanced version of Yahtzee with monsters.  Though that oversimplifies it a bit and might make it sound boring, it's actually not a bad game.<br /><br />But I question the randomness of the dice rolls.  They are supposed to be 6-sided dice, and more than once, I will have made 21 consecutive dice rolls without a single instance of the symbol I needed.  Seem highly unlikely on a d6 to roll 21 times without a &#34;2&#34; showing.<br /><br />Still, fun little game with good artwork and animations.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|The beginning was kind of slow.  At the middle things got interesting.  The end was good.  The actors excellent.  Like it!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It is such a wonderful series and keeps you so engrossed.  Wish you would put the rest of the Season 3 on Amazon Prime for free.
B00BKU9ZFU|5.0|At last, a singer soon to be ranked withe Big Three....Billie, Ella and Sarah.  To produce an album of this quality at this young age shows unlimited possibilities.
0061765236|1.0|I am going to write the same thing on every book I ordered! PLEASE DO NOT STICK STICKERS ALL OVER THE DARN BOOK! It WAS in good condition, and now is ruined because I cannot peel off the 'for sale' or 'new' or 'book sale' stickers!!! They were on ever single one! I feel like I need my money back because I cannot even see the title of the book or author from my bookshelf! People are like..what are those books? I am never ordering books from this seller again unless they leave off the stickers!
B0098QBEXO|5.0|Brilliant. In every sense of the word. Beautiful, English slice of life film. Benedict Cumberbatch was incredible as the cancer addled James. The story and heart of this film were so very moving. I cried like a baby while watching. Literally bawled. No shame. I definitely recommend this to everyone who has a heart or think they may still have one. Please enjoy.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Cant wait for another books to come out!! Super exciting, steamy and very emotional! Loved it very much, you wont be regretting to download it on your kindle:)

B003YL4LYI|5.0|Intricate plots within plots and phenomenally developed characters that you love and love to hate make this a page turner that you will not want to put down.  My only complaint is that I want to read it again and again to more fully engage in the fantastic world of Martin's.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Would like more levels and hints would be nice. Level 10 is a little hard. I had to go to YouTube to get the hints.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway surfers is awesome! I play this game all the time and my parents always steal my kindle to play it. But it could have more coins and less tricks on you. But other than that, it's awesome!
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Fun, entertaining, challenging.  Good game to relax with.  Must chronologically do what game wants, but still fun.  I recommend this to adults more than young adults.
0061684384|5.0|This is a great book and it was in great shape! I really enjoyed it. I would recommend buying it.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Laugh out loud funny read! I love Tina's humor on SNL and really enjoyed her book. My Fifty Online Dates is another funny book that I just read about dating that had me laughing too. Well done Tina!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Entertaining.  Only 10 rooms before it ends though. Could be more interactive instead of just tapping. Only takes a few minutes to get through as is.

B008XG1X18|2.0|Whwn accessing the Pinterest page via the internet, there isn't &quot;mobile&quot; version.  It's hard to see all the tiny icons, loading glitches everywhere, etc.  This app is the perfect way to use Pinterest on a phone or Kindle.... whwn it's working.  The app crashes constantly, and sometimes refuses to boot up in the first place.  Uninstalling and then reinstalling the app helped temporarily, but since the last time I had to uninstall the app, it is now refusing to reinstall.  Fix the bugs soon!  I miss you,  Pinterest!
125000098X|5.0|Best Kept Secret is a very Good story,<br />It is well written,<br />It is a page turner,<br />ANd it's keep you asking more questions<br /><br />Can't wait for the next Chapter
B00CF34B2I|4.0|I've played this in the Kindle Fire HD 7\\" and it runs amazing. As with anything, there are some good things, and some bad things. Thankfully, in this case, the good things outweigh the bad ones. Let's break it down.<br /><br />What's good about it:<br /><br />(For regular MTG players)<br /><br />-Great adaptation from all the console versions. I can hardly tell the difference. Graphics are A+.<br />-It's the best Magic: The Gathering game so far. Owning MTG: 12 and 13, I gotta say this is a huge improvement. There's finally a mode to let you build your own deck however you want it, but still posing a challenge. You have to use boosters in order to build your deck, so it's not about making a powerful cookie cutter deck you can find how to make online; it feels well with the sense of strategy.<br />-As with all previous games, the art is wonderful; but I'm sure most players are already familiar with this part.<br />-The tactile controls are responsive and not overtly complicated. I'ts easy to get used to them, and by moving the digital cards with your fingers, you really do feel like having an original gameplay experience similar to real life.<br /><br />(For new players)<br /><br />-The tutorials are one of the best out there. If you're looking to learn how to play, I think this is your safe bet. Your buddy can teach you, sure, but he won't be available anytime you want him to. Now, with this baby you can play anytime you want and increase your knowledge with all the helpful information.<br />-Get familiar with the Magic: The Gathering universe. There are great cut scenes and insight so you can get familiar with the lore of this fantastic universe.<br />-If you're trying to start in the physical game too, you get a special card! Might not sound like a lot, but well, it's special tin foil and what not... that's a win in my book.<br /><br />(For both)<br /><br />-This game is challenging to new players and veterans. And I don't mean with that, that it is a frustratingtype of challenge; this time around I feel the difficulty is as balanced and as fair as it can be.<br />-Great replay value, although still not perfect. One problem I had with games like this is that, they can become repetitive. And let's face it, this game is all about playing the trading card game, which basically means doing sets over and over. Now of course, there's that aspect, but you still get so much modes to play on and such liberty, that I feel it adds to keep my interest in the game.<br /><br />Now, let's move on onto a few negative things:<br /><br />-The multiplayer mode is disappointing. That's actually the main reason I'm taking away a star. In the trial version, that option is locked, so you don't get to test it. Once I bought the game, I was excited thinking I would be able to play online against other players in my tablet. Turns out you can only play locally with bluetooth.<br />-This game will drain your battery! If you're taking a ride home in public transportation that will take an hour or two, feel free to play all you want; but if you're on your way to school, university or work (or any other place) and there's nowhere to recharge your device, then beware.<br />-Playing this too long made my device get very hot. So maybe the safest thing to do is let it rest after some game time.<br /><br />Overall, it was worth my 9.99 bucks, and I hope some further updates (if there are any) would tackle some of the bad stuff to make it even better.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|Same thing as in Floors Escape...it was very frustrating. I would click on the object and it would appear but then nothing would happen, a few directions would be nice.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|My husband saw 2 episodes on PBS at the end of season 2 and wanted to see more.  I ordered Seasons 1 and 2 and we had great times watching together.  He is trying to be patient awaiting Season 3's release
0062255657|5.0|I pretty much love everything I've read or listened to by Neil Gaiman.  Some initial reviews I had glanced at made me worry I would be disappointed with this.  I wasn't. I loved it.  It is another world, created by Neil Gaiman.  A story about a child (and grown-ups), but definitely not a children's story.  And just close enough to real life to be unsettling.  So in a way, typical Gaiman.  Which I guess is a good thing.
B004132HZS|5.0|Didn't see PBS broadcast but heard good things about this series.  Got Seasons 1 and 2 for my husband.  We had a great time watching both seasons.  Great adaptation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's works with delightful more. Twist to episodes. Love the humor.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|You can so get addicted to this game because as your shark eats it grows and matures! At first I used the stylus pen but it was hard to keep tapping it on the screen. So, I tried tipping the screen (which gets calibrated first) and OMGosh, it is so fun! You can eat everything that moves in and out of the sea - jump up to get the birds - but some things kill you or sting you (jelly fish or land mines) so you have to eat it faster - oh and coral makes you die too - I recommend it to adults not kids under 21.
B004FOA84A|2.0|The game is fine and entertaining... for the first level. After that, I could not do anything else. It seemed that there were no other levels or challenges after the first level. Boring.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Good movie to keep my kid entertained for the summer break. She has watched it a few times already Iron Man rocks!!.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I had no idea what to expect from Mr. King when I started this book, but I have always been interested in the JFK assassination. I was not at all disappointed with story. I loved how King wove his story around and through the facts of the event. In spite of the length of this book, I read it quickly because I didn't want to put it down. Good read for anyone interested in the JFK assassination.
B004GCQ2WS|5.0|Who doesn't like David G.  I love to dance and I love to sing and this CD fit the bill.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's amazing I feel ecstatic for when I play this intriguing game!it's fast and challenging.it's one of the best apps!
B000JMKQX0|3.0|If you're going to consider buying this book, the first thing to decide is whether you're a lover of the zombie genre. If you've been infected with the obsession of the undead, you have the constitution to absorb the colorful content of this story that sounds as it was intended to sound--like a piece of history. Depending on where you are on the spectrum of zombie fascination, you could love, hate or be indifferent to Max Brooks' creative brainchild. If you're not a fan of this growing artistic form, then you shouldn't waste your time unless you are the rare person that can try something new and appreciate it on its own merit.<br /><br />There is plenty of merit to appreciate. The compilation of the interviews that comprise this oral history is a realistic mosaic piecing together the global catastrophe. Intentionally done to show the story in small snapshots, it has all the elements of a good documentary. The wide range of characters make for a host of voices providing a variety of accounts of the war. Well written, especially considering the many types of people providing the information, the book showcases the author's talent with the written word.<br /><br />For my part, I'm not on the zombie bandwagon. That's why I am not enthusiastic about World War Z. If you love the genre, I would say you should be able to sink your teeth into this production and come away with satiation of your healthy appetite.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|i like bananas, but this is no banana. This is a peach, a good peach that is crunchy, yet juicy at the same time. But it'mine so go find another one
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I played this game for about two days straight. Love it. Gets you to use your brain.<br /><br />Thanks make more levels soon please.
B003XREL98|2.0|At first I tried to dismiss the many mistakes in grammar as perhaps a British way of spelling words differently. But as they continued to occur more and more frequently, I realized it was simply the poor quality and lack of effort put into the typing up of this kindle book.<br />It's difficult enough to endure such boring literature as this  in the first place, grammar errors disrupt my fragile focus as well as confuse me as I try to make sense of this long jumble of words. Honestly, I wish I had read the reviews first, this way I would have known to buy the actual hard copy, even if the kindle version is normally more convenient.
B000HZD0CS|5.0|A great part of the Trilogy
B00CM9JKQM|1.0|JUST LISTEN,BAD, SUCKS, HORRIBLE, DEPOSIT THIS IN THE GARBAGE. 5 STARS WOW!!!!!!! WHAT A HUGE DISAPOINTMENT, TODD LATORRE JUST AWFULL. I wish I could say something positive about this release, but!! It does nothing to move you at all. The music and the lyrics go no where on every song. Weak riffs by Whip, and I have no idea what Rock was trying to accomplish. Eddie what happened to your signature bass lines. I do not even have to mention the other guy/BAD! Sorry everyone I recommend to pass on this, but I to felt compelled to support this band as I always have and you will probably do the same. All I can say is good luck with this release.UGH!!!!!!!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|this one made me laugh out loud quite a bit...highly recommend to all the ladies out there with a great sense of humor!
B00D2K40WY|4.0|Pretty good but not really free only a portion of it. It isn't that expensive though. Sometimes it stops and ends in themiddle of the game.
B000063DFN|5.0|Its cool to buy cds now, nobody wants them. Also the digital copy does not contain Rime of the Ancient Mariner.
B00CLZ48FA|4.0|11 year old daughter loved it.  great visuals  love anything wizard of oz.  flying monkeys might  scare ypoung ones but is brief, much like orginal wizard of oz movie.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|The book doesn't really grab your attention and its not hard to put Dow, and when I finished  it I didn't want to come back for more. Other than that is was very nice and well-written .
1594746168|3.0|The book itself looked like new. I received it in a timely manner. I did not care much for the story or the drawings. Was not what I expected content- wise. Actually disappointing.
B00008BXJ6|5.0|I am a big fan of ACDC, so I am starting to create a collection of the old ACDC . This Record has many of my favorites ACDC songs in the great voice of Bon Scott.  Nothing as heard TNT , It´s along way to the top (if you wanna rock and roll) or High Voltage in the old school style of ACDC. Also the presentation of the disc and the photos are of a high quality. Totally recommended
1781162646|4.0|Obviously not a typical Stephen King novel. Good entertaining story. A little disappointing that there was not more horror involved. More like an average mystery story. I liked it just the same.
B0045DO8LK|5.0|I received this cd as a gift of my mom in 1999. Thsi was my first cd of Pearl Jam. Sinc ethat moment i become into a Pearl Jam. The most of the songs of this record are great, including the anthem DO THE EVOLUTION. I lost this record, so I decided  buy it again. For my, this is the last GREAT CD of pearl jam. Recommended for those that love the grunge style of 90s.
B001VNB54A|5.0|Outstanding cinematography. First rate, convincingly accurate, and deeply immersing sound fields. A moving, powerful, and yet nuanced sound track that does loving justice to the young Americans who stood tall before their feral, ruthless, and heinous Japanese enemy of that terrible era. Competent acting, and nearly 93% Historically correct. The dialogue is taken verbatim from the men (boys) who lived it. Men and Women who are beyond the comprehension of the Obama Regime.  How can you go wrong? This  one is a keeper.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this!  I really like puzzle games like this!  Just wish there were more rooms, because it ended way too soon for me!
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Love watching back to back episodes of one of my fave shows. Full of characters you live to hate like Cercri and King Joffrey!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I can play it for hours and have no pressure about any thing like in timed games its cool yet exciting
B00785P2QC|5.0|love it<br /><br />love love love love this game very addicting and good for any age group...try it you'll will love it
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is the best horse game i think in the world i love the first horse buetey she is awsome
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game and that it changes at different levels so it isn't the same all the time. I like the way it changes cities. I have been to Tokyo, Miami, and Paris. This game is so much fun and I think f everyone should download it. The mystery boxes are fun to get also
B009T8XBBO|4.0|I really like this game. It is fun and strategic in nature. I just love building my castle. The little men that run around gathering the things are too cute. You will have lots and lots of fun playing this game. I recommend this game.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|It is amazing colorful, fun, interesting with many dragon types from the basic plant dragon to the legendary dragon kairos.  It also has so many dragons to collect. I brought my tablet just so I could download this app. it takes up a TON of space. mine takes up 692MB and it's still growing.
B00881PTRC|3.0|My husband told me about this game and it's okay but not for me. However, it is funny when the hangman makes funny gestures when he dies or when you win. If you like words this is the game for you.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Should have read the book before I watched the movie. I was so confused during r the movie. Aaaa a
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really enjoyed this game. It provides enough of a challenge to keep it interesting and fun. I was disappointed to finish all the levels so quickly because I like the game so much I could keep playing for many hours. More levels please!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Good and not bad better than sex awareness and play this game every day. ok  ninjaswager6@Gmail s xxx swag also good
B00AWKZSNM|5.0|Just want to start off saying I'm currently in Afghanistan and needed a way for my Ipad to connect to my hard drive. I sometimes have to travel, and don't like to lug around my laptop. The last trip I was on got so boring because I had so much down time and nothing to do, as soon as I got back I ordered the iUSBport. I just hooked it up about 30 minutes ago and connected my 2TB WD Passbook to it. The initial SSID is iUSBport, I connected to the wifi network the iusbport was transmitting, opened up my chrome browser and one of the pages that were already opened automatically refreshed, I selected the &#34;C&#34; drive, and opened my movie folder and clicked on a random movie (which was Cop Out), took about 10-15 seconds before the movie began to play, but it was flawless. I now can pack much lighter on my trips and not be bored, and definitely recommend this to anyone that wants to connect their tablet to a hard drive!<br /><br />I will update this review after some more time with the iUSBport.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|It keeps glitching and causing trouble on my Kindle Fire. I have uninstalled and re-installed it a few times, keeps happening. I love it otherwise but I can't deal with continual error messages that won't stop until I uninstall it. Sad - was really hoping to be able to use it to keep up with my bible reading. :(
B00A8ECU24|5.0|The graphics and such are amazing, but ive nodiced this game also has a learning experience within. Financing and saving your bits and gems. This can actually help you learn to save money in real life. In the game, you need 35 gems to get Rarity. So far, i haven't gotten to the Rarity objective yet i have enough gems (39 gems) to buy her and didn't spend a penny? Many of you reading are asking, HOW??? Well in the beginning of the game, you start off with 10 or 15 gems. As you level up, find Derpy, and complete certain objectives that give you gems, your gems will increase. Now the thing to it is that you cant skip any objectives that you can do unless it is impossible (like being absolutely impossible and not because your impatient and lazy). Dont spend gems on houses being built faster (again, thats being lazy and impatient). Lastly, level up as many times as you can with shops and objectives. (this may take time but again, it depends on you being lazy and impatient). I have enough gems to buy Rarity and so should everyone else. How you spend your money in real life may be the reason why your having problems in the game (i dont know your situation but it is a theory. I DONT KNOW WHO YOU ARE. IT. IS. A. THEORY.) Spend your money and gems wisely if you are going to buy this game.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Enjoy it much more on my Kindle Fire than on my computer. The game is a bit confusing, so many options and things to do but what I find to do is lots of fun.<br />Wish you could get credits faster - I know they are just trying to make money but it's a bummer that they add up so slowly and the cards get more and more expensive. Oh well, if they gave me more credits faster I would just waste more time playing so it's probably for the best.
8866130923|5.0|it's just as pictured.. I love it.. small enough to fit in my bag, big enough to hold all the information I need it to.. and not cheap.. so it's not falling apart on me..
B0089LOG02|5.0|Is that the ending seemed a bit rushed.  I was fascinated with this portrayal of a piece of American history I knew little about.  I felt as though I, too, was taking the journey with Vivian.  I'm looking forward to reading other novels from this author.
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|It was wonderful to see all these great actors again. Thoroughly enjoyable film. Maggie Smith started out playing her usual crusty self but then, fortunately, she was allowed to develop a bit. Tom Courtenay was excellent.
0143039431|5.0|Classic lit that still holds up today. Very well worth the read - I still recall reading it for the 1st time in high school.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|This book was ok but definitely not as good as the first two.  It seemed to drag out the story-at points I was ready to put down the book.
B002Q4TKAY|5.0|The best live touring band in the world, The KIllers, bring an epic show to the greatest Rock 'n Roll town in the world.  The Royal Albert Hall cannot even contain Brandon and the boys in this live album.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is very well written.<br />I think it was the best book ever.<br />I can't wait for the second movie.
B000IDGDPA|4.0|I enjoyed this movie very much.  It kept me interested until the very end.  I liked the actors, and I think it is worth renting.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft pocket is really fun but it really needs a update to make it MORE  fun. In the update there should be pressure plates buttons iron doors and levers that's it that's all that it would make it more fun.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I need more Crossfire! So much better than Grey... This is more real. The characters, their reactions and everything about them is so much more real! I love it. Can't wait for the next one.
B004LR5K0I|5.0|There's over a 100 songs here and at least 50 sound like hits. Of course during the 70s Elvis was just considered old fashioned. Then as now DJs weren't interested in musicians who'd been around for more than 10 years. Living in Memphis in the 60s I rarely heard any Elvis on the radio. But 40 years and many box sets later Elvis is now rightly regarded as a legend and the trendiness of radio programmers is totally irrelevant to any who would like to appreciate a lot of great music that needs no radio promotion.
B004EPYZPS|5.0|I always love these type of movies. Shared a afternoon watching with my parents, relaxing and having lunch. It was exciting, made you jump at times and a great story.
0060254920|4.0|This was one of my daughter's, and granddaughter's favorite books. It shows imagination and let's a child know that children can say NO to their friends when they want the child to do things that they don't want to or shouldn't do, that the child is in charge of his or her own life. It also shows a child that even though they discipline you, your parents care about you and keep you safe and secure in their love. The illustrations are fun and the text is simple and flows well.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It made my commute seem shorter. I can use my phone to read many books that i downloaded free from amazon!
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Wow, just wow! We have all waited for so long to discover the identity of &#34; the Ghost,&#34; and now we know. Will the most powerful Psy in the net, rule for good or evil? This book is a game changer, and I can't wait to see what's next. If you are a fan of the series and haven't read &#34;Heart of Obsidian,&#34; start now. It is a must read. I you haven't read the series, you're really missing out, because Nalini Singh is one of the great storytellers out there today.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|its a fun game. some levels are very easy while some are more difficult. more like the 100 floors game but some of the levels have other rooms to explore.
1426308469|5.0|Bought it for my great nephews,they love there r 3 yrs old. Beautiful illustrations and very informative and colourful. Please give me the name of some of the other books by national geographic  for 3 yr old thanks
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I have seen some reviews about adding this and the kindle does not turn on anymore but I don't have this problem on mine. kindle fire is known to give out on you regardless of what app you install. its axnice feature showing what you specifically have battery for and how much time you have like if you want to watch videos or music or even play apps this lets you know if your going to need to bring your charger on a little trip to the mall or store. since I downloaded this app I have reassurance. that my battery will last as long as I need it to when I go run errands. without having to worry about bringing the charger along
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a fun game that anyone can play.  My 4 year old lives it as much as I do.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|Entertaining...<br /><br />Spoiler Alert:<br />So glad that they are not brother and sister though it's obvious the author plans to drag out the \\"big reveal\\"...less grossed out so I can enjoy the story more.
B000002O4X|4.0|This is a favorite sound track. I have wanted to own it for a long time. A friend suggested I try Amazon and I am very pleased and play it frequently. Thanks.
B00B9HEAVS|5.0|Great songs...love Inna and her music.. great CD and songs... listen to it all the time, never get tired.. my Mom loves her also
1415919704|2.0|I'm not saying that the book was bad but I was unable to continue with this book.  I was listening to the audio version and 35 minutes into it, it started over at the beginning.  I know that's not any reason to give two stars, but the style of writing/reading being very biblical, I couldn't do it.  I've heard so much good about the movie, maybe I'll watch instead.
0071762345|5.0|I am a copywriter. One of the skills clients expect Copywriters to have in their tool box these days is Social Media Usage. I'll keep this as my go - to reference for Social Media Usage. If I were teaching a class on Social Media Usage, I would use 'Likeable Social Media' as a textbook. You are not only told what you should do, nor only how, but why. You are also given Real World case histories that you can actually go to computer and take a look at.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|This app lets you play Magic the Gathering, it does this well though with a limited card selection. It can serve as a wonderful introduction for those just getting into Magic or wanting to play it on the fly. I am writing this review because the app told me to.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I can't believe this series could get any better, hot, sexy, and edge of your seat type of book.  I am so looking forward to the next book in this series, unbelievable read.  Read the book in a week
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Love this alarm...will never oversleep again! Terrific choice of alarm sounds. I especially like that I can let my Kindle be in sleep mode and still be awakened.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I'm glad there's still another book because so much happens in this one. Sylvia was right in her own summary of the book, it's exactly what you wanted to read about characters at this point in the story.
B00064VR0W|5.0|great concert, wish i had been there! rod stewart's range was amazing. i will be buying another rod stewart video.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I'm not really sure why everyone is being so hard on this book..I though it was pretty true to the first two books plot. A natural progression in Eva and Gideon's love story. I was a bit disappointed in the ending after expecting a trilogy.. and it just ended without much momentum..but I don't actually mind reading more if their story.. I enjoy their relationship and watching the character growth.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Just when you think you know how you would handle a situation, you find a different point of view.  This series has made me think about some of my own life choices and how I would handle situations.  I love the actor interactions and the story line keeps me guessing.  Julianna M.  is brilliant!
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|All the elements that originally made Queensryche a unique band are here in spades. Huge sound field, excellent musicianship, very interesting songwriting and slick production. While not a concept album the music is cohesive and just flows from track to track and it's great the band got Jimbo back at the controls. My only minor quibble is the mix is a little hot at times and the compression could have been backed off a bit (it's certainly not my audio system at fault here) but it's a rock album were talking about. Deep recording here and a lot to digest, heavy rotation required. The best thing you could do for the band now would be to call your local rock radio station and request the new Queensryche! This is the real Queensryche the one we've been waiting for...
B002DQLGHU|5.0|This is one of our favorite movies.  We went to watch it with our kids and found that our VCR copy was broken, so we decided to order it as instant video.  The quality was good, and you are allowed 2 days to watch it before it expires.  We enjoyed it again.  It is so fun to see the actors when they were little kids in this first movie!
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|I think that this game is fun. But it really aggravates me when I am still playing it stops the game&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; So it is fun for the most time :/
B007SGM084|3.0|just so you know this is not 3 separate books that you find in your kindle, instead it is one book with all three combined. you can skip to each book in the table of contents. me personally, i prefer they be 3 different books :(
0785152466|4.0|More of what I love in Kick-Ass.<br />Millar follows up where he left off in the first book and follows through with more on a bigger scale.<br />Not for children.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|super fun and delfinitely makes the time pass. it says I need to write more about this app...wtf..there shouldn't be minimum words to write about an app...its fun and runs great on my Samsung galaxy s3 =P
B006ZB3V2C|4.0|This is a great app for &#34;white noise&#34; or relaxing sound/music to have in the background. The photos are nice, too.<br />Also, the plug-ins (for more loops and options) are free. However, the white noise plug in breaks up instead of a continuous loop of sound, but hopefully the developers with fix this soon. Very good app overall.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|It's a fun game and I would consider it to anyone who likes racing games and others!!! I play it on my kindle fire and I think it's best on that.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game was beautifully designed.  The puzzles were challenging but solvable.  I loved that it wasn't like some of these room games where you are just tapping around hoping to hit on solutions, and that more gestures were required.  Can't wait to see what they do next.
B004LDLI0S|5.0|I've read the other translations and this one is the best so far! It's much easier to understand and I'm not even a native English speaker!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game with a lot of ease of use, starts up quickly and closes quickly (which I find to be a huge bonus in any app!) and very enjoyable. Wish games like this had more animation, but very good for what it is!
B000035P5E|5.0|If you have never seen it this is one of Ken's best! Love Donald Sutherland! CD was in perfect shape. Arrived very quickly. Thanks.
B000002I69|5.0|Very happy with CD. Will purchase in the future. Have looked for this type of music other places. First of many in the Jazz set.
B00992CF6W|2.0|Too small maps cripple this game's potential and replay value. Any player will find that each map can be fully explored in less than five minutes. This game places shame to the Minecraft name lest it is improved.
B0061QD82E|5.0|How can you not like Lady and the Tramp.  It's a Disney classic with a beautiful story, artwork and music.
B00CGPPMKU|4.0|I have only installed the free app, just to give it a go. I was so amazed at the different types of effects I can get with such an application. I will be purchasing the full app as soon as I can get back onto the computer.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|This is a different thought in a book, I will continue until it's finished, but I am not enjoying it.  Very oppressive I feel, and I prefer books that are more upbeat.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I have been told to insall this app for a while but have been hesitant to do so. Since braving the world of reading apps, I have finally installed kindle and have been surprised with it's versatility. I would recommend this app to anyone who requires a easy to use, and easy to read application.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I'm always looking for new games like puzzles and games to keep you thinking. This is a pretty good app. Was disappointed though that there were only 6 rooms.
1616550414|5.0|I love this book, great quality, illustrations and information about the Zelda world. Good deal for collectors. It was delivered on time and in great conditions.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Must read series! Bared to you was suggested by a friend, and from there I was hooked! Can't wait for the next
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good game but only 10 rooms - mid level puzzles<br />Great time waster that makes you think<br />I got it free - but worth buying.
B00C2IN7CG|5.0|I am a big batman fan and I love the steel book design and being able to watch batman in blu ray
B009G41CG2|5.0|THIS IS A LOT OF FUN AND IT CAN BE PLAYED WHILE I AM WAITING FOR THE KIDS TO GET OUT OF SCHOOL, WHILE I WAIT IN THEN DOCTORS OFFICE.  WAITING WITH THIS GAME IS A LOT EASIER
B0050DIWFC|3.0|The book was well written and the author did a good job of character development.  The ending left a lot of questions unanswered and should provide a lively discussion at book club.
B00BD6EJRK|4.0|I started with the free app and soon found out that I had to buy the pro to do what I wanted with my pictures.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game, but the bad thing about it is I CAN NOT PUT IT DOWN !!!!! Once I start I don't stop All day long. !!!!!
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I enjoyed the series while it was on the air.  When the collection arrived, one of the discs would not work.  I contacted Amazon and they sent out another complete series collection the next day.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|This game is really fun to play and is highly addictive. I'm more of a console gamer so it is saying a lot that I find time to play this. I highly recommend this. It is certainly one of the better free games I've played/tried that's available on the app marketplace.<br /><br />-Edit-<br /><br />I have been playing this game for some time now. An issue that I've been having is with the alternate outfits for the characters. There is this weird graphical issue where the wireframe is visible. I contacted customer service quite sometime ago and this issue has not been addressed. I would resort to uninstalling and reinstalling the app again but too many people have said that you lose everything if you do. It would be nice to be able to use the alternate outfits but as of now it's not possible. Once this issue is fixed I'll happily change my review back to 5 stars.
B003E74B24|5.0|I was really surprised what I learned about this man and what he had encountered in his life. Made me appreciate who he is as a person.
B00D6BQG1W|4.0|This was funny for a zombie movie,It has good FX ,and some action parts also.I would watch this movie more then once.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It was a story of forgiveness and healing. I've always loved flowers and enjoyed learning what they represent. They've always had a healing effect on me, working in the dirt. I guess this book just spoke to me personally. It made me want to get to know the meanings much better. Victoria is such a flawed character but you can't help but root for her.
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|It was really good.  I liked seeing the background of the Wiz  Thumbs up!! I will enjoy watching it again.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love the entire series, no buts about it! I can't wait to see what surprises season 4 will bring.
B004YM6JK0|5.0|I love this show, it's my absolute favorite show on tv! The Winchester brothers are the best ;-) I started watching this show with my sister and it became a tradition for us to watch it together. I love the Winchesters (especially Dean), the Impala (big muscle car fan), the music (big classic rock fan), and urban legends. This show has everything!
B00821PCJS|5.0|Greatly entertaining. The premise of the story is similar to The Walking Dead. Careful: you will have a hard time stopping after 1 episode.
B0019I6WDG|5.0|This movie is fun to watch! I haven't seen it before I bought it, and I'm very happy with my purchase. I bought it because I'm pregnant and I love watching pregnancy movies right now.
B004UPAN6W|3.0|The movie was a fun watch but in my opinion did not live up to the potential of the story. If you've read the graphic novels/comics of the origin story and \\"Weapon X\\" it doesn't hit the mark. It is however an entertaining movie.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have found out why people rave about this product; instead of one or two books I can carry thousands.
B000V7H7HG|5.0|we purchased this fence with the animals and barn for our grandchild age 3 at christmas. Its now July and he still plays with it every day. It is kept in the livingroom because he uses it so much. Very good quality.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Fun and addictive! Great for long car rides, airline travel, etc...Lots of fun! Have your batteries fully charged, and plenty of time because you won't want to put it down.
0670022705|4.0|I love this book and have passed it on.  The more we know history the better we can interpret present life!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was the most beautiful book I have ever read in my life. It's not like other books, Chbosky makes it easy to relate and feel good about yourself no matter what your like. I have learned to look at things in a different perspectives but that it's okay to be who I am.
B001AEF6D6|5.0|Dude, hey, Donnie's ashes are spread at Point Fermin, San Pedro, California. A rightious beautiful place on the end of Los Angeles. Also, good story man!
0515142247|4.0|Keeps you interested the whole read! The action never stops and extremely entertaining.  Makes me want to read the next one.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|I expected more from Grisham.  I won't bother going into why I rated this novel so low.  He summed it up himself in his own words in the afterword.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It was awesome just not enough rooms to play. It only had ten rooms. I love this game, wish there was more to play.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this book (and stayed up way too late finishing it). Oh, to be young, weird and experiencing first love again!
B001GCUO5M|5.0|This movie was one of the best movie's ever! It's hard to understand but I got part of it fast. It's sad, romantic, thrilling, and also scary. I would recommend this to my friends and family.
140053271X|2.0|I really like the Nook Simple Touch and the way it displays e-books. The problem for me has been fairly consistent problems with functionality. The firmware on the device as delivered didn't work at all. It was appalling that a brand new factory version's touch screen did not accurately respond to where I touched. It took days of trying to connect to wi-fi because of this. I immediately installed the firmware update, and that seemed to work. But it still gets unresponsive often, reverts back to the homescreen or settings panel in the middle of reading.<br /><br />Thus, this device, which is not accepted for return by the seller I bought it from, is infuriating and largely unused. I keep looking for a new firmware update to finally solve this issue, but I doubt B&N will have any forthcoming.<br /><br />Update: I think the problem I described above is a flaw with my own device and not about firmware. I have since purchased a Kindle and I couldn't be happier with it.
B005IZLPMY|4.0|Captain America: The First Avenger could not have possibly been more pro-American--in the best sense of the term. More than just being set during World War II, the film captures the same patriotic spirit of war movies that were actually made then. And it could not possibly show greater respect for the character whose story it tells. In some ways, it seemed less like a superhero movie than a History Channel bio pic or Ken Burns documentary about one of our nation's greatest champions of freedom.<br /><br />The primary source of the good will this movie generates for the U.S.A. is actor Chris Evans' portrayal of Steve Rogers, the man behind the mask of Captain America. Evans' performance had the exact combination of earnestness, determination, humility, guilelessness and unfaltering commitment to serving the greater good that I consider the defining traits of the character. It's these attributes, and not the superheroic persona and outfit he eventually adopts, that make him a perfect embodiment of how Americans, and the rest of the world, once saw this country.  As Evans said in an interview, \\"The movie is about values, morals, and someone standing up for the right thing. It's about someone fighting for justice who puts himself last and compassion first.\\" Once Steve Rogers is transformed from 98-lb. weakling to super-soldier by Dr. Abraham Erskine (wonderfully played by Stanley Tucci), as Captain America he uses his military might less like the world's policeman than its big brother, coming to the rescue when other nations are getting pushed around by Bully States. And like a good neighbor, he never butts in where he isn't invited or overstays his welcome.<br /><br />As I see it, Captain America: The First Avenger is nothing short of a nostalgic love letter to our country: not so much the way it is, or even the way it was, as much as the way we've always wanted it to be. It celebrates everything good about America--from its desire to spread democracy to its scientific innovation--but ignores everything bad, like the racial segregation of the military or internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II (even though it includes African-American Gabe Jones (Derek Luke) and Japanese-American Jim Morita (Kenneth Choi) among the Howling Commandos who join Captain America in his wartime escapades). But given the nature of this film, I don't fault it for praising America's achievements so highly, or for ignoring our misdeeds during WWII. Ironically (and unexpectedly), my only major criticism of the movie is that it ignores the misdeeds of our enemy.<br /><br />Captain America is defined as much by what he stands against as what he stands for. Joe Simon and Jack Kirby created him more than 70 years ago in response to the specific circumstances of their times. There's a reason they chose Adolf Hitler to be on the receiving end of their character's first blow for democracy on the 1941 cover of Captain America #1 (I was thrilled to see this [[ASIN:B00B9JCFKO iconic cover]] cleverly incorporated into the movie). The Third Reich and Nazi Party carried out evils unlike any the world had ever seen. As Jews, Simon and Kirby would have a very personal stake in showing Captain America symbolically destroy Hitler's forces in the pages of a comic book that at its height was selling a million copies a month. It would be inconceivable to make a movie about Captain America's earliest adventures, or any movie about World War II for that matter, without the Nazi's playing a prominent part. And yet, director Joe Johnston pulled it off--for reasons I can't begin to understand.<br /><br />The evil empire Johnston pits Captain America against is Hydra, a fictional terrorist network in the Marvel Comics universe. This is no doubt to set the organization up as a recurring adversary in future Marvel Studios films.  Here it's described as a Nazi research group that combined occult powers and advanced technology to create wonder weapons for Hitler's stormtroopers. What I found disturbing was that the Nazi part of the organization was downplayed to the point of virtual invisibility. Although Hydra's tentacled skull symbol got about as much screen time as the stars and stripes, I don't recall ever seeing a swastika (although I'm sure the few that must have appeared in the movie just went by so fast I missed them*). I might understand, at least theoretically, choosing to minimize references to Germany out of a sensitivity to present-day Germans (although, as Dr. Erskine points out in the film, \\"the first country the Nazi's invaded was their own\\"). But whose feelings could the filmmakers have been trying to spare by taking Nazis out of the picture? Even more incredible than the lack of swastikas in the movie, was the total absence of any mention of the Holocaust (as far as I can remember, it wasn't even hinted at). Besides being a seemingly misguided attempt to sanitize history, it also diminishes the importance of Captain America's conflict with the film's main villain.<br /><br />Hydra's leader is the Red Skull (played menacingly by Hugo Weaving), a character who debuted in the same 1941 comic book as Captain America and has been the arch nemesis of the \\"Sentinel of Liberty\\" ever since. The Red Skull is the living embodiment of everything Hitler and Nazi Germany stood for--Aryan superiority, racism, antisemitism, homophobia and blind obedience to the State to name a few. The Third Reich personified, he excels at and revels in the practical application of Nazi theory--unprovoked military aggression, torture, political repression and mass murder. But in the movie, the Red Skull abandons Nazism for a more vague, generic super villain desire to rule the world. The problem I have with this is that he never explains why this is his goal, or how a world under his control would differ from the one he's already living in. To put it in actor terms, I don't understand his motivation. It's clear that he is cruel and arrogant, which makes him Steve Roger's opposite in terms of his basic character. But in comic books, the Red Skull was created to be Captain America's opposite.<br /><br />Based on their depiction of Steve Rogers' pre-Captain America training, screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely were obviously influenced by [[ASIN:0871358115 The Adventures of Captain America: Sentinel of Liberty]],  a 1991 four-part miniseries by storytellers Fabian Nicieza and Kevin Maguire, retelling Cap's origin in commemoration of the character's 50th anniversary. Unfortunately, I get the impression Markus and McFeely never read the last book in the series, where a captured Captain America is taken to the heart of Nazi Germany and forced into an arena to battle the Red Skull in ritual combat before Adolf Hitler and an audience of Wehrmacht soldiers, Gestapo officers, and concentration camp prisoners (who were so conspicuously absent from the film). Of course, this intended demonstration of Aryan superiority does not turn out as Hitler had hoped. Now that's something I would have loved to have seen on the big screen.<br /><br />By removing any trace of Nazi philosophy from the Red Skull in this film, his final battle with Captain America becomes nothing more than two comic book characters slugging it out. Instead, it should have been an allegorical clash of ideologies: totalitarianism, intolerance and brutality versus freedom, acceptance and compassion. This is not just a war over territory but an epic war of wills that has been waged since the dawn of civilization--the Will to Power versus the Will of the People. For me, the failure to make clear the moral high ground in this fight kept a merely good movie from being truly great.<br /><br />* A case in point: In a movie poster for the film that recreated the cover of [[ASIN:B00B9JCFKO Captain America #1]], the swastika band that was originally on Hitler's right arm was moved to his left, thereby hiding the Nazi symbol from view.pers.

B00CATSONE|5.0|I never had even heard of Tesla until my teenager said \\" you have never heard of this guy?\\" I then had to know. This little book is well written and very interesting. I learned a lot of information and enough history to make it twice as interesting.
B003UBTX72|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Keith's autobiography.  It may be the best autobiography I've read.  Certainly the most fun.  Reading this short book is like being inside this unique man's head for a few hours. Definitely not a paint-by-the-numbers project.  Loaded with details about the creation of many Stones classics, and always upbeat and honest.  Put on some Stones and dig in.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is a good challenge, but not too hard that it forces you to give up! More rooms please :D
B001XV09UG|2.0|Loved cast and director. Thought it was all gratuitous nudity and not much plot. Kidman got to display her buff body, the end
159463176X|4.0|I have read all of Khaled Hosseini's books and liked all of them very much.  This book is a very good read, but like most of his books, it is a pretty sad story about Afganistan.  I feel the story is realistic and what happens in the book is typical of life of the people in Afghanistan, but it is a sad tale of life.  I'm glad I read the book and would read it again.  It has made me very aware of the plight of the ordinary people of Afghanistan.  It's worth the read.<br /><br />Sue Merz
B0090KZDSK|2.0|This was sold as a Trilogy.  Now I believe there will be another two books. This author is already riding on the back of fifty shades .  I was very dissapointed.  She reduced to the same style as fifty shades.  We did not want a repeat we wanted more adult reading.
0385341008|2.0|I simply couldn't get into the gist of the book, and never finished reading it.  I'm sure it's a good enough book for many people, but I simply coundn't get interested.  Sorry!<br /><br />Sue Merz
B00CFQN12Q|5.0|JUST AS I EXPECTED , ANOTHER GREAT BRUCE WILLIS MOVIE FOR THE RECORD, HE NEVER LETS YOU DOWN ON A GREAT MOVIE NO MATTER WHAT THE GENRE!!
B00006CXSS|5.0|The special effects were terrific. The interviews with the people that were actually there were very interesting and added a lot to the movie.
B00CDT41RY|1.0|WHAT A WASTE OF A PERFECTLY SPACE ON THE MOVIE LINEUP, THIS WAS TUFF TO WATCH OVER 2 MINUTES OF#%%!!
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Has all the components for a great movie; witty, action, romance and a bit of gore.. Great flick for both men and women.
B000I9U99K|5.0|RUSSEL HAS HAD A FEW FLICKS THAT DID NOT FIT WELL BUT THIS ONE IS GREAT, I HAD ALREADY OWNED IT AND LOANED IT OUT AND FORGOT WHO HAS IT(GREAT FRIENDS HUH) AND DECIDED TO REPURCHASE.
B00AYDC3CG|5.0|Another Tim Burton excellent movie! Great for all ages. We watched it via Amazon Prime on our wireless with no issues. Great Service.
B00CFOY244|3.0|YOU KIND OF KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT KIND OF MOVIE THAT IS HARD TO STAY WITH LONG
B00C391Y3I|5.0|This is a fine blu-ray to add to your heavy metal collection,if but for one caveat.....You gotta deal with Rob,who appears not to be in the best of voice for this show.Pitch errors are a more prominant issue in this show than on previous outings.Also, Rob sports a cane for a few segments ,perhaps baring evidence that the rumored recent back surgery was true after all.Mind you, the rest of the band more than make up for it with a punishing aural onslaught not unlike the best live Priest from the past. In particular, kudos go out to Richie Faulkner for stepping up to the plate to replace the now retired K.K.Downing on guitar,and then knocking it out of the park. Richie has a style of soloing that is very favorably compared to Zakk Wylde, and his spontaneous call-and-answer lead riffs with Priest vet Glenn Tipton are well composed and fitting with the Priest tradition.It should go without saying that the rock-solid rhythm section of drummer Scott Travis and bassist Ian Hill bring in yet another great freight-train of a performance,surging confidently through an over 2 hour set of metal classics.Faulkner's stage presence is spot-on as well,never trying to step on anyone's toes or hog the spotlight, even though the man definitely has the goods. He simply fits like an old comfortable shoe, and that's the way we should want it to go for our Rock heroes in the final chapter(maybe) of their long and storied career. No drama. Just accolades from an adoring public.
B000YMFCS4|5.0|THE KIND OF MOVIE YOU CAN WATCH OVER AND OVER(BUT NOT TO CLOSE TOGETHER)AND STILL CATCH SOMETHING YOU MISSED EARLIER,ALL IN ALL ITS A GREAT MOVIE!
B00637HXNG|5.0|I have to point out that I do not yet have a 3D TV,and, as such my review deals more with the performance of the band and the audio mix. I do have to say that it has a remarkably clear picture, and I can get a sense of what I've read from other reviewers regarding the advantageous close ups with various members of the group and how those scenes must really pop in 3D. Great choice of a setlist, not bogged down at all, and a good cross-section of old and new.VERY cool guitars,especially Rhythm guitarist Rudolph Schenker's automobile-themed guitars.Also very eye-catching were the Flying V and Explorer styled acoustic guitars played by Schenker and Lead Guitarist Mathias Jabs.<br />A very good punchy audio surround mix makes this show a keeper.It's a shame that these guys are about to hang it up, as they appear to have a lot of mileage left,but it's better to go out on top,I suppose. This event was an awesome way to document this epic band at the top of their game.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I wasnt disapointed at all. Worst part was the wait for it to come out. If you read the others you have to read.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good, but a bit easy, and too short really. Some descriptions on items would be nice too. Looking forward to more and harder levels though.
0132350882|4.0|As other reviewers this book certainly is worth reading, many of the tips covered on this book might be considered as common wisdom but its not.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to most programmers who are serious on writing maintainable code, there is really no need to know Java or Design patters to understand the examples, but definitely knowing those helps.<br /><br />The book itself its easy to read and provides insights on what to do when refactoring code, probably not for seasoned programmers, but still they might get surprised..
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Game was fun. I truely enjoy the puzzles and find the clue type games. My only complaint is that there are currently ten levels. I can't wait for more. Hopefully the makers will release them soon. I love the concept of combining clue parts to make them complete. The number/Color clues were an interesting obvious but easy to overlook right at first. Thank you for not making clutter scenes the way many hidden object games do.
B003RT0NK8|5.0|not many places can this movie be found,,,,looked everywhere and amazon only place where i found it. love amazon for all kinds of purchases
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|G5 keeps making gems. I love the horror underwater them for this game. Graphics are good and controls are great.
B002N57KG2|5.0|This movie came at the perfect time and was a great addition to my collection. I was very happy with everything!
B004JN1CW4|4.0|What's frightening is this could be a true story. They start a little slow, but picks up quickly. Enjoy the read.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|It could have expanded more of the mystery as to who did the murder & who murdered the Russian.  Just a little to much sex.  Sex is good but there's a limit
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This is a cute little game that my 6 year old absolutely loves and never gets bored of! We found it because my niece was over one day and playing it. She's 15 so its clearly enjoyed by children of any age.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Same as Entwined with you.  I could not wait for these books to come out.  It was okay.  I really thought it would be better reading.
B002CMXAYW|5.0|Is it me or does Nigel(the lead guitarist) look a lot like Jeff Beck?<br /><br />This is very good look at what it was like to be in a rock n' roll in the late 1970's and early 1980's, to tell the truth I'm very shocked that Spinal Tap would allow this film come out because it really doesn't show them in a good light. Well, their was no drugs and sex, from what I can remember, but still you question the intelligence. The costumes diffidently have not timed well and they should have hired some to write titles for the sound but then the music is fantastic.<br /><br />In the end this film as this guy that looks a lot like Jeff Beck (or is just me) and that you get to see the behind the scenes on how a successful rock n' roll band works and you get to cringe at bad costumes that really haven't timed well. Oh yeah, their is a little bit of footage of them on stage, I wish they showed more of the roadies so we could of gotten their story too) that showed \\"The Beatles\\" at their finest.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|I like this movie, but I &#34;love&#34; Carol Burnett and Tim Curry! When she sings &#34;Little Girls&#34; it is just fabulous! Tim Curry & Bernadette  Peters join her for &#34;Easy Street&#34; I am in heaven!
B001GJ5CHA|5.0|This is definitely the better version,  an actually enjoyable movie with several interweaving plots and some good lines.  Some awful lines too, but a lot of fun
B00D2K40WY|5.0|The grand daughters love it so that is all that needs to be said.  It keeps the attention of a 4 year old for hours.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Thought I liked the movie, then I didn't like the movie, then I realized it was a great movie and watched it again!
B00B9JDBSO|4.0|I'd have appreciated more pop concessions, so that noise philistines like me would have ways of identifying beyond the intellectual. The mistreated cello of \\"Fracking Fluid Injection\\" would make for great horror music in an eco-doc like \\"Gasland\\", only what place has it on my stereo? A narrative one, you could argue, in a sea of harsh, half-heard, half-understood statements about the modern world. None of which registers as more than theme. What does are the abrasive beats of \\"Full of Fire\\", the harmonic outliers of \\"Raging Lung\\", the joke of titling a mosquito freakout \\"Networking\\".
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|Great movie! Wasn't sure at first just from the preview and knowing it was about Jack and the Beanstalk, but love the movie.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Oh my!  The twists and turns to the story are marvelous.  Using the different perspectives makes the tale seem more complete.  It really highlights how easily &#34;facts&#34; can be misunderstood and twisted.
B003KRJNBW|5.0|Loved, loved, loved, loved, loved, loved, loved, and oh yeah....loved this movie! Have watched this movie a few times and would watch it again.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Season 1 seemed to set the stage and Season 2 is moving forward from that point.  The characters continue to evolve with the times.  I'm hooked!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show has shown me that there still are good writers and actors out there.  I was getting to the point where I did not even care to watch t.v. (not a bad place to be, but I love good stories) and then I stumbled across this series.  I watched the first season on Netflix, the second season on Hulu, and had to buy this season because I had to see what happens next.  Truly an excellent show.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|You know the movie, at this point, is a cult movie.<br />But the deal are the extras, a lot of extras, for a really low price. a must have.
B009GEYX5E|2.0|I purchased a PX680<br />because I need color<br />instead I recieved PX600 cool<br />This shouldn't've happened :/<br />I want what I ordered, color is more pleasant; not satisfied<br />that money could've been for 35mm film if I knew this was going to happen.<br />what a damn shame<br />Ok maybe I exaggerated a little,<br />Just disappointed it wasn't color when I opened the package :/
B002ZG981E|5.0|The movie is perfect, Period.<br />The edition, is the regular blu ray edition, but it comes with a bonus disk with really cool extras, 3 diferent and very interesting documentaries, trailers, stills, posters, etc.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Holy cow! I was definitely not expecting the ending I found for this 3rd installment of the adventures of Gideon and Eva. Their sexual appetite for one another is as strong as ever. That in no way is a spoiler if you've read the first two books. I have to admit that when those two got hot and heavy in the bedroom I skirted past that. I'm definitely excited for the next installment in their story because I want to know everyone's reaction to...<br /><br />Sorry but I can't tell without spoiling it for you. Grab it, read it but not before you read the first two books, Reflected in You and Bared to You.
B009JBZH54|4.0|If you just want to have the movies, this pack is ok, but if you want a great pack and some memorabilia just wait a couple of months for the ultimate edition.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Very addicting and fun. My son loves it and he is pretty good at it. we've purchased this game before.
B004EPYZUI|3.0|This is the kind of movies that no need your attention at all, just relax, sit in your favorite sofa and turn up the volumen, as loud as you can, just that.<br />the extras are not the big deal but there are fine. and the big deal is the price.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|All of the different perspectives were fun to absorb. Brooks writes the different characters so well. It's like several bedtime stories about the same story.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|The first two movies are simple perfects, the third one, is not so good but is the perfect ending to the trilogy.<br />But the deal with this pack is the greatest quality in the imagen and sound, PERFECT, so powerfull!<br />And the extras are amazing, hour and hours of extas, documentaries of the restoration, the making of the trilogy and a large etc,<br />If you don`t have it, buy it... no, really... BUY IT NOW!
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I use these lovely sounds for relaxing, meditating, cheering up and so many things.<br />Many times I play the sounds at work, while I do manicures. Very Nice.
B005LAIGOQ|3.0|The Woman In Black is a disappointing horror/mystery film mainly for reasons that surround the confusing storyline.<br /><br />Daniel Radcliffe of Harry Potter fame stars as a man who visits a castle out in the countryside for a few days.  The first thing that surprises me is how much older he's gotten.  Yes he's definitely reached the age appropriate to be a father now, rather shockingly.  Seems just like yesterday Sorcerer's Stone came out and I was enjoying it after high school graduation.<br /><br />Anyway the biggest problem is that, well a combination of two things- weak, overblown writing that makes the entire movie seem artificial and too Hollywood, and despite a solid 15 minutes of actual hauntings *finally* taking place 50 minutes into the movie, overall the Woman in Black just isn't scary or interesting enough.<br /><br />Perhaps Daniel himself starring in a movie like this is the Woman In Black's biggest downfall.  Most of us are familiar with the Harry Potter films and know what kind of magical creativity was used to make those films so rewarding and provide an unbelievable amount of eye candy using all the special effects you can imagine, but here... well, it's almost like it *tries* to recapture the same concept using horror elements but never succeeding in the same way so the movie ends up looking more like a weak imitation.  Also, a storyline that never really gets off the ground until it's too late pretty much holds down all the potential this movie could have had.<br /><br />Had to laugh when Harry walked into a room frightened and jumps when mud comes squirting out of a nearby bathtub.  Come on Harry, you just seen horrific otherworldly monsters- a little bit of mud during uneasy atmospheric conditions shouldn't hold YOU of all people back from proceeding!<br /><br />Oh, about those 15 minutes I mention above that is actually *good*.  This is when Harry, er, Daniel Radcliffe sees a rocking chair rocking by itself, apparitions walking down the hallways, apparitions roaming outside the castle, figures appearing in reflections and mirrors, shadows darting across the room, children lighting themselves on fire, toys making noises by themselves, etc.  This is REALLY excellent stuff however it all goes away due to the movie trying to tell a story involving the death of three children that jump out the window under mysterious circumstances.  I spent more time confused than I did satisfied.<br /><br />The Woman in Black is clearly more appropriate for Harry Potter fans instead of horror lovers.  With that said, it's not bad by any means.  Basically the first half is disappointing and the second half improves in the atmosphere and horror categories, but fails in the storyline for the most part.  I like the ending involving a fast moving train, though.  I know what you're thinking- no, Daniel does *not* fly a car into the world of wizardry with Ron Weasley. :)
B005K17RU0|5.0|So far so good. It is doing exactly what I want it to do. It was able to find my locations that I entered with no problem. This is a keeper.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Omg this game is awesome can't wait until my next dragon hatches! I get to put it in my gemstone island GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Why couldn't there have been a little video of something anything! At the end? To me I feel it would have made the game polished and a sense of accomplishment pretty disappointed I must say. Other than that bravo what a nice game visually and mentally on the kindle.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Awesome free app, can't go wrong.  Simple to set up and operate.  It also gives you a lot of options tinker for your own network.  Great for network attached files.  Better than the wd my book live to use.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|IT's good time! Plus with the super easy controls even the kiddies can have  fun!! 20 word minimum so hears some filler! It's fun  and free! Try it out!
B003L77FYS|5.0|LV this program great CD to catch up on missed episodes. Relaxing when I need it and can't say enough
B00B7Y0206|3.0|For the first few times, it worked perfectly.  However, now it will not load any categories.  Also if you know how to sign into youtube on it, please let me know.  For me it just says copy this and change your application.  If you know how to, please leave me an email at 123maxperry@gmail.com.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Ranger Bob needs a neck brace, roll bar, or driving lessons. Great game, I love that  bone crunching sound when Ranger Bob flips over!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I found this game very addicting and gave me a challenge. It made me use my brain to figure out stumping problems. I would recommend to just about anyone. Try it
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Fun and easy the kids like the game.not quite sure how to end the game feels like it goes on forever.not even sure if the game has an ending...but lots of fun anyway.

B008ZDC7M8|3.0|As a filmmaker and student of film my interest in this collection was guided by customer reviews here. In fact, I stumbled into it while looking for an old film-history book I can't find anywhere, \\"Behind the Silver Screen,\\" which was my first film textbook (together with \\"Film as Art\\") in the '60s. I was very impressed with Mr. Cousins' ability to hop from one cultural context to another and bring the origins of one film to another into its impact on subsequent generations of film-making. The survey is amazingly comprehensive.<br /><br />I was, however, turned off from the beginning when Mr. Cousins started his editorializing, trying to pass his opinion as historical fact on the value of one type of film-making over another. To assert that Japanese film is classic while Hollywood film is not at the beginning of the series made me weary of what was to come: not exactly a balanced account.<br /><br />Some inaccuracies made me cringe. For example, when Mr. Cousins in Disc 2 refers to \\"Dona Barbara\\" (1943), directed by Fernando de Fuentes, he states that it was a representation of the Mexican woman as victimized. The film is actually set in Venezuela, in spite of its Mexican production, cast and crew. It was based on a novel by Venezuelan writer R&oacute;mulo Gallegos, the finest example of the persistent literary theme of civilization v. barbarism in South America, not a glorification or exultation of Mexican women. These details make his comments less trustworthy as the series progresses: it's always the danger of evaluating cultural aspects of art when such values are alien to the evaluator.<br /><br />While I would recommend the collection to anyone interested in a visual encyclopedia on film, I warn the viewer of Mr. Cousins insufferably dull delivery as he narrates. It is uninspired and never changes inflection, which is the perfect combination for inducing sleep. I fell asleep so many times I had to keep going back to see what I had missed while I dozed off.<br/>  (AN ADDITION TO MY INITIAL REVIEW:)<br /> When I first wrote a review for this product I had not yet watched the last two discs in the set. Nothing in these two invalidates my previous comments. However, they do add to my uneasiness about the content and format of the set.<br /> I was looking for a survey of film history. What I found is a very subjective and hperbolic defense of little known film productions. Good film does not need someone to state that it is \\"the best ever in film history\\" or \\"the most beautiful,\\" \\"the most &lt;everything>,\\" as it stands on its own merits. Picking Gus van Sant as representative of American film trends in the '90s unsettled me, particularly because it was not van Sant's earlier work, such as \\"Mala noche,\\" that Mr. Cousins focuses on, but rather \\"My Own Private Idaho\\" and the orgasm scene.<br /> Mr. Cousins' biases are so obtrusive that they cloud the history of film as it developed in France, Hollywood or anywhere else. Covering the innovativeness of African film, Mr. Cousins presents \\"Hyenas\\" (1992), directed by Djibril Diop Mamb&eacute;ty. His interpretation is that Mambety presented modern consumerism and capitalism in a condemnatory way. While that may be true, the story was based on \\"The Visit,\\" by Swiss playwright Friedrich D&uuml;rrenmatt, whose focus was greed and vengeance. \\"The Visit\\" was filmed in 1964 with Ingrid Bergman and Ahtony Quinn. Mr. Cousins missed the opportunity to provide his viewers a greater service by contrasting the original ending of the story with Mambety's version instead of presenting the latter's film as representative of African film-making.<br /> His take on an uninterrupted crane sequence in \\"Battle in Heaven,\\" a commercial flop but an outstanding metaphor of contemporary Mexican society, is that it is meant to represent Mexican social disparity. He should have included Carlos Reygadas in one of his interviews and had Carlos explain this instead of asserting what the sequence is meant to convey: isolation, disconnectedness other than sexual among human beings, our incapacity to alter the world outside of us. It is a film about existential despair where social inequality is an aspect, not the focus. I remit the reader to my earlier comment on Mr. Cousins' lack of cultural understanding of the films he presents and his nonetheless free-handed comments about sociocultural issues.<br /> Some of Mr. Cousin's valuation of film technique either requires a superhuman sensibility to detect or a great ability for exaggeration and nonsense; after watching the entire series I was convinced the latter was more likely. Mr. Cousins strove to present something out of the ordinary and ended up presenting the weird as exceptionally  representative. The series should have been more aptly titled \\"A Story of Marginal Film with Connections to Mainstream Movies.\\" His entire monologue, relentlessly uninspired, is occasionally broken up by interviews with off-Hollywood filmmakers. That is very interesting indeed, but none of the interviews actually add anything to our understanding of film in general. Van Sant's interview is particularly silly.<br /> The DVDs have technical problems. In some spots the video and the audio go completely dark; in others it breaks up as if it had been copied from VHS tape. The menus do not work right. Other than the \\"Play All\\" button none other seems to work. The left arrow takes the viewer to unexpected places, and although there is a \\"Bonus\\" section indicated on all discs, nothing really takes you there.<br /> I will never watch this again.
B00992CF6W|5.0|can't. Find out how to update but it's a great game  it's great for kids and parents<br />my son loves it he's always playing with his friends
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun game, hard to stop playing once you get the hang of it.  Keeps the mind sharp.  I would recommend it to anyone.
B0063M22QO|4.0|This version is great for me. The colors are bright and I can actually see the tiles! I am enjoying it maybe too much.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|If you liked ID4, you'll love this.  Great action, aliens and the military.  A recipe for awesomeness.  Not really based on the boardgame in case you were wondering.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|An extremely well done documentary.  Our son recommended it and I absolutely endorse his recommendation.  It is well deserving of the praise that it has received.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game I have it for the Pc but every time I try to download the app it says that there was an error while downloading can someone please help me out
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This is a fun game. I really like that there are lots of ways to get the pearls where you don't have to spend real money. My daughter loves Nemo so this game is perfect.
0743297334|5.0|Read it. Actually read it. I will bet you anything it's been assigned to you and you're thinking that you'll skip it, but just read it. Get through all of it, whether you hate it or love it. If you love it, bully for you. If you hate it, it'll get stuck in your head the rest of your life anyway. Hemingway is just that annoyingly good.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I have not reviewed many books in my life. This book is a good read that believe any sci-fy fan will enjoy. It kept me awake reading many nights. I felt every loss personally. It made me angry, but I kept on reading. I hope that there will be more silo stories in the future.<br /><br />Update, I see that there is another series about silo called \\"Shift\\". This will be my next purchase.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game.  It reminds me of the PC game Myst only a much smaller version.  The challenges are fun.
0763644765|5.0|this book is simple but very cute.  i like how the child in the story is independently working to become potty trained, but that his family appears in the end to celebrate -- very motivational.  because we have a dog and cat in the house i loved that it shows how they &#34;use the potty&#34; too.  my son grins at the illustrations.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|lord of catan! the game can be a bit tricky to learn, but once you get going it comes naturally. the original game can be a bit boring because essentially all you do is collect resources and build. but with all the different combinations of the map and the strategy of building, it gets really interesting each game. oh yeah, you will learn to hate the robber baron.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|I have read all of Albom's books and have to say that the Time Keeper is okay; not the best of his pieces. Time Keeper is an interesting read and the story line is great, however I didn't find myself as fascinated and encaptured in the novel as with his prior works, such as the Five People You Meet in Heaven or Tuesdays with Morrie. I had no difficulty putting down the book and resuming where I left off weeks at a time. I still love his pieces though. He remains one of my all time favorite authors.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I lovel this app!  I share it with everyone I know with a Kindle.  It is like Mahjong squared!  It might even be good for training your brain.
B003Y6EL5W|4.0|Great flick with surprising ending, maybe.  Know that superheroes are out of the box, when will the sequel come out.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is Awesome. A bit mind bending but its creativity makes the game addictive and fun to play. I had negative thoughts about this  game at first. Thinking it was a lame no brainer kind of game. But it isn't I enjoy playing it.
0307913147|5.0|Loved this book.  Great read.  Couldn't put it down or stop listening to it. Had to buy paperback also.  Wil Wheaton does a great job.
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|That was one of the most terrible movies I have seen in a long time. The special affects made Flash Gordon look like an Oscar. James Franco needs to stick to making spider-man movies and Mila Kunis should never ever attempt to play anything evil. She is way too valley girl. She actually pissed me off by how stupid she looked in that ridiculous witch costume. Sam Raimi needs to slap himself for directing this movie. Obviously someone at Disney was touched by the good idea fairy and decided that this would be a good movie to make...that person needs to be kicked in the ball sack.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|awesome game.. keeps me entertained when I'm bored. I like it and how the levels increase in difficulty. I don't like how it makes you rate it though to continue the game..
B009D0LBRO|5.0|This game is a thing of wonder. All developers who strive to make quality games for tablets should vigorously study \\"Rayman Jungle Run\\", because this is how it should be done. Ubisoft has pulled off a fantastic trick, creating the perfect complement to their wonderful \\"Rayman Origins\\" game on consoles and PC. The trick isn't that they made the game so good, it's that they made it so good on TABLETS.<br /><br />Platformers are widely regarded as a lost cause with touch interface, but Ubisoft has miraculously made it work, and it works fantastic. The response time is super tight, retaining that wonderful Rayman \\"feel\\" from its console big brother. Additionally, this game shares the beautiful visuals and feel-good soundtrack of \\"Rayman Origins\\". The artwork is breathtaking, and the animations fluid. It looked incredible on consoles, but seeing it look equally good on my Kindle Fire HD almost seems too good to be true. The Kindle is generally known for being relatively underpowered, as far as Android tablets go, but Ubisoft optimzed this game perfectly for the little guy. It runs smooth, and it's fun, fun, fun. And as you pilot your legless, armless protagonist through the strange worlds, the catchy tunes will have you bopping your head and smiling!<br /><br />The levels are just the right length, and each one can be completed in well under a minute. But it's not so much about completing the levels... it's about the infectious drive to perfect them. This game is so much fun to play, and so wonderfully drawn, you can't help but return to the levels, striving to attain 100% completion by collecting all lumbens as you blissfully sprint, leap, and bop your way to the finish line. And there are plenty of levels to be found, with each group of them introducing a new skill to master. This is a fantastic value at $2.99. Fortunately, I was able to pick it up for free by spending 299 of the 500 free coins that Amazon gave Kindle owners, but I would have been glad to pay for it.<br /><br />This would be a great platformer on any system. The fact that it runs on a Kindle is simply astounding. The bar has been raised for tablet developers, and raised quite significantly. Well done, Ubisoft!r /><br />This would be a great platformer on any system. The fact that it runs on a Kindle is simply astounding.

B00B2V66VS|1.0|I hats temple run 2 it never loads on my kindle fire. 95% of the time it will get half way loaded and then go back to my home screen. Save your time and don't get this app.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|Hilarious for anyone 30 and over that is married and has kids... I just couldn't stop laughing! The movie is just too easy to relate to so you can't help but crack up!
B000OLROWC|5.0|Hadn't seen this since my original viewing as a child, the year it came out. It's a sweet story and held up well, despite some great 80s cheesy parts.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|Well worth the price. Great game with lots of replay value. Nice to have a FF game I can play anywhere on my Kindle Fire HD
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I am disabled now and cannot go camping like I used to. Setting this app<br />in just the right way makes me feel like I am back in the woods:)
B0044XV3QY|5.0|I have seen Avatar on blu-ray before, it had been a long time and the one I owned wasn't blu-ray.  All I can say is this movie was MADE to be a blu-ray, the experience is so incredible.  And the extras are so worth it!  I watched to disc that expanded on the making of the movie, and if you don't mind the fact that some of what you will be watching will be &#34;in production&#34;, meaning it is not the finished product, it does so much to expand and explain more of the whole story.  It answered questions I had about the finished product and told so much about the characters.  Buy it!!!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved this book hoping for a fourth one. I loved all three of them they are great books. Thanks
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The Subway Surfers is well designed and it changes the missions, setting, and the things you can get which prevents me from boredom. Another thing that pulled me in was the price FREE. It deserves 5 stars. :-)
B008NEMN0K|3.0|Yet another movie that is lacking in the 3d effects area.I know the technology is still fairly young but if they are going to continue to charge an arm and a leg for the 3d version of a movie I think the effects should be a lot better.At the very least not forcing me to constantly check the 3d settings to see if they are set right!!!
B00A6RVRXG|3.0|I've gotten used to Yo La Tengo switching between genres in music, playing folksy tunes, going into 10-plus minute jam sessions, exploring noise... This album is possibly the most cohesive product of Yo La Tengo, with jams that feel more like Loose Fur playing &#34;Laminated Cat&#34; amidst the folk songs and pleasant rock songs. It is undeniably a Yo La Tengo album and it's good to see them still breaking their mold after close to 30 years.
B002VRZEYM|4.0|Be prepared to look at your food sources differently after watching this. I have suggested this to many friends and family members.
B00A2FSXHK|1.0|This film is essentially a future Indiana Jones. Same worn out tropes, lame family comedy and disjunctive musical effects. It is Spielberg self parody.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|if they put in more time to use better things to mane the clients happy like changing characters for boys and girls and better action packed features it could have 5 stars
1439163154|5.0|James Franco the actor somewhat transferred to James Franco the author in this book.<br />Fun, unexpected and sexy as he explores Palo Alto youth and their &#34;extra curricular&#34; activities out of home and school.<br />This book certainly caught me by surprise.<br />It was a jog back memory lane from my high school days, as I was a misfit myself.<br />I read it in one day and that tells you that I didn't put it down, definitely a page turner.<br /><br />Bottom line is, I enjoyed it. Buy it, laugh and pass it along :)
B003O86FMW|5.0|Awesome book!  Won't forget Suzanne Collins epic writing skills. Can't believe this book was written by someone, it's so good, and I couldn't put it down!
B00BIR381W|5.0|As usual the third season is awesome. If you haven't seen the third season its a must. It just keeps getting better and better!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Sad, frightening, and happy. The things you should look for in a good book. I would recommend it to anyone. I loved this book!
B0090KZDSK|5.0|loved, loved, loved it, it is so great reading about Gideon & eva & their amazing love for each other, their complicated lives & the journey they are going on, cant wait for the next instalment?????
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This game is expensive but worth it the game lets you go where ever you want to go instead of following a story line and a great game for somebody who loves action
B00AREIAI8|5.0|You have a fun interactive game here. Of course, you do have timed actions like riding lessons for money, but you always have something else to do, this game always keeps you busy. It always keeps you having fun.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|When I play this game it Reminds me of my childhood. Oregon trail was the first game see had on our computer growing up.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|Awsome game lots of fun glad it's on kindle now, hope they make more games from I pad to the kindle fire
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I finished it week ago and two of my friends have already purchased it. It brings a new comfort zone to life after death.
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|This app will impress you..... I'm playing it over again .  That's a first... you won't be disappointed. It takes about 1700 mbps.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really love this game...gets the mind working overtime!However sometimes I get stumped and have to ask my 16 year old for help. But I'm old..so that's my excuse!  Definately download this if you like puzzles.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|My 9 year old son accidently destroyed the usb cable that came with our Kindle Fire HD.  I bought a replacement one at a local office supply store.  Even though it fit the Kindle and I also had the Amazon piece that plugs into the wall and that the cable plugs into, it did not work the same as the original cable that came w/ the Kindle Fire HD.  It would not charge while it was powered on and it took hours to charge it.  I came across this cable from Amazon, ordered it, and am very happy and so are my children:). It works just like the original one.  You can use it while it is charging and I am very happy with it.  It really makes a big difference.  I am not sure why it is superior to other Micro-USB Cables that you can purchase elsewhere that look the same but it is.
B00992CF6W|5.0|BEST GAME EVER me and my brother are sooooooo happy with the update I really recomend this game with cake eggs spawners and buckets
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|It was good but not great.  I hated the ending!  It was was to abrupt and did not offer any hint of the future.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Wonderful book to read, whether you are a runner or not. Rather life changing for a person like me, just getting into running.  Very informative, wonderfully written.
B002H1J2AO|5.0|This is a good movie to go back in time and watch it every few years. The quality on TV was excellent.
B002GSXKN8|3.0|The DVDs were delivered as advertised and in great condition. A bit annoyed though that I bought the set for $29 and the following week I saw the exact same set at Walmart for $9.95.
006097625X|5.0|I keep meaning to read this. For some reason I start it and don't manage to finish it So I bought it to finish it someday.
B00932A4XE|4.0|not the book but cute. I love watching women try to simulate giving birth when they've never done it. You either know it or you don't. There's no method acting your way through it if you haven't done it.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Loved it. I loved that there was always help when I got stuck. It was well worth the cost. Thanks
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have only one word ADDICTIVE, can't stay away, just one more game,just one more game. I really love this game.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Easy to play, even without internet connection. best game when you want to relax and not think. Timer seconds are slower than actual seconds.
B001QWBM62|4.0|I bought this device to do a video shoot.  I used the two on-board mics + two external sennheiser e935's. The sound quality was acceptable on the two individual stereo tracks, but when I used the machine to mix the 4 tracks down to 2, I picked up a very noticable mid-volume level ticking (as noted by another reviewer).  While this doesn't kill the machine's utility since I could use post processing (Audacity software) to perform the mix, it really is a bummer to have such a noticeable flaw in a brand new device.
B00ADW4I9O|5.0|Why are you reading this? GO BUY THE MUSIC! What? You're still reading? Are you afraid to believe that this is really IT, that this is really the music you've been waiting for for ... twenty, thirty years? Well, it IS the music you've been waiting for! By Crom, stop wasting precious time: buy, BUY NOW!<br /><br />Okay, seriously, I'm not sure I can add much to what everyone else has written. Read some of the other reviews, 'cause I'm only going to write about what hasn't yet been mentioned (to my knowledge).<br /><br />First, the remastering is great. We've never heard the music like this, at least not on CD. And--Crom be praised!--the remastering is NOT blown-out and compressed to hell. It's perfect, unlike, say, the remastered \\"Special Edition\\" Star Wars soundtracks, which are blown to hell and have lost much of their dynamism. So kudos to the producers. They've lovingly retouched a masterpiece. You'll hear instrument and vocal parts with clarity and presence you've probably never heard before.<br /><br />Second, yes, you will hear outtakes and alternate tracks that aren't in the movie. The alternate/original \\"Anvil of Crom,\\" for example, is almost identical to the Nic Raine version but quite different from the movie version. At least one track--\\"Capture\\"--I don't think is featured even on the Raine re-recording. So again, yes, this collection is as complete as I can imagine (without sitting down and playing the soundtrack CDs and movie DVD side-by-side).<br /><br />Now I will discuss the one and only \\"con.\\"<br /><br />Although this CD set is likely the crown jewel (or Eye of the Serpent) of my music collection, the recording quality does not compare favorably with the Raine version. I can't fault anyone for that, of course: I can't expect 1982 recording tech to compete with 2010 technology. But the result is, still, slightly disappointing. When I'm in the mood to listen to the \\"Conan\\" score, I will therefore likely be playing the Poledouris and Raine recordings together on shuffle or, perhaps, back-to-back. It's like having different but equally beautiful versions of a symphony: one being an old but intensely performed version, while the other is new and better recorded--but not performed as ferociously.<br /><br />Let me be clear, though: whatever the merits of the Raine re-recording (and there are many), the original is incomparable. This soundtrack IS everything we've imagined it might be--and more. Yes, more. And yes, I know: we can all imagine quite a bit. Indeed. But Poledouris's imagination--and the skill of those who've resurrected this masterpiece--surpasses the imagination.<br /><br />Enjoy, my Hyborian brethren. Our wait is over.
B000Z0OX9O|5.0|Having bought the CD released after the Director's Cut - this version adds a bunch of extra material used throughout the movie (and collected from other Vangelis bootlegs/releases). Tracks like Tyrell's death (as a rather moving piece of audio), which were not available in 1994 are great to have in this more definitive cut.
B00BGIBVP8|2.0|The trailers were better then the movie. I watched it with my husband who is 45 thinking we would get a lot of laughs out of it. We were both disappointed. It was more crude and off-putting than I thought necessary,  and it was humorous only in bits. They could have edited half the movie out and it would have been better. The acting was fair and the characters were pretty good, but it missed on the funny and a story line. In the end I wasn't sure what to think I had just seen. Hmm.Hmm
B005SJIP1E|5.0|Bernstein manages to live in Mahler's mind with his renditions.  He is not afraid of taking the time necessary to bring out the passion behind the music.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Simply awesome. I love puzzles and this app gives me a variety to choose from as well as giving me the option of changing how many pieces I want to work with. The music playing in background is also very soothing. This is a great way to ease your mind and have fun at the same time.
1416585710|2.0|Not at all what I expected from a Stephen King novel.  Did not find it very entertaining nor did it EVER reach out an grab me like his books normally do. I couldn't even get it finished...too much like a textbook.
B00190OHD6|4.0|this movie starts out a bit slow, but don't give up on it!  About 20 minutes, or so, into it, it becomes a good movie with bits of comedy and enough drama to have you keep your Kleenexes close by.  I would recommend this movie.
B001BC5HXG|5.0|One of the most poignant books I've read. Steinbeck gives great insight into human nature and our inner thoughts. This book will stay with me for years.
B005DJREJS|5.0|I'm way to old to be watching this show, but I love it! It's funny and heartbreaking, give it a try.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book could Truly change the world!!! So simple, it's crazy! You think you know how to love, until you've read this book!! Very thankful for it's existence. I'm a new Man. My wife is going to love it! Thank you Doctor Chapman!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game to play everyday I play this  game if I'm bored  lol so fun for me
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This film's well-told wonderful story includes several stunningly beautiful scenes as a couple of strange companions, a teenage boy and a wild tiger, drift in a lifeboat across the Pacific Ocean.  The story maintains a modicum of what is believable by not losing sight of the fact that the tiger is a wild animal.  What Pi and the rest of the audience wish to happen, never quite transpires, which offers a good lesson about real life.  The acting, the script, and the filming are exceptional.  I highly recommend this film for older children through adults.
B008Y73XTQ|5.0|Since the video is all in German I didn't think I'd like it however, I found that as I got into the movie it was great, I have watched it twice and enjoyed it each time.  I think the producer did a good job with a tough subject.  It's worth the watch.;
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app it tops temple run you can earn so many different characters when you go to different places like Paris!!!!!:)
B0018QPPXW|5.0|You better believe it was Risky! Awesome one night business venture! Lots of Pimps got irritated from this film!! LOL
0525953728|5.0|Easy read.  A real page turner.  Glad he came forward and wrote the book for the everyday Joe.  Delivery was timely to Afghanistan.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|One never knows what to think when reviews are all over the map about a film. I was delighted to find an intricate set of six stories woven together so that the story lines flowed coherently. It takes incredible skill to have pulled off the ambition that Cloud Atlas represents.<br /><br />Cloud Atlas is thoroughly entertaining throughout, in drama, adventure, with comedy bits sprinkled in.<br /><br />This is a movie that merits repeated viewing, as there are so many details in this rich tapestry. The repeated, rather astonishing logical interlocking of sequential segments in the storytelling can only begin to be appreciated upon a second viewing.<br /><br />We watched with captions on the first time, which is practically a necessity to catch all the dialogue, though most of it is clear enough.<br /><br />While ultimately this is a message film, that reveals itself overtly only in the end, and wraps up the movie intelligently.<br /><br />This movie requires close attention. Reviews that complain about the film being boring, or not being able to follow the film, are by people who need to stick to short-attention-span theater (bang-bang action and pratfall humor).<br /><br />Having watched the film six times now, it has become easy to appreciate that Cloud Atlas is the greatest movie ever made, in effortless storytelling of a complexity never attempted in film before, and in effectively conveying a life-affirming philosophy while being an action/adventure film of the highest magnitude.<br /><br />If you are interested in film as culture as well as entertainment, this is a rewarding must-see.
B0002KPIQY|1.0|I remembered this movie when  i was young, but it definitely didn't age well with the times, this time around it was horrible.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game and many others were installed for my Great Grandchildren. Everytime they come for a visit they find a new game to play. I do not mind because the games are free and the children are kept busy and they enjoy there visit. They call me the Cool Grammy and I love it.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Got this for my son, we love the movie, but love the minions even more! We can watch it every day and not get tire of it!
B0089LOG02|5.0|One of the best books I've read in years..<br />Started it Tuesday finished it in two days.<br />It makes me want learn more about the subject matter.<br />Would highly recommend reading.
B00000K2W1|5.0|Janis Joplin's best raspy-voiced songs are collected into one album. If anyone likes quality raspiness in a voice, her's is the one to listen to. One can never tire of listening to her passionate, rejuvenating, spunky voice. She is a true rocker of all times and it's no wonder people are still trying to imitate her style but just can't seem to do it like the original one and only.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I truly enjoyed Eva and Gideon's story! Glad there love story will continue, I just wished we would have known this before so I wouldn't read the book in two days
B00004Z4SD|4.0|THE STRAIGHT STORY, the play on words title from the unconventional David Lynch distributed by Walt Disney Pictures, is about a side of America rarely seen in movies but one we see -- if we're lucky -- in our own neighborhoods and towns every day. In a way, it's the quintessential pre-9/11 movie about American humanity.<br /><br />Lynch, who also created the sound design, teams with Freddie Francis (cinematographer) and Mary Sweeney (co-producer, co-writer and editor) on evoking Alvin Straight's (Richard Farnsworth) Odyssean journey of 300 miles to see his dying brother (Harry Dean Stanton). There's double meaning in the title -- named after the main character but also Lynch playing it straight as director -- which is a welcome to viewers seeing THE STRAIGHT STORY for the first time. There's a pleasure in being as honest and stubborn as the character and both Richard Farnsworth and the film itself are no-nonsense folk. You're almost waiting for this Hollywood gang filming in Wisconsin and Iowa to poke fun at the characters and the story, to turn it into a three-act genre story, especially with Disney looming over the proceedings.<br /><br />But what you have are just honest to goodness quality performances that are real, including Sissy Spacek as the autistic daughter Rose. The people Alvin encounters along the way seemed to be plucked right from the farmhouses and villages he passes. It's a hero's journey and I'm very glad I finally sat down to watch it fourteen years after its release.<br /><br />Interesting note from Lynch himself on the inside cover of the DVD that he doesn't believe chapters should be used for films -- it's not a book, he says. Therefore, THE STRAIGHT STORY is one continuous whole. Alvin didn't want to cut corners on his trip, and neither does Lynch.
B00D6BQG1W|2.0|The previews show all the highlights. There were not many more funny or action scenes other than those shown in the previews.
B0011Z31V8|5.0|This album truly includes the best of prince's songs!  So happy i decided to download it, and definitely recommend it for others!
0887431453|5.0|this is perfect my daughter who is looking for summer educational ideas to keep children occupied.  The perfect gift for all three of them.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|I love western movies. This movie met my expectations of a more realistic western.So many westerns are are produced with an unreal story line. .
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|For those in search of answers, reviews and general opinion of the 'Blu-Ray' . . .<br />YES, it is worth the purchase price.<br />I've been on this planet 50 years and Star Trek TOS never looked and sounded this good.<br />The picture detail and color correction alone make this a worthwhile purchase.<br />Go for it! You won't be sorry.
B000I9YLUI|5.0|It is a classic! Exemplifies romance and love! If you love old time movies and romance this is your movie.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Great story--very captivating and hard to put down!  Please read in order to get the flow.  I would recommend for sure.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Me and my  child finshed all the levels together. She said that she wanted the game on her tablet. So you guys made a wonderful game.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|Good for all ages--upper elementary age and up. Liked that it was in the boy's voice and all the others.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Omg this is my 6th time reading them and I still cry at some points particularly Gales whipping and when Katniss finds out Peeta is in the Capital
1781162646|5.0|This was one of the most enjoyable reads I have had in a long time. The characters were well defined and believable. I could actually picture the persons in my mind.
B009NY43NY|3.0|So she got my money...I'm a sucker.  I didn't hate it, I didn't love it.  Basically, I felt nothing.  This book took the longest to read for me because (as many of us have) I just stopped caring.  I am glad I finished out the series though even if I could care less what happened to all the characters I once loved.
1781162646|4.0|I enjoyed this. It was more of a suspense, crime drama, but Mr. King's hand was still apparent. I would have given it five stars if not for (always, always, always) &#34;special&#34; kid with &#34;helpful&#34; powers. I loved the carney parts and learned about old amusement parks. Though not SK's standard fare, it is defiantly worth the read.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|This app is really cool and fun. I'm just a klutz so I messed up a few times. I love it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway suffers is so much fun! Wither you are young or old, subway suffers is very fun. This game is addictive once you start,and will continue to be. This game has no flaws,and is perfect. I would recommend this game to people who have lots of time on their hands!
B009EJSUBY|5.0|This is a great addition to my collection.  I got to attend a concert featuring Van Cliburn back in about 1959.  What an experience.  Mr. Cliburn was just terrific.  I know that he was not happy with the conductor during the concert,  but he was just great, so I'm very happy with this complete album.
B0079XPUOW|3.0|This is quite clearly a parody of Star Trek, zeroing in on the plight of the hapless redshirts that seem to die on every away mission while the main heroes always escape unscathed. The book takes this premise seriously as the redshirts start to realize they're marked for death, and their unraveling of what they perceive to be a real mystery is pretty cool stuff. It's when the book turns to some super-meta &#34;show within a show&#34; weirdness that the plot falls apart for me, as author John Scalzi took the novel precisely where I hoped he wouldn't go. There's still some great dialogue and characters here, but the final third of the book turned this from &#34;marvelous&#34; to &#34;meh&#34; for me.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This game is absolutely amazing! It has the suspense and mystery that keeps you hooked to the game till the end. Definitely worth playing :)
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|What's to say about this tremendous story that hasn't already been said? Arthur C. Clarke delivers one of the gems of science fiction with sweeping questions about the future of humanity and our place in the universe with the coming of the seemingly benevolent Overlords. If you haven't read this yet, quit reading this review and get on it, already!
B008S4YZCO|5.0|awesome creation of the paper creatures. could have put more thought into the story line but in a overall it a great game.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a well made game. It is a lot of fun, relaxing, challenging, and beautiful. I'm really glad they keep making more of these games.
B00DBSZEH2|1.0|It's like Army of Darkness without the comedy.  I love Army of Darkness because it's funny...not so with this one.
B00BR0SGN0|5.0|DP has been revitalized again with this bold, satisfying outing. The songs are sinewy, smart compositions that benefit enormously from Bob Ezrin's (Kiss, Pink Floyd. Alice Cooper, Kansas ) production. Finally, Steve Morse can throw off all comparisons to Ritchie Blackmore, now gone for 20 years. He owns his role in the band with gusto, But the real star here is keyboardist Don Airey. Airey's clever arrangements show his confidence and flair. While Ian Gillan doesn't have the durability in his upper range that he used to, the vocalist hardly needs it here. His tone is still strong at age 67, and his ability to compete with Airey and Morse remains undiminished. If you like Deep Purple, I can't imagine you not really enjoying &#34;Now What ?!&#34;
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I watched this with my little nieces they loved it and i was even drawn into the movie. It is exciting and funny for all ages

B005DOKIYG|5.0|I really like this case. No frills protection for my Kindle Fire. The handle gives me a sense of security for grip. It fits in my purse very nicely.
B00CATSONE|4.0|I liked this book, it was a great look into the psyche of a genius and what makes a genius.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is so addicting because you can't wait to compete against others and win money and stuff. My only complaint is that it's very hard to earn gems, and lots of the cool stuff requires gems.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game and I love horses.  I play this game all the time but I wish it was easier to get diamonds.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This is one of the best game I have played in FOREVER!! If u are a fan of winning achievements, ranking up, non-stop action and more...

I am not putting out a price that is ninja kiwis job.<br /><br />Please take this into consideration!<br /><br />Chris Roselli :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game it's so fun it's worth of downloading it's such a great game if your not sure to get it and you look at the reviews well you should totally get this game

B007V65R54|5.0|Nate Silver dissects the world of prediction and forecasting with his own bias at the fore. Since that bias happens to Bayesian theory (whose first step in the method is to set out one's preconceptions and biases on a topic set out for prediction), this is appropriate.<br /><br />The Big Surprise for me was that I found myself appreciating the analytical grounding of Donald Rumsfeld—who was the very public face of an administration and a war I abhorred. Silver breaks out the phrase that was so maligned by Rumsfeld's critics as an example of his opaque, last-century thinking and reveals its brilliance in context. The &#34;unknown unknown&#34; is part of a matrix: what we know we know, what we know we don't know, what we don't know we know, and what we don't know that we don't know. Silver demonstrates how the last case, &#34;don't know/don't know,&#34; was an underlying factor for the intelligence failures leading up to the 9/11 attacks. Since no one in the intelligence community or elsewhere could imagine that human beings would intentionally hijack an airliner with the intention of using it in a suicide attack (they &#34;didn't know that they didn't know this&#34;), attackers could therefore exploit openings in a security system that was looking for hijackers who wanted to survive.<br /><br />The incessant and well-deserved jabs at media political analysts are amusing and revelatory. The traditional n<br /><br />Sometimes Silver goes on a bit too long analyzing each of his example cases, but each discussion builds on the last and the reader is left with an appreciation for how difficult forecasting and prediction truly are.
B005LAIHSQ|1.0|There are so many reasons not to buy the Blu-Ray copy of this movie.  The movie itself has been thrashed to pieces by other reviewers, so I won't bother to add to that.<br />I remember watching this disc when I first bought it and don't remember having any problems with it.  This month my granddaughter was visiting and wanted to watch it.  I started the disc and we waited and waited and waited for the thing to start as it went to the Internet over and over again.  After 15 minutes we gave up.<br />Today I tried it again.  After 10-15 minutes of connecting to the Internet through my wired Ethernet connect, the main menu started.  Great!  However, I made the collosal error of picking the \\"What's New!\\" menu item.  There is no way back to the main menu!  I ended up stopping the disk, restarting it and waiting another 15 minutes for it to grind its way back to the main menu.  As others have pointed out, the movie is simply not worth it.  Whatever technical voodoo Universal performed on this disc, they should stop it.  It further ruined an already bad movie.
B007YO6MRA|5.0|This is it.  The classic Earth Wind and Fire live show.  Great as their studio albums were, this LP takes it to another level as they feed off of the crowd and vice versa.<br /><br />Simply a must have recording.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|it just keeps stopping and an add would pop up and then I cant go back so I have to exit and come back!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I've been eagerly awaiting this since it was first announced, and it does not disappoint. Looks as good on a tablet as it does on a pc. A must buy for any MtG fan.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoyed this game.Everything I could want in an escape the room game. Really fun. Im not a person of many words.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|It's a good movie.  Even the 3D was enjoyable and used to enhance the storytelling and not just as some gimmick.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|It ran me off the internet page and required me to use the Play store.  That downloaded the ad loaded free game.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|With \\"Lost Symbol\\" Dan Brown takes a leap into a deeper, more philosophical message and I really enjoyed that new turn. I liked \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" and appreciated \\"Angels and Demons\\" a bit less but this read is my favorite. I did not feel cheated by a repeat recipe like some dissatisfied reviewers, the suspense reached heights it didn't reached before, the plot is even thicker than before and the \\"finale\\" is absolutely stunning... But I am weird! ;) I actually am ready to read it again...
B00AHTYGRW|1.0|I saw this movie in a theatre and my sense was that the audience was sort of interested in the plot, but probably knew little about what Iran meant some years ago etc. The film does not help; it talks and talks and talks, and Ben Aflick, without the help of George Clooney and others, would never have made it through this pseudo PBS thing.<br /><br />Notice at the Academy Awards and Golden Globe Awards how nervous and incoherent Aflick was with Clooney whom he forgot to acknowledge at both events. Clooney said later that the film's award belonged to many other people. I think Aflick knew that the award for best Picture at the Academy Awards was from left field, way left, and he felt the embarassment, the lack of deservedness. He acted like a loser.<br /><br />Even with the Clooney guidance, the film is very bad and it is a shame that it received any awards at all. The competion was way above this TV Nex Flick.<br /><br />Avoid. See The Life Of Pi!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Remarkable story. Dr. Alexander paints a beautiful picture of life beyond life.  His experience is incredibly complex but he makes it easy to understand. I'm so happy he is sharing his experience. Maybe more people will believe because of it.

B001EXE2ZG|5.0|Many movies of this quality are not shown on TV except when Robert Osborn uncovers them. Great film and very good quality
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game for th  kids. My daughter loves it. She  loves that you can take  care of the horse on it and have  to keep the stall clean, etc.
B004UID2LC|4.0|It's a good app but sometimes I have dilemmas with it.What I like about it is you can view,download as video,download as MP3,or download as ACC.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great game to play alone or with a friend as two heads are better then one any day
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The graphics are amazing and I love all the attention to details. Ive never had a horse but this is the next best thing.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I always like to finish something I start. John Corey's wit is always enjoyed.  I was 75% into the book before I can say I couldn't put it down.  Not the best of what I have grown to expect from DeMille.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is a beautifully touching book with fully fleshed-out characters and an engaging plot.  The message is lovely.  While written for middle school readers, I highly recommend it for all ages.  It would make a great family or classroom read-aloud.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Love the album so much! This is my first Coldplay CD and falling in love with this band and their amazing songs!
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|Great romantic interlude story!  Who hasn't thought about spending one night with a total stranger and sharing everything?  You'll laugh and cry!
B00006HYQ5|4.0|I wouldn't really call this a travel mouse except for the size. It would be nice it if has a retractable cord. Otherwise I love it.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|As others have noted, this doesn't work for Kindle Fire (I have one of the original Kindle Fires... it might work on the newer HD's). It froze my fire... had to shut down & restart. Then, when I attempted to open the game again, I received a message \\"app can not be opened\\". Uninstalled.  #####update 9/7/2014########  I now have a new kindle fire HDX & have changed my review from 1 star to 3 stars. Better because it does work on the Kindle Fire HDX and graphics are sharp with hints available thru videos but not 5 stars because only 10 levels, hints give the whole level away instead of being just hints, and by level 5 it felt pretty repetitive. Still, felt I needed to raise 2 stars.
B006M9NJFG|5.0|When cap is screwed on tight it doesn't leak, even tho I keep it in the hot car sometimes it hasn't warped or leaked. Low bottle taste. It fits well in its pouch, velcro is strong. Has a single belt loop on the back. Has a little pocket on the side with Bears survival leaflet. I will check in when I am able to test the cooking cup.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome app. Very interactive. Was not expecting much but is able to keep me playing. Addictive. Very much like Farmville addicting.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Twists and turns keep you wondering just where this story is going. Marvelous! Great characters and story line. Loved it.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|This game is very cute! Wish you didn't have to spend real money on peanuts.<br />The. Game practically revolves around peanuts. Soon I won't be able to go any further in the game. Other wise its a very good game.

B002BVYBC4|5.0|Completes my collection and is very entertaining!  Looking forward to the next movie (six and seven) as these great entertainment!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|good game.  the game is not so difficult that you become frustrated but challenging enough to make you use your puzzling skills.
B00AW8UK0K|4.0|the book explained the theory well and presented ways of following the diet in an easily managed way. we have both enjoyed it.
0380778556|4.0|I first got to know du Maurier by her book My cousin Rachel and was very impressed with her suspension of the story till of the end. This one is good but it's a gamble by a poor girl, in a companionship position, to be asked to marry a rich stranger. So the suspicion that something was amiss can be had by readers from the beginning.

B00BZW5W3W|5.0|Maysa is one of those singers who has such a rich musical pedigree that its even more ashamed that her own work, as many solo albums as she has, have been somewhat ignored outside the musicians community. This is someone who was a prominent member of Wonderlove,Stevie Wonder's backing band, before also becoming a featured member of the UK jazz/funk outfit Incognito-returning to that bands ever changing line up over and over because her vocal style was so well suited to their instrumental flavors. She has recorded a steady stream of solo albums since the mid 90s. Yet why is this the first one I've listened to and take the time to review here? Its yet another case of an artist with a catalog so vast and revered its difficult to know just where to start in. So in this case I thought what about the newest offering from her? Needless to say the results are anything but disappointing<br /><br />  \\"Beautiful Dreamer\\" begins the album on an expansive cinematic soul/funk ballad. \\"Sophisticated Lover\\" finds Maysa half talking the lyrics in a jazzy rap type style on a wonderful chill groove reminiscent of Paul Hardcastle's latest work. \\"Be There\\" and \\"What Can I Do\\" are heavy break and wah wah powered jazz funk that Maysa works from her soaring high range to her whispery,raspy growl-my favorite aspect of her vocals. \\"Good Morning Sunrise\\" and \\"Pouring Rain\\",both heavy on the electric piano based sunshine funk/soul groove are two of my favorites here-both on the opposite poles of emotional reflection on romance and self image. All the songs from \\"Inside My Dream\\" through \\"Quiet Fire\\" express her quieter side-full of pulsing electric pianos and plenty of instrumental adventure for slower songs of this kind.<br /><br />  \\"When Your Your Soul Answers\\" is a wonderfully layered blend of funk and chill jazz while \\"I Care\\" dives into organ heavy gospel/soul. \\"Put It On Me\\",\\"This Much\\" and \\"Nothing But You\\" are bass line heavy disco/jazz/funk numbers served up by Bluey Maunick himself. The album returns to this layered electronica style funk groove of \\"Love Me Good\\". Of course one of the things I appreciate most about Maysa's creative persona is her utter and complete devotion to adult complex emotional reflection in her lyrics-filled with clever metaphor and poetry. While still creating in a musical environment where all too many R&B/soul artists-even adults are coming at romance and social concerns from an (often immature for this as well) high school age mindset, Maysa offers up a very thoughtful sensibility. And though more a soul/funk album than a jazz one, this album is one that could be extremely inspirational to talented female singers today.The album returns to this layered electronica style funk groove of \\"Love Me Good\\".

0394800184|5.0|A little too long for children under 2 years old.  I liked it.  for older one s who can sit still.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Game was entertaining but  a bit short. G5 never disappoints the graphics were great and the ho scenes were challenging. I would definitely recommend this game
0671449028|5.0|Funny and cute at the same time. I have to read it over and over for them.  Thanks!<br />Have to hide this one so they won't put it in their mouth.
B009AMAGQM|1.0|Long story short, if you read and enjoyed the books, you will hate this movie. This movie does not follow the book at all... I think the only thing that this movie follows is character names. I couldn't even finish it, and I ALWAYS finish movies ( because I do not want reason to have to go back to \\"watch the whole movie\\"). Not worth the time. If you haven't read the book, you may like the movie.

B0097EWK3A|5.0|This game is so fun. Addictive . Excellent visual and sound effects. Takes up more space than other games but so worth it. I recommend downloading and get busy playing.
086571701X|5.0|Covers many questions I had fully. Would recommend to anyone wanting to start aquaponics! This is a great book for beginners.
B003WE9TU8|1.0|I must confess that I SO wanted to enjoy this book.  I bought it because I heard about the coming movie.  As I progressed through the book, I was increasingly disappointed, and bored.  The main problem is that the plot development is non-existent.  This book is completely devoid of any progress or building.  It was just a collection of stories relating to this World War Z - that I found increasingly similar, accounts of either running away from, or fighting Zombies in many different ways.  I really can't work out what all the fuss is about.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway surfers is a great game and i love to just sit down and play it. It is really fun and was recommended to me by my friend. When we are bored, its fun and we try to beat each others high scores. We once were playing it, with no interruptions for 2 hours!<br />A fantastic game and I know my friend would agree.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Great movie but it is kind of violent and has some offensive language. Can't figure out the digital copy but still a good movie
B00280LYIC|5.0|Awesome book!! I love Greek culture and this was an amazing book! Usually books like these are predictable but this wasn't. Suggested for kids who like surprises :P
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|It was sad but yet a novel filled with hope for the future. My hope is for more of Pendergast in the years ahead.
B008KP6ENE|4.0|I really like this game. It's fun and the controls work great. The quality of the game is nice. The only reason it doesn't get five stars is because drag n dash (the bonus game) just stops working. I'm playing it and it comes to a point where I jump and there's no platform to jump on its like the creators never finished making it or something it's weird af. Anyways great game I just wouldn't play the bonus game it's a waste...unless the creators fix it. Or maybe it'll work once you complete all the levels. I don't know..
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is pretty legit. Its like a classic game that everyone has! This game is worth playing. You just gotta love moving left and right jumping and rolling even getting power-ups!
0062255657|4.0|a beautiful creepy fairy tale with poetic images that dissappears in a poof. Enjoy the magic. Anyone whose ever had a creepy babysitter will also get special enjoyment from certain aspects. Maybe too creepy for children but enjoyed by anyone who has been a child and not forgotten.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This movie didn't show locally so we had to rent it. After watching it once my wife wanted to buy it for her collection. A bit off-beat but very good story. Both funny and serious at times but well worth the time to watch.
0062255657|5.0|Best work of fiction I've read in years.  Perhaps decades.  No doubt in my mind that a hundred years from now it will be taught in literature classes and discussed on the same level that, someone like  Lewis Carrol's works are discussed. 180 or so pages of pure reading pleasure!  I am a Gaiman fan, but this really amazed me with the beautiful flow of language and mastery of the tale.  Not to be missed.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Excellent DDL! Also, this clearly details the relationship between the Emancipation Proclamation and the subsequent neccessary 13th Amendment, which gave teeth to the E P.
B00AS1Q93S|1.0|I'm a huge Jack Reacher fan and have read all the books. Tom Cruise is NOT Reacher by any stretch of the imagination. The movie would have been better had it stuck closer to the book. The take down in the book is much better than the one in the movie and anyone who loves Reacher knows he doesn't run -- not from the cops or anyone else -- and especially not in a Camero with glasspacks that can be heard 5 miles away. I realize this is supposed to be an action movie so a car chase is almost mandatory, but it should have been left out. I wasn't going to see this movie after hearing Cruise was going to play Reacher, but decided to give it a chance. I wish I hadn't wasted my money on it, and if there are any other Reacher movies with Cruise in them, I'll pass, thanks. This movies comes under my heading of \\"must miss.\\"
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|There are examples of this kind of , I think I've been there before or I think we've met before instances in chapters on reincarnation in the Tibetan Book of the Dead.
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|This game does not have enough levels, is too easy, and if it'd weren't free I'd be kicking myself for buying it. If you've never played Mahjong before, this would be a good teaching game, but it gets very boring very fast.
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|Buying in through Kindle is confortable and assertive.  It is a very appropiate way to keep your device updated and save paper
B000W93CHC|5.0|In this book you finally find out what happens to all the characters in the first book. I was just as drawn in to what happens to the characters in this book as I was with the first book. And the one character I really hated finally gets what's coming to him. The satisfaction in seeing a fictional character &#34;get his&#34; is the definition of a good read. The characters have become &#34;real&#34; people. Again, if you like historical fiction, you'll love this.
B00BCMT4RA|5.0|If you like the blues, you better listen to this great recording. I liked so much I am going to order the LP vinyl edition as well.
B00005JLCI|1.0|This is another video I bought to use with my AP English class. It's really boring and most of the class went to sleep during this film. I wanted to go to sleep, too! The only part of the movie that captured the attention of 15 teenagers was the sword fights at the end.
1118488768|5.0|I look forward to each and every revision of The New Rules of Marketing & PR -- not only for the updated case studies and relevant new references, but also to rediscover the classic and actionable advice on practically every page.  I consider this an indispensable classic, and a must read for EVERYONE in marketing and business today. It's the book I have given as a gift to friends and coworkers like no other. We live, work, and inhabit a real-time world like never before, yet so many of us work in environments with outmoded mindsets and the &#34;same old&#34; tool kit of tricks that have an ever diminishing return. The lessons and advice in New Rules will absolutely change the way you think about and conduct your business and marketing.  (The same can be said for Newsjacking, Real-Time Marketing, The Marketing Lessons of the Greatful Dead, and all of David's books.) If you buy AND READ just one book on the subject of pr, marketing, and communications in the real-time digital landscape of ours, make it this book. You won't regret it.
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|This movie was so bad is was good. What it has not: A plot that makes sense, well developed characters, meaning. But seriously, what did you expect from a movie titled Hansel and Gretel: Witch hunters? What it has are actors that have obviously a lot of fun playing their roles and don't take themselves too seriously. Tons of gory action scenes. Pretty people. Funny dialogue. Would definitely watch this again.
1400069807|5.0|I devoured this book like I did Fastfood Nation. It is an eye opening tour deforce of the nature of our food addictions and the salt, sugar and fat &#34;dealers&#34; that keep us hooked. The story arc of our poor nutritional habits reads not only as a page turner, but also like a self-help psychotherapy book: prisoners of our biology and the chemical triggers hardwired into our bodies, the science of food addictions make it clear...we do it to ourselves. With a lot of help from our favorite drugs of choice, or should I say: brands. If you eat anything more than what you grow yourself in your garden, you owe it to yourself to read this book.
B004EHZPEG|5.0|I had a notion of designing a game. This book was recommended somewhere, I don't remember where. I read an excerpt and it seemed to offer up some good information, and a good place to start to get an overview of what is involved.<br /><br />Upon reading it, I was blown away. Schell covers everything, quite literally everything. I found that the lenses he reveals are useful regardless of what you're doing. I am an in-house designer for a major corporation and can readily see how the topics covered can help in my &#34;day job&#34;, both internally to working with the teams in the company, but also in addressing our customers and their needs.<br /><br />You won't get the technical &#34;how to code something&#34; information, or algorithms or strategies. You will get the underlying principles and guidance for building pretty much any project, games or otherwise.<br /><br />Thank you for publishing this Mr. Schell.
B002CLBJPK|5.0|I ordered this video and two more for my greatgrandaughters 6th birthday, She loves it, and wants to watch it over and over.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great game! Early levels are easy enough to learn some strategy before levels become more difficult. Challenging at a great pace, quick play.
B00A2H9PLG|1.0|This is truly the most unrealistic ridiculous movie I have ever seen.  The action, special effects, and acting were the worst I have ever seen. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE. Just move along.  Nothing to see here.<br /><br />The movie should have been called White House Down The Drain because if you buy it, you'll be flushing your money down the drain.<br /><br />What a waste of time and money.
B003V5CFV8|5.0|Just a great all around movie that you will not get tired of seeing!  Love catching the similarities with the Homer novel.
B005D0TETA|5.0|While I own the original DVD collection which is spectacular in itself I wanted to get something nice for my brother.  He has a huge projector screen setup so with the 1080P of blu ray it should enhance the experience for him more.  If you like yes this is a great concert with the symphony adding the extra depth to the recording.  Yes fidelity never sounded better to me with &#34;Keys to Ascension&#34; being the only other album with decent sound.  This is a must have.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Tis game is so fun I love it. I think that if you love temple run than you will love this game. I cannot belive that it is free too. An experience that great should cost some but the amazing team at amazon have made it free. Furthermore, I do belive that this by far is my favorite thing to do other than read on my kindle. So to wrap it up I think that you will positively love this free app.

B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I had to pull my first generation iphone out of mothballs recently and forgot it would only charge with a firewire plug. The Apple port on this device charges the iphone but I have to connect it with the screen off for it to do so. After connection I can unlock the screen and it will continue charging and I can use it. After buying questionable cell phone batteries from other manufacturers I tried Anker and I have not been disappointed. Last month I bought a replacement battery for my Toshiba laptop and it has lived up to the Anker reputation.

B00847KFDS|5.0|Not usually a fan of remakes but every now and then a set really clicks. This is one of them.  Different enough to be interesting  and the choice of collaborators is perfect. I hope he does another collection with the artists he couldn't catch up with for this one.
1781162646|5.0|Joyland is a much simpler, compact story compared to the usual lengthy, sprawling King work. It works beautifully because of this. The focus on Devin's experiences keeps the story moving at a rapid pace and the containment of the narrative to largely one place and a small group of characters harkens back to some of King's earlier novellas. Joyland eschews horror for a more understated ghost story with some neat plot twists. It is also a coming of age story, a genre in which King excels, a thriller, romance and a murder mystery. Here King seems to have striven for the kind of thoughtful, reflective narrative that evokes a wonderful yet problematic time in a man's life that we saw in `The Body'. I like King's work in this mode, his characterisation is so wonderfully constructed and explored. The `carny' world is also powerfully created - both familiar and strange.<br />Joyland is as good as anything King has done in recent years.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This is not only an amazing movie, it's a metamorphic experience: a film of such epic tragedy can make you take a hard look at your own life and rethink some of your priorities. Following what these people went through can truly make what we think of as hardships look really petty and foolish in comparison.<br /><br />THE IMPOSSIBLE is simply stunning; you'll be as astounded by the heartbreaking scope of this catastrophe as you will by the technical skill it must have taken to recreate it. When I heard that the very same hotel location was used to stage this movie, I was staggered.  It actually looks as if the whole island was inundated again by the tsunami that occurred in 2004...the shots are so realistic, so powerful, you wonder how director Antonio Bayona could have put his actors through it - especially the children.<br /><br />While this is a calamity of major proportions, THE IMPOSSIBLE does not try to show the horrors undergone by everyone; after all, such a task would have been impossible.  What Bayona does is follow one family during the tragedy, and in particular the spectacular Naomi Watts (as wife and mother Maria Bennett) and Tom Holland (as 12-year old son Lucas). They were put through hell - not just the characters, but the actors as well. Bayona does a masterful job of displaying the agonizing power of the waves, jerking Watts this way and that like a rag doll in a blender. While she was deservedly nominated for best Actress by the Academy Awards, the Screen Actors' Guild, and the Golden Globes, it's a true oversight that Holland was not: his performance is truly amazing.  It's hard to believe he had only provided the voice for a cartoon character before this movie. So much of the story depends upon the strength he gathers during the nightmare to somehow pull his family together; it's a powerhouse performance that displays what must be a bright future ahead.<br /><br />It is an amazing story all of its own, but to realize that it's true makes it truly astonishing. Yet there are some who have found fault with this movie...without my giving away details of the tale, they criticize the fact that the story centers upon a white family of privilege, when so many Thais are used as background, their suffering marginalized. But this is, after all, Maria's story: she wrote the book upon which the story is based, cataloging the agonies her family went through. It's hard to argue with the film's priorities at that, I think. Certainly the island's horrific torment is here to see, and their agonies are clear. That it focuses on one family actually gives it an immediacy that a wider scope might have missed. It is a story about her struggles, but writ large.<br /><br />I remember immersing myself in the tragedy when it occurred back in 2004, eventually feeling that I had come to an understanding about their struggles and the horrors they went through. But the impact of this movie hit me like a ton of bricks: there is NO way to understand what survivors of such an event must feel. While the force of the waves themselves was staggering, of course, equally horrendous was the disappearance of society, the total stripping away of the structure we always take for granted. Despite any struggles that we go through we always expect that the world will stop and take care of us in our times of need.  Yet THE IMPOSSIBLE is effective at showing us that here ALL is lost and even society itself has been shattered. Not even a bureaucracy can survive such an event.  This movie makes the presence of a simple orange as a thing of beauty, equally so the immediacy of a cell phone. The simple act of someone saying, \\"Can I help you?\\" is an achingly powerful act of generosity when it is so clear that EVERYONE is suffering here...no one came out unsullied in this tragedy. There is a moment when the central character opens her eyes and asks a three-word question I've heard said in other movies, but here it is an astonishingly powerful three-word phrase: \\"Am I dead?\\"<br /><br />See THE IMPOSSIBLE. It is at once terrifying and reassuring, blisteringly painful yet comforting, heart wrenchingly sad, yet tearfully happy. It is about the stripping away of everything we thought was permanent and the building of a firmament in its place. We see for the first time inside this tragedy, yet we emerge outside with a reborn spirit. It is a powerful, frightening, sad, hopeful, and wonderful movie.e: \\"Am I dead?\\"<br /><br />See THE IMPOSSIBLE. It is at once terrifying and reassuring, blisteringly painful yet comforting, heart wrenchingly sad, yet tearfully happy.

B00CDV6WDS|5.0|This is for me a refreshment break.  Completely takes my mind away from current &#34;issues&#34; as I relax and enjoy the game, my break from the numbers involved in my accounting work!
1623420148|4.0|I will start off by saying that this book is not for everyone. This is narrated from the male POV and Drew? Well, he's something else. Personally? I flippin' LOVED Drew. His voice is hilarious, witty, and just pure douchebag male. I've always preferred hanging out with guys, so I'm used to the vulgarity, crudeness, and chauvinism. I guess, as a female, I should be disgusted- and there were definitely times I wanted to throttle Drew for being a pig, but I'm just not one of those females who gets easily offended by those kinds of things. My friend, on the other hand, gets quite upset when he hears guys swearing and being perverted around us females. I try to explain to him that we don't care, but he is very respectful of females and gets really irritated during those times.    The book starts off during present day with Drew complaining about having the 'flu'. I couldn't help but laugh: Who has pizza boxes and beer cans littering their apartment if they have the flu? Poor Drew. He is suffering from a broken heart. Which is a first ever for him. Drew Evans doesn't do feelings. (At least not feelings of the heart!) And then Kate Brooks waltzes into his life and changes everything.    \\"Women fall in love quicker than men. Easier and more often. But when guys fall? We go down harder. And when things go bad? When it's not us who ends it? We don't get to walk away.  We crawl.\\"    Kate is smart, beautiful, and does not take s***. She also happens to be unavailable. Yet, a tiny little thing like that is not enough to deter Drew. He is used to getting what he wants and Kate Brooks is what he wants.    Drew, however, has his work cut out for him. Working under his father at their successful banking firm, Kate is the last person he thought his father would introduce as their new associate. Kate happens to be brilliant at her job and Drew knows it's game on. He's not about to let her come in and take over what's rightfully his. Let the pissing contest begin! These two are now constantly at each other's throats with Drew trying to solidify his Top Dog status and Kate trying to prove that she is capable of succeeding at this job. Kate makes it clear Drew will never get what he wants from her and Drew is insistent that she is going to crack under pressure. He knows dating a fellow co-worker is a big no-no and tries to justify it by saying since he technically met her before he knew they were working together makes it ok. Drew is quite a persistent guy. As I said- he doesn't like to lose. He wants Kate and he plans to have her. And he knows he has to play his cards just right.    The chemistry between these two is off the charts. It's incredibly sexy to watch them go from screaming and yelling at each other to trying to rip the other's clothes off. And when they do finally give in to one another- holy freaking hell. There's something even sexier about the fact that it's Drew doing the narrating. He doesn't hold back on his thoughts and yeah- it's hot.    So how does Drew end up with the 'flu'? Well, remember Kate was technically unavailable. She is engaged to her long time boyfriend, Billy, of 7 years. As soon as I read that, I was like \\"Oh girl. No, no, no, NO.\\" And then when we meet Billy for the first time? Yeah, I didn't like him at all. Drew had already won me over at that point. Which is funny because Drew is a complete douche! Why anyone would root for him is beyond me! (Well played, Emma Chase- well played.) But Billy isn't the issue. Drew getting the flu is ALLLLLL Drew. He jumps to conclusions, makes assumptions, and talks out of his ass. Good job, buddy. Karma really is a bitch.    Hands down the best part of this book besides the super smexy romance? Drew not only narrates- he gives the readers advice. There are points where he'll stop his narrative and talk to the readers. And it's SO awesome.    \\"Newsflash, ladies: We can't read your thoughts. And frankly, I'm not entirely sure I'd want to. The female mind is a scary place to be.\\"\\"The point is, when you ask, \\"What do you want for dinner?\\" we're thinking about screwing you on the kitchen counter. When you're telling us about the sappy film you watched with your girlfriends last week, we're thinking about the porno we saw on cable last night. When you show us the designer shoes you bought on sale, we're thinking how nice they would look on our shoulders.    I just thought you'd want to know. Don't shoot the messenger\\"    There is one female Drew has a soft spot for. He adores his niece Mackenzie. He may refer to his sister as \\"The Bitch\\", but his niece is everything. She is adorable and really shows a tender side to Drew.    \\"Mackenzie raises her hand proudly. \\"I have a bagina.\\"  I smirk. \\"Yes, you do sweetheart. And someday, it's gonna help you rule the world.\\"    However, that doesn't stop him from saying inappropriate things in front of her. That's ok though. His sister is not without a plan.    \\"Idiots annoy me.\\" Mackenzie holds up the jar again, and in goes another dollar. The jar? It was invented by my sister, who apparently thinks my language is too harsh for her offspring. It's the Bad Word Jar. Every time someone--usually me--swears, they have to pay a dollar. At this rate, that thing is going to put Mackenzie through college.\\"    Ok. In conclusion: This book is hilarious. Chase does not hold back with Drew and that really made this book a really entertaining read for me. Add in humor, romance, and enough sexual tension to make you melt- you've got yourself a great afternoon read
B0078JOAOI|3.0|The first season had nice direction and storyline going. That all goes to shit the second season. Overhyped and overrated. The storyline gets drawn out and development is slow. Seriously awful second season.
0553801473|4.0|Not as good as the first four books, but for me the splitting in half of the last two was a grievous error, and makes it feel like moving backwards having to follow other stories from an earlier timeline again. But it's good writing still, and I love following Arya's chapters the most.

B0060MYK7G|5.0|The action, acting and story line is so true to history.  Every episode keeps you on edge.  It is interesting to compare the politics of those days to the worldwide politics of today.  Greed, power, money, it's all there.  Plus plenty of torrid sex.  Unbelievable that a pope in the Catholic Church could act in such a way, but no one ever said that all popes were holy and good.  A great series.

B00BCSBU4E|3.0|I was very excited when the news appeared that Universal was going to issue a box with Archiv Produktion's recordings. When the box arrived that excitement was soon reduced to frustration when I found out that a great many of the included recordings had also been included in previous big boxes from Universal. Thus I ended up with sometimes 3 copies of the same recording. This does not diminish the quality of the recordings and performances, only that Universal seems not to have cared about those customers who had already supported them in purchasing other big boxes from them. Archiv had many, many recordings that deserve to be heard again and that were omitted. I am thinking mainly about the great 60's and 70's recordings, discs by Eduard Muller, August Wenzinger etc.<br />I ended up returning this box because I was not interested in 3 copies of many digital recordings of questionable quality. Shame on Universal. Next time they issue a box, I'll wait until it is fully known what they are trying to get their customers into that time. A very big missed chance!

B00AZKCU7G|1.0|Spielberg must love to watch paint dry because he has managed to make a movie that is just as boring and lifeless as 'War Horse.' That movie was terrible and likewise 'Lincoln' is a waste of John Williams. Williams has done much better as well. The score is very minimalist and barely noticeable.  Daniel Day-Lewis under performs as Lincoln by using a whispery slumbering accent. By the end of the two and a half hour snorefest I thought he sounded like Bob Dylan. Sally Field is one of the few, maybe the only, good performance in the film. Jason Gordon Levitt is fine as Lincoln's son, but he is only in the movie to set off what might be the best scene between Abe and Mary.  Another thing this movie shares in common with 'War Horse' is that it's mostly fictional. Lincoln is shown to be the instigator and primary lobbying force behind the 13th Amendment. There is no historical evidence to support that. He was never an abolitionist and by all accounts he had to be pressured into supporting the Amendment by the real emancipators in Congress.  Most of the dialogue is made up as are most of the scenes. Lincoln is seen as a god by black soldiers who recite the Gettysburg Address verbatim back to him. Spielberg makes the mistake of giving a historical drama the values of today. The Gettysburg Address was not famous in Lincoln's lifetime and wouldn't be for years.  Lincoln is more myth than man and Spielberg does a disservice by perpetuating it. Besides the historical inaccuracies it's just not a good drama. The assassination does not even happen on screen. There is only one great little battle scene in the beginning that is worth watching. If only he had decided to make a Civil War version of 'Saving Private Ryan' instead of this.  I forgot to mention the glaring lack of vampires in this story.

B00005QGAZ|5.0|I wore out my first CD so that should tell you how much I enjoy this CD.  Michael at his best... Billie Jean, Thriller and on and on and on.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|I think it is a fun game but you should have more time to make and build things in it.
B00000J2PH|5.0|This CD includes many of her best songs.  It is a great addition to my music collection.  It is fun to listen to some of the older stuff sometimes.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Kinda hard at times. Wish there was more levels and clues. There also needs to be less colors used. That's it.

B000FBJAEG|5.0|Baldacci's King and Maxwell series is one of my favorites.  The relationship between them is complicated, their past careers have been complicated, everything is complicated and yet, the two of them make it all work and the books are a great read.

B000FCKGPC|5.0|What can I say that hasn't been said? This is a good book. Martin will not disappoint you....except maybe by killing a character you've grown to love. But that's what makes this series great. Any happy endings will be earned and well-deserved and not just handed out because the character is a &#34;good guy&#34;.

006178480X|5.0|The Eye of God<br />James Rollins<br />Morrow, Jun 25 2013, $27.99<br />ISBN: 9780061784804<br /><br />At the DOD Space and Missile System Center in El Segundo, California, concerned Director Painter Crowe tells DARPA General Metcalf and key research physicist Dr. Jada Shaw something is wrong with the satellite studying the dark matter that birthed the universe.  The vivid pictures transmitted show the eastern seaboard in total ruins from an apparent meteor.  Ground control tries to shut down \\"The Eye of God\\" satellite, but fails as the IOG obtained an external energy source.  The satellite crashes in Mongolia.  Crowe and Metcalf agree IOG must be retrieved before the Chinese or worse obtain the satellite.<br /><br />In Rome, Christian archeology and Vatican archivist of secrets Monsignor Vigor Verona receives an ancient parchment bound in human skin and a skull with eye lashes sent by long dead Fr. Josip Tarasco.  Vigor tells his niece Rachel this is The Gospel of Thomas, which declares the end of the world in four days.<br /><br />Sigma Force Commander Gray Pierce directs part of his team already in Mongolia searching for Khan Era artifacts to retrieves the satellite or what is left of it.  At the same time he leads a unit accompanying Fr. Tarasco and his niece into China as DNA testing proved the skin and skull from the ancient tome was once Genghis Khan.  They hope to learn why Attila turned away from Rome and why the empire fell anyway.  All converge in a sacred home of Genghis Khan.<br /><br />The latest Sigma Force thriller (see Bloodline) is an exhilarating action-packed tale that smoothly combines an end of the world scenario with quantum physics, and ancient Rome and Mongol history.  Gripping throughout, readers will appreciate James Rollin's taut thriller as the end of days countdown begins.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B000002J3W|5.0|This record is killer.  Brutal.  Listening to their debut (which is damn good in its own right) vs. Subhuman Race is quite unfair.  Bob Rock's production is extrordinary.  The sound is just so much meatier: similar to what he did with the John Corabi Motley Crue album.  Yet as heavy as it is, there are also hooks and melodies.  Hints of Rush.  Criminally underrated effort.  Check out \\"My Enemy\\", \\"Firesign\\", \\"Eileen\\", \\"Remains to Be Seen\\", \\"Into Another\\" and \\"Breakin' Down\\" if you don't believe me.  Skid Row started on this path with Slave to the Grind.  Subhuman Race brings it full circle...
B008JFUPLC|5.0|If you liked Pixar's classic film, Monsters Inc., then you will love this prequel!<br /><br />Monsters University re-introduces us to Mike and Sully when they first meet as college students in the reknowned Scaring Program at Monsters University.  Competition is fierce to graduate from the program in order to go work as a \\"scarer,\\" an occupation similar to a rock star.  While Mike is very smart and studies very hard, Sully slouches through the program riding on the reputation of his father, a famous scarer.  Needless to say, these two don't much care for each other until an unfortunate incident gets them booted from the program and they must work together to attempt to get re-enrolled.<br /><br />I love reacquainting with these characters as their younger selves, when the insecurities of youth are evident.  It is fun to see how they met and how their friendship and careers have blossomed over time.<br /><br />True to all of the charm and idiosyncracies that made us fall in love with them the first time, this is another great Pixar film.<br /><br />Also, the PIxar short that proceeds the movie about umbrellas working in the city is charming as well!
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game! it is so fun. and very easy too. I told my friends about this game and they love it to! you should get this game.
B0090KZDSK|4.0|I liked how fast paced this book was. I just didn't want it to end and then I wanted more.....
1878424319|5.0|I think every human being should read this book and it should be required reading in Junior High. If we could all live by the golden rule, we would have such peace in our lives and the world. This is not a religious book, per say, but a book of common sense and how to apply it in our lives. My copy is worn out and I have bought this book for at least 10 people in my life. It's really an enlightening little carry around.
B003Y5H5HO|1.0|I bought this movie expecting to get a real and actual disk instead I got a burned DVD with the girl w/ the dragon tattoo scribbled all over it it was bull and am extremely unhappy with this purchase

B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway Surfers is a AWESOME game, it is a lot of fun trying to out run the guy that is chasing you.  You can use a jetpack and sometimes you can find a mystery box on your course. You can use real money to upgrade or buy gadgets, but it's not required. It's basically like Temple Run only with cooler gadgets.

B0090SI4LU|5.0|This movie is excellent. The story, the characters, the scenery, it is magnetic, Melanie is beautiful, and the seeker is very pretty too. The story is not the typical \\"aliens invade earth\\" movie. The story is amazing. I never read the book but I am going to buy the trilogy and I am going to digest it. This movie deserves a sequel, and a trilogy.
B000FA675C|5.0|Decided to read this one again to get ready for Inferno. I like the way Dan Brown uses a mixture of fact and fiction to produce a great mystery. I hope the next one comes out a little quicker Dan.

B005MYEQ4U|5.0|To see Paris in this modern and yet historical fashion is brilliant.  A magical spell lets various characters decide their future, or is it really a future...but the past?
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|Been a fan since the 80's, and really haven't liked much they have done since Empire, so with DeGarmo long gone and getting rid of Tate, I really wasn't sure what to expect. Then I starting hearing bits online and dug what I was hearing, but my expectations were still pretty low, at best I was hoping for a couple decent songs. Boy was I wrong! This album is killer, great songs, hooks, playing, and new singer Todd LaTorre really does an awesome job, his voice has a slightly different timbre than Tate but retains a lot of the same vocal stylings. The only real downside is that it is a short album, but at least it leaves you wanting more, instead of wishing you wouldn't have pissed away $12. LOL
B0063GORYU|4.0|I always played Spider on my pc. This app is just as good as that one. I would recommend this app to anyone who likes to play Spider.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|We need a saving option to where we can just log in from other devices where we left off with purchased characters, boards, money, and awards. It is difficult to have to start from scratch but still have the same high score from Facebook login.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|I give this five stars because its a 5 star movie, here is what you might not know about ordering from amazon.<br /><br />I bought this specifically for the digital copy. When I received it there was a brand new box around it. Pulled off the box and noticed it had crappy shrink wrap. Then I noticed there wasn't any tape on the top of the movie. Opened the movie and no sign of the digital copy piece of paper and finger prints on the discs.<br /><br />I immediately request a replacement, which doesn't get overnighted for some reason. Now I can't get it till next week which is too late and not one thing was done by amazon. At least I wasted all your customer care's time just to return it. I am sure what you paid her is about the difference of a quick resolve. instead of even attempting to put any blame on me at all.<br /><br />WORSE AMAZON EXPERIENCE EVER!

B004GHNIRK|5.0|Having seen the musical on Broadway and the story in several movie versions, I felt a need to read the story as Victor Hugo wrote it. I am so glad that I did! Of course, I was planning to see Anne Hathaway and Hugh Jackman in what is now the recent release of a musical version on film. The novel is so eloquently written, I was captured and could not put the tome down. I am a former history teacher and truly appreciate the asides made my Hugo to explain the realities of the time period. I've heard some complain that \\"he goes on and on with this extraneous things,\\" but that is the meat of the story. Without his \\"asides\\" where he asks the reader to excuse him for taking the time to explain certain characters' pasts or certain historical events as they developed, Les Miserables really would not be complete. Kudos to the readers who savor every word. For those who want a quick plot without historical context, skip the classics. Hugo's work has all of the elements that make a great classic. I know I will read it again.....and again.
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|Not disappointed ! Same great voice as when she was with ABBA .Not a bad song in the bunch either. Loved it .
B00CWY76CC|3.0|What a fun game for being free.  Really makes you use your mind.  Way too short though.  When are more rooms coming?

0062515675|5.0|A friend lent me this book, my first by Mr. Sharma.  I didn't know what to expect.  The first chapter didn't grab my attention.  However, as I read on, it became an emotional journey, for I needed to be reminded of what I have held as truths...but had lost myself due to stress factors.  I am now refocused and back on my journey...<br /><br />I now have my own copy to remind me whenever I start to 'lose' myself again...
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I read all three books in the series. I enjoyed the first two books so much I couldn't wait for the third one to come out.  The following were the problems I found with the book:<br />1. It wasn't written as well as the first two.<br />2. It was too short, & there seemed to be a lot of fillers.<br />3. It seemed to me it ended abruptly, is there going to be a third book? Please let me know.
B00B9HTK1S|4.0|I enjoyed the story the plot was amazing for a book I had to read  for school didn't mind it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Tis is such a good book for adults and children,  it's a very quick read and enjoyable as long as you aren't someone who gets hung up on the idea of children killing each other
B0012HCASA|4.0|The alchemy of writers, director and actor Summer Glau brought to life a unique, interesting, enigmatic yet palpably real Cameron. The series was entertaining enough with a lot more human substance than many other TV series, although, I would have liked the series to continue if only to see Cameron's existential voyage come to some sort of conclusion.
B00001NTXN|5.0|I love this game. Very addicting and can be enjoyed by all ages for many hours!  We lost several pieces to our previous one and we couldn't ever find a replacement until now!  Thanks amazon!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book. It's not really a zombie book. It's more about how our world would handle a major problem. It looks at the political,social,economic,and personal reactions to a work wide pandemic.
B00BY8DIT2|4.0|Beth sings with more passion on Don't Explain. Don't Explain's song selection was better. It's nice to see Joe allow others to step out front. A good choice to hear both at their best.

B00BURWSHA|3.0|Doug Aldrich is my absolute favorite guitar player in the world. I love his work in Whitesnake, Bad Moon Rising, and Lion. However, I was a little disappointed in this album to be quite honest. This sounds almost exactly like a band trying to rip off Whitesnake, and not in a good way either. I love Whitesnake as much as the next guy, but this was a little uninspired to me.<br /><br />The positive things about this album are production, song writing, and Doug's guitar playing. The problem for me is with the execution of the album. I was expecting something a little more hard rock sounding; I wasn't expecting Doug and co. to release an album of Whitesnake B-sides. To be fair though, the record is decent enough throughout. Some songs are really strong and carry the album along nicely; however, some other songs are such blatant filler, it's almost painful to listen to. The songs I liked were \\"My Lust Your Fate,\\" \\"Heaven Gets Me By\\" and \\"Ride the Monkey,\\" and a couple others were solid as well.<br /><br />I guess I may be too tough on this album because of what I expect from Doug Aldrich. I may listen to this again in a little while and decide it's better than I gave it credit for being. Who knows?

B0076UXKDG|3.0|Bought the Meike battery grip but started having issues with the grip within a few months and the camera started to switch to the internal battery even when the battery in the grip still has charge. As a result I decided to just bite the bullet and get the nikon version. The Nikon grip feels a whole lot better and much more sturdy and well built. Also I haven't has any battery switching issues so far. However, I still think the Nikon MB-D12 is very overpriced. If this grip was even priced at $250 I woud have readily bought it, but the current price is ridiculous.

0316223239|3.0|Something I've started to notice about Emma Donoghue: all her books feel like they're just nearly on the side of great, but not quite. Room was not an exception.<br /><br />I've actually owned a copy of Room for a year or so, but only bothered to read it last month. I didn't know exactly what it was about, so it felt like a bizarre coincidence when I started it, only weeks after three women in my town were discovered after they had gone missing ten years prior. They had been held captive by a man, in his house, and one even had a daughter that was born and raised in captivity.<br /><br />Room is an eerily similar story, and I found myself engrossed in the book from page one, but I'm not entirely certain if that was because the book itself merited my attention, or if it just resonated with me given the rather bizarre timing of when I finally chose to read it.<br /><br />The book is told in the first person narrative of Jack, a five year old boy, whose entire world is comprised of the small room in which he and his mother are being held captive. Jack's mother was abducted, and gave birth to Jack in the room- his birth giving her the endurance and will to keep hoping that one day she might escape or be rescued. As a mother, she's aces. Not wanting Jack to realize he's in a prison, she invents a world that exists entirely in the room itself, and makes Jack sleep in a wardrobe at night if she knows her captor is coming to rape her.<br /><br />The concept is fascinating, but Donoghue's telling of it falls flat at times.<br /><br />The most obvious problem is with our protagonist: Jack is 5, and has a limited understanding of reality- which doesn't really make for good story telling. At times, it's downright annoying- he anthropomorphizes everything, from the rug he was born on, to the bed, the dresser, the tv, etc.. This is brilliant in the sense that, Donoghue writes it very much in the way you would imagine a 5 year old perceives the world, but it's redundancy gets tiresome.<br /><br />By the second and third chapters, I was growing impatient- not knowing if it was going to be about an eventual escape, or just their lives in the room- and plans to abandon it were becoming more and more likely. So perhaps Donoghue's best move was inititating the action precisely when she did- a mere page or two before I planned to throw it back on the book pile. A brilliant use of anticipation, or a lucky sense of timing? I'm still not sure.<br /><br />The latter half of the book covers Jack and his mom's various escape attempts, and their trouble acclimating to life once out. At times, this is almost as slow moving as the first half, due to our narrators age, and inability to verbalize or comprehend the emotional nightmare that he and his mother were struggling with. When I finally did get to the end, I felt like a satisfactory point had been chosen for it, but still wasn't entirely sure how I felt about the book as a whole.<br /><br />And as it turns out, Donoghue did base her story (albeit loosely) on a real case: that of Elisabeth Fritzl; an Austrian woman, who was held captive for some 24 years by her father, along with three of the six children she conceived by him while captive.<br /><br />It was this outside content that gave me a deeper respect for Room. After reading about the Fritzl case and several other similar ones, it became clear that the author had done some meticulous research. While the emotional aspect of the book was somewhat lacking and failed to to stir up any real sense of attachment to the characters in me, the description of the characters struggle to reintegrate to society, & he trauma and resulting challenges Jack and his mother face are spot on with those described by Elizabeth Fritzl and her children.<br /><br />It was an interesting read, but the reasons why I felt this way are a little more ambiguous. The research and related books I read because of it were definitely worth reading Room to come to, so in the end, I'll give it a 3.5 for that, and for at least trying something a little out of the ordinary.l give it a 3.5 for that, and for at least trying something a little out of the ordinary.
B00AQO1VYY|5.0|Amazing line up and the musicianship on this album is incredible. A very underrated band/release. Live footage is excellent but would have been better if it was in sequence with the live performance without having to go back to menu constantly.
B005SAP45I|3.0|Obviously Pixar stands leagues above all other animation studios.  &#34;Cars 2&#34; is much better than most animated fare that is available (&#34;Robots&#34;, &#34;hoodwinked&#34;, &#34;Jimmy Newtron&#34;, etc.).  However, relative to the standards that Pixar has set over the last ~20 years, &#34;Cars 2&#34; is a disappointing movie.  If you thought Mater was grating the first time around, get ready to have him be the center of attention.  If you thought Mater was the best part of &#34;Cars&#34;, then prepare to have him go on an empty adventure with a back-handed character arc.  Of the 14 Pixar films that currently exist, this is definitely #14.  Again, that ranking only holds relative to Pixar films.

B000MV90IU|5.0|I actually bought this for the special feature, The Cutting Edge: The Magic of Movie Editing. That feature presentation alone sells for $23 separately on Amazon, but here it is included with the movie. The movie is a lot of fun to watch, completely old school filmmaking, and the DVD also includes a nice biography on Steve McQueen as well, which provides a lot of background about him I never knew. Overall, you can't really go wrong at this price point...it is 3 DVDs in one.

B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Enjoyed the book, can't wait for next one. Love their romance.  When is the release date for the next book?
030758836X|2.0|This is a well written book, extremely intricate and an unpredictable plot. However, the characters and story line are depressing, sad, and just ugly, unlovable people. Both lead characters you end up disliking and actually repulsed from. It is the destruction of a marriage and the twisted minds of a couple that have pushed each other to the edge, but yet still stay stangely in and also out of the marriage. I finished the book, but I felt empty and sad after reading it. It was well written, but certainly not a fulfilling read.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is a super fun game and I spend a lot of time on it.  The reason I deducted a star is because the games I have on there I do not know how to play, and even though I read the instructions, I still do not know how to play them.  Fun game tho!!!
B002KKCW8Q|4.0|Great shoe I have wide feet so I bought a 13 instead of a 12 and it's perfect maybe looks a little long but is very adjustable and feels natural when walked in.
1416575464|2.0|I ordered this book to get some decorating ideas.  Unfortunately I didn't see much that I liked.  There were a lot of pictures but the style in the book doesn't match my personal style.
B0068PHS5Q|4.0|This is a book of mystery which pulls you in so that you must stay with it and hear the end. Not perfect but a good read.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I heard this was a great movie so I was expecting more.  I basically knew the plot before I watched the movie but I expected more action and special effects.  The movie was decent but not as great as I thought it would be.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Great characters, absorbing story, beautifully written, evocative and full of deep feeling. I loved it as much as Kite Runner.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is terribly fun and quite addicting! The graphics are good.  You will sit down to play and find that at an hour has passed. Worth checking out.
0143034901|5.0|Carlos Ruiz Zafon is a gifted writer.  This book, like his others, is a dark, haunting and beautifully written, suspenseful story.  What I love about this Zafon is his ability to string together beautiful, evocative words that leave a lasting impression on the reader.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I love this keyboard. I won't use anything else. I've tried several others and nothing compares. This is a must for any smartphone.
B0053O89YM|5.0|To me, this series is about how to succeed in the business/political world, what makes a good leader, and how intellect, people skills and strategy are everything.  Yet another great season with a talented ensemble cast.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Really fun and clever, I was extremely disappointed when I as solved all the levels, so I really hope there will be more levels coming soon.
B003L77G10|5.0|The great acting continues and we learn more about each character and what drives them.  Politics, strategy, courtroom drama, sarcasm and dry wit...Love this series.
1781162646|5.0|If you've feared Stephen King's writing thinking it's just too scary - this is a great option to experience King's style of writing with just the right amount of mystery, blood and in-depth character building. Also, this book explores the various realms of personal struggle - from the main character himself, who is a college student on the mend from a first-love break up, to a child in a wheelchair and the mother who is trying to get a grip on the reality of her son's condition. The central, back story, of course, is the murder of a young lady in a small-town amusement park. Most of the story revolves around the main character's experiences working at the amusement park.<br /><br />Overall, the book starts out slow and gains momentum, ending in an arousing and heart-pounding ride on the ferris wheel. I highly recommend Joyland.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Absolutely loved it! I watched all three episodes in a row, couldn't stop!  These are better than a lot of movies; well written, well casted, and captivating.  Benedict Cumberbatch became my new favorite actor, too!  Does a great job of tracking Sherlock's thoughts without giving everything away all at once; the plot steadily unfolds for the entire episode.  One dislike: episode 3 has a horrible cliff-hanger ending.
030758836X|3.0|This is a book that will leave you thinking it over whether you liked it or not. It is full of mystery, false leads, cads and other despicable characters.
B0059WTMLW|5.0|Between Solitaire, some books, and THIS Sudoku, I am a happy Fire user. It took me a while to try some of the different styles (%, Super, color blocks, etc.), and now I have my favorites that I switch between. I played with 4 different Sudokus before happily settling on this one!<br /><br />I can choose a difficulty level depending on how much time I have, and my mood. ;)<br /><br />I love it. I play it EVERY day. On breaks, before bed, in the bathroom.<br /><br />I don't know what the flurry analytics is about. I don't see anything in settings for it. Maybe that was an earlier version.
B00B8M4IMK|1.0|I only need to tell you this: the product just worked one day and when it stopped working it also ruinned my car`s lighter. Please, learn from my experience a do not buy it.
B007K87C4M|5.0|Just thought I'd get that fact out first. Very dark. Occasional moments of pure beauty. And, surprisingly great vocals from Steven and Mickael. Buy the 5.1 surround blu-ray disc.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game but I was bummed when I found out there is only ten levels and I couldn't play anymore!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|pretty cool....enjoyed figuring out the levels ......bring on more!  why did you stop at 10 levels?  Takes some time...need paper to write down some clues.
B00338QENI|4.0|The woman who unknowingly contributed so much to research shouldn't go unknown. Take the first step by reading this book.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|best game ever........... nothing like it....... awesome....... amazing speck. tab. Etta. Poe. it is coop cool... very coop cop dido's man awesome
B002VPE1WK|2.0|Actually there is a lot of space and pockets with zippers but can't be used as intended because the straps are coming apart the first use.<br />Two light weight Cameras, Five Lenses only one is heavy, Two Extra Batteries and a couple of cleaning cloth...not much weight considering that a back pack with all that space is designed and intended for that specific use but one of the shoulder strap is coming apart.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It was painfully beautiful. I laughed and I cried. I connected even though I congregate to the cancer aspect of the book. It was just beautiful, a beautiful tale of love and acceptance.
B009E9R1IM|5.0|Great concert and great sounding vinyl. The live concert extended play is very fitting for the format. Do I have to say more? Its Led Zeppelin!
B00B7Y0206|1.0|It's so much easier to just go to my browser on my kindle or computer than it is to use this app. It's not that it's hard to maneuver, it's just like the site, except the videos never play. Ever! You'll sit there waiting forever to load and it never will. Do not buy! It's not worth any price.
B004XWLN20|5.0|Hard to pass up a deal like this. Wish there is a Blu-ray equivalent but HD wasn't huge back in the beginning of this show. Great show regardless
B00DI75SWM|5.0|I love this app. It was totally different from what I thought that it was going to be. Loved it!
B00ACP3OOM|5.0|I am 40+yr old male trying to lose wieght by low impact swimming.<br />My 30 min non stop laps were becomming tedious and needed a boost.<br />Having my own music was the key, i am swimming 50+ mins now using the neptune was a no brainer.<br />The audio is about radio quality to my mind but i would suggest an ear full of water and boredom or an ear full of inspiring mp3's?, you choose.<br />I think making the choice to go for the best first has paid off, simple design, fitting and use, using a swimmers snorkel with ear putty and comfortable goggles all work together making this product a thorough ++ recommendation to other swimmers.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|awesome fun hard at times creatful brilliant nice strategy  this app is crazy its fune i play it as a challenge with my buddy flower i waont want to ever get off of my tablet ever again ya know because its so fun
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I thought it was really fun still working on it but this is fun challenging in some spots then u r like oh it's right in front of your face! Really lime this game
B008476HBM|5.0|Without a doubt, this is by far Jane Austin's most well written work!  She surely was a lady well informed.
B002OG5GT8|1.0|This thing barely, if at all increases sound quality. I tried it for a while and after about two days of light use, it began to cause buzzing and chirping noises that overloaded speakers make. I'd try something else if I were you.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|This Video says it all and Fred Astaire said it best, \\"No one moves like Michael Jackson.\\"  Very sad to see you go Michael!  Very grateful. to say the least, of the shows you left us.  I'm sad that you were abused by the California system in so many ways.  I can only imagine what it would have been like to be present at this concert. For anyone that wants to see a video representation of the very best... This is it.
B0042816YK|5.0|I LOVED this movie.  Julia Roberts did an excellent job!!  I think we could all relate to Julia Roberts character.  I was surprised at the negative reviews.  How could anyone not like this movie.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|I updated it and all I see is a black screen and nothing pops up or anything. Other than the update I love the game but until the update I don't even play it now cause nothing will pop up
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This is arguably one of the best shows on television in a long time. The DVD makes it convenient to watch in binge watching sessions, and it was great seeing the behind the scenes features on both seasons, (something not available on Netflix). DVD quality was great, and at a fabulous price. Thanks amazon :)
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is a very interesting game. It takes a lot of patience and observation to complete. Can't wait for the next one.
B002LC2DQ4|4.0|Was looking for a memory card compatible with my Fuji fine pix from ages ago, and this worked perfectly! Thanks amazon :)
B005ZUR724|5.0|Very entertaining. I enjoy playing over the net with friends. Make good fun. I play much. Good times. I like food.
B009VB97EY|1.0|Got so bored with it, had to turn it off early. Not good story or acting, I don't know why I wasted the money on it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|When I first got it was kind of hard to figure out but the game helped so I could play right on through. In my opinion it is good for ages 5 through13.
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|Not his best book but still a good read - Would recommend it to anyone to who likes his other books
B009UX2YAC|5.0|subway surfers is the best game ever! it's really fun and addicting at times. pop ups show up at the beginning and it gets kinda annoying but it's still 5 star worthy. '-' =>
0060555661|4.0|Benjamin Graham is the father of value investing and margin of safety; his most famous disciple is Warren Buffett.  Jason Zweig illuminates Graham's instructions, updates the work for changes in the regulatory system and investing product offerings, and clarifies how to apply Graham's fundamental principles to modern day investing.  Easy to read, informative, and challenging for modern traders and flippers, who feel that they must do something each day.  Sometimes, chosing not to invest is a decision.
B005K17RU0|1.0|I don't write reviews but am feel compelled to this time. As I said in the title, the update is a disappointment. Too much extraneous information and runs slowly. Sorry I updated.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I've really been enjoying this game it's easy to catch on and its one I would call a truly free game. In this game you have the option to buy but not the necessity,the time lines are great at 30mins and up compared to some that take close to 2days to mature anything. The items are fairly priced for the plants that produce not to mention you have the ability to make your boosters,where in most games after u spend what's giving to you in the beginning you would have to buy more with actual money to not have to wait an exuberant amount of time. Only down side the mystery fish that come in glitch I bought all the hints and still can't get the achievement to clear or the fish to &quot;stay&quot; but other than that I can't complain.
B00007LTIL|5.0|Brought the album way back when and always thought true representation of American music following \\"European invasion.\\" \\"American Beauty\\" perfect title. rock, folk rock, blue grass. had it all. whole album just flowed like one long song. Brought recent CD as a gift to fill in a gap in an ex-serviceman's collection as he entered training around period of time album originally released (1970).
B002M5E2DW|5.0|It was totally validating seeing the parts of my dreams and goals all summed up in one neat package... bravo for allowing me to positively tweak my life one more time!  Life is getting better and better!
B0016OMFNY|5.0|This is my 3rd copy as the 1st two disappeared over time!! Never lost a CD before or since! Something strange, huh? But, point is, well worth replacing though this is stripped down package, just the single CD. Already have the Deluxe version/packaging, minus key CD!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Offers both fun and challenge. Tasks are possible with a little thinking and logic. Frustrating in a good way if you like this type of game. Game itself flows well.
B0034G4OYK|5.0|I got this movie to watch with my niece and we both just love it! She really liked the songs in it quite a bit.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|When I first began to Play Doddle God it was because I need both something to stimulate my mind and something that was simple enough to be a distraction from stress. It most certainly helped in those areas.<br /><br />To my pleasant surprise I found it enjoyable and providing a sense of satisfaction.<br /><br />I can recommend Doddle God for all of the above and for fun.  You begin with four tiles and expand through combinations to 288.
B000UX6THK|3.0|This was a very interesting start to a season but left me hanging at the end. And there isn't a follow up to this series, dagnabit!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|If your looking for a game to pass 10 minutes with, then this game is for you. The developer suggest to keep the game to be notified of updates but I will be removing. It is fun with a little bit of thinking involved. Defiantly not for little kids but easy for teens.
B0054N73EY|5.0|RHCP are still a solid band, and even with a new guitarist, they still maintain quality material. They will always be top to me.
0345525558|4.0|Yes, parts of this story were frustrating, and I wanted to slap some sense into Victoria at times, but the last 60 pages (one-fifth) made the read worthwhile. This novel is for every woman who has ever questioned her worth, asked herself whether she is a good enough mother, or wished she could go back on a certain decision she had made earlier in her life. It was quite emotional; I needed a half-dozen tissues to finish the book.
B001NLKWLW|4.0|It caught my attention from the very beginning and didn't let go until the end.  An easy read, great for summer.
B00005J6T1|5.0|I was hesitant as fan to buy Madonna's first album. Not that I didn't think it would be good, just that it wasn't exactly in my taste range. I never was a huge fan of Holiday or Lucky Star, but I said to myself why not buy it, you have all her other albums. I was pleasantly surprised at how much fun it is. Anyone who has ever been a fan of pop would love this album. It's so much fun, without being pushy.<br /><br />It's unedited and simplistic approach is appealing, I just adore it. My favorite song off of it has to be I Know It, but you'll find all the other songs exceptionally endearing. Especially the singles Burning Up and Everybody. As far as the remixes go, if you like remixes you'll like them, if you don't you won't. They're not something I always listen to before I eject the CD.
B000BJS4TO|5.0|lovely piece of non invasive mood music;;good for &#34;what ails ya' or doesn't&#34;..add some new age-Dueter & all is well...there is too much rushing around today & things like this take you to a place of relaxation {meditation} ..put this on with low or no lites & taste of favorite wine & I would call that a perfect evening..better yet if was cold outide-raining or snowing a low flame fireplace going..delivery & quality of product was superb for low cost..
B005WYFLNU|5.0|Big fun for little ones ... especially those that like dress-up  Ballet was a favorite  I would order it or any like product again.  We are always happy with Melissa & Doug.
B000AA4JMU|5.0|have always loved a good-heart warming ;; warm & fuzzy cuddly story...this one has always been a favorite.enjoyed it with my oldest daughter in theatre years ! ago & the other daughters & gran daughters since..Mark Lester was such a cute kid & played the part perfectly.Amazing how all the actors parts are so perfectly cast & played. Should be required viewing {after reading the book} of all kids.I don't think you can beat the classics especially of Dickens.Quality of product & protective rapid shipping set this off in a great manner.p
B00CEJ2H6K|3.0|Amon Amarth are incredible. However, Deciever is much less memorable than than their last three albums. I think Oden on Our Side, Thunder God, and Surtur were prettymuch classics start to finish. Deciever has an amazing opening trio of songs plus \\"Coming of the Tide\\". The rest seem kind of bland. I would describe Deciever as heavier and a bit more melancholic than normal. But it dissapoints in providing that triumphant/epic feel that made \\"Live Without Regrets\\", \\"God's of War Arise\\", \\"Tattered Banners and Bloody Flags\\", etc. such completely unforgettable tracks. If you love quality melodic death metal Buy AA's previous three works before considering this one.
B004SUDQ72|4.0|As someone who knows several gamers I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  The plot has enough gamer twists and turns to keep you interested in what's coming next.  I really wanted to give it 5 stars but the acting of everyone involved felt like they could have stepped it up a notch.  The varying levels in the story more than make up for it though.  It was a very creative storyline that reminded me of a Mobius Loop.<br /><br />Be forewarned if dissecting frogs in HS science class turned your stomach, this probably isn't the movie for you because there are some great \\"organic\\" special effects.  A quintessential David Cronenberg film, a writer/director who is a bit of an acquired taste.  I didn't equate it to The Matrix at all but I can see how some would.<br /><br />Thanks to the reviewer who said to avoid the Blu-ray.  I did and was happy with the 1.85:1 widescreen format DVD.  It was a solid sharp digital transfer.  The Miramax disc I purchased had absolutely no special features at all, just the movie, but I picked it up used here on Amazon for less than a buck plus the cost of shipping.<br /><br />If you enjoy intelligent films that express familiar themes in a creative manner, eXistenZ will satisfy you.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|if you want a challenge or just want to waste time this is def the game for you. Both enjoyable and sometimes frustratingly fun, you can't go wrong.
1451648537|5.0|I have read hundreds of biographies over the years and this is by far the best book I have ever read. Once started, I could not put the book down. Thought I knew the man a bit but came away completely understanding what a complex man he was. This book pulls no punches and really allowed me to see all of Jobs brilliance as well as his shortcomings.  Since the latter part of the book deals with so many recent events, found it very helpful to watch videos on youtube after reading each section. For example, the chapter on the iphone unveiling. It was so powerful to read that chapter, then go to youtube and watch his presentation that very day.  This book is a real life changer!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|My 10 year-old would give it 5 stars but I don't play, so that is why it got 4 stars. It keeps him entertained, so it was worth the download time.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|Anyone who has seen the Making of Night Visions will see this was an experiment, a work in progress, blah-blah-blah. I don't care if these guys are one-hit wonders. They already have 2 hits under their belts which is why my daughter finally hounded me enough to buy the CD for her. And good for me, because I winded up falling in love with it, too. Yea, it borrows from bands like Foster the People and the Killers but that's what I like most about it. It's an interesting mix of stuff. When I hear On Top of the World it reminds me of Rusted Root. Distortion this, too much bass that, that's just overanalytical b.s. from sanctimonious Debbie downers. Why listen to them anyway? They're listening to crap no one else cares about. Anyone can listen to the samples and decide if this is a record worth ordering or downloading. I didn't even do that. I took a chance. And this has been one of the best purchases of the year. Enjoy. Can't wait to see what these guys come up with next.
1781162646|1.0|I used to look forward to every King novel but I have not enjoyed reading his work lately.  On impulse I bought Joyland because it was reasonably priced and the ratings were pretty high.  The storyline was okay, nothing special.  I was more than halfway through before it became mildly interesting.  It was not a long book so I continued reading it.  Then on page 279 for no reason he goes on a rant about his hatred for Dick Cheney.  It added nothing to the story.  It was just a mean-spirited diatribe against someone he disagrees with.  He wishes Cheney was dead and some friends of his were still alive?  I don't agree with Joe Biden but I would never wish him dead.  This book is going in the trash have a good life Stephen.
B0063M22QO|3.0|Mahjong is a fun game.  Unfortunately with this app, you don't have the choice of different symbols.  Although you do have different boards.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I've read this book several times and still find myself laughing, crying, holding my breath in anticipation. If you read the first book and loved it, you'll love this book for sure. This is my favorite of all three books!
B003P2WO5E|5.0|This is a great book.  I only wish that I could buy the next book immediately.  Excellent character development!  The magic system is an interesting twist on more conventional systems, and I'm looking forward to seeing how these characters will interact in the next novel.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|if you've been following Downton Abbey with Ms. Maggie you will love this also.  Although it's not a period piece like DA it is just as enjoyable too bad retirement homes in the U.S. don't look like this one, I'd be there in a heartbeat...it's sentimental but with a sense of humor.
1781162646|5.0|A very good, enjoyable summer book.  Unlike many of King's works, it was not overly dark or scary--much more like a crime fiction work in the genre he set out to capture.  I found myself sad to see the story end as it conjured up memories of summers of my youth.
0061733199|5.0|You should, basic survival skills are a must. The more you know the less you need! You can't replace experience, but don't ignore the general knowledge of self preservation. It's the first step.
B00C1N9JWO|2.0|I have read most of Ms. Singh's Psy/Changeling series. I have to say Kiss of Snow let me down a lot and the only reason I read Heart of Obsidian is to see how the overarching story evolved. Yeah, I might have skipped some books inbetween, but honestly I don't feel like I missed much. And I am genuinely surprised so many people gave this book 5 stars.<br /><br />Here is my honest, sincere review for this book: I love how the big story of the evolution of Psy and their Silence turned out. I couldn't really care less about Kaleb and Sahara. Roughly 90% of the book was blah blah every other page (if not every page) about how dark and cold Kaleb was, the most beautiful, dangerous possessive person alive, but it's perfectly okay because Sahara loves him and she is his and he is hers. She was broken, but she became stronger because of it... Which is all nice to hear once or twice, but this was literally repeated every time they were together, which was constantly. What I got from this part of the book (the 90%) was a series of buzz words and artificial hooks meant to be suspenseful (like what WAS Sahara's power, and what Kaleb REALLY did to her) but instead it got on my nerves and annoyed the crap out of me.<br /><br />The plot was so completely lost in the lovey dovey codependant support system they had going on that when something big actually did happen, I didn't even notice. It was barely a blip for all the reaction it got from the two and yeah, I get that Kaleb is Silent, but I just feel it could have been done a lot better. At least half of the content of this book was fluff and could have easily been cut out by a capable editor to bring this story up to what it should be.<br /><br />In the last 5-6 chapters was when things FINALLY picked up (but why did it have to take so long??) and I adored the element of danger and the memories Sahara unearthed for herself and Kaleb. But, again, the biggest threat in the station fizzled without any bang whatsoever. It was somewhat anticlimactic. I never felt like anyone was really in danger, which completely lost the drive for me. We're talking about the defining events which will literally change the course of Psy history. The build-up in this book just wasn't there, which meant what it was building up to kind of fell flat.<br /><br />I skimmed the last couple of chapters and the only thing I really liked was the talk Kaleb had with the Arrows and the announcement he made to the PsyNet. Two pages to show the shock rippling through the world and then the end. I gotta say, this book has a mighty high price tag for offering so little. All the raw visceral pain and emotion Ms Singh showed in the final memory she uncovered should have been present throughout the ENTIRE book (even with Kaleb so fiercely Silent, it still could have been done, it just wasn't which I think is why it dragged so much. Kaleb and Sahara as kids had worlds more appeal than Kaleb and Sahara all grown up, and I skipped most of the sex scenes because I just wasn't interested). When I read those memories and especially that final one I thought THIS is the Nalini Singh I know and love. But unfortunately that little flash of genius just wasn't enough to make up for an awful lot of mediocre story telling in the rest of the book.
1616550414|5.0|wow, all zelda fans should have this master piece it has tons of art and concepts designs for characters, they have a very talented creative team!.<br />I'm not kidding with it having a lot of pictures, if you are not a fan of zelda but instead you're into art, drawing, graphic design, etc; then the contents of this book will inspire you.<br />Also the story line is neat, it will open your eyes to some aspects of the franchise you never thought about.<br />Seriously, buy it!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I have seen the movie and I have it, it is sad but I like the movie it is great and I hope the game is great like the movie I just hope and I have seen a fish like nemo is so cute and colorfull like a rainbow he is so cute the end
0316247545|5.0|if you know a lot about this show then you are not missing that much, only the introduction by the producers and the interview with Lauren Faust along side with some nice sketches would be the only thing new about this, or if you are a MLP collector this is a piece that you must have no matter what.
B00BY8DNK6|5.0|All the hits, all the magic, all the mystery and in my hometown!!!!!!!! The new generation doesn't know what showmanship is all about. Dio was a master of the live show and this album showcases all that was glorious about the metal scene in 1986.

B005974CNA|4.0|An understandably lot of anxiety and anticipation surrounded the release of Dream Theater's eleventh studio long-player, 2011's \\"A Dramatic Turn Of Events,\\" because it found the founding member/creative songwriter Mike Portnoy bowing out of the fold, and being replaced by veteran metal drummer Mike Mangini (who is perhaps best known for his work with Steve Vai and Canadian thrashers Annihilator). But fear not -- Mangini is every bit the able and technical skinsman that Portnoy was.  As a result, not much has changed in the world of Dream Theater, as their progressive metal/music sound remains as unbridled and intricate as it ever was.<br /><br />\\"A Dramatic Turn  Of Events\\" has a total playing time of almost eighty-minutes, thus making it a terrifically epic and expansive affair, and one that is even more proggy than the band's last release, 2009's amazing \\"Black Clouds And Silver Linings.\\" In fact, \\"Dramatic\\" just might be D.T.'s most progressive piece of music to date. And when considering the competition that it is up against (in the rest of the band's discography), that is REALLY saying something. And with its playing time that is, again, well over an hour long, it is a totally inaccessible affair, and one that is as epic as it is unpredictable.<br /><br />Consider, for example, \\"On The Backs Of Angels\\" the album's lead single, which is eight minutes and forty-two seconds long, for crying out loud! A docile string arrangement introduces it, followed by some dreamy melodic guitar leads. And this melodic section, which is complete with choral-esque backing vocals and colorful keyboard flourishes, eventually morphs into a heavier section with simple-yet-effective guitar riffs (that are crunchy and hefty), lurching rhythms, and noteworthy, technical bass lines. Some triumphantly soaring and fluidly clean melodic guitar soloing sporadically pops its head-up from time to time in this song, too. And it concludes with a beautiful, classical-music-derived piano break. But \\"On The Backs Of Angels\\" is also of note from a lyrical standpoint, as lines like \\"to the slaughter\\" will make you want to look up the lyrics and discern for sure what they are about. (For the record, they address killing and war.) The immediately succeeding \\"Build Me Up Break Me Down,\\" however, possesses choruses that are big enough and have catchy and memorable enough vocals to make it worthy of being \\"Dramatic\\"'s lead single. It kicks off with surprisingly heavy, fiery, deeply grooving riffs and up-tempo, if not quite thrashy, pacing, and also features some eerie synth touches, thus adding some added ambiance to the mix. And this number, which wraps up with a pretty symphonic outro, is considerably shorter than \\"Backs,\\" too, thus furthering its shoulda-been lead single potential.<br /><br />Next comes \\"Lost Not Forgotten,\\" a track introduced by a beautiful piano solo, followed by some Cynic-esque, jazzy, and at times almost new-wavy-sounding melodic guitar soloing and sweep picking laid over a bed of bottom-heavy, crunching power chords, grumbling bass notes, and some sound double bass thumping (this is the album's only spot of double bass drumming!). This really complex and math-y number features extended instrumental breaks (including the first three minutes of the song), and more arrangement and tempo change-ups than you probably will know what to do with. And it tacks on a bit of deliciously epic, mazy, ripping, and wailing, Yngwie Malmsteen-influenced melodic guitar solo section, too, thus helping to further its status as being a towering, epically epic, ten-plus minute long opus. But again, Dream Theater immediately offset it with another more accessible song in \\"This Is The Life,\\" a seven-minute long follow-up piece of bloated, soaring, dreamy, sweetly-sung prog-rock power balladry with as many keyboards as guitars (although it does feature a somber string arrangement, too, though).<br /><br />But back on the epic side of the line, again, \\"Bridges In TheSky\\" is an eleven-plus minute long epic that utilizes (what sounds like) a full orchestra in its terrifically trippy and drawn-out intro. This, then, abruptly flows into a surprisingly aggressive and up-tempo section with chunky, chugga-chugga riffs, thus creating an amazing sense of dynamic and contrast. The vocals remain cleanly-sung, throughout, though, and some added ear-candy is included from the tune's use of choral-sounding backing vocals. \\"Bridges...\\" is also further highlighted by some deftly funky, slapped bass lines, impressive, polyrhythmic drumming, and a totally air-guitar-able bit of very ripping, wah-wah-inflected guitar soloing. And, subsequently, track number six, \\"Outcry,\\" is an even longer epic. It has an ethereal keyboard intro that gives way to aggressive, and almost Meshuggah-like angular riffing. And this, then, flows into an epic bit of twiddly, lengthy, and winding bit of guitar and keyboard soloing. And this number, which is anchored by a solid, grumbling bass bottom, has another extended, drawn-out instrumental section, one that would not be complete without some technical bass soloing, to boot! The vocals eventually come back into the mix, but they are always of the consistently warm crooning variety.<br /><br />Both \\"Far From Heaven\\" and the acoustic guitar-laden album closer, \\"Beneath The Surface\\" (which has touching vocals, lyrics, and sky-scraping harmonies), are two other pieces of soulful, touching, heart-on-a-plate, piano-based power balladry, and each are as tender as a prime cut of veal. But sandwiched between them is \\"Breaking All Illusions\\" a song that easily overshadows both ballads, as it is the album's possible highpoint and pinnacle. Clocking in at nearly 12.5 minutes in length, the track finds D.T.'s rhythm section being fleshed-out to the center-stage, as it features some noteworthy, dexterous, tribal-beat-sounding percussion and technical, beeping, galloping bass lines. This part is then followed by excellent clean singing that would make Opeth's Mikael Akerfeldt proud. And later on, the song delves into a really math-y and tech-y part where piano and keyboard solos trade-off with tricky guitar and bass picking. Suffice it to say, this epic boasts a terrifically complex and lengthy instrumental mid-section, and still more tasty and memorably jazzy melodic guitar solo flights, as well as a proggy spider-web of gorgeous sweep picking.<br /><br />Yes, \\"A Dramatic Turn Of Events\\" is a bit of a horse-pill of an album, thus making it rather difficult to swallow and even harder to digest. (What else could be used to describe the fact that it has an average, over-the-top playing time of almost nine minutes per song?!) And plus, the record, while heavy in parts, seemingly almost never switches moods or gears. As a result, it pretty much plays like one, long, drawn-out song, from beginning to end. But whereas this fact might make some listeners afraid of an album like this, this reviewer opts to believe that it just makes it that much more epic. And besides, there is more-than-enough brilliant songwriting and musicianship/instrumental prowess present, here, to satisfy all Dream Theater fans (both old and new). Hence, \\"Dramatic,\\" a record that, like all great prog-metal records, reveals itself more and more with each and every listen, might not be a flawless affair, but it easily warrants receiving a whole-hearted recommendation from yours truly.Sky\\" is an eleven-plus minute long epic that utilizes (what sounds like) a full orchestra in its terrifically trippy and drawn-out intro.

B00D37UQ1K|1.0|This was clearly a failed attempt by a greedy writer who felt the need to make more money.<br />What a waste to do this film , just terrible.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I started with the HBO series. When season 2 ended, I wanted to get inside the characters' heads and pick more on the backstory. It's a great series overall with great character development and lots of diversity in plot direction.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|The title of this show does not do it justice.  I only watched it on someone's recommendation.  It is a great show.  The main character is the wife of a lower level politician.  He is jailed for misconduct and she has to deal with the shame of being his wife, the suspicion of wondering whether he really did it or was set up, and the need to go back to work.  She is a lawyer.  So the show involves court cases just like Law and Order, but also the drama of her everyday life.  Well worth watching.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I picked up the first Ep just to see what all the hubbub was all about at the water cooler. Hooked ever since. Great characters whom you will care about. Lots of backstory and traditions of the different clans that really makes this epic very 3 dimensional. Tip: Just discovered there's a book series on which the HBO series is based.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|This game requires good attention to detail and good problem solving abilities. It took me a while to get the hang of it, but now I can hardly put it down.
B00DGMVJAO|2.0|The storyline was very predictable. I was hoping for a contemporary twist on the tale, but what they did have just wasn't sufficiently different to hold my interest. So, failing that, I settled in to enjoy my popcorn and revel in the character development and CG.... Well, I at least enjoyed the popcorn.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is so fun the only thing that could be better is to add air and sea vehicles and make special maps for them.
B005LAIGLO|4.0|\\"Contraband\\" follows the story of a former world-class smuggler Chris Farraday (Mark Wahlberg), now a father of two children and happily married to Kate (Kate Beckinsale). When his brother-in-law failed to deliver the goods to a sadistic drug dealer Briggs (Giovanni Ribisi), Chris is forced to do one last job: smuggling counterfeit $100 bills from Panama.<br /><br />The action thriller looks a bit like a throwback to an old-fashioned heist movie, though \\"Contraband\\" is actually a remake of 2008 Icelandic film \\"Reykjavík-Rotterdam\\" starring Baltasar Kormákur, who now directs the new version. The by-the-numbers story of \\"Contraband\\" is filled with stock characters played by typecast actors, but the film is fast-paced and its action sequences are decent.<br /><br />For all its familiarity, \\"Contraband\\" is an entertaining action movie that benefits from slick direction, high production value and effective acting.
075669812X|5.0|Bought this for my 7 and 8 year old boys, they love this book and read it over and over.
0385344228|5.0|This book is a wowzer.  I can't say too much or I'll give it away, but it has a surprise ending and is one of the best books I've read in a long time.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The levels are just challenging enough to be fun without pulling out your hair. Don't start unless you have some free time.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app has so many options and the sound is clear, it is the best I have found. I had been using sleepy time and this is far better as you can mix in just the right sounds.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Story keeps getting deeper and better. Could not stop watching it, so I went through the whole season non-stop. Would recommend this to everyone.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love everything about this book but the ending....it just stops, of course it makes us want more!! All my friends are waiting for the next installment in this series.
B004D2GMR6|1.0|I have been purchasing products from Amazon web page for a while now. But it in this particulary item I was very disappointed. And hope that Amazon con talk to the broker or producer that distribute this particular DVD.<br />I'm a Bon Jovi fan, and before a bought it, read the list of songs in the concert, for my surprise, when I saw it, the las four songs, and one of the most iconics ones, three were on a bonus that did not specify on the DVD : &#34;You give love a bad name&#34;, &#34;runaway&#34;and &#34;Bed of Roses&#34; to see and hear this songs you have to go the bonus menu !!!  But it is the same concert !! is rediculous !! and the other song : &#34;Bad Medecine&#34; you can not see it just hear it because they are finishing the concert and all the info on the producers and all that stuff is passing by...<br />I Hope that the amazon people can get this through the albums, producers...<br /><br />Igor Sterkel
B0010X8NF0|4.0|Having two brothers, I can relate to the family interaction.  The film seemed off-balance several times (as are families) but overall I enjoyed some of the craziness and the dry comedy.  I also liked the trip to India and learning to appreciate another country and culture.  Overall, worth a looksee.
B00005JPD0|5.0|great movie
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I liked this because it had a lot of info on Greek, Roman and Egyptian gods.I recommend this book to anyone
B004QBWU02|5.0|great movie
B00A8ZZ2Z0|5.0|This is the first Helloween music I have bought in a long time and I couldn't be happier! I love this cd and it gets played all the time. Several people at work that have heard me playing also went out and bought it.
B006CHML4I|5.0|I really dig this watch. I like the blue face and the white hands are easy to read. I purchased this one because I wanted a low cost quality self-winder and that's what I got. The canvas strap is nice too though I may change that out for an expandable metal strap.
B001BANK32|4.0|I liked it a lot.  It was a great quick read that keeps you on the edge of your seat!
B004JZBGWI|4.0|Great for taking notes/making lists on the go with my Kindle. Used to have this app on my droid phone - great uses!
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|I am not a big reader but this book kept me glued to the pages every time I open it.  I would reccomend this book to anyone who can read!
B00AEFY66U|5.0|My son was married in this mansion (Rose Cliff) It is beautiful, and I love this edition of &#34;the Great Gatsby&#34;  I did not like the new one at all.
B00A85EMVK|2.0|The DVD and Blu-Ray versions are fine, nothing spectacular (my Orignal Series Star Trek Blu-Ray quality puts this movie to shame. The Blu-Ray 3D is awful and it isn't due to my HDTV. I also own 3D versions of Avatar, Avengers and Jurassic Park and their quality is excellent. The resolution of the 3D version of Top Gun appears grainy on a 32\\" HDTV, can only imagine what it would look like on a larger screen. Save your money, stick with the DVD or straight Blu-Ray version.
B004LROUNG|5.0|A well put together novel. I read this book in 3 days. I could not put it down. You must read this.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Very impressive read. A great love story.  I hope the author plans to continue the story.  Thank you, E L James
B0089LOKHG|5.0|These books were fantastic! I love the ending as you the reader get to decide what happens after the story ends.
1400069807|4.0|Everyone who wants a healthy life style should read this book!!  It really opens your eyes of what our government is allowing the top food chain names to get a way with and causing our nations obesity problem and the bad health that many people are facing with foods that are being changed in the lab!!
0345803485|1.0|I have to admit I could only bear to read a few pages, and the last couple I was skimming. Juvenile, banal writing, cardboard characters, and a slow moving story. What more could one want?<br />I was heartened to read how scathing some of the reviews are, but this tripe became a best seller?
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|Having worked in IT industry for over a decade as developer and project manager I could relate to almost all the described disasters in this book. Written in the style of Goldratt's \\"Goal\\" the authors force readers to rethink their dogmas over IT and look for the way out.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book on so many levels that rating it below 5 stars is unthinkable. Even despite the clumsy army-hype that made little sense to me.
B00CL0J99K|2.0|I had high hopes for this movie after seeing Iron Man, Iron Man 2 and The Avengers. What a let down. There was no Tony Stark in the Iron Man suit action...War Machine never fired a round. Then Pepper gets infected and becomes a martial arts expert??? I could go on, but I've said enough. Save your money.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game its so addicting not too easy not too hard its perfect for just passing the time its really fifferent than most other escape games i highly recomend this game to everyone its my favorite
B008OM0EDO|1.0|I can see how on paper this might have sounded funny, but the film really only gets two or three chuckles and then keeps going to its obvious and poorly written end.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Bruno is my new favorite. Love, love, love him. The cd is bit racy, but he has a fantastic voice. I have listened to it over and over. And over.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|It was a nice game but a little hard to have fun playing it. I liked it but it could of been mire you know fun
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Never troubled I love it!!! I'm goin to tell everyone how great it is! Haha LOL. I luv the unicorns
B002N44XSG|5.0|A nice bunch of exciting stories of Percy Jackson and his friends! Really Good book! I definitely recommend to people who are fans of Percy Jackson
B00CUWWLWG|3.0|Fun &amp; addictive, but takes too long to earn / build the more you advance unless you spend money.  Also don't like being attacked without knowing.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|The gameplay is good.  Keep trying to connect to Facebook and getting told connection cannot be completed.  I do like that you don't have to buy credits
0061547840|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  There were a lot of useful nuggets on information that I thought were interesting and worthy of further elaboration.  The first few chapters were the strongest.<br /><br />However, there are several drawbacks:<br />1. Complaining about other people.  Donald spends considerable time talking about other celebrities and complaining about ones he didn't like, the ones he fought with etc etc.  This gets boring.<br />2. Bragging.  More and more which gets tiresome over several chapters.<br />3. Complaining about losing money.  He complains the most about losing money in divorces and has a chapter devoted to getting a pre-nup (yes,really).<br /><br />Be aware that if you find Donald's personality grating to begin with, this book is unlikely to convert you to be a fan.  If you can overlook that, then it's a worthy read.
B00785P2QC|3.0|To get anywhere in this game you will probably need to spend money on it. The credits aren't cheap either...there isn't even a .99 option.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I had to buy another of their music and share with<br />other members of our family. Their music is really<br />relaxing.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I enjoyed this game a lot.  Puzzles were hard enough for a bit of a challenge but not frustratingly difficult.  A few minor annoyances but nothing major.  Graphics were beautiful.  Price was a little more than I'm used to paying for this type of game _ they really do rope you in with the initial &quot;free<br />&quot; game.  All in all it was wrung game.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|a very challenging game. a game forcing me to think outside of the box. I highly recommend for any one looking for a challenge
B006N0YWGY|3.0|but after finishing the first 10 runs, I found no incentive to play again. No leaderboard, not even for my own game. It's as if I never played.  Nothing new opened up. No new map, nothing. Also, would be nice if there is a multiplayer mode as well.
B00C061I3K|3.0|If you want to relax...here ya go mister...this CD will calm you right down...<br />It maybe to melow for true Daft Punk fans...
B0059WTMLW|5.0|This game eliminates any complaints about the game of sudoku that you could have. Except for I don't know how to count. There is an awesome number of puzzles with more skill levels than any game I have found anywhere. If you like sudoku, you want to learn sudoku, or you want to improve your skills this is the game. Worth the price.
B0002KZAKS|5.0|Can't really go wrong with this one.  My son's been using it for about a year now and it's rock-solid.
0307341550|5.0|I started reading Gillian Flynn with Gone Girl and because of how much I loved that book, I really wanted to read her other works.<br /><br />Camille Preaker is the narrator of Sharp Objects and she is a mess of a character. Years ago, she fled her hometown, Wind Gap, and she now lives in Chicago as a mediocre reporter for the fourth largest paper in the city.<br /><br />Last year, a teenage girl was murdered in Wind Gap. When the story starts, another teen girl has disappeared. Camille's editor suggests she go back to her hometown to report on the possibility of a connection between the murder and the current disappearance.<br /><br />Reluctantly, Camille returns. Her relationship with her mother is bizarre (she needs lots of alcohol in her to be able to even call home) and she quickly runs into old high school mates. Avoiding people she knows would be impossible in Wind Gap with its population of 2000 residents and the bitchy gossip that comes with everyone knowing everyone else.<br /><br />Camille's visit is overshadowed by the death of her own sister many years earlier and there is a strong undercurrent of violence to this story. Hunting and the slaughter of animals is as normal as the definite pecking order in Wind Gap social circles.<br /><br />This story is deeply unsettling and Gillian Flynn is a genius of building tension in a story. Sharp Objects will make your skin crawl and it will keep you guessing until the very last page. Ms. Flynn's imagery is wicked and you will be drawn into this story that is stuffed with meanness, cliques and disturbed characters.<br /><br />Sharp Objects will stay with you long after you've finished it. I can't wait to see how else Gillian Flynn will redefine the crime/thriller genre.
B0053Q9DHW|1.0|I have seen a number of Jane Eyre versions, so I knew the storyline going into this new rendition.  However, this version was boring, and confusing with the constant flashbacks.  I also didn't feel the love or angst between the two main characters.  The ending of the movie happens way too fast. We do not see the fire, only the remains/effects, and consequently his blindness.  The final scene was unmoving, and did not show them getting married, or regaining some sight.  I was even somewhat confused when she came upon him, it was not mentioned that he was blind, I guess we were supposed to figure that out on our own, or by noticing the direction in which his eyes were, or were not staring.  It was just an overall poor adaptation.
B00DF0POXA|2.0|My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was probably one of the best albums I have ever heard...from ANY artist. Coming off of a hiatus plus that, I guess I just had higher expectations. It's not horrible but it's not Kanye or hip-hop (much less the future of hip-hop). I know his style is evolving but this seems like a devolution.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This online Bible is comprehensive w/multiple versions and audio capability. The Bible plans and links (Facebook, etc) make it easy to interact w/friends and social networks. Bookmarks and highlights help customize the Bible of choice and make reading very personal. The You Version Bible can be downloaded on various devices. That increases the number of options for Bible reading experiences which is excellent!
B009KS4XRO|1.0|It is a shame that the people behind bingo blitz have decided to make a fun game frustrating and unwinable.  Every room has 12 items that you have to collect.  Great concept except that 1 or 2 of the items are virtually impossible to get.<br /><br />They want you to purchase credits from them, but you would have better odds hitting it big in Vegas than using those credits to win the items.<br /><br />Very discouraging to play.  Please pick another game that is more fair to play.  Don't waste your time or money.
B009HXGD4S|4.0|A good well made movie with a great cast about a romantic young couple in love. Never really gets exciting but has a nice constant enjoyable pace to it.
B009P13RQY|5.0|Following on their terrific release, &#34;Warp Riders,&#34; The Sword come extremely close to topping themselves with &#34;Apocryphon.&#34;  This album is classic Black Sabbath-type metal through and through.  Like most albums from The Sword, this one is a little top-heavy with the two best songs at the very front of the track listing.  However, listeners are definitely rewarded by listening all the way through.  With 4 great albums now under their belt, it's amazing to me that this band isn't more popular.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|I find it a lot of fun. Seems time Flies by when I am on it. I will defiantly continue playing.
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|While I admittedly only became a QOTSA fan with their &#34;Songs for the Deaf&#34; release, I quickly dove into their back catalog and realized what I had been missing.  Their follow ups to &#34;Songs for the Deaf,&#34; while solid, were a bit inconsistent and dragged in a few places.  Not so with &#34;...Like Clockwork.&#34;  This album simply ROCKS and is their best since their under-appreciated debut.  Some of my favorites include the slow-burn opener &#34;Keep Your Eyes Peeled,&#34; the hard rocking pair &#34;If I Had A Tail&#34; and &#34;My God is the Sun,&#34; and the latest single &#34;Fairweather Friends.&#34;  Honestly, though, you can't go wrong with any song on the album.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's the best game!!!! It to easy to play<br />!!! So much fun to play! My sister and i play it all the time!!!!
B007JCP8FE|5.0|Following on what I consider their breakthrough album &#34;The Sound of Madness,&#34; this latest album had bid shoes to fill.  I'm here to say that &#34;Amaryllis&#34; not only filled those shoes, but has set the bar even higher.  While there may not be a cross over hit as big as &#34;Second Chance&#34; on this album and it's certainly not as heavy as their earlier efforts, &#34;Amaryllis&#34; is a great rock album through and through. From the harder rocking hits &#34;Adrenaline&#34; and &#34;Enemies&#34; to the softer touches of &#34;Unity&#34; and &#34;I'll Follow You,&#34; you can't miss with any song on this album.  I can't wait to see what this band does next.
B00CFOGCAG|5.0|At first I thought cool a retro platforms but I was Wrong best. This is by far my favorite app on the store because of the intense boss fights and wide variety of enemies this game is amazing. The customize options allow an astonishing look to your character which can be both male or female you can also ride dinosaurs and go back in time. If your a parent this game is great for kids no blood or immature content it's pure fun and deserves a 4-5 star rating!!!
0425263924|4.0|As good as the frist book of the set of three. Looking forward to more of the story . A forth book would realy finish the lives of Eva and Gidian.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game!!!! I can be stuck on it for hours!!!!!<br />It is such a challenge to try an get all of the prizes. And funky outfits boards etc. And the updates just keep getting better!!!
0385338910|5.0|When I read a book, the part I enjoy the most is good dialogue (I dislike detailed descriptions of scenery, faces, etc.).  This book probably has the best dialogue of any book I have ever read:  the dialogue was very Seinfeld-like.  Besides the great and humorous dialogue, I also really enjoyed each of the characters and I liked how the book presented some very emotional moments as well.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I could play this game all day long. It is excellent for excitement and lots of  coins and powerups to catch! Don't forget that the grumpy inspector and his dog are waiting to catch you!:):)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love to take care of my horse! This game is so realistic its almost like I'm taking care of horses! I haven't been fond of horses lately but this made me fall in love with them!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like puzzles and hidden object games. This got good reviews, so i tried it. Glad i did. Hope more rooms get added soon.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This was a great book. It's a fast read, but really allows you to connect with the characters. I was cheering at the end.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I am glad my wife downloaded this game on my Kindle Fire.  It is a lot of fun to play, and I like that they change up the scenery every 4 weeks.  I love the pace of the game and the different goals they give you, as well as the missions.  The different characters are cool, too.<br /><br />I have one complaint and one suggestion that keep it from getting 5 stars.  My complaint, and this is specific to the Kindle Fire version, is that the updates do not go through right away.  They are always a day late at least,  and once they were 6 days late.  That gave me only a day to complete the weekly challenge.  Hopefully they fix that.  I think that might be an Amazon issue, not a game issue.<br /><br />My suggestion would be to give each character a certain advantage over the other ones, so that they are all different.  Right now they just look different, but all do the same thing.  For example, you could make one character who carries the magnet 10% longer.  One who has the star last longer.  Just change them up a bit.  This would give people incentive to change characters, use them for different missions.<br /><br />I hope Kiloo comes out with more games like this.  This one is a winner.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun easy awesome amazing and great for young kids and even adults it's so much better than temple run our angry gran run its awesome you score high and it actually really hard part this game!!!
B0083ZBW2Y|1.0|This short novel creates essentially a fantasy story about the dog Buck...his reversion back to the wild does not seem plausible and  Bucks racial memories about the &#34;hairy&#34; man creature that his ancestors bonded with is simple fantasy.  But it is an interesting story and offers some insight to the gold rush in the Yukon many years ago. While the plausibility of the story is doubtful everyone should appreciate Londen's mastery of setting, character development and imagery. For aspiring writers it is a valuable text book on &#34;how to&#34;.
B00992CF6W|3.0|l think that this is a starter on minecraft  i got this and still have lots of fun olsow it takes longer to update than others do .
B004LWZWGA|3.0|Bale is the best \\"Batman\\" by far. I love the darkness of this Batman.<br /><br />Bane is a huge disappointment. He is almost impossible to understand. I must have missed why he wears the silly mask. The movie did not, in my opinion, make it clear.<br /><br />The \\"cat\\" burgler makes for great eye candy, but is a little over the top regarding her \\"powers\\". Not believable.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game to force you to slow down and think logically. Very entertaining if app you don't mind frustration for a bit.
B00B22IJXK|5.0|I am having a great time using this Paint Infinity app - never thought of myself as at all creative until now.
030789701X|5.0|The book is full of beautifully drawn artwork,and gives you the low down on everything Skyrim.<br />It gives guides on all types of builds, races, crafting, maps, and enemies.<br />Find out how you need to build your own home, learn all the secrets of Skyrim, all in one book.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I always enjoy books by Jeffrey Archer.  I loved the two previous books in this series, but hated waiting for this one to be published after the 2nd one left you hanging.  From the way this is written I imagine there will be another one in the future.  I hope I will be notified when this happens.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Not what I expected but better. I have no doubt this is what to expect of the human race in a global crisis. That was the most horrifying part! Well written, great format and overall very frightening. I now know there's no way I'd ever survive a zombie apocalypse!!! I don't think I'd want to!!!
B00CATSONE|5.0|This book was not only educational from a historical view, but very inspiring concerning the creative aspect that lays dormant in many of us.  It gives an excellent backgound on Tesla's dedication and the many obstacles he faced as well as his brilliance as an inventor. Very insightful!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I enjoy playing the game it's fun and easy but also a challenge I will tell my family and friends
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Love it... Can not wait to start reading book three....  This is the 2 nd time reading book one and two excellent story. Gideon and Eva won my heart
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|My favorite song on this album is pearl hart I would totally recommend this cd to fans of volbeat. Awesome
B00D6B4PUG|1.0|This is no better than using the browser. There is absolutely no reason to waste your money on this. Very disappointed.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This is one of the best games ever! I have it on my pc and I got to one point to where I had to buy it. But even though I had to buy this it's way better! 5 stars for dis one.
B000683VI4|5.0|I first watched the movie and then because i loved the movie so much decided to read the book too and just like the movie it is a 5 star
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really really fun I love the missions and challenging my self I like the game alot u would have alot of fun
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is sweet.I love it I have i have it on my iPhone and kindle fire it takes a long time to load but am I complaining NO. I recommend it to everyone who love dinosaurs,dragons, and exotect creators of all time!  P.S I got a rainbow dragon on my first try! I love it it's perfect
1594481717|5.0|An informative read, the author is really on the pulse of the business world.  I loved the concept of the conceptual age.
B001FD5KJM|5.0|I really like how this movie is as following the Marvel comics and entertainment. Robert Downey Jr.  did and awesome job as Tony Stark.
1781162646|5.0|This book is vintage Stephen King.- the best compliment I can give it.  If you ever wanted to work at an amusement park or carnival, you will get the feeling of it in this book.  The characters are well drawn and believable, and there is horror at an old amusement park, the kind they had before the huge ones existed.  The carnival world is both appealing and scary, and you will feel like you are in when reading this book.  I was sorry to see it end, and return to the everyday world.
B00285K1EK|3.0|Not really the Marvel franchise, but as a stand alone movie, it is quite entertaining and fun to watch. I would watch it again.
B0089AD8IO|5.0|Okay, we are total Dr Who fans at my house. The first season was great. Christopher Eccleston made a very good first doctor (of the new series). I was disappointed when he was only there for one season, then, of course, I fell in love with David Tennant. Even if you didn't watch the original Dr. Who TV series, you will enjoy this one.
B00AEKFLOQ|5.0|Loved this movie when it came out, I just had to buy the steelbook. It's a long movie but well worth the sore butt. Amazing movie, fast shipping, Thanks!
B00B7VZN76|5.0|This just blew me away. I am a big fan of Star Trek TNG with my startrekparodies.com site, and I was amazed at the sound and great crisp images.  Loved the extras too.  Can't wait till season 4!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Books are far better than the HBO series. Although I like having a face to put with the characters, the books give so many more details. Love them!
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|This show is definitely off the spectrum and is so different from many other dramas in so many ways. It is expertly scripted, acted and the imagery is amazing, each episode has my undivided attention. And yes, it is very very different from the original books and is only based on Hannibal's character so don't expect to see a lot of similarity. All I can say is that it's smart, entertaining and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who can handle this type of show.
B0072OFM28|5.0|This is an amazing show to get into it. Only has a few seasons, but it is definitely worth watching. Very gory, amazing special effects, so you have to have the stomach for it. I would buy this again!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These books were an excellent read I am anticipating a great reenactment of it on the big screen, but so far am not impressed with the movie released. It does not capture the true emotion in the series.
1451696191|4.0|An adult will grow tired of the book quickly.  But tens will love it.  It deals w/ issues about growing up, fitting in and finally coming to a point understanding an accepting your own past.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|easy and affordable game for kindle, player learns technique as game is played, good value for the price.  All levels not available at first, player must earn levels.
B0068THAGY|5.0|This movie was so good.  It scared my daughter and I when we least expected it and we loved it.  It was also nostalgic for me as it had a lot of eighties references. This was a sweet movie about fathers finally connecting with their children with a sci-fi twist thrown in.
0345529057|5.0|These books are great from what I have read.  I loved the show and decided I would treat myself to the books.  The only drawback is that they are on the cheaper side of production.  Just be careful and you should have no issues with them staying together, and even so they are very cheap to replace.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Excellent way to catch up on an epic series from one of the best writers of our time. The cost for the set was the selling point for buying the five book set over purchasing each individually.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Amazing and uplifting. Great for all school kids to read. Excellent fast and simple read that brought tears to my eyes.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|The story continues, parallels could be drawn to the French Revolution and the &#34;let them eat cake&#34; attitude of the privileged few
B00C8985DU|5.0|My favorite McCartney album after Band on the Run and Wings Greatest.  Sound is much better with the new master.  The only disappointment was that none of the bonus tracks are new.  They are all repeats from the original release.
B005EGXTL2|5.0|Like the John Marsden &#34;Tomorrow&#34; series this is so very real and could so easily be what this current society descends to that it is ghoulishly fascinating
B005T87QCI|1.0|It don't work on kindle fire. it was only $1. but its the principal of the whole thing. please fix.
B004S5FW1U|3.0|I found this story frustrating and slow to come to any point the constant focus on American football was annoying and boring
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I'm kind of stunned to see so many negative reviews for this book.  I loved it. I've read all of Lee Child's books and he is one of my \\"gotta-haves\\" whenever he writes a new one. I was riveted by this book from the first page and read it way faster than I wanted or intended because I couldn't wait to see what would happen next.  If it's different from his previous Reachers, I got over it quickly because it was suspenseful and I always admire the way he weaves his intricate plots and (usually) multi-layered characters.  I felt this was no different even if it took a very different approach.<br /><br />This kind of reminds me of one of my other favorite authors, Lawrence Block, and his Random Walk book, which was a huge departure from his Matt Scudder murder mysteries, my favorite series by this incredibly prolific author.  Critics and fans skewered him for it and he kind of retreated but I liked the book, appreciated it for what it was, and admired him for doing what he wanted, not just what fans expected.<br /><br />Reacher as we all know and love him will be back. But meanwhile, I liked this departure, this side trip.  And loved that still, as always, frequently...Reacher said nothing.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its a really fun game. Sometimes I fine myself playing it late at night my baby is asleep. Also trying to beat your old score
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Never has a story effected me the way this book did. I'm so impressed with the heroes of our military. Thank God for those who put their lives on the line so we can live in freedom. God protect them always.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|A very lighthearted movie to make you laugh. Nice to see it brought back I use to watch the old version.
B00AECGQF2|4.0|I Love this game because you get to style hair anyway you want to. And if you want to be a hair stylist this is a great game for you.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|With growing up in my time it is wonderful to be able to share such a strong female role model with my granddaughters
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Good info. Studies and facts are well cited. Fascinating insight on habits. Would recommend this book to anyone interested in the subject.
0385504225|5.0|what can I say when I truly need to lose my self in a book I only have a few I go too this being one
B0041D843M|5.0|This is a very interesting book.  However, all it does is confuse me more.  I can read one book that touts basically all meat and no carbs and they will sell me on it, but then I'll read something like this book that says the opposite, and they sell me on it too, and so I am left wondering which truly is the best way to eat.
160059672X|5.0|I love Sherry Serafini's easy-to-understand directions, how-to's, and projects.  She is a total inspiration to this new to embroidery beader.
B006N0YWGY|5.0|same developer as riptide gp...another awesome game...you are supposed y o run into things when u drive thats how u find hidden things...u touch the tablet left or right to move...u dont move th tablet. ...those people complaining ..did u try that?...<br /><br />im happy this was the free app of the day.. I was so tempted to buy this before....
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Wonderful different adventure everytime you enter the subways wish there were more levels than 30 the game is very addictive
B006GKHE6G|5.0|I got the game of the Google app store.. its Amazing. .. It's one of the best games that I have played in a long time. I highly recommend this game.
0316228532|4.0|Delivered quickly and condition was as described. A bit different from what I was expecting but the characters were well drawn, the plot interesting, and the ending wonderfully predictable - you knew it was coming but denial isn't just a river in Egypt.
B00AMS4H2M|4.0|I'd say that T.I. is one of the best rappers of our generation. However, he does not always deliver. Yet, Trouble Man is another T.I. album that is worth giving a try. The standout track is Sorry which features Andre 3000.He gives you the same bad chicks, I got money, and I used to sell dope lyrics. But it is easy enough to listen to and it takes it back to Trap Musik at times. It's worth a listen or two in my opinion.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|So beautiful and intelligent! Definitely a favorite. It warm my heart, as well as melted it. It has a great message to it that will have you take a second look at life. Great book!
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Love the easy to use controls and the non-stop pace. Tons of different options for your armor keeps it very interesting.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I was talked into reading this book by my 12 year old son. I told him that I wouldn't watch the movie until after I read the book. Needless to say, I delayed to long, and he and my wife wound up seeing the movie together. It wasn't until I saw the preview for Catching Fire while at the movies to see Superman, that my interest was renewed in the saga.<br />Overall, I would highly recommend this book. It was definitely written as a book geared towards teenagers, and there were parts that were just way too far fetched for my liking. I'd say that's it's really hard for me to give a completely objective review given the fact that I know that there was another one coming and knew in advance about the development of the core characters.  Definitely worth the read.
B000E8N690|4.0|I ordered this movie and it came quickly and plays good. Only complaint is that i have to turn my tv up really loud to hear it. I don't have a problem with the volume playing any other movies but this one. Other than that it plays great.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|As author of a recently published book on the evolution of vintage fashions, I ordered the entire 2nd season of Downton Abbey, to see what I had missed: I was not disappointed! The intertwining  lives of aristocrats and their servants was riveting and the actors,completely believable...In fact, it was interesting that they could portray their dramas  without extravagant gestures and histrionics:...simple eye expressions were eloquent...body language revealing....voices,well modulated... The polite, reserved, but emotionally deep national English character that we all know and love, is  well displayed...  Most interesting to me, were the authentically designed and constructed costumes of the early 20th century,This validated a part In my book where I write, &#34;When I watch a film made in England, I am in awe of the meticulous recreation of authentic costumes --The cut, fit workmanship and knowledgeable use of vintage fabrics is a joy to see. This accuacy is possible because they have access to original garments from which to work--.Because of ancestral pride and sense of history original clothes were saved for posteriity&#34;..The costumes in Downton Abbey are remarkable examples of this authenticity. Betty Kreisel Shubert, author/illustrator of Out-of-Style:A Modern Perspective of How, Why and When Vintage Fashions Evolved.
034580404X|5.0|Definitely something different than I'd usually choose, but when you come right down to it, it's just a love story.  Well written and a good read!
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Fun diversion. Just started, but already upgrading vehicle for better performance. can't wait to get other vehicles to try. Great time killer and brain chiller.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini is a master and his artful and sensitive way to weave the delicate aspects of relationships and love and hardships of the lives of his characters reminds me of a rich, colorful and intiricate Afghan or Persian carpet, that creates a piece of art. It is wonderful to observe and always leaves the reader and observer  in awe by all the small details that made this novel as his previous written works, Kite Runner and A Thousand Splende Sons so amazing.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I would have given this game five stars if it wouldn't have reset for a second time in less than a month.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Season 8 is possibly my favorite season yet!  I know some thought it was uneven, but wow, I thought it was excellent - just the right mix of everything.  Were there a few &#34;dud&#34; episodes?  Sure - but that's common in any TV show, and there were fewer duds in this season than there were in others.  And the finale!? Wow - I can't wait for season 9!!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I got lost in this game last night and stayed up an hour past my normal bedtime,<br />which is so not like me. I am not normally a &quot;gamer&quot; either!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is great. It updates the 'world tour' location automatically. It's user-friendly and easy to use. However, sometimes it freezes, but I've been able to fix it. Overall, I highly recommend this game.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|Really epic science fiction, I couldn't put it down. I loved Rendezvous with Rama and I loved this too. Highly recommended!
B005LAIH2M|5.0|The special effects are outstanding with a strong story line..``<br />It is worth the purchace price and you wont be disponited.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved this game. Would like more. Only thing I DIDN'T. LIKE WAS IF I HAD TO STOP GAME I HAD TO DO THAT LEVEL ALL OVER. WHY CAN'T. I PICK UP WHERE I LEFT OFF?
B008X9Z37A|5.0|She uses it all the time and really enjoy's it. Recommend people who purchase a kindle to get it and it will help to protect it.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Excellent value for viewing The Godfather Collection in vivid quality.  Value, Quality and its all together under one roof.<br />Worth the ownership.
B001V7UXG2|2.0|WE were not happy with this series and did not watch very much of it.--we could have done without it.
B006P3HXZG|5.0|Thank you so much for the movie Puss in Boots, is very nice I'm so happy with you because you're the best seller!
0894803123|4.0|I ordered this book when I learned it was what my son-in-law used to make the yummy homemade ice cream he served when we visited this summer.....there's so many great recipes, I don't know which one to try first...just the thing for a long hot summer.
B0090KZDSK|3.0|I am really disappointed with the end of this book. There really is no end at all! It seems as if the author has got tired of writing or has been urged to finish the book for there is nothing to be considered as an end. I have been waiting a whole year to conclude this story and now it seems that I will have to wait for another year. It is unfair for Day's followers!!
B00BIVN82M|4.0|What a great singing voice!  MB is the smoothest singer of our time and I love listening to him.  This album is a series of old songs formerly done by the Rat Pack and others but sung in that Buble style.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|not too hard. not like my usual hidden object games. enjoyed it. not a very long game. played on kindle fire.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Everyone must play this game because it's the best game in the world it's a really good game to play
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing! Totally ADDICTING, I can never put my kindle down when I start playing it:) it works great on the kindle fire too! It barely glitches at all!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I have become utterly addicted to Hungry Shark Evolution&reg; I was actually quite surprised when I found out this game was free, which is a shocker because it has amazing 2D/3D graphics and 1,000,000+ underwater worlds to discover and see. To be honest,  have actually spent 24 hours to 7 day in day out playing this game trying to work my way up to the Great White Shark,  and right now I have just unlocked the tiger shark and 720 emerald gems. Please download and play this game I guarantee you will find your thumbs moving your shark all day the moment you get it. I am opinionated to loving this game and I hope you learn to like it too.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this was a lot of fun to play. I couldn't put it down. wish there was more levels available to play
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was challenging and logical. The graphics and colors were very good. The response on my Nexus 7 tablet was excellent. It would be even better if it saved found items.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|Movie arrived in perfect condition, quickly, in a new wrapper.  The movie was a great price point. The movie was exactly as I had expected it to be.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Leps world rulez!  I love playing platform games and Leps World is one of the best!!!!  Give it a try!  You won't be sorry!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game, challenging without being impossible, keep more games like this coming, ready for more levels. You have to rate after level 10
B00CRVZRUS|5.0|I see this is a region 2 DVD.  In other words it should only work in Japan, Europe, South Africa, and the Middle East, including Egypt.  Region 1 is for North America.  So the question is?  Does it play in North American machines?  I don't see any complaints here; so I'm a little confused.  Thank you.
B008OOYALE|5.0|love being creative and haatching interesting dragons.  keeps you thinking  handling coins, gold, and areas to dvelope  make new friends
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|It works without complication.  What more could you ask?  A power cord that allows you to charge your Kindle battery.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|O adore this game, it has all the addictive qualities of crack. Fun and fast for the most part. I wish I knew what I was doing wrong on the Necroa virus though. Also a tad pricy to unlock everything, like 20 bucks. Overall a great game. Any help would be helpful.
B0045INOCO|5.0|A retelling of a story from the 1890's novel &#34;Heart of Darkness&#34; set in 1960's Vietnam Conflict. Not much wrong with this film. It is long and not for the squemish.
B00AQA94M4|5.0|It took me a few times to get used to listening to this, and overall it's a fantastic album. It's just so different than anything I have heard in a while.<br /><br />This is my 2nd-favorite Avantasia album. This album and The Scarecrow are the only two Avantasia albums that I can listen straight through. The others I tend to pick-and-choose tracks. It's magical and theatrical.<br /><br />Jorn Lande, one of the best co-singers that works with Avantasia, couldn't make it for this album. However, it did give the other singers a chance to shine through, and they did. Every voice sounded fantastic.<br /><br />If Jorn in on the next album, this experience will make it even more awesome. If they manage to get him and someone like Miles Kennedy, then the universe will possibly blow up from the awesomeness
B00942G4UA|5.0|This film had a profound effect on my family and the way we look at food. The depictions of animal cruelty were upsetting to my daughter, but we are grateful for the educational and informational aspect of the documentary.
B002Z8IWMS|5.0|I'm personally not a fan of Steve Jobs, but you can't go wrong with his presentation skills.  They're the real deal, and this book shows you how to present so that you can make the next great presentation.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|This game has satisfied my TCG hunger... but without the T... It is a very enjoyable game with plenty of card deck arrangements to be made. Good times.
B0015AARJI|5.0|I have purchased 3rd party off brand controllers when mine broke that were frustrating and didn't not work. I broke down and finally found this one on sale for half the price of the ridiculous 60 dollar price tag, and its perfect. You just can't go wrong with the original.
B00846REIS|5.0|This was almost just as good as 50 dog!!! If you haven't already read this then download it now!! You won't regret it
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Such a blast to play but can be frustrating at times, reminds me of the older gaming systems of the 80s and 90s.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I dont no how to de upgrade this cuz i cant join realms so i dont want the new  :(update
B00AREIAI8|4.0|very fun if you love horses . its entertaining and you can play forever. I don't like that you cant choose your own horse and the other fields are waaayto expensive to ever get unless you pay
B00CFOGCAG|5.0|If you like Jetpack Joyride you'll love this. And it's on kindle fire now so great .  There's achievements which when accomplished help you progress through the game. The music is nice and perfect for this game definitely recommend getting this.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love how you travel and you go to Miami and new York you can get towers it rules I love it
B007EE564U|5.0|I've read every Vince Flynn book. The counter intelligence stories featuring Mitch Rapp are my favourites.  The plots are so believable, the research amazing and the character Rapp is so strong.  I'm going to miss Flynn's books so much and all his fans will echo my sentiment, I'm certain.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I can access my notes wherever I am, whether on kindle or computer - very helpful since I don't always have my kindle and sometimes use public computers or my own.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|Overall, this continues the great growth the series is known for. And while the sealed deck format is an awesome addition to the game, it's vastly flawed. You're limited to two save slots, and they can't be erased. More slots are available... for $2 each. Microtransactions, ruining things up as per usual. But if you can look past that, the game is a blast.
B000IZ7YMY|4.0|Amazon needs to fix the problem with needing to &#34;re-load&#34; multiple times through out the rented movie.  Movie was excellent!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Playful and consumable like junk food I couldn't put it down. Interesting look at a Dom/sub relationship unfolding. Perfect amount of sex.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I only wish it could have lasted longer, but this was very fun and satisfying for a free game. I highly recommend it to people who enjoy puzzle games.
B00005UWMX|1.0|I searched out this DVD and was quite anxious to receive it only to find that I could not view it. It seems that I mistakenly ordered the Region 2 product instead of the Region 1. I paid $19.00 for something that I cannot view. The seller did not offer an exceptable alternative, as far as I'm concerned. I will be more careful not to order from sellers who are not in the USA!! This is one of my favorite movies of all time and I really wanted to have. Bummer!!
B007VDN1PA|2.0|I purchsed this scanner because my Epson V500 is too slow to handle the large number of slides I need to convert. This scanner does scan fast but the pictures are not sharp, probably out of focus. The defect is so severe that this scanner is useless for me. I have returned it and will have to put up with the 3.5 min scanning time for 4 slides of my V500.  Very disappointed.
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|This was a great story and an excellent movie for the kids. But don't count on &#34;Shrek-like&#34; humor that has jokes for all ages. It's primarily just a good kids story. Still deserves 4 stars.
0743290933|5.0|The best book of its kind I have ever read. I recommend it to any author who wants to improve the quality of his/her prose and avoid the small mistakes that loom large in a publisher's mind.
B007JZGIMS|4.0|The first time I loaded the Unlocker, it caused the Rocket Player to remain silent no matter what I did.  Uninstalled and re installed the Unlocker (Kindle Fire) and the Rocket Player works as intended.  Opens up some nice extras.  Worth it if it installs correctly.
1476734941|2.0|Got duped by a TV show.  Saw this author tout his diet on a TV show and ordered the book.  Then I found a Scientific American article dashing my hopes.  Now I have a book to sell.  LOL
B003F3NDP8|5.0|Fast delivery and came brand new! This is one of the best seasons of this show, if you have not seen it you need to. Thanks for my purchase.
B005J9ZFQG|5.0|This movie is one of the best B-Movies ever. Really funny, and very entertaining. Bruce Campbell is so great, I just love him!

B004GJIL34|5.0|I'm not going to lie. McQueen's films are hard to watch. They're not supposed to be cookie cutter blockbuster hits. They're supposed to make you think. And think hard. A feat some of the human race has quite a difficult time achieving. Fassbender was great in his role and the direction (not that there was much, as a lot of it seemed very organic) was fantastic. If you're not used to this kind of film, start out with Shame. Although that may be too much as well. At least there's not much physical brutality *shrugs*. I'm absolutely looking forward to 12 Years A Slave. And I just wanted to add that I love how McQueen and Fassbender are obviously bromies and I wish them all the success!

8172238479|4.0|White Tiger (Mann Booker Prize Winner) is an epistolary story related in letters from an Indian entrepreneur, Balram Halwai, to the Chinese prime minister, prior to his visit to India. Balram's name, age and date of birth were bestowed upon him by his schoolmaster, without aid of any documentation. The notes Balram sends are written in the wee hours of the morning. He runs a fleet of chauffeurs that carry Indian workers to and from jobs that are outsourced from the U.S. Since his clients do American jobs, they must keep American hours, so Balram's days and nights are reversed.<br />His letters describe his rise through Indian society, from abject poverty to his current place as a wealthy entrepreneur, that is to say, his escape from the rooster coop of poverty on his way to becoming a White Tiger.<br />The reader is provided a long, disheartening look at the two extremes of Indian society; the great majority of citizens in this populous nation (over one billion strong) live in dire poverty, while only a few (the fortunate one percent) live the good life, all at the expense of the masses beneath them. This situation is certainly not unique to India. One can easily find such sharp divides--rich and poor--in any number of nations around the globe.<br />Balram's rise is a bit more daunting because of the rigid caste system that dominates Indian society. To see his future, he only has to look at his father, a stick of a man who pulls rickshaws, and always will. Balram is also locked in by the expectations of his family. His grandmother, Kusum, demands that he send his wages back to her, and her demands carry the weight of social law. Any son who doesn't comply becomes an outcast and brings shame upon the family.<br />So, to achieve his goals, Balram must battle on two fronts. He succeeds by murdering his boss, and then hides in plain sight. In one humorous incident, a man sees Balram's likeness on a wanted poster, but can't read the text that follows. Balram concocts a ludicrous story, giving himself great credit for the poster, and goes on about his business.<br />White Tiger is apparently a debut novel, and is quite well written for an initial effort. Even though the main character is somewhat less than admirable, the story line is entertaining and makes for a lively read.udicrous story, giving himself great credit for the poster, and goes on about his business.<br />White Tiger is apparently a debut novel, and is quite well written for an initial effort.

0142000655|5.0|East of Eden<br />John Steinbeck<br /><br />If you google cigarroomofbooks you will find the bibliography to this review. It contains many metaphors that accent this book. Steinbeck challenges Hugo on that score.<br /><br />At the core of Steinbeck's message is what differentiates us form animals is choice. Its about timshel. It root comes from the Bible in the story of Cain and Able. Timshel is about God blessing man with free will. In animals a wolf thou will choose. In humans, man may choose. There are a couple of prime characters who make a choice in marriage where virtue becomes yet a gain in a classic novel the center theme. Adam Trask represents `thou mayest. Adam Trask represents a character of blind virtue. Cathy, later Kate represents a monstrous life I `thou will'.<br /><br />Adam begins his adult life going against his core character to be a sensitive creative person and obeying his father's orders by becoming a military man. After years of going against the grain in the military, he is discharged only to wonder lost, broke and homeless; the life of a Hobo across the country of the late 1800's. He needed to find himself. He climbs out of this abyss of life to take up his place in his brother's home in Connecticut. The living arrangements were doomed from the beginning as the two brothers though raised by the same military man, were total opposites.<br /><br />In the course of Adam's sad beginning Cathy as she was called in the beginning of the book had also a dismal start. She and Adam were on a collision course. Steinbeck introduces her character in the following way. \\"I believe there are monsters born in the world to human parents. Some you can see, misshapen and horrible, with huge heads or tiny bodies, some born with no arms, no legs, some with three arms, some with tails or mouths in odd places. They are accidents and no one's fault as used to be thought. Once they were considered the visible punishments for concealed sins.<br /><br />And just as there are physical monsters, can there not be mental or psychic monsters born? The face and body may be perfect, but there is a twisted gene or a malformed egg can produce physical monsters, may not the same process produce a malformed soul?\\"<br /><br />Notice Steinbeck forms this thesis with question marks. He goes on to discuss the ramifications of monsters as follows. \\"Monsters are variations from the accepted normal to a greater or a less degree. As a child may be born without an arm, so one may he be born without kindness or the potential of conscience. A man who loses his arms in an accident has a great struggle to adjust himself to the lack, but one born without arms suffers only from people who find him strange. Having never had arms, he cannot miss them. Some times when we are little we imagine how it would be to have wings, but there is no reason to suppose it is the same feeling birds have. No to a monster the norm must seem monstrous, since everyone is normal to himself. To the inner monster it must be even more obscure, since he has no visible thing to compare with others. To a man born without a conscience, a soul-stricken man must seem ridiculous. To a criminal, honesty is foolish. You must not forget that a monster is only a variation, and that to a monster the norm is monstrous.\\" This question I think captured the attention of millions who have read this book. So I now know I am not alone in dealing with such a monster. This book speaks to our humanity on the question of virtue and how only human beings are challenged with the choice to be virtuous or not. A dog is loyal to a cruel master. A woman can sell out her virtue to a man who has blessed her with mere material kindness.<br /><br />While there are many sub-story lines in the book that raise the question of choice, Cathy who turns to a prostitute who becomes Kate the madam of a brothel is the thread that Steinbeck pulls through the book in an attempt to look at choice, virtue and a monster. WasCathy born a monster? Or was she born into a monstrous world? Steinbeck is not real clear in answering the fist question, but I think he is saying that she was born a monster and therefore created a monstrous life for herself. To the second question her early life was not a bed of roses. She found herself in desperate situations making desperate choices. Early on she learned to utilize her female assets to raise her prospects in living comfort. Her choices through the book were not trivial or an act of survival, but rather brutal as an act of vengeance.<br /><br />Through the twists and turns of revenge drama, Cathy finds herself left for dead at the hand of one of her victims on the side of the road. Her evil deeds had caught up with her. Adam Trask, who had really not found himself yet, discovers her and brings her home to nurture her back to life. In the course of his service he began to let pity paint her as a virtuous woman who met with a bad turn of fate. He blinded himself from her monstrous nature. He fell in love with her and married her. I know this mistake. She conceded to marriage as a temporary escape root to the legal situation she may have been facing. Marrying Adam and moving west to California was a new lease on life, at Adam's expense. There was no love in her heart. In fact on their wedding night, she bedded down with Adam, and then after he fell asleep she went into his brother's room, woke him up and bedded down with him too. I know women, one in particular capable of this, leading me to draw a conclusion as to why the book was popular. I sure wished I had read this book 20 years ago.<br /><br />Cathy the prostitute on the lamb, rather than assume the loving environment of family and a good husband, shoots Adam in the shoulder and leaves him for dead as she heads not too far down the road and takes a job turning tricks in a brothel. This goes to Stienbeck's monster theory. Cathy now Kate, is back in her comfort zone of virtue-less deceit. She knows no other life. She cannot make a better choice, as it is foreign to her thinking. Eventually her high marks with the Madame of the brothel earn her the opportunity to murder her in a very discrete way. So now she, as Madame of the brothel has control of all the city leaders who have surrendered their virtue to her house. I am amazed at the result on society when virtue is surrendered.<br /><br />She is in control of everything...until time's two edge sword cuts her to shreds. As it runs out on her where people discover her crimes, her deteriorating health makes life ... living painful. She like Anna Karenina commits suicide. So Steinbeck, like Tolstoy, leaves it for the reader to interpret their allegoric answer. If the higher being, human though it may be, is the sole domain of choice; did Kate...Anna with loss of virtue exercise choice, or were they monsters out of control? Both East of Edin and Anna Karenin ended with the husband completing his life in peace. Personally, after my twenty year dance with the devils daughter, I look forward to the same.<br /><br />The distinct moral message from Steinbeck: Is presented in a two page dissertation by Steinbeck in Chapter 13: Here is an excerpt: Our species is the only creative species, and it has only one creative instrument, the individual mind and spirit of man. Nothing was ever created by two men. There are no good collaborations, whether in music, in art, in poetry, in Mathematics, in philosophy. Once the miracle of creation has taken place, the group can build and extend it, but the group never invents anything. The preciousness lies n the lonely mind of man.<br /><br />And now the forces marshaled around the concept of the group have declared a war of extermination on that preciousness, the mind of man. My disparagement, by starvation, by repressions, forced direction, and the stunning hammer blows of conditioning, the free, roving mind is being pursued, roped, blunted, and drugged. It is sad suicidal courseour species seems to have taken.<br /><br />And this I believe: that the free, exploring mind of the individual human is the most valuable thing in the world. And this I would fight for: the freedom of the mind to take any direction it wishes, undirected. And this I must fight for against: any religion or government which limits or destroys the individual. This is what I am and what I am about. I can understand what a system built on a pattern must try to destroy the free mind, for that is the one thing that can by inspection destroy such a system. Surely I can understand this and I hate it and I will fight against it to preserve the one thing that separates us from the uncreative beasts. If the glory can be killed, we are lost.<br /><br />In conjunction of the free mind Steinbeck brings in the dichotomy of Cain and Able. Cathy's twin sons, one by Adam and one by his brother, a double untundered construct all by itself that takes on the theme of Cain and Able from two perspectives. Yes Cathy had sex with both brothers in the same night. Neither ever knew of the other's pleasure. In the case of Adam and his brother; Adam is introverted and introspective. His brother is egotistical and reactive. Adam's brother was resentful and did not treat Adam kindly. He beat him once to near death out of jealousy. A parallel is drawn between Adam's sons. As obscure it may seem, there is a progression in the form of evolution of man away from violence.<br /><br />Of Adam's sons the introspective brother finds a life in religion and love for a girl. He surrounds himself with aspects of society that are structured and safe. The other brother was a free thinking maverick, always testing the fringes of acceptable society. It was the maverick who found the courage to discover the truth about his prostitute mother Cathy. Steinbeck draws a colorful picture of the mind of children at a loss for their mother, and their discovery of her evilness. However, unlike his father's sibling rivalrysituation, the maverick loved his socially bound brother and would do anything to protect him. Finally the legacy of Cain and Able is NOT carried forward.<br /><br />In my view, children inherit their moral personification of character from their parents. God help them!!!! It's up to a parent to recognize their own flaws and eradicate them in front of their children. In absence of this too often found neglect of obligation, it is up to children to see the flaw and also make changes where the parent fails. This comes from free thinking; creating the space for children to grow up in a peaceful setting and giving them the confidence to believe in themselves...evolve the human spirit This goes to Steinbeck's opening statement: Our species is the only creative species, and it has only one creative instrument, the individual mind and spirit of man. Amidst my own mistakes in life I strive to meet the lofty goal of one spirit with my children and openly pursue the evolution of One spirit of souls with them. I do it privately; Steinbeck makes a profound statement for millions of readers.<br /><br />If you google cigarroomofbooks you will find the bibliography to this review. It contains many metaphors that accent this book. Steinbeck challenges Hugo on that score.
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|I was able to keep up with the director's editing; he succeeded in surprising us about Liam's wife. But as one person after another was killed off, and I hoped that the next one wouldn't die, it became depressing. The on-location background enhanced the feeling, with the grays of winter, and the film had a slightly grainy look to it. It wasn't until Liam was alone and staring down the wolves that I knew HE wouldn't live either. It was a rip-off; I recalled a short story I'd read many years ago with the same plot, and it ended the same, with the main character getting killed by the wolves, after a Herculean effort to survive. PETA was probably the only ones to enjoy this movie.
B000005RS0|5.0|Tina Turner (b. 1939) originally rose to fame as an R&B singer under husband Ike Turner's instruction, performing with him in an act generally known as The Ike and Tina Turner Review.  In the 1960s her raspy, funky, and sultry voice helped break the mold of what was expected of a \\"girl singer,\\" and Ike and Tina Turner had a number of hit recordings, including \\"Proud Mary.\\"  Even so, they were best known and most successful as a live act--until Ike's frequent physical abuse drove Tina to walk out on him in the middle of a tour.  Thereafter it seemed like Tina Turner disappeared off the face of the earth, performing in nightclubs and Vegas acts and releasing a number of albums that went exactly nowhere.  Until 1983.<br /><br />Given her personal and professional trials, Tina Turner's resurgence seemed to come out of the blue, beginning with the single \\"Let's Stay Together.\\"  Ultimately, the album PRIVATE DANCER would spawn seven singles and sell at least eleven million--according to some sources twenty million--copies.  This was not the Tina Turner sound of the 1960s and 1970s; her voice had mellowed somewhat and the songs were calculated bits of rock and pop, high sheen and glossy.  Even so, Turner could still sing raw, and she certainly showed it on such cuts as \\"Steel Claw,\\" while her softer side showed through with songs like \\"Private Dancer.\\"  To say she nailed it is a major understatement.  It was and is her single best selling album, and it put her on top and she stayed there.  Often known as \\"The Queen of Rock,\\" she is now semi-retired but she can still blow the roof off of her occasional return to the concert state.<br /><br />There are some songs I like more than others--I'm not wild about her take on Bowie's \\"1984\\"--but on the whole I can't imagine someone listening to PRIVATE DANCER and not liking it overall.  The CD release includes a number of cuts that weren't on the original, and everything was remastered in the 1990s, so the whole thing sounds as good or better than it ever did.  Yes, it's distinctly 1980s, but it's one of the decades best examples.  Thirty years later, Tina's magnum opus is still knocking it out of park.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Revieweror better than it ever did.

B0034DGPEU|4.0|A very interesting, engaging book of importance.  Perhaps not a great work of literature, but certainly a novel with thematic substance and historical significance.  A well-written and worthy read with well-developed characters and sensitive insight into the shaping of character and the ways people respond to the circumstances of their lives.
