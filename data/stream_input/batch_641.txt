1932100385|4.0|Every physician who desires to know how to lead patients to wellness and to reduce the incidence of major diseases should read this book. Some thick skin will be needed for the chapter on modern medicine. Dr. Campbell and son write a compelling story of powerful scientific evidence that leads to conclusions about how simple dietary changes can extend healty life span. The book should motivate scientists to insist on openness in nutritional science and to maintain skepticism of nutritional recommendations that come from professional or government committees dominated by individuals with ties to big agricultural and pharmaceutical industry.
0060776579|2.0|My biggest challenge with Harv is that he talks down to the very people he is encouraging to have a millionaire mindset. As a budding entrepreneur, I highly value materials that help me increase my vision and belief in my abilities to attract what I want in life.<br /><br />I find I much prefer the Abraham-Hicks materials, also available through Amazon. Esther Hicks does claim that she is receiving this information from the spiritual realm, but it is easy to believe that claim when you hear how loving and gentle her message is.  Regardless whether you believe she is getting it from 'beyond,' AH teaches in a way that encourages me to believe in my ability to change my circumstances. My business is continuing to grow not just in size but in integrity--something I consider just as important!<br /><br />But, if you like a drill sergeant approach of having someone 'in-your-face,' Harv's materials might be just right for you. I was drawn in by his offering of a free seminar with the purchase of his book. But I've since decided that I won't be going--I have better things to do!<br /><br />With blessings,<br /><br />Lark
B0000E6XH3|4.0|Daft Punk - Interstella 5555 is generally a good anime backed by good electronic music. Both elements are a hard to define. The anime has a late 70s art style, but there is no spoken diolague. So the story telling relies on gesture and imagery. The animation quality starts off good, but 'flash backs' in the later chapters make it feel a little cheep. The music follows a similar pattern. It starts off with daft punk's a-list tracks, but towards the middle of the movie the tracks just are not as strong. <br /> <br />The only other dissapointment would be the extras, which essentially do not exist. There are some sketches, some backgrounds, but that's about it. I wasn't really expecting any more than that, this being a daft punk item, but I would have liked more <br /> <br />Weakness aside, the movie was worth its price. It tells a simple but fun story with great retro characters and stylish music. I've used it on by big screen as wall candy during parties.
0030839939|4.0|Unfortunately this is the only solid fundamental Solid State physics book available. The problems at the ends of chapters have very little to do with the reading and there is no solution manual available. As a source for reading the book works very well, as concepts are explained throughly. However I do not recommend using this book as a source for homework since the problems are more concerned with mindless algebra rather than physical concepts. A lot of \\"make this expression look like this\\" type problems.
B000IZJZLM|5.0|IL Divo is the best music. These fellows are just fantastic. All their CD's are the best. You will enjoy all their Albums.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|In recent memory, very rarely does an album come out that works well as both an album and as a set of seperate songs by themselves. This is one such album. Whether you are listening to the whole thing as if reading a book or picking and choosing songs, you will get an incredible experience. Great album by RHCP.
B000DWMYQ8|5.0|Disney's twist on the classic 'Sky is falling' story is a real 'hoot'. <br />I liked the Father/Son bonding message and the movie is high energy and entertaining for both kids and adults. <br /> <br />Caution Dads: The underlying message might make you evaluate how you interact with your son(s). <br /> <br />Highly Reccomended.
B000GIWS7E|5.0|This DVD has almost everything you could want. It has a great set list that includes favorites from many albums. The arrangements they have with the orchestra are great; the music is already very orchestral, so it flows and meshes nicely.  For all of us guitarists, however, there is a noticable lack of amazing guitar solos--don't get me wrong, there are a few--but not nearly as many as in other DVDs. Try live at the Budokan for more incredible guitar solos than are on Score.  from time to time LaBrie's voice can sound strained, but as a whole this is one of his better DVDs, particularly on the later tracks.  The picture quality is great, and it is a beautiful venue. I would definitely recommend this DVD for all but the most novice Dream Theater fans.
B00005JNX0|4.0|The entire family loves this one. <br />Buy it and start up the microwave. <br />This is already a classic family movie-night favorite.
0679412719|4.0|Marcus Aurelius' \\"Meditations\\" is a celebrated work composed by one of Imperial Rome's most celebrated leaders.  While at times a bit challenging to get through, the most impressive quality of the work is its classic endurance.  Partly a collection of life-lessons and partly a discourse on the psychology of mankind and government, Meditations is as insightful today as it was in ancient Rome.  Overall, an impressive intellectual piece and a good edition to any well-stocked private library.
B000GG4Y32|5.0|REDS is one of the most ambitious American studio films of the 1980s, and this DVD edition provides ample documentation of the long process which went into the creation of this epic film. The film itself is presented in a pristine transfer, and it has never looked better; there are some great supplements. Since this is a reasonably priced DVD package, especially considering the amount of material, this was one of the better DVD releases of 2006.
074356619X|5.0|This DVD is not entertainment, but empowerment, encouragement and great news.  It is the recipe for changing one's life into whatever is desired and includes the roadmap to healing.  I bought several for Christmas gifts and I own the DVD and audio CD's for the car to constantly remind myself to set my sights high and keep going with a smile on my face expecting only the best from the universe.  Nothing can stop me now!
0743201140|4.0|From the moment I started reading, the premise of the book resonated with a fundamental wisdom I've acquired in life. Strengths and weaknesses are two sides of the same coin, and it is important to discover the characteristics that drive an individual, instead of strengths or weaknesses. The author puts a good positive spin to it making the book more approachable.<br /><br />The self-evaluation tool is at the core of experiencing the book. It does a good job of identifying the set of strengths for an individual. However, like most psycho-analysis tools, purists may point out several gaps. The test does not determine the magnitude of a person's strength. The test insists on identifying a magic number of strengths - 5 - instead of making that variable based on the magnitude of that characteristic. Some may have lesser number of strengths with a higher focus on them. Some may have a more balanced personality with a little bit of many strengths. This information is as important as the strengths identified in the first place. The attempt to level the playing field and treat everyone equally is sometimes counter to the whole point of setting people apart based on their profile of characteristics (or strengths).<br /><br />This book was gifted to all employees of the small company I worked with. It was a neat team building exercise. Smart marketing job too. Each book has a unique code that allows the test to be taken by one person only.<br /><br /> My strenghts: Ideation, Restorative, Competition, Activator, Achiever
B000IU3XTW|4.0|I've been waiting for this CD for a long time.  It's impossible to get tickets to a Foo Fighters Acoustic Show so this is one way to hear what goes on.
B000JMK8R4|5.0|This book caught my attention at SF-MOMA. Ever since I bought it, it has grabbed the attention of all friends who visit me. It's a quick read where each page you flip has a certain controversial wisdom. I guess everything about the book screams that Paul Arden is practicing what he is preaching. It is easy to disagree with every conclusion he draws, but that's the very point of the book that conventional wisdom must be questioned.<br /><br />Paul Arden also fits the profile of successful ad gurus. These personalities would trade off controversy over correctness any day. Just by engaging you in an argument about a certain topic, they have achieved their purpose. That of making you have an opinion about that topic and not be indifferent.<br /><br />I wouldn't live my life by this book. But certainly flip a page every once in a while to review my life.<br /><br />Makes it a good coffee table book too. A person who spends 60 seconds would stand to gain something, as would a person who spends 60 minutes.
0618680004|5.0|I loved the book, but then the author was preaching to the choir. <br />True belivers will probably have serious trouble in following the arguments made, as it takes an open mind to consider a complete revision of one's entire belief system. <br />Nonetheless,it may open a person's mind to the fact that there are other equally reasonable systems of belief out in the real world.  <br />For atheists like myself it is simply a well put together integration of the atheist point of view, much in eloquent manner of the late Ayn Rand.
B000I5X81K|5.0|No words need to be said, he is just great.
B000J103PC|3.0|I enjoyed watching Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway bring one of my favorite books to the big screen but I was disappointed that the ending shifted from the ending in the book and the Lily character was not developed more.  Very entertaining though and if you haven't read the book, you'll love the movie.
B000FIMG68|5.0|With LOST 2nd Season, the makers have done a enthralling series. It's almost impossible to stop watching after finishing one episode. <br /> <br />The story is touching an interesting theme and makes it enthralling withhout expecting the end.

B000K7VHH8|5.0|Sean Connery is one of the few men I know who can do no wrong. He played this role with the his usual skill and panache.  He was an extremely convincing as a con man. The beautiful Catherine Zeta-Jones was a good match in this role.
B000007XUQ|5.0|I believe Karen Carpenter was/is one of the best vocalists of our time excepting opera.  Her Christmas album was, in my estimation, the best chrismas music of all the DVD's
6305784116|5.0|The Aristocats is a great movie.  It was purchased for a 6-year-old and a 4-year-old.  Both love it and watch it over and over.  I, as a adult, also enjoyed the movie.
B000G8NY4U|5.0|The Yanni concert I saw on PBS was great and having it on my own DVD-CD is just super. When I feel like being moved by music, well, I watch the DVD of Yanni in concert, or, should I have to travel, the CD is wonderful in my Van. I have no capability to judge music, I can only say that, for me, and my brother's family in Paris, France, the music of Yanni and his orchestra is just marvelous, exhilarating.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I can see why these are used in so many studios around the world.  These are some high-quality cans... may not even find a better one for the price you're paying.  Highly Recommended.
1932907009|5.0|I read Syd Field's book and quite frankly it bored me to death. Then I read \\"Save the Cat\\" and it was as if my eyes had been opened for the first time. This book lays out everything from development to the writing process and it's not bull. If you look at every successful movie out there you'll see the Blake Snyder method. Other books tell different way to write, but what I've found is that these authors have yet to sell a script and are trying to find a different way, THAT DOESN'T WORK. If you are serious about screen writing, this is the book for you. Should be on your shelf, RIGHT NOW!
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|Shanaia Twain's Greatests Hits are really great music. All the numbers of music are really good.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|besides all the others Cds from the Beatles. Love is a masterpiece. The Dvd should have something else besides the songs. Anyway, I LOVEd it.
B000002KOO|5.0|Before Stevie Nicks and more to my liking. I like the instrumentals.
B000I5X81K|4.0|Love Josh Groban.  Somewhat different style than the last CD.  Good sound but not as good as past performanaces.  Saved money by going through Amazon.
B00011F5DK|5.0|It is a great game.  After receiving it from you, wrapping it and mailing it to my 7 year old grandson, I found out he already had it, because it IS a great game!

B000HCO83Q|5.0|These are great movies each one just keeps getting better. If you haven't see it here is a little tip watch through all the credits(yes I know ughhhh!!, but its worth it). There is a surprise for you at the end don't forget lol enjoy!!
0740748475|5.0|this book is a collectors dream. i got it for my fiancee for christmas. he loved it. his mom used to have to walk through blizzards to get him the new books that would come out when he was a kid. very stylish as well. comic strips are very well put together. i recommend it to all who love calvin and hobbes.
B000000XCD|4.0|I ordered the CD as a Christmas gift for my dad.  It took longer then expected to get here but overall it was a good experience.  He liked the CD.  It was in good shape and he was happy with it.
0736063684|5.0|For the money, this text is of extremely high value!! Very descriptive and detailed drawings. I wish I would have had access to this level of detail years ago when I first started to take my training seriously. Provides excellent understanding of muscle and connective tissue and how they interact while employed by different exercises. Definitely one to keep around for ongoing reference!! Enjoy!!
B000HBKCDC|4.0|I LOVE virtually everything that this artist does.  I'll Be Home For Christmas is one of my very favorite Christmas songs...and she does it great justice!
B000I2J5UG|5.0|The item came very quickly, everything was in great condition except for a couple of the arts. The CD is great along with everything that came with it.
B0002ZMJ5M|5.0|It arrived sooner than expected and my husband loves this CD.  The songs are upbeat, some repeats from other records but all enjoyable!
0618680004|5.0|It's time for rational thinking people to step forward and come out of the religion closet. Say it loud and say it proud, \\"God doesn't exist!\\" This book gives a clear, concise argument for why non-believers are the truly compassionate, with the ability to live life to the fullest. Religious folks with their `beliefs', walking their dogma, are allowed to do all sorts of horrible things. There will always be good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things, but for good people to do evil -- that takes religion.
B000H305U0|3.0|Just like the last album. Justin Timberlake and his crew release the good songs as singles. I cannot believe they got me twice. I got the album because I heard the song 'End of Time' on yahoo launch. Turns out I shouldn't have. With the exception of the last three songs on the album, and 'My love', the album sucks!
B000GG4Y32|5.0|I've owned a VHS of this movie since it was available....the DVD promised alot of extras and it delivers - the background saga of making the movie is very interesting (the 'interviews', etc)......I have always loved the story, the actors, the real history of it all, the epic proportions (physical and intellectual) of the life Jack and Louise lived in the early decades of the 20th century.... so I can't be very objective.  It's a very smart movie and I never tire of watching it.
0618680004|5.0|If you are an atheist, not sure if you are or just want to know what atheism is all about - this is the book for you! If you are looking for a fast read - this book is not for you. It seems like every paragraph  <br />contains info and ideas that need to be digested. Logically laid out and presented, this book flows from chapter to chapter. Dawkins is a scholar and uses 10 dollar words freely; so if you are a non-scholar like me, <br />a dictionary at your elbow is a must!
B000I5X81K|3.0|While Awake does again feature Josh Groban's wonderful voice, the songs just don't grab me.  Unlike his previous albums that each had a couple of songs that you just can't forget, this album is just kind of there.  Nothing special, just sort of nice background music.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|You'd think that putting the muppets in such a classic tale wouldn't work, but this movie is wonderful.  They have the right mix of telling the original story in a beautiful way and making it fun and lighthearted.  The music is alway beautiful too.
B000I5X81K|5.0|Josh Groban at his best.  A mix of music that showcases his talents.  If you love his voice, you'll love this CD.
B000F3TBIO|4.0|Mike Patton is never boring, that's for sure.  This album is funky and noisy but you can listen to it, unlike some of Mike's other noise-rock.  It grows on me the more I listen to it.  I really like it.
B00005JNS0|5.0|I bought this movie for my granddaugther and she absolutely loves it (she's 2 1/2).
1582701709|5.0|For many years I have believed in the power of the mind and positive thinking.  This book is the reality of all those beliefs.  It's very easy reading and gives me great insight as to how to make all my dreams become a reality.  I recommend that everyone read this book.  I take a couple of minutes every morning and read just a few pages and it sets my thinking for the day.  It's a truly amazing book.
B0002B15WE|5.0|Bruce Willis and Bonnie Bedelia star in this spectacular action film which is loaded with gunfire and suspense. <br /> <br />Willis stars as New York City police officer John McClane, who has just arrived in Los Angeles to spend Christmas with his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia).  But while waiting for his wife's Christmas party to break up, terrorists led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) take control of the building.  Their goal: $640 million in bearer bonds locked in the building's safe.  John manages to slip away unnoticed by the terrorists.  Armed with only a service weapon and his resiliance, John launches his own one-man war against the terrorists. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, Gruber and the rest of his thugs have begun the laborious task of breaking into the building's safe.  Protected by seven different types of locks, it will be a tough nut for even the most experienced hacker to crack.  John has pulled a fire alarm in the hopes of attracting attention to the building, but Gruber manages to explain that its a false alarm and the fire trucks turn around before reaching the building.  However, John is able to obtain a walkie talkie radio, and he calls an emergency frequency to alert the police of the situation.  The dispatcher doesn't believe John, but then gunfire erupts in the background.  The dispatcher then sends a patrol car driven by officer Al Powell (Reginald VelJohnson) to the scene.  After walking through the building, he believes that nothing is wrong and begins to drive away.  Just then, John throws the body of one of the dead terrorists on the roof of Al's car.  Al immediately calls for back-up (after nearly destroying his car in the process). <br /> <br />Soon, the LAPD and FBI are on the scene.  Al and John have maintained contact over their radios, and a deep bond has formed between the two.  John has continued his methodical elimination of the terrorists, but he's no closer to rescuing his wife.  Will John survive, or will Hans and his remaining thugs get away with the money? <br /> <br />This is a first-class thriller from start to finish.  Bruce Willis is excellent as the undergunned but determined McClane, Alexander Godunov is perfect as Gruber's right-hand man Karl, and Reginald VelJohnson is great as Sgt. Powell.  The action and suspense continues throughout the film, and there's some funny one-liners from Willis along the way.  Two successful sequels followed this teriffic original film. <br /> <br />I give this movie a very  high recommendation.  The action will definitely keep you interested throughout, and Willis' acting is the high point of the film.  Action movie fans will not want to miss this one.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|While this movie doesn't always stay true to the book or the attitudes of the time, it is still a very well done love story.  It skips some of the most interesting things in the book, but overall the story plays out well.  If you are use to watching the mini-series version with Colin Firth, you may be disappointed, but I found if you keep watching it it really grows on you.
B0002BO0HG|2.0|I love  them, but the \\"Hope There's Someone\\" has much more intensity and truth in the ballads...less instruments, less interference. <br />still love them though.
B00005MP58|5.0|This Pride and Prejudice stays more true to the book than others I've seen.  Colin Firth does a wonderful job as Mr. Darcy, as he has certain \\"looks.\\"  Since it is a mini-series and longer than a movie, it is able to capture more scenes and subtleties than the older black and white or the newer movie.
B000GFLEJA|4.0|It was upsetting to see the only review of this title was not a review at all but a complaint against amazon so I had to put in my two cents.  This movie has some of the best performances from Jonny Depp and Benicio Del Toro and Terry Gilliam directs one of his finest films ever.  Too bad this one was missed by audiences in 1998 when it quickly came and went from theatres after the first week.  If  you like Hunter S. Thompson and movies like The Big Lebowski, you'll want to make sure to add this item to your movie collection.  The HD transfer alone is worth purchasing this version, but make sure to check out the Criterion DVD which contains interviews from Hunter S. Thompson as well as a full movie commentary that's as entertaining as the movie itself.
B000I0QK74|3.0|James, please stay home for Christmas and work on giving us the wonderful music we are accustomed to.
B000H305U0|2.0|Justin Timberlake and I are no longer \\"on the same page.\\" I liked SexyBack, but I should have downloaded the song, instead of buying the whole album.
0375505091|5.0|This book is the perfect coffee table book for everyone.  Whether one is familiar with Annie Liebovitz or not, her pictures quickly draw the viewer into the pages.  Once opened it is hard to put down.
B000I0QK74|4.0|If you are getting tired of the same old Christmas music, then you should definitely buy this CD!  James Taylor has taken some traditional songs as well as some new and different tunes and jazzed them up a bit or slowed them down, putting his own style and spin into them.  It is the kind of CD that makes you feel good while you're listening to it and makes you want to hear it again.  I would highly recommend it.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|Al Gore does an exceptional job of conveying the truth about global warming. Using PowerPoint and streaming video, Mr. Gore explains that if we don't make environmental changes soon, we may be dooming the future inhabitants of the earth. Interesting. Informative. Compelling.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|Wintersong is a beautiful compliation of music. Even though marketed just in time for the holidays, the music is such that it could be enjoyed year round. It's a great mix of relaxing, soothing Sarah, with a hint of holiday but not shoving it down the listener's throat. <br />Sarah's version of \\"War is Over\\" is good. My absolute favorite song on the CD is \\"River\\". Her voice is beautiful as ever, and her song list for this CD is satisfying.
B000H5V8DG|5.0|This is the best collection for any Alias Fan.  I sold all of my old box sets to pay for this one, and the Rimbaldi End Game disc was worth every penny.  It has so many bonus features in it and really interestin things.  There is also a book that comes with the box set that answers some of the questions we all had.  It gets the answers from the executive producer, writers, etc.  All in all this is an amazing box set.

B000IU3Y3W|3.0|I purchased this CD + DVD edition which was kind of dissapointing. The sound of audio is superb and it's very good music, but the dvd is more of a documents filled anthology than anything else. There is no live video, but only still images on dvd and lyrics with lots of texts on Neil Young and other players. This is a good item for a Neil Young fans but others just stick to the audio cd edition.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|If you are a die hard CATS fan you will love this.  Elaine Paige is marvelous and of course Michael Gruber is phenominal.  The whole cast is great and we have watch it about 2 dozen times in 2 weeks.
B000HLDFM2|5.0|This is how a collectors edition of a movie should be done.  It has a comic book that the movie is based on, a film cell, and it is 3 discs.  It has director and cast commentaries, deleted scenes, behind the scene documentaries, and a video diary of making Oldboy, which is 212 minutes.  So, if you like this movie, this is definately the edition to pick up.
0375505091|5.0|I love the book, the text and photographs are really fantastic.  Highly reccommend if you are a fan of Annie's work.
0618680004|5.0|Fantastic book, providing scientific rebukes for all the ill-informed arguments for god's existence.  As a top biologist, Dawkins is able to articulate what many atheists and agnostics have been feeling for 2,000+ years.
0205313426|5.0|This is a book that should be given to all school children to keep all their lives and never loan out to anyone. It should be used thoughout ones life time as the basics of writing.
0743201140|5.0|This book helps bring to life a revolutionary twist to what we focus on in our daily lives....personally and professionally.....and how if we just take a moment to realize we'll get further in both by focusing on what we like to do because it comes NATURALLY!!  If all companies would take this to heart and implement it, like some have, it would be a phenomenal work-world!  I'm now trying to help focus on the strengths of my children (ages 7 & 9) so that they grow into young men that are comfortable being who they are and find roles in the world that also appreciate it.

0307236722|5.0|I discovered baking through this book. a lot of really tasty recipes that are pretty easy to make.  If you are a beginning baker, this book will get you started right with basic techniques and ideas.  There are lots of recipes for simple things that you could add into your own experiments, like lemon curd, pastry filling, syrups, mousse, etc.  Sometimes I like to mix recipes - instead of using one kind of sugary goodness, you substitute a different sugary goodness.  This book has got the goods.  Baked that is.  Now if I could do something with all the goldfish i've made out of gold...
B000HBKCDC|5.0|I ususally buy at least one new Christmas album each holiday season.  Sarah's voice is crystal clear and lends itself beautifully to Christmas music.  I cannot wait until next Christmas to listen to it again!

1932100660|5.0|If you ever questioned animal protein vs. vegetable protein you should pick up this book. An amazing and thorough study regarding how animal protein really affects the human body and vegetable protein as well. Various study/comparisons of different cultures and how much difference the food you eat makes and how most have declined once adopting a more westernized diet. He also brings to light the benefits of a whole foods diet. The author makes this an easy read by breaking a lot of the information down into layman's terms.

B00004TWZF|5.0|It is a great movie for all people who are interested in freediving.
B000008HPE|5.0|This is by far one of the absolute best releases by Huey Lewis & the News.  Powerful, hard-hitting, and quite emotional.  Now, I bought my own copy of this CD back in the spring of 1993, and I've had it ever since.  The CD I purchased here was a Christmas present for a special lady friend of mine, named Emily.  And a sweet girl SHE is, I can tell you.  Anyway, I also got my first ever copy of this album on cassette, back during Christmas 1986.  During the summer of that year, \\"Stuck With You\\" was my then top favorite.  But if you read below, you will see that I have since switched to a different and much better song.  I also dedicated this song to Emily recently, and I am not referring to \\"Stuck With You\\".<br /><br />Anyway, my all-time favorite song on this album is not even one of the groups hits.  I am referring to \\"Forest For the Trees\\".  When I first got to hear this song on Christmas Day of 1986, I was hooked!!  I also enjoy pretty much the rest of the entire album, aside from \\"Whole Lot of Lovin'\\".  My mom's favorite on this album is \\"Naturally\\", because it also sounds like a barber shop quartet.  Emily's favorite on this CD is \\"Doing It All For My Baby\\", and it is somewhat of a favorite of mine as well.  Another one of my favorites on this album is \\"Hip to be Square\\", because I have always considered myself a 'square'.  And this song is somewhat of a war cry for those folks out there who are just like me.  It all has to do with the way I was raised, and there's nothing wrong with that!<br /><br />Anyway, for those of you who like hard-hitting, powerful rock music from the '80s era -- but without all the nonsense and profanity -- then I definitely would suggest that this album is for you.  Don't get me wrong, for there are other bands out there who are just as popular as Huey Lewis & the News, if not even more popular, such as Journey and Rush -- whom I also love to this day, but Huey Lewis's band is one of the groups I began listening to early on in my teenage years.  Besides, they are still pretty much \\"The Heart of Rock & Roll\\".<br /><br />Anyway, folks, y'all might wanna pick this one up for your collection.  Enjoy.  The same goes for you, Emily, babe.ge years.  Besides, they are still pretty much \\"The Heart of Rock & Roll\\".<br /><br />Anyway, folks, y'all might wanna pick this one up for your collection.  Enjoy.  The same goes for you, Emily, babe.
B00004STPT|5.0|I can't get enough of the soundtrack and have been listening to it over and over and over again.  Anyone who has watched the movie will want this CD.
B00000IAU3|3.0|I listen to this cd to unwind or relax after work. It's great as a destresser. I would recommend it. My favorites are 1,5,10.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|What can i say except that it is wonderful and well worth buying the cd. We listened to this all thru Christmas and after and it will be a part of our Christmas's from now on!!!!!!!
B000FQ4M58|5.0|I love this CD glad that I got it.  My favorite songs are What About Love, and Cry Over Me, The MOnsters Loose. <br /> <br />I also LOVE his previous CD Coundn't Have Said it Better.  Awesome songs on that too.
B00000JNOJ|5.0|This is a wonderful CD, it has several alternate takes of songs that we've all heard versions of, which I find very interesting. One of the most interesting qualities of blues music is that the performers rarely play the song the same way twice, that's what makes it exciting. Definitely a good CD for you collection!
6304698526|5.0|Rewatching Bullit was nearly a great as seeing it the first time as a teenagers.  The special segment on how the movie was made actually enhances appreciation for the movie.  Bisset was so young in this flick I had to go grab the jacket to figure out who she was even though it was obviously someone I should know.  Great cars, great chase, good plot and unforgetable movie.
B00005JLEU|5.0|The closest Western comparison is \\"Alice in Wonderland,\\" but that certainly doesn't do it justice. The girl Chihiro is transported to a completely different world, and she needs to grow up fast to take care of herself and to save her parents. The characters are perfect and very imaginative, and make this a wonderful movie for children and adults alike.
B0009DBXXG|5.0|Aside from the wonderful performances, watching Bernstein in action is fascinating.  He's the archetype of heroic conductor/leader.
0920668372|5.0|Love You Forever is a book I buy for first time parents. This book is so true-it shows love and the life cycle.
B00005U8EM|5.0|Groundhog Day is my favorite holiday, so this movie was great, and at a good price.
074356619X|5.0|Although this purchase was for a gift for someone, I did have a chance to view the video previously.  It is an interesting, motivating piece which should be helpful to anyone of any age.  It helps one to think positive and to bring positive things into one's life.  It's very stimulating.
B000H7J9RQ|5.0|I think Mrs. Streisand is the one of best singers of the world. I had seen this concert on TV before. I liked it very much. I am awaiting this concert on DVD media. I strongly recommend this DVD.
B000I5X81A|5.0|This is a stellar achievement for the two noted music icons.  One would expect nothing but the best from these two giants of the American blues/rock scene and there is no dissapointment here.  The entire disc is strong and provides steady entertainment, a highlighting of two great performers.
B000HIVO64|5.0|An incredible album that stays in the CD player for weeks. A blend of styles and sounds that is so pleasing to the ears.
0375505091|5.0|Leibovitz reveals a lot about herself in this massive volume.  I was expecially taken with the Susan Sontag photos:  in good health, sick, and finally dead.  Her opening essay gives insight into how this book was constructed and explains the logic for the order. <br /> <br />This is more than a coffee-table book and I can guarantee you will go through it many times as I did.
B0001GMIOE|4.0|There are a lot of substitutes for the original Canon battery, but I always trust canon, and when you read the mAh index, Canon ones are always better than the substitute ones. Plus, I go into the snow mountains a lot, it appears the Canon ones last longer in the cold weather than those substitute ones.
B00005JLF5|3.0|This box set is a mixed bag. The actual shows themselves are quite good for a first season of a Star Trek show, much stronger and better written than The Next Generations first season. However, the video quality was a disappointment. Apparently Paramount didn't bother to digitally restore and remaster the shows, they just slapped them on DVD and put a mediocre 5.1 sound mix with them to sucker Trek fans into paying the original $130 (approximately)price. The new lower price for this set is more appropriate, but if you are looking for a pristine digital presentation of this show you should wait for the High Def release which is probably only a few years away.
B00005JNS0|5.0|Brought this for my husband and he loves it.  It's really a cute movie.
B00020HEL6|5.0|What an amazing voice to come out of one so young. She sounds like shes been singing with a big band for forty years. I look forward to years and years of marvelling at Renee's beautiful voice!!
B00005JNS0|5.0|My son got this movie for Christmas and we have already watched it about 50 times.  The extras are hysterical so make sure to check them out.  We have kids ages 2 to 16 and they all love it!!!
0743289412|5.0|Lisey's Story is King at his best; ranks right up there with the Stand and the Dark Tower series.  Don't let King's talk of retirement and/or running out of stories fool you, this book is fresh, not predictable, and tackles the social ills of abuse and mental health in ways only King would think of doing (i.e. think multiple dimensions/worlds).  Highly recommend the read; you won't be able to put it down!
0691126887|5.0|The book is worth every cent you pay for. The plates by Jorge Rodriguez-Mata are very very good and acurate. The taxonomic classification is not 100% updated, but that is not a real problem.
B000FIMG68|4.0|I was set two copies and paid for two copies and only wanted one, I still have one unopened in the box it was shiped can I get my money back?
B0001GL3K4|5.0|Love Actually is one of my favorite movies! Not only are the individual story lines well written and acted (I especially enjoy the budding love affair between the two porn stars) but the way the lines intersect and support each other is brilliant!  <br />The movie also stays away from the \\"happily ever after\\" ending--not everyone ends up with everything they wanted but all the characters show growth.
0618680004|5.0|Dawkins uses his scientific background to justify his belief that god does not exist, and that evolution provides a satifactory explanation of how the world got be the way it is.  He also suggests that believers want to duck out of such an examination, insisting in their turn that god is beyond the ability of science (or anything)to understand the meaning/existance of god. Monty Python should make a film about this topic.<br /><br />The book is very well written, and very well annotated.  It is clearly a major contribution to the literature.  At the same time it is \\"laugh out loud\\" funny in parts, so it is not onerous to read.
0689835604|5.0|This is my first purchase of a Karen Katz book.  My ten month old loves it!  He likes the lift the flaps on the brightly colored illustrations.  It's also a great way to teach him body parts!  Great buy!
0688172377|5.0|I found Desert Flower to be an extraordinary biography. Waris Dirie's life story, from her childhood as a desert nomad in Somalia to the start of her career as a supermodel in England, provides a great deal of cultural insight. Her strength of conviction, faith in a higher power, and courage in the face of great danger are truly inspiring. This is a very frankly written, often disturbing account meant to spread awareness of the dangerous but all-too-common cultural practice of female genital mutilation. Ms. Dirie brings to light her own personal tragic experience and its impact on her health and well-being. She has worked avidly with the United Nations towards the goal of bringing an end to this dangerous rite-of-passage through educational programs and legal avenues. Ms. Dirie courageously addresses an issue rarely heard of outside of the African continent, and in doing so brings help and hope to countless girls and women who are condemned to suffer lifelong infection and pain, if they do not die as a result of the procedure. This book also contains beautiful pictures of the author and her family. I admire Waris Dirie for her bravery, and I look forward to reading the sequels to this book.
B0002SROT0|1.0|Don't fall for the other reviews.  This is just plain bad music.  I actually threw this CD in the trash after trying to listen to it.  Never could get through a whole cut.
B000F4MLZ8|5.0|I first heard Radin on a soundtrack that a friend let me borrow. I bought this CD shortly after and have not been disappointed. If you like artists like Jack Johnson, Damien Rice, Snow Patrol, etc. give this one a listen.
1932100660|5.0|excellent, must read as it provides the largest comprehensive and convincing study on the relationship between nutrition and health.
B000JJ4GW0|5.0|its a great item , just if you are a fan, cause it has just old tracks, and 2 new ones,  <br />vertigo live in milan, excelent! <br />jorge from mexico
B000053VAZ|5.0|This nice, little movie is hilarious not only because of the eccentricities of Joon, but also because Johnny Depp plays his unassuming self in quiet classic Buster Keaton style. The way in which he and Joon play off one another is priceless. No Johnny Depp collection can be complete without this wonderfully delightful movie!
0321213351|5.0|An EXCELLENT book! Very highly recommended. I like the fact that Josh has used real world code in all the refactoring to patterns examples.
0618154248|5.0|I have read all four books @ 500 times for my daughter. The simple story lines can be read in just a minute or two. But the illustrations offer endless possibilities for you own variations. I have not grown tired of them, and after all I am the one doing the reading for now.
B0009A40ES|4.0|After watching this film twice, I am of the opinion that it really is a satire rather than a horror film. I say this because the majority of the film is really about Patrick Bateman's pitiful attempt to define himself through his obsession with his model-like appearance, his outlandish purchases (such as two Robert Longo drawings in his living room), music selections, and his choices in nightclubs and restaurants. The man is adrift with no real meaning in his life, and thus this is why he is \\"psycho\\".   <br /> <br />He demeans women, seeing them as little more than sex objects or status symbols. He is engaged to a woman (played by Reese Witherspoon) who sees men in the same way he sees women, which is convenient for a while but eventually results in a rupture of the relationship. <br /> <br />He is hyper competitive and overly sensitive to the trappings of success. He becomes especially competitive with a colleague Paul Allen (played by Jared Leto) who has gained recognition that Patrick lacks and seeks.  <br /> <br />Early in the film Patrick lapses into psychotic halucinatory behavior, thinking that he is killing the women he picks up and the collegues who out shine him at work. We are given considerable hints throughout the film that his murders are figments of his imagination. I realize that some viewers will not interpret the film in this manner at all, but I suggest they carefully watch the film and seek the clues that Patrick is hallucinating and thus imaging that his desire to kill is in fact overt behaviors rather than impulsive thoughts. <br /> <br />So why is he an American Psycho? Because he is a terrible empty shell of a person, driven to self definition by the American marketplace. The poor fellow had no original opinions. He actually memorizes CD covers as substitutes for developing an original opinion of the pop music that is integrated throughout the film.  <br /> <br />And yet, in some ways this really is a horror film, for what could be more horrible that a meaningless existance? The author of the book, Bret Easton Ellis, would let us know that many people experience this horror every day.  <br /> <br />The film is actually very good and unfortunately misunderstood and underestimated by most viewers.
B000GYI32M|5.0|I don't understand why alot of people say the OC isn't what it used to be.  I loved this season as much as the first two.  The characters make such a fine ensemble.  Peter Gallagher is amazing, as always. Adam Brody's sarcastic humor still has me rolling. Ben McKenzie is perfect as Ryan. There isn't really anyone in this cast that doesn't give it their all.  I am extremely bummed the show was just cancelled.  THAT IS A TRAVESTY.  The blooper out takes are just hilarious.  If you love the OC, you will love this season.
B00005JOLI|2.0|There were several problems with this film.  The major ones being a terrible screenplay and an even worse cast.  I'm sure by now, many are sick of the comparsions to LOTR, but Peter Jackson set a standard for fantasy movies that is going to be hard to live up to.  Jackson did an excellent job of casting LOTR and writing the screenplay.  He kept true to the essence of the story.  This was not the case with Eragon.<br /><br />  Eragon was almost completely miscast.  The characters of Brom, Arya, Murtagh, Galbatorix, and Durza (the Shade) were all wrong.  I thought the choice for Eragon was ok, but because of the poor script, he came off dull.  Djimon Hounsou was a good choice for Ajihad, but again, the terrible dialogue didn't show his talent.  Jeremy Irons as Brom was awful.  What's actually funny is that he probably would have been better cast as Galbatorix!  And then there are the \\"monsters\\" of the film, which were less than scary.  Urgals are fat, bald men?  And what the heck were the Ra'zac?  Again, here is where Jackson shines!  The Wraiths, Orcs, Goblins, and Uruk-hai of LOTR were all eerie, scary, and menacing to watch on screen.  Eragon's monsters are portrayed this way in the book, but Fangmeier could not convincingly translate them onto the big screen.<br /><br />While I didn't mind the changes that Jackson made to LOTR, and even found some of them to be more exciting than what really happened in the book, i.e. Helm's Deep (sorry LOTR fans); Fangmeier was not as adept at this.<br /><br />Overall, this movie was poorly made.  The  true essence of the plot was lost and the movie came off \\"cheesy\\" at times.  If there is going to be an adaptation of the sequel, Eldest, I will not mind at all if they completely change the cast and crew for that film!  My recommendation - wait for the dvd and after renting it decide if you think it's worth owning.
B000I5X81K|5.0|The CD was amazing. The first track had me.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|I have really liked this one for a long time. <br /> <br />Its funny, and makes you laugh as well as gives you a little scare. <br /> <br />This is really just an enjoyable movie for all ages.
B000DN5W4I|5.0|If you like guitar blues, buy this DVD NOW!  Just when you think that this guy can't blow your mind any more with his incredible speed and sound, He floors you with his blues voice that sounds like a seasoned veteran.  Since watching this DVD, I have been to three of his concerts and I will not miss a show that comes close to where I live.  Joe Bonamassa is the real deal!
1400086035|5.0|I have loved listening to his voice ever since hearing the Harry Potter books on CD (which are awesome as well).  He really captures the feel of this book and does a great job as always.
B00000IREA|3.0|Barbarella is a mind-numbing torture session, even for lovers of bad films.  If the goal was to make the viewer want a steel spike shoved into their head, just to lessen the pain of watching this movie then this is perfection. <br /> <br />Killer dolls, a blind angel, overly hairy men, Jane Fonda in all her glory, a talking mime, pathetic effects and a shoestring of a plot equate to this gem of a stinker. <br /> <br />Even if you love bad films, be careful.  This is REALLY bad.
B00005LC1H|5.0|Naturally, a personal view ... but as mentioned it  has always been a favorite of mine.  Very well written.  Funny to the extreme.  I love it.  Full of very subtle comedy, and Basil's \\"razor-sharp wit\\".  Not the best for American's who have a problem understanding British humour.  Personally, but I am British, I would not be without this in my collection.
B000HCO83Q|5.0|Loved the movie.  Actually saw it awhile ago, but wanted it for my personal collection.  The whole family is watching together
B0000E1WKE|4.0|I've got two words for this CD; SHE'S BACK!!!  It was absolutely fabulous and the \\"Whitney Houston\\" that I remember. HALLELUJAH!!
B000HBKCDC|5.0|This is a beautiful,unique Christmas CD that I will probably listen to all year because it is such pretty music and vocals.Excellent price also!
B000B8IA2G|4.0|I thought that I would never enjoy Stargate Atlantis after seeing an episode of SG-1 co-starring Dr McKay.  However, I am now hooked and cannot wait till Season 2 is released in March.  There are a few episodes that lack a little excitement, but overall this DVD is worth buying.
B000HC2LI0|4.0|The product was shipped in two boxes and was well protected. I was very impressed with the product and the price.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|This account of the Great World War is the most intensive, well researched documentary of WW2 ever made. Sir Laurance Olivier's intelligent narration glides over and through the newsreals and graphic vintage films to not only enlighten, but to bring the events back to life. Through digital remastering, the old films are now crisp and clear--more clear than they were at first viewing in 1974-5. <br />If everyone were made to view this engrossing history of the real horrors of war, all would agree that wars cause nothing but grevious suffering. See it and believe it.
B000FIMG68|5.0|I absolutely love this series. The only complaint I have is that it got lost in the mail and I had to re-order, which meant that I did not get to catch up before the third season started.
1881273156|5.0|This book could save a marriage!  Or any relationship for that matter.  Well worth the read!
1931559317|4.0|Excellent star guide. Its small size makes it very handy to take with you for an evening's viewing of the night sky. I keep it on my desk for when my thoughts drift off to astronomy. I have a telescope that is pointed by hand and this guide is a big help in that regard. Money well spent.
B00005U8EM|5.0|This movie is just plain fun. It's got a love story and it's got mystery. It's got a simple moral to it as Murray learns to be a sociable, caring man. Murray is at his comic best, playing up his minimist style of acting with a lot of physical comedy. The movie has a wonderful supporting ensemble of comic actors in characters that the viewer can care about. It's something the whole family can enjoy. There are some scenes where Murray is attempting to commit suicide that might be questionable for younger kids, but adolescent kids will understand that he is testing the endless day scenario and is not really suicidal.
B00005JNS0|5.0|This is a fantastic movie!! It is not just for boys either.  Very sweet storyline and it will please every age group.
B0007Y08IS|4.0|I found  this movie to be extremely funny but you must know that this movie offends everyone and everything  if you like south park or borat then i think you might like this movie its just as blunt and in your face i only gave it 4 stars because this movie isn't for everyone. its unrated for a reason. i am not saying that its a bad thing just be warned is all. i am glad i bought this movie. because America f yea!
B000AARKOO|2.0|A self hate guilt trip, this movie deals with the events surrounding the fall of Jerusalem to Saladin in 1187. I have no problems with the Crusades being told from the Muslim point of view; the problem with this movie is that the Christians are shown as oozing self hate, doubting their mission in the Levant, when in reality, even this late in the Crusades, they deeply believe in the righteousness of their cause (the movie is otherwise relatively accurate in historic terms). Add to that that the action scenes are very poor, that the acting is uniformly bad (Jeremy Irons is particularly terrible, but you can't forget the awfulness of that new invention of the star system, Orlando Bloom, a stand-in for Argentine footballer Ariel Ortega) and you have a very disappointing movie.
B00000C3G6|5.0|The deepest, most introspective album from Crosby and Nash.  If you are a lover of acoustic blues with meaningful lyrics this is for you.  Had the album thirty years ago and having it back on CD is a dream come true.  Now that they are touring again this album has even more value as new audiences will discover. I would rate this album as my faviourite album of all time. ****** star rating!!
B000001DQI|4.0|Yes!  Not being a huge Elton John fan, I find \\"Yellow Brick Road\\" my favorite.  In fact what I find interesting is apart from Elton's \\"Mad Man Across the Water\\" I really don't like his music at all!?! <br /> <br />But \\"Yellow Brick Road\\" is from start to finish an EXCITING ride!  You can read elsewhere here at Amazon the fine points of each and every song, so I won't bother with that in my review.  I will tell you, however, that my tastes run toward punk, power pop, psychedelia and classical minimalism.  So if I like this record you probably will, too. <br /> <br />Give Elton's best a try, you won't be sorry.
6305558167|4.0|It's great! Just like new. It's every bit as beautiful as  the first time I saw during its theatrical release.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Love it!  Can't get enough of it and I haven't even seen the show yet.  Even my children sing along.  Our favorite songs are \\"Popular\\" and \\"Defying Gravity\\" but we enjoy the entire soundtrack.
1881273156|5.0|This book should be a must read before any marriage, it has a perspective that is truly life changing!  It will help you with all of your relationships!
B000A59PMO|5.0|O.K. people, it is time to get with the program..literally! This show is incredible and it is at risk of being canceled due to lack of viewers. It is hiding out on the new CW and could really use your support. I am a graduate student who has a pension for Buffy the Vampire Slayer and other intelligent shows. The premise of Veronica Mars at first sounded dumb, and the commercials didn't sell me. It wasn't until I read an interview with Joss Whedon (Buffy, Angel and Firefly creator)where he claims VM is the best show ever that I finally broke down and bought season one. I could not stop watching it! It is the smartest show on television hands down. My husband jumped in part way through the season and was hooked, we ran right out and bought second season. With second season in hand we started watching it at 3 o'clock in the afternoon and didn't finish until almost 8 the next morning...we didn't even go to sleep! I have never done that with a show before! Everyone that I recommend it to is hooked after the pilot episode, it is that good! It does have an arc storyline so if you plan on watching it make sure you buy the first two seasons, you will not regret it!
B0000669JL|4.0|If you like Bob Marley, this CD is a good collection of some of his best songs. There are a few key songs not on the album, but overall what is there is good, and the recording quality is good.
B000ICLHIE|5.0|Not to be missed.  This is an amazing body of work that leaves me in awe of Tom all over again.  One of the few living American icons that remains true to himself and his creativity; these songs evoke such passion and imagery any words I can find merely fall short.<br /><br />If you know Waits and are familiar with his music then you won't be disappointed.  If you don't then this is a helluva introduction.
B00005MP58|5.0|I was addicted to this movie when it aired. I was extatic to find it on DVD. This my Christmas present to myself, and the minute it arrived I watched over and over 3 times. Colin Firth is absolutely maddening he's so wonderful in this movie. And then to have him reprise his role as \\"Mark Darcy\\" in the \\"Bridget Jones\\" movies was such a treat. If you are a feminist and a romantic, you'll fall in love with this movie, ELizabeth Bennett and Mark Darcy.
B000J10ERO|5.0|The product was as promised and delivered in timely fashion.  An easy way to shop and have quality material avoiding the Christmas crowds!
B000AGTPUU|5.0|One of my best purchases this holiday season.  Tom Hanks is A+.  I thought I was buying it for my daughter, but it's a #1 movie for my entire family.
B00009W0U4|5.0|I must say that Noe proved that breaking the boundaries is sometimes very much worthwhile. Here's an example of someone definitely giving us the pure decadence of our world. From physical violence to rape to ungracious sex. This is not for the faint of heart that's for sure! <br /> <br />I'd like to know if the scenes in the \\"beginning\\" of the film of the gay sex club were censored on purpose because on my copy of the dvd they are. Usually it's censored of what appears to be on the privates of the men. I then checked the rape scene and the privates of the man isn't censored so I wonder if Noe did it like that on purpose. Can anyone help?
0553804367|5.0|While Stephen Hawking is not the most prominent cosmologist he is certaintly one of the most popular and by reading \\"A Briefer History of Time,\\" you'll understand why.  The book is relatively short and a quick read, surveying the history of the universe and how we have come to understand it in about 160 pages.  A must for those who have the slightest inclination to learn more about the world we live in.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|I love this collection of dvd's. Now I have a better idea about world war 2. It's always good to have such collection in the house. Thank You.
157330087X|4.0|\\"A Tribute to Stevie Ray Vaughan\\" is probably not what you would expect; it's less of a documentary and more of a farewell concert. The artists chosen to play each of SRV's songs tend to lose the feeling of his music in translation over the course of the show, but on the same token it's interesting to see how each artist would have played the song if it was them who wrote it. All in all, it's a good addition to the library of anyone who is a fan of Stevie Ray Vaughan.
B0000CBHOI|5.0|This DVD set takes you to all reaches of the musical spectrum and is a MUST for all blues lovers.  You will learn the beginnings of the Blues music and can appreciate the sound and the feeling that inspired the music.<br /><br />If you are a Blues musician, you have got to get this and learn the origins of this genre and pull from it. And watch your your own music soar.

Its simplicity is profound, its writing extraordinary.  <br />This book is a must read for high school students, college students, professionals who are ever tempted to forsake a God-given life's dream, Karma, destiny, or spiritual inspiration that keeps one always striving forward to a goal or goals. I believe that each person who reads The Alchemist will identify something of themself. Thank you, Paulo Coelho for your wisdom and talent.  <br />After reading The Alchemist, I had the privilege of reading Lisa Rogak's <br />Unauthorized Biography of Dan Brown, The Man Behind the DA Vinci Code, and all I could think about was the shepherd boy in Mr. Coelho's book. Dan Brown is the quintessential modern day, shepherd boy. <br />
006112429X|5.0|Lionel Shriver makes quite a meal of poking the meat of nature vs. nature and  the very question of even having children. This was my second purchase of WNTTAK as I'd given my first copy away; it's been well worth the second purchase.<br /><br />While the jacket copy would make you think it's simplistic run-of-the-mill chick/mom fodder: Momma vs. Evil Child, it's anything but. Shriver examines all angles of raising a precocious sociopath--from the over-understanding father to a mother who doesn't bond with her son until after he's killed 9 people at his high school.<br /><br />Shriver's writing and her examination of the subject (child teen murderers) is first-rate.
0843178418|5.0|The series of books (Mr. Men & Little Miss) is a terrific way to talk with kids about various aspects of life!  My son is 26 now and still remembers our reading these books together when he was small.  His favorite was Mr. Messy.  The illustrations are very appealing to children and the stories make their point with great humor.
0375505091|3.0|This unusual collection contains some spectacular \\"public\\" work by Leibovitz, but at last emphasizes her personal side more than her well known conceptual work. The photography is compelling, moving and sometimes magnificent, but too many pieces are destroyed by their placement as spreads over the middle crease in the book, a very disappointing decision. The effect is devastating.<br /><br />Nevertheless, Annie Leibovitz stands as a major American icon in the world of photography and her work deserves to be collected and preserved in whatever format.
B000HCO83Q|2.0|As is often the case with movies and their sequels, we see a dwindling in story content, authenticity and strength.  All too often the problem arises from the egos of those involved in the acting.  Such is sadly the case with X-MEN: THE LAST STAND.  Someone got sidetracked and decided that minor characters should all of a sudden be major players, \\"mutating\\" the story in ways that, in the end, destroy the dramatic value that might have been possible had things been left alone.<br /><br />Enter Halle Berry.  Apparently she must have felt that her role as Storm was far too minor.  No doubt her insane argument was, \\"Hey, I've got an Oscar, I'm the greatest, I'll call the shots now and don't you forget it!\\" But don't take my word for it. Read the original comic books. Look at the original character and story balance there. Storm was never more than a bit player and, all things considered, the stories were better off as a result.  So what the heck happened here?  Every time the scene changes, there's Halle Berry on screen. She dices, she slices, she makes frozen yogurt. And to make matters considerably worse her lines are contrived, stilted and pathetically acted.  And don't get me started on her ridiculous hairdo. The movie should have been more appropriately titled X-MEN: DEATH BY STORM.<br /><br />And given Berry's paltry overtones, everything else unravels leaving a tangled mess that is not only irreparable but hilariously comical as well. The other actors did their very best in their various roles but, given Berry's \\"overpresence,\\" never had a chance and neither did this movie.<br /><br />THE HORSEMAN
B000I5X81K|4.0|Open letter to Josh Groban (And all you Amazon readers out there),<br /><br />Dear Josh,<br /><br />My mother listens to your music on repeat allllllll day long. I work with her, which means I hear it, everyday, all day, on repeat.<br /><br />That is why I was SO HAPPY to see that you have a NEW cd out.<br /><br />Thank you thank you thank you!<br /><br />Now we have something different to listen to all day every day over and over.<br /><br />(I confess, If I heard that 'My Confessions' song one more time,... well, let's just say, I'm glad for the new music. Thanks.)<br /><br />=)<br /><br />ps: Other Groban fans, and friends of Groban fans.. can y'all relate?!

0446677450|5.0|This book has revolutionized our life and the lives of our kids and business associates, we highly recommend it.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|Five stars says what I think of this cd.  Amy Lee & the band is great as always and I am already excited about the next cd.  But for now I will just keep enjoying The Open Door along with their other albums, which are like awesome.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|The Rent dvd was purchased as a Christmas gift for a teen, and she's watched it many times. She absolutely loves it, and highly reccommends it to everybody.
B000HEWEEE|2.0|This review is intended for those who have seen the film. Don't read it if you hate spoiler reviews. You've been warned. *** *** *** I liked the idea, but I found the ending very confusing. It seems they got the time line a bit mixed up. He gets killed at the beginning of the movie while she's sitting having lunch with her mother. Yet he is late for his *evening* out with her, as she is having *lunch* in the park. The timing doesn't work out at all as far as I can tell. Other than that, though, the movie was enjoyable. I'm not a big fan of either of the main stars, but they were both pretty good in this movie.  Another big disappointment was the Paul McCartney song \\"This Never Happened Before.\\" That must be one of the most lackluster songs I've ever heard, and this is coming from a long-time McCartney fan.
1881273156|5.0|I absolutely LOVE giving this book for wedding and shower gifts, to friends who have been married a long time, and talking to other people about it!  In fact, I have created my own little \\"talk\\" about the 5 Love Languages and give to to some of my women's groups... it doesn't have to be just about your \\"mate...\\"  You speak language of love to ANYONE you have a relationship with... your kids, your parents, your friends...  <br /> <br />This product arrived in a timely fashion and was exactly as advertised.  Thanks for doing business this way!

B00005JO9J|5.0|I was told that this item would not ship to me until 1/12/07, it was supposed to be a Christmas present, but, better late than never. Then, my order was cancelled. Immediately after Christmas, I was telling someone my story, and they gave me another website, and I had my calendar in 3 days!
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Al Gore's message may be focused on U.S. citizens most directly, but it's something every adult and teenager on the planet needs to watch. He's a surprisingly classy and effective speaker, and if you think you don't need to see it, you've probably been successfully manipulated by the oil lobby! We need to turn ourselves and our western lifestyles around now. Watch this film and share it with your friends, your family, your colleagues and anyone else you can think of.
0307346609|5.0|I am a huge fan of the zombie sub-genre of horror but I have never seen them portrayed so realistically as in this book.  Though they may still be dumb and slow Max Brooks shows how dangerous they can be just through sheer numbers as they nearly bring about the apocolypse. Even more scary though are some of the humans that are \\"interviewed\\" in this book.  It really shows how low humanity can go in the face of real danger. Plus the relation to current times and events is spooky. If you like books that grip you and never let go give this one a try!
B000I0QK74|5.0|The combination of James Taylors way to make music and traditional christmas-songs produces an excellent result bringing a new dimention to these songs.

B000HC2LI0|4.0|Political drama isn't one of my interests, but the West Wing's complex personal relationships make it worth watching. The first three seasons are excellent; five star material. The last two seasons are decent, but not great. But the entire collection is superb because the characters grow and change. After watching the entire series straight through in three weeks, I went back and watched the first and last episode of the season, just to compare CJ and Toby. I've also made notes on favorite episodes in the episode guide so I can find particular scenes quickly. The set is well-designed; each season's DVDs are collected in a folder with the episode guide and book of selected scripts tucked in the back; the entire box fits my shelves neatly.
B000H5U832|5.0|this is a cute movie and it to funny and some parts are sad but all in all its a very good movie for the kids to watch
B000683VI4|5.0|What a great story to demystify the condition of dementia and Alzheimer's. The opening scene of birds flying over water is spectacular. Well acted.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This documentary is required for all earth citizens.  This is not just about the USA.  However, the US citizens need to pay special attention to the content of this documentary and then become willing to take even a small action.  The documentary is well done and clear in its message.  Buy it and show it to your friends.  We need a higher level of consciousness regarding our actions and their consequences.
B000GIXEIG|3.0|I was very excited to watch this movie, but it was slightly disappointing.  The acting was not quite up to par, and the movie lacked the fantastic story-telling that I was hoping for.  I'm definitely not sorry that I bought the movie, but it won't be one that I watch over and over.  I usually watch a movie two or three times before my opinion is set in stone, so maybe this one deserves another viewing.
B000AP04OM|5.0|Wonderful music you love to sing along to. Quality movie you can share with your children and they love it too. My daughter loves this movie and rewinds it constantly to sing along with the songs over and over again like \\"Do, a dear, a female dear...\\" and the puppet show song \\"Yodel-a-hee-hoo\\". A must for kids and adults to have in their collection. Timeless.
B000H7JD4K|5.0|It's heavy, it's Maiden, what else do you need?<br /><br />Right, it's not the Maiden from mid-80's, but their maturity reflects on their music since \\"Somewhere in Time\\" with a few lows (Bailey's era), but they seem to be re-taking momentum ;-)
B000H5U832|5.0|this is a real adorable for kids of all ages.  Enjoyed it with my kids and grandkids!!
074322454X|5.0|This book is a great read. A poignant account from a group of WWII airborne veterans, not high-ranking staff officers, that experienced the inhuman realities of war. But more than that, the underlying message, as the book was appropriately titled, was a group of young men with eclectic backgrounds and aspirations came to be brothers. I would be doing the book injustice if I tried to write an accurate synopsis of it, and by accuracy not only do I mean the historical facts but also the human emotional triumphs and travesties that is conveyed in this work. I'll let the author and accounts from the various members of Easy Company, speak for themselves. Get this book, it's definitely one to add to your library.
B000FIMG68|4.0|Loved it!  much better than the first season...many new characters, and was very suspenseful...

B000GPIPSS|5.0|You can't beat the original Bela Lugosi or Boris Karloff movies -- I don't care what fantastic special affects the new movies have.  There's something about these old black and white classics that todays movies can't top.  These movies introduced the \\"monster\\" movies and they are the best!
B000HEWEEY|2.0|I received the Ultimate Collector's Edition for Christmas, and was extremely grateful.  The movie is an absolute science fiction classic, worthy of FIVE STAR accolades, however, I highly recommend that anyone interested in the 50th Anniversary Edition consider the Forbidden Planet Two-Disc 50th Anniversary Special Edition instead of the Ultimate Collector's Edition.  The two-disc version contains everything the movie fan really wants, and at half the price.<br /><br />Please allow me to explain why.<br /><br />The Ultimate Collector's Edition comes with a second movie, \\"The Invisible Boy\\" which also stars the legendary Robbie the Robot.  While that is nice, I never wanted nor cared about the second movie.  This packaging, while attractive, is akin to having the price substantially boosted on you for purchasing a second movie you're not really interested in.  It's very much like those offers here on Amazon you'll see when you're looking at a movie you might want to buy, and then they suggest \\"buy this along with \\"Name of Movie you Don't Want\\" for $50.00\\".  It's nice for the suggestion, but I don't think I've ever taken one of them.<br /><br />Next, the tin package is cool, but it contains many other things you'll never really care about.  The miniture of Robby is just that.  It's a cat toy, truth be told, and if you remove it from the tin, you'll lose it.<br /><br />The package also comes with \\"lobby cards\\" for both Forbidden Planet and the movie you don't really care about.  They're a little bit bigger than post cards, and chances are they will go back into the tin and never be seen again.<br /><br />The extra features on the Forbidden Planet DVD are apparently very similar to the ones on the two-disc collection.  I'm not certain if the two-disc collection has some of the deleted scenes (which, while short, were fascinating to watch), but the other features offered on the two disc seem to be missing from the \\"Ultimate\\" which makes me wonder why they considered that name at all.  You'd figure \\"Ultimate\\" would have it all, but it very clearly doesn't.<br /><br />I'm not going to review the movie itself any further than I have here; it's brilliant, and I'm thrilled to have it in my collection (although the tin takes up way too much room on the shelf, and I really don't think that the cardboard insert would really stand alone very well if I removed it for the shelf).<br /><br />To sum it up, anyone considering this purchase should really look at the 50th Anniversay Two-Disc version before making a decision.  My advise?  Just go to the two-disc version and hit \\"Add to Cart\\" and don't worry about what you might miss from the \\"Ultimate\\" version.uld have it all, but it very clearly doesn't.

B00003CX9W|5.0|We had the videotape of Fantasia from about almost 20 years ago and it was showing its age.  I started looking for a DVD version here on Amazon and found a sealed original copy advertised through this seller.  It shipped on Tues. after New years and I received it on Wednesday. <br />The DVD version is much better in both sound quality and picture quality.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I purchased 5 copies of this movie and gave them out to people with this request, \\"Watch it, then pass it on.\\"  Every individual I've spoken with who has watched this excellent docu-drama regarding the effects of Global Warming says the message is powerful and compelling.  Put aside any preconceptions you have about Al Gore... he does a wonderful job of leading viewers through this incredibly important topic.  Watch it with your kids.  Watch it with your Sunday School class.  Watch it with your neighbors.
B0007Y4USW|4.0|I expected a little more of this album. She continues to blow, but I feel there's not enough \\"Maraih\\" in it. Gotta give up the 4 though because she still runs neck and neck with Whitney as my favorite female vocalists.

B000E1ZBH2|2.0|I gave this as a gift for christmas, but it also bring fond memories for my daughter, for ther 19 birthday we went to the play-Pride and Prejudice at our local theatre.  It's a great movie, and she glad to have it in her collection of DVDs.

B000I5Y8XM|4.0|This is my 7th CD from Moya (Maire). Her voice continues beautiful like when she was leader vocal from CLANNAD.
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|There is not much left to be said about this movie from the many in-depth reviews, to continue to analyze the movie further would be redundant. I will say however, in spite of the actor who played pink doing his own vocals/lines in the movie and some of the songs redone with a more theatrical sound. The movie is perfect, especially since they didn't add any dialogue from what has been done in the album, what you hear on the CD is what you hear in the movie. At some points disturbing though, not something I would suggest children to watch but for anyone who has a love for this band as I do, this is a must-have. If you have an advance stereo system this movie will further the effects. Don't hesitate, buy ASAP, it's well worth the money.
0060734191|5.0|I first read Sabriel in high school, and upon going to college, I decided to finish off the series and bought the box set. I am impressed with Nix's detailed worlds and ability to create an image in the minds of his readers. This is by far one of my favorite Fantasy Trilogies
B000006TRV|5.0|As I said about the movie version of the album There is not much left to be said about this album from the many in-depth reviews, to continue to analyze it further would be redundant. Therefore, I shall just give my opinion in a nutshell, this is an amazing album that was very ahead of it's time, it's a beautiful and disturbing album about a rock star who has done and seen it all on the verge of snapping. Whether you choose to just listen to a few songs or listen to the whole album, you should just at least once just concentrate on the deep story, take in the lyrics and let it seep into your mind, this truly an album to be experienced, rather than just listen to.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|What an amazing talent Sarah Mc is. Her voice is a goosebump creator (in a very good way), and her writing and arranging are as good as it gets. Most of what she sings about in her original material is on the introspective, somber to depressing side, but that works fine when the mood is right, and it often is for me. The arrangements she put on some of the traditional Christmas songs were stark and surprising at first, but quickly just sounded right after a few listens. My only complaint is that she put a couple of songs (River and Song for a Winter's Night) on this CD, and I already had them on earlier releases, but that's a small price to pay for the overall experience.
055358202X|5.0|Even if you aren't a Fantasy Fiction buff... the Ice and Fire series is more like the Sopranos meets Excalibur.<br /><br />Martin is great, and he's crafted a wonderful page-turner to the series.<br /><br />Do not be put off by the volume of text - the read is easy, suspenseful, and entertaining.<br /><br />His mastery at creating a believable realm and detail in the lives and society the characters live (and die) in is matched only by the nature in which he can create a visceral and engaging environment for the reader. Each character has a distinct voice and the world is percieved (and shared) through the eyes of the characters artfully.<br /><br />I found myself cheering or booing in my head as the story unfolded and took me through the roller coaster politics and adventures of Westeros and the surrounding lands (and waters).<br /><br />Do understand that this is part 1 of the 2 part ending (bringing the series to 5). Dance of Dragons is forthcoming as of this writing.
B000JK8OYU|4.0|Hats off to George Martin and his son for taking the chance to radically remix Beatles material and make it very interesting. The CD is well worth the listen for those that know the material and also for those that don't. I also congratulate the remaining Beatles for allowing it to happen. They could have easily said \\"no way\\", but they allowed their material to be modified to bring renewed joy and appreciation for the umpteenth time, and I certainly didn't get the feeling they were doing it to cash a few more checks. Go Beatles and Martins.
B00003CX5P|3.0|It was the first CGI-intensive effort by Lucas in the Star Wars universe, some was good, some was not as good. There were a lot of complaints about the CGI, but the digital sound was a tremendous improvement.<br /><br />It starts the storyline of Star Wars, and we are introduced to several pivitol characters at the early stage of their importance to the plotlines. It is really a Genesis story for the Star Wars saga.<br /><br />The pod race scene (many complained how it didn't fit the rest of the storylines) was a bit of an intergallactic American Graffiti with some high speed adventure and quite a spectacle - it's a fun segment, even if the impact on the overall story is minimal (soume would argue that the whole thing could have been skipped).<br /><br />Jar Jar Binks, the goofy Gungan exile, has gone down into infamy as the most hated creature/character according to the general Star Wars Fan Base due to some annoying manner of speech, but his goofy antics were adding some comic relief and are easily overlooked, if not ignored.<br /><br />The shining point of the movie is the lightsaber battles - the complexity and martial richness was what Lucas has pined for all these years and technology finally was starting to catch up to his imagination. Darth Maul is one of the best Sci Fi villians to ever grace the silver screen, and engages in some dynamic combat with the stalwart Jedi Knights. Duel of the Fates is, perhaps, one of the best sci fi fight scenes to date.<br /><br />Not the best Star Wars movie, but a necessary addition to the collection for both completeness and a few great cinematic moments in the series.

B000002GYI|5.0|I came into the genre backwards... I would gravitate to any classic rock song with a Moog in it, then got into modern trance as background music while I worked... I started to discover these amazing German composers who are the grandfathers of all electronica.<br /><br />Computer World is an excellent album with some great pieces in it. Once you get Pocket Calculator in you head you will never get it out! \\"I'm the operator with my pocket calculator [beep, boop, bong!]\\"
B000AYEL1A|5.0|I have been looking for this movie, unsuccessfully, for years.  It was worth the wait. Romance in abundence, a story of success and failure, of the rise to fame and the road to destruction.  a romance story that even a macho man can enjoy.  It will remain, always, as in the top 5 of my favorites
B000002C1W|5.0|It's Gilmour, really, but the style is Floyd, and the songs are some of my personal favorites - I prefer Gilmour's smooth mellow over Water's pitchy vocals anyway... If you like Delicate Sound of Thunder, here are many of the studio versions of the later songs in Pink Floyd's catalog.
B00001W9G0|5.0|I saw this movie in the theatre as a teen.  I have seen it on cable but sooo much was cut.  I bought this for my 17 year old daughter for a gift.  She laughed and cried in all the traditional places and has added it to her favorite list.  I am sure that it will be shared, one day, with her daughter - far in the future.
B000024D4R|5.0|But some excellent cerebral and socially poignant works. This concept album has quickly risen to my \\"most played\\" tier of my collection. Great background music or something you can focus on while you pick out small details and subtle audible treats in the compositions.

0316172324|4.0|This is one of a number of recent books that could be subtitled \\"Aren't Humans Quirky?\\".<br /><br />You will learn a great deal about how your preception works, often in counter-intuitive ways.<br /><br />It is a light read that will both entertain and educate you. You may come away with the tendency to make less assumptions about your experiences and the need to pay much close attention to what is going on around you and how you preceive it.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|This edition of Mary Poppins is amazing. I never thought i'd learn so much from a commentary, lol. The shipping was amazingly quick as well. The condition of the entire package was excellent!
0618680004|3.0|I bought this book because it was highly acclaimed as a scholarly & timely contributioun to the current Religious controversy (Christianity v Islam v Secularism etc). As a lifelong C of E Agnostic I also felt a personal  update on Atheism was desirable. Broadly I was disappointed in that Professor Dawkins told me nothing new despite his advantage over me as a lifelong Academic as against a knocked self educated  man in the street. He is entertaining enough,but in his so old hat Darwinian Atheism he doth protest too much. Nevertheless I gave the book to my Son-in-Law for Christmas as a book that  currently he needs to be able to talk about.   <br />
B000EXZDOQ|3.0|With a deep love of the blues Coverdales early incarnation of Whitesnake was a radically different beast to the later hirsute version adored by US audiences in the late 80's. Knowing this and wanting to explore further I scored this album cheap - it was allegedly a classic so seemed the place to start. My verdict can be summarised as follows;<br /><br />- Lots of space in the songs and arrangements (ie not much happening).<br /><br />- A lot of mellow numbers of classy blues based rock 'n' roll. Note the term rock 'n' roll, not hard rock, which is an important distinction.<br /><br />- Plenty of lovely vocal melodies form Coverdale. His voice changed over the years and both earlier and later versions are pretty darn cool. Regardless of what era of Whitesnake you prefer it must always be said the guy can sing.<br /><br />- Fool for your Loving. A flagship song. One redone later in the bands career. Some like to argue the respective merits of the different versions but I prefer to just enjoy them both. This is the first song on the album and is ably backed up by the funkier styled Sweet Talker and the more juttering Ready An' Willing.<br /><br />- Utter boredom from track 4 onwards.<br /><br />Yep, you read that last point correctly. Under the delusion that his fans actually want to hear him sing the blues that's exactly what Coverdale gives them. Now it's gotta be said that anyone thinking they're gonna get anything like 1987 from this album should brace themselves for a surprise. Chunks of these tunes are so slow you can't even tap your foot to them. Though the boogine in the belly of Ain't Gonna Cry No More interspersed with keyboard sections is kinda cool, and ditto for Black & Blue.<br /><br />This album gets two stars for having the always interesting Coverdale on board crooning away through pleasant enough tunes while Martin Birchs' knob job makes sure the tunes breath.

B000I5X81A|5.0|The Road.. is a very good album if what you are looking for is Cale lyrics and guitar licks with the man who made Cales's song's classics.    <br />To the listener familiar with both men's styles, it is sweet to be able to listen to the two voices and guitars weave among the songs.  Few know of Cale's influence on music but this was recorded in his style of voice and guitar not covered up by the other.  A real gem.
B0001US62I|4.0|This was a very interesting movie.  A friend told me to watch this movie after I told him that I really liked the movie The Skeleton Key.  I think I liked The Skeleton Key better... but this was still a really good movie.  There are a few scenes with nudity in it.  Not a movie for the youngsters. We had to stop the movie a couple times to talk about it and at the end my husband was the only one who guessed how it was going to end.  A good movie if you want a movie that keeps you guessing.
B00005RY7X|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite Albums to Listen to.  If you are new to Andrew WK buy this album over his second \\"The Wolf\\" it is good to but this one takes the cake.
B00006878K|5.0|This album is not only the best of Albert King's it is also one of the best blues albums of all time. If you are into blues then there's no need for introduction, cause you already know it by now. If you are beginning to blues or just love good music you can't find a better place to start. Albert King is one the major influences in blues and guitar music. And this is his best.
B000BKJ78U|5.0|Good value, but I had to return it because they were the wrong episodes.  My mistake!
B000687M48|5.0|It's one thing to hear her angelic voice above the thundering guitars and drums, but yet another to see Amy Lee perform the songs that made them famous.  I am forever in love with Evanescence after seeing and hearing them.  This is a must for any Ev fan, and a must see for any Rock fan!! <br /> <br />Dino Smith <br />Chattanooga, TN
B000I5X81K|4.0|Still good, but not as great as his previous two albums. There are three, four songs in this album that I love to listen to, a couple that are so so, and the rest I feel kind being disappointed. but if you are a fan of Josh, you might still want to keep a copy of it -- like me, to only listen to his voice makes me happy~
B000301YY8|5.0|It's been quite some time since someone has allowed themselves to be as transparent as Blunt.  He tears his heart out and allows us to experience it with him, and because he does he connects with each of us who have ever experienced life's blows.  He truly sings from the soul, and with a voice that bids you stay.  If you don't have this disc then your collection of great music is incomplete. <br /> <br />Dino Smith <br />Chattanooga, TN
B000I5X80G|5.0|Terrific set (albeit partial) from 1970s concert tour. <br /> <br />Smoking guitar work and overall much better versions presented here than in the studio recordings.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|I fall in the former group.  Now before you send the Blue Meanies after me, hear me out.  We fortunately have the exquisite originals, so I feel comfortable in enjoying this new treatment of these much loved songs.  The only new one I didn't care for was \\"Because\\".  However, the other offerings were truly a joy to hear.  I loved the layered songs, and though it's nearly sacrilege, I really liked the new \\"Hey Jude\\".  It works especially well for those that have less than enough patience for the original seven minute version as it is only four. <br /> <br />If you are a Beatle fan, you should add this.  If you've never heard them (which I can't imagine at all) then this would be a very good introduction (but do go back and get the REAL versions). <br /> <br />Dino Smith <br />Chattanooga, TN
B000ICL3KG|4.0|An Inconvenient truth documents in detail and beyond any shadow of a doubt that our Country and our Government has ignored the most compelling issue of the Planet. There is still hope.
B00006I53S|2.0|Wow, I'm looking through the other reviews and I have to wonder if I didn't get a bum sample - or maybe my expectations were out of line, but the photos I took with this lens seemed a bit flat and didn't have that \\"pop out of the page\\" quality that defines good optics for me.  <br /> <br />Even so, that's not what killed this lens for me. First, the IS is an early implementation and just never worked that well for me. I've used other later generation IS lenses, and the difference is enormous: photos you never thought to take handheld before suddenly just work with the new generation of image stabilized optics. With the 28-135, it never felt that way. I'm guessing it bought me at most 2 stops, if that much. <br /> <br />But the one thing that really condemned this lens for me was the terrible ergonomics (size, weight, balance) when mated to the Digital Rebel XT. I never before appreciated just how unergonomic that camera body is, especially the need to curl one's pinkie under the body - and indeed, when mated to the featherweight 50mm, it doesn't matter and makes for pleasurable photography. But with the 28-135 mounted, the camera started to feel very awkward to hold, and even after short photo sessions I'd notice pain in my wrist, as the lens overbalanced the camera and I continually had to torque it back to horizontal. As I said, I never noticed this before with the lighter lenses, and I still believe that the Rebel XT is a great body when mated to those. But I couldn't have a walkaround lens combination that I just plain didn't like holding.  <br /> <br />It just so happened that a neighborhood camera store had a Nikon D200 + Nikkor 18-200VR kit in its display around that time. I promptly returned the 28-135mm lens to Amazon (yay for customer service!) sold off the rest of my Canon gear to friends, and used the money towards the Nikon kit. Now, the D200 + 18-200VR is a beast in size and weight. But it's so well balanced that I can use it heavily all day and not feel any wrist strain (tired arm muscles are a different story). The Nikkor 18-200VR lens is worlds better than the 28-135 Canon: incredibly sharp and contrasty, colors come out looking rich, and the autofocus speed (thanks to a ring ultrasonic motor) is as good as any Canon. The image stabilizer on it really DOES buy me 4 stops enabling crazy stunts like shots out of moving vehicles at dusk. And I've had several occasions to thank the weatherproofing on the D200 body. All in all, if I return to Canon at some future date, it will be for the 17-40 f/4L lens mated to a full-frame camera for landscapes. I'll give the Canon 28-135 a miss and stick with Nikon for walkaround photography.
B000AL730O|5.0|Every time I've walked the aisles of (now defunct) Tower Records, BestBuy, F.Y.E, or any other music outlet, I show this CD to the person working that section and turn it upside down.

B000B7BRMM|4.0|I ordered Ms. Krall's 'Live in Paris' CD at the same time.  The differences between that and this Christmas album were striking.  While the Paris tracks were wonderfully energetic, Diana seemed to be having a bad day vocally.  Was it jet lag, to much exposure to cigarette smoke, something else?  Whatever, her tired, haggard vocal tone ruined the disc for me. <br />OTOH, the obvious studio Christmas effort was apparently with a rested voice.  While I can't offer enough praise for her musicanship (I really love Jazz vocalists who also instrumentalists), her voice is the least impressive of here music assests, to me lacking in breath support.  But on the Christmas album it is in good enough shape to not be a problem.  The big band arrangements are to-die-for.   <br />Bottom line - purchase Paris disk forewarned.  And do not hesitate to pick up the Xmas album.
B000IOM0YM|5.0|The original 4 Kiss  on this DVD is phenomenal. A must have for any Kiss fan especially of the early days when it all began. You won't sit down when you watch this cd, it will make you GET UP!  It has footage of Space Ace's wedding even (im a big ACE fan) so that footage is a must have in itself!! <br /> <br />get it don't miss out.
B000IJ79WU|3.0|Dick Donner's cut of Superman II can be considered as better than Richard Lester's version, or disappointing, depending on your point of view. If you want to watch a Superhero movie you're going to be a little let down. The Man of Steel in this film does not become human in body only, but displays all the weaknesses ordinary humans possess, including selfishness. The scene where Kal-El talks to his deceased father and expresses his desire to be an ordinary man is developed in a deeper and more credible way than in Lester's version. Superman wants this because he is fed up with serving the human race and longs to be able to share a normal life with the woman he loves, just like everyone else. This trend holds truth on the whole film: Donner profoundly develops the main characters and comes up with a story that makes more sense than the one in the original film. However, the end result is a lot darker. You don't sympathize with Superman as much as you do in the first two films because he simply is not very much of a hero until the last part of the movie. Oddly, though, the film does start out on a much more humoristic note than Lester's cut, but unlike the 1980 version, the comedy simply is not very funny and, at times, inappropriate. Having filmed the first and second film simultaneously but having been fired halfway though completion of Superman II, Donner never had the chance to finish the movie the way he wanted it. Hence, several scenes are cut short, giving the impression that something is missing. For instance, those that are unfamiliar with the original script for Superman: The Movie might find the ending too manufactured: the Man of Steel turns back time once more. However, Donner had originally intended to have the first movie end differently so Lois would have lived. Hence, there would be no need for Superman to turn back the clock. But deadlines meant there was no time to finish the scenes needed for this ending and Donner had to use the one he intended for the sequel instead. That's why there is no kiss to make Miss Lane forget Clark Kent's true identity in the 2006 version. In stead, Donner creates a very touching scene between the two lovers where Lois is the strong one who realizes she and the Man of Steel can never lead a normal life together and Superman is the one who shows weakness again and expresses his desire to still see his one true love only to have to come to terms with his selfishness once more and undo all that has happened. In the introduction, Richard Donner states that the 2006 cut is an idea of what Superman II could have been had he been allowed to finish the project and that is how this movie should be watched. Not as an improved sequel to the first film (the special effects are too incomplete for that), but as a version that sheds a new light on two legendary films and that thanks to Margot Kidder's and the public's incessant requests, has now finally been released for all the fans to enjoy.
0143034901|5.0|One of the best novels I have read in the past 10 years!

B00003CXPD|5.0|I bough this DVD for a friend and it was in perfect shape when i got it.
B000I0QK74|5.0|Awesome album - Christmas favorites done with typical Taylor treatment. Highly recommend this for any James Taylor fan!
0143035711|5.0|Chickenhawk? Yes, these men in their 20s both feared their missions and fought for them to the limits of what their harware allowed them to do, displaying incredible bravery. This story takes you in South-Vietnam and into the world of the Air Cavalry that distinguished brilliantly itself in this theater of operations. Reading this book tells even tricks to better fly the very much famed \\"Huey Chopper\\" under extreme conditions. This book is one of the very finest choice for the UH-1D engagement in SEA. Thank you so much Mr. R. Mason!
B000HBK3MM|5.0|A light, delightful, airy mix between NeoSoul and Pop.  Corrine Bailey Rae is a star on the rise and this album should be on everyone's top 10 for 2006.
B00001OH7U|5.0|I bought this album in the early 80's and could not find it on CD until recently. One of Bowie's lesser known works, but certainly not one of his lesser works. 'Wild is the Wind' is the Johnny Matthis song brought to a different universe -- a little goth, very moving and highly cool. Years ago, when I first heard this song on my car radio, I had to pull off the side of the road and reflect and absorb. I still can't get over Bowie's voice on this album (album -- the word dates me, no?) and his passion for the music. Love love love this album!
1577314808|5.0|An easy to follow guide on living in the present moment.  This book has changed my life!

1878424505|5.0|A great book with simple ways to live a more fulfilling life.  When you aren't getting caught up in what others think of you and you follow the 4 agreements, anything is possible. <br />
B000I5X81K|2.0|I loved his first two CDs but was disappointed in this one. It's quite a departure from the style that made him successful. None of the songs are ones I wanted to listen to over and over again. Nice attempt at creativity but it doesn't fly.
B00005JNS0|5.0|I really loved this movie.  I wasn't too sure about it but I am so glad that we bought it.  The cast of actors/actresses is just wonderful.  Our whole family enjoys watching it together and it's a laugh out loud kinda film. Mater is such a character! I really like the underlying story. This is one of those feel-good movies that will put a smile on your face everytime!
B0002Y69NG|5.0|This is a great set of movies and a really good price for everything that is included. CAses look sharp, although I wish they were hardcover cases that snapped shut rather than book-style cases.
B000GIWS7E|5.0|the quality, the recording and the performance are excellent. I am very pleased.
1592289444|4.0|The story was fascinating and hard to put down.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because several times during the story, I had a hard time believing certain events were true.  So when I finished the book, I googled the author and found that records discovered since his death indicate that at least some of this story (maybe a lot of it!) is pure fiction.  That was disappointing to find out because you're led to believe that it all really happened (even the title says \\"The TRUE Story of a Trek to Freedom\\").  But it's still an exciting and interesting book to read, and many people certainly walked vast distances during the war.
B000IU3Y1O|5.0|I went and saw Depeche Mode in Las Vegas and Salt Lake City last year and they are still the best ever.  The 80's still rock on :) This new CD is awesome.  Don't pass this one up!!!!
B000GFLAI0|4.0|Its good to see a great performer who can still write good songs and make excellent CDs (albums).
0060555661|4.0|I found the reading of this edition of the book to be very boring. I have not read any of the previous editions of the book, but I did find the book to be informative. I knew much of what was presented already, but it is a solid introductory book for readers wanting to discover the history of the stock market and different forms of investment. Throughout the book Graham preaches about which styles of investing to take which have he believes have shown to be successful, but I believe it us up to the reader(and Graham says the same) to identify what kind of investing style you will use and find what forms of investments you wish to use.  <br /> <br />This book may bore a young avid reader looking to find out more about investing, but it may help make you a more intelligent investor. A solid book if you don't know a lot of the ways to invest your money and advises on many ways that people invest their money that are too risky or a waste of time(such as annuities, IMO) but it also lacks information on many newer forms of investing that are being used today.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|This is vintage Beatles...I am always amazed by the freshness of their lyrics and their musicianship.....not just a pop band, but groundbreakers, these guys.......
B00005M91K|5.0|Beautiful in all of it's story telling and cinematography, this film is a one of a kind look into the mystery we all seek to understand from the sacred spirit that resides in all of creation. A truly breathtaking look at each of us on our own journey to find the sacred in ourselves and it's connection to something higher. The music is so compelling and the images so striking, this film is a must for every armchair artist and seeker of truth, beauty, and our connection to all of creation and the Creator.
B000JJ4GW0|3.0|First, the CD:  I already had all tracks on this except for the 2 new ones, and I am not the type to purchase another greatest hits just to have every product U2 puts out...but I got it for the DVD, which I will review below.  I wouldn't buy the CD for the 2 new songs, either.  Neither belong among U2 greatest tracks.  Basically the CD was the price of admission to see the DVD.    Now, the DVD: Definitely a HUGE improvement over the Chicago Vertigo performance.  It's too bad they didn't release the entire concert.  I wouldn't say it's one of their best DVD's, but I particularly enjoyed WOWY and OOTS, the final 2 tracks.    In summary, I would never buy the CD on its own, the DVD is decent, and requiring me to buy the CD and DVD together is a shameless ploy by SOMEONE (I won't go into who's really to blame here).  In hindsight, I'd say the DVD was marginally worth the sale price I paid for the package.
B000000OE7|5.0|Is this vintage Queen?....The answer is no, but it doesn't have to be vintage to be great. MIH is mainly soft rock songs mixed with some pop elements. I like every song on this album, and you can't even say that about some of Queens best efforts, It's  very consistent from beginning to end. My favorites are \\"made in heaven\\"  The last vocal performance from freddie \\"mother love\\" roger talyors sublime \\"heaven for everyone\\" and freddie's last written song \\"a winter tale\\" is simply one of my favorite songs ever, very moving. It truly is good music.
1586210912|5.0|I got alot out of this book. The Attitude of money and how important the way you use your wealth. Great message for the 20 somethings that spend money like the already have it.. <br />
B000000OAL|5.0|Queen's self titled album is their heaviest album they ever released.  Queen didn't fully develope their sound yet, but you could hear pieces like \\"my fairy king\\" or \\"liar\\" that hints of what's to come in future releases.  Freddie Mercury was an amazing songwriter in the early days and wrote such early metal pieces like \\"great king rat\\" along with brian mays solid songwriting in \\"keep yourself alive\\" makes this one of the best albums of their career. Only slightly behind \\"A night at the opera\\" and \\"Queen2.\\"

B00009TB5G|5.0|This movie is great and the extra scenes are an awesome addition to it.
1582701709|5.0|This has been one of the most inspiring DVD's I've ever watched.  I've started to use the techniques and recommendations and it's simply amazing how your perspective and results can manifest themselves in everyday life.  Thank you Rhonda Byrne for sharing it with the rest of us!
B000AGTPUA|5.0|This is a great movie to watch with your children after you've read them the book. Nothing can really compare to reading to & with children but the movie is very delightful.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I found Firefly by accident. I saw a later episode in the series on television, and I HAD to have more of the story.  The writing for Firefly is well done, plain and simple. You learn of each character slowly, and you like everyone for their own characteristics. It has a very funny, sly sense of humor. The characters all work well together and after watching each episode, I wanted to keep watching until I saw each and every one.  <br />I didn't care for Buffy, BUT- if you like Sci-fi with a western flair and witty dialogue, then try Firefly. It does have a campy quality, but it is a very good quality that adds to this series.  I'm sad it is not on television anymore- I guess there wasn't much of an audience for it. The movie Serenity is great- that goes without saying. The creator is very talented. Please make more of Firefly! :D
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|But being a hopeless romantic, I definitely loved it. The hopeless relationship on the doomed ship, was dramatic and sweetly pure. Even if you're not a fan of love stories, merely watch it for the beautiful recreation of a ship soon to be lost forever.
B00000I3JO|5.0|The only thing I can say is that my heart moves everytime I listen to this record. IT TOUCHES THE CORE OF MY HEART. <br />Thanks blue nile for this priceless and timeless album. I don't know how many times I have auditioned it, but not less than a hundred and everytime is like the first time. <br />love
032147404X|5.0|Excellent book, a \\"How to\\" book that gets results like the pros. <br />Secret tips & tricks that professions use, cuts through the details & get straight to the point. <br />Wish there was another book.
B00000I3JM|5.0|TINSELTOWN IN THE RAIN is for me one of my best 10 songs ever if not the first. Abosolutely a work of art. Moving and gorgeous. The rest of the album is one of my favorites by far. Together with HATS, both are those records I would take to a dessert island. <br />cheers

B00007KWHN|4.0|The album is all of the classics you hear on classic rock radio, and some in recent movies. Definetly worth aqquiring this remastered album with studio outakes.
0316066524|5.0|Don't let the length scare you! If you combine the total page numbers of the last three books you read, it probably adds up to about the same as Infinite Jest. So, just think of it as three books and plow through it. This novel is not as difficult or scary as it looks. There is humor on every page and it is very rewarding. The endnotes are a bit annoying, but you get used to it as you read on, and, as one reviewer already suggested, use two bookmarks.  <br /> <br />Be brave, and give it a try. You'll be glad you did. <br />
0446530573|4.0|As many others have mentioned you need to double check temps and in even some cases quantities or portions of ingredients. All in all I love this cookbook for many reasons, most of which is the way the recipes are presented. It is fun to read along some of the storylines as you browse for a new meal to make the family. I never had an Italian mother to compare these recipes to so I am not judging the book under pretense. But we grew up in an area with many fine Italian restaurants and how I miss those places. <br /> <br />This cookbook makes it fun on Sundays to recreate some of the favorites we used to \\"order out\\". Take this cook book with some levity and have fun while you cook, that's really what it's all about.
B000I5X81K|5.0|Josh Groban just never fails to please.  His voice is without compare.
0618680004|5.0|Dawkins thesis is a stunningly intelligent and logical presentation of his point-of-view.  Aside from the merits of his arguments, or lack thereof, I find the work a dramatic affirmation of this nation's (and, indeed, all nation's) proclaimation of freedom of thought.  Further, I find the book a well-done condemnation not so much of religion but rather a somewhat hypocritical \\"shunning\\" of most of us of the position of one with whom we might not agree.  I would be delighted to spend an evening over beer and true argument with a person like Professor Dawson; I think it would be good for testing my own beliefs.  I recommend this work highly; it provokes, true.  But, more important, it demands recognition and thought.  I find it a powerful work demanding respect for the athiest point-of-view and for freedom of thought as a whole.

B000GRUS22|4.0|This is yet another offering in the caliber you would expect Enigma to produce.  it is good.  Very good in fact, but I find it lacking in originality.  It is predictable and comfortable for fans who want more of the same, but seems to have fallen into that programmed numbness in some places.  Enigma has stopped experimenting and settled into the tried and true.  So if you are looking for more of the same and love that, this is a great choice.  If you are looking for new directions in creativity from Enigma, you won't get it.  It is a good album.
0967984602|5.0|If you are serious about building a wood-fired oven, but do not want the expense & effort, this is the book for you.  I was seriously considering a brick oven, but found this book.  The subject is covered thoroughly & makes the effort simplistic.

The illustrations bring to life a story that is touching, imaginative and provides entertainment for all children, both male and female.   The presentation of the book itself captures your attention with great use of colours which is continued throughout the book. The wonder and delight that this book has provided for my niece and nephew allows us as adults to see childhood innocence and wonder at its best.

0937381888|5.0|Much like brewing itself, you can make this book as complicated as you want to get. Whether you are starting with extract, partial mash, or all-grain this book is full of information from tips to water chemistry. Palmer definitely takes a different approach than Papazian, but I would argue that both books are essential in every brewers library.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Why they canceled this series I have no idea.  Fantastic sci-fi with no 2 dimentional characters.  Very well written, a must see before you watch the movie serenity (which is essentially what would have been the shows 2nd season compressed down into a movie)
0679736646|5.0|Ubik is a good book, very dynamic, you begin reading it and it surrounds you in a craving for read it all. At the beging I though it was the typical Sci Fi book but the history tack unthinkable paths. A book to recommend for sure. <br />

B00008L3U1|4.0|I find this to be one of the finest Robin Williams dramatic/comedic performance. I enjoyed it immensely. Robin Williams portrays Jack Powell, a boy who suffers from a disease that ages him 4 times faster than normal. Just image a 10 year old boy with the body of a 40year old & with the comedy of Robin Williams! School is really a hassle!
069452607X|3.0|I appreciate the scientific approach that the author used to determine what really works in successful businesses.  I thought the myth-busting - my words, not his - was interesting and useful.  However, I can't say that I was able to apply much of it to my own business.  This is mostly due to the fact that I am a part of a very small startup company.  The descriptions are a bit abstract like most formal business books and I don't like that about it.  Overall, it's worth a few listens.
B000065BPB|4.0|Sound quality is excellent as others have said - and it is a great deal for the $$, but the band eventually cracks and will break over time. I have used these for 2 years as a DJ bringing them from gig to gig in a bag, so I expect wear+tear, but the cracking seems to be simply because the type of plastic can't handle the strain put on it by the inner metal band - not a problem caused by banging it around, but mostly from folding it and unfolding it into the \\"collapsed\\" position. I can still wear mine - but a number of large chunks of plastic have broken off the band. Somehow it hasn't broken completely...
0743454537|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It was chosen as the book our entire county should read this year.  It was not only an interesting story which involved ethical questions, but there were surprising situations that appeared throughout the novel, especially at the end. <br /> <br />I do question about younger people reading this because of some of the content.
B00000JY1X|5.0|Not since Cole Porter has music of such high caliber been written for the masses...i look forward to future works by Mr. Stephen Merritt.
B0000C8AW5|4.0|Bob Dylan's throw-aways are as good as most songwriters ever write.  I enjoy Planet Waves more than I did thirty years ago.  Some classics, \\"Forever Young\\", \\"Hazel\\".  The Band's playing is complex and interesting.  The storm clouds gather for Blood On The Tracks.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|If you liked Who Killed the Electric Car you will love this film...okay, it may depress you to listen to and watch Gore, the man was REALLY voted in as president.  I felt so sad at the end of the film knowing that Bush has done so much damage in the name of OIL and GREED, and we could have had this thoughtful, intelligent (so not a C student in college like Bush) and articulate man, something the White House is sorely missing, a president who is articulate! But I digress...Gore gives various presentations with scientific facts, figures, and graphics that put Global Warming in perspective. It is real folks.  How much longer are we going to wait to make our government get tough on pollution?  Gore is amazing.  You must see this.
B000FQ4M58|5.0|This 3rd Bat at of Hell Album is a great finish to the Trilogy.  Buy it, you'll love it.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|I bought this item cause i do personally think as this movie as the best feature film i've ever seen. I've seen it at least 7 times and every time i find something new and exciting. The product case is not awesome but still very decent. I recommend anyone to own this jewel.
B000I5X81K|5.0|Typical Josh Groban. Great.  Great sound, great songs, great voice.
B00007GZR5|4.0|This film was for years my favorite one, that's why i decided to own the original DVD, but for some reason they didn't think about making a more fair presentation for this movie. I think this is the kind of products that deserve a double DVD and sleeve book. I hope sometime a deluxe edition will be released.
0618680004|5.0|If you're the kind of person who has been thinking about the existence of an entity that we refer to as \\"God\\", doubtless you might have come across many arguments for and against the same.  <br /> <br />I have been an agnostic leaning towards atheism for a long time now, but this book by Dawkins is simply mindblowing.. very cogent, and well explained, it takes away a lot of the questions you had and convinces you by the sheer logic of his arguments.. A must buy!!
1582701709|1.0|I thought it was over and over the same. Think what you want in life is basically all it said, through out. I, actually burned it in my fire place.!!!!! It felt very new age and very God, Less. I am a open minded Christian and I did not see God in any of it. I beleive God has a plan for our life and I think the Purpose Driven Life is a much better book to read !!!!
076781214X|5.0|i have been looking for this dvd for a few years(i was told it would not be produced again)what a great find!
B000AADYRQ|3.0|If you are planning to buy or have bought this album, please do long-term fans a favor and buy Death Cab's other albums. Plans is one of the most musically inarticulate albums the band has released. Sure the songs are pretty nice when compared to the junk on the radio. But if you go back and listen to any albums released under Barsuk, such as The Photo Album and Transatlanticism, Plans is simply not as good as fans know a DCfC album can be. It's not a bad album. But Ben Gibbard has done better, and hopefully will in the future.
B000JBXXZ4|3.0|It didn't win over as the other albums did (Make Yourself, ACLOTM)..But of course, they're always Incubus :)
B000F8O35U|4.0|The Little Mermaid is my first Disney cartoon. This DVD brings me not only the teasurable memory but also more polished pictures. The extra bonus interview behind the scenes help me know more about the production of the cartoon. And the bonus cartoon is also touching.

0688103111|3.0|In the early 1970s, when he was twenty, Bryson left Iowa for a summer of wandering around Europe. He enjoyed it so much, he did it again the next summer. Then he actually moved to England and took up residence in his career as a journalist, though he somehow didn't manage to see much more of the Continent. Twenty years after his first wanderjahr, he had a hankering to do it yet again, hitting as many of the original sights as possible, just to compare notes with his earlier self. The result is a sometimes witty, sometimes annoying tale of a middle-aged monolingual man's impressions of what happened to the Europe he first fell in love with, but which was discovered by American capitalism in the interim. Starting in Hammerfest, the northernmost town in Europe (he wanted to view the northern lights), he makes his way in fits and starts through Scandinavia in the early Spring (which he doesn't much like), Paris (which he loves though he doesn't much care for the people who actually live there), the Low Countries (Amsterdam isn't what it was), back to Copenhagen and Stockholm (mostly expensively disappointing), and finally to Rome by plane because he missed the sun. He loves the Eternal City, Capri, and Italy generally, with the exception of Milan (which apparently isn't Italian enough). He loves the scenery in Switzerland but doesn't care much for the Swiss. He doesn't particularly approve of Zurich or Geneva, either. And he makes it clear several times that German is a funny-sounding language and that German menus are dangerous to order from because you never know what weird dish you might get. He seems to like Yugoslavia, mostly because of its primitiveness and because it isn't crammed with tourists -- and he really dotes on Sofia, which is just strange. On the other hand, he doesn't like Istanbul at all.<br /><br />Bryson is the sort of traveler who actually enjoys wandering by himself through a strange town, not understanding a word anyone says, not knowing the local mores. Apparently, he likes being a stranger -- The Other. I prefer knowing what I'm doing, understanding what's happening, appreciating what I'm looking at. I hate discovering, six months after returning home, that there was someplace I would have made every effort to visit, had I only known it was there. Anyway. Though he can be amusing, Bryson comes across as a bit of an Ugly American. Or Ugly Adopted Yorkshireman, or whatever. He tends to make wisecracks based on ignorance, such as making fun of the fact that Norway (in 1991) required motorists to drive with their headlights on, even in the sunniest weather. He considers this not only pointless but \\"surreal\\" -- although the practice now, fifteen years later, is widely recommended in the U.S. and (yes) required by law in some areas. So much for European backwardness.l mores. Apparently, he likes being a stranger -- The Other. I prefer knowing what I'm doing, understanding what's happening, appreciating what I'm looking at.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|A must see for any citizen of the Earth. Will change your mind on Glabla warming. Al Gore does an excellent job
0452281881|5.0|All the - all too true - advertising cliches presented masterly in a innovative format.  Probably almost as funny for non-advertising people.  A great light read.
B00005OWEG|5.0|This is an extended verssion of the original Apocalypse now version that was edited.This is great to see the rest of the movie.By it you will love it.
B00005LC1H|5.0|The reason I purchased this DVD is John Cleese, as he is the best comedian <br />for slapstick and keeps me in stiches laughing. Anyway a good few hours spent with good clean comedy.
B000068CNX|5.0|Hey ya'll, <br /> <br />These are definitely classics...I know they're showing them on television (syndication) like CRAZY ...but you know...some of it is SOOOOOOO funny, you can't help but watch. <br /> <br />Good luck!
0060254920|5.0|This was a marvelous book when my son was little, his children, and it's now in the hands of my youngest grandson.  A wonderful book for reading to and being read to.  Full of good scarey!  It stimulates lots of imagination.  I plan on giving it to my great-grandson when he's old enough!  Also wonderful for girls, but the boys really enjoy the growling when you read to them.
B00004VVNB|5.0|A good way to judge the quality of a movies special effects, is by seeing how many other movies rob their footage.  I don't know how many times I've seen the Domes and City from Logan's Run used in lesser movies - I've lost count.  The sets and costume design are amazing, bringing about a vision of the future second-to-none.  The props maintain their futuristic appeal, even today.  The Sandman gun, in particular, with its unusual flare and effect, is an impressive example of the prop-masters art.  The storyline:  a futuristic world where nobody lives past the age of 35.  In a carvival atmosphere, they are \\"renewed,\\" while the crowd cheers on.  Some people don't believe in renewal, and seek \\"sanctuary,\\" they are called \\"runners.\\"  These runners are hunted by sandmen (police), and killed.  Michael York, plays Logan 5, a sandman who is forced to rethink his opinions on renewal and seek sanctuary.  I wont spoil the story any more, for those who haven't seen this epic, but I will say that the plot leads out of the domes into a strange (yet familiar) world.  Enjoy the show!
B00005V9IK|5.0|I bought this from an affiliate of Amazon.  It was the first time I did so, but it was a smooth process- better then e-bayers!  Movie was perfect
074356619X|5.0|I've been shaken by a few things in my life - when I first read what Jesus said in a red-letter bible, later when I read Krishnamurti's words, and still later when I read Conversations with God by Neal Donald Walsch - all of those are ingrained in my being/psyche forever. But this movie, this idea, presented by the foremost scientists/humanists/psychologists of the 21st century, WILL BLOW YOUR MIND.  If you have any interest at all in changing, in learning what is really going on in our universe - this is for you.  It's all about the LAW OF ATTRACTION - something quite useful to understate it like that - and I'm every day thinking of this and every day using this knowledge.  My life is totally changed.  I will never be the same.  RUN AND GET THE MOVIE.  It is hard to find in mainstream but if you dig around you can get it.  P.S.  There are two versions.  One has Esther Hicks (who channels Abraham) on the video, and one does not.  There was some problem with contracts.  I didn't care if I had the version with her in it or not.  I value Esther and Abraham but the material stands without her.  GO GET IT.
B0000A1HQP|5.0|This is a film made from an original French play.Most,if not all the action takes place in a single room.The beginning of the film is a bit slow but,when all the characters are assembled on the stage the action starts.The humour is very European and one must play close attention to the conversations to understand and appreciate it all.So if you want to spend a couple of ours in front of the tube and enjoy really humorous aand witty exchanges and good character acting then this is the movie for you.I have enjoyed it and have watched it a number of times and so have some of my friends.The film is certainly a \\"buy\\"for your collection.
1400082773|5.0|I was completly satisfied with the book which was received.  The condition was as advertised and the price fair.
B00005JN0T|4.0|This movie isn't trying to invent the wheel, but they can't all do that and we still need some good movies to watch.  My kid and I love this one.
0060566108|3.0|A lot of good information, found the early parts of the book a bit long-winded. I found myself skipping the 'how we arrived at this conclusion' parts to get to the information I was looking for.
B000AYEL1A|5.0|I have been a fan of this movie since I was a child.  I grew up on these songs, characters and this amazing, tragic story.  The movie quality was so much better than I had expected.  They did a great job of remastering this movie.  The sound is incredible.  There are also actual special features.  I didn't figure they would go through the trouble.  They rarely do with these older movies.  It was nice to listen to the commentary with Barbra Streisand and see some of the raw footage of the wardrobe tests.  If you know and love this movie you should own this for sure.  If you have never seen it, but love Barbra or Kris buy it now.  You will be a fan for life.  If you just want a great story with great music, you should buy this and thank me later.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|No, this is not \\"Fallen\\", but somtimes I like to listen to music when I don't feel like crying my eyes out.  It is still Evancscence, but not quite as deep and dark.  However, Amy's beautiful voice still comes thru, and for all you darkside lovers, there is track #8.
B0007939NO|5.0|Great DVD.  Good quality.  Packaged well and shipped promptly. Good customer service.
B00006D295|5.0|Flash back to my teens! And of course, a Rocky party with everyone in character is always a hit (at least with my generation).
B00006DEF9|5.0|Excellent DVD.  Classic.  Bought for a Christmas gift and could not part with it.  Packaged well and shipped promptly. <br />
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I gave this movie wrapped with an energy saver light bulb to friends and family for the holidays and have received rave reviews.  It's a great family movie and several said their families viewed it 2 or 3 times.  I plan to buy more as gifts to help spread an essential message.  Older kids and young adults get it best- there's hope in the next generation! Whether or not you like Al Gore is not the point- get over it if need be and get informed before it's too late.
B00005MP58|5.0|Bought this for my wife for Christmas.  Worth every penny.  Will probably watch annually.
B000HCO83Q|5.0|I received the DVD quicker than I expected and it was in excellent condition. Keep up the good work!
1878424319|5.0|Brilliant book, first chapters have a bit of excess theory but hang in there - those 4 agreements are really worth learning and living.  Also worth looking at all the agreements you live by but have never thought about, and if you read this and then Covey's '7 habits..' then you might even change your life !
B0000E5NPZ|5.0|I enjoyed this DVD with Jean Seberg. It is an older movie with a contemporary currency; it is hilariously funny, stylish and worthwhile.
0446528056|5.0|I continue to be amazed at the sensitive writings of this young author-it seems this story is no less sensitive to the human heart than his previous readings. I believe Sparks must be getting his emotion for writing from life experiences, I really enjoyed this book!
0307010856|5.0|This book is awesome. I loved it when I was little and now love reading it to my kids. Great buy.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Very interesting, educational. I have become aware of many dangers and more concerned about the future of the planet.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|This series is great!  I bought this set for my wife and we both love it.  I recommend this box set for any fans of the show.
B000FTWB7G|4.0|I loved their first album, and I would say that at first listening this was not something I was fond of. Yet the more I listened to it the more I enjoyed the music. The songs are have a certain etherial hold on a person once they nestel in the back of the mind; haunting the ears and tickling the imagination at the very edges. <br />It's a good album to give a chance to, I would say if you are unsure of purchasing to go to Evenescence's website a few various times and listen to the tracks; you might not like it right away but it does grow on a person after the third or fourth listen through and than it sticks.
B00005JO9J|5.0|Great!! The DVD was in perfect condition, came very quickly and was a great Christmas gift for my friend.  Also very modest on price.  Thanks!
B000H5V8DG|5.0|My wife is a big Alias fan. Our local TV stations are unpredictable about showing some programs. This really was a blessing and made a great gift. Thanks.
B000JLQSQU|5.0|It's hard to find music like this. It's a little like a film score, but it doesn't really sound like there is supposed to be a visual accompaniment like those often do. Really beautiful piano playing, at times very melancholy, without ever sounding pretentious or cheesy. I could easily imagine drinking a bottle of good wine and staring at the ceiling on a rainy evening to this.
B000FIMG68|5.0|Love the show, Love the dvd's.  Great buy for lost fans.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|Not as heavy as some of their prior stuff, but excellent consistent sound throughout the entire record.  I play this over and over and have yet to tire of it.
B000244FDW|5.0|Of all versions of Pride and Prejudice I've seen, this is far and away my favorite. The four-hour format gives more time to really tell the story than a traditional movie. All of the characters are wonderfully cast and played. And in particular, that most important and pivotal character, Mr. Darcy, is perfect. This character needs to be drop-dead gorgeous and as aristocratic as he**, and none of the more recent portrayals have come close to Rintoul's. <br /> <br />I love Pride and Prejudice, and have owned this version on VHS since it was first offered. I danced for joy when I discovered it was available on DVD.
B00005MP58|5.0|My daughter-in-law has wanted this DVD for a long time and was thrilled when she received it as a Christmas gift.  Wonderful version of this classic!
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|The best DVD set I've ever purchased. An incredible Dire Straits Sultans of Swing version, Tom Petty is fantastic, as is David Bowie & Queen.  Too many hits to describe. <br /> <br />Just great.
B000F8O35U|5.0|Not only is this a wonderful story, but the colorful underwater action and some of the great songs make it one of my very favorites, even though I am an adult.  And the characters have such personality! I love singing along with it, it's just a very FUN movie!
0064430227|5.0|We've read this story out loud a hundred times at least... And I love it, too -- the way one thing leads to another and another... Lots of little play-on-words that the kids won't necessarily get... \\"He drew up the covers\\" at the end... Love that.  We have several of the other purple crayon series, but this is truly the best.
B0002S943O|5.0|si eres un verdadero fan de la banda, esta pieza no te debe faltar. Definitivamente, una pieza exquisita de musica y pressentacion audiovisual en vivo.
B00005K9QP|5.0|he can't do a bad one!!  and this is the original end all be all british blues group!!!
B000BTC5LW|5.0|If you never got to see Pink Floyd, you won't.  You'll just have to buy a video.  I had Pulse in VHS and obviously it's much better in DVD form.  This was from the last Floyd tour and was a great show.  Killer lighting, great sound quality.  This is a must for every Floyd fan.
B000AYEL1A|5.0|If you are a fan of this version, the DVD is a dream come true.  It is a spectacular transfer.  The sound and the video are incredible.  Barbara gives an enlightening commentary.  The deleted scenes are great.
B00000K3CR|5.0|I bought this for my daughter as a Christmas present, we have owned the VHS tape for years and she has worn it out.<br /><br />What can I say, great classic movie about growing up to fast, great transfer to DVD.<br /><br />Everything I expected it to be.
1932100660|5.0|I counsel cancer patients every day.  My advice is a radical change in their diets and a variety of supplements to reverse their cancer.  It works for most of them.  I am not a doctor, just a \\"reporter.\\"  This book completely validated with well designed and long-term scientific studies what I had been telling the cancer patients for the last 6 years.  Their experience confirms Dr. Campbell's conclusions.  Once they avoid sugar, processed food, animal protein, dairy and gluten they get well.  That leaves them with a \\"raw, whole vegetable\\" salad or two along with a mixture of cottage cheese and flaxseed oil as their diet. There is no question that the \\"whole food, plant-based\\" diet described by Dr. Campbell insures both prevention and healing of virtually all degenerative conditions, certainly including cancer. I recommend every cancer patient I counsel read this book and take its message to heart.  Of course, I recommend you do, too.

B000FGFSPG|5.0|This set is really amazing! The music is everything that I have come to know by Nightwish... The concert DVD Rocks and the extra features are alot of fun. The only thing I would have liked is if there had been a few of the earlier songs either in teh concert or on the CDs. Great!!!!!
B000HT3PPG|5.0|My wife and I have been married for 48 years and spend time each Christmas season watching the Christmas movies that have been a part of many years. We find that this activity keeps memories fresh and the Season meaningful.  Our children (now in their 40's) are finding the same excitement.  Thank the Lord that the films, etc., are still available.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|Excellent Movie.  Never liked westerns too much.  This one is great
B00005ASIL|5.0|If you ever heard Jethro Tulls Auqualung, and enjoyed the musical tallents in that song, you should buy The Very Best of Jethro Tull; it certainly has the best of his music you'll find, all on one CD
B000IZJZLM|5.0|I usually listen to this CD a couple of times a day because the music is so beautiful and it still manage to thrill me each time I listen to it. I really enjoyed the DVD on the other side, and getting to know more about them. There's only a couple other Il Divo CDs out ~~ I wish there was more. Can't get enough Il Divo.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|What a set of movies! I have searched for years to find the colorized version of the Original \\"Miracle on 34th Street\\". I couldn't find it anywhere. I love the black-and-white version, too. This great set has BOTH. I've enjoyed it throughout the season and lent it out to friends for their viewing pleasure and will do that again for years to come. Best buy I have ever made online and Amazon makes the purchase so easy anymore. The remake is a good try - but - you cannot beat this original version of this great movie.
B0007Y4USW|5.0|Amazing music. Great songs. Splendid voice. One of the most beautiful albums of her career, that proves once again the talent and amazing vocality of Ms. Carey. A must have!
B000I0QL82|5.0|Holiday Inn is a great movie I remember as child. My father used to watch this movie when I was growing up. I introduced my husband to it last year and he just loved it and had to have it this year. He was thrilled to get the special edition with the bonus features.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I purchased this set for my husband for Christmas.  I couldn't have found a more perfect gift if I had searched all year.  He is a tremendous fan of the series and was truly thrilled to have ALL of it.  We have been watching an episode here and there since Christmas and have enjoyed every minute - both of us.
0618680004|3.0|I liked this book, but there are a coup0le things that should be said. As an atheist myself, I agree with the viewpoint of this book, but not the tone. Personally, I think that the main problem that religion has given us is intolerance of other beliefs. Therefore, since this book attacks religion, it simply perpetuates that problem, rather than facing it. Dawkins is a brilliant guy and his arguments are persuasive. However the underlying problem is that he refuses to accept the fact that other people might not think the same as him.<br /><br />And the inclusion of the Douglas Adams quote at the beginning annoys me. Adams is probably turning over in his grave to be associated with a book that is intolerant as this one. Yes, he was an atheist, but he never attacked the belief systems of other people - he tried to understand them.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|The DVD was in good shape and I received it quickly. I was very pleased with the transaction.
B000FTWB7G|2.0|I love this cd If you like Evenescence  you will like this one .
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This is a must see movie for everyone, young and old. The scientific facts of where we are headed with global warming are irrefutable. It's time for everyone to take responsibility for global warming and become proactive. The movie shows over and over with scientific data the history of the earth and how it has changed dramatically recently. This is not about politics, it's about our future. I bought a copy for my family and one for my daughter's school. This should be part of school curricculum. See the movie and tell your friends, family and educators.
1400064287|5.0|Try this - Read the introduction and the first chapter and tell a friend what the book is about.  If you're anything like me, you'll realize that you've miraculously absorbed virtually every \\"sticky\\" example given along with the reasoning and methodology, without even thinking about it.  The book practices its own preaching, making it not only everything you'd hope for in a book of this nature, but living proof that it works.  Its very form supports its message, all the way down to the fluorescent orange, textured cover.  Absolutely LOVED it.
0618680004|3.0|Richard Dawkins writes above my intellectual level.  But, that which I do understand, makes me wonder why so many people don't use critical thinking. I know the answer.  But, still, I wonder.
B000IOM0YM|4.0|The box set is a fantastic way to show how good they were in the early days. I like all sorts of different stages of Kiss' evolution, but to see them play live in 75 at San Francisco's Winterland was a real treat. Anyone who has a problem with Peter's drumming, watch it here - this is what he was like before the drugs completely took over. <br />There are also extras like the first ever live shot of them playing at the Coventry, and again at Ace's wedding. Being from England, I also like the tv show that covered their first tour here in 1976. <br />The only reason I have gone for 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the typical way that they marketed it. Amazon had a bonus disc of Madison Sq Gdn, Walmart had Largo, and Best Buy had another show. So typical of Kiss these days to bleed their loyal fans dry.
0307275639|5.0|This is a wonderful book, full of life lessons we can all learn from! I am sure I will re-read it over and over again!
B0000DBJDM|1.0|I was expecting a concert video, and instead got a talk about the making of an art piece by this name. There is not one complete song, and I felt I wasted my money.

B000BTC5LW|5.0|I was blown away by the quality and quantity of the music, and the visuals were astounding! <br />I cannot say enough good about this DVD! <br />
1427200246|4.0|Ah, the latest tool selected by the President of the company I work for.  Was used in a presentation to upper management, but I figured I'd better check it out.  As I learned from my experience with \\"The 360 Degree Leader: Developing Your Influence from Anywhere in the Organization\\", these kinds of books are better as CDs.  Great for the commute, especially on the way into work to get you in the mindset.
B00003CXIP|4.0|I was raised in Beaverton Oregon during the 1940s and 1950s much like the scenery in the movie. Four friends and I made many trips acros a high train trestle. In one instance we also had to run acrross ahead of atrain. We also threw clods of dirt at a shack occupied by Hobos and were consequently cahesed by them - we escaped by commnadering an ungarded two hand pump rail car. <br /> <br />The movie was well made with good acting.
0194001067|4.0|It is very useful product and very user friendly.  I had some problems with first instalation but now it is working well.
0792839749|5.0|There is really nothing to say, this classic is just that...A CLASSIC
0195170776|5.0|I am a writer with two offices away from home and homes in two cities in which I have offices.  It is imperative that I have the best dictionary possible at hand at all times.  For me, that is The New Oxford American Dictionary.
B00005JO1R|5.0|Saying I'm addicted is no exaggeration because I have watched this movie, or some portion of it, ever since I purchased this film.  I cannot say enough about the performances of Joaquin and Reese.  How he missed out on the Oscar is still bewildering to me.  In the 'special' section of the DVD you can hear James Mangold narrate the entire movie while it is running in the background.  You will learn so much about the actors themselves, Johnny Cash and the movie making industry itself.  My son wants to send me to the Betty Ford Clinic and my daughter-in-law suggested Blockbuster for a possible support group.  Funny stuff but it hasn't stopped me from watching!
B000H5U832|5.0|kids of all ages will love it.  Don't forget to watch the credits.  They are a hoot with the outtakes.
B000JK8OYU|3.0|Normally the good people of Amazon are pretty reliable reviewers.  So I trusted them on this one.  But I'm just not feeling all of these raving, 5-star, absolute-classic reviews here.    It is the Beatles, which is single-handedly, the greatest source of music you could ever have.  And it is legendary producer George Martin.  And it has the respectable \\"Cirque du Soleil\\" name on it too.  So a promising start...    But when you get into it, \\"Love\\" is not much more than a Beatles-Only Playlist for your mp3 player.  I truly expected waaay more - something edgier, something way more controversial.  Something that would have fans of the originals screaming bloody murder.    I would love for them to open up the vaults and let some real DJ/producers have free reign at remixing their catalog.  If you're familiar with the Verve Remixed jazz projects, that would be a starting place.  Or even track 13, \\"Strawberry Fields Forever,\\" is the one track that I felt really captured a fresh new look at the music.    I was hoping for something truly mind-blowing, genre-shattering here - such as DJ Z-Trip's \\"Uneasy Listening\\", or even a simple remix like The Killer's \\"Mr. Brightside\\" - but it just wasn't there.    On the other hand, my wife loved this cd, and she's definitely more of a mainstream music fan than I am.
B000I5X81K|5.0|Josh follows his previous work with some very insightful songs. Extremely easy to listen to.
B000002O1Q|5.0|Fast service.  Exactly what I paid for.  In mint condition.
B000B7HZXM|5.0|I have all four of the songbooks and love them all.
0694003611|5.0|What's to say, the kids love it and it's a nice bedtime story.  A classic...
0307120007|5.0|This is a very sweet, interactive book for very young kids. Both my boys loved it and wore out a copy, so I bought a replacement. Each page asks the kids to do something very simple, just like the kids in the book. This was one of my boys' favorite books, and they would \\"read\\" through it on their own many times.
9707704667|3.0|I have to admit I was a little bit disappointed with this book, it feels like the same situation keeps repeating throughout the whole book. The characters don't change or evolved, even after 20 years have passed.
B0002VL0KQ|5.0|Another great compilation By Celine, this album is great, I play it to my grandaughter at bedtime, and we, the adults listen to it anytime. Truly a masterpiece
0471267554|5.0|The book brings forward the thinking on diets by looking to our past primitive diets. It advanced for me the concept of acid/alkaline balances and omega 3 to omega 6 fat ratios.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|This is a movie to be enjoyed by all every year.  It is a heart warming story that can be watched again and again.  We always watch it around the Christmas holidays and have given it to many as a gift.
B00008PC2O|1.0|Do not buy this product for use in the UK, the HD part will not work from a location outside of the USA, it requires internet access to authenticate your license to view, if this is outside the US then it will not work. <br /> <br />If you have a Multi region player the standard DVD will work fine, it is only the Computer Media that require WMV-HD auth. <br /> <br />
B000F3AAUW|2.0|Ok, maybe I'm getting old (I resisted saying maybe I'm crazy) but there are only 2 good songs on this CD. Go thou to I-tunes.
B00000K2VZ|5.0|Incredible sound. Vocals cut to the soul and tear at the heart. Way before her time yet pulled along music from the past. Blues, rock and funk all rolled into one. No match living or dead! <br />
076781326X|5.0|Despite my 5 year olds (yes, twins) being way past their bed time, they were riveted and watched the movie to the very end; usually they'd fall asleep...<br /><br />Highly recommended as one of the best must-see family movies ever!!
B00005MP58|1.0|I would like to review the actual product but I never received this order.  There was a problem with super saving shipping.  The Amazon customer service rep indicated this order would be reshipped to a different address.  Instead the order was cancelled.  Overall impression of Amazon's process and results in addressing customer issues is POOR.
0784011680|1.0|I don't understand why everyone's giving this movie rave reviews!  The actings horrible, the film's dragged out, and the cliche's pile up so high that I couldn't even see the movie at the very end!  When I watched the part of \\"Chaplin\\" sitting in his sofa with a glass of wine contemplating how he could help the common man I wanted to throw up and laugh out loud at the same time -- not a good combination. <br /> <br />To reiterate:   <br />1) Bad, wooden acting <br />2) Dragged out storyline <br />3) Bad plot (hard to tell what's going on at times) <br />4) Unimaginable amount of cliche's  <br /> <br />Stay away from this movie.

B00005CDNI|5.0|Any purchaser who enjoys ABBA will enjoy Voulez-vous.  My favorites on this CD are \\"Angel Eyes,\\" and \\"Voulez-vous.\\"  ABBA had a certain type of fans - those of us who loved them in their hey day and still listen to their music now because it never ages.
B000000OE7|3.0|i bought this on amazon for $3.99! good album. i would at least rank it to be as good as innuendo ,a kind of magic and the miracle(if you like those albums like i do). but nowhere as good as the classics, sheer heart attack, news of the world, the game, and even 1984. the most boring tracks are the last two 'bonus' tracks...boring stuff.
B00005JNS0|5.0|The graphics, the music, the humor, the storyline, all appeal to the inner child in us, especially those who like cars, and racing. This is a keeper.  Later, 'Mater. So cute!
0553382179|5.0|Who would have thought that shining your sink could change your outlook on life?  It's interesting to me that the book doesn't tell you how to change your life, just to put on your shoes every morning!  This is not a literary masterpiece or a new interpretation of The New Testament.  It was written by an ordinary woman, with ordindary life problems that can be overwhelming.  There are some recognizable catchwords and familiar philosphies, but it is her application of those principals in a way that nearly anyone human can relate to without shame, guilt or any of those other feelings that come with ordinary, human shortcomings.  The surprise here is that the book demonstrates a way to relate to your children as an example about work, self-love, family, and community life in a positive, life affirming, \\"we're just learning\\", \\"we all make mistakes\\", \\"today's a new day\\" way.  After all, they learn by watching us.
0887307280|5.0|Michael Gerber has done a great job in explaining why 10 out of 12 small businesses fail within 2 years after they're opened. This is an easy read that contains insightful and practical messages for business owners. There are three components to a business (technician, manager, entrepreneur). The problem with most businesses is they focus most of their time on the technical component of the business. Gerber uses a woman who bakes pies to illustrate. She may feel that since she makes the best pies in town, this will drive masses of people through the door. The problem is that couldn't be farther from the truth! Sales and Marketing bring customers to your business. This is part of the entrepreneurial hat the business owner must also wear. E-Myth is fantastic so if you want to decrease your chances of becoming a statistic, I recommend purchasing this book ASAP!<br /><br />Dr. Matthew J. Loop<br /><br />- Author of \\"Cracking the Cancer Code\\"
1416524800|5.0|I purchased this book for my daughter for Christmas.  She has read all of his books except this one.  She said it was very good reading.
0060794410|5.0|Author does a fantastic job as the reader of his book. Insight and reflection of the changes given since the print of the book were priceless. Well worth the money and time.
B000EYK4KI|3.0|I felt this one showed more about their marriage. But the end fight scene lacked the original romance that the rated version had, simply by eliminating the background music. Its amazing what a simple music score change can do to a movie. However, this will remain one of my all time favorite movies. Sex, romance, and violence all rolled up into one. What more could a woman ask for?
B000001GBJ|3.0|This is a nice Cd. Its a combination of New Age & Celtic music. <br />I'll often play it when I'm looking for pieces of music to help <br />elliviate the steel bands of high stress. If I have had difficulty <br />sleeping its soothing enough for me to use that will help to  <br />start shutting internal systems off.
B000EOTAM6|4.0|I saw this in the movies and HAD to buy it. I loved the animated shorts on MTV and felt compelled to watch it. I loved it. It was beautiful and the action scenes were good. I felt that this is what would happen if a woman created an action movie and sure enough it was a woman director. I would love to see more movies like this.
0060254920|5.0|This book is and always will be a superb choice for children (& adults too)
B000H305U0|5.0|I felt like I was in the recording studio and really feeling what a huge project this was.  He brought SEXY back.<br /><br />Lucky Cameron.
B00007AJGH|4.0|Who framed Roger Rabbit is a must see. One of the greatest and more entertaining film of the ighties. This edition looks really good and has some interesting extras. I would have loved a little more insight in the creation process, but I'm nitpicking. <br />I strongly recommend it.
B000099T2L|5.0|I played the first one so much, I had to buy it again.<br /><br />Dangerously in love is still my favorite.<br /><br />Thanks B.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|Amazon was the only place I could get this movie, fast service, my husband was thrilled to receive this movie.
B000002BQK|5.0|I had the tape and the CD of this one, had to get it AGAIN.  I can't play this enough.  The cover of Prince's Beautiful Ones is amazing.  She blends so well with all the people she collaberates with.
0385510454|5.0|All the reviews I've read on the book were accurate!! This means that this is the best book John Grisham wrote yet.
B0007GAERG|5.0|The good way.  I've been a fan since 1989 and she continues to amaze me with THAT VOICE.  I could never get tired of hearing her.  She is truely a talented lady.<br /><br />Don't believe the hype.
B0000AQS6R|5.0|An awesome movie, a Christmas classic. Everyone should see this at least once every Christmas season!
0765315246|4.0|John Scalzi's Old Man's War is a fast moving, original and entertaining space opera of the military-science fiction genre.  While the story has sufficient philosophical content to keep you interested (consciousness transfer between bodies), action-adventure is the predominant theme.  I enjoyed it, and I would recommend it to readers to military sci-fi.
B0000DZ3IG|4.0|Perfect for the mellow days. Tons of great songs plus the good romantic ones too. If you like the movie, you'll like this CD.
B000002UB3|4.0|CD came in when promised (actually before) and was in great shape.
B000JJS8TM|4.0|I would have given this product 5 stars because the music composition and arrangement and its correspondence to the Cirque was just phenomenal.  I have never heard this type of arrangement before with the Beatles library of music and it was very interesting.  I love listening to it.  The drawback to this particular product was the DVD portion.  If I would have known its content I would have only purchased the CD.  The DVD only shows the album cover on your TV screen while you listen to the same music that is on the CD.  I thought there would be at least some sort of slide show from the Cirque or something more to the DVD than merely one picture of the album cover and music.  I still love the music though.
0060594888|5.0|By far, the BEST self-development book I have ever read!  Not only does Jack Canfield tell you what changes are necessary for growth & development personally & professionally, he explains in detail how to make the changes. Read this one with a 'highlighter' in hand.  You will want to refer back to this book again & again & again.
B000I5X81K|5.0|I have all of Josh Groban's work. This CD is an amazing gift from him to us. I immediately had a favorite track, however every track on this CD is worth hearing over and over. The stories that are told, the emotions tapped by this young man are true and universal. I love it.
0679446230|5.0|This is a timeless classic; it is a must-read for all.
B000I5YCCO|5.0|This is a great CD.  I got it because I liked her voice and her trademark song \\"Tim McGraw\\" and found that there were other songs on the album that I liked even more like \\"Tear drops on my guitar\\", \\"Stay beautiful\\", and \\"Our song.\\"  It's a good collection, and she's had a hand in writing most of them.
0757302661|5.0|This really works, make sure you have time to relax. If you take the time to practice the methods you will find yourself relaxing through child birth. It is a wonderful experience to bring a child into this world with the Mongan Method.
B000GYI32M|5.0|I love the OC and have been dying to see the series. Great stuff, cant wait for season 4. hurry up and get it
1582701709|5.0|This is an awesome book!!!! What they are saying is soooo true, you have to have an open mind but it does work, give it a try, you will not be dissapointed.  <br />
B000F8O35U|5.0|My daughter requested this DVD as soon as it was available. Now mind you, the daughter in question is 22!<br /><br />If your little person is like mine was, you will hear the strains of \\"Under the Sea\\" almost daily. It was a favorite here and I can't believe that the old tape lasted as long as it did.<br /><br />Enjoy great songs, emotions, and art.
B0001CCX9I|5.0|These performances, dating from the late 60's-early 70's, represent some of the most powerful Beethoven playing on record.  Hungerford plays these works like a man possessed.  Do not look for charm or elegance here, though Hungerford also has a wonderful feel for Beethoven's lyricism (as in the slow movement of op 10/3, played truly \\"largo e mesto\\").  Listen to him explode into the second movement of op 27/1 or the finale of op 26.  Hungerford is, above all, a serious Beethovenian.  He finds little relief in the lighter variations of the opening movement of op 26, for example. This is not to say his playing lacks light and shade, just that the overall impression is one of seriousness and strength.  The recording is  very good, though the pedal is a little noisy at times (though not nearly as distracting as it is in Craig Sheppard's recent set).  If you love Beethoven's piano music, you owe it to yourself to hear these classic performances.
0307237699|5.0|I like his balanced perspective in covering the current political climate.  He's very candid and easy to read.
B000ICLHIE|5.0|Can only agree with the other reviewers.  This is certainly the best music to come out all year.  Tom Waits in all his glory.  \\"Bawlers\\" has been getting the most play in my personal listening rotation but each is equally great.  Get your hands on this if you are a Tom Waits fan or not.  A great introduction to a first time listener for all three discs span the dimensions of Tom Waits genius.  Recommend turning lights down low, cranking the stereo up, and a bottle wine (red) while listening to all three discs and letting Mr. Waits take you on a journey through his world.
1582701709|5.0|Great book, even better than the movie and the movie was great! Easy to read for teens on up. An uplifting book!
B00005JNS0|5.0|Cars is a delightful take-off on the real racing scene.  It's not just for children.  The tractor-tipping episode alone is worth the price of the movie, even though we'd seen it in the theater, already. We liked using the on-screen written dialog feature, which kept us from missing any of the words. If only they could have made the closing credits legible, it would have been perfect.
B000GFLKF8|4.0|This is a thriller that leaves you amazed at the depth of the plot. With a talented all-star cast that delivers, like the suspense novel that the reader can't wait to see what happens in the last chapter, with each twist and turn, the viewer will eagerly await the ending.
B000G7PMD2|2.0|After all these years, DT lacks what they've always lacked; (and is what is at the heart of prog music) and that's a sense of counterpoint and harmonic development.  It's all chord changes with banal melodies and fast licks. Oh sure, the chops are there.  Astounding.  But there's no statement.  The classic bands (Yes, ELP, Gentle GIant, et al) had chops too (though not to the speed of DT) but they had something more ...SONGS.  The intricacies where within the composition.  This stuff sonds like one dimensional jams with fancy riffs thrown in along the way.  It's barely above DraginForce -- who are a joke, but they too have blistering speed.  DT never developed into what I hoped they would. They just do what they've always done, only faster.
032147404X|5.0|No matter how long you have been shooting Digital, you will find something that is new and relevant to help you.  Scott Kelby's writing style is straightforward, freindly and humorous.  It is one of the few photography books that I wanted to re-read immediately.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|Had it on VHS, had to get it on DVD. Teaching my neighbors 7 year old about it and she loves it, sings the songs all the time, had to buy her a copy. A huge regret I have is never seeing CATS on Broadway. For those who don't understand it please get the T.S.Elliot book of cat poems and then you'll understand CATS the musical and felines better.
B00000099Y|3.0|CD arrived damaged which would normally not be a big deal.  But the case has a special viewing feature. <br /> <br />Tried contacting Amazon for a replacement, but was not easy to do.  Basically had to send the one I got back and pay shipping.  Not cool as why should I be penalized for a defective product. <br /> <br />Anyway the music is still great.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|The Wicked CD was the best value at amazon.com, saving almost fifty percent from the theatre price. I will always shop for future Broadway show CDs at amazon.com before buying at the theatre. The CD is the exact same CD at only a fraction of the cost and it's delivered right to your door! Amazing.
B000JLTRKE|4.0|The somewhat loose real situation, modified for Hollywood, is a gripping and emotional rollercoaster ride. The viewer will feel the characters as they are portrayed through each segment of the film. This just reminds us all of the tragedy that bespelled America when this gregious act of terrorism disrupted our way of life.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|This is a great, contemporary compilation of the best of the Beatles. I highly recommend it if you love the Beatles and don't mind a contemporary twist to some of their best music. This is a must-have for any diehard Beatle fan.
0307346609|5.0|I usually don't read this type book or genre but I saw a review in my local news paper and was captivated by storyline and the reviewers wonderful notes. I was not disappointed ! I can't add much to the other exhaustive reviews here on Amazon other then to say this is one of the best books of 2006. Well worth the read!
0767802470|5.0|Riveting, intense, well acted, scripted and directed. There is a very good reason this film is so well known. This version is longer then the original, it was always the director's dream to re-edit this movie and not be crowded by traditional time restraints. I liked the extra scenes it gave more depth to the situation and the characters.<br /><br />From start to finish this movie draws you in and keeps you on the edge of your seat... The depth charges scenes are my personal favorite, so intense...
1582701709|5.0|I recommend you watch the movie for 5 bucks on the internet when you won't be interrupted. Then get the book. No need for notes if you get the book. This was my \\"aha!\\" moment. I understand what I've been learning about for the past six years only I never heard it explined like this. Thank you Rhonda Byrne and thank you to all of the Forces That Be.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|The best product and prompt service - a pleasure to work with.
B000F8O35U|5.0|Little Mermaid is still my favorite Disney Princess.  All of the members of my family love it both male and female ages 3,7,8, and 17.  It is such a classic that I have four copies one for each child to cherish for years to come.
B000I5X81K|5.0|I have listened this is just about every day since I received it.  It is just that awesome.  Josh just keeps getting better and better with each new album.
B000FVE3A2|4.0|Huge!!! This watch is gigantic. Very commanding, lots of compliments. Runs a little fast about 5 min a month. Great value. I would buy more Invictas anytime!
B000GRTQSE|5.0|Bob Dylan has aged marvelously.  His looks are with the times; his music can't be beat.  This is down home stomp blues at its best.  Love that the DVD has songs that aren't on the CD!  \\"Things Have Changed\\" is my favorite of all of the tunes.  So whimsically down-playing his own appeal.  Great stuff!!
B000HCO8IQ|4.0|i love the scissor sisters, they are so different than the artist out their today.  at first i hated the album, but after a couple listens it will be an album i go back too throughout the years.  each time you listen to it, you'll hear a different sound or vocal that you didn't hear before.  its awesome.   <br />1. i don't feel like dancin'--the best feel good sound on the album. <br />2. she's my man--great beat, but one of my least favorites. <br />3. i can't decide--my favorite on the album, has dance beat & great  <br />   lyrics, \\"i can't decide whether you should live or die, oh, you'll <br />   proably go to heaven.  please don't hang your head & cry\\" <br />4. lights--reminds me of something from the 70's disco era.  love it!!  <br />5. land of a thousand words--lovin' the vocal tone for this ballad. <br />6. intermission--elton john plays piano on this one, sounds like a  <br />   show tune to me.   <br />7. kiss you off--great lyrics about telling your man to shove off! <br />8. ooh--reminds me of filthy/gorgeous of the first cd.  great beat that  <br />   will stay in your mind all day long. <br />9. paul mcCartney--another great dance song, this one took the longest <br />   to grow on me.  i still don't understand the title, but that's ok i <br />   like the rhythm. <br />10. the other side--my second favorite.  its a ballad that i never heard  <br />    anyone sing about waiting for their love on the other side, after   <br />    death.  it has a great hook from the begiing to end.  it ends with <br />    a line from the wizard of oz, \\"over the rainbow.\\" one of the greatest <br />    songs on the album. <br />11. might tell you tonight--i used to listen to this one over & over. <br />    another ballad.  kinda pop-ish though. <br />12. everybody wants the same thing--its ok, i like when he sings, \\"gods  <br />    not going to drop you no hundred dollar bill.  you've got to  <br />    question your intentions.  <br /> <br />all in all at first if you hate the album.  give it time it will grow on you & become the album you always go back to in the years to come.  read the lyrics as you listen to it.  they are great. buy it! buy it! buy it!
B000H5U832|5.0|Maybe you have to be a baby boomer to appreciate the detail and sly references made in Cars. I saw things like a Pontiac hood ornament shaped rock formation and Cadilac tailfins in the mountain range. There are so many cool \\"little\\" things in this movie that after seeing it in the theater, I had to buy the DVD. All of the Route 66 and NASCAR elements made this a movie I can watch many times, as I always notice something that I missed during previous viewings. I think that the younger viewers may not \\"get it\\". Paul Newman as a Hudson Hornet is classic and real people voiceing their cartoon characters is an added bonus.
B000I5X81K|3.0|This is a good CD, but not as good as the other two.
B00003CXBH|5.0|I could watch this movie only one time because of what I call the 'disturbing nature' of the film.  It is probably too close to being true. The music, however is well worth owning and listening to over and over and over.  The integration of music with the characters is amazing.  An excellent film, well directed and acted (and played).  Haunting, sad, beautiful.  Deals with the push of the Catholic Church to 'convert' natives to Christianity.  There is a serious question of which were closer to God, the natives with their music or the Church with its pomp, pagentry and blind ruthlessness.
1582701709|5.0|This book is a must read.  I watched the DVD and realised that everyone in the world should be made to watch it and now the book is out with more wonderful insights.  It's so simple what is written here, but unforunately not followed by many. The book is entising, fun & well presented. If you read the book, watch the DVD and follow what they say you will prosper forever in your life. Can't wait for the sequel.
B000HT386M|2.0|THE MOVIE WAS NOT THAT GOOD, I WAS SURPRISE THAT IS WASN'T THAT GOOD. THE MOVIE WAS SLOW, AND NOT THAT FUNNY..SEE BETTER...ONLY 2 STARS..SORRY!!!
0618680004|5.0|I enjoyed it very much.  No matter how intelligent we become we need to invent some supernatural god at great cost to society.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|Finally a BEATLES CD in SUPER sound. I Imagine this is the way they heard their music in the control room with George Martin. The entire CD is a trip back thru memory lane only it sounds and feels like it was recorded yesterday.
0739340131|5.0|Not only is the story great but combine it with a brillient cast to read it and you could almost believe it is real. <br /> <br />I could not stop listening until I reached the end and even then I wanted more.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|What a fabulous way to enjoy yet another chapter in the continuing saga of some of the best music ever recorded. Mixing in parts of other songs and fading in and out of complete songs we're familiar with could only be done by George Martin (and in this case his son's assistance.) I have still not figured out all the snippets, but that's half the fun. Many thanks to The Beatles, The Martin's, Cirque de Soleil and Capitol Records for this new and interesting (and wonderful sounding) mix of The Beatles beautiful work. I feel fortunate to have been born in a time to have been able to grow up with The Beatles music. It has made me feel blessed.
156224003X|4.0|Many people love this book, and I do, too. <br /> <br />Warner's idea of *effortless* mastery and his practical approach are very helpful.  Specifically, I like his recommendation to practice without strain and sometimes without concern for the correct notes in order to remain in a effortless flowing state while playing.  I also like the related speed drills of not worrying about the notes and just letting go (and his point that research demonstrated that the average person on the street has equal finger speed to intensely-practicing classical pianists, thus showing it isn't more physical practice that makes us faster but releasing the mental-locks we put on ourselves).   <br /> <br />The book's overall music-specific idea is that intellectualizing without true mastery burdens our playing, slowing us and making us tense, and this weight makes music laborious and stressful instead of effortless and inspiring.  The book, however, at least equally emphasizes freeing ourselves from fear, which also dampens  our playing (and everything else). <br /> <br />The reason I don't give the book 5 stars is that I don't feel comfortable with a couple of the book's psychological drills. <br /> <br />Specifically, I'm not comfortable with some of Warner's self-esteem-related drills, such as the one where we're supposed to think along the lines of \\"I am god\\" and \\"everything I play is great.\\"  I understand the idea is to free ourselves from fear so we can play effortlessly, but trying to counteract fear and mental demons by going so extreme in the other direction doesn't taste right to me and actually seems wrong psychologically, as if unhealthy narcissism is a dear ally. <br /> <br />Instead of leaning on an unhealthy narcissistic crutch, I prefer trying to grow out of my unhealthy narcissism, and I continue to find non-music books such as \\"Search for the Real Self\\" by Masterson and \\"Why Is It Always About You\\" by Sandy Hotchkiss extremely helpful for this. <br /> <br />Effortless Mastery's main points come across, though: fear of playing poorly or of even making a single mistake, coupled with intellectualizing without true mastery greatly hinders our performance and enjoyment of music.  The book's many practice ideas continue to help me immensely.  I love this book and highly recommend it.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I can't believe they canceled this show!  Hands down, this is the best scifi television program ever.  I hope they make more - great concept, incredible characters, and actually, a plausible (assuming you get passed the scifi aspects) future history.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|I very seldom purchase Christmas CD's; however, this particuliar CD caught my eye.  Sarah McLachlan singing Christmas music? <br /> <br />I played this CD during a road trip with a small group just before Christmas.  Everyone enjoyed listening to Wintersong.  Not one of the songs \\"blasted us out of the car\\". <br /> <br />This CD makes perfect background music for any holiday get together or office environment.  The music is pleasing and allows for undisturbed conversation amoung guest or office workers. <br /> <br />Sarah must have been inspired from the heavens to record a CD such as this.  Not a Sarah McLachlan fan?  It does not matter, add this to your CD collection with confidence.
B000M0W1DC|5.0|Christina has been robbed/snuffed for not getting nominated for Album of the Year.  What a slap in the face and dishoner that this masterpiece was not recognized for this most prestigous award.  This is an absolutely phenominal album.  What is so amazing about it is that she pays homage to the sounds and artists most popular in the 40's, 50's, 60's era's, and at the same time she brilliantly managed to fuse them with a yummy smorgasbord of today's modern day pop/r&b style that is appealing to listeners of all ages.  This achievement is uncommon in today's music scene.  What makes Christina unparalleled to her counterparts is her ability to be different and step out of the box by creating music that is unique, passionate, mature, authentic, intellectual, fun/upbeat, emotional, and overall brilliant.  Every track is authentic music created with actual instruments - not a manufactured sound created in a studio with sophisticated computer and studio equipment.  This album is REAL music.  I also cannot forget to mention her voice, which in itself is unparalleled.  It soars to the Heavens.  She is an amazing talent and artist, and although I am happy that she was at least recognized for 2 nominations - it's a real shame that she was snubbed when you consider that some of her counterparts were nominated for several categories, but their albums are simply manufactured by advanced studio equipment and don't contain an ounce of authenticity.  Really pathetic.  What's up with that Grammy's.  It's an injustice.

B00008IAMD|4.0|Late last year I \\"discovered\\" the American Recordings series Cash did with R. Rubin when I heard his version of Lightfoot's \\"If You Could Read my Mind\\" online.  It moved me to tears!  I rushed out ahd bought V: A Hundred Highways and could not get enough of the disc.  I soon added \\"American Recordings\\" and \\"My Mother's Hymnal\\" along with \\"IV The Man Comes Around.\\"   <br /> <br />Like all the albums in this series, \\"The Man Comes Around\\" is a treasure, but so far it has been my least favorite in the collection.  I think some of the covers were too \\"mainstream pop\\" though executed very well.  \\"Hurt\\" is of course amazing, and I did like the treatment for \\"In My Life\\" and \\"Bridge\\" - \\"Personal Jesus\\" was another strong cover but for the life of me I can't figure out why \\"Danny Boy\\" is on this disc.  For me, it kind of breaks up an otherwise good album. <br /> <br />Still, highly recommended...
B000HBKCDC|4.0|This cd does not stray from her usual sound.  Her voice is beautiful as always.  However, for a Christmas album, it's a little lacking in holiday cheer for my taste.  It's lovely.  It's a great addition to a solid Christmas album rotation, but if I could only have two or three Christmas cds, this would not be one of them.  But I'm not limited to 2 or 3 :)  So I'm quite happy to have and play this.
0143034901|5.0|The Shadow of the Wind is the debut work of Spanish author Carlos Ruiz Zafon.<br /><br />The book is set in Barcelona, during the aftermath of the Spanish civil war.<br /><br />It tells the story of a boy who by chance, discovers a book by a seemingly forgotten author. Curious to know more, our hero begins to look in to the author's past, but as the story unfolds, the lives of Daniel and the author become more closely interwoven until the author's story also becomes his own. But Daniel is not the only one interested in the fate of Julian Carax, and it soon becomes apparent that the interest of his antagonist is not a benevolent one.<br /><br />Carlos Ruiz Zafon has a superior command of language which makes it hard to believe that this is his first work. His prose is both lyrical and atmospheric, drawing the reader in from the opening sentence. While not humorous in a laugh out loud sense, the author has a dry and witty turn of phrase which makes for entertaining reading.<br /><br />The characters are well drawn and strongly portrayed. From the course but loveable Faremeen, to the deeply sad figure of Nuria.<br /><br />Far from being an action packed thriller with nail-biting suspense, The Shadow Of The Wind is a deeply compelling read which is thoroughly absorbing from the first page to the last. Even during light-hearted moments, the reader is never entirely aloud to forget the sinister presence and feeling of danger which, while kept in the background through most of the novel, is nevertheless there, waiting to rear its head.  It is this use of atmosphere that is one of the author's best traits.<br /><br />Listeners to the audio book are in for an extra treat as the book is not only beautifully read by narator Jonathan Davis, but contains piano music composed by the author himself. Played at strategic intervals throughout the recording, the music helps add an extra dimension to a book not easily forgotten.

B000H5U832|5.0|I absolultely love this movie.  It is fun for all ages, 2 to 102.  It also makes you feel good and has a great message of how friends come in all shapes in sizes and no matter where you are in life true friends will always be there for you.  That's what Cars is about.  It's about slowing down every now and then from our fast-paced, rushed world and really look at the important things in life and how beautiful life can be.  It's comical and heart-warming.  My favorite character is Mater, the old, rusted tow truck from Radiator Springs.  He is instantly likeable, with his cheerful demeanor, and comical way of life; a character that sees the good and fun in everything and everyone.  Pixar has always done great with their films and this film is especially great.  Two thumbs up for me. I recommend it to everyone.
0060776757|5.0|I bought this as an early Christmas gift for my best friend. She is the biggest U2 fan ever. She thought is was fantastic and has raved about it. I did not see it as I had it shipped directly to her as a surprise.

B0001KU93C|4.0|Django is one of the greatest of spaghetti westerns and proof that not only Sergio Leone could make them.  The film has a very flimsy plot, but if that's what you're after then a spaghetti western isn't what you should be looking for.  It does however excel in most other ways, the editing, photography, way over the top style and even the performances are decent.  Franco Nero's tough-and-silent-type charisma has rarely been as effective.  This may be the least political of Sergio Corbucci's spaghetti westerns and that is in some ways good and some ways bad (ie making it perhaps more accessible to a mainstream audience, but perhaps making it slightly more shallow at the same time). <br /> <br />Blue underground's dvd is excellent.  The transfer is great and you rarely see a 1.66 AR film with a proper anamorphic release but this has it down perfectly.  It also has the Italian soundtrack, which is a big plus as the dialogue (what little there is of it) is marginally better than the English.  Other extras are fine all round.  Word of warning though, the extra disc is a mini-dvd and contains a brilliant short with Franco Nero. <br /> <br />Highly recommended for (spaghetti) western fans especially, but also for anyone with an interest in the World Cinema explosion of the 60's and cult films.  Beware of the unbelievably many films called Django something-or-other, there's only one...actually, I also recommend the very different and unrelated Django Kill! also available from Blue Underground.
032147404X|5.0|Scott Kelby has put together a great book for digital photographers who want to know how to take the shots you see in the glossy magazines.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I had read the reviews on this website and thought my expectations were too high.  Boy was I wrong, the series blew me away and has become my favorite of all time and I HATE WESTERNS.  This is truly epic, a sci-fi space western that has the most witty dialogue and best character development of any series - in 12 episodes.   <br /> <br />I was fortunate enough to have stumbled on Serenity the movie and knew that I would like the series.  When I become a billionaire one day, I will personally fund Josh Wheldon to continue this epic masterpiece.

032147404X|5.0|Not only did Scott find interesting ways to explain simple and not-so-simple shooting techniques, but he always found a way to make me laugh.  The book is hilarious and informative.  If you are just getting started in photography or want to get a head start on going to the next level this book is a MUST READ!!!  I recommend it to everyone who tells me they want to be a photographer.

B000641Z90|5.0|This is the most spectacular DVD i've seen so far, not to mention that is the most complete, a 2 DVD package with the best of the best artist out there. He managed to make the best concert you could ever see and also you get all the videos from all the songs he played in that concert which are like 20, plus interviews and other amazing stuffs. You buy this DVD and you'll need a lot of time to see it all. Seriusly the best DVD ever with all and i mean it ALL the greatest songs of the great Phill.
B000002A46|5.0|the album contains the essential classic songs for Xmas. Has not aged at all since it was originally released.

1573223026|4.0|I am enjoying the book, just having a hard time keeping interested due to the many switches between characters. I find it hard to keep remembering who is doing what and what their past history is because the story keeps switching between the characters so rapidly.... It could have used a narrator within the story instead of all the different perceptions of the characters. I have to put it down, then go back to it after a while because of my frustration.
B000AMJC2K|5.0|This product is made from quality materials and performs as advertised. It was easy to assemble.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|We stumbled upon this movie and gave out 8 copies last year for Christmas!  Even tho it can become confusing at times, the movie is great!  Bill Nighy is highly underrated as an actor.  In \\"Love Actually\\", he is priceless, adorable and fabulously racey!
B000A59PMO|5.0|I've seen a lot of Teen Crime shows and Veronica Mars is by far the best. The show is well written, witty and engaging. If you are looking for a show with interesting characters and great story lines, then this is for you. I highly reccomend this show to anyone and everyone.
B000HEWEEY|4.0|First, let me mention this is an excellent transfer and I did find the package a welcome addition to my video collection.  To my disappointment, there wasn't a commentary track.  Wouldn't it have been great to hear running comments from Anne Francis and Leslie Nielson alone?  Lacking that, a more comprehensive set of interviews with the actors, most of whom are still alive would have been appreciated.   <br />While I find \\"The Invisible Boy\\" a nice addition, I'd have preferred more data on the making of the film.  The included documentaries skim the surface of the making of the films.  Nice, but more could have been better.  The figure included is a fun item but awfully small and I feel the overall package is missing something that could have made it a truly great five-star package.  <br />
0684857219|5.0|This book has literally changed my life. I started reading and skimming through it about 6 months ago. After I got a very good understanding of just what I needed to do to get in the best shape of my life it was easy from there. Arnold covers EVERYTHING that you need to eat, work out with and do in order to get where you want to be. I would reccomend it to everyone.

0064407667|5.0|For the last time Count Olaf is not the Baudelaire orphans' uncle. He is just a man who is after their fortune. If you remember from the beginning of the book it states that Olaf is their \\"4th cousin 3 times removed or 3rd cousin 4 times removed.\\" This quote therefore implies that Olaf is in no way related to the Baudelaire orphans. I think the book is great. I got the movie as a Christmas present. I thought the movie was okay, but it needed to be expressed that way in order to get movie goers to want to read the books without spoiling the books. I love the way that Snicket wrote the first book because it implies that you could read all of the books out of order and still comprehend the books. The series is made of 13 different books with a few connections, which are the Baudelaire's, Count Olaf, and the fact that the Children will never have a happy ending.<br /><br />I believe that Snicket wrote these books in a \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" format. I n the beginning of Romeo and Juliet the chorus part tells you what happens in the play from beginning to end, and yet to still continue to read it whether you were forced by a teacher or not. Snicket tells us the essentials of the books in the beginning, but how can you enjoy looking a a puzzle with half the pieces missing? You need all of the pieces and need to understand where they go and why they go there. It's like watching the Harry Potter movies; if you haven't read the books you will most likely be  lost somewhat in what is going on. I hope that you have benefited from this review, as much as i benefit reading your reviews which range from the lowest to the highest. I value everyone's opinions even if i do not agree. I like to take others ways of thinking and analyze why they thought that. Please enjoy reading these books, or at least cherish the fact that you got the chance to read them whether or not you enjoyed them.<br /><br />Thank you for your time,<br /><br />Loran
B0009X7664|5.0|Often it is said that \\"the book was much better than the movie.\\"  While I would still not substitute the movie for the book, the movie was ultimately able to capture the essence of the book.  An incredible movie in all the ways that make a movie good.
034537410X|5.0|By merely reading this book and being concious of the concepts, my frequency of having lucid dreams increased. My lucid dreams occurred frequently during adolescence and now they occur occasionally with little implementation of the techniques explained in this book.  I think that anyone who reads this book with an interest in lucid dreaming will see results.
B000I5X81A|5.0|This is the best CD from Eric Clapton since his \\"Unplugged\\" CD. It far surpasses any of his more recent blues eforts. JJ Cale's writing is magnificent and Clapton is the one artist who can truly bring it to the top. Anyone who is a fan of The Blues should seriously listen to this CD.
0684824906|5.0|As I am finishing the last few pages of this book, I am struck by the fact that I don't want to get to the part where Lincoln is assassinated.  I don't want to lose the friend that has been revealed so effectively by Ms. Goodwin.  Sadly I know the outcome but through her magic, I cannot bare the thought.   Before this time to me, Lincoln was always just a President thrust into the Presidency during the Civil War.  However, I have come to know him as the perfect leader and the perfect person for the Presidency.   This book is mandatory reading for anyone that wants to understand how Lincoln balanced complex decisions with deep ethics, morality, intelligence, compromise and feeling.  This book is at least a Pulitzer in waiting.
B00005JKZV|5.0|The movie is one of the three movies that I enjoy watching over and over again.  The Two Towers is wonderfully made and the action is never ending. I own all three movies and would recommend them to any one who enjoys action, adventure and the best of both worlds.
B0001FGBL6|4.0|I must say the only reason I bought this cd was for the song \\"Cry for the moon.\\" But after listening to the cd I fell in love with it. Simone Simons has a beautiful voice, but this cd also has a litle dark side to it with some grwoling lyrics in it.
055358202X|2.0|This book was a chore to read through.  The style of transitioning between characters just as one character's story is getting exciting which was used effectively in the first three books is annoying in this book.  This book develops the story of many of what may be considered \\"lesser\\" characters.  It left me with the feeling that I could have not read it and been fine.  All those pages could have been summed up in a few sentences.
B000GRUS22|5.0|<br />This new work from Enigma is by far my favorite. The sounds and rhythms are so incredible. I listen to this almost once a day just to remind myself what good music really is. I would make this a must have for your collection. <br /> <br />

The best bit is it keeps us all at the table after dinner for at least an extra hour while we play 2 or 3 more games because it's so addictive.  We would describe this game as fun, easy to play, a little competitive (from Dad's side), good for concentration skills, only lasts about 20 minutes so you can't get bored, colorful and fun again!!!  I think this will be the family gift we'll be giving out next Christmas!

032147404X|5.0|This book was my first introduction to Scott Kelby and I am now a fan. Scott simplifies complex subjects with a conversational teaching style. His humor never feels as though it gets in the way. In fact, his humorous writing voice is an effective way of helping the student realize, \\"Hey, relax. It's not as technical as you might think.\\" While reading this book, I truly felt as though I was in safe hands.<br /><br />This is an extremely readable crash course in (digital) photography from which any novice can benefit. I especially enjoyed the \\"If you want to take this kind of photo, then do this\\" section. No technical mumbo-jumbo: If you are looking for your first book on photography, this one would be an excellent choice.<br /><br />UPDATE: 04/16/2007<br />Hey, I decided to try out one of the techniques explained in this book. I wanted the \\"trails of light\\" picture with cars at dusk/night. I took pictures from one side of the Golden Gate Bridge at dusk. Using Scott's techniques, the pictures turned out fantastic. It was easy, much easier than one might expect. Thanks, Scott.
B000CCD0HQ|5.0|Tres Hombres is ZZTops third album. It follows the Texas Blues of the first two albums. A good choice for anyone looking for powerful guitar work combined with a bluesy background.
0060174900|5.0|I purchased two copies, one for my daughter and one as a Gift for her Literature teacher.  We are very happy with the books!
B000J10EQU|5.0|I am a big fan of the original Superman movies and Christopher Reeve.  So I knew it would be hard to imagine anyone else wearing those tights.  I tried not to expect much and in return I was very pleased.  The story line was great and there was enough action for my husband. Special effects have come a long way.  Every now and then Brandon (the new superman) would walk a certain way, say something, or sometimes it was just an expression in his face that would remind me so much of Christopher.  Anyway, I thought they did a great job bringing Superman back to life. I look forward to the sequal.
B00005U122|5.0|A few disclaimers: <br />I'm not a die-hard Floyd Fan <br />I don't worship at the alter of Waters or Gilmour <br />Neither Floyd nor Dark Side... nor The Wall \\"changed my life\\" <br /> <br />Now, with that out of the way, I loved this concert!  Like many of us, I was familiar with Floyd for their 30-year presence on FM Radio.  I recognized and enjoyed their music, but never enough to actually buy one of their albums.  To be honest, I could hear Floyd any time by just turning on the radio or visiting my friends' houses.  Whether this is true or not, it seemed to me that the friends who smoked the most dope seemed to have Floyd on most of the time, so I just figured Floyd was stoner music.  But when I saw these 60-year-old guys get up and close the London leg of the Live 8 broadcast, I was literally blown away.  I taped the MTV rebroadcast and it was even better without any of the host commentary.  Since then, I have bought some greatest hits collections, and even rented The Wall to see what the fuss was all about.  Well, big disappointment, I guess you had to be a disaffected young person to get anything out of it.  But that aside, the music is still great.  I bought this DVD just to see a Waters interpretation of the music, as the Pulse video was all Gilmour.  My conclusion: it doesn't matter who is playing it, this is great music.  Give this one a try if you even remotely like Floyd; you won't be disappointed.
B000AYEL1A|1.0|This was a difficult title for me to find with Streisand and Kristofferson. This item was in-stock and shipped quickly. Quality is as good as any other DVD I have purchased.

B000H305U0|5.0|This CD rocks!! I play it over and over and over and NEVER get tired of it. It is definitely one of Justin's BEST ever!! It makes you want to get up and dance everytime you listen to it. I work out to it and I listen to it in my car...I tell my friends to buy it now!!
B00008GKEG|1.0|I thought there would at least be a decent amount of music on here and from what we watched there isn't.  If I weren't so **** lazy I would have sent it back for a refund.  If you want to know all about their lives etc. and don't care that much about the music it could be a good purchase.  Note to self look up the EXACT meaning of Anthology and other BIG words before making a purchase.  :-)
B000002BBY|5.0|I recently got this CD and I can't believe it somehow almost passed me by.  I consider myself to be reasonably savvy re alternative/progressive/pop rock and I'm constantly searching (all over the world) for good new music.  I'd heard \\"Wonderwall\\" several times on my local radio station of choice (WXRT), but don't recall hearing anything else (except maybe \\"Champagne Supernova\\") from this CD.  I liked the sound, but it wasn't enough to move me to action.  Recently I happened to see this album on a few \\"Best of All Time\\" lists and gave it a try - they were right!  This is a fantastic CD, the best non-compilation I've heard in years!  The song \\"Don't Look Back in Anger\\" is in my personal top 50 of all time and most of the others are also very, very nice indeed - esp. the title cut, \\"She's Electric\\" and \\"Hey Now!\\"  I suppose the controversy about the silly comments made about the Beatles tarnished the aura of this album and cooled some enthusiasm.  That's ironic since, in reality, these songs - altho not Beatlesque - have that certain indescribable something that you don't get much of nowadays and the Beatles had in abundance.  They are still running through my head.  (The songs, not the Beatles.)
B000A0GP4K|5.0|Absolutely Dylan. A must for your DVD collection. The Dylan phenomenon has only started to amass its glactic force despite forty years of overt avoidance. Baby-boomers are remembering, X-gen is starting to appreciate, and Y/Z crowd are discovering Bobby Z and his poet tree. He may yet learn to roll with the punches.
0670038040|4.0|I've read almost everything Rumpole and then re-read it. I've watched everything Rumpole and watched them again. Reign of Terror may not be my favorite, but it's Rumpole non-the-less. I wish John Mortimer a long life  and of course regret the loss of Leo McKern, the Rumpole in all of us.
B0000009S3|5.0|Instrumentally, this is Frank Zappa at his very best, a sometimes frenetic, sometimes lush potpourri of jazz and rock.  On this CD, the musical genius of Zappa and his cohorts is not hidden in a display of antics. Yet there is still a hint of the humor and parody so often used by the Mothers of Invention cohorts. It is consistently fabulous throughout.  It is the way I want to remember Frank Zappa.  \\"Hot Rats\\" is definitely in the top five of all recording CDs I want to keep for all time.  Like all works of true genius, this work is ageless and will be cyclically revived for years.
B000B5MBUG|5.0|<br />Please be warned this is NOT the special edition that is out of print. I have ordered this exact option from Amazon twice and both times it was incorrect. This does NOT feature the cardbox case!!! <br /> <br /> <br />As for the movie. Come on I ordered it twice. That says enough.
B000EHRVP6|1.0|This is advertised as a suspense and horror film. It is neither. The movie is extremely offensive. I have never seen more gratuitous nudity and gore in a single film. There is no suspense in this film. It seems made for people who would like to watch other human being be tortured alive. The biggest problem of all is that you can actually partake in these activities in the 21st century in Thailand. And I am sure in many other countries where mammon rules. <br /> <br />The basic plot of the movie consists of two male students touring Europe for a break before they finish up grade school. They seem to be moving around on their Euro Rail Pass, hunting girls for sexual conquest at ever lay over. Eventually they meet this guy who shows them they will be assured a sure thing in Slovakia. So they head there with girls on their minds. Instead they are the ones who are hunted, caught and then horribly tortured. Where the director makes sure you see every bloody detail. <br /> <br />Two things surprise me about this movie. One is that it was even produced. The second is how any one can give this a decent review. I would recommend that you watch any other movie instead of this one. Do not support torture as a form of entertainment. <br />
B000F0UV0E|3.0|Mark & Emmy, two of my most favorite musical heroes. What happened? The collaboration is nice, some excellent pieces, but overall, a disappointment. I guess they were too intent upon keeping their styles apart rather than melding. Oh well, it's nice to know they tried and respect each other's talent, it should've worked.
B000F3AAUW|4.0|Still like the big single the best of all the tracks, but the rest of the album is very listenable nonetheless.  They are starting to promote some of the catchier tunes now, so I'll probably feel the same way about the rest of the album in time.

0553270435|5.0|I was a very negative, skeptical person before I read this book and started practicing the matter in it.  This book has done wonders for me and my attitude.  I am a much more positive person.  I have read this book twice and even bought it for all my friends and family members that are having a lot of problems in their lives.  It is a wonderful book and I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting to change their negative attitude or who wants to accomplish goals in their life.
B000GY729M|4.0|but definately good enough to have in your collection. it starts really strong but after track 7 or 8 goes downhill
B000002ITW|5.0|One of the all-time great live albums.  It includes an unmatched live version of \\"Southern Man,\\" which features brilliant guitar riffs.
1594200823|4.0|I went into this book with no preconceived notion -- based solely on the tail-end of an interview with the author on NPR (or similar). I like books that describe how things work and books about underlying politics and processes. That is exactly what this book does. It describes the mechanics and politics of food creation and distribution. The beauty is that it uses the author's own experience as a journalist to uncover more to some simple processes than might be first assumed. It is a comfortable non-fiction read. Not scientific or preachy like some books like this can be. It also does not specifically force conclusions about what is right or wrong with the processes it describes. This made the read quite enjoyable all the way to the last meal.

0060899190|5.0|I have purchased both this book and his 2nd book and I found that the first postsecret book was the best. It has a wide range of emotions in its postcards and is filled with much more than the 2nd book. I recommend this book because it is great.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|This is all I expected it to be and more.  Being able to watch this amazing show from beginning to end with no commercials is exactly the way it should be done. <br /> <br />The bonus features are great, but seeing the show and characters evolve without having to wait another week is great.  <br /> <br />I definitely recommend this set for any true fan of the show.  I onnly wish they had kept in on since the last season was one of the best.
B000I5X81K|5.0|I honestly don't see why people are being such purists and want Josh to produce the same thing over and over. He'd get old and boring too quickly if he did that! Awake is an album where he had more input into what went in and you can just tell that he's having fun with his singing. Sometimes I think I hear a smile in his voice. I love this man's voice and would listen to him sing the alphabet song just for the sake of hearing him SING.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|After never getting around to upgrading my Beatles collection from cassette, I finally got most of their albums on CD for Christmas, and my wife threw in the \\"Love\\" CD for good measure. As much as I enjoy hearing all of my old favorites on CD for the first time, \\"Love\\" is the album I keep going back to now that the Christmas season is over.    Some reviewers who don't like this CD are complaining that they could have done better mashups themselves. But this isn't just some hack remix by an anonymous DJ ... it's a loving, carefully crafted re-imagining of some of the Beatles' greatest music, by the man who was largely responsible for shaping the Beatles' sound and helping them evolve fearlessly into previously uncharted waters. No, none of this is intended to somehow improve on the originals; it's simply the originals seen through a new lens. It just so happens that this new perspective breathed a big blast of new life into these beloved tracks.    As time passes, we tend to forget just how revolutionary this music was in its time. And the ready availability of music software that lets anybody with a PC become a remix specialist has spoiled us into thinking that anyone could do a disc like this.     In purely technical terms, that's true -- anybody could mix and match these sounds to their own liking. But it would never have the universal appeal, or the care, or, indeed, the love, that only George Martin, the Man Who Was There, can bring to it.     Just read the liner notes if you don't believe me ... he fussed over this project and worried about tampering with the originals and how they'd be received. He was even hesitant to add any new flourishes of his own, which he ultimately did, with George Harrison's acoustic \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps.\\" In that particular case, Martin brought an added layer of beauty to an already gorgeous, stripped-down version of Harrison's classic tune. And again, a producer who didn't love and help create this music just couldn't havebrought that personal touch to it.     The listing on this CD shows 26 tracks, but you actually get snippets of a lot more Beatles tunes than that. As others have mentioned, the first two tracks incorporate the layered vocals from \\"Because,\\" the nature sounds from \\"Across the Universe,\\" the opening chord from \\"A Hard Day's Night,\\" the drum solo from \\"The End,\\" the final piano chord and ascending orchestral line from \\"A Day in the Life,\\" and then the meat of \\"Get Back,\\" which itself segues seamlessly into the middle of \\"Glass Onion,\\" literally without missing a beat. \\"Glass Onion\\" itself contains a few short seconds of \\"Hello Goodbye\\" and \\"Strawberry Fields\\" and melts into an echo-laden treatment of the \\"ahhh\\" vocalization that opens the lyrics of \\"Eleanor Rigby.\\" It's like getting hit with a whilrwind of tasty shards from all across the Fabs' career. Very nicely done.    For not being a greatest-hits collection, \\"Love\\" still hits a good 75% of the highlights of the Beatles' career. That's not bad. And the reworkings of some of the classics we all know so well are simply amazing. Yes, I'm giving props to the two tracks that seem to be getting all of the accolades, but they're very well deserved -- the drumbeat from \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" laid across \\"Within You Without You,\\" and the mix of \\"I Want You\\" and \\"Helter Skelter\\" taking \\"Mr. Kite\\" to a pounding, dramatic conclusion. (The segue between \\"Tomorrow/Within You\\" and \\"Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds\\" is also a spine-tingling work of genius, by the way.) I'll even give a big thumbs-up to a third track -- small bits of \\"The Word\\" and \\"What You're Doing\\" worked in to the end of \\"Drive My Car\\" so effectively that you'd think that's how the song went if you didn't know the originals. Putting the piano triplet figure and Paul McCartney's funky bass line from \\"Drive My Car\\" behind all of the different parts stitches it all together so that no seams are ever showing.    Even getting to hear parts of the original tracks isolated is a treat, from the acappella \\"Because\\" to the \\"ba-ba-ba-baaa\\" vocal line on \\"Lady Madonna.\\"     One final plug for the music here: The way the Martins handled \\"Hey Jude\\" is a good encapsulation of how they tastefully handled this entire project -- you get enough of the song to make you feel comfortable and satisfied, and you get just enough new twists and turns to make you sit up, take notice, and wonder what surprise is going to be waiting around the next turn. In this case, once we're well into Paul's long coda, the music suddenly cuts out, and all we're left with are the na-nas, the hand claps, and the percussion. From there, we get slowly eased back into the song, first with the bass added in for a few measures, and then finally back into the big fanfare. But that's still not it! At the end, everything fades out but the horns, the music segues into the \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" reprise, and the horns hit their resolving chord at the exact instant the \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" guitars kick in. So simple, yet so amazingly well done.     George and Giles Martin get a standing ovation for me for breathing new life into these songs. Even though these tracks are all in the neighborhood of 40 years old, they sound as fresh and vibrant as if they'd been recorded yesterday. They had an enormously daunting task placed in front of them -- they knew they had to treat these iconic songs that people love so much with care, yet they had to make them \\"new\\" enough to carry the performance for which they were prepared. I think they did a masterful job. And kudos also to Cirque du Soleil for giving rise to this project in the first place. My wife and I both love the Cirque, and I imagine we'll be boarding a plane to Vegas sometime this year to see whether the show itself can possibly live up to its music. If it can, it's going to be amazing.

B00006CXSS|5.0|I purchased this set for my father, a WWII veteran.  He feels that it is very well done.  The range of actors involved is superb and really brings the experience to life. It's so realistic that my father has to fast forward through a few scenes because he re-lives his own memories.  He and I would recommend Band of Brothers to anyone interested, not only in WW II, but in a good action/drama movie.
B000ETRCMQ|2.0|This is rather a juvenile story, very predictable. Being a tranny my self, I was rather looking forward to a better grade of story. I have given the DVD to friends as I probably wouldnt watch it again. Dissapointing too that the role was played by a woman.
B000HBKCDC|3.0|... But kinda repetitive if you play it straight through.  Really don't like the version of \\"War Is Over\\" -- just doesn't do anything new with the song at all.
B000ICLHIE|1.0|Tom Waits is such an engaging artist and writer, but this latest attempt at entertainment is so very disappointing. Too much shouting vs. singing on this group of songs. There are a couple of pieces on the Bawlers disc which are pleasant, but for the most part this is a mound of what comes out of the back end of the horse. I would prefer a reading of the poetry instead of this substitute for song. Come on Tom, let your voice make music, not road gravel.
B0002234LS|5.0|You know I woke up thinking about Johnny Depp this morning (June 9, 2015- yeah I'm editing/updating my review several years later- I do that sometimes!)  I wonder if I was having a dream last night about his character in Pirates of the Caribbean, because I woke up today thinking about the first time I experienced a DVD player and how I was watching Pirates of the Caribbean with my dad and his girlfriend back in 2006.  We were all totally blown away by the sound system.  It was hilarious watching my dad try to fall asleep halfway through only to keep waking up whenever a loud sword-slicing moment occurred.  Anyway yeah, Secret Window!  In my original review (which I've deleted because it's awful) I didn't really explain what makes Secret Window so good.  Perhaps because I didn't quite get it then.  Actually finishing it up 45 minutes ago, I don't get it now either, haha!  Well the movie makes perfect sense 90% of the way through.  A strange man with a southern Mississippi accent wearing a black hat shows up to Johnny's doorstep and accuses poor Johnny (who plays a writer struggling to come up with ideas for a story- nothing original there) of stealing this mans story,  but Johnny can defend himself by claiming his story came out first and can prove it by way of a magazine article that lists the date (2 or 3 years prior to this mans story).  But it just so happens it takes a *very* long time for Johnny to actually get ahold of this magazines even though he should have nailed this in the bud a long time ago.  Meanwhile this crazy mysterious man goes around killing people and causing nightmares for Johnny until the magazine arrives.  Well there's no easy way to say this without spoiling it, so I'm going to go ahead and reveal a REALLY BIG SPOILER!  Stop reading now if you haven't seen this movie!  Seriously, stop reading NOW!  The last 10% of the movie is just crazy because it drastically jumps away from the elements of the story we were watching up to this point.  It turns out right when the magazine arrives the article in question is missing, and Johnny wonders how it was possible for the mysterious man to remove it.  I'm going to assume Johnny deliberately ripped out the article and mailed it to himself because it turns out he's secretly psychotic.  All along this mysterious man with the black hat isn't real- he's a character Johnny made up in one of his stories, and Johnny is simply going around portraying him.  Ah ha!  So when Johnny's ex-wife and her husband show up so Johnny can finally sign those divorce papers (seriously this should've been nipped in the bud a long time ago too!)  he goes crazy and kills both of them!  It's a shocking change of direction after the build-up leads us to believe there really IS a mysterious killer on the loose burning down homes, killing cops and leaving very little clues behind.  Poor Johnny has mental issues!  You know I actually don't care for Johnny Depp that much as an actor.  He usually plays in movies that make very little sense or feel greatly exaggerated to the point of being unwatchable, but Johnny pulls off a wonderful performance here by keeping the story subtle and easy to follow.  Basically he locks himself away from society in a log cabin and only comes into contact with a couple cops (the older one hilariously out of touch with reality the way he didn't take Johnny's concerns that there's a murderer after Johnny seriously- at this point in the story the cop most certainly SHOULD have taken it seriously.  Obviously a dog hater too!) or when he needs to head into town.    So yeah, great movie.  Expect a lot of quiet atmosphere as Johnny walks around his house doing nothing thinking up story ideas, but there is a story building here slowly believe it or not.  The characters are given an appropriate amount of time to develop.  And the character that goes by the name Ted (Johnny's ex-wife's husband) he's just a knucklehead who does the dumbest of things. I feel bad for any woman who marries such a silly wall-punching man, haha.  Johnny has some fun with him too, don't worry.  Overall well what a movie!  We're led to believe there's a murderer out there all along but BOY do we get the surprise of our lives!  Perhaps nowadays with so many plot twists out there the outcome of Secret Window doesn't stand up as being nearly as surprising as it once did, but it's still a really wonderful and well-told story.
B00005J6T0|5.0|\\"True Blue\\" was the beginning of a remarkable part of Madonna's career in which she came into her own as a songwriter and sang with fearlessness.  I only knew about half of the songs on this CD when I purchased it, and I've enjoyed listening to the whole thing.  There are a few weak songs (like \\"Where's the Party\\"), but the album holds together as a whole.  This album, along with \\"Like a Prayer\\" and \\"Erotica\\", was a distinct high-mark for Madonna.

B000IJ79WU|5.0|Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut is an historic release. Never before in Hollywood history has the fired director of a major motion picture been invited to re-edit his film the way he wanted it released. Allow me to explain. <br /> <br />Richard Donner (director of the original The Omen, producer of The Goonies) hit the jackpot with his 1979 smash, Superman: the Movie, also known as Superman I. Boasting big name superstars like Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor and Marlon Brando as Jor-El, this first Superman film became one of the most popular movies of all time, launching the career of a young unknown named Christopher Reeve. Under Donner's direction, the Superman legend was given a modern treatment that carefully balanced reverence for the character while giving the audience a rollicking fun time.  <br /> <br />Naturally, a sequel was planned and, in fact, Donner shrewdly filmed Part I and Part II simultaneously, to save money on sets, special effects, and actors' contracts. It almost worked, but cost overruns forced the director to abandon the filming of Part II so he could concentrate on getting Part I released on time for Christmas 1978. Even so, Donner managed to get 75% of Part II in the can. <br /> <br />Fast forward a few years later. Donner was eager and ready to complete Superman II, but the producers, Alexander and Ilya Salkind, wanted to take the franchise into a different direction. They also did not want to pay Brando the same $3 million salary he enjoyed for Superman I. Donner and the Salkinds feuded openly about their creative differences. Seeing no resolution, the Salkinds fired Donner and hired Richard Lester, a comedy director known for his successful films with the Beatles and the Three Musketeers franchise.  <br /> <br />Superman II, directed by Richard Lester, was another blockbuster hit when released in the summer of 1980. The film was critically acclaimed, but fans missed Richard Donner's reverent-but-fun tone. Lester brought more comedy into the franchise, for better and for worse. Superman II also had a few continuity glitches and some far-fetched resolutions (Superman erased Lois' memory of their adventure together with a kiss??). Most lamented was the absence of Marlon Brando's Jor-El. Over the years, as the story of Superman II's behind-the-scenes fueding was revealed, fans of the Man of Steel could only imagine how the movie might have turned out if Richard Donner had been allowed to direct it.  <br /> <br />Apparently, Superman fans are a more vociferous group than one might imagine. Warner Brothers received mountains of requests for a Richard Donner cut of Superman II. After all, Donner actually filmed 75% of Part II. Lester cut out half of that and filmed new scenes so he could receive full credit as director. Finally, the studio relented, tying the release of the Donner cut to coincide with Superman Returns.  <br /> <br />The Donner Cut DVD tells the whole story of how Donner and his team painstakingly searched through several tons of original negatives to restore the film. Donner had to use a small percentage of Lester's takes because, alas, Christopher Reeve is now deceased and all the surviving actors have aged considerably in the past 25 years. To make up for unfilmed scenes, Donner utilized at least one of the original screen tests that Reeve and Margot Kidder filmed when they were trying out for their parts in 1976. <br /> <br />Given all this, one would think that the resulting film would be choppy and uneven. On the contrary, Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut is an emotional triumph! It is an absolute thrill to see a young Christopher Reeve in new footage as Clark Kent/Superman, particularly in his poignant interaction with Marlon Brando as his Kryptonian father. There are delightful additional scenes of Lois' schemes to unmask Clark as Superman, and the clownish tone that Lester applied to the three Phantom Zone villains has been deleted so that they come across as truly menacing.  <br /> <br />Donner's version of the story actually plays out better than Lester's. I don't want to give away any spoilers, but let's just say that the infamous \\"memory kiss\\" is gone. The romance between Lois and Clark seems more genuine because of this decision. Okay, I know some folks might not like the way Donner resolved the story, but at least it's consistent with what he established in Superman I. <br /> <br />Bottom line: Get Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut. If you're a Superman fan your spirit will soar watching this movie the way it was originally conceived and intended. If you're a film buff, you'll get a kick out of the sheer novelty of giving a fired director a second chance to complete his movie 25 years later. <br /> <br />Now, if only George Lucas can go back and re-do The Phantom Menace . . .
B00004RF8J|4.0|This is a terrific movie and a good interpretation of the Broadway show.  Ellen Greene reprises her stage role and is just terrific.  Rick Moranis is suitably nerdy as Seymour.  A really fun movie at a great price.
0307237699|4.0|Insightful.  Gives you a real sense of the man and his views on issues important to the middle class and Americans in general.  I would deginitely recommend it.
1905236042|3.0|The cards have great illustrations.  I am disappointed in the names on each card.  Many poses are called different names.  I had planned to use these cards in a yoga class I teach for kids.  However, the poses have new names that I have had to learn and teach the kids so that I use the cards.  I would much rather teach the more well know name for each pose instead of a name that was created for one product.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I guess you could say that I am just a tad biased... <br />I have always known that i had a Pink Floyd \\"jones\\". From my early memories as a 16 year old listing to the very first PF album in my friend's basement-with a set of drums, a fender strat, and assorted other poor experimentations. On to Pink Floyd at Winterland SF, then at Fillmore West ( I think?) I even saw them in Australia in 1970-a disaster, as they were made to play at a horserace track.-Then on to 85' 94' Gilmore, Wright, Mason, the version on the DVD.(Just got hitched-5th row seats were our wedding gift to each other)& so on.... <br />October 2006- I order Pulse. I listen to Pulse. It becomes a weekend ritual- I can stay up late on Fri. & Saturday nights; I listen & watch Pulse, headphones on, like a gourmet picking thru treats that are particularly fresh that night. It has become an obsession.I am going to wear out my copy. Already thinking of buying another copy. The thought of a skip or scratch is constantly on my mind. The lunatic is in my head..... <br />I have never experienced anything like it- Nothing is more interesting or profound to me- I hide it from my wife, Like a drug.. Although, no drugs are needed. This is the most musical fun I have had in years. As Richard Wright said about making Dark side fo the Moon: It is,was, magical, but i can't explain why. I am also absolutely positive that it will not have the same effect on everyone. I guess you had to be there.....
0307237699|5.0|This book should be read by everyone regardless of political view. This man takes you on a roller coaster ride through his political views; you can't agree with all of them, but you do come away with an agreement that this democrat has a very centered (both personally and politically) view of the country and its problems/opportunities. An excellent read.
B000I5X81A|4.0|Eric is still putting out great music!  Glad to see this collection with long time buddy JJ Cale.
B000784WMW|4.0|OK, so maybe he is too good looking too actually merit Charlotte Bronte's approval, but he is wonderful in this film. You might think of him as James Bond for all time, but this I believe is his best work! He's got Rochester's tall dark figure, he's got the brooding and teasing down pat, he does the melancholy changeable spirit of Rochester to a fault...he does it all.  <br /> <br />Zelah Clarke as Jane does a fine job as well. She's partly how I pictured Jane in my head when I first read the book all those years ago. She well acts Jane's spitfire spirit that arouses when Rochester baits her into confessing her love for him. That midnight garden scene is delicious... <br /> <br />The movie has an old feel to it and the filming seems a bit unprofessional at first glance, but keep on watching. They actually do the gypsy fortune teller scene, which most movie versions skip, and I think that scene is necessary for the story. The acting is brilliant, and \\"Jane\\" and \\"Rochester\\" will win you over and keep you breathlessly watching until the end.
0060594888|5.0|Jack Canfield is remarkable. I love reading and applying his principals. This book provides simple principals and exercises to help anyone overcome limiting beliefs and obstacles that get in the way of your life goals and dreams. I gave a copy of this book to both of my sons who are in their 20's.
0060776757|5.0|We all like U2 but especially my wife.  She really wanted this book and she is very happy.
0618680004|5.0|If you never read another book on this subject, read this one!  I'd never read anything by Richard Dawkins before, but that has now changed.  His writing just flows as he makes his point with facts interjected with humor.  The God Delusion is a keeper.  He might even make you change your mind!
B000I5X81K|5.0|Alright, I'll admit it: most of Josh Groban's lyrics are cheesy. <br /> <br />But the question is, who cares? His amazing voice is more than enough to make up for it. Additionally, if you don't speak Italian or Spanish, chances are you won't be reminded of the sappy factor for a number of the songs. The fact is, even if his lyrics could be better, his voice is the real reason he has so many fans--and it certainly doesn't disappoint here. \\"Don't Give Up (You Are Loved),\\" which some fans complained was the sappiest song he had ever done, turned out to be excellent simply because you can't find a better male vocalist than Josh Groban. <br /> <br />One of the things I was very glad about was his collaboration with Imogen Heap on the song \\"Now Or Never.\\" As you can tell, the lyrics and the instruments are considerably different than the other tracks. The other guest artists, including Lady Black Mambazo on \\"Weeping\\" and \\"Lullaby,\\" were great to listen to and made the album really enjoyable. <br /> <br />If you're a Josh Groban fan, or want to check him out, I would definitely recommend this album.
0060849827|3.0|I think this book is very general in it's explanation of survival in specific areas of the world. I would recommend this book for those who are looking for suggestions on how to survive for a short time in the wilderness. There are other books out there that are more specific to certain climates and I would imagine that Lofty could even write those books knowing that he served with the SAS and probably put in a lot of field time.
B000056JYB|5.0|This is a real blast from the past.  I am really glad I added this to my collection.  It was very nice to listen to.  I did think some of the jams on the second (special) CD were a little long and repetitive but it was good on a long trip.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Follow the tale of two men (Sam and Dean Winchester) out on the search for their missing father. The story starts in 1983 when \\"The Demon\\" that took their mother. Fast forward into today where Sam is in college and Dean is in the family business of demon hunting. The boys father disappears and so begins the quest of finding him.  <br /> <br />Many of the stories are based off of legends and folklore such as the hookman, wendigo, and reapers. Being into ghost stories, myths and legends, this show was really up my alley. There's comedy, action, and drama. The stories are well played out and Jensen Ackles and Jared Palidecki are great actors.  <br /> <br />I would recommend this series to anyone that loves a good ghost story, or just a great story in general.
B000002B35|5.0|This purchase just corroborated my previous good experience with amazon.com <br />The DVD has no damage at all, arrived to my address quickly and was in a fairly good price.
B00004STPT|5.0|I bought this disc not just for listening, i have used some episodes from the soundtrack for my presentation in Microsoft Powerpoint, with my own poetry for one of my best friends. And I want to say - it looks great - music from Gladiator, pictures from Rome period and some poetry. Its something what I wanted. You can listen also almost all disc when you driving ! I do :)
B000B8QEZG|3.0|If you're looking for \\"The Immaculate Collection,\\" you'll be disappointed.  There are a few strong songs in this collection, but nothing like the best of Madonna.  I watched Madonna's special on televsion during 2006 and got excited about buying \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" (which featured many of the songs she performed on televison), but the video portion of the television broadcast must have significantly enhanced the audio experience because I was under-whlemed when I played the CD.
B000H5U832|5.0|I haven't seen this DVD yet because I gave it to my Granddaughter for Christmas but I couldn't have been more delighted at the service I got from Amazon when ordering it. This came within days of when I ordered & I have never had service like that before. Thank you....
B000IMUYJM|5.0|Ordered three copies of the movie for Christmas presents.  They were delivered in two days!  Great service and movies were in excellent shape.  Thank you and will most definitely use that company again.
B00009P1MP|5.0|My 9 year-old loves this.  Really wanted her to have the full length version.  Other good songs as well.  Glad we got it!
0803730470|5.0|Our speech therapist first read this book to my son, and all I heard about for a week was \\"read the Gruffalo Mommy\\".  We had to read this book every night for weeks after we got it.  We've had it for 2 months now, and he still requests it several nights a week.  Great book!  My daughter likes the book too, but her twin brother won't give it up long enough to let her look at it...
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I particularly like the genre. I love the interaction between Sam and Dean. They get on each other's nerves just like regular brothers do. They also work out their problems and get the job done. I am looking forward to Season 2.
B00005JO9J|4.0|Arrived in good condition and shipped with in a couple days after purchase.
B000FIMG68|5.0|First of all, love the show!  CD's arrived as promised, one time, great condition!
B000HIVQK8|3.0|I bought this second Living in the Material World CD because it included a DVD.  I was hoping it had more footage from the Concert in Japan or simply more music performed by George Harrison in a visual format.  I was very disappointed indeed.  I wish the Harrison family would put out the entire Concert in Japan for us diehard Harrison fans.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|How do you deal with knowing something that is so important and profound that no one wants to hear of it because it is inconvenient for them to hear or believe or act on what they heard?  Heroically, that's how.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I was so impressed by this film that I gave it to all my children this year for Christmas. Mr. Gore did a wonderful presentation of the facts. This was a film that we all should see and have discussions about and hopefully adapt our lives to help stop Global Warming.
0743289412|3.0|I'd never read a Stephen King novel before although I've seen plenty of movie adaptations of his stories! Thought it about time I gave his actual writing a try. I found \\"Liseys Story\\" slow paced and melancholic without much depth. It started with promise but I found after the first few chapters that I didn't grow to know Lisey at all, which was strange given it was meant to be her story, not her deceased husband's story. There were moments of tension, but largely the story was highly reflective without much pay-back...
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|I bought this DVD for my granddaughter who is 4. She absolutely loves it and has watched it multiple times since receiving it for Christmas. She loves to dance and sing along with the songs. It is a fairly long film and we don't always make it all the way through it.
B000AP04KQ|5.0|Classic movie... very funny to anyone that's ever worked in an office. Especially if you've ever jammed a printer or fax machine!!  The more you watch this movie the funnier it is.  It is one of those you find yourself quoting and talking about later without realizing it.
B000FIMG68|5.0|LOST season 2 is phenomenal! Answers many questions and satiates your desire for all the great charactars! Make sure to watch season 1 first, though!
B000J3EEBY|5.0|Like other fans of Loreena McKennitt, I had anxiously waited for her new release in almost nine years.  I wasn't disappointed.  A great voice and a great selection of songs.
0618680004|5.0|To turn everything upside down, and we can't be doing that often enough!, for the \\"believers\\" this book doesn't bring much news. Dawkins has written so many brilliant books and has said the same so often so eloquently, that they will not be surprised. A great read, finely tuned prose and excellent examples to illustrate the major points. For the \\"non-believers\\" it's different matter altogether. Once again, they're probably very upset, this time more then ever because of the very much \\"up-yours\\" tone of Dawkins's prose. It serves them well!
1565231023|4.0|If you are interested in carving NA faces or cowboys, you will love this book. The instruction will also be useful in general for any type of face, though the artist seems particularly concerned with aged, lined, character-rich faces.
B0000X61UU|5.0|I'm a big fan of the first shape your body so I came in with higher expectations. I ordered both but I still prefer the first that I used 10 yrs ago!. Its got interesting nature and industrial like settings, great music by seal and moves quickly. The good points of The Next Challenge video is the ability to focus on different segments like upper body one day and so forth so you can do just 20 mins instead of the full 40 plus minutes on the shape your body. Music not as good but still better than your typical Denise Austin. And Cindy has a very relaxed and upbeat personality. overall give it an A!
B000GFLE86|5.0|Loved her music and love the convenience of shopping on line.  Thanks.
0192838679|5.0|Les Liaison Dangereuses is very simply one of the best stories I have ever read. Its central characters, Vicomte de Valmont and the Marquise de Merteil are despicable human beings, but with a charm, wit and intelligence that endear them to the reader. I could not help but share their joy in deceiving and manipulating their victims, whilst at the same time being appalled by their behaviour.<br /><br />I first heard of this book whilst reading Robert Greene's, The Art of Seduction. His reasons for choosing this wonderful book as a source of inspiration are obvious! This book is highly instructive for the student of human behaviour, and a pure pleasure to read for those who enjoy a well constructed and interesting story. Is the book truly \\"dangerous\\"? Be your own judge.
B000ESSTKQ|4.0|The Package. <br />Double digipack containing a remastered Audio CD, and a DVD with remastered stereo, 5.1, and DTS versions of the album. The DVD also contains the extra tracks and a half-hour \\"documentary\\". <br /> <br />The Good. <br />The documentary is a great bonus. <br />The remastered CD is better than the original CD release, albeit only marginally. <br />It is very interesting to hear the DTS versions because you can pick up a lot you never heard in the original stereo versions. Tracks are nice and crystal clear, and also slightly different from the originals, and not just because of the DTS. The vocals are very clear and for once it is easy to understand the lyrics. <br /> <br />The Bad. <br />Why does the CD not contain the extra tracks? This is completely bizarre! <br />The DTS versions are not very well done. The drums sound puny compared to the originals and are very watered-down on several tracks. New Life is particularly weak. It's difficult to describe but you will hear it instantly - the \\"clap\\" sound present in most of the original snares is very distant or non-existant, so it's quite strange to hear this. Some FX seem to have been stripped from or modified in certain sounds and, while interesting, detracts from the enjoyment - I find myself thinking \\"it's not supposed to sound like that\\". This is especially true in sounds where reverb seems to have been lowered considerably. <br /> <br />If I had the choice over again, I'm not sure I would have paid the $23 for this package. The Audio CD could have been remastered a lot better and should have included all the b-sides and extra tracks - try getting them from the DVD onto your iPod!!  Also, how about some other studio tracks from around the same time as extras - Television Set, Reason Man, I Like It ... etc. This alone would make it worthy of being called a \\"Deluxe\\" edition.

B000AYELVU|5.0|An exciting and suspenseful follow up to the first X-Men film.  My favorite part is still the climatic clash between Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike.  For style buffs, note the changes in style and character of Jean Grey and Storm.  It's too bad that Alan Cummings couldn't return as Nightcrawler for X3.
B0000CAQ27|5.0|Absolutely beautiful! Enjoyed it so much, it gives me a like an injection of energy. My absoulte favourites are track #1 trouble and #8 Save my life!
B00004YX39|5.0|This album is the BEST album of Steely Dan.<br /><br />SACD virsion exists(SACD = Super Audio Compact Disc, by Sony and Phillips).<br /><br />If you have an SACD player, you should buy the SACD virsion.<br /><br />There are some sound distortions(or noises?) in this album,<br /><br />although the sound quality is very good.<br /><br />It's very sorry.<br /><br />I like especially guitar solo play in \\"the third world man\\".

B00000K3CM|4.0|We enjoyed both [[ASIN:B000HT3PQK Home Alone]] and Home Alone 2 - Lost In New York.<br />However, the sequel is very much more violent than the first Home Alone. Our granchildren, ages 5 and 7, kept asking why Marv and Harry weren't dead! Because of all the repreated brick throwing head and face hits, the kerosene rope fire where they fall to the ground from several stories, gasoline in the toilet head dousing and subsequent explosion, the over the top machine gunning of a woman in the TV movie sequence and various other happenings of the same nature, it was no wonder they asked that question! A question asked more than once or twice and, they were serious I might add!<br />Now, I have watched many blood and guts war movies without any qualms and, as a retired Marine with 28 years of service, have seen my share of violence but I was uncomfortable with the repeated level of violence in a movie geared to family viewing!<br />Don't get me wrong, Home Alone 2 was funny and as an adult I understood, but watching through the eyes of my grandchildren I also understood why they asked that question. So, because it had more over the top sadistic undertones than I thought necessary, I deducted one star. ~ The Boss (Mrs. B. agrees!)
B000000W5B|4.0|I had read some negative things about this album.  I am a diehard Stones fan and wanted to include it in my collection and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this album.  It is pretty fantastic!  I would recommend it highly

B00005QZWI|5.0|One of Howard Shore's best soundtracks around.  The music is strong enough to tell its own separate story apart from FOTR.  You will never tire of the heart-pounding excitement from The Bridge of Kazaad-Dum track.
1400082773|5.0|Although Barack Obama has recently written and spoken somewhat self-effacingly about his first book, Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance, I find no fault with this well-written account of internal reconciliation.  The book has been described as unsentimental, which is true; yet, the story of Obama's life before he was in the public spotlight is powerfully moving, and affords one plenty of insight into the people and events that helped form the supremely rational, compassionate Obama many of us are just now getting to know.  I highly recommend this book.
B0009X75RO|5.0|I love Chicago! <br /> <br />This movie is so great after a break up! hah. I just love the characters, the actors/actresses that play them and the story line...

B00005221M|5.0|Love this movie!!! Director took liberties with the story but WHO CARES? Did YOU ever read the book?? Both Daniel Lewis and Madeline Stowe look and act brilliantly. Music is stunning, cinematography breathtaking. Direction is crisp and visceral. I just love this movie!!!
0743289412|3.0|This is the first Stephen King novel I have ever read.  I don't know if that makes voids my opinion or saves me from being biased.  For some reason, I never got around to picking up one of his books. I'm not even sure how I wound up with this one, but I did hear it was supposed to be the greatest thing he has ever written, or something like that.<br /><br />I'll just get my negative feelings out of the way.  Is this really the best he can do?  I'm not saying this wasn't great, but when one has super-high expectations, what can one do?  This was supposed to be a story of unconditional love between a husband and a wife.  Instead, I find myself reading a book about a woman who seems to have no life or identity outside her dead husband.  This was addressed in the first paragraph, sure enough, but the development of Little Lisey's never really anywhere.  I am left with a semi-complete idea of her character.  I found myself much more interested in the life of her sisters than in the life of the protagonist!  Also, the idea that Lisey's husband Scott was a great writer hits a little too close to Mr. King.  Then comes a praising of Scott.  Scott was wonderful, despite his tortured soul!  Oh, Scott!  Scott, you should be exalted!  Oh, good grief!  I don't confess to know Mr. King personally, but I really hope this wasn't an outlet for an ego trip.  Also, I felt a lot of the story was rather superflous.  Most of my interest mounted in the last few chapters.  Some ideas were just too much.  Mr. King attempts to reach for some spiritual level of marriage, but fails, due to the fact that the marriage comes off as a relationship entirely focused on Scott, with Lisey only there for Scott's benefit.  I don't think that's a healthy relationship.  Then there was the plot. I think the plot came from a psycho coming after Lisey.<br /><br />Now some good things.  I did enjoy the story and I will not deny that.  Mr. King is gifted with words. The syntax and the secret words of the marriage are amazing to behold.  The idea of Boo'yah Moon was especially meaningful, an imaginative creation of a universal ideal.  I liked it as a real place, rather than some psuedo-intellectual \\"state of mind\\".  That really drove it home for me.  Mr. King also shows a bond of sisterhood reminiscent of Ya-Ya Sisterhood and the like.  It's odd coming from a man, but I accepted it.  This \\"good\\" section looks  a little small, but I will say that what was mentioned here truly did score very high with me.<br /><br />I was stuck between 2 or 3 stars. I'm going for 3 to be nice.  I still have my reservations, but Mr. King did get me to read this book all the way through in a rather timely manner.arriage are amazing to behold.

156224003X|5.0|Musicians: this book will improve your playing.  Everyone I know who has read it agrees, but the funny thing is it strikes each individual from a different angle.  I was able to relax and let go of alot of excess tension at the piano.  A fellow friend and saxophonist reported improved concentration.  The excessively literal-minded will find the analogies and ambiguous instructions to be difficult, but just let go of the need to make sense for a little while and you'll improve ;)
B000HEVZ9O|5.0|This Mission is the best yet. If it were in a different genre and had less tabloid rubbish surrounding it, it would be nominated for an Oscar. JJ Abrams is a great director. Love the first scene & someone should cast the 'I'd marry him' girl in a leading role immediately!
B000JBXY1W|5.0|OK, I'll start by admitting my bias when it comes to this film.  Field of Dreams is my favorite all-time movie--there, I've said it!  So this release was obviously among my first HD DVD purchases, and I have to say I wasn't disappointed in the least.  It looks and sounds better than ever.  A lot of reviewers have taken this HD DVD to task for the apparent grain and false hues in the image, but my conclusion is that this transfer is the very best that can be had from the original film stock.  The release shouldn't really be criticized for decisions the director and DP made 15 years ago!  So, yes, I agree that this isn't the best image I've seen on HD DVD, but it ain't bad, either.  By no means does it distract from the engrossing, emotional storyline.  The extras, ported over from the 15th anniversary DVD release, are abundant and interesting, especially for the legions of fans still captivated by this film.  They just don't make 'em like this anymore,  so don't dare miss this movie (and HD DVD), which makes you who believe that anything is possible if you have faith.

0425179877|5.0|I enjoyed reading this eye opening book.  I've read others about the space program and it's interesting to see the different perspectives of the men involved.
074356619X|5.0|This has to be the best audio book I have ever purchased. I highly recommend this to anyone and everyone! it is all how you think about it. You want it, you ask for it, believe you have it and it can be yours. Faith is the key word here. Even if you don't own this, find it and just listen - you'll want to buy it after that. Have it with you in your car and listen to it on the way to and from work. Listen while you are doing the dishes or maybe some house work. You don't want to miss out on this!
B000ICL3KG|5.0|There is some clout to having the credentials of Vice President associated to you.... You can commandeer a US Naval Submarine to pop through the polar ice to prove your point. But its also true that having your name associated with one of the most contested presidential elections in 20th century history does hurt audience draw. <br /> <br />But people, get over your feelings for this man and listen to the message! He has assembled the best and brightest thinkers and creatives to make the most compelling argument for recognizing Global Warming as a real and impending threat to existence. If you can't stand Gore, you need only cover your ears for less than 4 minutes of this 96 min film... the rest is very compelling data and statistics presented in several easy-to-understand examples that hopefully convince you that despite the ridiculous claims made by corporate sponsored mouthpieces and a white house in complete denial, this record hot January is not El Nino, but our abuse of the planet. See it with Family and Friends.
1594200823|5.0|I originally checked this book out of my local library, thinking I'd scan it and read excerpts that interested me.  I found it so engaging, however, that I just went back to page one and read it all the way through.  It's a fascinating chronical of four different food systems.  I never understood our industrial food system before and came away with a new understanding of what I'm actually eating when I buy processed food.  It's sobering to realize how unnatural and unsustainable our current factory/industrial food system is.  The bright light that shines through this book is that it doesn't have to be this way at all.  This book is a pleasure to read, along with being powerfully informative.  Highly recommended!
1400032717|3.0|alright.. kind of like reading sci fi in that the idea behind the book is interesting, but the book itself kind of falls flat.  a very quick read.
B0000AQS6R|5.0|This has got to be the finniest, over-the-top Christmas movie ever made. Its hard to believe it was made in 1989. It has a look and feel like it was made 2 or 3 years ago. The Christmas season wouldn't be complete without Clark Griswold and family.
B00005JO9J|5.0|This is one of the most wonderful shows I've watched in a long time.  It is great to have all the episodes in a row so that you don't have to wait a week to see the next.  I went right out and bought season 2 because I just had to see it and I can't wait for season 3.  I highly recomend this to anyone who likes medical shows or just watching good looking men.

B000JRYOPG|5.0|This movie is very raw, full of excitement and gritty. When it comes to gansta flicks, this will also be noted since it shows a diff spin. It is truly the jamaican version of Belly.
032147404X|4.0|Though it may be somewhat redundant, this title is great for beginners because I was able to get quick tips on different ways to shoot captivating photos.  By going straight to the settings on the camera (and not explaining the different mathematics or science behind it), Kelby made it a lot easier (& more fun!) to get into the different types of shots.<br /><br />Just be careful -- I along with probably everyone else that has read this is now yearning for a DSLR so that I can have better control over my photos!
B000FQ4M58|4.0|It took several listenings for me to start enjoying this album, but once it catches hold of you it becomes addicting -- like the other 2 BOOH  albums.  Not quite as good as the other 2, but definitely worth listening to and owning.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|The presentation was captivating.The visuals were an added plus.The information provided cannot be denied. Finally, someone brought out in a clear and precise manner what is really taking place on this planet and what needs to happen, NOW! If only we will listen, while there is still time. Very well arranged,and Al Gore is quite the motivational speaker.
B000IOM0YM|1.0|This item colud be really cool (even 5 stars) but when I tryied to watch it I had a very bad surprise: I live in Italy and It wasn't a DVD working in Europe Zone. Actually it was a DVD's Zone \\"1\\", working only in the USA. <br />I'm just wondering why there wasn't any information about this characteristic (the advertising on Amazon's is exposing that it's an NTSC DVD but there is no information about the zone). <br />In the past two years I bought from Amazon's other items like this and even though they where in NTSC video standard they were in the DVD's ZONE \\"0\\" that is working in all over the world. <br />So this time this purchase for me is good only for litter. <br />Thank You. <br />
0805066349|5.0|This historical account is so educational because it documents so many of the quotes and facts that it is impossible to dispute what is presented.  The pictures of the people involved really is a great addition to the book.  Have you ever had a history book that is so well written and interesting that you can't put it down?  This is one of those.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|I didn't their second album could be as good as their first only because the first album was excellent.  I was wrong, The Open Door was just as good if not better than their debut album.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|I've heard it said that An Ancient Muse is just \\"more of the same\\" from Loreena.   <br />I say, that's ridiculous. <br /> <br />For years and years I listened to Eric Clapton play the notes of the blues.  He could play the notes, yet it always seemed to me that he was missing the SOUL of the blues.  But then his son died.  And when I first heard Eric play Change the World a few years after that tragedy, I remember saying to myself, \\"Now THAT is the blues.\\"  Don't misunderstand me, I wouldn't wish that loss and pain on anybody, but that event profoundly affected Eric's heart and soul, and it showed in his music. <br /> <br />For somebody as sensitive as Loreena, how could the events of the past 7 seven years NOT pierce her to the core?  The deaths of her fiancé and friends, and her travels through the conflict-torn Middle East. <br /> <br />Oh yes, this album is VERY different from her previous releases. <br /> <br />Her voice has never been more beautiful.  And yet there is a restrained and plaintive quality to it that I have never heard before.  Very different. <br /> <br />Also, I sense a more complete and somber maturity in An Ancient Muse than I sensed in her earlier work.  Very different. <br /> <br />This is an extremely thoughtful and carefully crafted production.  That much is not different from what we've come to expect from such an accomplished artist. <br /> <br />I have a playlist that I call Loreena's Power 15.   <br />[In no particular order: The Mystic's Dream; All Souls' Night; Samhain Night; She Moved Through the Fair; The Mummer's Dance; Marco Polo; Skellig; Night Ride Across the Caucasus; Stolen Child; La Serenissima; Dante's Prayer; The Highwayman; Bonny Portmore; Bonny Swans (live version); The Old Ways (live version)]   <br />Whenever I want to watch somebody who has never heard Loreena before, I play her Power 15 and watch their jaws drop in astonishment.  Heh. <br /> <br />Will any songs from An Ancient Muse take a place as a member of the Power 15?  I honestly can't say today.  I can't say because the songs from An Ancient Muse are so DIFFERENT. <br /> <br />I believe, though, that Caravanserai, The English Ladye and the Knight, Kecharitomene, Beneath a Phrygian Sky, Penelope's Song, and Never-Ending Road are all definite candidates.  Gosh, that's most of the songs on the entire album isn't it? <br /> <br />I think it was Martin Luther King who said something like, \\"We must learn to live as brothers or we'll all die together as fools.\\"  When I listen to Loreena sing Beneath a Phrygian Sky, I am deeply reminded of MLK's words. <br /> <br />There is only ONE reason that I am not giving this album Five Stars (well, I WANT to give it 4.5 stars, but since Amazon forces me to choose between 4 and 5, then I choose 5).  I feel an anguish in this album that I have never felt before from Loreena (very different).  [Just listen to those last notes of the bagpipes in Never-Ending Road.]  And that anguish troubles me. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000ICLHIE|5.0|If you are  a devotee of the post-modern cabaret song cycle that has been the bulk of Tom Wait's output since the early 80's, then this is material that you must have. This set transcends your typical gathering of dusty attic leftovers, lost recordings, and unfinished thoughts. A collective of mind bending proportions, that will dig deep into your psyche and fester for as long as own this album. If the packaging by Anti records is truly a limited edition, well then you better go out and get yourself one... today. Your subconscious will thank you.

B00000JXVK|5.0|I have been wanting a copy of this documentary since I first saw it in the theater when it was first released. I enjoyed the way it followed a season of racing the way it used to be. There were lots of humorous moments in the film, I lost concentration during the sand dunes segment and ran it in reverse to get back to the last place I remembered and watching it in reverse was a real hoot, I highly recommend it.
B000IHY9SE|1.0|I have been an Eminem fan for a long time, but I don't know what he was thinking when he released this crap. There are 2 songs on this CD that are good, and the rest all sound about the same and like crap. I hope he stops messing around with Kim and gets back to making good music that I know he is capable of making.

B000GCFO0I|2.0|I have never played the video game Silent Hill, and I am seriously weary of any adaptation of said games into movies because most of the time its like watching CGI paint dry. The only movie that has ever come close to mimicking the game, to me, was Resident Evil (the first one), and even then the special effects in CGI are poorly done. The actors that sign onto these movies usually don't give Oscar caliber performances, so I don't expect much.<br /><br />This movie gets 6 out of ten. It was entertaining, and its visuals while a bit over the top were still good (Heavy on the CGI, but in this case it was warranted). One Complaint here was that the child actor in this was seriously horrible. She looked the part, and that might be the reason she was cast, but it was excruciating listening and watching her. Another was that Alice Krige has no range as an actress and has just one \\"note\\" that being an evil smirking slow talking pale faced woman. The ending, with the barb wire was a complete rip off from Hell Raiser, even in such that Silent Hill alternates in between realities Hell/Reality.  If you are a fan of Games than watch it, if you are a fan of horror you will be disappointed, because there were no true scares here when you take into account how hard it is to suspend disbelief when dealing with CGI. Unless you're a complete Wuss.
B000I5X81A|1.0|Usually i love Eric Clapton's music but this one...sounded like a couple of guys sitting down to jam with no focus or direction... <br />Hokey, folky and simplistic. <br />Probably some die hard Clapton fan would love it but i was very disappointed.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|Johnny Depp is superb as the creator of Peter Pan.  This is a great movie for the whole family.
0790729628|4.0|Would have given 5 stars only there is no narration by Dekard, like the original.  Commentary overlap is not the same as the original narration.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|I love this show. This season was heart-pounding and tied right in with the last season. I completely recommend it and suggest it to anyone. Kristen Bell is a laugh out loud actress. She is so witty and smart. I think every girl wants to be just like Veronica Mars.
0156029065|3.0|Umberto Eco is known for creating difficult first chapters for his novels. If a person will not work through the first chapter of the book, then how can they be trusted to handle the complications of the remainder of the novel? This approach worked with The Name of the Rose and Foucalt's Pendulum because those novels were intelligent, clever and witty. It fails horribly in Baudolino. If you cannot make it through the child-Baudolino's first attempts at writing, do not worry too much - the rest of the novel isn't worth the effort. <br /> <br />Baudolino is 'adopted' at an early age by Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor, who was impressed by his ability to read and write. Later, Baudolino is sent to Paris to study, where he meets various people who function as both clear and veiled references to historical figures from the time. He returns to Frederick and is part of an honour guard until the monarch's death under mysterious circumstances. From there, his Paris friends and a few others head East to the mythical lands of Prestor John. Eventually he returns to Constantinople, where he meets Nicetas Choniates, a Greek historian and tells the story of his life. <br /> <br />If I have glossed over the plot, it is because ultimately, it does not matter. The novel may be split into two parts, the first of which is involves Frederick, the second concerning the 'Twelve Wise Men's journey to Prestor John's land, but it is more honest to discuss the novel based on its two themes - deceit and history. <br /> <br />It should first be noted that Eco is a tremendously intelligent man, with an astonishing thirty honorary doctorates from universities around the world. He is a famous medievalist, and uses this knowledge as a base for the environs and times of Baudolino. This is fine - he manages to throw enough history and clever 'in' jokes into the mix to show that he is a smart man. <br /> <br />Now to the first theme, deceit. We are told, early on and throughout the novel, that Baudolino is a liar. The text shows this quite often, though it is surprising to note that for a novel written in the first person, as narrated by Baudolino to Nicetas, there is virtually no introspection, no thoughtful analysis, no internal dialogue. Baudolino is a man of action, though the action is poor. <br /> <br />So, a liar. Baudolino happens to be present at various points of significant historical interest, and it is through his self-serving and self-interested machinations that history progresses. For us, the twenty-first century reader, this is clever, because we know the truth, as it were. But it is dishonest. Baudolino makes up a variety of events and items to prove the existence of Prestor John, including creating the Holy Grail from the drinking bowl of his dead father. We chortle because everyone back then was so superstitious, we chortle because the Grail is a Big Deal even day, but ultimately, the laughter is empty. What is the point of such deceit? Is it to consider ourselves more clever and better than the people of those times? Is it to believe that Baudolino himself is more clever than anyone else? If yes, why do we care? Baudolino is a personality-less archetype, that of the wanderer. As above, there are no insights into his thoughts or motives, and his adventures aren't exciting enough to excuse this omission. <br /> <br />To continue further: Baudolino was educated in Paris. He could read and write in many languages. He would have known the grand scale to which his deception would reach, and yet he was willing to deceive the Church. Why? His character showed no great dislike towards religion. The argument could be put forth that it was to further honour Frederick, to enhance his greatness but again, why? The character, as shown, does not display, in thought or word, much gratification for what Frederick did to him. It is too large a leap to expect the reader to believe that a man who, throughout the narrator of his story never really praises his adopted father, would go to such world-changing lengths for him. <br /> <br />The second theme involves mythology. Eco draws heavily from the Nuremberg Chronicles, an early illustrated world history that is one of the best surviving examples of an early printed book. The Nuremberg Chronicles is filled with all manner of wondrous creatures: the skiapod, with its one great foot that it uses to hope along at tremendous speeds; the blemmyes, or people who have no head but a face in their chest, and so forth. <br /> <br />Baudolino encounters these and many other mythical creatures throughout his travels. Can we believe him? No. But, that isn't necessarily a bad thing. In the hands of a good author, mythological creatures are just fine. And Eco is a good author, right? No, not in this novel. He describes the weird and wonderful creatures, and then they become little more than jokes. Only one, a skiapod named Gavagai, develops a personality, but it is a joke personality. He speaks in stilted, child-like dialogue, and functions primarily as a guide throughout the world of monsters. <br /> <br />I suppose it is nice that Eco is writing a novel that draws heavily from the Nuremberg Chronicles, just as I suppose it is nice that he weaves history and myth into his story of the 13th century, but the question that must be asked is: Why am I bothering reading this book? <br /> <br />At the end we find out. A character says, 'in a great history little truths can be altered so that the greater truth emerges.', and the text of the novel supports this. Does it matter that Baudolino lied about probably everything that ever happened to him? No, it does not. If a greater truth is revealed, it doesn't matter how many lies are told. But Eco has no greater truth. The idea that history changes based on our perception is not new, nor is it worthy of devoting an entire book. <br /> <br />Perhaps the worst part of this novel is that there are other authors who write historical fiction better than this. Generally, a lot of what is written is pulpy, but the authors usually provide a strong plot, strong characters, and no end of excitement. Take that away, and we have a history book. Sadly, Eco doesn't even provide this, because the history we have is too full of lies, and what is true is not fully explained. In the end, we have a book that could have been done better by almost anyone, and which has virtually no reason to exist whatsoever. Eco is a better writer than this book shows.
0790729644|5.0|This movie is my favorite of Clint Eastwood's films. It is certainly one of the best westerns ever filmed as well. As others have already written, it is dark, rich in both visuals and in characters. Eastwood's character is really a anti-hero lost in who he is and seems to be looking for a bit of redemption. <br /> <br />Totally worth every penny. I was fortunate enough to have been working at a theater when this movie was released and for the many nights, weeks, and months that it was shown, I watched every minute of it I could. As nice as it is to watch a movie in the luxury of one's own home, nothing can compare to a movie like this on the big screen. I sorely miss those days.
B0000TG9E2|5.0|I chose this edition because I try to purchase only authentic Disney movies, which are sometimes hard to find.

B000FP2OPY|5.0|I admit, there have been several well written television shows over the past few years in this category.  The witches, vampires and demons have been entertaining but lacked that extra something.  Supernatural is actually scary!  I've not seen another show that I would classify as \\"horror\\" made for weekly television.  The episodes are well written, and acted as such to be entirely believable.  I recommend Supernatural for all those who remember what it was like to be scared before blood and gore took over the big screen and sitcoms ruled television.
B000J10ERO|4.0|When I saw the trailers, I wanted to see this movie.  I talked about it incessantly and finally my friends caved and we went to a late night showing.  I was tired after a long day of work, but I was pleasantly surprised with the film.  Not blown away, mind you, but I liked it.  My friends, on the other hand, hated it and ruthlessly attacked everything from the \\"boring\\" plot to Brandon Routh's \\"horrible\\" portrayal.   <br /> <br />Well-rested and without expectations, I watched Superman Returns again last week and this time, I WAS blown away. Initially, I had thought the New Krypton business was a little over the top, but upon seeing it again, it really wasn't.  Initially, I had thought that Brandon Routh wasn't the best actor, but upon seeing it again, I saw that he was a lot better than I remembered. His portrayal of Clark Kent is not quite as bumbling as Christopher Reeve's, but I found it subdued and humble enough. And when he dons the suit, he automatically exudes confidence. Initially, I had thought that Kate Bosworth was the absolute wrong choice for the role, but upon seeing it again, I realized that she wasn't all that bad (but believe me, I still have problems where she is concerned).  I truly loved the style of the film, one that exuded a very sleek and classic look.  It was different from Spider-Man, which is more contemporary and really could take place in present-day New York.  It was also very much different from Batman Begins in that even though there is a certain degree of Superman/Clark Kent introspection, the two really don't compare.  Overall, I just thought this movie was fun! It really makes you wish we had someone like him around! <br /> <br />I will say a few words about the DVD...I loved the special features! There are around 3 hours of special footage spanning from Bryan Singer's initial meetings about a script (before they even had the okay from WB) to choosing a Superman to their final day of principle photography.  It's very well done andtouches pretty much every aspect of making the film (although not so much on the special effects part, but that was okay with me).  And allow to me a fan girl for a minute and say that it includes a lot of great footage of Brandon..but besides that! Essentially, a guy with a camera followed the production, so it includes lots of interviews and candid situations with basically every cast member, so I highly recommend it.  It's quite funny too!

0060853980|5.0|Good Omens is, currently, my single favorite piece of modern literature. The scathing wit of Terry Pratchett coupled with the deep narrative of Neil Gaiman is nothing short of perfection--particularly if you are familiar with any of the source material this book is working with. The off-kilter view on religion and the occult will definitely resonate with an open-minded person with any religious background.
B000I0QK74|5.0|Have loved James Taylor for many, many years now...since 1970 in junior high!  Now we have his Christmas CD to love.  Thank you, JT, et al.!
B000IU3XU6|5.0|I've had Awake since it came out on November 7 and now that I've had time to listen to it a good hundred times, I'm here to tell you that I love it not just because it's new and exciting, but because it is his BEST YET.   <br /> <br />My initial fear with this album was that it was going to get ripped apart by the critics for having such a wide variety of songs and really no commonality other than Josh's amazing performances.  Thankfully, that hasn't happened too much.  I find the approach he took with this album as a refreshing change of pace and direction.  Looking back, his eponymous debut sounds just as the cover looks: gray and dull.  Don't get me wrong, I love the songs, but when I listen to them, there really isn't a song that gets my toe tapping (with the slight exception of \\"Canto Alla Vita\\").  Those songs seem like they are all sad ballads.  Then we have Closer, which reflects the cover in that he definitely has more flavor.  Songs like \\"Remember When it Rained\\" and \\"Never Let Go\\" exude a new style for Josh, one that transcends the foreign language ballads of \\"Per Te,\\" \\"Caruso,\\" \\"Hymne a l'amour,\\" \\"Mi Mancherai,\\" etc.  And now we have Awake, an album that truly reflects Josh's interests and is a product straight from his hands.   <br /> <br />With \\"Mai,\\" Josh continues with his pattern of unique and slightly funky opening tracks and the orchestration is truly superb.  \\"You Are Loved (Don't Give Up)\\" is currently my favorite song out of all three albums for three reasons: the lyrics, the falsetto, and the story behind it.  Josh has said that he heard this song at a time when he needed to hear it, so there is a certain personal quality to the song.  \\"Un Dia Llegara\\" is once more a foreign language ballad, but a much more mature and seasoned performance than ever before.  \\"February Song\\" is a song that Josh wrote and while beautiful, the lyrics offer a whole slew of interpretations.  The lyrics aside, Josh's performance is truly heartfelt. \\"L'Ultima Notte\\" isanother ballad, but it is beautiful and like \\"Un Dia,\\" it offers a much more mature Josh.  \\"So She Dances\\" came as a surprise and the tinkling notes remind me of a music box.  It really doesn't compare with anything we have seen before.  \\"In Her Eyes\\" is, let's face it, a rock song, and I LOVE it! It is the easiest melody to get stuck in my head and the lyrics are beautiful.  It's great to hear Josh act his age!  \\"Solo Por Ti\\" wasn't my favorite when it debuted, but I have grown to love it for its simplicity.  It also demonstrates this burgeoning maturity in Josh and his voice (who knew his voice could go that low?).  \\"Now Or Never\\" is a song that seems to shout, \\"Hello, people! I'm 25 and not Pavarotti!\\" thanks to his collaboration with the talented, but musically different, Imogen Heap. It's a very modern approach, but fun.  While Josh's voice seems to just make an appearance in \\"Un Giorno per Noi,\\" it is still a fantastic song.  The cello solos are beautiful and Josh provides some incredible vocal theatrics.  \\"Lullaby\\" IS a lullaby. Showcasing more falsetto, this song really could put you to sleep (but in a good way!).  I have to admit that \\"Weeping\\" is my least favorite song on the album.  When I heard a clip months and months ago I thought it was awesome, but it has gotten the fewest listens and I can't quite explain why.  Then there's \\"Machine,\\" a song that I was initially terrified to hear because it just sounded so different.  But I love it now.  It sounds like Josh had a blast recording this song and I love the energy (not to mention that AWESOME brass part towards the end).  Someone mentioned that \\"Verita\\" sounded familiar and I wholeheartedly agree, but I can't figure out what exactly.  Just like the other foreign language ballads, it demonstrates his maturity, but I would have to say it's my favorite of the four.  Then there's \\"Awake,\\" a beautiful song Josh wrote to his family and one that can easily bring me and many other people to tears because of its sincerity and relatability. <br /> <br />Overall, this album is a beautiful array of songs that runs the risk of alienating some of the diehard foreign-language fans, but that's really just their loss.  It really exposes the audience to new types of music, not to mention an insight into Josh's creative process.  \\"Machine\\" is his response to getting thrown into the system of the music business today where a singer is given a bunch of similar-sounding songs that the studio wants.  He didn't want that overbearing interference and that's why he took this album into his own hands and crafted a product that exhibits HIM and not the studio.  Kudos for standing up for yourself, Josh. <br /> <br />And a quick word on the DVD...if you have never before seen Josh in concert or on any of the other dvds, get this.  When it is just him and a camera he just can't seem to stop himself from cracking a joke or doing something silly that makes you laugh.  I'll tell you that I will never be able to hear the words \\"It's your Mom!\\" again without smiling and hysterically laughing! And that's why we love him!
B000JBWWBK|5.0|We had seen the movie, A Good Year, and fell in love with it and the scenery but especially the soundtrack. Thus, I checked on Amazon and located the CD of the same for my sister as a Christmas gift. We have played the music so much already and enjoy it tremendously.
B00011F5DK|5.0|Blokus is a great game for elementary school-aged kids. They must be good with shapes and spatial relationships since they have to fit different size blocks onto the board. This game is really fun since you not only have to work fast, but can also work offensively, trying to block the other player from moving. My 9 year old beats me at this 90% of the time--which he loves!
B000ICLHIE|5.0|I would highly recommend this album to old fans and new. The first album is a collection of fun upbeat- rock and rollers- album 2 is a collection of some of the most beautiful I have ever heard! And Album 3 is a mix. My kids- 16-13 and 10 have all become fans for life! Both of my brothers are hard core fans- and they also feel that this is his best work yet! -
0618680004|5.0|Dawkins does a wonderful job of taking on all of the arguments Christians like to make in an effort to get atheists to pretend to accept ideas that simply don't make sense.  He does not apologize for being honest, skeptical, or rational, and he suggests we do likewise.   <br /> <br />While none of his arguments are new, his science is on the mark, and he makes the arguments in a simple and concise way that lay people can understand.  This is an excellent book for those who are sometimes put in the unenviable position of having to argue with a religious person.
B000I5X81A|5.0|The music is great if you like either or both of these guys.  Early reviews has it EC had to add JJ since most were Cale's tunes.  That being said, the two are great together and there are several really catchy tunes you'll play in your head all day long.  Highly recommended...
B000H5U832|5.0|This was an extremely entertaining movie for both the kids (boys 3 and 4) and adults alike. Had a great Chritsmas watching with them.  Glad to find it in the full screen version, couldn't get much but the widescreen one at our local Wal-Mart and with free shipping, your price was better than theirs - so good all the way around.
B000HBKCDC|4.0|Sarah sounds great on this CD.<br /><br />I just wish she had done more songs with more of a gospel feel.<br /><br />I just love her voice so much I wanted MORE!<br /><br />This CD is a GREAT addition to your holiday music collection.<br /><br />ANd when it comes to Sarah, how can you go wrong?<br /><br />You can't!<br /><br />I am sure you will be satisfied.
B000J103PC|5.0|a very good movie i watch it over and over again, and never tire really recommend it
B000H0MKGK|5.0|This is the greatest CD.  I've listened to it a million times already!!
1556347308|5.0|<br />The \\"Gurps 4th Edition\\" just fixed all \\"Gurps 3rd Edition\\" weakness. The two books are so great. The color and hardcover look and feel are some big diference between the books and the the old versions.  <br /> <br />The bad comercial thing: are two books, and you need to have both if you want to be a Game Master.  <br /> <br />The \\"Characters Guide\\" have lots of resources to make a rich character and the \\"Campaigns Guide\\" have a good Game Master stuff. <br /> <br />If you want to have some good RPG System, well, you need to buy \\"Gurps 4th Edition\\", but you need some time and practice, cause the game system is so rich, then the rules number is high. <br />
B000FTWB7G|5.0|I absolutely love Evanescence.  Amy Lee has such an angelic voice.  This record simply shows more of her wonderful talents.
0525457585|5.0|I can't rate the speed of the dilvery since it was Christmas gift to me and I never got to know when it came in. However the book is beautiful and I can't wait to start to read it.
0805047905|5.0|I got this book when I was pregnant with my son, now three years old.  It has always been a favorite of his.  Although he can't read yet, he knows the words as he turns each page.  He loves to read this book to his sister, so I'm sure it will become one of her favorites too.
B000000Y87|5.0|Anything Bill Evans plays is wonderful! I love his style of playing. This music is so calming.
0060888695|5.0|This version is almost as good as the one narrated by Roses Pritchard. It seems to move at a slower pace and lack the dynamic quality of the other version.  Still, it is To Kill a Mockingbird and you can't go wrong with that.
B000000OTY|4.0|This is in the cream of the crop for all live musical performances. <br />The band here is far superior to the \\"Growing Up\\" tour, regardless of  <br />your preference for material.  Absolutely get it. You won't be  <br />disappointed. Here's the \\"but\\". But if you still have your hifi VCR  <br />working, I'd highly recommend you get it.  The dvd was remixed/remastered <br />when made to dvd.  What was gained was some audio detail in the  <br />instrumentation (so good) that aren't clearly audible on the VCR version. <br /> <br />But I lived with the tape for years before the dvd was released and it should be told, if it has not been elsewhere here. <br /> <br />  One of the things that was gained on the dvd version was poor resolution.  Dark or moderately stagelit segments look badly pixelated. Also, the audio track, perhaps through the remixing, is not always in synch.  These problems don't occur on the VCR tape.  Furthermore, though I was already wowed by Paula Cole by her \\"Harbinger\\" album (maybe her best) previous to the release of this tape, as was Gabriel when he went  <br />to her to tour with them I have read.  Her performance here is stunning.  She looks great and her performance is powerful enough to nearly steal the show or at some thunder from PG, and that takes some doing. Maybe some bad blood or PG just decided she was doing just fine on her own by the time the dvd was produced.   <br /> <br /> On the dvd remix she's been \\"restrucured\\"  to be a background singer, regardless of what appears to be happening on stage.  <br />If I had to make a choice, I'd take the tape for the better video quality <br />and the undiminished Paula Cole performance-night and day difference. <br />But if it doesn't break the bank, get the dvd, too.  There are just enough instrumental goodies brought to light that it's also enjoyable. <br />Together they get 5.5 stars. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0307120007|3.0|I bought this book for my daughter for Christmas.  I read all of the reviews and thought that it must be a really nice and special book.  The book is okay, but for the price, I expected more.  It's spiral-bond and not very good quality.  I highly doubt that it will hold up to the use of a small child.
1892005034|5.0|The product is great.  It took nearly three weeks to receive it which to me is a long time.  DHL sent it to some place in Utah or Idaho.  When it finally was sent to Albuquerque they shipped it USPS.  It would have been better to ship it USPS in the first place.  I would have received it sooner.  The last time I ordered from Amazon the merchandise came in very good time.  This time was a disappointment.   <br /> <br />Thank you for listening..
B000FTWB7G|3.0|While I like the Evanescence sound, it seemed that all the songs sounded roughly the same. It'd be cheaper to buy one or two off of iTunes.
0740748475|5.0|If you are an Clavin and hobbes fan, you must have this collection. its  <br />very good....
B000ICL3KG|5.0|My favorite Documentary of all time.  Why?  Because unlike other documentaries that point fingers at problems, this one actually provides a solution and a strong hope for humanity.
B00005S6K8|5.0|I'm an old movie die-hard fan but I have to say that this one is better than the original. Julie Ormond makes a woderful, believable, enchanting Sabrina, but most of all Harrison Ford is delicious. The mother, David (Greg Kinnear), the secretary, all make this movie a classic. You'll be quoting it and pulling it out for a feel-good movie.
B000FTWB7G|4.0|I thought that \\"Evanescence\\"'s new album was great overall with only a couple of minor flaws to speak of. (in my opinion of course) One of which, was that to me it just lacked a certain something that \\"Fallen\\" had tons of, and while it was good it just seemed like Amy Lee and band weren't giving it their all on this album when it came to putting the songs together (\\"Call Me When You're Sober\\" and a couple others excluded). Even with these flaws it is still worth every penny, especially if you're a fan, and I give it a 4 star rating.
B00006JSS8|5.0|Fantastic collection of Stevie's most well-known works.  Also love the first cut - unpredicted and fun!
B000002H70|5.0|Love the Cure, enough said.  This is their best album, and anyone looking for some music when they just want to be in the dark, it's a great pick.
B000GRUS22|5.0|This is one of the most relaxing and intriguing CD for Enigma. Awesome music.
B000002KKD|5.0|The B-52s:  quirky, different, difficult to classify musically.  Is it pop?  Or rock?  Or maybe something else? <br /> <br />Who cares!  This is fun music!  You'll find no serious message here.  These songs won't cause the U.S. to sign worldwide accords regulating the production of CFCs; they won't feed a child in Africa; and they won't initiate peace in the Middle East.  What they will do is make you forget about a world in which those things are a concern for awhile.  The B-52s' world is filled with off-beat characters, including aliens (\\"Planet Claire\\"), obssessed girlfriends (\\"Hero Worship\\"), and feared crustaceans. Does anyone not love \\"Rock Lobster\\"?  (Witness Peter Griffen's acoustic version on an episode of TV's \\"Family Guy.\\")  Yes, there are strong sexual overtones.  But, hey, isn't all pop/rock music about that these days?  At least the B-52s lyrics are so cached in metaphors, there's no explicity.  (\\"Uh-oh!  Lookout!  It's about to erupt!... Lava.  Hot Lava.\\")  If you have problems with metaphors of \\"negative\\" content, I suggest you look up the origins of those nursery rhymes you teach your kids.  Gee whiz.  It's all in fun. <br /> <br />I keep this debut album (and the B-52s' second one, Wild Planet) in my car and on my iPod at all times.  If you want serious music, go listen to Lucia di Lammermoor.  If you want fun time, feel good, party music, get the B-52s.
0743201140|5.0|We purchased this for our management team as a way to get to know each others strengths and to find out better how to work with each other.  What a great resource to have.  It is making a difference in our team work.
0553260111|3.0|I have this theory that the film and publishing business is dominated by the demands of the airline industry. Such fare has to be generally undemanding and mildly diverting, to take one's mind off the waiting in departure lounges and the subsequent firings through the air in tubes of metal, packed in like sardines (if The Almighty had not meant us to fly, He would not have given us in-flight movies). Mildly diverted by the second Bourne film of the same name (seen, yes! on a flight), starring Matt Damon, I thought I'd try the first book, having first rented the first film.<br /><br />It has to be remembered that the book is much older than the film, and written when there still existed a Soviet Union and a super-terrorist Carlos (\\"The Jackal\\"), so the plots of film and book have in common really only the mysterious Jason Bourne, plucked from the sea full of bullet holes and with no memory of, well, anything - and who finds out very soon that the world is apparently full of people who remember him only too well and are out to erase both him and his memory completely. He also finds that he is full of interesting abilities in the more destructive arts. It's quite a nice twist on the usual secret agent thriller, as Bourne fights with both his external enemies and  his internal demons, things that hover on the periphery of his consciousness, maddeningly (almost literally) just out of reach.<br /><br />The story is well told but just a little bit too pat. How likely is it that an amnesiac would find an ally in a woman (beautiful and beddable naturally) who is also a financial whiz, just the thing he needs for the banks with which he must deal? And is it so easy is it for two strangers in Switzerland to find a doctor who will treat bullet wounds and say nothing to the local constabulary? As is usually the case with such thrillers, there is much detail that has to be taken on trust (the workings of private banks), and that are there probably only to give a verisimilitude of accuracy, but which are only peripheral to the story and do not need to be mastered, the way one can drive a car without knowing how a gearbox works. My confidence in Mr. Ludlum was shaken somewhat by seeing Lenzburg, the substantial town through which I pass every day on my way to work, described as \\"a village outside Z&uuml;rich\\", and the Paris police described as \\"gendarmes\\".<br /><br />Flaws aside, the book is, like the film, mildly diverting, with the big BANG! WHAM! climax standard for such books, in which Carlos (just) gets away, thus leaving the door open for sequels. In all, just the thing for those long, boring flights. There are (I think) two other Bourne books. Will I read them? Depends on when is the next long flight...de of accuracy, but which are only peripheral to the story and do not need to be mastered, the way one can drive a car without knowing how a gearbox works.

B000ATQYT2|5.0|As a long-time fan of the Muppets and their Christmas special, I highly recommend this DVD!  It offers clarity of sound and sharpness of picture which will allow you to see all of the special Jim Henson characters performing comical actions in the deep background.<br /><br />Michael Caine is especially wonderful in this as Ebeneezer Scrooge and Kermit the Frog does his best as usual.  But perhaps the show stealers are Rizzo the Rat and Gonzo (who plays Charles Dickens).  They are hilarious as the narrators who follow the action throughout the show---at least until the \\"Ghost of Christmas Future\\" shows up.<br /><br />So go ahead and add this one to your collection and see how Scrooge learns a lesson that Jesus teaches his followers...\\"Love your neighbor as yourself.\\"
032147404X|4.0|I just bought my first DSLR and though not unfamiliar with some picture taking tecniques....it was refreshing to read more and learn more about getting the best of your DSLR. <br />In easy to understand language.....and cutting to the point without all the Techie mumbo jumbo.....it helped me learn more and get out and start shooting a lot faster..........now i have to just learn ,not to be tempted to buy all the accesories discribed in the book.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|What a terrific collection of classic Beatles.  I resisted at first - as a true believer I questioned the wisdom of re-mixing the celestial music.  But this is so well done that it made me appreciate the music again and in a whole new way.  Also, the  first track is the best album opener ever - I challenge anyone NOT to car dance when Ringo's drums kick in.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This is my current favorite movie. It's Pride & Prejudice with more substance. The actors are wonderful. The story is so good. I can't get enough of it. Sent it to my friends too.
B00003CXB4|2.0|This DVD does work but skips at times.  We are able to watch it, but I am very dissapointed in AMazon for allowing people to sell things that don't work correctly.
6305428042|5.0|My girls loved this movie when it first came out and still enjoy it today.
B00003CXA2|5.0|This came in good condition and I received it quickly.  I would buy from this seller again.  Thank you.
1400044162|4.0|This book tells the story of a well off and young Nigerian woman before and during the Biafran war with all the human tragedies. Increased vastly my understanding of Africa and Nigeria in particular. I got very interested in Africa because of it. The story is easy to follow but also very realistic. A must for somebody who wants to know more about the conditions in Africa.
0446528056|5.0|This book is an easy read. It has the same elements of all of his other books.  If you like Nicholas Sparks, you will like this book.
B000JFXTHC|5.0|I am amazed how Enya just gets better and better. Her voice on this cd is perfect and the tracks are amazing. For any Enya fan, or fan of good music I suggest you go out and buy this album, it is simply the best.

B0002W18MU|5.0|Johnny Cash took the time to look over all types of music. He wasn't stuck on singing only his own lyrics or staying with \\"country music\\". These songs that Rick Rubin has assembled represent just some of the songs that Cash felt were worth recording. What an honor for Springsteen or Cohen to have one of their's chosen. Each songwriter can say that Johnny listened and then put his own mark on the song. Yes, the voice is not as strong as it was when Johnny was on Sun Records, but the power is still there.  <br /> <br />Any music collection should have all of the American Recording albums that Johnny Cash has done.
B000JJRIP2|5.0|I'm from Germany, so please excuse my bad english. First of all, I'm a Fan since early 1979 when Alive II and the Solo Albums were the actual stuff. I like Hardrock and here in the Box Set are the best Examples of KISS included. Obviously I had all the available Live-Albums allready but because of the included Alive 4 Concert it was clear to purchase the Box also! All Concerts are in good quality, the Booklet and the Box is nice! <br />Hardcore KISS Fans will have it allready, but for new ones here you get a Live Journey with the hottest Ban from 1975 to 2000 for the Best Price! <br />Only bad point is that the 2 additional Songs from Alive 4 were here not available. But still 5 Stars!  <br />You won't get fooled...let the curtain drop and enjoy....
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|Excellent product.  Does the job very well.  Our prof. at business school mentioned that he has been using this instrument for several years now and I can see why.

B000ICLHIE|5.0|One of America's great poets.  His epic odyssey of faith, truth and struggle.
0895260131|5.0|Very informative book written in a clear and concise manner. Well researched and full of references, it dispels some of the myths that have been propagated over the last few decades. Important book for someone to understand what is going on in the world today.
B00005MP58|5.0|This version of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is so engaging and well acted that the length of the movie goes unnoticed.  As an Austen enthusiast, I like to see portrayals of her works that involve the entire story and the intricate nuances of the characters.  I feel that the actors in this version present the complicated interplay of emotions and miscommunications intended by Austen.  It's a splendid work of romantic drama.
B000GFLE86|5.0|Another great album form Madeleine displaying her vocal agility.  <br />Comfortable singing with others, KD Lang is a great example.  <br /> <br />This album is good to listen to anytime of day not just late a night with a loved one but that helps!!
B00005JNS0|5.0|Excellent price!  I got it for less than originally marked!  Thank you!
B000AL5OZK|5.0|I recenetly purchased the remastered version of the album and I say that its worth waiting for. The Duet Never Again with Agnetha and Tomas Ledin is EXCELLENT. The other bonus tracks were a surprise and they were excellent too. I say that this album remaster is worth the wait.
B000000WFZ|5.0|I am a lover of classical music and often am more interested in good music in a movie than the storyline.  This one is superb!  I have it programmed into my MP3 player, too.
B00004YZFR|4.0|Once upon a time, long ago, the Rolling Stones were at the cutting edge of rock both musically and culturally.  THis film is of thir US tour of 69 when they ruled where ever they played.  But it wasn't enough.  An apparant murder in the crowd was filmed at a poorly organised concert near the end of the tour and became the anti-Woodstock: the day the dream of rock saving the world had to be put away.  this film brillantly contrasts the Stones apparantly invincible power on the stage with their vagueness and ineffectuality off it.  A true classic of documentary film-making.
0060254920|5.0|My Granddaughter jumped with joy when she received her own copy of this book. The day care has the same book, and all I kept hearing about was how much she wanted this book for Xmas. Even though she is only 4 years old, within two weeks she had most of the text memorized.
0060872675|5.0|Terry Pratchett and the illustrator do an awesome job bringing a part of the Discworld series into reality.  My youngest thought it was strange the first time we read it to her.  Now she asks for it at least once a week.  If you've never read any Discworld, go get the Colour of Magic and have fun.
B000HEWEEY|5.0|The item I purchased was a Christmas present for my father-in-law.  I had it shipped directly to him in Kansas.  However, when it was opened the packaging was not sufficient to keep the item I purchased from getting CRUSHED.  This was a rather expensive purchase and considered a \\"collector's edition\\" I was not 100% satisfied with the way the item arrived.

032147404X|5.0|Scott Kelby is not only a good and very entertaining writer, but has also given us a simple, direct, and clear guide to good photography.  He skips the arcane technical discussions and just tells you how to get the shot you want under specific conditions.  There is a chapter for just about everything, although the book is fairly short.  For me, his book is like having a more experienced photographer on hand to help me get the most out of my digital SLR.  I have given this book as a gift as well, and the recipients say the same thing.  I'd say the book is aimed at \\"advanced beginners\\", but anyone could benefit from Kelby's wisdom and experience shared here.  Buy it.
B0002SROT0|5.0|I highly recommend this to anyone who is very chill in their musical preferences, and or diverse. It is different to listen to at first but eventually its completely relaxing. Elliot Smith is kind of a rock/metal mindset accompanied with a soft acoustic feel, absolutely excellent.
0300108834|5.0|This book was written for children, I am not a child.  However this is a great overview of the history of the world.  In my attempt to classicaly educate myself I decided that before learning intimate details of certain periods I should have a broader sense of world history.  This book delivers, in terms anyone can understand. Gombrich is a genius and a great man.
B00011F5DK|5.0|We started out with Travel Blokus, which is a great game for 2 people, although I don't think it would actually be very easy to play while traveling, and once a small piece is lost, the game would no longer be playable. The regular Blokus can be played by 2 people simply by marking the board to the dimensions of Travel Blokus, since the playing pieces are identical. <br /> <br />I have played this game with another adult, with a 10 year old and with a mix of adults and kids, and it's fun and different every time - kind of addictive, actually. Individual games go fairly quickly, depending on how many people are playing.

B000HIVO64|4.0|Beck's 2005 venture GUERO proved to be a so penned \\"return to form\\" for Beck, at least where the closest sounding-album to Beck's bestselling breakthrough, album of the year nominated ODELAY was concerned.  GUERO was indeed well received garnering Beck an amazing first week of 162,000 and a very spectacular #2 bow.  GUERO went on to sell over 800,000 copies and while it wasn't certified platinum, it is Beck's bestselling next to the double-platinum ODELAY.  If GUERO was a so penned \\"return to form\\" for Beck (not looking down on any of Beck's releases as they are all exceptional), then THE INFORMATION is a more creative, experimental extension of that.  Perhaps the best way to categorize THE INFORMATION is that it is a \\"greatest hits\\" of all of Beck's best strategies;  it is the complete Beck in one album.  Unfortunately, sales were dismal of THE INFORMATION, though it did manage a first week #7 bow with 99,000 (off 63,000 from GUERO). Despite dismal sales, the quality of THE INFORMATION is certainly top rate, as all Beck albums tend to be.<br /><br />\\"Elevator Music\\" proves to be an exceptional opener to THE INFORMATION.  While the drums don't have the exact same hip-hop feel as \\"E-Pro\\", there is definitely a killer groove there that makes you bob your head.  \\"Elevator Music\\" definitely is a mix between folk-rock with a semi-hip-hop/rock beat providing the rhythmic feel. As awkward as Beck's MC skills may seem, there is something certainly endearing about him as an MC-- or maybe it's just that \\"Elevator Music\\" just feels \\"in the pocket\\".<br /><br />\\"Think I'm In Love\\" is this album's \\"Girl\\" because it has the same kind of folk, indie-rock/pop feel.  This track feels like it belongs in the psychedelic rock of the 1960s. Again, Beck outdoes himself and makes the first track \\"Elevator Music\\" completely seperate and different then \\"Think I'm In Love\\".  \\"Cellphone's Dead\\" is a definite show stealer on THE INFORMATION, especially with its sampling of Herbie Hancock's fusion classic \\"Chameleon\\".  I love the way that the introduction of the song, which reappears throughout, throws you off from the main music material within the song.  Also, the lady's vocal performance definitely gets stuck in your head as she sings \\"one by one I'll knock you out\\".  The production is among the best that I've heard on any Beck song and proves true that THE INFORMATION is a definite production showcase if nothing else.  However, Mr. Hanson sounds as good doing the MC thing or singing as he ever has nearing 40 years old.  Forget the \\"aging hipster\\" thing, he's as relevant as ever if not moreso.<br /><br />\\"Strange Apparition\\" resurrects a folk-rock feel once again with Beck playing into that feel to a \\"tee\\".  The piano within the production is perfect coupled with the acoustic guitars to execute this feel.  Also, Beck is into throwing \\"curve balls\\" as toward the end of \\"Strange Apparition\\" the feel completely changes.  Who said music can't be unpredictable? \\"Soldier Jane\\" isn't as stunning as the preceeding tracks, but it is solid nonetheless, though not a show stealer by any means.  The interspersed synth lines within \\"Soldier Jane\\" do a good job contrasting the dryer-indie feel of the track making for yet another artistic Beck statement.  \\"Nausea\\" resurrects some of the feel of \\"E-Pro\\", only without the Dust Brothers beat.  There is a busy groover underlying \\"Nausea\\" making for a very \\"exotic\\" listen.  The chorus of \\"Nausea\\" is certainly catchy and the guitars coupled with all the synthesizer lines and etc.. make \\"Nausea\\" the incredibly fun, though brief track that it is.<br /><br />\\"New Round\\" and \\"Dark Star\\" both serve up more innovative production work, and again Beck performs fine over the material.  Unfortunately, like some of the rest of THE INFORMATION, some of the material does feel a bit droll compared to the \\"top-rate\\" material.  While \\"Dark Star\\" is no \\"Cellphone is Dead\\" and the songwriting doesn't quite compare, the production slaughters and the harmonica solo and the synth strings come out of nowhere, hence confirming how great a musician Beck is.  \\"We Dance Alone\\" picks up the momentum with its electro-centric production and Beck once again putting his MC skills to work.  The drum programming and the DJ scratches here are great; I'd even venture to say that some rappers wish they had some \\"hot beats\\" like these to rap over.<br /><br />While \\"No Complaints\\" doesn't quite possess the freshness as some of the best tracks, but the rhythmic feel and the overall simplicity of the groove is great.  Beck sounds strong here and if for nothing else, you can't help but hit the repeat button on your CD player/iTunes library just to hear all the different sounds/synths Beck incorporates here.  \\"1000 BPM\\" is definitely a production standout, and certain the \\"out of the box\\" production of THE INFORMATION. It is among the most innovative thing that I've heard in all music, of any genre for a while.  It is tracks and music like \\"1000 BPM\\" that make me hope that music truly does have a new direction or a new level to ascend to as opposed to staying at the same place always.  Beck's almost \\"off-beat\\" vocals work very effectively here.<br /><br />\\"Motorcade\\" and \\"The Information\\" prove to be too dense, as some of the material on THE INFORMATION is.  Again, THE INFORMATION is a great album, but at times you do question if Beck indulges a bit much making THE INFORMATION slightly less accesible than Beck's other albums.  Worth noting is THE INFORMATION is much more \\"brainy\\" than GUERO in my opinion, which is both a blessing and in the slightest sense a curse, at least where commercial sales are concerned. \\"Movie Theme\\" proves to have this same indulgence, but the production is definitely ear-catching from the minute that you hear it and Beck's undertone folksy vocals are very much desired. \\"The Horrible Fanfare/Landslide/Exoskeleton\\" proves to be yet another production standout with all its intricacies intertwining together.  Again, maybe it is a bit much, even if you recognized the masterpiece that it is, but it is a fine enough way to end an overall masterpiece album.<br /><br />While generally speaking, THE INFORMATION got positive reviews, there were also an assortment of mixed or unfavorable reviews by some critics.  That notion isn't so far fetched because in some respects the great breadth and depth of THE INFORMATION makes it in some instances a bit inaccesible, at least from one non-analytical listen.  There are many discs like that, one being 2006's Tool release 10,000 DAYS, an album with a number of dense, lengthy numbers that don't endear you until repeated, intensely analytical listens.  The same could be said of prog-rockers The Mars Volta, whose recent album (AMPUTECHTURE) like Beck's fell from the top echolon of the charts very quickly.  However, in my eyes, THE INFORMATION was easily one of 2006 best albums as well as one of '06's most underrated and unappreciated albums as well.  Perhaps another gold plaque may eventually grace Beck with THE INFORMATION as it is deserving of much great accolades than that.  4 stars.slaughters and the harmonica solo and the synth strings come out of nowhere, hence confirming how great a musician Beck is.  \\"We Dance Alone\\" picks up the momentum with its electro-centric production and Beck once again putting his MC skills to work.

B000H5V8DG|5.0|I never watched the show when it aired originally. I started to watch the reruns and got into it. However, I could not figure the timeline. I bought all five seasons and had a great time watching every episode from the first to the last. Sometimes I think maybe Rambaldi is real. Full of constant suspence and surprises. Being a language buff myself, I never knew that anyone could speak so many languages fluently like the character Sidney. <br />If you are into intrigue and a little new age stuff or Nostradomus then I highly reccomend.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is the hands-down best version of Pride and Prejudice. Long--but long enough to capture the story in every detail, yet without being boring. This is the only period romance I know that men enjoy watching--every man I know that's watched it has loved it (even if they feel guilty about it. :) )<br /><br />I already own my own copy of this--I bought one for a friend for Christmas.  I cannot recommend it enough--it's my favorite movie of all time.
B00005JLIU|3.0|I bought the DVD to replace the VHS my VCR ate.  I love this movie, and so will anyone who enjoys a thoroughly silly premise.  Millie is a musical set in the twenties full of fantastic costumes, great dances, villians and wonderful situation comedy.  There unfortunately isn't much in the way of extras on the DVD, but the quality of the colors and sound make this DVD the perfect medium to view this film.
B000AMWIVM|4.0|I got the 2-disc DVD within a few days.  It was packaged well and I had no problems whatsoever with anything.  Thank you!
1878424777|5.0|I bought several copies of this CD set for my friends and family and I have listened to it many times while driving.  For those who are not great readers this is a great alternative and has the advantage for anyone that the more you listen the more the wisdom transfers into your unconscious.  I have used this strategy for several years and have noticed big changes at a practical level in my life.  Peter Coyote's voice is very easy to listen to and Miguel Ruiz writes in a very fluid style.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to develop themselves.
0446528056|3.0|The book did not meet my expectations.  I find myself comparing all his books to how I felt in \\"The Guardian\\" and nothing compares.  One sided account of a soldier that you don't connect with.
B0000AQS6R|5.0|This a great Holiday movie. It quickly became a tradition in my house to pop this movie in while decorating our tree. Laughter throughout.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This is a solid, carefully constructed presentation by Mr. Gore of the global warming issues. The selections from his lectures, interspersed with related snippets from his career, make for a strong visual presentation of his message. Perhaps his greatest accomplishment is to convey the serious scientific realities in language and visual aids that are understandable and important to the general audience. I was also impressed by the events from his past that helped form his commitment to this cause. It appears that Mr. Gore was disappointed with the lack of progress in this area during his political career, but this sense of loss now fuels his post-political activism. It's really an excellent presentation, a work that should stand as a classic as well as being immediately relevant.
B000EHSVQE|5.0|How many movies can you watch without foul language or smut and be enteretained on multiple levels? This is a movie that, the more you watch it, the more you like it. Even if you don't 'get it' with the first viewing, you'll appreciate it's humor the second time around.
B000I0QK74|5.0|What can i say about this cd that hasnt been said? I am always in awe at how timeless james music and style is. I can well here him doing these songs well into his seventies and perhaps eighties. Being a performer/singer/songwriter i find my music heavily influenced by his style and approach. If you havent seen him in concert you absolutley must. <br />James is one of the few artist who sounds as good or better then his recordings. Get his dvd \\"Live at the Beacon theatre\\"..Awesome!!!  <br /> <br />
1401917186|3.0|First I want to make clear, that if you haven't read Doreen's \\"Earth Angels\\" book, then this is the better addition to purchase because it has exactly what \\"Earth Angels\\" includes pluse a bit more information you will want to know. The only thing this newer addition leaves out is the chapter on walk-ins. Ultimately, they are inexpensive so purchasing both may be what you want to do if you wish to read about walk-ins. Let me add that this is a mini book so you could probably read about walk-ins standing at the book store.<br /><br />Further, for those expecting this new addition to be more than it turned out to be read on. I understand the book said it would contain old material as well as new, but I didn't think that meant repeating word for word in most cases, which is what I found to be true for this book. I was looking forward to lots new information about incarnated Mermaids, and so forth. Like the review written before mine, you can read the newly added details by standing in the book store. I'm glad it only cost $7, again feeling disappointed.<br /><br />I believe I was hoping as well as others who relished in the previous Earth Angels, for more information about their incarnated being qualities and the realms they come from. There is only one very short paragraph about Merangels, another short one for Merfairies and so forth. There is a little more information than the last book but only a little, including a few new realms about Knights and Leprechauns. Again, why didn't they just wait for more material before making a new book. I suppose it's worth it if you really want even the slightest bit more information about your realm (I guess like I did).<br /><br />I really don't understand how the Spiritually minded author and publishing company could come out with this book, when they knew how little new information it would contain. I believe they also thought all those who loved Earth Angels would buy it. I wish they would wait until there was significantly more information to publish instead of using only a little and throwing it in with the exact same material as the previous version.ish instead of using only a little and throwing it in with the exact same material as the previous version.
B000J10EQU|3.0|This was a fair version of the Super Hero not my favorite but the kids enjoyed it so it was worth the purchase
B000I0QK74|3.0|It must be hard for any great song writer to sell their soul and make a cute Christmas album, but I am sure it pays the bills. This is a cute Christmas album but was heavily promoted with very little opposition from other cute albums. Consequently, this one shot to the top of the best sellers when it really didn't deserve such an endorsement. You just can't beat the old classic albums by Nat King Cole and Perry Como when it comes to singing cute christmas songs. Carly should have warned James of that with her own effort!
B000IZJZLM|4.0|Lovely music very pleasant to listen to.  Not quite as good as first album. Don't let this discourage you from buying this album.  You will still get your monies worth.
B000JJRIN4|4.0|I liked the cd.  I haven't heard her first cd so i wouldn't have anything to compare it too.
0385337388|2.0|Waited until after residency and fellowship to read this book.  Amusing how many of the phrases have become part of the vernacular in medicine but, overall, the stories are painfully boring and redundant.  This book is mostly of historical interest only.  Wouldn't put it at the top of my \\"must read\\" list.
B000JIHP88|5.0|We bought this for my 3 month old son and he loves it.  There are many nights that he has fallen asleep by watching the peek a boo leaves open and close.  I think the level of volume is perfect.  After reading some of the other reviews, I was a little hesitant to order it, but remember- <br />It is not supposed to stimulate your baby!  It is to lul them to sleep!  I also like that you can remove the mobile part and leave the the base on just for the classical songs. <br />I would recommend this product-like I said I love it!
B000I5X81A|5.0|Takes me back to my first J.J. Cale album. He's still as smooth as ever. Put on the head phones, turn down the lights and enjoy.
B00005AQE8|5.0|What can i say? What can anyone say about this album. This project brought heat and fear to all the east coast rappers at the time of its release. Dont need to review this album anymore. Its tupac. The greatest rapper of our generation. All you old skool east coast riders, need to quit hating and admire the skills and memories he left with us.  <br /> <br />He was, and always will be the greatest MC ev.  <br /> <br />R.I.P. 2pac <br /> <br />All eyez on me!!!!
B000050XEI|5.0|This CD have a meaning to me, the song Only Time have a healing message for everyone. Is like having someone who is giving you an advice in trouble times. You have to get this CD!!!!!
B000JK8OYU|5.0|It was a gift for my brother and he loves it.  We both grew up with <br />the beatles.  It is so easy to buy items on Amazon than it is messing <br />around with the phone and on tv deals.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|The Illusionist and The Prestige were released in theatres in 2006 and featured 19th century magicians as their protagonists. However, the latter was backed and promoted by a major Hollywood studio while the former was a modestly budgeted independent film. As a result, The Illusionist probably didn't receive the kind of exposure it deserved. Both films also differed radically in tone. While, The Prestige focused on the rising competition between two magicians and the dangerous lengths they went to top one another, The Illusionist was a deeply romantic film about lovers separated by class.<br /><br />Edward Norton is well cast as the intensely charismatic magician. It's a wonderfully modulated performance that suggests a hint of arrogance (like when he makes Leopold look momentarily foolish during a performance) with a vulnerability that lies underneath and that Sophie's presence brings out.<br /><br />Paul Giamatti is also excellent as Uhl, the audience surrogate. He narrates the film and is also a conflicted character, torn between his loyalty to Leopold and his sympathy with Eisenheim. The battle of wits between him and Eisenheim are well-played. Both are intelligent men who are very careful and meticulous in how they deal with their professions.<br /><br />The stunning Jessica Biel looks luminous in each and every shot. She's mainly known for appearing in forgettable Hollywood fluff like Summer Catch and Stealth but recently she's been trying to branch out and pick more substantial projects like Elizabethtown and Home of the Brave.<br /><br />The story of The Illusionist is deceptively simple: a love story on the surface but this is actually a bit of misdirection on director Neil Burger's part as we must pay attention to every detail.  Nothing is what it seems as he orchestrates the entire film like one of Eisenheim's illusions.<br /><br />There is an audio commentary by writer/director Neil Burger. He talks about what drew him to the short story and why he wanted to make it into a movie. He also speaks intelligently about the film's themes and character motivations. This is an excellent and informative track that covers many aspects of the production.<br /><br />\\"The Making of The Illusionist\\" is a standard promotional featurette with the actors talking briefly about their characters and the story of the film with clips from the movie.<br /><br />\\"Jessica Biel on The Illusionist\\" features some of the soundbites from the previous featurette as she talks briefly about why she wanted to do this film.<br /><br />Finally, there is a theatrical trailer.hy he wanted to make it into a movie.

B000LWDCZ2|4.0|Carlos Gardel was a very popular tango singer during the late twenties and early thirties in Argentina.  Lost to Hispanics due to a tragic airplane accident at Medellin's (Colombia) airport, he became almost inmediately a myth of the Spanish cult of the dead; and is one of his famous songs Volver, turned into \\"rumba flamenca\\" and peformed by Penelope Cruz in one of the scenes of this sentimental movie, which gives to it the main title.    Full of references to the convention, and with characters taken maybe from reality or maybe from Latin television soap operas,[many references to TV programs are present and even a recreation of a popular and actual one in Spain] Volver is an ironic, humorous, and typical Almodovar's farce whose roots may go backwards to very old techniques of Spanish culture.
0140277447|5.0|An astonishing book that describes the holocaust in Nanking by the Japanese empire. This book not just points out the facts and events taken place in southern China, but also sheds light to many European heros' valiant reaction to the ruthless slaughtering and raping of chinese civilians.  <br />The holocaust of Nanking killed more people in the same period of time than any other wartime holocaust, including German's concentration camp. <br /> <br />This is a devastating book. Let this tragedy not be forgotten!!
B00006IX0R|5.0|It's the Cranberries. If you like them, you love them, and if you don't, you don't.  <br />It's a great CD, but how could it not be?
B000FTWB7G|5.0|This CD is what you would expect from Evanescence.  \\"Call Me When You're Sober\\" rocks as do several other tracks.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This movie was superbly done.  It touched upon all the major historical events.  The documentary section was extremely well done.  To see the soldiers and hear their stories, it really gives you a sense of going through the war with them.  On a personal note, it was quite special to find footage of my husband's grandfather, who was in the 101st Airborne Division.
0618680004|5.0|A very excellent book. It began me on my journey from theism to the realization there truly is no personal god. Very witty and well written, the book is a new favorite of mine.
B000G759LW|5.0|You get 2 CDs with this and there are good songs on both CDs.  Linda Perry is all over the 2nd CD and it's good stuff.  You can definitely tell Christina was heavily involved in this creation, in more ways than providing the amazing set of pipes.
0743454537|4.0|I read this novel as part of my research on PGD (preimplantation genetic diagnosis).  But surprisingly became really involved in the story and its characters.  I enjoyed Picoult's device of using the different characters to narrate the story and the conflicting points of view.  For the bioethics student I felt this novel helps to understand the ethical and moral positions in a more concrete way.  It is easy for ethicists to talk in abstract terms, but a novel such as this with rich and candid emotion helps to illustrate how real ethical dilemmas can be.  I genuinely enjoyed this book and recommend it for the casual reader and the ethicist alike.
B000002LFZ|5.0|Whether you are a Fleetwood Mac fan or not, this is a great collection of songs.  I have always been a radio fan of Fleetwood Mac and picked up one of their concert DVDs a few months ago.  I found Mac songs that I was familiar with but were never in my collectoion.  Now they are.  This is a great mix of Fleetwood Mac staples and if you only own one Fleetwood Mac CD, make it this one, well okay, yoy really need to own Rumours as well.  Listen to Rhianon, or Golddust Woman or any of Christine's songs and listen to the great sound that was Fleetwood Mac.  This is a must own album.  My only complaint it that it hasn't been remixed in 5.1.
B000I5X81K|5.0|I was impressed with the entire CD.  Josh Groban branches out into a few different realms of music and does a fantastic job!  I highly reccomend this CD for any Josh Groban fans!
0307346609|5.0|WWZ is a perfect book. The way it was written is genius. This is by far the best book I've read, and I am much looking forward to future titles by Max Brooks. This guy is a genius.
0694013889|3.0|This book is ok.  I wish I had just bought her the video.  The potty in the book looks different than ours and my daughter thinks the girl in the book is using a flower pot to go potty in. It's a cute book, but doesn't really help in the process of potty-training.
B00002ZMNV|5.0|Truly a great concert, one of the best I have ever 100, and Im not a hardcore metallica fan!!! Besides, didn't had any problems with the product or the shipping.
B000BI0WOA|5.0|I love, love, love this CD and have it on whenever I'm in the car!  So glad I found it and bought it.  I've always enjoyed Knopfler's more obscure tunes and this is full of 'em  It's one of those CD's that you can just put on and let it play.  If you love Dire Straits and/or Mark Knopfler, this has all the classics!
076790592X|4.0|My 16 year read this book and said it's great. If a kid can relate to the message - that's a good author.  Highly recommends it.  I'm next!
B0000214F0|3.0|I wanted to see what all the controversy was over the making of this film.  Caligula is an interesting movie and, what the filmmakers consider to be, a truthful account of life in Rome.  Some of the scenes seemed to be there for shock value only, but are not as shocking today as when the film was originally made, but still might shock some.  One of the scenes in particular, would still be considered shocking and vulgar because of it's mixture of violence and sex.    The movie drags on a bit, again in order to add scenes for shock value.  If you want to see what life was really like in Rome (perhaps), then this is an alternative depiction from what one normally sees on the History Channel.  This movie doesn't seriously offend (although it tries), nor does it seriously enthrall.
B000FS9FCQ|4.0|Great movie but not as great as the comic, I loved the bonus material
0062502182|4.0|I highly recommend this book. This author is great.. flows easily but with great life message. He does a great job at correlating decisions with positive or negative life results/experiences.
0099727404|5.0|Read this book as it has the ability to allow you to transform your life.

B000HBK3MM|5.0|I loved this CD.  Corinne Bailey Rae has a very soothing sound.
B00004U2G4|5.0|I read with amusement the other reviews comparing Beck to Page and insisting you must make an either/or choice between the two.  That is pure hogwash...it is both/and.    Although the Page contributions to this project are appreciated, Beck and Stewart are the rightful stars, and they pale to no one.    Beck's guitar work is far superior on Truth compared to anything in the Yardbirds era, and in my opinion any of his later work.  The sounds he makes with the rudimentary effects of that era are phenomenal, and sound like they could have been recorded yesterday.  When you hear this, you can hear the influence he had upon musicians like Trower, Vaughn and even his contemporary, Page.    This was the breakout for Stewart, and his raw, strained vocals add an edge to these blues that will make you bleed at times.  He never sounded better.    I wish that Beck/Stewart would have recorded more than two albums (see Beck-Ola).  But because they didn't, the mighty Zep was able to fill that void.
B00005OAIE|5.0|It's great. Every song does not sound the same. Good variety of sounds.
B00005V1B2|5.0|First and foremost anyone who likes progressive rock should own this album.  Camel are a progressive rock band like no other and this is there magnum opus.  The Snow Goose is an amazing album by an exetremely underated band.  All instrumental the album is based on the short story The Snow Goose by Paul Gallico.  The band run the full spectrum of emotions and styles.  I just got the album yesterday and I havent stopped listening to it yet.  Through out the record the melodic lines are superb and the musicianship tight and full of energy.  Do yourself a favor get THE SNOW GOOSE.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I love this series. I atually bought it for my boyfriend because he is such a WWII fan. I didnt think that i would be interested in anything like this but we watched the entire series in a week. I cried, I laughed, it was awesome!
B00005V1B1|5.0|This is a wonderful album by a band that has found and refined their sound.  After listening to the first two tracks alone one can tell that these guys have played live together a great deal.  The intricate twists and turns are absolutely Sweet.  Nimrodel and Lady fantasy are two of my favorite progressive rock songs (and I heard them for the first time yesterday).  One listen and you will immediatly want to purchase Moonmadness, Snow Goose, and A Live Record.
B000A59PMO|5.0|I got this for my daughter.  I am a middle aged woman who watches Veronica Mars and loves it.  I think Kristen Bell and the other cast members are new, fresh, and I love the mystery \\"who done it\\" of each season.  My daughter works a lot of hours and is unable to always catch the original, but I knew she would love it too.  She does and wants me to get season two so she can catch up.  That is next on the list!!  We love discussing the shows now!!
B000IJ79WU|4.0|Having not seen the \\"theatrical\\" cut of Superman II in years, I can't speak to how much better this picture is than that version--what I can say is that after the embarrassment of \\"Superman Returns,\\" Donner's cut of the original sequel was a welcome breath of fresh air.  In fact, it was so good, so enjoyable and so much fun that it actually helped to set the stage for \\"Superman Returns\\" a bit, and helped the later film on subsequent viewings.<br /><br />Still not crazy about turning back time, though, and as much fun as the second \\"diner\\" scene might be for viewers, it really seems un-Superman-like for him to go beat up on some guy just because he's a jerk.
B00005JNS0|5.0|I had never watched it before, and also the daycare children i watch enjoyed it also.
B000J10ERO|2.0|I was not a huge fan of Spider-Man or its sequel. Well, those films are looking like cinematic gems in hindsight....<br /><br />As a longtime Superman reader (like many people my age, I started in 1992 with the rumors of his \\"death\\" and carried on reading through Doomsday!, Funeral For a Friend, The Reign of the Supermen and a dozen other half-baked stories (remember when his skin turned blue and he had electric powers? When he split in half into \\"Superman Red and Superman Blue?\\" When Jimmy was attacked by a vampire and saved by a stage magician? I do!). But NONE of them included a...<br /><br />...well, these Amazon reviews have to be spoiler-free. Let's just say there's a \\"plot device\\" created about an hour and a half into this picture, that completely ruins the remaining hour for me. The first chunk of the film was fun, and reusing the imagery and music from the old films really captured the majesty that a Superman movie should have...but by the end, I was waiting for a Yellow Cosmic Fear Bug to pop out of the background someplace and complete the ridiculous picture.<br /><br />(For you non-comic people out there, the Yellow Cosmic Fear Bug is a reference to a particularly preposterous plot device used by current Superman and Action Comics co-plotter Geoff Johns to explain away the ten-year period during which Green Lantern became a maniacal and exceptionally powerful villain named Parallax. Turns out that yellow being the color of fear ISN'T totally random, but instead has some kind of historical basis in this cosmic, insectoid monster called The Parallax. It took the guy over--it completely wasn't his fault when he lost it and killed all his friends and supporting cast members!)<br /><br />Back to Superman--the first half or so of the film was terrific. It was cinematically a wonder--so many of the shots were terrific, the performances were pitch-perfect (except the irritating guy who played Jimmy Olsen--played him WAY geekier than needed). The DP on this film should get a medal. Same for the music folks, who made the important and emotionally-impactful decision to stick almost exclusively to the original John Williams score from 1978's Superman: The Movie or at least to pieces that evoked that score.<br /><br />But the focus on Superman as Savior (there's even a shot of him literally looking like he's being crucified) doesn't work at all in light of certain moral ambiguities introduced to Kal-El's character in this film--while Jor-El (Marlon Brando, from beyond the grave) extols the virtues of being a shining beacon, and an example by which mankind might grow better, his son has done some seriously questionable things leading up to this film, not the least of which is the very premise of the movie--that he left one day, never told anyone why, and never had a satisfactory answer throughout the picture for why he might have done it. The closest anyone comes is when Clark offers that maybe Superman had never said goodbye to Lois \\"because it would have been too painful for him.\\" This seems to be not to be a particularly worthy savior. Singer's example to all humanity cops out on one of the most important things he may ever do--saying a potentially final goodbye to the one person he loves more than anything--because he's worried about what? Crying a little bit? Running off to Krypton and staying there for years because he wanted to seems like an extraordinarily self-centered move, and this is reinforced when, immediately on his return to Earth, he watches a news report full of terrible things that it's implied he could have stopped, had he stayed.<br /><br />A profound disappointment, this one. Superman should be the apex superhero--the one whose light shines for all and who inspires everyone. Batman's there to scare us into behaving, Superman's there to inspire us into making ourselves better. This was the one theme of DC's recent Infinite Crisis story that never got skewered by editorial meddling.<br /><br />Until it hit theaters.ntil it hit theaters.
B000HWZ61Y|5.0|Def Leppard has really outdone themselves with the release of this awesome collection. I thought Hysteria couldn't be topped when it was initially released but this re-release takes the cake. I've been a fan for over 20 years and this CD collection does not dissappoint. It's an IN YOUR FACE reminder of why they are one of the best in the business and strong representation of the raw talent of Steve Clark (RIP). If you don't have this one, you need to get it quick! If you love Def Leppard, your collection shouldn't be without this one.
B00011F5DK|4.0|I ordered this game for my 8 yr. old granddaughter for Christmas and had to get one for me too!  We all love it and are addicted to it!  It's a fun easy game that changes constantly. From the youngest children to the old folks like me...our entire family loves it!
B000M2O6AQ|5.0|AFTER READING ALL THE CELESTINE PROPHECY BOOKS (4), WE WERE SO EXCITED TO ORDER THE MOVIE.  IT WAS ABSOLUTELY ENLIGHTENING AND WE LOVED IT.  I WILL SAY THAT WE WERE GLAD WE HAD READ THE BOOKS BEFORE THE MOVIE, AS IT MADE THE FLOW OF THE MOVIE EASIER TO FOLLOW.  CRYSTLE SALISBURY

B000HCO8IQ|5.0|The sisters have such a wonderful blend of styles pulling some of the best and most fun sounds from multiple decades.  At times I can picture 70s roller skating rinks and other hi -tech beats.  Have had the CD in my car player for months.
0307237699|5.0|I have just about completed this book. It is a wonderful insite into this man, who could very well be our President one day. He is honest, though very diplomatic in his observations and opinions about how our govenment is and should be run. <br /> <br />I enjoyed his family stories and how he came to be who he is. I recommend the book, if only to get a take on a man who will be very much in our future, one way or the other.

B000HBKCDC|5.0|I listened to this CD over and over again for weeks and absolutely love it.  My favorites are \\"River\\" and \\"Song for a Winter's Night\\", but there aren't any songs on the CD that I dislike.  Kudos to Sarah for doing a \\"nontraditional\\" holiday album!
0563362499|5.0|This is our 2nd copy of the book as the old one was getting worn and tired through overuse!<br /><br />If you're new to cooking we thoroughly recommend this book.

It's a 'must' for every cook!
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Even with the 30-minute update added to the DVD, major, critical results of recently published Earth and climate science are missing from the stunning picture drawn by An Inconvenient Truth. Recent discoveries regarding global dimming by our particulate pollution having offset about 65% of our warming, about the majority of ancient mass extinctions having been caused by volcanic warming events over long periods of time, and about the history of Antarctica's ice sheet -- which show that we could easily melt nearly all of it's ice by merely doubling atmospheric CO2, combine to paint a picture of unimaginably severe consequences from our seemingly modest average warming already seen. The problem is that the planet was not in an inherently stable condition, rather the Arctic and the sea floor contained elements which were set to produce massive, positive feedbacks in response to our initial push.  Start reading.  Start talking.  And leave fossil carbon fuels behind, or soon it will be too late to save the planet from such catastrophes as a 25 degree F average global temperature increase, an eventual 330-foot rise in sea level, and the end of the ozone layer from hydrogen sulphide gas released by a heated-up, anaerobic ocean. If you want there to be a future for civilization, or for creation as we know it, do your part to end the era of fossil fuels now.
B00005JOLI|4.0|This is a first episode and we are waiting for the second. Undeniably this is a first step on the road to fantasy and romance, but we don't know what public is really targeted, the less than 12, the 12 to 16 or the over 16. That makes the film prudish about the romantic side of things and the hero is not even allowed one farewell hug, not to speak of a kiss, with  the beutiful princess he has saved. At the same time the frightening moments when fear comes from the fast apparition of an enemy or a monster are quick and well timed hence effective, but too quick and maybe too frightening for the younger audience. The main shotcoming is that it is not centered on one field of interest, it is too multifarious. The dragon is good but another more realistic and down to earth animal might increase her, since it is a she, charm and valorize her appeal. Village life and town life are too skimpy and they deserve more precise and accurate depictions. The mountains are OK since they are necessary for the dragon, but yet it would be good to get more details about the citadels at the top of mountains. One vision from afar and entering it as if it were totally open is too easy. Can do better. In the same direction we do not get a real overview of the battle. It looks too messy to be significant. The monsters are also too skimpy. We would like to see them more and be able to penetrate their nature and monstrosity. What's more a little more sentimental content and affection if not passion would be good. Only men seems to hug and women are really out of reach. I have nothing against two boys embracing before getting separated for life, far from it in fact, but it would look more normal if Eragon could hug his princess, and if more occasion to do so among the various characters could be present. This is a first episode of what has to be at least a trilogy. Good for a first attempt. But you have to do better for the next volume to find an audience and also enter a real legend. And please make the clothing of poor people look poor. Eragon was definitely too well dressed before the arriving in the rebel camp for what and who he was. Did he go to Harrod's, or something ? And definitely overdressed. A little bit of skin does not hurt at all, you know.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonnee make the clothing of poor people look poor.

B0007Y08IS|2.0|Haven't seen too many marionette films, so this was a newish format. I seem to remember something similar on British tv, quite a long time ago, for kids. If you're in the right mood you might find it fairly funny. However, come to think of it, I didn't laugh once. Like the Amazon man says, don't expect anything subtle. Although the politics may be different, this seemed to me to be in the vein of Blazing Saddles, which I found to be a seriously unfunny film. There's something about this style of American humour, which kills them over there, but which travels extremely badly to other parts of the globe; and I can't really recommend it to anyone outside the good ol' USA.
B000K4WPCC|4.0|Although I'm intrigued by psychological thrillers/horror films featuring serial killers (Silence of the Lambs, the Saw movies, etc.), I'm not usually a fan of horror. I'm not sure what possessed me to rent the movie--I think because it had gotten 4 stars on Netflix and because it was based on a comic book--but I did.<br /><br />I have to tell you, I was VERY entertained by this movie. Had I watched this as a teen girl, I think I would have had a stroke when watching Steven Strait and some of those hot bodies onscreen. Yikes!<br /><br />The cinematography and settings were gorgeous. I live in the Northeast and our gorgeous autumns were captured fantastically. The sound track was quite good, which surprised me, as was the acting. I don't care if the main \\"Son of Ipswitch\\" was a former model or not--he is an INCREDIBLE actor!<br /><br />I was glued to the screen and, personally, loved the \\"water bubble\\" fights. My husband mentioned that he'd like to see more varied special effects--like the thread-like light tentacles--but I was perfectly happy seeing the energy balls. Personally, I don't like blood and gore (which is why I don't normally go for blatant slashers or cruelty), so I got to see some great fights without the blood!<br /><br />I'm glad they used mostly unknown actors (although my husband tells me that the mother was in the Santa Clause movies...); it made the plot more believable, in my opinion. (Well, believable for a sci-fi type movie...)<br /><br />One thing I don't understand, though: the mother says to the son that \\"ascending makes you 1,000 more powerful\\", yet, he was no match for the other kid until his Dad willed his power to him? I mean, I know willing power makes you strong, but if ascending was truly 1,000 powerful, wouldn't he have kicked stronger butt even BEFORE his Dad willed him his portion?<br /><br />Anyway, if you're looking for an escapist movie, this is a great film for forgetting the troubles of the day. Doesn't hurt that the guys are great eye candy, either...he guys are great eye candy, either...
B000HT3Q3M|4.0|Both Al Jarreau and George Benson fans will enjoy this cross-point of views from the 2 artists. A very good synthesis of these last 30 year's jazz/fusion music.

B000FIMG68|5.0|If you are a even SLIGHT fan of LOST, I recommend you buy this. It is a FANTASTIC price on Amazon, a lot less than what I have seen in stores. <br /> <br />The Second Season is just as good as the first season, if not better, and at such a great price this is a must buy. <br /> <br />If you have never seen LOST before, I would definitely recommend Season One, and once you're done, Season Two. You won't be disappointed. <br /> <br />I find myself watching episodes over and over again everyday, LOST is that addictive. <br /> <br />So buy, it's a fantastic price and worth every penny! <br /> <br />
B000065BPB|5.0|These headphones are very comfortable and provide a truly linear sound quality. After mixing tracks through powered studio monitors, the HD-280's deliver almost the same highs and lows as heard through the monitors.  I'd recommend them for anyone doing home studio work who doesn't want to fork over $100's of dollars for a set of headphones.
0307346609|4.0|I must admit, I'm a fan of the zombie genre.  So when I saw the title of this book I thought to myself, \\"cool, a book about a zombie apocalypse\\".  As I read, however, I started to realize that this was about a series of interviews from people who survived a zombie apocalypse.  Where were all the gut munching zombies?  Why was I reading about the human condition?  About human spirit and the will to survive?  I wanted my zombies, not implications of big corporate greed.  I wanted total Remeoresque carnage, not an interview of a bodyguard who told of how a Hollywood producer  and his \\"close\\" friends got slauthered not by zombies, but by themselves.  I started reading in the a.m. on a Saturday, and finished 0230 Sunday morning.  Then I had a new realization; all the great zombie stories, albeit movies, books, comics, were really not about zombies at all, they were about us.  About the human condition, the human spirit, the will to survive.  Though a little sketchy at times, this book definetly got it right, and I'm looking forward to ripping and biting into what Max Brooks has next.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|I don't watch movies over and over, unless it's the shawshank redemption.  Fabulous character development, great story.

B000FVRACK|5.0|I am not a classical music aficionado, but I do love classical music, particularly piano.  This DVD is simply amazing.  To think that Rubinstein was 88 years old when he recorded this.  It's an incredible feat of musicianship as well as physical stamina.  To my amateur ear, I was blown away at the beauty of this performance.  This is not just a curiosity, this is a concert that is worthy of a great master like Rubinstein.  The quality of the sound and the picture is also fantastic.  I loved this DVD, if you like Rubinstein and classical music, I can't imagine you wouldn't feel the same.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|This is just the right item for anyone interested in learning what McNamara's intentions and personal drives were as he counseled Presidents Kennedy and Johnson regarding the Viet Nam war. He comes a hairs breadth from actually apologizing. Perhaps he will apologize before he passes away from us entirely, but we get the sense that to do so would destroy him. Clearly his acts have eaten away at the man.

B000063V8R|4.0|I grew up watching Star Trek TNG.  Now as an adult, I really enjoy seeing these episodes again.  The DVDs are great because you can watch as many as you want with no commercials.  It's fun to see the \\"special effects\\" from that decade compared to what we have these days. <br />The DVD menus are easy to use with 4 episodes per disc.  They are shown in order of air date, but the episodes are not always numbered in order. (Example: On the first disc, the first episode is 150, the second episode is 149) There are some special features on an additional disc, like behind the scenes production featurettes and interviews with the cast and crew.  The last episode of the season is a Part One, which means I'll be getting the 4th season soon... <br />My only complaint is with the packaging.  Maybe someday they will come up with a way to package 7 discs without making it 2+ inches thick. I have a hard time fitting it on my DVD tower.  The first 3 seasons take up more than 6 inches.

B000H7JCG4|4.0|I was a huge fan of Beverly Hills 90210 back in the day when I was going through my own teenage angst.  I so looked forward to reviewing these episodes but was slightly disappointed with the music.  They have changed much of the music and some of the episodes are missing key moments, as well it seems they've been rearranged. <br /> <br />However, with this seemingly negative criticism out of the way, I thoroughly enjoyed reminiscing about my teenage years by way of reliving the whole 90210 experience.  I must say that when I was younger I fantastically lived some of my life vicariously through Brenda, Brandon, Dylan, Kelly, Donna and David. <br /> <br />Overall, a good buy for a \\"Beverly Hills 90210\\" alumna like myself.  I watched all episodes within two days! <br /> <br />Now is the [hopefully not long] wait for Season Two!

B000BTGY1O|5.0|Enjoyed watching with my girlfriend who is now my fiance. This fun and colorful film with a few crazy characters can make a person laugh and cry. It is the film that prompted my girlfriend and I to choose her engagement ring and our wedding bands from Tiffany's.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|Even if you do not believe that global warming is here, you need to see this video. Politics aside, the ideas presented will make you think. This is an issue we all need to be very concerned with. It will change everything. We need to change as well.
0140042520|3.0|jack kerouac came recommended by several presumably legitimate sources however, after reading the dharma bums i may have to think twice the next time these people offer up others.  while i myself am an avid hiker and can relate to the sections in this book dealing with such senarios the book as a whole seemed to drag.  there were some scenes which had much potential to be captivating such as when a friend's girlfriend committs suicide, but kerouac fails to really emphasize.  overall i rate this book 3 stars because of the subject/genre of book that it is but i have read much better authors.  not impressed.
1598560573|5.0|I read this book for my honors class as an alternative option for those of us who had already read Mere Christianity.  Chesterton is an entertaining as well as insightful reader.  I don't agree with all of his ideas but his examples for how he reached his conclusions are fun and fairly logical from his point of view.  I strongly reccomend this book to anyone exploring the ideas of Christianity from within a Christian background.

B000J4QWM2|5.0|Great story, they stayed true to the first season of show but gave it a real modern-day flare. I love how they get tied in with the people they are undercover to bust and start to wonder if they're the good guys or the bad guys. I love how it's not some mindless action movie, but instead gives depth through its diverse locations and interesting characters.

B000G8NXZK|5.0|After I first watched Brazil about a year ago,...I was rather confused. The plot seemed like it was supposed to make sense yet I couldn't get my head around a few points in the film and their meaning. Several discussions later I got it and the 2nd and 3rd viewings have only brought more elements of the film to light. This interesting presentation by Terry Gilliam based somewhat on 1984 is often considered to be one of the top 100 films in the 20th century. <br /> <br />Regardless of the films merit, this particular collection is well worth the wait and the extra cash. The video quality is far superior to the original Criterion release while the rest remains relatively unchanged. All the extras, while very interesting, are the same except that the essay on the film is this time included on the extras disk instead of as a pamphlet like in the original release. The slip cover also has a different piece of artwork but neither are far superior to the other in my mind. <br /> <br />If you don't already own the first edition of the Criterion release, this is a good edition and generally cheaper than the original release. If you do, Criterion also sells disk 1, the feature film, by itself. Giving you the option of upgrading to the cleaned video and true wide screen without re-buying the set.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Although the Beatles understandably haven't released any new material in decades, \\"Love\\" finds a way to repackage classic Beatles music for a new generation.  \\"Love\\" flows from song to song, enabling the listener to appreciate the musical synergy, and wide range of music that the Beatles had in their catalog.  It features somewhat new interpretations of songs, without straying far enough away to upset the die-hard fans.<br /><br />Whether you are a long time Beatles fan or twenty-something interested in what all the fuss was about from your parents, \\"Love\\" is an essential part to any rock fan's collection.

0618680004|4.0|The book in the begioning was very good and made some good points. However the end was rather weak. It seemed to me Dawkins looked at religion as having no saving graces what so ever.

1582701709|5.0|I have read a universe of various volumes in this lifetime...beginning at age six with the complete works of Edgar Rice Burroughs, all of O.Henry's stories by the time I was nine, the Old and New Testaments several times before I was fifteen.  Then in my early thirties I began reading astrology, metaphysics, eastern mysticism, stories of Tibetan Monks (Lobsang Rampa and Rebazar Tarz), and too many others to list here.  The point is that there are hints, suggestions, and clues about being the \\"the Captain of My Soul, the Master of my Destiny....\\" in almost all extant forms of literature, from simplistic to esoteric. But, beware.  If you are not ready to accept responsibility for creating your own reality, every moment.......don't read this book.
B000ICL3KG|2.0|M.I.T.'s Professor Richard Lindzen (Professor for Meteorology and Atmospheric Science) has already refuted at least part of Gore's work, for instance, in the Wall Street Journal. In a nutshell, Lindzen states that no one really knows enough about the global climate to really say what definitively will happen. Gore, the non-scientist, claims to know (sound familiar ?). Lindzen, the man who studies this subject at one of the best universities in the world, claims to not know enough. So I ask you, is Gore's position science, or dogma (or self-promotion, or something else) ? Of course, Gore and the global warming alarmists have gotten really, really mad at people like Lindzen who stand in their way with odd, \\"petty\\" scientific data. They said that Lindzen is  in the pocket of \\"Big Oil\\". That is how they treat anyone who stands in the way of their message. Gore claims that global warming could result in Manhattan sinking under the ocean. And yet, scientists have refuted that claim. Would it be so tragic if Minneapolis or Novosibirsk (or Boston, for that matter) were 3 degrees warmer in winter ? The claim that the Atlantic pump could reverse has also been refuted and disproven. They don't take into account the fact that the sun changes its temperature, and that that affects the earth.  <br /> <br />I give credit to Gore for making us aware of the environment. I consider myself an environmentalist. But if parts of Gore's \\"evidence\\" has been refuted, why should I not doubt the other parts ?
0618477977|5.0|I have been buying the Polar Express gift set for many years to give to my daycare children.  This was the one book that my son loved as a child, so it is now my custom to give it to all my daycare children for Christmas in their first year at my home.
032147404X|5.0|This book is great!  It is plainly written and easily understood.  I enjoyed reading it and picked up quite a few pointers to benefit my skills in photography.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|This was the first movie I ordered.  I have watched this movie for many, many, many years, so I thought I might as well buy it.  The price was a little high I thought.  But when you like and want something, one will pay the price.
B000028U0Y|4.0|i've only recently become interested in johnny cash's music and this was my first album. the live recording does a great job of filling in the lines on who johnny cash was in addition to a good sample of his music. i am enjoying getting to know cash. <br /> <br />good purchase.
B000DN5W4I|5.0|This is a terrific concert. These are exceptional musicians and I am so thoroughly impressed with their live performance. My father was a huge fan of accomplished guitarists and was very eager to share Joe Bonamassa's music with me. Am I ever so glad he did! While looking for more of his music to buy, I saw an excellent review of this concert DVD and ordered it. I, in turn, have shown it to several people; all have agreed that this is quite incredible work.
0743289412|5.0|I really liked this book - very much.  It was obvious to me that King is married to a not-as-well-known, nor popular, writer, Tabitha.  The insights Kings wrote regarding what a Mrs. Stephen King (or Mrs. other popular celebrity) would feel were quite understandable, respectful and moving.  King writes from his own personal history, I am sure.  While I would classify this as an unusual love story, it is still classic Stephen King, with memorable characters, absorbing believable dialog, and some freaky nightmarish aspects thrown into the mix.  I would now like to read more of Lisey's Story - Lisey Lives On, as it were.  Great storytelling.  Excellent work, Stephen!
B000H6SXMY|5.0|Absolutely awesome.  We have had a non-stop marathon of friends.  We bought it for our daughter but the whole family has not stopped watching the cds.  The back to back episodes are fantastic.  We might have to get our own set when she goes back to college.  Or maybe we can hide them on her!!!
0345440900|4.0|This book is good with lots of great information, ideas and helpful advice. I would recommend reading in preperation for your bundle of joy! We bought it when my little boy was 8 months searching for some much needed sleep help, but this book wasn't a right fit for that. However, I wish I would have read the book much sooner b/c with Tracy's help and EASY daily structure I probably wouldn't have had the sleep mess on my hands that I did! So, I would recommend it, but I would recommend it EARLY. I will certainly reread it during my pregnancy with Baby #2.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|After many years and many requests,it's finally available!A rousingly patriotic if not historically exact(who cares,right?) movie about a true American hero as portrayed by an American acting icon,Gary Cooper.Dramatic and inspiring.
B000GPIPT2|4.0|This movie is one of the great classics and I had to have it.  Even better were all the extras that were included.  I found it totally intersting to see how the \\"big\\" movie studios worked back then, and being a 'Monster' fan since I was a child, it was great to see all of my favorites together in one place and hear how popular they were and how they were made.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|If you have not done it yet, go see the Beatles' Love Show at the Mirage in Las Vegas. This Cirque du Soleil show is where all the selections in the CD were used. Doing it this way, one can truly appreciate the special concoction of Beatle music that Sir George and Gile Martin came up with.   <br /> <br />Beatle classics combined with superb Cirque performance - a must see! <br /> <br />The producers should come up with a DVD version of the show plus surround music.  That would be a fantastic souvenir to own.
B0001I55NS|3.0|\\"Its not like the book!  It's not like the book!\\"  Okay, Michael Creighton fans can stop crying, the film is not as accurate as it could be - but after all, when has there ever been a novel-based film that followed the book to everyone's liking? <br /> <br />Anyway, its an energized film with great effects and a cool plot.  Paul Walker's performance is predictable (lots of \\"Woah\\"'s and \\"Bro\\"'s) but, overall, convincing.  This film is definitely worth having for the price.  Gerard Butler plays a good Merrick, and there are lots of other actors that no one knows the names of but have seen everywhere (\\"Hey, isn't that the guy from...\\") <br /> <br />Overall, good effects, good story, and descent performances.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This film is excellent. It gathers together the latest scientific evidence in one film about the problem of Global Warming and presents it in a very interesting, and entertaining way. It also provides the audience the way in which each of us can contribute to solving this problem.
B000JK8OYU|4.0|I liked this CD so much I went back and bought another for a friend. If you like the Beatles' music (and who doesn't, really?), and have always been curious about what modern technology could do to it, buy Love. Some people may think you shouldn't mess with a classic, but I say why not experience it both ways. I'll ride on the back of a horse, but I also drive a car.
B000002J1Y|5.0|I remember putting this album on and listening with headphones while looking at Roger Deans amazing album art...ah the 70's... <br />It is a blast to listen to on long road trips - so very raw and upbeat. Yes live has an amazing sound, and when this was recorded the equipment was massive and primitive by todays standards. I do miss the fullsize artwork, but since I still have my vinyl copy it's no loss. It is a great introduction to Yes and always inspiring to the Yes enthusiast (who probably already has it!). Get one for a friend...
B000DWMYQ8|4.0|We originally read poor reviews about this movie, so we did not watch it in theaters, but decided to wait until the video came out, if we would watch it at all.  We then started hearing positive word of mouth around town that was basically \\"it's not that bad.\\"  I also noticed that the video shelves were emptying fast once it was released---that was a poitive sign.  Since we are always on the lookout for a good and safe family movie we bit the bullet and decided to rent it.  I am so glad we did!  What a pleasant surprise this movie was.  It immediately became the first movie on my children's Christmas wish list (ages 2, 4, 7 and 9).  It is not a perfect movie (there are few that are), but even my wife and I laughed out loud several times and even got a little teary-eyed.  Put your bias aside and enjoy \\"Chicken Little\\" tonight!
B000HT386M|5.0|Loved the entire mixture of artist mixing their music with latin flavour. I totally recommend this CD to all. Easy listening any time of the day and mood.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|I thought I had bought every obscure Beatle album besides the original USA, UK and Japanese issues until this came out. Awesome remixes you won't believe from Giles and George Martin. A real surprise and a delight to listen to. Don't pass this up a must for any Beatle nut!
B0007Y08IS|5.0|I love this type of humor. It may not be for everyone, but it's so over the top, the type I enjoy. If you like Saturday Night Live or South Park, it's in the same category. You have to have a special sense of humor.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|If you love Chili Peppers you will love Stadium Arcadium. This is one of the best, it is sonic perfection. You could hear a mouse fart in the mix, it is that clean and clear. Totally Awesome !!
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Anyone with an interest in the horror and/or sci-fi genres will likely enjoy this show immensely. The Winchester brothers are written so believably, and the acting of Ackles and Padalecki completely sells it. The brothers travel the country in their '67 Impala hunting down things that go bump in the night and searching for the demon that killed their mother 22 years ago; all the while trying to locate their father (played by the amazing and gorgeous Jeffrey Dean Morgan). Good quality location shots for the most part, and the show does an excellent job with a small budget.
B000I5X81A|5.0|What can you say!!  E.C. with JJ Cale!  Eric Clapton gets to fulfill a dream of having an album produced and authored by JJ Cale.  E.C. has always done JJ's songs well, but never quite captured JJ's production style or feel.  On this album the two collaborate to provide you with some of the best music the two have ever done.  A must have for all!
0767903374|5.0|I bought The Highly Sensitive Person a few years ago and felt that someone understood me for the first time. When a workbook to accompany the original was released I couldn't wait to buy it. I was not disappointed. It can be used as a stand alone text but I have been rereading the original and doing the exercises in the workbook at the same time. Elaine Aron is sensitive to us HSPs. Her workbook is not at all overwhelming and can be done at your own pace and as in depth as you want to go. I thank Elaine for standing up for those of us that while at times may be in the shadows are certainly not invisible. We are capable, strong, caring individuals and Elaine Aron, being one herself, is very in tune with the world as it affects us. <br />I recommend purchasing both the original text and the workbook.
0793518326|4.0|This book is very good stuff. There, you can find almost every song written and recorded by the beatles in full score. Unfortunately, some songs from the Anthology albums are missing (e.g. Free as a Bird).
0385751060|1.0|The idea of this book is an interesting approach to the Holocaust, but I wasn't impressed.  The ending has some shock value, trying to import the horror of the Holocaust, but it felt more like a gimmick to impress the reader with how \\"deep\\" this book is, rather than being a thought-provoking event.  Comparing this to \\"The Diary of Ann Frank\\" is very misleading.
B000F8O35U|5.0|This is a great DVD, bonus disc had a lot of features, the inside story was especially informative.  It also has a cool musice video by Ashley Tisdale for \\" kiss the girl \\" which my daughter loved.  Story line is classic. <br />Very well worth the purchase.  Only con to this is the amount of merchandise associated with the release of this DVD that cost me lots of money, since my little girl loved the movie so much I had to get her all the stuff for it, toys, books, music cd, a toddler bed even, lol. Well, it's memories that will last forever.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|We saw the \\"LOVE\\" show in Las Vegas first. (I highly recommend it) <br />The album is every bit as good (maybe better)!
0739308742|2.0|Way too long winded, too many characters, couldn't keep up.  For History buffs they might enjoy.
B000H5U832|5.0|I accidentally ordered the wrong item to begin with and was able to cancel it and reorder the exact item that we wanted.  The price was great, the service was great, and it arrived before I expected it.  I will use Amazon.com in the future!
B000HT3P7E|5.0|I started this show from the beginning.  I didn't expect much but I was pleasantly surprised.  It is one of the funniest shows on televison at present - the only real competition are the NBC comedies. <br /> <br />The cast is first rate and the writing is snappy and witty.  The Barneyisms are every bit as quotable as Homer Simpson or Peter Griffith. <br /> <br />This set also includes amusing and insightful commentaries and a great blooper reel. <br /> <br />While this is not quite to the comedic level of \\"Scrubs\\", it's well on it's way.
B00005MP58|5.0|I cannot say enough about the excellence of this DVD.  The story was thrilling, the actors perfectly matched with the characters of the book. <br />The performance, action, movement of the story are all excellent.  This is a classic that everyone should see.  Do not even compare the excellence of this film with some shorter versions that are on the market. This one with these actors are a real gem.  One caution - it is a long film but worth every minute of it.
B000JJRIP2|5.0|My husband loved this box set!  He said it was one of the best Christmas present he got this year.
B000H5U832|4.0|This movie would have gotten 5+ Stars from me except that they say HELL in it TWICE.  It's not real plain but I turned on my caption to confirm. Other than that it is a very cute movie and my daughter loves it.
B000I0QK74|5.0|I was able to purchase the CD easily, and the shipping was very fast(Faster than indicated).The item arrived in pristine condition.Thanks for a positive shopping experience.  Sincerely,  ED
0783231032|1.0|I didn't enjoy this movie.  It hit me as being rather stupid.  I didn't even watch the whole movie because I got bored with it.
B00005MP58|5.0|I've read Jane Austen's book and seen more than one version on the screen. The A&E production is far and away the best. I have an old taped version that we cobbled together from the tv mini-series. What a pleasure to have the whole thing on dvd. It is so rare for the entertainment industry to have the integrity to reproduce an author's work so faithfully. This production is the exception. As I said, simply the best!
B000F8O35U|5.0|Every little girls fantasy. To live in the sea and also fall in love with a prince. Excellent DVD
1881273989|3.0|I liked this one! He makes sense and the information is practical. A good read for someone who is looking to connect with a significant other.
1400079276|4.0|This book should probably be read twice so as not to miss all the philosophical allegories hidden in it.  As a woman I did not always enjoy the male pre-pubescent sexual scenes, but on the whole this book was amazing.  As I mentioned above, I think I need to read it again to get the full meaning out of it.  I enjoyed the fact that it was written a Japanese man with a life perspective so different from my western view.
0307237699|5.0|Barack Obama's book is not only inspiring, but fullfilling as well. It is obvious why Senator Obama's name is on everyone's lips. It has been awhile since our government had some refreshing new and creative ideas. I believe this man will become the first African American President, but moreso, a President with all the qualities we may have forgotten in a leader. The book is a must read for anyone wanting good answers to perplexing challenges that face us. Don't \\"think\\" about buying this book..\\"\\"BUY IT\\"\\"\\"\\"
B00005JNS0|5.0|This movie is one of the best animation movies I have seen in a long time. For once my grandkids can watch a movie over and over and I never get tired of it!
B000JK8OYU|5.0|This is not the Beatle Anthology, but arguably better. It is not new material, but old placed in the hands of the master himself. Listening to songs with bits and pieces previously undetectable to most of us is pure pleasure. Listening to Beatle tunes remixed and edited is just what the music doctor ordered. Hey George, any possibility that you'll do some more? Please!
0895292211|5.0|The Secret of all life is clearly shown to us in this book.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|If you like SciFi and westerns, this series is for you.  I normally don't watch regular TV but this is worth watching.
0446528056|5.0|A wonderfully written romance, brings tears to your eyes, as all of Nicholas Sparks books, (and I have them all), they are a treasure to read.
B000F7CMRM|4.0|Be prepared to watch this without distractions. Great movie but you need to dedicate the time to enjoy it because it could get confusing.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This is a eye opener.  If we don't have the planet what do we have? This is a great movie to see regardless of your political preference.
0307346609|3.0|Its not the easiest flowing book I've ever read but if you like zombie flicks and books, give it a try.
B000E41MS6|5.0|I have enjoyed Doctor Who ever since I saw Tom Baker in the lighthouse in The Horror of Fang Rock. He was without a doubt the NUMBER ONE Doctor. This series estabishes Christopher Eccleston as an arguably strong number three. He would be a solid number four if there was no Rose. Every penny I spent on this DVD set was money well spent.  My kids and grandkids love to watch this Doctor Who. My grandkids prefer \\"the curly-headed guy\\" (Tom Baker)also, but like the convenience of watching the DVDs and hearing the commentaries in this set.  I recommend this set highly.
B000HCO83Q|3.0|It was only so-so.  They had a great idea but failed to deliver a great movie.  The series has been going downhill.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|I have been waiting a very long while for Loreena McKennitt to record another CD.  She certainly doesn't disappoint with this one and it was worth the wait.  Her mastery of complicated vocals and various, often obscure instruments, is truly womderful.  Enya, Listen Up!   <br />Listening to this music will take you far, far away to a world that many of us really wish existed.   Let's hope we don't have to wait another few years to have her next CD released!  I fear that she is an often overlooked talent and this is a real shame. <br />Sue <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0156012197|5.0|A great read for any age!  The Little Prince has many life lessons.
0740748475|4.0|Love Calvin and Hobbes.  The books are beautiful, but very heavy.  They look really nice on our shelves.
0790731509|5.0|bought this movie for my boyfriend for christmas and you should've seen his face when he opened it!!
B000AYQJ3I|5.0|I have seen so many shows at the Garden, to not see this one, well you know...! \\"My Sweet Lord\\" what a show!!! Thank you, Thank you, very much!!
B000I2IT44|5.0|Only performance video made by PT so far. If you're a fan of PT, you probably already have this, if not, get it. If you're new to 'em this is an excellent video introduction to the world's best progrock! The whole package is a real joy and definitely worth the price of admission.
B0007M22TI|5.0|I love this performance!  When I saw this on TV, I was hooked on Celtic Woman's music; now, I buy their individual CDs and will buy the next DVD.  Everyone should experience music from these FANTASTIC women!
B000FVGMC4|5.0|Since receiving this CD I've enjoyed the entire album over and over.  Paulo is a great songwriter with a unique voice.  Love it!
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I saw the performance on TV, now, I can listen to it all the time!  Beautiful music, a wonderful gift for anyone!
B000H5U832|5.0|This movie can be watched by all. Have watched it a few times now and laugh every time.
0920668372|5.0|This book is so sweet.  Every parent should have this book in their home! Every child should have the reassurance from their parents as is in this book.
B000002GZ1|5.0|THIS RECORD HAVE GREAT SONGS WITH FEELING  AND INTENSITY BUT THE SOUND COUD BE BETTER, PAUL BUTTERFIELD ITS A GREAT HARMONIC PLAYER AND IN THIS DISC BRINGS GREAT PERFORMANCES AND MIKE BLOOMFIELD IT`S GREAT TOO. IF YOU LIKE THE BLUES AND YOU`RE STARTING A COLLECTION YOU SHOULD BUY IT.
0142004413|5.0|A great starter to Durrell, easily his best !! <br />Like Durrell, I too can never forgive Kralefsky ;-)) <br />Highly recommended for all ages!! Read this before you start with Birds,Beasts & Relatives.
B00005R8GU|5.0|ALL BLUES LOVERS MUST HAVE THIS ONE, MUDDY AT BEST WITH PAUL BUTTERFIELD, MIKE BLOOMFIELD, BRINGS GREAT PERFORMANCES WITH EXCELLENT QUALITY SOUND. GREAT MUDDY CLASSICS. GET IT AND ENJOY THE RIDE!!!
B000I0QK74|5.0|Hearing a voice from my high school and college days sing Christmas songs from my childhood made my Christmas bright. I saw him in concert in late November and promptly went out and bought to buy this cd, only to find it was sold out in every store I visited!  Thanks to Amazon, I found it and ordered three copies: one for me and two to share with friends.  I may listen to it all year!
B000JBXXZ4|5.0|Whenever a new Incubus album has came out, I've always made sure to get it on the first day, regardless of anything I might have heard. After first getting hooked on S.C.I.E.N.C.E., and then with subsequent releases of great albums(Morning View didn't have AS many songs that I loved, though) capped in November by Light Grenades, they've managed to always stay at the top of my playlist. <br /> <br />Light Grenades is  a bit of a different sound than previous efforts, as always, but it does not disappoint. It certainly starts off stronger than it finishes with tracks like \\"Kiss to Send Us Off\\", \\"Dig\\", and the great first single \\"Anna Molly\\", but falters slightly towards the end(I still haven't gotten into the \\"Earth to Bella\\" songs, but Boyd uses his voice well in each). <br /> <br />I've listened to the album several times through since I bought it, and so far I don't see that stopping. The lyrics are fantastic, if a little campy at times(Looking at you \\"Love Hurts\\"), and the musical talents of Boyd and crew are as good as ever. Definitely a good buy for any Incubus fan. <br /> <br />
B000H0MKGK|4.0|I enjoy the CD very much.  I also enjoyed the ease of buying it on Amazon
B0000549B0|5.0|I've just watched this movie and all I can say is... wow. This is the kind of movie which makes you want to rush out and discuss it with somebody. With warmth and humor, it raises serious questions: What does it mean to be normal? How important is it to be normal, and indeed, why should people even want to be normal? Highly recommended for all psychology students!  <br /> <br />Aside from the wonderful concept, this movie also features great dialogue and brilliant acting from all leads, especially Jimmy Stewart and, of course, Harvey.
B000CNFC76|5.0|Great entertainment, What ever you do don't miss it ! ! ! ! ! !
B000002LRX|5.0|And I'm astounded at the brilliance of this album.  I've recently found out FNM is often times copied in lots of bands i like.   I mean not to name any names, but I really thought when I saw \\"Digging the Grave\\" (from the next album) that it was a band that totally sounded like a certain Armenian band that's really popular.  I actually only started listening to FNM/Patton stuff because he did an EP with the Dillinger Escape Plan (who's also very talented).  I think I'll be getting the UK version w/Easy.
B000GIXEIG|4.0|I have seen other versions of this story and this is the best by far.  I am a huge Gerry Butler fan, but this is a story that was told with such ternderness compared to other versions and the scenery is breathtaking.  Not at all gorey or gross which is amazing for this story.
B0006L16N8|1.0|I would never tell anyone to buy this.If you like real metal this is not for you.
B0001I55OC|5.0|I loved the story in this movie.  It was different, fresh and really well done.  Lots of action for guys, but still romantic without being too mushy.  No blood and guts so my kids could even watch it.  I'm glad that I've purchased this one.
032147404X|4.0|Great book packed with useful information. Although Scott Kelby is often described as a \\"want-a-be comedian\\" or having a \\"silly\\" writing style, I find his books easy to read and very informative.
B000I5X81K|5.0|I wish I could give this more than 5 stars!  I haven't stopped listening to this CD since I purchased it.  I don't even care that I don't understand Italian because the music is so beautiful that it doesn't matter what he's singing about.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|I don't usually like easy listening music, but I loved the first Corinne Bailey Rae song I heard.  I bought the CD and listened to it every day for 2 weeks.  It is a great CD with a variety of songs.  I think she has a lot of potential and we should definitely keep an eye out for her next CD.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|Amazon always has given me great service. I received the item in a very timely manner. I looked for a long time for this movie. It's fantastic.
B000I5X81K|4.0|This cd is really good.  I like the more contemporary songs he sings.  The best songs, I think, are Don't Give Up, which I love because of the emotion he gives to the song, and In Her Eyes.  The only song I don't really care for is the last one, Machine.
0689853637|5.0|Grandson adores this book... and I bought another about dinosaurs ... made points in his house...
B000J103X4|5.0|Another great album, better than the Documentary. <br /> <br />The Games number one after 2pac and right beside Lil Wayne. <br /> <br />
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Me and my boyfriend love this show!!! It's very addicting, and attention grabbing, best tv show i've seen in awhile. They fight demons as well as their personal demons.
0743289412|5.0|Lisey's Story is a well written story. <br />The charecters all come to life as typical in any Stephen King book. <br />The story starts out with Lisey cleaning out her deceased husbands manuscripts. Even though her writer husband Scott is dead you get to know their relationship. He has left her clues as to what to do. <br />This book is a real page turner, you'll have a hard time putting it down until the very last page. <br />Suspensful, very good plot, and you'll be cheering for Linsey. <br />Brillant work in fantasy as well. <br />I love Stephen Kings writting because he has no boundries. <br />Another great book to add to the many that he has done! <br /> <br />
B000I0RNVG|5.0|All the hype related to this film are deserved classic film. Especially notewworthy not just for the directors cut but the inclusion of the soundtrack by Ennio Morricone.  The extras are sort of unnecssary, like poster cards and recipes but the box is a nice addition to any bookshelf.
B00005JO9J|5.0|If you haven't seen all of season one - you have to get this DVD to know all of the beginning episodes.
B000I0QK74|5.0|What a pleasant surprise to find that James Taylor finally made a Christmas Album. He had made one the year before for Hallmark but this one contains several more selections (I have the Hallmark CD as well) James Taylor puts his own style to old standards and several songs I wouldn't consider Christmas Songs...such as The River or Go Tell It On the Mountain. All in all a very polished CD and a must have for any Christmas Music collection and or James Taylor fan. Well done and worth the price
B00009UW0N|5.0|I love this movie and this DVD is wonderful.
B000GG4XJM|5.0|Great CD; singing was superb and the songs were all songs I remember from college days.  A real touch of the past done well.  Perfect for singing along.
032147404X|4.0|I am not a pro... Photography is a hobby I am growing into... this book is great! My only wish was that it had a bit more stuff for point and shoot cameras... but otherwise it rocks!

B00005JPAM|5.0|Highly recommended to anyone who appreciates a good story, THE QUEEN recounts the first week after Diana Spencer's death from the perspective of Queen Elizabeth and Tony Blair, expertly portrayed by both Best Actress shoo-in Helen Mirren and Michael Sheen.<br /><br />A well-organized collage of news footage and dramatic reenactments, this is a great movie that focuses on the royal family's steadfast refusal to address the British public about the former princess's fatal car crash - despite the prime minister's incessant pleas for the Queen to make a televised statement.<br /><br />Though I suspect the Brits will see this differently, from my perspective, THE QUEEN is a study of head-in-the-sand loyalty to tradition and what happens when the unpredictable and unprecedented happens to inflexible, robotic royals. But I bet for the Brits, with a story as recent as this one, there are as many interpretations of this film as there are English citizens.<br /><br />Regardless it's not just Mirren and Sheen who shine here.  James Cromwell (the farmer from Babe) plays a spot-on Prince Philip, the Queen's traditionalist husband.  Alex Jennings delivers a convincingly vulnerable Prince Charles, whose pesky ex-wife has suddenly captured his nation's vigilant sympathy.  And Helen McCrory offers a fascinating Cherie Blair, the prime minister's anti-monarchist wife who suspects her husband's sympathy toward the Queen stems from a son's respect for his stoic mother.<br /><br />All in all THE QUEEN is a great flick that could entertain everyone, regardless of their interest in England's dysfunctional royal family.<br /><br />-- Regina McMenamin
B000CNFC76|5.0|Great viewing for the whole family, especially fun for those of us who enjoy golf, but a good story line that anyone can get into.  Liked knowing that it is based on a true story.
B000683VI4|5.0|One of the sweetest, most romantic, realistic movies I've seen in a very long time.  I've watched it about 15 times and enjoy it each time as if it is the first time.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|My whole family loves this series.  The humor is fast and subtle and the ensemble of charachters is terrific.  We saw the movie Serenity in the theater and enjoyed it but were a little confused.  After watching this entire series the movie makes much more sense and we are now big fans!
B000GIWS7E|5.0|My favorite band is RUSH.  My favorite group of musicians is Dream Theater.  Most bands have a member the general public considers \\"weaker\\" than the others.  This not the case with DT.  Watching Portnoy play complicated drum patterns with ease and a smile on his face is just wonderful.  This band is simply the most talented rock band ever assembled.  You must get this.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Wonderful!  Watching this series without the commercial interuptions is such a pleasure.  I was surprised at how many episodes I had missed over the years, so watching from very beginning has be so entertaining.  Looking forward to hours and hours of excellent viewing.  Highly recommend.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This production is of the finest I have seen in a long time.  The plot, acting, costumes, music, choreography, and direction are superb.  I can imagine only one period piece that could rival this DVD:  Pride and Prejudice (1995).  The fact that few people know of this excellent production is bewildering to me, to say the least.  I highly recommend it to all viewers.
B00005JP4U|5.0|\\"Wake Up Everybody\\" This movie is our Reality! \\"Planet Earth is the place we live\\". There are no Politics here. The whole program is based on Real Scientific Evidence and Facts. Locally and Globally we need better leadership to clean up the mess that we are making of our planet. The star scale does not go high enough to rate this movie. Like Carl Sagan says \\"Billions and Billions of Stars\\". I still feel the Pain that Al Gore is not our current Leader. Sincere Thanks to Al Gore and all of the people involved, for the tremendous effort that all of you have done putting this program together, for All of Us to Learn. Al your presentation is Excellent! Now it is up to All of Us to do the Right Things and there are many!
0920668372|5.0|This book touched my heart.  Having children I think every parent should <br />sit and read this book.  I passed this book on to my daughter who just <br />had a baby and she was touched as much as I was.
0763631205|5.0|An absolutely beautiful version of one of my favorite stories!  I really hope the boy I bought it for is enjoying it because I hated to give it away!
B000JJS8TM|5.0|I listened to the CD and it gave me that feeling I experienced when I first heard Sgt. Pepper or Abbey Road for the first time. That's a good thing! Nobody knows the tracks better nor could have improved them without Sir George Martin at the helm. Give it a spin and feel like a kid again.
B000JJ4GW0|5.0|A perfect blend of U2's great music -- old favorites and awesome new ones, such as The Saints Are Coming and Window in the Sky.   Only U2 can warm the heart and soul like this album does.  Leaves you dancing one minute and crying the next. There is no other band this wonderful.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|This is a good all around version of the Christmas Carol.  It is a fun musical with great messages for all.
6305428042|5.0|I bought this for my daughter who has loved the film for a long time. It is a wonderfully fun film to watch during the Halloween season. I would recommend it to anyone who has children or even adults it's a great film.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I needed to see this. I'm a \\"facts & figures\\" type of person & this really helped me understand the severity of the current global warming issues. I was VERY impressed by this movie, not only because of all the supporting information, but also because of his soft, non-political approach that really allows you to come to your own decision about how much this matters to you in your own life. Anyway, I support this movie wholeheartedly & bought 4 copies just to give/lend to friends. :)
B000H5U832|5.0|This product came in a very short time, and the price was less than I could have purchased the dvd here in the stores.   Including the shipping.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|Great movie. Takes place in 1909 when the World's Fair was coming to St. Louis. Entire cast works well together. I love this movie. One of my favorites.
0739313118|5.0|I read the Da Vinci Code at the apex of its hype in the media.  I was swayed by the push of religious zealots to decry the myth.  I found myself continually asking what on earth is wrong with people.  What don't they comprehend about fiction.  Fiction is a mass of make believe woven with threads of some fact.  You can't take a work of fiction as seriously as you do a personal diary, journal, or historical document.  Because of that I missed the important message of the book.<br /><br />I saw the movie and understood why a lot of people didn't like it.  If you didn't read the book it was difficult to follow.  If you read the book, you couldn't help but tsk that Tom Hanks, normally a top actor, ruined this role completely.  He just didn't fit.  The director was horrible portraying two strong characters as weak ignorant dweedle dums, while the villian was brilliant.  The movie was also corrupted by the screenwriter that under did and over did portions of the book.  The screenwriter tried to mix to much action with symbolism, and failed at both.<br /><br />Then I listened to the unabridged audio book.  I reprimanded myself for missing so much.  Dan Brown gives us a magical, mystical, and totally wonderful history lesson.  Beneath the lines is something far more than meets the eyes, and hits the ears.  It isn't about religion and goddesses, it is all about sociology and the development of psychology mixed with sociology to define a society.  Marvelous Mr. Brown, just marvelous.  I highly recommend this as a read and hear book.  I look forward to the another Dan Brown novel.  I have read them all and listened to the three.  Comprehensive society study there.  Under the lines is Dan Brown's codes.<br /><br />Enjoy
B000K7VHQE|5.0|Hilarious comedy that makes you think a little. Great performances by the entire cast.
0307236722|5.0|I enjoy all of Martha's books. This has a lot of good tips on baking. It would be good for new and experienced bakers. <br />Thanks Martha
B0000CABJ1|5.0|Donna Summer is a Diva of all times. I listen to this CD <br />over and over again. Her vocals are outstanding and her music <br />is timeless.
B0000032LS|5.0|Even though the days of Rocky Horror being the midnight movie every Saturday night are gone, it is nice to re-live that era occasionally at home.  Adding dialogue is still fun, but unless you have the carpet cleaner scheduled for the next day you better leave it at that!
B00005LC1H|5.0|What can I add that my title has not already said, in my opinion this is the finest Situation Comedy ever made anywhere, U.K., U.S. or anywhere else., A True Classic and the DVD boxed set was very well done with lots if great extras.
B00006D295|5.0|Original cast (Richard O'Brien, Barry Bostwick, Susan Sarandon, Tim Curry) soundtrack of the theatrical version made famous in Midnight Movie show houses across America in the 70's and 80's.  This is an extremely rare example of a movie being better than stage.  Richard O'Brien and Jim Sharman did a great job making the converting the play to film!
