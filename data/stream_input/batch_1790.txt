B0061Q13V2|5.0|Dominique does an excellent job telling her whole story - gymnastics and after.  There was so much I didnt know about her life and she didn't hold anything back.  Like others I assumed some things about Bela and the gymnastics world in general and this painted a very different picture.  Her writing flowed from one story to the next.  I didn't want to put the book down.  I have so much respect for Dominique after reading this.  If you are a fan of gymnastics you will love this.  If you aren't interested in gymnastics, you will still love this.  Dominique's story is very relatable and a must read for anyone struggling with how to move forward in life.  Seeing how Dominique picked herself up over and over again is sure to inspire.
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|Although not a fan of vampire fantasy, I found this book fairly interesting. I forgot the characters were all witches and vampires and kind of liked them as human beings. However, not particularly interested in what happens next.
B002GZQYMK|2.0|It certainly does not come close to Black Holes & Revelations not even close, The 2nd Law is better than this one. Too much use of synth in this album and not at all rock oriented as in the previous 4 albums before this. This sounds more orchestral than anything and it wasn't that good. Bellamy's voice in here was toned down more than in any other album and the songs were somehow forgettable after the 2nd song on the album. I expected better in this album instead I found myself skipping a lot of songs, something I don't usually do. Muse went towards a totally different direction in this one and it was somehow lackluster.
0547884591|5.0|Love this newest addition to the 4-hour family. Only wish they came faster!<br /><br />The language section and index are particularly helpful.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Having grown up watching the movie based on this book, I was curious and wanted to read the original story.  I really enjoyed it and think it is still a wonderful book for younger children.  The are a few words that are no longer used in everyday language, like \\"humbug\\", but is still a sweet story and holds it's place in the list of fun children's classic stories.<br /><br />This will not appeal to the jaded reader who requires non stop violence and special effects action. But for those who enjoy a sweet, well written story written for a younger, more innocent child, this story should be in your library.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I am really enjoying this free ap!  If you like card games you can play by yourself, give this one a try. great for traveling too
B009E20IB6|3.0|while I read the stories I cant say that it was exiciting. This great writer should use his time with something more dramatic
1593272200|4.0|This is a good reference book with a lot of examples.  My only complaint is the format of the pages.  There is no gutter such that the even numbered pages are sometimes hard to read without pulling on the page or flattening the book.  This makes it difficult to read the even numbered pages with both hands, for example, on a computer keyboard.
B00881PPTO|1.0|this app is sad. I pretty much know for a fact that all the cheaper Airlines are not even listed on here and you have to call them. I think that this app get a serious kick back from the airlines that they suggest if you book a flight through them. I believe that this company is a weak attempt to try to locate cheap flights and should not even exist.
0345529057|5.0|This was a great deal for these books. They came in great condition. I would recommend these books for anyone who is a fan of fantasy or mid evil tales.
B00984668E|5.0|The Sword continue to grow as a band and each offering is slightly better than the last.  Their music is of the same vein as Black Sabbath with lyrics that remind you of something the late, great Ronnie James Dio would write.  If you are a fan of that type of music, definitely check it out.  This album is well worth your time and money.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Its a great book but you have to stay to it till the end!  Hard at some parts but a great read.
B0071WQ7WU|2.0|I was very much looking forward to this album after the excellent and hard hitting 'Sound of Madness' but was sorely dissapointed.  There are a couple of tracks that stand out (namely the first two : Adrenaline and the first single Bully), but most of the album is cookie-cutter radio pop-rock.  If you are looking for a great cd from this great band check out the aforementioned 'Sound of Madness' or their major debut 'Leave a Whisper'.
B008DM4OTA|4.0|Cute game I just wish Amazon would stop giving us kid games for free all the time. We are adults and there are plenty of other apps that would suit our needs other that these games. I would like to see something good be given away for free.
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|The irst season was much better.  This one was ok. Too gorey & more shock value than a good story.
0593020073|5.0|This was recommended to me by a counsellor about a year ago.  I have since recommended it to some friends, as it is very helpful.  The book itself is rather old, but the subject matter is even older.  It opened my eyes to a lot of rubbish I've been dealing with since childhood, not just from my parents but from my grandparents and older sibling as well.<br /><br />Doctor Forward not only helps the reader identify toxic relationships between family members, but also shows how to start the healing process.  She advises that the reader seek professional therapy in addition to using her techniques.  The techniques themselves seem simple enough, but can me emotionally draining.  I have compared it to lancing an abscess: the gunk inside is released and the wound(s) is (are) allowed to heal properly.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I completely enjoy playing the games. I have spent hrs enjoying them. It is nice that lot of ages can play the games.

B000SO7OL6|5.0|This girl has lots of talent and we love mostly everything she sings and she'a a very accomplished jazz piano player as well. This whole album is great!
0061765236|1.0|I have to say that I did enjoy reading it but it is the ending that vexed me. You are waiting for this mistery to be solved and when you get to the end you are terribly disappointed. Throughout it is a good read, kind of a trial novel like one of John Grisham, but it all looses any sense when you finish it.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|This is part of the Outlander series. It is a great story, but ver long. Once it grabs your attention, it doesn't let you go.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Bought this on \\"Black Friday\\" for $4.99.  My daughter asks to watch it everyday!  The story is educational and the cartoon is comical.
0143038095|4.0|This book is about the lives of Chinese women immigrants and their first-generation American daughters. We learn what it means to be Chinese through the eyes of both the mothers and the daughters. From each different perspective the reader learns how their lives have shaped how they think and view the world. When I read from the perspective of the daughters I felt like stomping my feet and screaming like a teenager over how their mothers treated them. Later when I read from the mother's perspective I was ashamed and also heart broken. I loved learning more details about the Chinese culture and experiencing the heartache that came with seeing the next generation lose some of that culture. This is an amazing read!
0547884591|5.0|Like Tim's first two books, this one rocks.  In the World we live in, where it seems that everyday, everything becomes more complicated this book not only preaches cutting to the chase, but tells you how to do it.  And, it may be applied to almost anything!!.  Thank You Tim!!!  I cannot wait to see what you can come up with next.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Killer Book!  Couldn't put it down.  Highly reccomend...right up there with Hunger Games and Twilight.<br />I used my Kindle to read it.
B007KOYEOC|1.0|Go to the web and get better porn for free. It is soooooo badly written with unbelievable characters. so bad
B009FZFONO|4.0|Season 3 was much better written than season 2.  The story line flows and the compelling issues and human struggles depicted in the midst of a zombie world inspire reflection on the character of our own humanity.
B006YXTRHY|4.0|Bella finally says yes and a series of events allows her to get her wish far sooner than one would expect.  Worth seeing.
B001OKGX92|4.0|Movie is great!  I had problems downloading to Amazon UNBOX.  Ater serveral attempts I still have not been able to download to pc.  Is in my library on MYAMAZON.COM so it is okay for now.  The issue is being worked.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Loved the perspective, the humor and the philosophy of Enzo.  This book was easy read and hard to put down.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|I don't remember ever being this enthralled by a tv show. I have not been able to miss an episode. The writers are amazing, they make you relate to the characters. I really wish the seasons were longer.
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|I was expecting more action, but overall it was a good entertainer, with a good star cast. It is good for a one time watch.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|A frustrating story of oppression but extremely well written. Pre-Civil War story of the abuses that may have happened through-out slavery.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I play the computer minecraftn so this game needs more stuff but its an okay game but I like it little bit
B007HC3LHS|4.0|Lots of twists and turns which keeps you guessing as to the outcome!  It's well worth the read and teaches a great lesson regarding our inner fears...
B008VBYN80|3.0|Nothing to spectacular but addicting and time consuming if you have nothing else to do. Plenty of better apps to waste time on.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|What a yummy read!  I LOVE the characters, such spirit and fire.  I really love the storyline and the way the author builds and builds and builds the plots and scenes.  I can't wait to reread it.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|This movie is another hit of Johnny Depp. He plays his heart out and will not let you down. When he plays , his sole is in it. I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Dark Shadows and of Johnny Depp.
0385535147|5.0|Enjoyed this one too!<br />Great reading and suspence. He kept it interesting and wanting to read more<br /> I could read again
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Here's another one you just can't put down till the end.  Follett is one of the best!  His research is impeccable.
B007M45PMU|5.0|good listen. Merges with singer/songwriters for good casual mix.  Ho hey is first single, but others may come from this listen.

B005NJU8PA|2.0|I have read Tim Ferris's 4-Hour Body and 4-Hour Workweek, and thought they were somewhat inspiring, if not a but unconventional, but 4-Hour Chef falls short.  It's weird.  It will not teach you how to cook.  It will teach you how to be a spoiled, narcissistic, trying to be a know-it-all.  Don't waste your money on this book.  Tim's 15 minutes of fame should be over.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|love this movie! keeps the magic alive in you. definitely perfect for watching together on Christmas eve. a must have for your holiday movie collection.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is the gift I'm giving to my fellow bookworms for Christmas. I love this collection. I truly enjoyed the characters, even the ones I'm supposed to despise. The mechanics of these stories drew me in, no pun intended. The human aspect of these stories is what really makes them a universal hit in my mind. I found myself staying up all night, simply captivated.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|It was OK for the first 3 or 4 days, I thought the only problem would be a really tight plug-in, which was to some extent tolerable according to its price. But after those days when I connect my Kindle with it onto my computer, my Kindle will not get recognized. I bought a used one from the Wireless Central for the cheaper price, but now I have to buy another cable from the official store.<br /><br />*UPDATE Dec 5*<br /><br />The customer service of Wireless Central contacted me, and I got my refund. Appreciate their following-up for customers' comments, I'll take back partly my former comment. Anyway, think twice when you purchase a \\"used\\" cable of this kind!
B008S80OU2|5.0|I was really excited when this arrived at my door on it's release day! I already owned most of this in one form or the other, but to get the excellent box set with the latest masters of all the Columbia material and the bonus stuff made me feel like Heavy Metal Santa had just come to my house!<br /><br />All the original artwork, and the discs all have the same art as the original labels on the lp's! An informative booklet, and all the really great bonus material is so well put together that my only unfilled wish is that B&Ouml;C would come to my little town and perform with all 5 original members!<br /><br />The extras are really great, including the Steven King spoken intro for the Astronomy video from Imaginos, the long wished-for recording of &#34;Wings of Mercury,&#34; and a lot of other really cool stuff, but a real stand-out here is &#34;Rebel,&#34; which is the same music as &#34;Shadow Warrior&#34; from Club Ninja, with different lyrics.<br /><br />I heartily recommend this to fans of The Blue &Ouml;yster Cult!
0446547573|5.0|I ordered this book for my daughter.. I've since discussed the book with her and she had informed me it was an excellent read.. She loved it. Thanks
B00940XIGU|5.0|Finally an album where I love every single song.  I would highly recommend this album to anyone who loves techno.
B004132HZS|3.0|I doubt that this little needle will be found in the haystack of reviews, but I'll have a go at it nonetheless, realizing that I'm no doubt going to unconsciously repeat the thoughts of previous commenters. (That's a big haystack, and I certainly haven't read all the other reviews by a longshot.) But on with my own brief take, which is mixed. Truly iconic fictional characters like Sherlock Holmes and Superman have their own mythology, of course, but if a character has enough power to cross generations then that mythology can often develop an amazing amount of flexibility as each successive generation remolds the character to suite time and taste. Does Superman fly or does he just leap? How many varieties of Kryptonite are there, or does Kryptonite even exist? Does Superman have super-powers because of Earth's yellow sun or not? The details change, but certain aspects of Superman do not. Change them and you have a character called Superman who is really a different entity. For me, that's how I approach this updating of the Sherlock Holmes mythos. On some levels, I have to say that the updating is done in an incredibly clever manner. Some elements, such as the \\"three-patch problem,\\" are utterly brilliant. Others, such as Watson having fought in Afghanistan after 9/11, are rather facile yet no less engaging. Beyond this well-wrought devices to fit Holmes into the 21st Century, however, the series utterly fails to bring him to the present because the character himself has been changed too much. Visually, Benedict Cumberbatch is an excellent Holmes. The problem comes when he opens his mouth. As Cumberbatch is forced to play him by the script, Holmes seems to be a borderline psychopath, divorced from any moral imperative and seemingly viewing others as mere objects in a grand game. The \\"real\\" Holmes as written by A.C. Doyle may have been eccentric at times, but he was always concerned with moral justice and possessed a strong empathy for others, even though that latter quality may have occasionally been well-disguised. The fact is, this is not Sherlock Holmes, just a different character with some of his traits who signs his name as Sherlock Holmes. Similarly, the characters of Mycroft Holmes and Professor Moriarty are completely untrue to their \\"original\\" conceptions -- Doyle's Moriarty may have been insane in his own way, but at least he was rational in his insanity. As noted by others, the Study in Pink episode is the strongest of the three, while The Blind Banker descends into embarrassing stereotypes and contrived plot devices, and The Great Game is nothing if not absurd to the point of being boring. On the whole, I have to give this three stars because of the inventiveness shown in creating a plausible modern setting for Holmes. I just wish the real Holmes and his entourage had actually been plopped down in that setting. Instead, we get different, almost repellent characters inhabiting that environment. And that's a shame.
B00A77II0U|5.0|This was a really fun mixture of hidden objects,  puzzles,  and point &amp; click type stuff! A little on the easy side but weird &amp; fun story line. Loved it!
B009OYSFDM|4.0|I do like the development of each character(need to know more about Speedy though) as the season progresses and we learn more about various people's pasts secrets or past relationships. Sometimes it seems the show tries to force 1 bad person 'down' per episode which makes that episode too rushed and less enjoyable. I also feel it could use a stronger underlying plot that spans the many episodes to provide a strong framework to support the ongoing plot of &#34;taking down people in a book&#34; - what happens when we run out of people in the book for example? Based on things right now, Arrow would be done. However with that said, I still enjoy the season and hope it continues to strengthen as time passes.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I couldn't stop reading it...so I didn't. I read it in one day!! Will definitely be reading more of her books! Great characters. Great story. Great ending.
B005SS2QXS|4.0|For the price and for what I needed this case/cover to do, it is a great fit for my iPhone 4.  Snug fit, access to the headphone jack and mute switch is excellent and the bottom opening is great for both speaker function and connection to the other cord.  Just what I needed!
B0012GTZC0|3.0|set in WWII this spy novel relied on human skill rather than computer technology. The human spirit of survival fueled the superhuman strength of ordinary people.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|This album is extraordinary.  'The New Breed' is as good as anything on Aja, and it gets no better than Aja.  'Slinky Thing', 'Good Stuff' and 'Planet D'Rhonda' are similarly amazing.<br /><br />Thank you Mr. Fagen.  Please take this material on the road.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I like the fact that I can play this on my kindle. I used to play Zynga  but that is not as accessible on my device. This gives me the distraction with out the draw backs of the Zynga games.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|I had avoided all the other iterations of Angry Birds but this combo with Star Wars intrigued me to much.<br />I haven't gotten too far in the &#34;story&#34; but am loving it. I love the little videos and the fact that you can &#34;shoot&#34;<br />Tie Fighters in the opening and shoot other stuff in the scenario selection screens (pig troopers, space junk,<br />etc.) Good game with some thinking involved (like all physics based games).
B009FZFONO|5.0|This show has an awesome storyline.  Engaging from the first season till now.  You do, however, need to enjoy zombies in order to understand and enjoy the show.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|Except for a  few odd instances where the game has just dropped me back to my home screen, this game has been quite<br />satisfying - challenging but not frustrating, beautiful graphics, nice soundtrack. Now to find the other items I need to go on!
B000FCK65W|5.0|This book is timeless in it's appeal to the generations since it was written. I loved it as a teenager, and loved it even more as a grandmother. It shows how enduring the power of love is even though we have serious flaws. When we as children are loved unconditionally, we can grow to do great things,in spite of poverty and other adversities. We in turn learn to love unconditionally too.
141970642X|5.0|This book made me realize that there are many steps for movie making. Like I thought you filmed a movie beginning to end but I was wrong.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I WISH I COULD RECEIVE MORE CREDITS TO BUY CARDS, AS BINGO IS MY FAVORITE GAME.  HOIW DO I GET MORE CREDITS?
B005LAIHYU|5.0|This movie is amazing. I bought the DVD from Amazon and I am not disappointed. I've already watched it twice since I got it! Definitely get this.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|This book was definitely a new twist on military sci fi!  I read a lot, and I highly recommend it!
B00AE2IJIE|1.0|Sick, disgusting, and quite sickening. A poor excuse for a kids movie. I wouldn't reccomend watching this with your pet. A rip off if it was free.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This series is simply amazing it shows how large of a distance there actually was between the aristocrat and the popper.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Just read this book in a day and a half- and it's a long book!  I literally was up all night and couldn't put it down!  It was a scary story, in fact after reading it all day, I went to Ikea at night and the store was almost empty and I actually felt a little scared- it's just one of those books that stays with you.  I'm not going to get into the story and ruin it for you, but get it, you won't be sorry!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This is a really great series.  Well written and Well acted.  It is extremely thought provoking-not everything is black and white
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|It won't accept any city other than Los Angeles and even the time for  that location is incorrect.  I'm on the East coast, so what good is that?
B002ZG999U|5.0|More action, more laughter, more excitement.  Great cast.  The story was predictable, but there was a lot that was going on that added to the movie.
B007REV4YI|2.0|I was really looking forward to seeing this... so much so that I went to the theater to see it. After Daniel Craig's first two installments (Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace) as Bond (he's excellent as James Bond), I thought 'SkyFall would be equally as good.... instead, what we got was a way too long movie with lots of lulls (dead spots) in it... Some of the action scenes are excellent... but there's not enough of them... and a super-villian... really?
B009MF5BXK|3.0|It started off slow -- introducing the characters; but it picked up the pace a little.  The story was good.
B000002A46|5.0|Some of the best singing on planet Earth, phenomenal production, and uplifting Christian lyrics. This album has classics that are untouchable by other singers, like O Holy Night.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|A very good books. Corky, enlightning,<br />Cute and funny. This. Book shows that anyone can and will find love. A must read.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Steven King's, &#34;11/22/63&#34; not only held my complete interest from the beginning to the end, this is the first book in...? This is the first  book in years that I absolutely could not put down. As I consider the  &#34;fifties&#34; as my era, I was amazed at the remembrances of those ten years that this book brought forward. I could not wait to the end to see how our world turned out, but then, and this, at least for me, &#34;11/22/63&#34; is the kind of book that I also hated to see end.<br />M. Lichterman
B00457WZEI|5.0|I have always loved horses - I wanted to see the movie and most probably will rent it - this really pulls at your heart strings even if you don't love horses as I do.
B009K0P10K|4.0|It was very interesting, there was not a lot of bedroom scenes (as compared to Grey's Anatomy).  The picture quality was very good. This is the best way to watch series, you don't have the commercial!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I'd would highly recommend this series (I've read all 3) and will not be able to put them down once you start reading.
B009B50QOU|5.0|having listened to this all the way through i definitely enjoyed all the tracks. Definitely looking forward to purchasing Dos and Tres, and Kill the DJ sounds alot like Robot Rock to me. Get it if you're a big Greenday fan!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I've read all three in the series and loved them all and so will you - you become part of their life
B000RJO57I|5.0|great comedy, even better than i remember having watched it again this year. Definitely worth a watch if you've already seen Shaun of the Dead, or you are a fan of cop movies.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have read all three and just couldn't put them down....You will be pulled into their love story form the very first word...
B0061S073A|3.0|good app not as easy to use as the kindle free time app but it does a good job keeping kids out of areas you don't want them in.
0525952926|5.0|Another excellent work by Ken Follett.  I enjoyed this book immensely.  I would suggest it for any Ken Follett fan.
B006CDCWDM|5.0|I loved this book. I found out many aspects about Rafa's life and past I did not know. It's very easy to read. Because it is very entertaning you can read this book really fast. Or at least for me it was very easy to read because I was very intrigued in its content. Highly recommended.
1400067820|5.0|Antifragile is Nassim Nicholas Taleb's best book, but that doesn't mean start here.  Antifragile assumes an awareness of how randomness, particular the randomness of rare extreme events, ruins our ability to predict.  Antifragile contains the strategies for coping with the random world.  For readers enlightened, but anxious after The Black Swan, the mix of strategies, wit, and historical references is soothing.<br />The path to antifragility starts with replacing predictions with assessments about the underlying mechanics of systems.  Systems are either fragile, robust, or antifragile.  Whether a system is fragile or antifragile depends on the asymmetries between costs and benefits and if the costs or benefits increase nonlinearly in increasingly extreme cases.<br /><br />So how does one create robust or antifragile systems?<br /><br />Evolutionary stresses make natural systems antifragile: things that can fail, given enough time will fail. Rather trying to identify the attributes of success, it is more helpful to look at what does not fail.  Another attribute of natural systems that makes them robust is their ability to overcompensate.  Stressors prompt the system to build excess capacity to prepare to handle future stresses.<br /><br />\\"Complex systems are weakened, even killed, when deprived of stressors.  Depriving systems of stressors, vital stressors, is not necessarily a good thing, and can be downright harmful.  Consider a case when the poisonous substance, in some dose, makes you better off overall.\\"<br /><br />\\"It is quite perplexing that those from whom we have benefited the most aren't those who have tried to help us, but rather those who have actively tried - but eventually failed - to do us harm.\\"<br /><br />Options are another path to antifragility.  This is the thesis of The Strategy Paradox: because you can't predict which options will pay off, you should focus on creating new options and capitalizing on the options that do pay off.  The barbell strategy is a method of creating options to benefit for rare random events while staying protected from the costs of rare random events.  The majority of resources are invested in no risk options while the remaining resources are invested in many small, risky bets.<br /><br />\\"My idea of the modern Stoic sage is someone who transforms fear into prudence, pain into information, mistakes into initiation, and desire into undertaking.\\"<br /><br />The style is very similar to the Black Swan.  Taleb doubts many things but he does not doubt himself.  One of Taleb's main targets is formal academic knowledge, he prefers experimentally derived heuristics.  Knowledge can benefit from evolutionary forces too, many instincts and ancient saying are consistent with the concept of antifragility, even if there wasn't a word for it.  Knowledge is deeper than what can be expressed in words.<br /><br />The Black Swan changed how I viewed the world, but it really didn't change my behavior.  I am hoping I change my behavior after Antifragile.  I would like to use stressor to improve and master the barbell strategy - execute and take small risks.
B0018S6YO4|5.0|Got it on time. Thanks again made Christmas shopping easier. But I wish I could cancel the other item that was supposed to ship out with it.
B007REV4T8|5.0|This is an Oscar-worthy Bond movie. I never thought that I would use those words in the same sentence, but it's true. The viewer learns something about Bond, his history, his early life, and most importantly, his motivation. We learn of a character who is much deeper than his alcoholic playboy image of past movies. Devoid of fancy toys, there are no Deus ex Machina gadgets to save him, only his wits and his failing, yet still considerable athleticism. Perhaps best of all, we discover a Bond who wills himself to win, not for animalistic domination, but through an inner sense of nobility and honor.
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|Great story. What I would expect from an author like Brandon Sanderson. Unlike many of his books, compact and to the point. Wonderful spin-off of Elantris.
B007M45PMU|5.0|Love this for two reasons, one it is this new Mumford and Son style that I really like.  The second is I really love sharing music with my 13 year old.  She flits into some Rap and other stuff I can't stand and she is tired of my country music so a middle ground of a new band we both like is so fun.
0767810856|5.0|I had VHS but I wanted to have DVD too.<br />I don't knw why Cage (Cop) married such a stupit woman.<br />It was so funny.
B009HEMJCW|4.0|Love how the story gives a great lesson in self acknowledgment and love, wrapped in a sweet fun story.  My kids love it as well, counts for alot.
B0090EIILU|1.0|I somewhat enjoy Cohen's movies.  His movies are kind of like watching a train wreck: don't really want to watch but can't look away.  This one, however, wasn't even mildly entertaining to me.  I was downright bored.  My boyfriend, for whom we ordered it on Prime, didn't like it much either.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|All of Clavell's works are very good but this is the book that got me hooked. A must read for everyone.
B0086700CM|5.0|I just updated temple run and I cant wait to get the new stuff. now aboutb everybody I know has this game. (well if they have some device)
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Ah was ok seemed like the author didn't want too write anymore. I liked the first two books alot better.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is awesome! I love this game its so addicting! I cant stop playing this game! I rated this five stars because its such an amazing game! and you even get to beat ur friends high scores through Facebooks!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|101 games in one is a really good time killer. Yes, it has false advretizing and yes ypu have to unlock alot of the games but overall, it is a decent game. Sometimes I would just sit down and play and before you know it, it's been 2 hours aready. All of it's games have a good concept but, most of them are exact copies of other games. Now, for the controls, Good Gravy, the controls are just plain awful!!! You have to be at the exact right time for the device to respond. Now, with the unlocking issue that seems to be bugging everyone, I don't really mind it. For example one of the games cost 90,000 tokens. That seems alot but trust me, the game constantly gives you free tokens so you won't have to buy any. Overall, 101 games is a pretty OK game and I guess it is worth a download. -Guy
B000063UR2|5.0|This is a unicorn story of real people in a mythological world of amazing beauty until a girl symbolizing innocence touches a unicorn.  This allows the devil's demon to shoot the animal with a poison dart, which ends the bright and beautiful world and brings on winter and darkness.  Jack the hero must battle against evil to save the world from perpetual darkness, and he enlists the aid of an amazing group of elves and fairies to help him conquer all obstacles.  The big D (Lucifer himself) is like you have never seen him before, and he and his magic alone are worth seeing this show.  It is truly a magical gem with a happy ending as good conquers evil, but never destroys it.  As the big D fades off into space he says, &#34;What is light without darkness?&#34; touching on our duality of existence.  This may be too much for younger children because the witch and the big D are quite scary.  This is a delightful fairy tale for adults and older children.
B002OSY2T6|5.0|My daughter loves this snail and she is only 3 months old. I like the sound options so you don't have to listen to it loudly when it activates
B00773YOB4|5.0|To me the title song, is as poetic as Simon and Garfunkel's best, it's a beautiful song...This is a great album. I first heard it on NPR's 'First Listen' and although I could have recorded it on my computer or from my computer, I chose to buy it, since I liked it a great deal. I would recommend this to anyone who likes Bonnie, who likes the blues, or who just likes music. Lot's of good tracks, but as anyone can tell the song 'Slipstream' is superb in my opinion. There's a reason Fender made a &#34;Bonnie Raitt&#34; model. Buy the album.
0446577391|5.0|Baldacci was excellent, again.  His novels have never disappointed.  Baldacci's Camel Club novels are well written and flow easily for the reader.  Oliver Stone triumphs again!
B008I34ZUM|5.0|Frank leads his '73-'74 band through complex musical twists and turns resulting in a flawless jazz-n-roll concert album. With the exception of \\"Son Of Orange County\\" and \\"Trouble Every Day\\", this album followed Frank's tradition of presenting previously unheard songs on his live albums, rather than releasing live versions of songs we've already heard. Musicianship is top notch, overdubs are minimal and there's even some audience participation. If you like Frank's music, you need to get this. To add more of this sort of entertainment to your library, pick up \\"You Can't Do That On Stage Anymore- Volume 2 (The Helsinki Concert)\\". It's the perfect companion to \\"Roxy & Elsewhere\\"...the same band playing a lot of the same material, but even faster...
B009ESIGHI|5.0|This has been a family tradition for years. It has great music and great acting, perfect for the whole family.
B004LROUNG|2.0|This will be short and sweet.  Don't waste your time or money on this book.  I was more than halfway through the book and kept waiting for it to really get started.  It never happened.  I usually love John Grisham but it appears he just threw this on paper.
B000AYEL1A|5.0|Saw this picture when it first came out and my wife loved them both. Have to admit that I enjoyed it also, just a little late in getting the CD.
B005Y1SVKQ|1.0|I used this app extensively on mt iPhone with little or no problem  With the Kindle tablet, forget it .  It is a waste of time
B00001W9G0|5.0|My wife loves her and the purchase price was minimal. When the Boss loves it then everyone in the household is happy.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I rated &#34;The Last Man&#34; by Vince Flynn 5 stars!.  I have read all the books about Mitch Rapp and have enjoyed them all.  I really enjoyed this one because it showed a softer side of Rapp. However, it still had all the action that you expect in a Vince Flynn book.
B00AE9UYJ4|2.0|I thought it would be somewhat silmilar to the online game but its not. I found it very hard to control being you have the control on screen in your view. You also have to take your finger off control just to swipe and turn. it was to easy to get first four pages (under 1 minute) . The scare is not that great either. Save your money and stick to the computer game.
B008PZ69T8|3.0|I was overcome with the books. And knew the tastes were different but felt like I were at church or an opera which neither I tolerate.  I will be passing on to my dad who I think will get more out of this.
B005MJDJQQ|4.0|I am a huge fan of Kurt Wallander. The series is always a joy to read, and really fall into Kurt Wallander's Ystad environment. It's very encompassing and you get to know the various characters thoroughly. I'm also a fan of the British television series so it's fun to compare and contrast the novels. I won't spoil anything, but if you're thinking about reading the novels and have just seen the series or vice versa then know that they were not filmed in order at all and the television series differs quite a bit from the novels as far as characters and even plot points. I enjoyed this novel more than the episode of it. I found it very thrilling from start to finish, and pretty tragic when you realized who the villain was and their motivation. Mankell does a great job weaving the story from multiple viewpoints and really keeps the reader engrossed. This is yet another late into the night read when you get toward the end because you simply need to know how it all gets sorted out!
B005V4FJC4|4.0|Not my absolute favorite Christmas Album, but a very good one. They have a great sound. She & Him will bring you Christmas Cheer!
B009KHCT94|4.0|I had seen the trailer for this movie a long time before I actually got to view it. I wasn't expecting anything. Its a movie about nazi's on the moon. What more could you want? However, I was pleasantly surprised with the story and acting. There was just the right amount of self awareness to make the whole thing a lot of fun. The effects are very well done and it has an interesting visual style. It's actually a strange kind of Blazing Saddles-like experience.
B006RXPUR2|4.0|The movie had a good storyline. I enjoyed the acting as well, I would watch it again and that says something as I usually can't watch a movie more than once.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|Yes, it sounds preposterous, and it is, but it's fantasy!  so once you accept the idea, it all flows along.  It is, after all, a vampire movie.  Just fun and vamps and biting--with a historical twist.
B00A0A6F7C|4.0|This is nice, relasing music. Susan's voice is so soothing and beautiful. She can sing most anything, well. I think most would enjoy this CD.
B000SE0OYA|5.0|The product was just as described, it was shipped immediately and I received it just in time as expected. Thanks
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Different from the other Angry Bird games a little harder but it's fun to play. Even my 4 year old grandson is into playing it.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Until the end - what a disappointment!  I couldn't believe how abruptly it took a wrong turn.  Loved it until the very last chapter, so still worth the read.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Got this on a 'cyber Monday' deal and it was wonderful since my daughter loves it and we saw it in the theaters in 3D when it first came out.  She will be so excited to get to have it for Christmas!
0425263908|2.0|If you have read Fifty Shades of Grey, do not,,I repeat, DO NOT read Bared to You. It was a complete waste of my time. This book was a complete rip off of, and the story line was lame. I knew I made a mistake about 1/4 of the way thru the book. I was actually looking forward to this being a little better than FSOG, but this book was sleazy and too much like a dumb Soap Opera. Which is sad because it had the potential of being better. The author had plenty of opportunity to make the characters worth sympathizing with, but failed miserably. Throwing in a Dom/Sub issue was pointless and unnecessary. The Author is totally trying to capitalize on the FSOG phenomenon. I refuse to read the follow up, even though I purchase both during Black Friday. I wish I had not. If you are into Gay sex, by all means read the book.
1419705849|5.0|I bought this book for both my kids as they love the wimpy kid series. They are already finished. I hope more come out soon. It is the only series I have seen them read in less than 24 hours.
0061452068|5.0|We are constantly bombarded with doom-and-gloom prophesies, and this book puts that into perspective.  In reality, we are way better off than we ever were, and Ridley makes a convincing argument that things will continue to improve.<br /><br />My one criticism of this book is that Ridley shrugs off the doomsayers a bit too easily.  We need the doomsayers: it's important to have someone yelling, &#34;Watch out for that bus!&#34;  If it wasn't for all the fearmongering about Y2K, for example, would there have been armies of programmers fixing the computers before they broke?  I doubt it.  On the other hand, we currently put too much stock into the doomsayers.  Virtually everyone I know thinks the world is stepping merrily into the path of a whole convoy of buses and there's nothing we can do to stop it.  Ridley provides a lot historical evidence that shows people always believed that, yet here we are, better than ever.<br /><br />I was particularly interested in his views on our present-day problems.  Ridley states that many environmental initiatives actually hurt the environment more than they help.  He doesn't have me completely convinced.  At some point we will have to find a substitute for oil, and, if biodiesel isn't terrific right now, well, it's still being developed.<br />It seems like he's putting his faith in some technology that will be developed in the future while being dismissive of attempts to develop that technology today.  Nevertheless, he points out some valid concerns and has given me plenty of food for thought plus the desire to get different viewpoints on the subject, and the same goes for his stand on organic food and renewable resources and a host of other issues.<br /><br />Read this book.  It will make you think.  It will also make you feel better!
B004SOR4H6|5.0|It is an essential to have Twitter uploaded on to my Kindle to accompany my other favorite app which is Facebook.
B000OCXI3K|3.0|My first read of a book by Ms. Harris.  She is quite gifted.  Most of the narrative was predictable. I'll be interested in taking a look at some of her other writings.
B0098VXBIA|3.0|My husband's daughter was expecting when I watched this movie, so I was ready to be open-minded and enjoy the film.  Maybe I was too hard on the movie, because I don't have kids myself and can't relate, I don't know.  To me, it seemed like a waste of great talent.  I have watched these fine actresses in other movies I enjoyed much more.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I think its a good game because the kids can have there own adventures with twilight sparkle.But you have to remember to put on parental control to make sure they don't spend money.
B000IZC7WG|4.0|This movie was fast-paced and exciting.  I had to watch it twice to catch it all!  Great cast, great performances.
B005D9MUWY|1.0|I bought the app and installed it on my new Samsung Galaxy S3. And it has never been able to load on my phone.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show keeps getting better and better! Before watching it I thought it may be one note, but it is a roller coaster of emotions.... Gross to heart warming. Love it!
B000MCIBAW|4.0|another great album by the doors.  great arrangements of instruments, perfectly in sync.  great vocals and lyrics, but did jim really say &#34;baby gonna drown tonite&#34;  or &#34;baby don't drown tonite&#34; on moonlight drive?  either way it's a great song and album.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Great game for keeping your mind sharp!!! Graphics are great as well:-) I recommend trying this game, it holds your attention, at whatever pace you desire!!!
B008A5H78K|4.0|the doors were one of the greatest sounding groups in the sixties, not only because of three excellent musicians, but because they had jim morrison on lead vocal.  it would be hard for anyone to match jim's awesome voice.  He can croon like dean martin on &#34;wintertime love,&#34; strange vibe on &#34;five to one,&#34;  or just plain scream rock n roll on &#34;hello i love you.&#34;  a good album for anyone who is into sixties music.  peace baby.
B009P5S11G|5.0|The package was intact and well described. No complaints whatsoever. The gift wrapping system is also on point. I would recommend it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I haven't read the graphic novels, but this is by far one of the best shows out there. love that I can watch new episodes without cable and can't wait for it to end up on netflix.
B000FC1192|5.0|Such a change in your everyday piece of literature. The tale of Coraline is so enchanting with its sweetness, yet dark undertones, it leaves you curious of the author and wanting more. I would recommend it to anyone.
B000HF0ISC|5.0|An old movie filled with just about every Hollywood star!  Excellent acting and a plot that forces one to think about morals.  I've already recommended this movie to others!
B0076DELIG|4.0|Harry is an ordinary guy doing extraordinary things. He is not without faults but is truly a good person. His desire and hard work brings satisfying closure to good and evil people portrayed in this book.
B009FZFONO|5.0|The production values in this series are the best I've seen in a tv series in a long, long time.  The writing is spot-on and the characters are engrossing.  The dead provide constant tension to all of the story lines, but this series is not about zombies; it is about how people behave in a crisis.  Do they evolve or devolve?  Can they function in a group for the good of the group?  Can they put aside petty concerns and look at the big picture?  Can they cede control to another who is better qualified to lead in life-or-death situations?  Each episode comes with surprises, gasps, revelations and good old fashioned gory fun.  Watch this series!
B0086700CM|5.0|Best dash game I have played in a long time, it has given me hours of enjoyment.<br /><br />I would reccomend trying this out.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|I think this was one of Rod Stewart's best cd's.  The only thing I can say is just wonderful. It has you singing along with him.
B008SOS63S|5.0|I am a big fan of Joe Bonamassa, and have a few of his studio CDs.  I found that this live CD set wonderfully captures the extra vibrancy of his live performance.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|A beautiful story line with a fantastic twist or two.<br />His books are very short and to the point. Could have fleshed it out a bit more. Like his other books more.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Loved each of these related stories.  Wish Flynn would write faster and start a new character similar to this one.
0439023513|5.0|The perfect book for those of us who borrowed it from a work mate, then loaned it out to someone who didn't return it.
B005GRTNVE|5.0|I have always been a fa of Il Divo. Their voices are just superb. The setting in London was really a great choice. Carlos's sexual innuendo's are getting a bit old though.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|We LOVE madmen! Great character development and story lines, if you are here to purchase season 5, you probably already know that!
B009GEFXLC|2.0|I  have always been a fan of Castle and enjoyed the first four seasons. However, season 5 is a huge disappointment so far. I think the writers lost their touch. The episode with the film crew following the police around was just stupid and the Captain's fawning over them downright embarrassing. Monday night's episode with the Santa also left much to desire. Please writers, if you want to keep your fans, earn your salaries and do a better job. Just my opinion...
B008VBYN80|5.0|I have played Age of Empires for many years now. The fighting in this game adds a cool feel to a favorite style.
0099527936|1.0|When I purchased this book through Amazon, the picture of the book cover used to represent the product was a picture of the Arrow Books edition.  I have that edition already and was expecting to receive a virtually identical book.  The Arrow edition has good paper, is well bound, and has readable text.  What owlsbook sent me was a very poor substitute -- poor quality paper, small difficult to read font, and poorly bound, so that it is hard to keep the book open to read it.  Furthermore, the front cover is torn.<br /><br />My experiences with Amazon Marketplace have virtually always been good, but this was an exception to that rule.  I received two other books from this seller, and they were fine, but the copy of Harris's Archangel is junk.

B003MAQM6Q|3.0|This was my first time watching &#34;Fight Club.&#34; I knew the plot since it is a classic, but that didn't detract from the story. I enjoyed the acting and the mayhem. It's not something I would watch again, though I won't be able to put on a pair of kitchen gloves without feeling a lil' dirty.
1449320104|5.0|Another fantastic edition of C# in a Nutshell. I love these books because they are thorough but concise. Excellent for both reference and learning.

B009HQ9UHC|1.0|i do not care that everyone else likes this game. its silly and a waste of time. go get bubble blaster instead at least you can understand how to play it
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|This is an excellent book to read from whether it be that of for pleasure or as an assignment.  There is an enormous amount of action from the front cover to the back cover.  It is a great book to review, read, and definitely have in the library.  As a child and growing up into the adulthood, this has always been one of my favorite books to have in my library.  A great book to have in your library collection.

B0084AZXKK|5.0|Another classic book is Treasure Island.  It is wonderfully great and would be classified as the same as \\"Call of the Wild\\".  Treasure Island is a wonderful book that can be read from anywhere and everywhere including having the book on an island and being able to look for treasure.  Another timeless classic that has been past down throughout the generations and will continue to be passed down throughout the generations.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I am a voracious reader;and borrow books regularly from my town library.this is my first experience with an e-book purchase and it was a great read. I could not put it down. OCD and suspense;a great combination.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This was a great read, I read it over a 13 hour car trip, and never got bored because I had this book. This is a great story of love and a creepy but intriuging circus. The love story part was a little rushed, but other than that, my only complaint is that I wish this book was turned into a series so that I could see more of the circus and learn more about the characters.<br /><br />This book left me wanting so badly to go to the Night Circus. I really hope this becomes a movie so the circus can really come to life. The mystery and magic of it all was compelling, and I will deffinitely put this book on my self of books that I read over and over again.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|It was a little too disgusting and even sickening for me ln places, but l found l could hardly put it down.  I found myself so completely involved.  Therefore, five star.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I read this book in a day. A weekday, mind you. It consumed my thoughts! I loves it. Perhaps the best book of the trilogy (though its a tough call!) definitely recommend
B001UV4XFG|5.0|Great movie! You have to see them all! Watch the movies in order and try to watch them altogether if you can, so worth it!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great book! Love this trilogy and obviously couldn't stop at two! I'd recommend this book and theo other two for anyone over 12! Lots of drama, a little humor, a little romance, lots of action. Maybe the most action packed book of the three. Great read

B008673ZAQ|4.0|I enjoyed the read of this 50 Shades-ish series. While it's very similar to 50, the changes are good. I am awaiting the next installment....
B009439E7O|2.0|I own all their albums and will buy future ones. Amazing band. This album was hard to listen to due to lower vocals than instruments. This album is more screaming than previous albums and i struggled to enjoy parts of songs.

0316228532|5.0|The Casual Vacancy by J.K. Rowling. Warning: This book is full of flawed characters. In fact, in the first 150 pages, I nearly went mad trying to keep them straight. But indeed, I did \\"sort\\" them out. I kept wondering, why do I keep reading about these extremely flawed people? There's really no one to whom I can identify. But continue reading I did. And I was rewarded. The ending made me cry ... a lot. It's quite sad. I don't often read fiction, much less 500 pages of it, and I rarely cry, so Rowling hit a nerve. I even gained an insight. One of the characters reminded me of a \\"ne'er do well\\" I attended high school with. Because of this book, I see her, 45 years later, with more compassion. I'm not promising this will happen to you, but it's amazing how some stories can change your perspective. If a book can make me even a little bit more compassionate, I give it all the stars I can, since learning compassion is one of life's hardest lessons.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|The beauty in this app is the simplicity.  It is VERY easy to use and works great.  I tried several of the feature and am really impressed with the results.  This will be my go to app for simple Photo Enhancement.  Works awesome.
B009NOVCTM|4.0|This is the only fully career-spanning collection currently in print, available in two, three, and four CD editions. I picked up the 3 CD set although I already own all but the two new songs on CD, but I got this at a great price thanks to Amazon's Black Friday music deals.<br /><br />The song selection lacks some notable singles. Mother's Little Helper was a single-only release in the US and should be here. Instead we get the creepy psychedelia of We Love You which was only the B-side of Dandelion (also MIA). Of course there are fan favorites missing that many will demand inclusion, but really, this collection is for the casual fan who could care less about deep album tracks.<br /><br />Disc one's track order tells the compelling story of a British blues band that developed into a hit making machine. It begins with the frantic Chuck Berry cover that introduced the band to the US, through impeccable taste in soul and R&B covers, and the development of the Jagger/Richards songwriting team.<br /><br />Disc two kicks off with Jumping Jack Flash, the song that signaled to the world that the Stones were back after drug busts and the misguided sidestep into psychedelia. This is the meat of the Stones catalog and it's lean and mean. Then right in the middle of disc drops.....<br /><br />She's A Rainbow.<br /><br />This is a major faux pas and totally ignorant of the band's history. It's a good song, no doubt, but it belongs on disc one.<br /><br />Disc three comes out punching with the Stones' second golden age. But here is where some real gems are missing, and the collection begins to feel pinched for space. Respectable didn't even chart in the US, but it's here instead of the more familiar Shattered. She's So Cold and Hang Fire deserve inclusion as well. It's my personal preference that You Got Me Rocking is a much stronger entry than Love Is Strong, although the latter did chart a little higher. I love that the often overlooked Highwire is included, but Don't Stop from the 40 Licks comp doesn't belong.<br /><br />The comp ends with two new songs, included to get long-time fans like me who own every other CD by the band to shell out hard-earned cash for songs we already own. (Again, thanks Amazon for the Black Friday deep discount!) While I think Don't Stop and the other new songs on 40 Licks were weak, Doom And Gloom and One More Shot are better, but still suffer from comparison to all the great music you just heard on this set. They do give hope that the Stones still have some fire in the belly and want to make more great music, not just make more piles of money. As I type this, the band is continuing the 50 and Counting Tour, headed to Australia and New Zealand. Let's hope they can still give some great, new music in the future.<br /><br />Finally, a quick note about the remastered sound. Briefly, it's clear and clean and I have no quibbles with it, but it's not an improvement over the previous remastering.<br /><br />So if you're looking for a comprehensive Rolling Stones hits collection that concentrates on the 60s/early 70s period and cherry picks the rest, the unfortunately titled GRRR! fits the bill.the 40 Licks comp doesn't belong.<br /><br />The comp ends with two new songs, included to get long-time fans like me who own every other CD by the band to shell out hard-earned cash for songs we already own.

B0076DEJMO|5.0|Great books, have good character development, etc etc.<br /><br />The main protagonists are likeable and.... definitely have flaws. The antagonists are unaware they are so.

B00A0SQBDM|5.0|easy and fun to play. hint button recharges quickly so you always know what to do next. lovely graphics..worth buying.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I found this game to be both fun and a great tine killer. It is a great way to pass the time while in a car, bus, or just waiting around. Hard to believe a game this fun is free, so grab it while you have the chance.
0061148512|5.0|Sylvia Plath ended her own life wihich gives a certain mystery to this book. She has a good handle on the English language.
B0087GYY92|2.0|After John's excellent \\"Old Man's War\\" and \\"The Ghost Brigades\\" I was hoping for yet another well crafted, well plotted, highly plausible science fiction novel - but what did I get? A 'Star Trek' and 'Discworld' pastiche. The characters are thin, and the plot, even with the reader's 'willing suspension of disbelief' strain the bounds of plausibility. The idea that the plot line of a fictional science-fiction TV series could impact on the reality of the future I found just too implausible to swallow. There were echoes of 'Star Trek' as well as undertones of Terry Pratchett's 'Discworld' where the Narrativium rules, and it simply didn't work. Sorry John, you can do much better than this. Overall? Don't bother with this one.
B0042MDAL8|5.0|This is so far my favorite movie.  I love it.  The love between Bella and Edward is so strong.  It is great.
B003B02PFO|4.0|I saw the movie \\"Christmas with The Kanks\\" when it first came out and the DVD is wearing thin. LOL. That is why I couldn't wait yo buy this book.  Yes, many parts were different in SOME ways, but enjoyed it. Will I read it again? Oh yes!
B003IPC5SO|5.0|Love this CD.  It is very good.  I am such a Kylie fan.  She is so good.  Love all her stuff.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|This movie was fantastic!  Great story line. I laughed at Tommy Lee Jones and Meryl's characters. They were perfect. But the best part was the coming together parts. Talk about a tear jerker...in a good way.  Steve Carroll did a perfect job as the marriage counselor. Interesting to see him play a straight role. He was great.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I was a big fan of Myst and Riven, and The Lost City felt like it fit in with them. Solving puzzles, getting clues and pulling your hair out trying to figure out what you're supposed to do next all make this game really fun to play.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is the hint system (which I used once), it feels like it was added as an afterthought. It's more a walkthrough, telling you exactly what to do as opposed to giving hints. It also presents every single game hint from the very beginning, so you have to start at the first one and open every single hint until you find the one you're looking for.
B009K45Y62|5.0|I didn't see a code for the digital copy inside, did yours come with one? What should I do?<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Chris
B009FZFONO|5.0|The writing in this show is smart and sucks you in.  The challenges and survival of the characters you end up caring about.  The twists and turns keep you guessing what is coming next.  One of the best things on tv to watch period.
0446547646|2.0|I found this book a bit boring and very predictable, like a Lifetime movie.  Nicolas Sparks can do and has done so much better.
B008OHV4PG|5.0|Just an excellent documentary concert DVD.  I have played it over and over.  Neil Young is a treasure.  Long may he run!  Additionally - it should be noted - the concert included in this documentary is \\"Le  Noise\\" - which Young did a one man show in 2010 with mostly new material.  It is outstanding and if you are a Neil Young fan - this is a must for you.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Brandon Sanderson's gifts are wonderfully detailed and unique magical physics, and more importantly, wonderfully drawn characters and fully realized worlds. Even this novella offers a richly detailed world and characters to care about.
B008MZPVP4|5.0|I can help you find out. Do you own this album yet? You do? Great. You're not a wuss. If you don't, just DADT, you whining sow.
B008Q09K2U|5.0|I am a huge John Corey fan. Love the character and humor he brings to the books. This story takes place in a far away place no one wants to go to. Imagine John and Kate in a desert, with a bunch of guys on the hunt for the panther. A road paved with danger, from man and environment. Definitely no place for a lady, but Kate appears to cope well under the circumstances.  Of course where Kate goes, hubby goes, and he uses every moment to remind the reader of the dangerous situation they are faced with.<br />The one sad thing I find about Nelson DeMille books, is that I finish them too quickly and then have to wait so long for the next one!
B005PK553C|5.0|This was a great show.  I loved the actors who made this story line so believable.  The picture quality from streaming was perfect, no buffering - I couldn't tell I wasn't playing a DVD.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|if you want to order MP3 music on your android phone this works great.  I assume Amazon thinks so and I do too.
B002ZG980U|5.0|This is a great story that plays with the viewer's mind and blurs the line between reality and imagination. I would recommend this to fans of movies that question reality, such as the Matrix.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|large keys, easy to read and use.  What more could you want from a free Calculator.  four more words, OK
1401238580|3.0|The mask is cheap, but still makes a great costume. I was disappointed by the graphic novel, which I found disjointed and confusing. Very few of the characters seemed to be developed in depth, and some of the side plots seemed to be randomly tossed into the story as &#34;filler&#34;. In my opinion, Watchmen was much better than this graphic novel.
B00124OEBY|5.0|I love the music and most of the songs.  I use to listen to the music back in the late 60's and early 70's.  I like it then and I still do.
B001QTXM5Y|5.0|This is a long film, but definitely entertaining, with a great story and cast. I saw this before reading the graphic novel but was able to enjoy both. The director's cut adds a few scenes from the novel that were not present in the theatrical release. I would recommend this for fans of mystery/detectives and movies in general (not just superhero/comics movies).
0547884591|5.0|At this point I have read through most of this book and several parts more than once.  Like most GOOD books, a quick read through will wet your appetite. However, when you get down to reading the things more in depth, you see that the principles Tim is teaching are invaluable.<br /><br />I have been cooking for more than 10 years at home.  Like Tim I spent a lot of time in college watching the food network. I learned a lot from those chiefs and cooks, especially Alton Brown. Like Alton, Tim breaks things down into the basics, so that you can see how a few simple techniques can be used for multiple dishes.  My wife grew up baking, where recipes are paramount to success.  She use to hate cooking, because the recipes were so hard to follow. I never used recipes and it drove her nuts.  She was afraid to fail.  After several years she began to be able to construct food without recipes, because she had learned the basics that made cooking possible.  In the 4HC Tim can help anyone learn the same principles that can free you in the kitchen without having to figure them out yourself, in front of the TV.<br /><br />I also have enjoyed the Meta-Learning chapter, which is why I bought the book in the first place.  I like the idea of figuring out how to work through things and know what to tackle in order to better understand and learn them.  Asking questions is crucial to the quest and with the 4HC Tim helps you to know what questions to ask.  Overall the book is an entertaining read that if you are willing to spend the time and take the notes, will pay dividends anywhere you choose to apply the principles.
B002CPMB9O|5.0|This is a great story with superb performances by Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe. Although violent at times throughout, this is a great film.
B0000700KQ|5.0|Not a review of the film, instead this clue guide is the same basic idea as \\"David Lynch`s 10 Clues to Unlocking This Thriller\\" on the \\"Mulholland Dr.\\" DVD sleeve, but it provides enough information so that you can actually unlock (understand with crystal clarity) the plot of this movie without me or anyone else offering an explanation or interpretation.  Once you figure it out yourself, you'll know that you have it right beyond all doubt.<br /><br />It's necessary that I state at the outset who the movie is about and also mention some mostly incidental things about her when presenting the 16 clues to provide sufficient insight on the enigmatic way David Lynch tells the story cinematically (therefore, this won`t be absolutely spoiler-free, but essentially spoiler-free in terms of the plot).  In Clue #12 and especially in Clue #13, I provide a (for the most part) general description of the climax of \\"Mulholland Dr.\\" but without going into enough detail to spoil the visual/cinematic impact of it for people who haven`t seen the movie before (this general description of the climax is necessary so that first-time viewers won`t be confused by the highly unusual way David Lynch presents it).<br /><br />Please read the 16 clues below immediately before watching David Lynch's masterpiece, \\"Mulholland Dr.\\"  Also, you might find it helpful to copy and paste these clues into a word document, print it out, and have it handy as you're watching the movie.  Then, you can pause the movie as often as you like, see where you're at on the clue guide, and then resume watching the movie.<br /><br />The 16 Clues:<br /><br />1.)  Diane Selwyn.  The protagonist of \\"Mulholland Dr.\\" is Diane Selwyn (Naomi Watts).  From the very beginning to the very end, this movie is all about her.  This is determined in retrospect by Clue #3, Clue #6, Clue #10, and the last 30 minutes of the movie in general.<br /><br />2.)  The Jitterbug Contest/Opening Credits.  Diane wins a jitterbug dancing contest in her native Deep River, Ontario, Canada  which creates the opportunity for her to pursue her career ambitions in Los Angeles, California, USA.  This is determined in retrospect by what she says at a dinner party (Clue #10).<br /><br />3.)  The Bedroom.  Immediately following the jitterbug scene, but much later in her life, that's Diane heading to bed (make a mental note of the red sheets and pillowcases and the green blanket).  This becomes clear in retrospect (Clue #6).<br /><br />4.)  Diane's Dream.  As soon as her head hits the pillow, Diane's dream begins with someone riding in a limousine at night along Mulholland Drive in Hollywood, California (this dream lasts for about two hours).  Some people are skeptical about this being a dream segment because, when it was shown in the pilot episode of the television version of \\"Mulholland Dr.,\\" it wasn't presented as a dream.  While that's true, it doesn't change the fact that, in the movie, it's been repurposed as a dream.  It's like someone who built a restaurant later converting it into a nightclub.  Well, once the conversion is complete it's a nightclub because it's been repurposed to be one.  The dream segment is determined by comparing Clue #3 with Clue #6.<br /><br />5.)  The Story in the Dream Versus the Plot of the Movie.  The simple and unambiguous plot of \\"Mulholland Dr.\\" is revealed during the last 30 minutes of the movie, not in Diane's dream.  Though fascinating to watch and though it has some interesting parallels to her waking life, in the last analysis, Diane's dream is just a dream.  Therefore, conflating the story in the dream (based on subjective dream interpretation) with the plot of the movie (based on facts) results in unnecessary complexity and ambiguity.<br /><br />6.)  The Neighbor.  As Diane awakens to the sound of her neighbor knocking on her front door (which she began hearing unconsciously shortly before she woke up), notice the red sheets and pillowcases and the green blanket (see Clue #3).Aside from this scene establishing that Diane Selwyn is the dreamer, here are the three most important points to get from the neighbor's visit:  1.)  notice that the neighbor takes her ashtray from Diane's coffee table, 2.)  notice that there is a blue key sitting on the coffee table near where the ashtray was, and 3.)  make a mental note of the last thing the neighbor says to Diane just before she leaves (or if you think you might forget, pause the movie and write down the last thing the neighbor says before leaving).<br /><br />7.)  Diane Hallucinates Seeing Camilla.  After the neighbor leaves, when Diane sees Camilla Rhodes (Laura Harring) in the kitchen, she's hallucinating (Camilla is not really there).  This will become apparent in retrospect (Clue #13).<br /><br />8.)  Flashback.  While wearing a white bathrobe, Diane makes herself a cup of coffee and carries it to her living room.  When she gets to her couch, the scene abruptly changes to her wearing short blue jeans and nude from the waist up and carrying a glass (instead of a coffee cup) with some other type of beverage.  On her coffee table, the neighbor's ashtray is there and the blue key is missing.  This means that we have switched from Diane's present to her past (see Clue #6).  In this scene, Camilla is really there.<br /><br />9.)  The Flashback Sequence.  The plot of \\"Mulholland Dr.\\" is revealed during the last 30 minutes of the movie and most of this time is devoted to a series of flashbacks (starting with Clue #8).  Generally, the last half hour shows events from Diane's waking life that really happened (exceptions are noted, such as the hallucination in the kitchen).  To understand the plot, keep this in mind:  it's all about Diane Selwyn, Camilla Rhodes, Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux), and the unnamed man Diane meets with at the diner.  All you have to do is learn who these people are, the actions they take, and the impact those actions have on one another.  The narrative is easy to understand.<br /><br />10.)  Adam Kesher's Dinner Party on Mulholland Drive.  In my opinion, this is the most important scene of the movie and why the film bears its name.  At this dinner party, the conversation becomes significant as soon as everyone is inside the house (especially the dialogue between Diane and Coco, Adam`s mother).  There are two things that happen at this dinner party that particularly impact Diane (one regarding something Camilla does and one regarding an announcement that Adam makes just as this scene abruptly ends).  This pivotal dinner party scene more fully establishes the identities/backgrounds, personalities, character, and motivations of Diane, Camilla, and Adam.<br /><br />11.)  The Diner.  The final flashback scene (and, in my opinion, the second most important scene in the movie) occurs in a diner called Winkies on Sunset Blvd.  Having seen what happened at the dinner party, you'll understand who the unnamed man is Diane is meeting with and why she's meeting with him.  You'll also understand the significance of the blue key that you saw sitting on Diane's coffee table (Clue #6).<br /><br />12.)  Symbolic, Not Real.  The scene that immediately follows the diner scene is a cinematic device that signals Diane's impending descent into madness (Clue #13).  Although interesting to ponder, everything shown in this scene is not necessary to understand the plot of \\"Mulholland Dr.\\"<br /><br />13.)  Descent into Madness.  This scene returns us to Diane's present where we see her sitting on her couch while still wearing her white bathrobe.  The coffee cup we saw her carrying earlier is now sitting on her coffee table.  Notice that her neighbor's ashtray is gone and the blue key is sitting on the coffee table (Clue #6).  Diane stares obsessively at the blue key (Clue #11), fully realizing what it signifies.  Soon, as we hear the sound of someone knocking loudly on her front door (which Diane could be merely imagining due to her paranoia or someone could really be there possibly related to the last thing her neighbor said before leaving--Clue #6), Diane`s mounting guilt and fear get the better of her.  Because of the serious consequences of her action at the diner, she suffers a psychotic breakdown, which we see from her mental perspective. According to an online medical dictionary, (paraphrasing) people suffering from psychosis are unable to distinguish personal subjective experience from the reality of the external world. They experience hallucinations and/or delusions that they believe are real and may behave erratically.  That description fits this scene to a tee.<br /><br />14.)  Another Symbolic Scene.  This brief, symbolic scene features one of the figures we saw in the last such scene.<br /><br />15.)  Two Lovers.  Kind of an epilogue, this brief, poignant scene (either a flashback or symbolic) shows a happy time during the lives of two very familiar people who were once lovers.<br /><br />16.)  The Silencio Nightclub.  The final scene.  \\"Silencio\\" means \\"silence\\" in Spanish.<br /><br />In my opinion, \\"Mulholland Dr.\\" is David Lynch's greatest film and one of my personal favorite movies of all time.
1401232590|5.0|I really enjoyed this graphic novel. The idea of the Holiday Killer was good, and this was a great detective/mystery story where Batman and others worked to identify the Holiday Killer.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|This new Angry Birds is almost a new game! You need to learn shooting, electricity, sonic waves, etc. Fun Star Wars theme with cool theme birds like r2-d2 and backgrounds from original movies. I love it!
0930289234|5.0|I saw the movie for this first, but I loved the graphic novel as well. There are a wide range of characters/personalities, and these are developed in great detail. The story is intriguing and forces the reader to ask some personal questions with regard to their own beliefs. I would recommend this for anyone who is a fan of literature (not just graphic novels).
B004X4R49Y|5.0|The movie is slow, but exceptionally acted.  It is an interesting movie with depth.  I was particularly touched by the King's fear and lack of self-confidence given his station.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|It's about time Indy arrives on Blu Ray! The conversion is astonishing. That's the main draw of this set. I've owned the films on VHS, DVD, and seen them on television countless times. This is the best they've ever looked. Bonus features are great, menus are inspired. Overall, a great collection.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|If you liked Iron Man, Captain America, Iron Man 2 etc.. then this is a great movie.  if you don't like watching your favorite comic characters come to life, then you may not like it.
B00009UW0N|5.0|The Divimax release of Halloween by Anchor Bay to me, is the release of Halloween. The bonus content is excellent, the commentaries are great, and the quality of the film's image is excellent. It amazes me that even the film clearly looks dated, how well it plays. I got to see a digital projection of the blu ray in theaters in October and it was still as great as the first time I saw it.
B004EPZ07U|3.0|okay movie ultra violet waste of time, will not buy another dvd with it, will not make mistake again in future
B008IGP8LY|3.0|This score is definitely not the most memorable in the series, to me, that would have to go to Batman Begins. I feel that from top to bottom, that score plays well. However, it should be noted that he shared scoring duties on that film with the great James Newton Howard. This movie features a lot of synthesized sounds and uses less of the orchestra, whereas the last two films still relied on a very symphonic feel to act as the soul of the score. Here, it seems to be Zimmer's ethereal synthesizers that he's been turning to so often as of late. He does use them quite brilliantly though during the end credits track played in the film. Also, the somber, slow and foreboding theme for both Bane and Miranda Tate make up my favorite part of the score.<br /><br />It does however, offer one of the most memorable cues in the history of Batman, Bane's theme, which can be heard spread in Gotham's Reckoning, track 3. If you're a Zimmer fan like me, you need to own this because you probably have the scores to both Batman Begins, and the Dark Knight. Even though it's not as strong as it's predecessors, I still felt it was good enough to buy on both CD and vinyl, something I wish I would have done for both Inception and The Dark Knight.
0345522478|4.0|Not big on character development but an easy fun read. I'd say its the fantasy equivalent of a Dan brown book...the same pace as the Divinc Code
B0086700CM|5.0|I think it is the best game ever! some people say that subway suffers are better but not for me.
B0021L8V1Q|4.0|Although this film isn't as exciting as the first one, I still can't help but enjoy it. I'm not a fan of changing cast members in the middle of a series, which they did here for one reason or another, but overall the film was definitely a good part that leads to the future films (more Iron Man films, the Avengers, and who knows what else).<br /><br />Overall, a good movie and I recommend it as part of the Marvel movie franchise to own and watch.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham seems to always produce a good read and makes you a part of the ride.Highly enjoyable and recommend to all.
B00701L5XS|4.0|It's a neat app which does exactly what one may expect. It contains diagrams that show how to produce different knots. It needs to be a bit more polished up for my taste (hence the 4 stars), but overall, worth it if you want to learn about knots.
1881273377|5.0|This information is probably the best practical approach to understanding the problems with relationships yet offered.<br />Someone told me a long time ago...&#34;people do things for their own reasons&#34;...this information causes you to look practically and take the time to investigate how your spouse or girlfriend may be seeing things from her perspective...until you at least become aware of this fact of life, you'll never really understand why others do what they do....great stuff...I listen to it over and over again as I travel in my business activities...it can apply to any relationship....even your relationship with God.
B000PC0U1W|5.0|This was a very enjoyable movie, and I keep coming back over and over to watch it. I have thoroughly enjoyed not only the dialogue, but the overall tone of unity in the movie. I highly recommend it.
B007TK77QE|1.0|It didn't work for me. A had to give up reading this book after approximately 100 pages. I got lost in the mixture of characters and the plot didn't capture me.
B004G6009K|5.0|Disney does it again with its masterful way of bringing a good story with good songs, creative actors, and alluring visuals. It's a good and moving story for all ages.
0465068359|5.0|Very Good Book. Never liked to many books, but this book keeps your interest and I had to have the book for a history research report.
B004JMSIRC|5.0|This movie blew me away. I really enjoyed the engineering, thinking, and trial and error shown. It really showed the humanity of Tony Stark, which was great to see. Despite him being a genius engineer, it showed the importance of failure in the overall progress of the big picture.<br /><br />This is a great movie to own and watch over and over.
B00005JK8K|4.0|In the war in the Pacific, the American soldiers needed a code that the Japanese could not break. They turned to the Navajo. Sgt. Enders is assigned the task of protecting Navajo soldier, Ben Yahzee. This is no easy task. He has to stay alive himself in order to protect his new friend. This is a dramatic and amazing true story of honor, friendship and loyalty.<br /><br />This movie is amazing. I'm not a Nicolas Cage fan or anything, but he does a good job. So does Adam Beach. The action, drama, suspense and cinematography are all top notch. This film is a must see.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|At the time of writing this, I have not seen the third installment of the trilogy (Dark Knight Rises), but this is such a great movie. The late Heath Ledger performed at his very best in this film and it's one of my favorite batman films ever (along with the Michael Keaton films). It's very compelling.
B000096I9G|5.0|This is an excellent concert. The live versions of these songs are way better than the studio album versions. If you are a Cure fan, or just a casual listener, this concert will blow you away.
B001BN1ZHW|5.0|I really enjoyed this film. The songs are great and this is quite an interesting rendition of the original musical/play. Everyone does a brilliant job at bringing the feeling of the story to life in this rendition. The songs are memorable (though sadly the original opening song was cut), and the cast is excellent.
B000A6T1JU|3.0|The Warriors are a gang of thugs from Coney Island. They are led to a meeting with all the major gangs. It turns out to be an ambush. Now they must fight their way back to Coney Island. Through alleys, parks, subways, and under bridges. No matter where they go, someone is out to get them.<br /><br />This movie has some pretty good action and some parts that I thought were funny. Even though the movie was well written, and directed, I just can't get into a story about a bunch of street punks beating each other up for no good reason. If you someone is fighting for something important like family or country, I can get into that. This movie is just about thugs, and I really just don't care. I'll give the screenplay and directing 5 stars, but the subject matter 1 star. That's an average of 3.
B000WQWPKA|5.0|This movie is so well made. In a time when CGI (computer generated images) was still semi-modern and sort of new (only been around a decade or so), this brings together a good mix of using scale models and CGI. I love watching this movie at least once a year (especially with a big screen and surround sound).
1451695195|3.0|I found the book a little disappointing.  I wish the author told more details of his time spent in heaven. He spent quite a bit of time on his family history.  That was nice, but he could have shortened this information by many many pages.  Also, the scientific information included in the text was very technical. Persons in the medical profession will probably find this interesting, but it was too much for me.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|This film is, after all, the Sound of Music! Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer take the screen on one of their best performances in this memorable classic! The blu-ray quality is superb. And the things it comes with are great for those who would want them (the music box for example). A great buy.
B00AE2J5HI|2.0|As a period action/outlaw film, this could have been 4 stars - driven largely by the performances of Tom Hardy and Guy Pearce.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the screenwriters who adapted the book found it necessary to include two love stories into the thing, which added nothing to the plot and exerted a profound drag upon the pacing of the film.  I guess the film makers felt obliged to do this in order to create a \\"date movie\\" for female audiences, but they spent so much time on the romantic subplots that the action heart of the film got lost.<br /><br />The really interesting love story here was the love of Guy Pearce's character for himself.  What a terrific, risk-taking, under-appreciated actor he is.
B004EPZ03Y|5.0|I really enjoyed the newest addition to the Muppets movie collection. It's so well done. I enjoyed the story, the acting, the song/dance numbers, and of course the tips of the hat (references) to older Muppets movies. Well done Disney.
B00A7CI82I|5.0|I have always liked this series. I mean come on, government experiments, secrets, spies, traitors, cover-ups, death, destruction and mayhem, what's not to like. I really like how they merged, in part, Ultimatum with this one. Gives you a time line to start with and then takes off from there. Rather well done. Jeremy and Rachel are the perfect people for the parts. The gradual progression of the experiments from pure physc to DNA re-sequencing, is rather frightning, especially when, Lorax, is said to be &#34;without the side effects&#34;. Ya, like we haven't heard that before. No matter what, this movies grab's you from the first to the last. Don't worry about the popcorn, you'll never have time to enjoy it. Too much going on.
B003VS0CXI|5.0|I really enjoy this classic movie. People of all ages can get together to watch it, and even sing along with it. Highly recommended!
1400067820|5.0|Taleb captures an important idea about things that get better with use (within range), and gives it a name. The idea that the older something is (the wheel), the longer it is expected to be around goes head on with the idea the the new (Facebook) will dominate the future. The lack of a editor is obvious and distracting, but the rawness of the book makes it tolerable.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|I really do enjoy how Steve Rogers is portrayed from beginning to end as a true hero. With this movie, there's no wonder why he became the first Avenger. This is great to watch and re-watch. It's very entertaining, and comes highly recommended.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|It would be foolish for me to add to the mountain of praise Series 1 and 2 has already garnered internationally, so I will limit myself to the technical aspect ... it is also superb.  The picture and sound are stunningly beautiful and ... sorry, I can't resist mentioning this ... never more so than in the proposal scene in swirling snow outside Downton Abbey, which is about as romantic a scene as one could wish for and ranks right up there along with Elizabeth (Jennifer Ehle) and Mr. Darcy (Colin Firth) touring Pemberly in the classic BBC Production of 'Pride and Prejudice'.  I'm happy I elected to purchase the original UK edition with its 'Christmas Special'.  One might cavil about the almost total lack of liner notes but I'm sure any questions one could have about the making of 'Downton Abbey', etc., are answered in the excellent bonus features. I look forward to Series 3.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I first saw it in the cinema in 3D and while I didn't buy the 3D version of the blu-ray, I still enjoyed the film a lot. It's quite entertaining and I come back to watch it over and over. They do a good job of presenting the characters individually, so that even if you've not seen the previous films, you can still enjoy it. Well done!
B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|Celine Dion is a fabulous, extraordinary performer. I am very happy her Live in Las Vegas show is available with this disk set. Celine is totally awesome and a wonderful person. She sure can sing! This set has quite a few of her top hits. Very nice!
B009Z8FUB2|5.0|Such a fantastic film in the ways it re-envisioned the novel, but I was even more taken by the score. Lovely music. It will carry you away.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I was excited to learn that not only could I get a Pony app but it was also free so I rushed to find it. I'm extremely pleased with the level of detail that went into the game, from the ponies' interactions and movements to the voices that are right from the show. The mini games are simple yet fun, targetting the show' s audience perfectly and getting the ponies to max level is pretty quick. There are in game rewards for playing daily which help to build up to buy more expensive things. Overall I am addicted and can't wait to see which quest is next! Great job, Hasbro!
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I have seen this movie twice and will watch it again. The characters are really colorful, I love the plot and, and it gives the viewer an insight to a time when things were quite different from how they are now.
B0053O89XI|5.0|Very funny! Can't wait for next season. The creators keep the laughs coming in this new season and it leaves so much room to expand in next season.
B0067QPVJ6|3.0|It's an ok movie. Not really my kind of genre, but I know my son will enjoy it. He's the one I bought it for and that's what counts.
0756407125|5.0|Once in a rare while, stories come along that sweep you off of your feet, they draw you into your own world, however you may see it.  These novels are a rare treat.  When Kvothe meets Felurian, and the words that follow are drawn on the page and interpreted in your mind, it is a wonderful thing.  I am envious of those who get to read these novels for the first time.  I will be reading them over and over again until I am no longer around to read, because I have gained a bunch of new, close friends, you see, and I want to visit them every now and again, over and over again.  These are once in a lifetime books, for any genre, and I beg you to treat your imagination.  Thank you, Patrick Rothfuss.
B00887490Y|4.0|I enjoyed this movie and will watch it again. Very well done with interesting plot twist. Great for giving as a gift.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Christopher Nolan has concluded his Batman series in great style with TDKR. With the impossible task of trying to match its predecessor The Dark Knight Rises is a fitting climax to Nolan's vision of the Dark Knight
B0070Y46UY|2.0|Because of the animal cruelty , book should not be purchased or movie should not be seen - Tiger is beautiful but cruelty is horrible - not for children or any age
B003QSOFFO|5.0|A must for the family library.  Entertainment and history are combined in this animated classic.  My whole family enjoyed it, both old and young.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Not only is it a great human story but also you will learn a lot about the different points of view of those who lived through WW11.  Very interesting and educational.
B0069UP2PI|5.0|I love this movie, and so I ordered it to watch when I want.  It certainly makes you wonder just what it takes for a contagion to spread.  Excellent movie for those that find Virus's, and plaques fascinating.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|That's just the way it was growing up.  One of the best movies I've ever seen.  See if you don't agree.
0547884591|5.0|Tim Ferriss (verb) - (1) to break down a subject in the most succinct, interesting, and entertain way possible.<br />(2) to succeed or excel in a given field with minimal effort and maximum style.<br /><br />Example: \\"I used to suck at __{insert any skill}__, but then I pulled a Tim Ferriss.  Now people pay me money to teach them {insert aforementioned skill}.  And I'm rich.  And better looking.  And can dunk on a 12 foot rim.\\"<br /><br />For anyone who's read 4HB and/or 4HWW, 4HC is right on par with either of the previous two, but with more color and pictures. What's not to like?<br /><br />For anyone who is new to Tim's work, if you're in the market for becoming better at life without spending thousands of $ and wasting even more time, I highly recommend The Four Hour Chef.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great show, a lot of twists and turns. Always keeps you on your toes. Found myself yelling at the TV more then once.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I just started to get into photography and I needed a bag to hold all my stuff. I obviously knew I had to spend a lot of money on an expensive bag to store and protect my $1000 camera. I was wrong. I paid a lot less and still got what i needed. This bag is perfect! Definitely worth getting!
B0067AC5KA|5.0|This book rocked!!! I saw the movie &#34;girl with the dragon tatto&#34; & the book was much better, the rest of the trilogy was super. Sorry that Mr Larssson is no longer with us (RIP) as I would of like to read more books by him. Do you know if he has more books? if so please let me know the name of his books.
034580404X|4.0|I don't know what I can possibly say about this trilogy that hasn't already been said. It's interesting, to say the least! I tell my friends to make sure they are alone when they read it! LOL!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|My daughter reqessted a copy for Christmas, so I know this film will appeal to younger audiences also.  It's wonderful.
B002NC8JEC|5.0|This is such a nice holiday CD. I play it in my truck everywhere I go around the holidays. I so enjoy hearing them when they were so young. I like the way they all got the chance to send their own holiday wishes individually. When Michael sings &#34;Little Christmas Tree&#34; I get goosebumps! Beautiful song!

B004HD2ZIQ|4.0|Album number 20 (yes, you read that right: 20!) differs from the other nineteen in that Motorhead opt for a more traditional hard rock approach than a heavy metal one. (Frontman Lemmy Kilmeister has always insisted that MH are a hard rock band, and on 2010's \\"The World Is Yours,\\" he makes a pretty strong case for that fact.)<br /><br />Like any record from this iconic English power trio, this is a very solid one. As such, whether a hard rock or a heavy metal band, Motorhead are one of the most consistent music groups on the market. Sure, \\"The World Is Yours\\" might not reinvent the Motorhead wheel, but it is full of the usual thrill-a-minute goodies: Crunchy guitar riffs, fat bass riffs, excellent solos, bluesy grooves, tight speed punk drum beats, and catchy-as-hell vocals. Therefore, this album does rock mightily hard, make for an extremely enjoyable listen, and leave a very favorable and memorable overall impression.<br /><br />Opener \\"Born To Lose\\" (I know, it's hard to believe that Lemmy hasn't already used that song title!) plays like a cut of full-on speed punk, with its powerful guitar-driven rhythms, booming bass bottom, and really loud, searing, wildly shredding guitar solo. \\"I Know How To Die\\" is a rollicking, propulsive, hard-rocking number with more ripping and wailing solos. Both of these tracks are almost overshadowed, however, by the pyrotechnic soloing and anthemic choruses of \\"Get Back In Line.\\" \\"Devils In My Head\\" is a piece of punk metal with hefty, chunky, chugging riffs, steady, humming bass lines, and the guitarist (Phil Campbell) ripping out fiery solos. \\"Rock And Roll Music\\" is a steady, feel-good hard rocker with really memorable choruses, shredding solo runs, and AC-DC-esque lyricism (i.e. lines like \\"rock and roll is a true religion\\" abound, here).<br /><br />That was the first five songs, now the other five. \\"Waiting For The Snake\\" has a thunderous, underlying bass groove driving the number, although some fiery guitar licks do help with this matter, as well. \\"Brotherhood Of Man\\" is a thunderous track with an ominous, brooding main groove, distorted, grumbling bass lines, and abnormally low, growly vocals. \\"I Know What You Need\\" is kind of like the sister-song to \\"Brotherhood\\" in that it is backed by heavy, throbbing bass lines, a muscular groove, and a fiery, shredding solo.) \\"Outlaw,\\" which is sandwiched in between \\"Brotherhood Of Man\\" and \\"I Know What You Need,\\" features fiery speed metal riffs and muscularly pounding double-kick drumming. Another blistering guitar solo rips the air, here, too. Lastly but far from leastly, the set closes with \\"Bye Bye B Bye Bye\\" a rambunctious piece of speed metal/near thrash. It is highlighted by blistering tempos, and some of the album's absolute best guitar soloing (one of which is careening and whammy-bar drenched; the other is wailing and air-guitar-able.)<br /><br />Admittedly, \\"The World Is Yours\\" does lack the punch, innovation, and timelessness that previous classics such as \\"Ace Of Spades\\" and \\"Orgasmatron\\" had. It is a good album, just not a great one. But is it still worth buying? Oh yeah, I would definitely say so! After all, it's friggin' Motorhead...so what else do you need to know?!his matter, as well. \\"Brotherhood Of Man\\" is a thunderous track with an ominous, brooding main groove, distorted, grumbling bass lines, and abnormally low, growly vocals. \\"I Know What You Need\\" is kind of like the sister-song to \\"Brotherhood\\" in that it is backed by heavy, throbbing bass lines, a muscular groove, and a fiery, shredding solo.) \\"Outlaw,\\" which is sandwiched in between \\"Brotherhood Of Man\\" and \\"I Know What You Need,\\" features fiery speed metal riffs and muscularly pounding double-kick drumming.

B0086700CM|5.0|My daughter and my niece love this game, my niece plays it for hours keeps her entertained and out of my sisters and mothers hair.
B000001ESF|5.0|A few albums inevitably come to mind when you hear the words \\"progressive metal.\\" Like Queensryche's \\"Operation Mindcrime,\\" King Crimson's \\"Discipline,\\" and Dream Theater's \\"Images And Words.\\" But Rush's fourth album, 1976's \\"2112,\\" should also, most definitely, be considered one of those albums. This record is not only Rush's breakthrough and watershed release, it, to this very day, remains their finest hour. Instead of choosing between either prog rock or heavy rock/metal (which is what the band had done up until this point), \\"2112\\" has both. Add some complex, conceptual storytelling to the mix of melodic vocals, inventive guitar work, and unorthodox song structures, and the end result is six unique, original, monstrously influential, and gloriously shining examples of how progressive rock/metal should be done.<br /><br />\\"2112/Overture/The Temples Of Syrinx/Discovery/Presentation/The Oracle\\" is an epically epic album opener, and a twenty-plus-minute lesson in prog rock/metal excess. This monstrous, whopper lead-off track masterfully mixes together spacey, proggy synths and heavy, bobbing, horn-like guitar hooks, and the whole thing is anchored by a strong, g rumbling bass tone. Then a twenty-second-or-so long guitar solo crops up, as does a beautiful acoustic break. And just when it looks like it is going to be a completely instrumental song, Geddy Lee's clean vocals -- which are reminiscent of Ozzy Osbourne, Robert Plant, and Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson -- come onto the scene around four-and-a-half minutes in. Some more totally wailing and air-guitar-able soloing pops up some time later, as do a couple of slow tempo changes and near silent breakdowns. But Alex Lifeson's power chords come thundering back in, as does another shredding, ascending and descending solo. This is then followed-up by Neil Peart showcasing his exceptional dexterity with some really deft and rolling drum fills. And Peart is accompanied by some propulsive, Led Zeppelin-esque riffs, and some distinctly Rush-esque -- and mightily catchy -- swing and grooves. And the song caps off with one final guitar solo -- only this solo sounds less like a guitar solo, and more like a synth or even a harmonica.<br /><br />This title track is immediately followed-up by \\"A Passage To Bangkok,\\" a much more palatable and commercially-accessible number, and a terrifically, classically catchy lead single. It is an extremely infectious tune, and one that features a shred-happy guitar solo and eminently memorable, concert-ready choruses. Moving right along, \\"The Twilight Zone\\" begins with some dreamy, proggy strings before a piercing, ripping solo comes screaming in, thus taking the song into heavier territory. \\"Lessons\\" continues in this heavy vein, as it just might darn well be the heaviest song on the whole record. It is a bass-heavy track, as it is backed by some prominently audible, heavy, grumbling bass lines; and is further highlighted by some more propulsive guitar shredding. \\"Lessons\\" is immediately offset, however, by \\"Tears,\\" a terrifically proggy, strings and all ballad with orchestral-sounding synth and piano lines. And in a very Zeppelin-like move, some mellotron playing is also fused into the mix, here. \\"Something For Nothing\\" wraps it all up in suitably hard-rocking fashion, with still more driving, downtuned bass lines, bobbing guitar hooks, and excellent solos. And all the while, Lee's signature hair metal-lite vocals soar on top of the mix and wail away without end.<br /><br />\\"2112\\" is a virtual handbook for progressive metal etiquette. Therefore, if you are new to either the band or the genre, you might as well start right here.distinctly Rush-esque -- and mightily catchy -- swing and grooves.

B00A77II0U|5.0|This is by far one of the best games I've played...I really don't want it to end. I certainly hope there's another one on the way!
B004DLPXAO|4.0|When it comes to apps like this, I'm just happy if they work.  I have several devices with the Kindle apps,  (along with the Kindle).  It's nice to be able to read my books wherever in the world I happen to be.
B008Z9L94O|3.0|Just got through my first listen of the entire album.<br /><br />1)  Packaging; amazing.  Awesome art, solid, large casing, and two really great extra books filled with lyrics, stories, etc.  The price definitely shows in these flawless extras.<br /><br />2)  The Vinyl; pretty darn good save for the abysmal mix of Zero.  It's unlistenable.  Truly a horrible overcook.  Maybe the 2nd press will fix the problem.<br /><br />Overall, I have to give this only three stars for the disaster that is Zero.
B009OYSFDM|4.0|Good first season.  Good but it starting to get predictable in the story lines.! ! ! ! ! ! !
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|very enjoyable its a good pick will keep u entertained for awhile good graphics if u like these types of games worth the buy
B009329ZF2|3.0|A bit hokey and forced with the 'romantic' sideline, but solid action and lots of noise and explosions for the boys.
B003DTMUOE|5.0|Really is the second time I reading this book, I have the hard copy and now I have the electronic Book is the best book from this century. Really, really I recommended for every body.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|I was going to purchase this game for my kindle fire (1st generation) but it showed up as a free app of the day.  I was excited and got it right away.  The graphics are excellent.  There are no hints available but the game is not that difficult to figure out.  It is short, I finished it in one day.  It would have been worth the 99c if I had to purchase it.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I  Have been a Vince Flynn fan since he began publishing.  Love his main character, hope he never changes him.
B004ZGI1V0|4.0|The movie reminded me of Frantic,another movie I enjoyed. The movie is Hitchcockian and kept me guessing most of the way. The behavior of one of the main characters seems unnatural, but overall a very good movie. One, I'll watch again after a few months.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I bought this book on a friend's recommendation.  I really like that the book gave you background of the author.  The book is thought provoking and a pretty fast read.  After I finished it, I though about a lot of the things that the author wrote about.  I would recommend this book for people who have had a near death experience.  The fact that the author is a medical doctor and went through a nearly fatal disease and came through, is remarkably astounding.  I have it on my kindle and will reread it again.
030758836X|1.0|I had to read this for my book club. At first it seemed like a decent enough book. But then it turned into something like a bad 1980's soap opera in terms of plot (think &#34;Dallas&#34; or &#34;Knot's Landing&#34;). What a waste of time.
1609611543|5.0|i stumbled upon this book on the internet while looking for another crash diet, and i'm so glad i did. i had pretty much all the symptoms everyone else is complaining about: IBS, allergies, indigestion, brain fog, knee and hip pains, skin problems, sleep problems, PMS, migraines, anxiety, panic attacks, and lately chest pains after eating a big meal. and to top it all off i'm about 80 lbs overweight and i was told by my GP a couple of years ago that my cholesterol was high. i chose not to take any statins at the time since my BP was normal, i have a family history of high cholesterol and i kept telling myself that i will lose the weight and fix the problem. i've been on every diet out there, lost 40 lbs on Atkins and gained it right back in less than 2 months. i had uncontrollable cravings and night binges. i felt pretty much out of control.<br />after reading this book a month ago, i cleaned my pantry and fridge of any wheat sources right away and proceeded to eat wheat free foods. my husband, who is a diabetic, also decided to give it a try. i thought i was gonna have such a hard time, i was expecting withdrawals and headaches, but after the first couple of days i started feeling better. i lost a total of 21 lbs to date and most of my symptoms are gone, IBS improved 80%, no more knee/hip pain, and i haven't taken allergy pills or pain killers in a month, which was unheard of for me especially at this time of the year. i'm finally sleeping without the help of a sleeping aid and i have so much more energy during the day.<br />my husband stopped taking his short acting diabetes med after a couple of hypoglycemic events. now he only takes his long acting med and his BG's are normal, he checks them regularly. he didn't have much weight to lose, but he lost his gut and now, after only 1 month, he is back at the weight he was 13 years ago when we got married. he looks younger to me and he tells me he feels great all the time now. he certainly has more energy and sleeps alot less during the day, he used to come home from work and crash on the couch all the time. now, we do stuff on the weekends, before he would nap all the time on his days off.<br />this book has been an answer to my prayers and after all these improvements, we decided to stay wheat free for life. thank God for dr. Davis and his book recommendations, it has changed our lives!<br />i can't wait until my husband's next doctor appointment, i'm hoping that he'll be able to get off the statins and hopefully improve his thyroid levels. we are looking forward to better lives and hopefully we'll start exercising soon when the weather gets better.

B0041KVW2K|4.0|There's been a lot written here about this latest Beatles remastered set, so I thought I would offer my opinion and musings having just received my copy on a lovely early summer's day here in Australia.<br /><br />Firstly my background: I was born almost to the day that Paul announced he was \\"quitting\\" the Beatles (as if he ever could!). I've been buying and listening to vinyl (and the Beatles) for over 30 years now. I have what I suppose could be described as lower-mid-range audio equipment.<br /><br />Packaging seems to have been a big problem for many buyers here, and I admit to having suffered previously with poorly packaged vinyl from Amazon. Thankfully on this occasion my records were well-packed with sturdy foam top and bottom and plenty of breathing room. The outer box and all contents are visibly in top condition. It's worth noting that the shipping box did *not* have Amazon markings but seems to have come direct from Germany. Question to whoever can answer it: does this mean my set was not pressed in the US? I'd be interested to hear from anyone who can answer this, please leave a comment.<br /><br />As to any problems with the discs (discussed in great length previously here), I read carefully a number of the lower scoring reviews and was quick to check my copies of Abbey Road and Sgt Pepper first off. I was relieved to hear that Abbey Road played fine. Sgt Pepper played well in general but the vinyl had a strange \\"mottled\\" texture that was clearly visible over the entire disc. It's difficult to describe but the effect is kind of like when looking through stained glass. To my ears this did not affect playback. (None of the other discs suffered from this strange appearance.) The final chord of A Day in the Life suffered from some distortion, as did the inner groove which was awfully bad. I'm willing to concede that these could be owing to poor alignment and setup of my turntable, aging stylus etc. In any case I can live a full and happy life without ever again hearing the Sgt Pepper inner groove. Both discs had very slight issues with off-centre pressing, manifested in visible lateral movement of the tone arm during play.<br /><br />A few other minor issues:<br /><br />Help! has a visible mark on side 1 tracks 1-2 which is slightly audible as a tick during the gap between songs. Magical Mystery Tour has a visible minor edge warp which thankfully does not affect play to my ears. Baby You're a Rich Man is credited on the label to George Harrison! Really, get someone who has a brain to check the labels before printing, this sort of mistake is minor but so easily avoided. I am yet to listen closely to most of the discs but have examined them under light and can find no visible problems with warping, off-centre labels, scratches, non-fill etc. I was glad to see that some thought has gone into the design of the labels which were suggestive of (but certainly not identical to) the original UK pressings.<br /><br />In short, I consider myself to have gotten off extremely lightly compared to the poor Beatles fans who received records that were essentially unplayable. It's very sad that the powers that be were not able to provide to Beatles fans worldwide a high-quality product worth the wait of many years. I can not help but compare this release with recent vinyl offerings from Led Zeppelin, whose vinyl output of late has been outstanding in my opinion - clearly with quality the key at every stage. Sadly that seems to have not been the case with this most looked-forward-to of Beatles vinyl issues.<br /><br />Are our expectations too high when it comes to the quality that we expect? I would say for $300+ the answer is no - Beatles fans deserve better than shoddy pressings and poor packing. I must add, however, that my personal opinion is that for anyone seeking the ultimate Beatles listening experience you will always be going back to the original UK (mostly mono) pressings. This is *how the Beatles wanted it to sound*. I doubtnow that we will ever see an improvement - on vinyl at least - given that EMI seem reluctant to re-visit the analog master tapes.<br /><br />I've given this set 4 stars. I subtract a star for the problems described above and out of sympathy for less fortunate buyers. These records will certainly be my \\"go to\\" discs for casual Beatles listening from now on. Hopefully I'll live long enough to play the hell out of 'em.
B006L9B6TI|4.0|I enjoyed the book and look forward to rereading. The steps to gratitude were exciting to do and I appreciated it.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|This franchise never fully recovered from MIBII. While this, the third installment, is better than its most recent predecessor, that's not saying much. It's still light years from the original. Frankly, we would have skipped it knowing what we do now.
B003XDUCIG|5.0|The recipes are good and the interviews are a wonderful addition.  The best thing is it adds humor to teach.  It shows you the science of cooking rather than just follow the steps.  I think showing you why you should do this before that or why you can't just arbitrarily change the recipe for cookies is what makes it so great.
0679746048|5.0|I've been a fan of the movie based off of this for a long time, so I had been meaning to for basically ever been trying to get a hold of the book. Because the book is normally, almost always better. And basically I just wanted the real story, not the dramatized version. And this book didn't disappoint, though I'm kinda disappointed now by the movie because of all the things they changed and some parts that showed more BPD symptoms in the book that were left out of the film.<br />I think it's a great read, if you like this kind of book.
B000002H38|5.0|Whitney Houston burst on the pop music scene back in '85 and created a paradigm that many would emulate.  Celine Dion, Mariah Carey, Houston and others are/were gifted vocalists with pipes capable of multiple octaves.  Their music, however, was generic.  That's not to say it was bad.  It wasn't.  After a while it all started to sound the same!  These singer played it safe (no doubt) for commercial reasons and were difficult to take too seriously.<br /><br />Sade followed her own path and offered a refreshing change to this pervasive formula.<br /><br />Every once in a while a new artist comes along and changes all the rules!  Meet Anita Baker.  This CD is incredible!  Some have dubbed this style of music \\"quiet storm.\\"  Whatever!  Call it what you want, but you better give this one a good listen.  Baker sings with incredible passion and emotion here; something the aforementioned vocalists (Sade not included) never could pull off.<br /><br />Sweet Love, Rapture, Same Ole Love and Watch Your Step are more than just standard radio fare only because Baker sings them.  You Bring Me Joy and Been So Long make this a five star CD.  Baker's soaring, passionate vocals will leave you filled with goose bumps.<br /><br />The jazzy blend here is comprised of R&B and pop music.  Buy it!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John Green is never a disappointment. I like the way he was able to have me so incredibly sad and then drag a laugh out of me. He has a talent for words that seep into your soul and stay with you. I recommend it for sure.

B000FGGE7C|1.0|About 20 minutes into this film, you will wonder if it has any intention of slowing down from the continuous chase scene.  Then it does and you realize how bad it gets without the action.  You want to stick your leg over from the passenger seat and step on the accelerator yourself.<br /><br />Perhaps the highest praise I can muster for this film is how carefully it metered it's sucking while providing a wide variety to the sucking.

B008AK8FHM|3.0|Not the best writing, but ,certainly an interesting account. I do wonder how the author could have recalled so much of what was happening on the &#34;outside&#34; when he was in that &#34;other&#34; state of consciousness.
B0060D15AK|5.0|AWESOME!!!!! Betty White is a total blast!! It is a must see. It is funny and a movie that I feel everyone would enjoy.

075669812X|5.0|Purchased as a Christmas Gift for eight old son who loves ninjago and loves to read. I think he will love it; can't wait to see his face Christmas morning.
B0086700CM|5.0|Perfect game to play when you have a few minutes spare time. Only problem is I never know when to stop playing! Simple fun and a great model for what free games should be like.
B000A6T1JU|5.0|I have loved this movie since I first saw it a long time ago. Seeing as it's not easy to find on tv I decided to purchase it. I'm glad I did, the movie is still great today!
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|I saw this movie first in theaters, then twice at home. The story line and acting are very entertaining. I didn't hesitate to add this one to my shelf.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|When I finished the 50 shades books, I went looking for similar books. This series is what I found, and boy am I glad I did. Love these. Thank you. And can not wait for more... :)
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Lots of zombies, action and character building! Great come back from a slower season 2. Best season they've had so far.
034580404X|5.0|I've you saw the movie \\"Pretty Woman\\" than you would know that Edward is a rich bank investor who like Christian sells part of companies and makes billions. He pays Vivian, a prostitute, to spend a week with him. Christian offers Ana a contract at first. In the beginning they establish their hard limit - 50 Shades lingo- which is kissing on the mouth. As their romance develops interesting details about the characters are brought to light. Both Edward and Christian spent several hours (years really) in therapy as a result of parent's failures. They also both used the piano as their mode of catharsis. Both couples have an infamous sex scene on a baby grand piano. Vivian was less naive and experience than Ana was. Ana was a virgin when she met Christian. Neither women were accustomed to wealth. Both men flew their women for a night of entertainment on their jets. The women too were able to penetrate a deep emotional part of the men: Edward shared his fears and showed moments of vulnerability. Christian was able to mustered up the strength to let Ana touch his chest. Vivian mustered the strength to kiss Edward while he was sleeping. When the men crossed the line - Christian barbaric whipping, Edward sharing her profession (prostitute) with his close friend- they weren't afraid to walk out the door for good. But like all romance novels or movies, there are second chances. And who can forget? Both women wanted the fantasy most girls dream of: night and shining armor, flowers and candy. The men, wanting to be their hero, their everything, didn't cease to make their woman's dream come true. And the men didn't hesitate to fight for them either: Edward \\"friend\\" solicited Vivian for sex and when she declined he pushed himself in her, punched her and Edward came in afterward and punched him. Ana in the other hand had a handful of men (Ana's ex-boss) and women (Christian's Dominator, and his ex- submissive Leila) wanting her head in a plate. Minus the bruises, everything workedout in the couples favor.
B007EECSFA|3.0|Typical British fiction, slow moving and mostly dull.  If you need to put yourself to sleep, this is the book that will do it.
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|The reason I gave it one star is because it didn't even load. I got it on my kindle and I was so excited that I could get it then it didn't even load. So then I restarted my kindle and tried it again but it still didn't load. So I uninstalled it immediately. I would have given it zero stars if I could. Totally disappointed. :-(
B009VL28W2|5.0|no load or reload crap this is the best setlist i wish they didnt include any magnetic but this show is called magnetic i guess i cant get all the 80s glories tracks ;)
B008O9V4C2|5.0|As the music industry is in its slow demise, it is great to hear Fagen again, reminding this 58 year old heart all is not lost.  He even has the same voice!  \\"I'm not the same without you\\" is a new classic.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|I love this season more so than the last! I will keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time.!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I absolutely love this show.  I love it so much I buy the current episodes on amazon just to keep up.  Totally worth it!
B009JZWO3I|5.0|It's getting better and better.  Stockard Channing and Peter's mother I can't wait for the fireworks.  I like Alicia with Peter not Will.  It was a nice diversion. I would love to see Diane's character developed more.  Overall the season is looking pretty good.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Couldn't wait to get through the sex for the next vaguely interesting bit.  I was taken in by the hype, this is complete rubbish!
B008A1NSTG|3.0|What i did watch was a little bit corny. Meh. I would maybe watch again if it came on TV.
B004LROUW2|5.0|Sentences so clever you have to re-read them, the story is woven not told.  I loved this, it's one of the best from Murakami I believe.
030759565X|5.0|My wife has been a fan of the website for a long time. This is a great accompaniment for fans or just a great recipe book for people who love to cook.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|The cross-globe antics of the 100 year old man somehow becomes believable!  Loved this, I think it's fun, you really identify with the old man, and it's a good stomp through major world events of his era.
B008D28HYS|5.0|Cross Me Color and Cross Me are my favorite puzzle games! Great games to challenge your thinking abilities. Worth the money. New puzzles are added frequently.
B006IYG5HE|3.0|The book was a little hard to follow at first and I nearly quit reading it but I did continue and the book did get better.  I will probably try another book by this author.
B004GYY714|5.0|This is great!! I can listen to podcasts of shows when they aren't live and don't have to deal with all the commercials.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Was really looking forward to reading and was really disappointed when I did.  The story seemed quite improbable and silly..I have no desire to continue with this trilogy as the rest of it I believe is quite predictable.
B000067QMD|5.0|What a great idea to be able to turn your bottle into a sealed container. I never used Avent bottles for feeding but I have an Avent breast pump and would store my milk in the bottles. These were great.
0345529057|5.0|Great books arrived on time  hhddnh hdsch gong g g g d f. H gc g g g g h g g
B009HEJXFS|5.0|This was a great movie!! i've been a big fan of all three and this one is no exception! The Acting is good and the story plot is in my opinion up to the MIB standards!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I highly recomend this for your daily Bible study. There is one by Joel Osteem, &amp; also one by Joyce Meijer.  Give them a try!
B0043RSK3K|5.0|This is one of the most revealing books I have read in years. It summarizes many missed opportunities for the US to have done better except  that we were so sure that we knew better than the rest of the world.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Fantastic and addictive for a free app I have not found any that was this enjoyable. Top marks to the developers.
0470913029|4.0|Book was purchased for info on said diet and to follow diet with a crossfit training regiment seems to work well hand in hand
B0073LWEXK|5.0|such a great game on my kindle fire. yes I used the hint when I need but it still was so fun!
B0063IH60K|5.0|You can always count on solitaire.<br />I mostly play in the evening when I' not in the reading mood.<br />Always fun.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Well written holds your interest all the way through I do not usually read YA books but I guess I will have to start also very timely what with the state of politics now could not put it down also watched the movie after reading the book
0439023513|5.0|It was a good end to the series, although....if I'm going to be 100% honest, I gotta say the last few chapters seemed rushed. Worth the wait though.
0316044695|5.0|This book is so inspirational & damn near unbelievable. To learn & get good insight into what our brave men of the Navy Seals go through is incredible!
B001H1SVO8|5.0|If you haven't seen this classic movie at least take the time to rent it.  This is an amazing role by Norton and Pitt in which the fight between inner happiness and pleasing others.  Sound too deep?  Trust me, the name tells you there is fighting, this is a fun movie that will keep you guessing the whole way through.
0547884591|5.0|I've read Tim Ferriss' first two books, and he just keeps getting better. If you are at all interesting in exploring cooking and learning, this is the book for you. I would say that this book has more of a \\"masculine\\" approach to cooking, which is good for me, but the lessons learned are valuable regardless.<br /><br />There is a LOT of book here. This is no novel, but it is full of cooking lessons interspersed with lessons on learning and life. I've just started to explore this book, and glad to do it.
B0027ZAWG8|4.0|I'm not a great fan of sci-fi or futuristic movies, but this one gets my vote.  Good cast and acting, and plenty of action to go alongside.  A bit scarry as it touches on some things that are already making history.
B008GXHOFW|2.0|Wow. Waste of money! Graphics are okay... Combat is lame!! Voicing is retarded. I'm glad I got it when it was only 99c.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|This movie was good.  The filming was good.  Kristin Stewart is not a very good actress, but everyone else did a good job.
0345803485|1.0|Thankfully, the repetitive writing style forced me to look up this book's summary to see if it is worth my time. It is not. Neither is writing a lengthy review on it. Glad I rented it from the library before wasting my money.
B005ZTFPFQ|5.0|Been over 30 years or so, good to play again. Nice adaption for the Android, and it was free! A++
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|my friend was playing this game on his ipod so I thought It looked good so I got it for my iphone and later for the kindle.it is so much fun breading dragos and making your own island. my only problem with this game is you have to wait a lot or you pay.
B005NFW0U0|5.0|It's got everything you want in a TV show, drama, romance, action and spice to it. Actors are very good to me and I enjoy watching this show. It doesn't have a lot of cursing which I appreciate.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|This movie isn't for young children persay, more for the young adult teen (and old age teenagers ;) I really enjoyed this offering from Disney....I can't say that for many of the Disney offerings from the past few years. Entertaining, fast paced with a good life message thrown in. I liked it and would encourage others that found charm in Disney's early works to give it a try.
B0067Q04AM|5.0|The BEST ALBUM of the DECADE!The BEST ALBUM of the DECADE!The BEST ALBUM of the DECADE!The BEST ALBUM of the DECADE!The BEST ALBUM of the DECADE!The BEST ALBUM of the DECADE!The BEST ALBUM of the DECADE!The BEST ALBUM of the DECADE!The BEST ALBUM of the DECADE!The BEST ALBUM of the DECADE!The BEST ALBUM of the DECADE!The BEST ALBUM of the DECADE!The BEST ALBUM of the DECADE!The BEST ALBUM of the DECADE!The BEST ALBUM of the DECADE!The BEST ALBUM of the DECADE!The BEST ALBUM of the DECADE!DECADE!The BEST ALBUM of the DECADE!The BEST ALBUM of the DECADE!The BEST ALBUM of the DECADE!The BEST ALBUM of the DECADE!

B009RI4ZKC|5.0|a movie to lift your spirits and make you laugh...take a trip to the Moonrise Kingdom and be entertained; a must see.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The writers and producers are keeping the plots realistic and riveting! Can't wait till the mid season hiatus is over
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Keep it coming. Make the plot a little deeper.  Add some dysfunctional government troops and destroy Woodbury.  I will continue to watch irregadless.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I chose this book because I had to since I read the previous ones and because I was curious.  I heard a lot of negative feedback about the movie so to those that struggled to follow the movie, I think reading the whole series will aid them in enjoying the movie(s) to come. However, I wish that Katniss could have killed both Snow and Coins.
B007HACDLK|2.0|This book just did not click with me...I kept reading hoping to get into the story but was so bored I did not finish<br />reading the book.
B007HACDLK|5.0|The worst part of the series involving our national hero, Mitch Rapp, is having to wait between publications of the installments.  This one is as good as the others, which means it is great.  It is as current as the front page in terms of the story line, and provides insight into the tortured minds of our enemies, the challenge to our intelligence community, and the crying need for men and women of honor who might be willing to sacrifice for us all.  One of my deep and abiding hopes and prayers is that there is a real life Mitch Rapp somewhere.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Heart warming story which I enjoyed very much and would recommend as an worthwhile easy read.  The<br />story kept me interested until the very end.
B004LWZWGA|3.0|A lot of these movies nowadays come with the Ultraviolet copy and I am one of those people who doesn't want to go into clouds to watch movies.  If you are too cheap to include an actual digital copy, you can do without this garbage as well
B0088X7YMS|5.0|Great film. This is much much better than those two awful sequels they made. This is how they should have been done but they didn't want to waste money on special effects or hire better writers. This film was worth buying and those two DVD films will be long forgotten.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|I can't fault anything wrong with the movie. Will be a great enjoyment to watch on the home entertainment system.
B007QNRMUU|5.0|First heard this on a 10 hour flight...over and over, couldn't get it out of my head.  Came back home and had to buy it.  After a stressful day this CD is like therapy :)
B004GBFF5Y|1.0|I could not finish this mess...everyone in it should be embarrassed kind of a very poor production , story and cast!
B0091HVMVO|1.0|Metadata is the encoded information built into most quality CDs. Info like artist, composer, and track information are encoded so that modern CD players ( like the one in you car or living room) can read the CD and inform you what the CD and selection is.<br /><br />This new 55 CD Phillips Box Set should have the same data encoded onto each CD as on each jacket cover. Fully 80%. Of these CDs lack jacket image data as Metadata, and #s 1,8,17,20,21,22,23,28,32,33,34,38,41,42,49 52, and 53 have ZERO metadata, so they essentially are filed as &#34;Unknown&#34; to modern CD players.<br /><br />That means that these CDs simply take up hard drive space, and are not accessible for listening except thru blind selection. You can't listen to what you can't find. Like going to a library filled with un indexed books that have no jackets.<br /><br />This Phillips Box Set was just released this week, so it isn't like they are dated CDs. It would seem the box set has been remastered, and repackaged, but lacks the vital encoded information to make this set useful to modern CD systems.<br /><br />Don't bother buying this new Phillips Box Set. It is simply incomplete or at minimum improperly manufactured.<br /><br />I will return mine.
B004V5A7K8|5.0|Nice game to play. I thought it would be another dull game, but it turned out to  be very enjoyable.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|like other gameloft games this one is pretty good I have enjoyed a fair amount of. there game and I believe this is another good one. it requires wifi also but that's not a real problem. P.S. don't go and rate a game to be first without rating it. no one cares who SAW the game first
B008K8VDPU|5.0|I wouldn't say this app is the only one for everybody, but for most people, if you only want to get one music play-along app, this is probably the one. It isn't as demanding as some, but you can certainly challenge yourself. It doesn't have scoring, so you might miss that if you're competitive or want an objective assessment of your performance. It has a nice song selection, classical and some easy public domain songs. There is an option for users to record songs and share them via a cloud server, so that may provide some imperfect modern songs - it already has a flawed version of \\"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\\". Love the available settings/options and the visible lengths showing how long to hold the notes. For 4 bucks I just bought the diamond edition, unlocking all instruments, songs, and magic piano mode. Now I think I won't get any more apps, although I'll keep most of the other apps I've downloaded; they all have some of their own good points and fit different moods and occasions. Again, if I had to keep just one, this would be it.<br /><br />  UPDATE: I bought the Diamond edition and wasn't impressed, but if you have to buy the Diamond edition to get the feature that allows you to import MIDI songs, GET IT!!! The one thing I see people complaining about over and over is that there aren't enough songs, and with this feature you can get many, many songs for free! If you're really clueless about MIDI and handling files, find a friend or relative who can help you. With many songs, you do have to experiment a bit to find the melody track, but that's not much of a drawback, and if you have a MIDI editor on your computer, such as the free Anvil Studio, you can easily find out which one it is and pick your favorite accompaniment track to auto-play or use to practice your left-hand playing. This feature definitely makes this THE BEST piano app I've tried!
156224003X|5.0|This is a fantastic book and read for musicians who struggle with confidence<br />In playing their instrument. Highly recommended and I am a pro musician.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|At first I was hesitant about dropping the $16 for a game, but I love FF and nothing else was holding my interest. I'm so glad I did it. It looks wonderful on my Kindle Fire HD and the controls are better than I expected. This is an actual game and it's fun! You won't regret it. :)
B005LAJ23A|5.0|This is a fun escape from the daily grind.  My husband and I have enjoyed the shows and a looking forward to more.  The quality is very good.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|This is one of those games that you wished for if you want to give your child a fun, safe, ad-free game. I find my son going back to it still after months.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I chose this rating because I have read all the books and I think there excellent books. So I give it a five star rating.
B009K45Y62|1.0|Didn't include the actual Blu Ray Movie with mine! Can't replace it because its limited edition so I have to return it and went to Best Buy to buy a copy. THANKS!
B006LSZECO|5.0|...and i am a tough customer!  This is an excellent, well written novel that keeps you turning the pages late into the night.  Refreshing!  I look forward to more Flynn books!
B004GBIE3Y|4.0|I thought it was a cute, heartwarming story. It was had some funny parts and I generally really liked it!
B004EI924E|5.0|Great escapist movie.  Settle down and watch professional actors do their thing very well. Lots of action and within the rather elastic parameters of the genre fairly believable. Good movie for a quiet evening where you just want to enjoy a action story.
B0084U0IEG|1.0|Having great respect for McEwan's novels of the past, this was the biggest disappointment to me.  It is phony from start to finish.
B00A12Z264|5.0|I've always liked listening to Christina Aguilera since I was a teen, so I can say that I've been a fan of hers for half my life.  Her music is powerful, fun, energetic, and also moving.  What's not to love about Lotus?!  I seriously can't get her songs out of my head and have to listen to them everyday since I purchased it!  It's addicting!
075669812X|5.0|My Grandson loves Ninjagos!  He talks about them and their relationships with one another so I hope he LOVES this book.  The book itself is very worth the money.  I saw the book first on E-bay for a much higher price.  For the heck of it, I checked Amazon and I'm glad that I did!  Great book, great value.
B009ZFPQOQ|5.0|Great app. Real time traffic, accident reports, weather and so much more.<br />Has a video game feel to it but its very well made, give you the option to take diff. Routes.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|Worse than having to pay for it twice is that you can only take a picture of yourself, it does not take pictures the way that it should, terrible design. Don't waste your money turning it on.
B005V2S7FW|5.0|One of the best apps I have ever used on any platform; iOS, Windows, Linux or Android!<br />These developers know what they are doing!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|fun but makes you go cross eyed. Why do I need to type more words for this review OK one more.
B005BZQVJ8|4.0|It's a comedic home run staring Simon Pegg & Nick Frost together again. Shaun of the Dead & Hot Fuzz are better but this one is pretty damn good considering Seth Rogan plays a alien & I don't like his work. He's just not funny, no wonder why he and strisand are in a movie together coming soon.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|this is the amazing story of an amazing hero, father, husband, warrior, and christian.<br />definatly should read it. it could have a positive impact on you.  i know it did me.
B002RVCD0U|4.0|Minus the psychotic issues Christian Bale had on the set (just another angry psycho Australian at it again, first Mel Gibson then Bale), this is a good movie.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved this book. In the begining I thought her charactor was a little whimpy but after the books moves forward I was surprised and amused at where her charactor went. I wouldn't want to be in her social circle but she was definately an interesting charactor!! I felt the same about him as well and I know that some people hated the book for it's ending but I liked it. I thought they deserved each other.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I want more:) I love reading and watching movies like this. I gave it 4 stars because im not thrilled with the whole Bates situation. Its so unfair to him and anna, however I understand that Amazon has nothing to do with the writeing.
1451695195|5.0|The books was all that it said it was.  It was a wonderful story I read the book in one day.
0792839749|5.0|This was a favorite movie from my childhood now it is one of my granddaughters favorite. they dont make movies like this any more, wish they did
1935251740|5.0|Honestly, I didn't understand a lot about quantum physics before I read this book.  I think I know have only a very basic understanding of the implications of this field of research - even after reading the book.  But the book opened my eyes to not well understood questions our research has brought up, and it facinated me.  I think Lanza has dared to propose a theory that explains what science has demonstrated - and if he is right, it has far-reaching implications -- and possibilities.  Thrilling and fascinating!
0515153656|4.0|Good fun read. Lots of action and a nice plot that keeps you riveted from the beginning. I've read several Jack Reacher books and this was middle of the road for Lee Childs yet still worth the distraction
1442444053|5.0|I love the book especially the illustrations they were really beautiful.  The rabbits and scenery were amazing, they brought the story to life.  My friends thought the book was beautiful and are planning to buy it.<br />Margaret

B004XDYJRU|4.0|This is a good app for listening to the radio. It has more of the local radio stations involved as well as many other stations.
B007GYREYI|5.0|I LOVE THE BOOK AND THIS DVD AND THE ACTORS. MR DARCY IS A VERY QUIET PERSON AND HE IS LIKE ME IN MANY WAYS EXCEPT I AM A GIRL. I DON'T TALK TO PEOPLE TILL I KNOW THEM AND HE DOESN'T EITHER. WHEN HE LOVES SOME ONE NO MATTER WHAT HE FINALLY GET'S WHAT HE WAN'T AND HE TRULEY LOVED, ELIZABETH. THEY ARE A GREAT MATCH. I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE SOME ONE WHO LOVED ME THAT MUCH. IT IS A GREAT SHOW AND HAVE SEEN 4 OR 5 TIMES. I LOVE THE DVD.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I am very happy with this case cover.  It holds my Kindle Fire securely and is very lightweight and easy to hold.  It will stand when secured as shown on a desk top or table.

0525478817|5.0|After a two year waiting period, John Green has done it again with his most recent masterpiece, \\"The Fault in Our Stars.\\" His compelling use of wit, humor, and a captivating plot gives him the rightful title of a New York Times Bestselling Author.<br /><br />\\"The Fault in Our Stars\\" tells the tale of Hazel Grace Lancaster, who is a 16-year-old girl diagnosed with terminal cancer, and her encounter with Augustus Waters, a 17-year-old patient in remission. They meet at a cancer support group and become fascinated with each other (to say the least), beginning a beautiful friendship and selfless romantic relationship.<br /><br />Green gives readers an inside perspective of a terminally ill teenager, and does a fantastic job of creating bittersweet and authentic characters. Having the position of #1 on the New York Times Bestseller list for at least two weeks, assures readers that this is a book to capture your attention and your heart strings.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Hate when the seasons over.  Great watching it on Amazon because I miss all those horrible commercials which takes away from the show.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This app is great for planning. Helps make decisions easier for clothing selections to local and travel locations. You can choose a destination around the world or down the street. If you like radar, it has it.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|Great action, would like to have seen more from Jason, and Jet Lee. Van Dam was annoying but over all thumbs up.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|This book was recommended by my sweet daughter in law.  It did not disappoint.  It was so good I found it difficult to put down. Was not aware of the French involvement in the holocaust.  Like Julia, I felt compelled to learn more about it and did so.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Let's be honest.  I didn't use my Kindle Fire a whole lot since I received it for Christmas last year, and not having a Pinterest app was one of the main reasons.  I'm super addicted to the site, and not having a user-friendly way to re-pin and see my existing pins, had me reaching for my iPhone instead.  Now I can use my Kindle Fire beside my workstation in my studio for constant inspiration from Pinterest!
1419705849|4.0|I can't say I've ever read one of these cover to cover but my 9 year old has been reading them since he was 6 and he loves them. Anything that keeps them reading is alright by me!
B004LROUNG|3.0|Not up to the usual John Grisham standard.  It was repetitive and boring at times.  I do not recommend it.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Must see first one! and if not then it doesnt matter because each season is a complete diffrent scary story. may favorite show right now since i saw season 1!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This book grabbed my attention immediately and I couldn't put it down until it was finished.  What more can I say?
B00008G7UF|2.0|It was ok.  Wish I could give this a great review, sorry.  But, it was still ok, if you're interested.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|A band On-Demand... Incredible vocal group! A must have for anyone who likes music! I keep it on repeat all day!
0761158820|3.0|The monsters designs are great, and once you manage to assemble them they really look like the pictures. High quality paper, bright colors, and a wide variety of designs.<br />However, this is not really a kids book. There are a lot of small foldable parts that you need to glue. Unless you are using a glue gun (which most young kids won't), you have to put pressure for a couple minutes (until the glue dries) each time you glue two parts together. Considering that many of these models have 10-20 parts you have to glue, the whole assembly of just one monster can easily take over half an hour.<br />So the results are very cute, but the process of assembling them is long, tedious and often frustrating for young kids.
B003V9OCIS|5.0|Don't let the fact that it is English Subtitled turn you away from watching this gripping and realistic climbing movie.  One of the best and realistic films showing the courage and the ethics of the early days of climbing.  One reviewer panned the movie for \\"taking liberties\\" with the facts. Every movie \\"based on true events\\" takes that liberty from time to time.  It in no way detracts from the quality of the film or the storyline either.  After watching this film, you will have a new perspective about mountaineers and why they do what they do.  If you climb you will identify with the emotions and motivations that drive these men. If you don't climb, be prepared for a riveting and suspenseful story that may or may not turn out the way you thought it would. Excellent to the very end.
0547884591|5.0|I was already playing around with learning to become a better cook using healthy paleo recipes. I have been a big fan of Tim's since the 4 hour work week and owe a lot to him as far as my thinking and \\"lifestyle design\\"  I purchased the book from Amazon the first day it was out.  I will say that I spent 3 days reading the entire book (you don't have to do this) before I went out and purchased a dutch oven to make lesson #1.  It was unbelievable.  I made the first dish Osso Bucco and I also made the mashed cauliflower.  Not only was the food great, but the night continued to go very well, if you know what I mean.  I was no cook before.  Eggs and hamburgers on the grill.  Tim makes this easy and simple.  Thanks Tim!
B009VB97EY|3.0|I know, just the subject matter should have warned me. But I hoped for more. The story could have been, excuse the pun, fleshed out a lot more. There was potential. The dialogue was stilted many times- striving too hard to be edgy and cool, but it lacked anything solid to hold on to.  It played straight into the pretty but stupid stereotype it was trying to get past.  In the end, I could see no other reason for the girl and boy to hook up other than unresolved lust. Okay, that has its place, but it seems the movie was striving for something more but ended up falling straight into the cliche anyway.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|This third installment is a great addition to the series. It does a great job explaining the back story of K & J. Very funny, clever and great visuals as well.
B008QE9XD2|3.0|I personally liked the original TV series better than this film and the Revival TV series in the 1990's decade starring Ben Cross.  Although I feel that Johnny Depp did a better job than Ben Cross in playing the role of Barnabas, I still feel that Jonathan Frid on the original TV series was the best of all.  Jonathan Frid played the role of Barnabas so well that I don't feel that he could ever be surpassed by any other actors.  There were some differences in this film compared to the original series such as Barnabas telling Elizabeth Collins Stoddard his secret which he didn't tell Elizabeth in the original TV series.  Some of the photography in this film was good and modernized.  As one other reviewer said, the original TV series in the 1960's was a success because of the conversations and dialogues taking place between the characters.  I feel that the original TV series can never be surpassed because of its own uniqueness.
B009LRE040|4.0|There's nothing more I can say about the final installment of Nolan's exemplary Dark Knight trilogy in terms of production quality, acting, action, story, and execution, which are all top notch. But I have to question the decision to bump up the volume of the musical score to such a level that much dialogue is lost when it crescendos, which it does frequently. It's not simply a matter of A/V quality as I noted the same problem when the movie was still in theaters. For some reason, in the case of this movie, a decision was made to bring the score to the fore, making it what I consider an unseen but definitely heard leading character. Frankly, the music is WAY too loud and becomes a massive distraction to an otherwise fine film.
B0084U0IEG|1.0|Not very interesting or compelling.  I did not finish this book, which is a first for me.  Amazon recommended it, so I thought I would give it a try.  Very disappointed!!!
B003B02O14|5.0|Great book....I have been a John Grisham fan for a long time.  This is another great book by a great author.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is one of the best shows on T.V.! It is simply a must-watch every week. I never miss it!
B00AE2J93I|4.0|The movie was good, but our video stream stopped with about five minutes remaining so we actually didn't get to see the very end of the movie.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love challenges and this game keeps on challenging! It is one of the best! If you like a challenge, try this! Once you get the hang of it, you feel like you've accomplished something!
B000HKW7E0|5.0|We watch it every year!<br />It'snow a classic-kids and<br />grandkids laugh each time<br />and I've given it as Christmas gifts.
B0030MM68O|4.0|Jeremy Renner is cute and his character is both comedic and honed to serious edge.  He and his costars bring some of the reality of war into the viewer's home.
B0084IPVOU|1.0|This book came to us in a blue cover, not what the book is suppose to be, was suppose to be green super mad!!!!
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Prometheus rocks! What an awesome prequel. When I first saw it in the theater, I wasn't sure what to think of it. But after chewing on it for a few days, I realized I loved this movie. What a great prequel. Hope they continue with this story.
B003Y5H5HY|4.0|There's no denying that the source material for The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is brutally graphic and downright depressing. Don't expect a happy-go-lucky mystery film when you watch it as the themes and tones are extremely dark and there a couple of scenes that are very hard to stomach (if you've read the book, you know what scenes I'm talking about). However, the thing that makes this movie so good is that fact that, even with this dark and troubling plot, the film is still able to be captivating and enthralling.<br /><br />Enough can't be said for Rooney Mara's performance as Lisbeth Salander, who shows total and utter dedication to the title role. Her on-screen presence can't be denied and I believe this is a part she was born to play. Daniel Craig is also terrific in the film as the investigative protagonist, bringing an intense yet charismatic feeling to the character. Equally impressive is David Fincher's directing, which is on full display here. Having seen everything he's been involved with from Alien 3 to Social Network, I believe this is one of, if not the best, film he's done to date.<br /><br />This movie can't be recommended to everyone but if you enjoyed the book as much as I did, you'll more than likely enjoy watching this movie. I haven't seen the original Swedish version so I can't make any comparisons, but this U.S. version is quite a treat.
B005PK553C|4.0|Season 1 of American Horror story had a good vibe. Weird in a good way. Season 2 is definitely different but it's growing on me.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|This game is very fun, but I do have a few problems. The first is that it needs more games. I'm bored out of my skull when playing the ball bounce game and that pops up about half the time. Second, I would be fine paying five dollars for Celestia and paying an additional 5 dollars for other background ponies but I will NOT pay 95 dollars! I understand you need to make money and I don't need her, but you must be losing a lot of customers over that and RD and Rarity. Also, social networking is kinda buggy for me, and a problem like that is bound to repeat. I would also like to be able to zoom out more because I can only see half my town, which isn't helpful. I wish people would stop acting as if it is unreasonable to ask for money when they worked hard to make this game, I only ask that you ask for a smaller amount.
B0072S9KU4|2.0|I am sorry. My sister recommended this movie to me and I am starting to wonder if maybe, we have different parents for real....I like a good horror,gory,weird whatever what have you kind of movie but...this movie was dumb.
B007SGM084|5.0|i wish they would make a movie on it.... such a great story. i was hooked from the very beginning
B005RUUUAI|5.0|This show is awesome. Great writing and awesome actors. Hope this one sticks around for a while. Looking forward to February!
B009NQKPUW|3.0|it was.........just another in  the line of Alien flicks, so so , no no no ok ok ok ok ok
B008NB0SQO|5.0|Of course I loved this movie. I recommend it for people of all ages. It is definitely a must have.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|Supernatural is the best thing to happen to tv!!!!!!!!! season 5 was awesome!!!! I love how this show lets you in deeper on the trials the brothers dean and sam go through.
B0055EDBIE|3.0|I am a Lenny fan and I enjoyed this but not as much as I felt I could have. Lenny has lost some of his creative juices from a few years ago.
B0045XICB2|5.0|I couldnt stand the books but I love the guilty pleasure of the movie.  Some parts were corney, but overall the story is good and I enjoyed it.
B004QSQML8|5.0|This is one of Ridley Scott's best. I used to watch this movie every Saturday morning growing up as a kid and it still has a certain effect on me...Awesome movie.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|This little game is a great time waster.  All of the missions keep you coming back for more so the game play doesn't get stale.  Since you are always earning coins there is no need to actually purchase any unless you are just impatient.
B005IQZB14|1.0|I am glad that Cheryl found herself, but the book is self serving and is another person trying to find the &#34;meaning&#34; in life and put a self important spin on thier poor choices....
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Great movie, brand new, my family enjoyed the story, it was inspiring, and the quality of the production was very professional
B008WCP2KG|5.0|Great performances! Great actors! Lots of sexy dances!! Handsome guys! Great bodies! It's just great for having a good time with friends! Just sexiness all over!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I purchased this movie for my son for Christmas, but we watched it after it came out on dvd and he absolutely loved it! I was amazed with how well the movie was made and the graphics in the film. I loved Dr. Seuss as a kid myself and now it is such a treat to be able to share such a wonderful part of my childhood with my son and see the same joy and excitement come alive on his face that I know I once had on mine.
B00AE2J5HI|2.0|This movie went overboard on both the quantity and type of violence,  we had turned it off after 30 minutes..
B000B589JI|5.0|I always use Zippos and have in the past found myself without fuel in the most inconvenient of circumstances where a refill was impossible, on a boat or on a business trip for example.<br /><br />The canister has now ensured that I have enough fuel when the one in the lighter has dried up.  Nice tight closing mechanism, convenient size and good holding capacity.<br /><br />Would definitely recommend to others.
B004X75RK4|5.0|Although it's a classic Sandra Bullock story, Ryan Reynolds really helps make this one work.  Some very funny lines throughout and awkward moments had us cracking up.  If you haven't seen this one yet, it's worth the rent!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Calling YouVersion's app \\"The Holy Bible\\" is really a misnomer of sorts.  It's not \\"The\\" Bible, it's about 20 translations.  Instead of putting a book under your arm, it's like a big backpack full of Bibles - only lighter, and cross linked.  If you're reading a passage in, say, the NIV, you can quickly change to the New King James, or the New Living Translation, the Message or many more, and it will come up at the same verse.<br /><br />Excellent for studying anywhere, anytime you get a few minutes.  Yeah, you need a connection to the web, although some versions can be downloaded onto your Kindle (or other device - they have versions for lots of platforms) for reading if there is no net connection.<br /><br />Highly recommend for those who like to immerse themselves in the Word, or who just want to look up a verse.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I enjoyed this work tremendously.  Eben Alexander experienced a miracle and I believe he did because he is a scientist and therefore much harder to dispute.  He did the right thing by coming forward and writing about his experience.  This book offers a great deal of comfort for those on the edge of belief and those going through tough situations.
B002I0J5FG|1.0|Didn't seem fun. Stopped after 2 hours. I didn't play SOC at all. Fights are just boring.  I usually like solving puzzles, but they were not fun. Either too easy to solve or the puzzle wasn't clear and you'd just guess.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I liked this because you grew to know the two main characters, jumping back and forward from him to her .  Their early years were exposed bit by bit as the story went on.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|So surprised on the turn of events! Loved it and even cried at points? Glad the book brought you full circle!
B00338QENI|3.0|Some very interesting medical information, however,  I would have liked a little more of the lady's  personal story. This is for someone who is interested in the medical field.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|It was entertaining to watch. I originally wanted to see this in the theater but glad I didn't. John Claude should have guest appeared in the first. His character was almost unlikeable. Overall I liked the move just because I've seen all of each of the individual stars action films over the years.  It was more of a nostalgic fun Saturday night rental
B0058W74UY|2.0|Didn't work for me. Browser said I needed Flash player but it wouldn't work after download. Removed it from my Kindle.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My 4 year old daughter loves this game even if she cant always do everything all by herself.  It even can occupy my time once in a while.
0920668372|1.0|My MIL gave this book to my husband when our first baby was born.  Hellish MIL experiences we have all heard about soon followed.  This book is totally creepy, tries to normalize complete lack of BOUNDARIES and inappropriate behavior.  YIKES!
B007THA4FI|4.0|This 1st venture into adult fiction is a captivating  journey into small town life beyond the Disney dream. Whether in Scotland or the US, the jealousies and prejudices of people are caught in a realistic manner.  The young characters are drawn the best with all their flaws and tributes.  This book could provide exuberant discussion in a book club.  Good vs. selfishness is an ample theme throughout the very believable plot.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very good, and a big surprise.  Story well told. Brillant woman pulling the strings.  Gone girl's parents should go to prison.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Same great work from Mr. Riordan continuing the Heroes of Olympus series. Percy just can't seem to escape being put in situations where he has to figure everything out from square one. Also nice cameos from the original series.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|It was an engaging book.  Certainly, the last part was unsettling.  I would recommend it, but it is not a feel good book.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Headline says it all... that's why it's great.  It can trick your phone into thinking Youtube files are music files, and listen to them as if they were mp3's.  Not to mention, the possible video quality you can get is great!
B00A0SQBDM|3.0|They should let you know its a trial. Not the full game disappointing and does not tell you how much it cost.
B007ZRZF8I|4.0|This game seems to go on forever... in fact, there's even a setting to make sure that it does.  It is a fun, fast paced way to pass the time.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I play Mhjong on my computer, on my Ipod and now on my Tablet. I consider myself to be a Mahjong addict. This game has great graphic style. Moves are smooth and not choppy like some other products I've used. Lots of levels, some good backgrounds and again, very addictive. Hours can go by before I realize it. So be careful if you have a schedule to keep to, you just might miss something!
B000OCXI3K|5.0|A good book to read for relaxation and to escape into another world for a while.  Interesting characters kept the imagination engaged.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I am at the 60th level and still playing.  I wish there was more than 50 energies at a time.  I reach another level and I would stil have 20 energies and it would go to only 50 and I loose the other 20.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|Picture quality is really know. Not quite what I expected. Functionality is easy to use though. More a novelty than an actual camera
B008Z9L94O|5.0|This reissue of the MCIS is amazing on every level.  While it isn't in the original 1995 UK reissue track listing, for those of us just getting the chance to enjoy this amazing album on vinyl, it will seem familiar, in a good way.  This album seems to transcend time and space to stay culturally relevant.  I won't go into specifics as that is part of the fun!  The album itself is on 180 Gram high grade vinyl, black.  The case is high quality and looks great along with the other Smashing Pumpkin Reissues. Do yourself a favor and get these for yourself or another Pumpkin fan with a vinyl set-up, you won't be sorry!
B0093WVND4|5.0|I love this book for the details and creativity it was great book and I recommend this for you. Ronald dahl
B009YP9L7U|5.0|If you haven't already this book is a must read.  I loved it!  It will stay in my collection to be read again.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|A wonderful product.<br />Makes using the computer much easier.<br />It has earned a 5 starand then some.<br />Easy to use.
B005LAIHY0|4.0|I was not overly thrilled by this movie the first time around, but after the second time I really enjoyed it.<br /><br />Sequel in the works!
B004LWZWGK|1.0|It is unacceptable that movies do not include an iTunes digital copy.  UltraViolet does not, and cannot provide the same user experience as is afforded by iTunes media.
B009OYTAL8|5.0|Long time Green Arrow reader - I mean a very long time - since the 60's at least - I've seen many incarnations of Ollie over the years - my favorite being the Mike Grell storylines - and in the gritty street tough portrayal of the Hood the TV series Arrow hits damn close the Grell high watermark - plus I like the enclosed (and yet partially ongoing) nature of the plot lines - I perfer my eposodic TV to be eposodic - and the flashbacks to Ollie's formative years on the Island - perfect!
0547884591|5.0|By the time I finished scanning through the this tome (when are pocket editions coming out?) I've learned how to say \\"I need [insert ingredient]\\" in Spanish for 10 main ingredients. And if you have young kids - this is a great tool for experimenting, with little mess and a good chance they will actually learn and taste what was created! (Although I'm not buying that four-year-old cooking tomato soup story).<br /><br />One caution/advice though. Not a lot of people cooking these days, and since you need to have several subjects/friends to lab-test all this - they will get addicted pretty fast, and now you are expected to amaze and feed. Set the rules from the get-go - they bring ingredients (safe to identify ones for a non-cook) and you transform them.<br /><br />Bon Appetit.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It works well on the new Kindle HD and it's fun, too.  It gets really challenging starting with the 8x8 boards.  Give it a try!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|this compilation is one of my all time favorites. some of the best acting iv'e seen in my six decades on this planet. i  will continue to watch this collection until i leave.
B00931JMRE|5.0|The entire collaboration has the unique ZZ flavor that gets your body moving. Even though I like &#34;I Gotsta Get Paid&#34; and &#34;Consumption&#34;, I have to say my favorite are Dusty's riffs on &#34;Chartruese&#34;.  The entire CD is priceless. Another one to add to my ZZ collection.
B005P4PAVK|5.0|This show just keeps on delivering the quality, time after time. They add characters, just as a real life has more people join and leave, and they treat each character with respect and reverence.  Each character continues to grow, some more than others, as the show progress, yet the humor never stops.
0399160450|4.0|In his latest novel, Tom Clancy pairs up with Mark Greany to produce Threat Vector, another great installment in his techno-thriller series. Late last year these two authors released Locked On, based upon the continuing adventures of Jack Ryan Senior and Junior. The Ryans are back again in a new, high stakes cyber war, with the fate of the world in the balance. After an action packed beginning, the younger Ryan and his secret agency go to war against Chinese hackers, who are bent on destruction. I read this book through in one day, interrupted only by my job. Although I had planned to save it for an upcoming plane trip, I couldn't stop reading. It is that good. I cooled on Clancy for years, but this one has brought me back to fan status again.<br /><br />I fell in love with Tom Clancy's writing with The Hunt for Red October, a book that kept millions of us on the edge of our seats. In the 1980's his books were unique for their combination of fast paced action, solid characters, geopolitical intrigue and amazingly realistic details about tech and weapons, all brought together in exciting adventures. Unfortunately, his novels haven't always been excellent, especially when he began working with co-writers. I feel a little disappointed whenever I see his name sharing the front cover with someone else.  None of his co-written books have been as good as the original Clancy works, with the exception of his second novel, Red Storm Rising (co-written with Larry Bond).<br /><br />Clancy's writing has been criticized because his characters lack depth. They make clear cut decisions that are either good or bad, and the storylines portray an unapologetic American patriotism that has gone out of style in some quarters. There is little ambiguity in the early novels, and some characters, especially Jack Ryan, seem to be completely good, without any faults. In later novels Clancy allows Jack some vices, perhaps in response to critics, but this effort did not satisfy them, and might have alienated some readers.<br /><br />A writer has to change with the times, because the readers who loved his work in 1984 are different now, and we have different expectations. I have grown a lot older, and having read many books in the meanwhile, including an ever expanding list of techno thrillers, I admit that I am getting harder to please. Although I don't find Clancy's novels quite as wonderful as I used to, they are still very good. I recommend this one, but I couldn't quite give it five stars.ave alienated some readers.<br /><br />A writer has to change with the times, because the readers who loved his work in 1984 are different now, and we have different expectations.

0307596885|5.0|Reading an Alice Munro collection is like making my way down a favorite shelf of novels.  Each of these stories presents a complete life without going into minute detail, but using broad strokes.  Characters have complicated pasts that are not spelled out, and the pivotal moment inherent in the story is not readily recognizable.  The only downside is that I have to take a breather between stories -- they are too rich to be absorbed in one flash.
B007HACDLK|4.0|slow starter for Flynn, but he picks it up as the pages turn. A bit wordy.Sounds like he may be getting ready to put his hero out to pasture,

B009GEDP26|4.0|Every year Beckett and Castle get close, then fall apart.  This year they are closer than ever, finally taking the plunge and becoming a couple, but this takes the tension that has been a part of the show for several years now.  This will have to be resolved some how, so be prepared for something unpopular by the end of the season.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|As a big Steely Dan fan, I have bought all of the various Fagen and Becker solo projects, and have enjoyed them all, some more than others. Fagen's Morph the Cat was a little disappointing for me, but Sunken Condos is like vintage Steely Dan. I have played it over and over and it keeps getting better. \\"Weather in my Head\\", my favorite, has a very bluesy feeling, with taut guitar solos by Jon Herington, but a number of the tunes are memorable, and the lyrics are witty and fun. I hope that SD incorporates some of these tunes in future shows.
1400069289|4.0|I haven't finished the book yet, but so far I am totally engrossed. Well written; simple yet intelligent. Read it!

B0099TJ4YQ|5.0|One of my two favorite Christmas albums; my favorite is JT's soulful rendition of \\"in the bleak midwinter\\".  I've never heard \\"Who Comes This Night\\" before, but my husband and I both play it at least twice every time we listen to the album, and \\"Go Tell it on the Mountain\\", \\"River\\", and \\"Some Children See Him\\" are both spiritually moving. \\"Baby, It's Cold Outside\\" with Natalie Cole is cheerful and very amusing, and we find the reparte between the two believable enough that you can almost see the two of them playing around with the song.<br /><br />We love it.<br /><br />Listen to it.<br /><br />Buy it for someone.
B005IA9K2G|4.0|I love this movie and it is climbing up the favorites ladder. I just have to watch it every Christmas and I missed it last year so I ordered it this year. I kind of regret not purchasing this at a store or on blu-ray because this one seems like it was copied straight from a VHS. In the first 10 minutes it starts getting static lines and color changes like VHS' do, luckily it only lasted for a minute or two but the rest of the movie was fine. I am indifferent about blu-ray and DVD but I figured anything I bought on either would not act anything like a VHS. Perhaps it is the seller I purchased it from whose name unfortunately I do not remember.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I read the reviews from others and I will have to say that the game does pose some difficulty. However, it does give you a cheat board, that I did have to go to several times to figure out what to do next.  Often, though, once that done, I was able to figure out my next steps.<br /><br />I got it as a free app of the day, I dont think I would have been happy spending the money for it for several reasons:<br />1) the level of difficulty, its hard!<br />2) I finished it in three days, if I spent what they charge, I would want to be able to play longer.<br /><br />All in all, if you see this app for free, download it, you will get a kick out of it. It is fun, and it was beautifully crafted.
B009KKLQVS|2.0|Mike Love.....has got some real personal ego problems!  What was all this waving in a weird way throughout this DVD... 21 songs?  They did rip us off such a shame.  Not sure how about this DVD....but Mike Love has got problems. Now I understand why he fired all of them after this reunion was over so sad that he did that!  This really hurt Brian and Al who are real Beach Boys!
B007CGLRWA|5.0|As a story, the film is flawed. As a slice of life, it is relentlessly honest and real. I give it 5 stars because it made me remember my years of working as a teacher in Chicago, knowing that something had to be done, but you just couldn't do it. At best, you could help some, but never enough. God, this film hit home. I commend the filmmaker for trying to see all sides of the equation--students, teachers and those who walk beside them in the journey. Perhaps those of us who go into the helping professions do so because we need so much help ourselves. We heal the wound by reopening it daily as some sort of penance. Henry seems to be that sort of hurting healer that takes the burden on himself while he casts it away similtaneously. The section on doublethink may apply to him more than any other character, but the system itself and the society that spawns the dysfunction is equally a player in the 1984 scenario of believing the lie while knowing what it is.
B006Z9SP3E|3.0|Following on from the excellent 'Only Time Will Tell', this second book in the trilogy was rather disappointing. It was bland and, as a story, disjointed because of the way it was written - one character per set of chapters. It seemed as if it was just there to join books 1 and 3 together. So the jury is out until I have read the third book. Trilogies are all the rage, and it makes one wonder if this trend is just to ensure three sales instead of one.
0553582461|5.0|This series does a great job of avoiding the traps of common fantasy; not typical at all, lots of surprising twists in the series.  The interplay among the characters is great; there's a lot of psychology and introspection.  Not for young adolescents.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I like this game and will play it until my free coins are gone.  I don't like it enough to pay for additional coins.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Even though it's hard to get started with this book, I gave it a 5 because it is so worth it to finish.  In fact, one of the joys of getting to the end is going back to the beginning to make some of those parts make more sense and now have more meaning.  Not to say it doesn't unravel nicely - only that what happened to Pi after the main story is intermingled with what happened before the story.  While this lets us know who Pi is during the story - actually being crucial to the story - it's hard to realize it's importance while reading it at the beginning of the book.  I can't wait to see how they translate this into a movie.  I'm hoping to come away with the same wonderful feeling of joy.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|great graphics. very pretty game. the puzzles can be challenging. it kept popping up a crashs message when it wasn't. really crashed. hit wait and game play resumes. the hints refer to screen numbers. the screen numbers are on the map (a piece of paper that pops out of the inventory bag when you open the inventory.
B000FBFMZ2|4.0|Interesting premise with a science fiction spin on classic detective noir.<br />very well written with the SF being present without dominating the story.<br /><br />a warning for those readers not a fan of 50 shades, you may not like some segments in this book.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Great family Christmas movie - has become a family tradition and now we won't have to wait until it comes on TV anymore.
0739368044|4.0|Star Wars meets AD&D. Young man coming of age with surprising magical ability, no parents, only dragon alive. Elves, Dwarves, humans, \\"urgals\\" (aka trolls / trollocs / orcs).  It's good listening for my long car ride, but there aren't terribly many surprises (although there are more in this one than the previous two).
B001EBV0NU|4.0|This is really a dumb  movie, but it's SO silly that our family has adopted it as a favorite..  If you like to laugh, this one is for you.
B000SEFNMS|1.0|My fault, just wasnt what I was looking for. Too depressing to chronicle the death of a young person with such potential.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|The ease of purchasing this book is both rewarding and intimidating because you can make purchases without much thought! But when you are engrossed in a series.
B00003CXIP|5.0|I will keep this forever and pass it on to my children. I love this movie it's a great movie and if I lose this one I will most definently buy another one.
1595827684|5.0|This book is very cool! I only know this game by proxy, I've watched it being played but never played it myself. The story is excellent though, and when I stumbled upon this book at Barnes and Noble, I picked it up to take a look. A half hour later I was still sitting on armchair next to the mini-Starbucks perusing the pages. This book is basically an illustrated, annotated chronology of the evolution of the Mass Effect Trilogy. Its pages are full of the sketches of characters and places I only vaguely recognize, but I'm sure a player would instantly know. But from my standpoint, its just plain interesting. Seeing the process from the rough draft to the final product is out of this world. (wink wink) I knew I had to buy it as a gift for the gamer in my family. I pulled out the smartphone and much to my pleasure I found it for several dollars cheaper here on Amazon than in store. Instant purchase! Mind you, I am in my mid-twenties, not particularly into video games, and I was tempted to purchase one for myself. As is, I bought one for my brother-in-law who is 26 and a heavy gamer. I mention ages because this game is both violent and ladden with sexuality, not that I'm complaining, I say this is a recipe for excellent entertainment, but I wouldn't buy this book for children. It does have some nudity in it, its tasteful and artistic, but it is nudity. The cosutmes for women are typical &#34;bikini armor&#34; and therefore racy and womanizing, fine for the more discriminating less impressionable consumer. Also the creatures depicted are graphically scary, again these are beautiful pieces of art, however it might not be age appropriate for your nine year old. My opinion, the typical kid wouldn't appreciate this anyway, it doesn't give away secrets of the game, it doesn't ramble on and on about the gameplay, this book is truly what it title says. It is the Art of the Mass Effect Universe. Text is sparse and detailed renderings and sketches abound. Buy it for your mature gamer friend, or your budding graphic artist or anyone who is interested in the evolution of video games.
B009Z8HPYM|5.0|Every few albums, Neil figures out how to tap into his gold reserve and put out a few more nuggets on par with his best. The songs are all good (although there's one I'm not warming to still), but the 3 longest numbers on this album are what I'm talking about. I file them with 'Cowgirl', 'Hurricane', 'Cortez', etc.  Maybe the lyrics are not on par with those classics, but the music will take you away and back if you let it. It's what we love about him. The man inspires me!
0920668372|5.0|My kids were born in 1989 and 1991. I somehow found this book to read to them every night.  There wasn't a night, though, that I wasn't choking back the tears because at the same time, my parents were dying.  But it gave me strength to instill in my kids, at such a young age, that family is so important and we must stay together, and care for each other.  That's the gift my parents gave to me. My kids are now grown, embarking on their own lives.  Their father passed away 3 years ago, so they know about loss of a parent, at a too early age.  I've always tried to give my kids at least one unique Christmas present - something no one would expect.  Last year, it was stock pots with an old family recipe included that required a stock pot.  This year, I'm ordering 3 copies of this book, so they can read it to their children and continue the family tradition of loving unconditionally.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have read every Vince Flynn (Mitch Rapp) novel.  Great author and story lines.  I agree with the idea of starting at the beginning (Term Limits) then reading the books in sequence. Keep up the good work.
B001NLL93W|5.0|I was a &#34;can't put it down story&#34;! The series is fabulous and I got lost in the engrossing story!
B002DOSBMK|5.0|I am rereading this entire series, it was that good. I am 33 years old and I think I got a lot more out of the books when I was 17 or so, but they are still an entirely enjoyable read, and a quick read at that. Good story here about judging people by the color of their skin, although maybe that point is stressed just a little too much? All in all a great, entertaining book.
B005LAIHZE|5.0|better then i thought it would be thx thx thx thx thx thx thx thx thx thx thx thx thx
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I am a sci-fi/fantasy snob; very old school.  Since I consider most modern fantasy to be cheap imitation of Tolkien, I wouldn't touch this.  However, I broke down after it was recommended by people I respect.  Martin is on my list with Lessing and LeGuin for excellent social commentary and great story-telling.
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|This is a really cute app --- the whole family enjoys it!  Speak clearly and you'll hear your echo is a sweet high-pitch &#34;voice&#34;.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Mg original lasted a long time.  Good quality.  Since you will need it, might keep a spare.  That way you are nwver out of power.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl was an amazing read.<br /><br />I wasn't sure at first, but about a quarter of the way through the beginning of the book, I realized I couldn't really trust the narrator of the story. Either of them, really. It ramped up the suspense like crazy and I couldn't wait to finish the book just to see how it ended.<br /><br />Amazing read!
B004LROUW2|3.0|Have to say this is not his best book. There was just so much repetition of thoughts, feelings, and sentences- he should have shaved this thing down by at least a quarter. I feel bad criticizing a book when I haven't ever written a book, but those are just my honest opinions. Oh, and there are a lot of sex based scenes and thoughts, which I thought was just a bit too much. There is no real conclusion to the book either, so either he is setting himself up for a sequel or he just leaves you hanging in a way. Sorry, Harry M- I have read better from you!
B00884GR0W|4.0|I relly like this game its grafics are much beter than mindcraft but it needs werking Tnt that my only problem with it
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great storyline...could not put down<br />Cannot wait for third installment love it,love the characters....hot hot hot hot hot hot hot
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love this app but the fact that it has a small space of land to build on and that it iz EXTREMLY hard (for me) to get resources underground. But i still recommend it for download :D.
B009157BWU|5.0|Loved it great movie for whole family, one of the most entertaining movies ive seen in a while. Fun for all ages
B008OHV5QO|5.0|Originally saw this documentary in the theater.  We loved it so much that we ordered it pre-release!  This is Neil in his environment on his terms...simply awesome!
141694737X|5.0|HIGHLY recommend this book. Our daughter loves it, she has loved it from 6 months old to present day (15 months old)- any baby loves those lift the flap books, it gives them something to interact with and adds that element of surprise! We never get tired of this book and it is well enough constructed that it is still all in one piece while other books have been destroyed. Very glad we own this book.
1612930425|5.0|You know how you decide to read a classic becuase you assume that any book that has survived for this long to be great?  Then the entire time you read the book you hate it, but you are sure there is some reason it's a classic.  Finally, at the end of the book, you realize that you just wasted your time reading an awful book.  Well, this book isn't like that.  It's actually really great.  There are twists in the plot, a surprising end, good characters, and a loveable heroine.  If you like romance, then this is the book for you.
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved the characters.....recommended to my friends<br />Oh my...where is a man like cross......only in novels and in a really fertile imagination...WOW
B0091REZMW|3.0|my mom and fiance are addicted to this game. if you have friends who can multigift then you don't ever need to spend money. adding friends gives you free diamonds and visiting their rooms gives you free money. my mom is level 54 and has never spent a dime on it.
0375869026|5.0|From the very beginning, R.J Palacio has written words that let us know this isn't going to be an easy story to read. The point of view starts with a young boy of ten years of age who was born with a rare disfigurement and lets us know that he probably looks worse than we imagine. He goes by the name of August and he is strong willed and incredibly strong minded. I found myself crying so many times at how brave and strong this young boy was through so many trying times. He explains that he has never stepped inside of a real school, only to begin the journey soon enough.<br />  As August goes through his days inside of the life of a real school kid, he learns to deal with the name calling and shunning that he knew would happen. What I didn't know was that we would get to experience lives through the eyes of many of Augusts friends and even his sister, telling their side of the story and sharing in their experiences and beliefs of August.<br />  In the end, things came together quite like they should. Unfortunately, it was over certain circumstances that never should've taken place. Wonder is full of compassion, heartache, and love. Through many events in the book, you will want to wrap your arms tightly around August and hold him ever so tight. Many bonds take place, and many tears will fall.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This is my very favorite movie.<br />I watch it many times during the year.<br />There are other movies of this genre, but are not as good as this one.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|This case really is great, its pretty and it protects my Kindle Fire HD! I think others should buy it, and, I love buying stuff on my Kindle Prime it is so convenient!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I can't put my kindle down....its far from what I expected and entertaining.if Christian want so serious it could be a romantic comedy which is a genre I love. Call me crazy but....there's a lot of profanity  and its refreshing to see in a book. There's too much censorship in a lot of the books I've been reading. If you like indulging in fantasies....this book is definitely for you...is naughty and I like it !!!!!! I've read the trilogy three times by the way and was not disappointed.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I remember hearing negative comments regarding this movie on twitter around the time when it was released.  I think the only negative comment that fits is that the release title means nothing to most people.  If the movie was release as &#34;The Princess of Mars&#34; I don't think anyone would have complained about it.<br /><br />In any case, I've read the novel a long time ago (in Russian), and I've seen the graphic novel recently.  I actually enjoyed this movie most.
B003HV0TN2|4.0|Very engrossing, I went straight to book two and am now waiting for book three - which has no release date!
B00471TLZS|5.0|Had to share this one from the past with my 13 year old.  He loved it as well.  All smiles
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The news feed only gives me a dozen or so updates and no more. Fix it and I'll give it a higher rating.
0307472590|5.0|I really like this author.  Being a bit beyond a novice with the language and limited as to what titles I could buy local, this turned out to be an excellent option.
0385342063|5.0|Totally loved this book! I have been a long time fan, but this is by far my fave book so far!
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I love this clear case for my white iphone 4. Product shipped quickly and was a great price. Screen protector was a bonus.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I've always been a fan of Ken Follett's work. I began with Pillars of the Earth and got hooked. This new series of novels might well be his best yet. Follett weaves the actions of his characters skillfully with very detailed and accurate historical descriptions and interpretations in a way that makes this book a real delight. Buy it and ENJOY.
B0071XO8RA|1.0|The main characters are constantly changing with barely any reference to them again as the story goes on. There seems to be one mystery being worked on in the beginning that has greatly piqued my interests, yet it suddenly changes and I became bored. It's not as cohesive as I would like it to be
006029129X|5.0|Lovely collection of four imaginative stories!  Good for toddlers.  Simple and charming.  Nice size book, not too heavy or bulky.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham has the legal knowledge and background to understand and explain the law and the legal system in the US. I find his implied premise -- that we do not have a justice system, but rather a legal system -- to be quite refreshing for its truthfulness.  John Grisham's books and stories are written, I suspect, to show us the dangers of narrow thinking in pursuit of justice, which is seldom delivered forthrightly.<br /><br />Again in &#34;The Racketeer,&#34; he exposes the excesses of one of our more dubious &#34;laws&#34;, the RICO Act, as well as the roughshod and careless manner in which this law is enforced. Grisham's legal knowledge enables him to write intelligently and accurately about subjects that are on the top of most thinking people's minds, such as the abject corruption of our law enforcement agencies and the so-called judicial system into which many innocent people find themselves stuck without recourse. And he's a very good story teller.<br /><br />Without wishing to put too fine a point on his underlying message, I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a very good story of intrique and suspense masterfully told against the background of the exesses of our criminal laws and those who enforce them.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I use this alarm clock instead of my bedside one now!!!  I really like that it's got a crescendo rather than just blaring at me.
1582406723|5.0|This review is for the whole series in general not specifically towards this volume.<br /><br />Well when I was young I was obsessed with comics and because of how awesome the show is I decided to get back into the comic book scene. Be warned once you start you can't stop for it is extremely addictive to read! Just like the television show the comic is extremely character focused, you fall in love with some and hate others. Kirkman really knows how to give the characters personality, when I read it I can easily hear a different voice coming out of each character. Anyway because your so engulfed with these characters you simply MUST know what happens next. Robert Kirkman leaves you off with the worst cliff hangers everrr that pretty much force you into buying the next volume. Here I figured I'd casually read 2 or 3 volumes and in a matter of 2 months I'm up to date with the comic at volume 17 and now on the monthly single issues; which note makes me at least $200 poorer. The only complaint I have is that these comics are not released quick enough, I need bible sized issues released weekly! Basically if you like the show and enjoy reading you will LOVE this comic almost guaranteed.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I have recently become a fan of this series. I gave the rating because this series has a great ensemble cast and really good writing. I would recommend this series to anyone who is a fan of any shows like this one.
B005HSG3TC|3.0|OK for keeping your kindle safe and the stand might work. There's nothing to latch the case into the stand position, it just relies on friction. There's also nothing to keep the case closed....and on that point calling this a case is a bit of a stretch. It's more like a manila folder for your kindle but black.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Definitely not for the kids, but if you like to be scared it's great!  Set in an asylum in the 60's, it makes you wonder how terrible it really was for the mental patients then.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Range of ability tapped to play these games is good.  I really enjoyed playing this game.<br />Very good eye hand coordination to play many of these.  Thanks.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I hate to add or subtract or do any math for that matter without a calculator.  This one is great.
B008RA3X5E|1.0|I paid for the app and downloaded it.  Wanted to be able to play sleep music.  To do that I was &quot;promted&quot; to upgrade.  Now I cant use the app at all because it is stuck in a continuous &quot;must upgrade&quot; mode.  Not a good app for me.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|NCIS is one of my favorite shows. Season 10 of NCIS has really good writing and if the writing is good then each episode will be as well. I would recommend this to any fan of NCIS.
B009329Y30|4.0|Nothing out of the ordinary. Nicholas-Sparks kind of nice romance. Begins in a funny way with a guy taking pictures of girls on a beach and you know he's a cop. Oooo! Political mess up. Then it becomes a nice readable romance recipe.
B009186JYI|5.0|Intimate look at the young \\"innocent\\" Stones.  Want to see backstage Pepsi sipping instead of Jack Daniels chugging?  This film has it. An eerie prophecy is made by Brian Jones that in hindsight is very chilling. Listen closely, because this turns out to be a major part of this document. Songwriting sessions in the hotel room, private dining room dinners, train rides through the Irish countryside, whilst Keith Richards sings his favorite nursery rhymes?  Yeah, all that is here too.  What a wonderful film. You kinda feel like you really get to know them better after watching it.  This is a great piece of history for the person interested in knowing what were like before they became mega-stars.
0143121316|5.0|I rarely even look at books by politicians or celebrities. This well conceived and realized study by Kissinger was a worthwhile exception. The extended sketch of Chinese history which leads off the book  put the political/diplomatic study in excellent context
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Angry Birds ROCK!!!  Great app with no problems of any kind and great fun when you're at the doctor's office.  Just play.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|glitchy, full of bugs. many actions (anything bought within game) simply vanished upon closing app. made it to level 29 before app crashed. mlp needs some debugging. regretfully uninstalling :(
B0084I9QIW|4.0|A good DVD of MJ at the top of his game.  He was planning to return to London to do the &#34;This is It&#34; concerts.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I just could not put this book down. The characters were intriguing and well developed. The history was vivid and alive. I lost a lot of sleep because I just had to find out what was next. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys historical nonfiction.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|Really enjoyed the Matched series. Could not wait to start Crossed. So, good I stayed awake reading when I should have been asleep.
B009E3EY38|5.0|After a disappointing showing at the theater (was expecting surround sound) where the sound was only from the front and at a low enough volume to carry on a conversation at the beginning.  Although it was at a theater with a bunch of screening rooms, this one was isolated, so no excuse for the crappy sound.<br /><br />However these CD's sound much better, the sound on my 20yo home system is better than what was in the theater, studio quality for a live performance as I would have expected by going to the theater.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I love playing Angry Birds and this particular one is no exception to the rule.  Angry Birds Space is challenging and entertaining.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Great classic Holiday movie!  It's right up there with It's a Wonderful Life and A Christmas Story.  Gotta watch it every season!
B009RI4FRU|4.0|Good movie, however I could have done without the &#34;death of the dog&#34; scene and the &#34;coming of age/discovery&#34; scene was unnecessarily long.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|As a veteran &#34;phan&#34;, I cannot say much else about this rendition of PotO other than that I absolutely loved it! This production is just astonishing. Sets, costumes, those beloved old Victorian theater tricks they use... I can say that ever since I saw my first Phantom of the Opera at Her Majesty's in London when I was 14, I've loved this show... and this version does not disappoint. In all honesty, Sierra and Ramin have some of the best chemistry, not to mention voices, that I've seen and heard on stage, even though this wasn't &#34;on stage&#34;... ah, you know what I mean. Really, this is a must for any phan, and even if you're not an obsessed phan and enjoy fantastic music and lovely theater, you will fall in love with it too!
B0014D6PCO|4.0|It may not be the best batman movie, but is the movie that goes perfectly with the other 2 movies. Definitely a must watch.
B0034DGPEU|3.0|I was anxious to finish the book.  It did not hold my interest.  I found it a bit simplistic in the characters-too predictable as to how they would react to different situations,
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My granddaughter recommended I get this app and it is so addicting.  I get stuck at the 9x9's but it is a challenging game for all ages.
B007L6VR12|5.0|Moonrise Kingdom is a jewel of a movie.  The plot is unpredictable and entertaining.  The movie puts actors against type and the result is you are continually surprised and entertained.
B004IQ78HA|5.0|How could you NOT love this? I appreciate the old, hand-drawn style. Far warmer and more charming that CGI ever will be, no matter how far advanced it gets.
B008KW43TE|4.0|Ordered this cause super rich kids played on the weekend's Pandora channel !! Good cd ! My fave song is pink matter !
B005CKPQNE|5.0|It really brought people into the lives of the underground a way that had never been done before, I am not saying nothing was dramatized for television I am just say it is a glimpse that has never been brought forward in such a way before on a mass scale. well worth the watch but if you are going to do it start from the beginning or you will be lost.
B0097EWK3A|1.0|maybe it will work for anogther device. I cleared all my cache and it still don't work. I want to play please help
B00632HWOG|5.0|This works great for going and looking at my email accounts.  I have 2 accounts and it is simpler than using my computer!!
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Classic and still funny every time i watch it. Chevy Chase at the hight of his comedic genius. I can't imagine that anyone hasen't seen this movie, but if you haven't you should watch it ASAP!!!
B004R10L4S|5.0|Amazing story and superb acting by Naomi and Sean.  I would definitely recommend this movie as a must see.  Don't miss it!
B0084U0IEG|1.0|Not my cup of tea. I did not even finish this book. However, some of my friends consider Sweet Tooth a 5 star
B008D28HYS|5.0|CrossMe Color and it's sibling, CrossMe, are 2 of the best puzzle values around. I've long been a fan of the paper versions. The user interface is well thought out although there can be a lot of panning and zooming and fat fingers can be a problem. I have an 8&quot; tablet, larger would be better. I wouldn't suggest trying them on a phone.<br /><br />For me at least, CrossMe Color is a little easier than CrossMe because the colors provide additional clues. Some puzzles are harder to navigate, however because there tends to be more and shorter segments.<br /><br />There have been several updates to CrossMe Color since I installed it, adding additional puzzles at no additional charge. There are currently nearly 200 puzzles. (CrossMe currently has nearly 400.)
B008Z9L94O|5.0|Its a shame that people are unhappy with this reissue, my sympathy's go out to you all for waiting for all these years just to be let down. maybe my experience is different because of my equalizer granted \\"zero\\" could have been fine tuned a bit more, it was only slightly noticeable during the \\"godliness\\" part. idk i'm still going to give this 5 stars. This reissue took me right back to my childhood when i first listened to it. I found my self fulled with the same power and raw emotion this album offers. The remastering is superb, some may say it is over saturated with distortion or noise, i personally thing the remastering job accentuated this albums heaviness and beauty. I own an original 96 HUT pressing and the original is more superior sounding but this issue still captures what made this album spectacular. this is perfect for the pumpkin fan or vinyl collector who cant or refuses to pay that pretty penny. The packaging is beautiful and very well put together i do wish the box set opened like the cd version of this reissue but its not a deal breaker (just me being anal)
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I love playing Angry Birds and I have to say, this one is great.  It's challenging and I love the music from Star Wars.  5 stars.

B005HJWWW8|3.0|I'm not a professional when it comes to music but I would consider myself somewhat of an audiophile.  In saying this, I don't find that this amplifier really enhanced my listening experience, on any of the settings, whatsoever.  I am going to return it and just use my headphones for now which I like the sound of much better without this amplifier.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|I was excited to see this movie, so I rented it first. Then, it was just as unique and fun as I expected it would be, that I had to go buy it. Had a nice Independant film vibe, much like the other great movies by this writter/director.

0525952926|5.0|I have read both of the books in the trilogy to date.  Excellent, easy to read historial novel.  These books put both WWI and WWII on a very human scale and I felt like I was living with these families--sharing their joys and sorrows.  Can't wait for book number 3!!

B0072GPQNG|5.0|I loved the movie.  It should have gotten something at Oscar time, if only for cinematography.  A beautiful, highly watchable movie with a great story, great characters & realistic war scenes.  A winner.

B0050DIWFC|4.0|I thought it was well written. You dig deep down emotionally being a parent and how you would handle this situation. I enjoyed reading it  and have suggested it to others.
B003UYUR0G|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie, buy it.  We had friends recommend it to us and we thrilled with the quality and the acting.
B0007939NO|5.0|Love to watch musicals.  Singing and dancing is great in this movie Great to watch when then is nothing on tv.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|When a story is weak, it drags everything down with it. This is a story that goes round and round in circles overburdened with boring chase sequences that go on much too long. What a shame, considering the talent involved in creating it.  The humorous voices, the spectacular landscapes and gifted animation were, in the end, not enough to buoy up a plot line so leaden, it put a drag on everything. Even the heroine seemed a little selfish for not taking responsibility for her wish-gone-horribly wrong, until close to the end. What makes a story not gel? Lack of nuance maybe? A need for plenty of chases as filler for a thin narrative?  I wanted to like this movie about a spirited, pretty girl with flaming red hair, but bears took over and brought it to the dark side for most of the picture.  I'm fine with a more politically correct, less pink or frilly or classic princess meets prince plot, but exactly what was this?  Ok, this is also about a product. Would I buy this dvd?  Sure!  With the handy FF button I can watch the sequences I like and shoot past the ones I don't.  This film has enough that's satisfying on separate levels that one can overlook the weak plot.  Sometimes first impressions get overshadowed by what is working well in subsequent viewings.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|Wow a real nice app, grandkids love it and It relaxes me after a stressful day, keep up the good work
B001NLKZUA|3.0|Oh City of Ashes, where do I begin? I wanted to really like these books, given the hype--and now movie--surrounding these things. Instead I just read and sighed at the missed opportunities. They are engrossing, and by far not the worst thing I have ever read, that honor goes to another fanfic alumna and her wonderful tales of Grey, but I feel like these could have been so much better than what they are. Or perhaps my expectations are too high for a book in the YA genre.<br /><br />The book starts off where the last one left off. Big bad V is still on the loose and it's up to our ragtag group of super-powered teenagers to save the day.<br /><br />I didn't have a problem with Jace in the last book, but he starts off in this one terrible and only gets worse until he suddenly shapes up towards the middle of the book, in which Clary immediately picks up the slack and becomes an even more annoying version of herself. I get it, she's a normal girl in a big bad supernatural world, but that was only cute in the first book. By now she should have known better, instead she still rushes in head first without being prepared a majority of the time or bothering to learn how to at least defend herself given the resources at her disposal. But I suppose that's what Jace and Simon are there for.<br /><br />The love triangle in these books is poorly handled at beast. Simon is the Xander to Clary's Buffy, and we all know how well that one went. There was never any chemistry there to make that match even remotely believable, but at least it wasn't as bile inducing as the other match. Every time Clary and Jace had a scene together, I could hear the banjo music creeping in. The incest is so in your face about it, that by the end you hope the two just pack up their bags, move to Alabama, and get it over with. Gross. There were so many other methods the author could have used to add the required teenaged angst, most of which don't make me want to throw up or imagine these two on Jerry Springer someday. It's unnecessary and not hot. AT ALL.<br /><br />And for that matter, am I the only one that thought it was creepy that Magnus Bane was hitting on a teenaged boy? Kudos that they're gay and all, that's awesome, but the whole age thing seems a little too Twilight-y to me.<br /><br />Anyways, there were a lot of other things in this book that didn't make sense to me. One of which is the failing of the Clave to send the necessary troops to help secure a city as big as Manhattan. Why was the city's fate left to teenagers in the first place? I could see if this were a smaller city, but Manhattan? Especially since their enemy number one was spotted yachting in the East River. Also, with Clary's newfound rune ability, there was a missed opportunity for some real awesomeness. Like instead of a fearless rune, why not make a rune that would give the wearer diamond skin, or something at least a little more useful than giving an arrogant character no fear whatsoever, something we are told time and again he has anyways.<br /><br />The book was a soap opera-y as ever, the prose just as purple, and the speeches just as overly grandiose, but at least the author lightened up on the similes and metaphors. They weren't nearly as painful as in the first book. No one ever really dies or suffers for that long, and it's predictable as all get out. Having said that, I will still read the third book just to see how this all ends. But I think I know how it will all go anyways...
B008458O3S|5.0|This game is so addictive and fun!  it can get frustrating (for me) at times but I kept at it and finally solved some hard ones.  It gives no hints so you have to keep plugging away.  I highly recommend this game
B002XTBE6K|5.0|This is by far the best production of &#34;Emma.&#34;  We enjoyed the acting as it was very believable.  Excellent purchase.
B004DLPXAO|2.0|The android app is much easier to use. After a few weeks trial I dumped kindle and use only the epub android system. I don't buy books but only get library books on my tablet.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|OK, let's get the criticisms out of the way.<br />Not enough of Jeremy Renner's Clint Barton/Hawkeye.<br />If you're a guy, not enough of Cobie Smulders' Maria Hill (My goodness, that catsuit...it actually has made me pay more attention to \\"How I Met Your Mother\\"...).<br />Got it??!?  Because those are about the ONLY complaints there are here.<br />Simply put--the climax of Marvel Studios' Phase I Series got it right.  But honestly, the whole series--the two Iron Man movies, The Incredible Hulk, Thor, and Captain America: The First Avenger--set a great path to this movie.  It stayed true to the essence of the Marvel Universe, which has always dealt with their heroes and their character quirks--humanized their super-humans.  This movie threw together the crew and their quirks--Tony Stark and his general lack of humility, Thor and his imperiousness, Steve Rogers dealing with being out of his time, Bruce Banner and his issues of anger management,and Nick Fury, simultaneously manipulating and cajoling the different individuals to work together.<br />Yet, because Joss Whedon was the writer/director, I wasn't very surprised to see that Joss drew liberally from his \\"Buffy The Vampire Slayer\\" years, especially when it came to the expansion of Scarlett Johannsen's Natasha Romanoff from where she was in \\"Iron Man II\\".  The Black Widow ends up being much more complicated, world weary and vulnerable--giving much depth to her thoughts about having \\"red on her ledger\\", and the point that she is truly fearful of Dr. Banner's Other Self.  But ScarJo also ends up with those brilliant throwaway lines during the battle for New York that were also so typically Whedon.<br />Performance-wise, no one slacks off.  Robert Downey Jr. still embodies all of Tony Stark's brio and ego.  Chris Evans gives that sense of traditional heroism and loneliness to Steve Rogers.  Chris Hemsworth tones down Thor a little from the movie, but the \\"he's adopted\\" line--which caused a bit of a minor stir afterthe release--is timed out perfectly.  Samuel L. Jackson finally sees expanded time in this series as Nick Fury.  Much has been made of Mark Ruffalo's turn as Banner, and it's pitch-perfect.  Mark plays Banner with a little bit of a smile, but certainly knowing what lies beneath himself.  Clark Gregg's Phil Coulson cannot be forgotten--as we've seen in the \\"Marvel One-Shot\\" episodes that have accompanied the Blu-Ray/DVD releases, Coulson has been a straight man for many of the hijinks of both SHIELD and the heroes.  Seeing him suddenly turn into the gushing fanboy of Captain America ends up being rather charming.<br />The show-stealer in all this--and again, given the director this shouldn't be much of a surprise--is Tom Hiddleston's Loki.  Again, this goes back to the \\"Buffyverse\\" with Whedon.  Frequently, the \\"Big Bad\\" during the seven seasons that series ran was an over-the-top destroyer with a smirk.  Hiddleston played Loki in \\"Thor\\" more as an Agent Provocateur in Kenneth Branagh's eyes.  Whedon takes Loki to the level of Angelus or the Mayor of Sunnydale...but also mixes in some Wile E. Coyote, especially in the \\"Destruction of Manhattan\\"--Loki catching Hawkeye's arrow as if it wasn't a big deal, only to have the arrow expode, knocking Loki off the Skycycle only to be caught by the Hulk, leading to Loki's verbal assault, leading to...well--the best scene of all the summer pictures...<br />Overall--Marvel Studios and Paramount did right with Phase 1, and the culmination is on the short list of The Most Entertaining Movies of 2012.  Certainly, \\"The Avengers\\" is also in the room as being The Most Fun Superhero Movie Ever.<br />So, let Phase II begin....HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
0547884591|5.0|I originally pre-ordered it before Christmas LAST year (not knowing it wasn't set for release until a year later). Anyway, I had The 4-Hour Body book and loved it, and also love cooking and gathering cook books, so this seemed like the perfect pairing. When I received the book last week I was pleasantly surprised to find that all the recipes are Slow Carb-friendly. In addition to the great recipes that are compatible with my diet, there's also the fact that the level of difficulty can scale up to my needs. So I can get as \\"fancy\\" or down home as I want.<br /><br />I also like that the book teaches you how to learn any skill in the guise of learning cooking. Couldn't think of a better way. Like Tim points out when talking about learning languages, one of the things that helped him was reading native books on subjects he liked (i.e. Judo), and, in that way, helped me learn the \\"foreign language\\" of cooking.<br /><br />Job well done, Tim!
B004LROMQG|5.0|I love this series.  I have all the seasons which are out on DVD.  I hope they are continuing this series and, if so, wish it would start soon.  My daughter borrowed my entire collection and loved it, too.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Very enjoyable but not always clear if the tiles can slide or not.  My daughter who is 10 loves this game.
B003UESJFG|5.0|My children love this movie.  They play it at least once a week and laugh every single time.  Some people underestimate Dreamworks production but this is a fun movie.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|The graphics are well done, and the puzzles are challenging.  The hints provided are robust enough to get you moving when stuck.
B007Q0OV6Q|4.0|The calendar begins on December 1st, but Advent actually began on December 2.  The box is sturdy and has a &#34;floor&#34; where you can display your assembled figures.

B006LSZECO|4.0|While it was slow to start, the story picked up in the middle and kept you guessing until the end. The format of the narrative keeps you thinking and wanting to reading to the next episode. A worthwhile read
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|It was really fun but then after a while it started fore closing every 5 seconds so i couldn't play it. I would give it 5 stars if glitches was fixed.
B008DM4OTA|4.0|My daughter is sick today so this was the perfect FAOTD. The only thing I don't like is the app doesn't keep your phone from going to sleep. If this changes, I'll give 5 stars.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Delivers again! Fast paced action packed book that has you turning the pages (hitting the page advance button). Vince could write a dictionary that would be a good read.
1609611543|2.0|I am old. I have seen lot of popular diets come and go, alot of foods and food groups labeled as \\"poison\\", alot of diets as horrible, and generally many changes in what \\"experts\\" think that we should eat to make us healthy, wheat being the new \\"bad boy\\". Guys, many foods cause allergies. Many people are allergic to wheat or to tomatoes, or are lactose intolerant, or are allergic to seafood or peanuts. Discover what foods are difficult for you and avoid them. If you do not wish to be fat, do not eat too much. Be physical everyday-play games, dance,make love-walking instead of getting in your car is a fabulous idea for those shorter trips. Eat all food groups in moderation, focusing on fruits and veggies and whole grains but do eat meat or fish or fowl a few times a week. Try not to preach to others about what they should eat. If you must, remain logical and check your facts again and again. Remember, no one actually likes the food police. Do not make food an enemy- we need it and we love it. Eat what makes your body happy and function the best but please remember that we are all different. Just because i HATE licorice, does not mean that i must scream about its evils to everyone else. Go in peace, Licorice, or meat, or citrus, or corn or wheat...Basically, i am just grateful that the universe has offered us so many delightful foods.......

0071390111|5.0|Having only read the 4th edition last year I was eager to see the newly updated version. It is bigger and better, with excellent photographs and charts and far greater detail than in the past. It's very readable as well, partly because there is enough repetition of these difficult concepts to make them understandable.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I'm not one to read books. In fact I could probably count on two hands how many books I've actually read I'm my life. But this book captured me completely. Strong work SEAL Team 6. Stay safe

B004J4WNL2|4.0|This is a well-done and interesting book, and is particularly helpful to people who are either introverts themselves, or have introverted children or manage introverts in an office. Cain is right in that much of worklife is structured for extroverts and is not conducive to the in-depth thought and consideration that is required for problem-solving and breakthroughs. This is a pressing problem, not just on an individual level, but also on an economic one.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|This is a fun and engaging Veterinarian game.  My 3 year old daughter loves it because she gets to take care of different sick animals and make them all better.  There are no ads or advertisement either so I highly recommend it for 10 and under.

B008673ZAQ|4.0|Reflected in You is the second book in the Crossfire Trilogy.  It leaves off where Bared to You ended and finishes with the reader eagerly anticipating the release of the third book.

B008Z9L94O|1.0|When you spend upwards of $80 on an album you would expect it to sound great and for the most part it does but one GLARING issue.  Zero is full of static and ruins the whole set.  I have a quality turntable and a really good stylus and I hope it's a pressing issue and not a remaster issue.  I have requested a refund and I'm very disappointed after years of waiting for this set.

B006S053K8|4.0|I am a big Jessie Eisenberg fan, and had never heard of this movie. So I got it because people told me it was hilarious. They were not wrong, but they failed to mention that it's mainly a boy chases girl movie. That's doesn't make it awful or anything, but, for me, it takes away from some of the comedy.

1594481717|5.0|I purchased multiple copes of this book and distributed it to all our employees. Gives a great insight of what is needed for forward thinking in a world that has leading edge technology as a standard for our newer generation. A new way to move forward with a different frame of mind. We don't need to follow the thinking of forefathers who created what we know as 'normal' today! Easy read, not hard to follow and I recommend to High School Juniors/Seniors before they choose what they would like to do with their future!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Can't wait for the movie to come out. I can't believe that it was this good. You need to get the entire series.

B009S8PEHY|4.0|I was looking for a new Christmas album and saw that Rod had one out.  My first thought was &#34;Gee, I am sure this will be another one of those mediocre Christmas albums from someone trying to keep the flame alive.&#34;  But, curiosity got the better of me so I took a quick listen to this album, knowing that I wouldn't like it.  Boy, was I ever wrong!  Not sure if it's Rod I like (I have always loved his voice) or if it's the the duets on the album (Mary J. Blige, Michael Buble, Cee Lo and Ella Fitzgerald - All NICE!), but if you like Rod Stewart, you will Love this album.  Give it a quick listen.  I liked it so much that I had to download it.  You might, too.

1594484805|4.0|In our efforts to motivate and control behavior,  we underestimate the power of intrinsic motivation. In his book \\"Drive,\\" Daniel Pink shares his ideas about intrinsic motivation, complete with many tips for how you can apply the knowledge. I read this book from the perspective of an artist and an educator, and I learned many things that are applicable to both areas.<br />As an educator, or a leader of any sort, you need to be selective about what types of praise you give to your students. Before learning the theories and research in Drive, I did not see any problem with giving praise like, \\"Wow, you are so smart!\\" But, the text explains that this can cause children to  they need to avoid new challenges in the future so that aren't tested to see whether they are actually smart or not. Pink offers a better way to give praise.<br />Although many of his ideas and suggestions are directed towards the corporate world, they can be applied in many different situations. I would recommend this book to anyone.

B000PDYVVG|5.0|As I was reading, I was constantly think that a movie could not do this story justice. So much in the telling was in her mind, not actions, so I'm glad I read it & didn't bother with the movie.
B004GTKP3S|2.0|After thoroughly enjoying the first Cranford with all its charm and appeal, this subsequent series was a great disappointment.  With its splendid pedigree of actors retained, there is no lack of effort on their part but even the excellent cast cannot not fix a script/direction that is sorely lacking in most all aspects and one which renders every situation as contrived and insipid. It would have been wonderful to experience a continuation of all the heartwarming aspects of the first series but this particular rendition falls dismally short.

B005LAIHXQ|4.0|When I saw this movie previewed, I wondered if it was a prequel to \\"Alien\\".  Even though hype suggested otherwise, I knew that there were too many clues indicating that it was.  Since \\"Aliens\\" is my favorite movie of all time, I'm obviously biased - That can either work against this movie or for it.  In this case, the movie proved itself worthy, & I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Although I could give a detailed analysis of the characters, etc., I'll keep this part short & to the point.  \\"Prometheus\\" effectively combines science & philosophy with action & atmosphere. The characters are believable & relatable, & their personal evolution reflects the storyline's premise:  who are we?<br /><br />Mythologically, Prometheus was an immortal who gave fire to man & was subsequently persecuted for it by the gods.  Restrained to a rock, he suffered an unending ritual that allowed an eagle to eat his liver; every night his liver regenerated only to be eaten again the next day.  An immortal suffering for us . . . sound familiar?<br /><br />The way you choose to view this is dependent on your primary philosophy.  I find it interesting that (in the case of this film) these beings essentially provided the building blocks of our lives & then were equally ready to destroy us, essentially playing God.  Yet, it was ultimately out of their control, resulting in consequences they had not intended.  To whom do they answer for their indiscretions?  Or is it as simple as life finding its way  . . . ?
145210655X|5.0|This will be the perfect stocking stuffer for my husband. It's so hilarious! I'd love to see more books like this.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|A very light hearted book that I enjoyed.  I think you do need to be in the right mood to read it.  It's beyond credulity which is what makes it so fun.
B00140PK6O|5.0|With all of its delightful charm, Cranford is a look into an era gone by that many of us might wished to have experienced. Excellent casting and direction puts us on the streets and in the homes of Cranford's much-loved residents. Sadly, I recommend you skip the sequel, Return to Cranford, as it lacks all of the fine qualities the first Cranford may boast.
B000002JNJ|5.0|Dimebag guitar playing,One the heavy and fast guitar playing.If you play guitar get this cd and learn some of the songs to play along with the cd.
1594744769|5.0|My mother has asked me to get this book for her, but I ended up reading it. It was very interesting and I did enjoy it.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a really great work out! Jillian will kick your butt! I have always been skeptical of DVD work outs but this one is really great- you can do a quick 20 minute work out and still feel the 'burn' hours later!
B009GX7IRA|5.0|This is a excellent show and I never miss a episode.<br />Abby rocks and is my favorite character  my five year olds too
B0081SRJSY|4.0|Fun for kids or adults.  Games are fast -- only a few minutes -- so easy to find a stopping place.  The sounds/commentary is annoying so we keep the sound turned off.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Great game!I would recommend this game . Funny noises and creatures. Great game to make you laugh when you are having a hard day!
B001AP11L6|5.0|Jack white's guitar sounds so heavy and distorted,great sound & great lyics.If you play guitar,you would like to listen to this cd.
B00684J49U|5.0|It's always sad when established actors leave a series - this season had it's share of losses.  But it's still a good series.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This is a great game. Kids can also play which is a plus. Very addictive. I love it! Definately reccomend it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|For those who love good romance with a twist.... this is for you.  You have to read all three to get the story and it is worth it.
B008QDCZJ2|3.0|I would describe this as PSB's by numbers. I have the 2 disc edition and the instrumental versions are great. That saves this release from being so-so.
B0088P2A7A|2.0|I attempted to use this on my Kindle Fire and it didn't work efficiently.  Easier to use the web version.
B009NPM5Y2|5.0|ROCK ON!!!!!! Great songs, I love Julianne Hough, and Tom Cruise, well he is Tom Cruise, after all. Diego<br />Boneta did a great job, too.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app lets me know in an easy to understand way about my battery use left for my Kindle Fire! Thank you!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Played first time when getting car serviced and could not wait to get refills...better than the actual thing, just no money back ... LOL
B002MQYOFW|5.0|You must read it.  It is not just for teenagers but brings you into a world that shows just how hard times get and what some folks will do to survive.
B003IY48PS|4.0|This movie is not for anyone who is looking for a hardcore horror movie.<br />It is very old and a little stupid at times, but that is the charm of it. It is the most serious out of the trilogy, but that is its worst feature I think. Bad acting and effects add to the badness of it.<br /><br />But the movie is somehow fantastic anyway. I might be saying that since I haven't seen it for well over 10 years, so nostalgia and childhood memories could be factored into my opinion.<br /><br />So bottomline is, if you like old horror movies and don't judge movies critically, pick it up; if you're into more modern horror movies, then stay away.
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|I love this movies and sound traks. One of the best! Never get tired of listening to it. I ordered both the movie and the sound trak.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is my favorite game to play, it is addictive and I love to play it - great for those long waiting lines.
B005S9EJ46|5.0|This is the story of life at a certain age told with compassionate introspection, gentleness and humor. In scene after scene, the camera is your surrogate as witness of life's pace, emotions and colors. One can imagine the smells which accompany the images and sounds. It is that well done. Then, the cast. Rarely, in any story, is there opprtunity to display this much talent.<br />This movie is not action, flash, vulgar or shallow. It other words it won't entertain one's purient nature. In fact, it does not entertain at all. Rather, it invites you in as a silent witness to what people's lives are like when those lives become bittersweet. In doing so, your emotions will not leave you saddened. They will leave you uplifted with the warmth only a seasoned love for life can bring. Do yourself a favor, do not miss experiencing The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel because in the end, everything will be good. And, if it is not good; it is not the end.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I had assumed that the show would begin to get boring due to the nature of the theme. The show continues to evolve and like other great shows it isn't shy about killing off main characters, everyone has flaws and strengths.
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|My favorite group and the best songs.  Fun and entertaining.  I have played it almost weekly and never tire of it.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|As always, Dexter keeps you on the edge of your seat! Even my friend, who hadn't seen any of the other seasons, was able to pick IP the story line quickly and she's now totally addicted. :)
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I had heard a lot of good things about this movie. I found that they were all true. Thank you!
0345803485|5.0|Buyer beware, this is porn under the guise of literature.  This is an investment for me that will pay off tonight.
0062202081|5.0|Gave this book to my granddaughter instead of candy on Halloween and she was, and is, enjoying every page.  She has been his biggest fan since day one.  Saw  him in person at a concert and thinks he is one talented and handsome guy.  So happy I found this on line, such an easy way to shop.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Read all three books. Loved all three. I hope she writes more from Christian's point of view. I love these books.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great love story and you have to read all 3 to get the character insight.  Read it and love it as I did.
B005HJWWW8|4.0|For the price this is an excellent product.<br /><br />This is a good introduction to good sound if you plan to make this a hobby.<br /><br />I would highly suggest you getting an amp for your headphones cause you aren't doing yourself any justice if you do not.<br /><br />I have a pair of beats solo and 419 Sennheisers and they make it the sound amazing and sound 2 times better.  I look forward to investing in more higher-end amp and headphones.
B0053O89WY|5.0|I absolutely love everything about this series! It's witty, funny & smart! This series gets two thumbs up from me!
B0097GVJWQ|3.0|It is fun and though it drags a bit it is worth playing.  The cut scenes last forever. But the hint and skip buttons charge quickly.
B008602KQI|4.0|the movie was good if you had not read the books first.  certain castings were very odd to me (like Woody Harrelson??) but if you had npt read the books first, you will enjoy this movie!
0374214913|1.0|After considerable praise I was quite excited to sit down with this book and get lost in its world.  One hundred pages with more than 2/3rd of the way to finish the book I was thoroughly dreading finishing this book.  Let me say, I love stories about secret societies but when there is no danger in exposing the mystery of a secret society (the only threat is potential legal action from the secret society's army of lawyers, oooh, scary), there is absolutely no stakes in finding out the mystery of the puzzle and it loses any compelling device to keep the reader interested.<br /><br />Has literature sunk so low that this poorly written story garners such praise? Where can I begin to list its multiple failures - two dimensional characters (the girlfriend is HOT and SMART, need I say more?), uninteresting prose and a rather banal story.  I have twenty more pages to go in this book, it's been over a week and I still can't think of one convincing reason to finish this book.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Let's me keep up with my email when I travel so I can keep my mailbox from overflowing ...works well.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|I'm an ancient history buff since childhood. Rome is my expertize. Although some of the events were pure fiction, I think that these dramatic inventions were both compelling and ultimately forgivable! Bravo!
B006LSZECO|4.0|The characters were a little too bizarre to be completely believable but the story was interesting enough to keep me reading.
B000H8SFMK|3.0|i only bought this for one song but enjoy the album for the most part.  they have songs that sound like several different musical types which keeps things interesting but i was more looking for a classic Irish beat.
B002OUTIOI|5.0|You can't beat the quality and the enjoyment of this CD. Mika is an amazing talent and everyone should be familiar with his music.
B008602KQI|5.0|I love that it did not stray much from the books.  I love the story and the whole set of books ...the movie does not disappoint.
B009FZFONO|5.0|After a dissapointing season 2 for the walking dead, season 3 really ramps up the story.  While season 2 seemed to linger and plot lines seemed to go nowhere, so far in season 3 you actually have things happening!  The midseason finale is a pretty nice cliff hanger as well.
B000YDI9UG|5.0|I absolutely love these boots. I just wished I had gotten a smaller size. I wear a 11.5 when it comes to Nike sport shoes but for timberland boots I'm more of a 10 - 10.5.
B0002858YS|3.0|I only bought this album for two songs and didn't really connect with any of the other songs on here.
B006P4FBUE|3.0|The keyboard is fun to play with,  although it is only 1 octave.  I have found the response to be slow on my Kindle Fire.
B002BWP49C|5.0|Not for everyone but if you read the books you need to watch the movies to see how fun it can be.
B00A2XU9IS|5.0|I got this for my grandkids. they love it. The big kids love it also. I would recommend it highly.
B00333NCTM|4.0|I am an avid non-fiction reader and decided to take a break between &#34;serious&#34; books to read something hopefully entertaining.  I read reviews on some of the rock biographies out there and settled on Ozzy's book.  I found it hugely entertaining.  At times I laughed out loud on the plane and had to put the kindle down for fear that people would think I was insane.  The book isn't for everyone, of course, but if you are purchasing a book by Ozzy you should know it will be &#34;a little out there.&#34;<br /><br />I also was surprised to learn that the original members of Black Sabbath along with Robert Plant and John Bohnam all grew up and went to high school fairly close to each other.  What a tremendous amount of talent in that neighborhood!<br /><br />Buy it, read it, laugh about it and marvel on just how the hell this guy has managed to become the icon he has.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|i am a huge Mumford & sons fan after buying this album!  i will buy every album that they come out with from here on out!  they have such a unique sound and style and i loved all the shakespearean and Odyssey references in their songs!  a breath of fresh air and a great album to play from begin to end and back again!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This game is a lot different than Angry Birds and I Love it. The puzzles are fun and almost too challenging. all I ask for is more levels. I have gotten 3 stars on all levels available. except the sandbox levels I have all 20stars.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|For those who love good romance with a twist.... this is for you.  You have to read all three to get the story and it is worth it
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I think this game is a great app. This is a classic game and I play it often to pass the time.
B009GED3HS|5.0|Consistent laughs.<br />Silly laughs, commiserating laughs, smart laughs, and roll-your-eyes-I-can't-believe-they-made-me-laugh-at-that laughs.<br /><br />If you are felling laugh deficient, this show will top off your funny bone.
B008NW67E0|5.0|I am so addicted to Mumford & Sons and LOVE this new album.  I am not a fan when a music group keeps putting out albums that sound just like the one before and they definitely did not do this!  this is so different yet as comfortnig as the first album.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Allows you to open up the camera mode that is not available normally on the Kindle Fire HD. It also allows you to easily access files that you downloaded.
B004OXCL5Q|1.0|I received the movie; and it would not play in my blu-ray player.  A message  appeared saying it would not play in this region.  I had no idea what this meant.  I only know the movie would not play.  I returned it on 11/23/12; and as of today have heard nothing back.  I'm now reluctant to purchase any more blu-ray movies from Amazon.  I hope this matter will ultimately be resolved.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I use facebook frequently to communicate with others and I have been using this app and its easy to navigate.
B0096HI226|3.0|Fun movie, had a little bit of everything for everyone - comedy, romance and action. The eye candy did not disappoint!
0143118420|5.0|i read this book when i was going through so changes in my life and i truly connected with this book.  a great book for everyone whether you are going through a major life event or not.
B006RXQ2CY|4.0|The Queen...Outstanding performance by Helen Mirren.  The subject matter surrounding the Royal Family's relationship with Dianna post divorce, was an interesting historical perspective and made me want to do some further reading/research..
B009A9EQL6|5.0|Aerosmith  rocks as good a album as toys in the attic. Get it and crank it up and enjoy it
B009K45Y62|4.0|This is a good movie. Its hard for me to say \\"great movie\\" because it just isn't, but it doesn't take anything away from the overall experience. There are some major plot holes that never get answered and I feel like the pacing of the movie felt rushed like we were tripping over events just to get to the end even though its another 3 hour journey into Gotham. First we start off with Bane escaping capture and then like 15 minutes later, he already has an army of men underneath the city working on stuff. And Batman's identity being solved so easily was a bit lame to me. Oh because the man scowls he MUST be Batman. If John Blake had linked Batman's disappearance and Bruce Wayne's isolation together then maybe I wouldn't be as upset about that bit. But before I go on further with what is wrong with the movie, the movie does a good job of tying all of the loose ends together and establishing a future for the series whoever decides to try their hand at keeping the Bat-machine churning money hand over fist.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|great, as good as the first! finished in a matter of days. interesting twists that made you want to keep reading
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|After the last update the game won't open at all.  This was disappointing as it is the only game I even dabble in.
0547884591|5.0|As the book implies, \\"A Simple Path to Learning\\" anything.  Tim definitely did a great job with his new book. It is a GREAT companion to its predecessor, \\"The 4-Hour Body,\\" as it is filled with a plethora of Slow-Carb recipes.  And if your anything like me, limited  on time and cooking skills, it breaks the process down easily from Prep work to Clean up.  As Tim says throughout the book, he is using cooking and food as his \\"medium\\" for the process he uses to learn.  Overall I feel that his book plays like a case study, which if you have read \\"The 4-Hour Workweek\\", are invaluable sources of information when applied correctly (emphasis on applied correctly).  To sum it all up, \\"The 4-Hour Chef\\" is an excellent read, with lots of great applicable content, and (along with this other books) creates a great series on lifestyle enhancement.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The story, the dialogue and the suspence are all there. I never read a book as fast as I did this one. I was hooked on the first page.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Simply put: this is a well crafted blu ray boxset. My wife was disappointed because we got rid of a lot of her DVDs a few years ago, one of those being her Indiana Jones trilogy boxset. As soon as I heard this set was available for pre-order, I hopped all over it. Of course, Amazon, being as awesome as it always is, the price started out high, but dropped quite a bit when it was finally released. I received the movies the same day they were in stores and couldn't be happier.
B005EGXTL2|2.0|i loved the other 2 books. i read them in a matter of days but this book was long winded and dragged on. the worst part was the ending. i don't want to ruin it for you but i thought it was soooo depressing!
B0014D6PCO|5.0|All of these Batman movies are excellent - well done and great story line.  Enjoyed watching with my teens!  Amazon streaming worked great, as well.
B001KQEA5E|5.0|Snoops first album; got played so much it got played out, but have missed hearing some of the cuts over time so broke down and picked it up.  Listening now reminds me of an &#34;era&#34; seemingly long gone now...have times changed that much or is it just me? lol  But IMHO, this is and was some of his best work!
1609611543|5.0|While reading the book I changed my eating habits and I started losing pounds right away. I bought 3 other books to give away for the Holidays as I think it can save poeple from a lot of grief over their weight management, their health and happiness.<br />Dr Davis did a great job of putting it all together and he provides all the references and research to back up what he writes.<br />Thank you.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|Hard to read. Can't really get into it. Probably would be better understood in its original language is I only spoke French.
0241952875|4.0|I usually don't read too many mystery books but this story was very thought provoking. I always like how they tie up the loose ends of the plot in the end so there isn't a cliffhanger. This is truly a classic.
B009FZHYKU|2.0|I'm very disappointed in Walking Dead, season 3.  I have, at this point, given up on the series, and I will wait for it to come out on DVD at the end of the season.  I can appreciate the need for splitting the attention between two groups.  There are, after all, only so many different ways to present life after the Zombie Apocalypse, but I'm getting the impression of no forward movement to speak of, in spite of the different groups.  I'm also finding no sympathic characters this time around, which makes it difficult to care about what happens to who.<br /><br />Hopefully the series will prove me totally wrong on all this, and it will work out. I have enjoyed the series the first two years.
1615470158|5.0|I can't say much more about this book that hasn't been said here or on other blog reviews.<br /><br />It's a very good book for getting started with PowerPivot if you have never used it before.  If you have some PowerPivot experience, but are mostly self taught from blogs and other random sources, then this is a good book to help \\"fill in the cracks\\" and consolidate what you already know.<br /><br />I have read many technical books over the years on everything from Access to Excel to SQL Server to SharePoint...etc.  While many have been good, I don't know that I would classify any as \\"page turners\\".  This book is as close as a technical book can get.  Rob has a unique writing style which he has been demonstrating on his blog for several years now.  He is gifted at explaining very techinal issues in an easy to follow and engaging manner.  One example flows to the next as does each chapter.  It doesn't get bogged down in technical details but gives a solid explanation of real world examples.<br /><br />I can see myself referencing this for years to come.<br /><br />I will be recommending this to everyone on my team as well as others throughout my company that show an interest in PowerPivot.
B000EWBKLC|5.0|I have heard rumors that the blu ray was supposed to be the rated r version but there was a mishap and the unrated version got put on all blu rays. Is this true? or did they not release a blu ray U.S. unrated version on blu ray?
B008OOYALE|5.0|if I were to rate this from 1 to 10, id absolutely givd a ten! this game is so addicting!!! I have a bunch of dragons, and I just cant stop!!!!
B00A6I87UQ|1.0|I tried to load this on three different versions of the Kindle application:<br /><br />  iPad<br />  Windows 7<br />  Windows 8 (on a Samsung Slate and a laptop)<br /><br />Not supported on all three. Assume it works on a Kindle device.<br /><br />Refund was easy, but took a little looking around on the Amazon site to figure it how to return a digital order.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|An emotional ride for sure. Written from a spot on teenager's viewpoint, this book is humorous at times, thought provoking and deeply moving. I'm well past my teen years and still enjoyed this book.
B004HW7JH4|5.0|An excellent season but much too short.<br />My only concern is how long it took for it to become available.
B0057LUI0O|3.0|I thought the movie was visually beautiful and the story line was entertaining.  I would recommend the movie for children.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Great Book. It gave me another insight on the how polarization in politics can lead to extremism. We need to have a vaild central voice, neither Conservative or Liberal.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|Well, it's much more disturbing than last season.  Has the heart going most of the time.  As the episodes go on it gets more and more addicting.  I have FX channel but can't stay up that late.  I don't think I would want to watch it before bed anyway.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|Nobody plays somebody else, living or dead, like Josh Brolin.  Playing a younger version of the same character in the same movie?  No problem.  If you liked the other Men In Black movies this one is a sure thing.  It's fun, kooky, and goes to great lengths to explain the premise of the first two movies.  See it if you like MIB.  See it if you have no prior knowledge of the series but want to be entertained by creepy aliens and straight shooting good guys...in black.
B009ZE27US|3.0|Although this app is inaccurate I still found it really fun :).<br /><br />It told me I was we years older than I am. The closest it got to my age was ehen it said I was 19.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|My favorite part is that there is a wide range of difficulties, so it allows learners to take it slow. I'm not a chess expert, but the strategies that the AI uses seem pretty solid. Another plus is that it has an undo button, which again is great for learners.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I choose amazon MP3 because I have an andriod and I love the choice amazon have and the music is reasonable price and it was very easy to download to my andriod.
B0055S348W|1.0|works fine on my kindle if I'm  not printing txt. files , excel files or word files. stoped rendering these files when I up dated app months ago.  up dated again, still nothing. What a waste of $12.95
B0091REZMW|4.0|I really like the game, but I don't like the fact you have to purchase other things to get into the room.
B0076DEJMO|4.0|As usual the author doesn''t dissapoint. Great internal and external dialogue. Great story, descriptions. I look forward to more books in this vein.
1609611543|3.0|Some good gluten- and wheat-free recipes. Don't know of another book  that includes so many.Could do without the windy explanation, since I already know I have a problem.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|This is a great movie to show you what it's like to live a life more important than your own.<br />These men are without a doubt the bravest men out there.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|Ian Mcewan is such a wonderful writer and I love the era this was written about.  He captures it perfectly and I really<br />didn't want the book to end.  Books like this are difficult to find -- they're jewels.
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|I have read all of the other English-translated Hole novels in the sequence of their release, and loved them all, but in my opinion this is the best of the series thus far.  It is tight, well written, and has lots of the usual Jo Nesbo twists and turns.  A compelling read.
B003EY62II|1.0|This movie cannot be described as anything but garbage. It's not even worth describing all that is wrong with it. Don't waste your time reading any more reviews. Just find something else.
B00006FM77|5.0|This live is amazing!<br />the sound is perfect (much bettre than &#34;Live in 75&#34;)<br />the guitar of Terry Kath is great<br />Before, i only knew the Chicago of 80's that i did'nt like so much<br />Now, il know the real one
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I watched the movie first and..... wow this was an amazing book. So hard to put down, I was even dreaming about it.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Totally worth every penny, never gets old. I catch jokes the third time around that i never even hear the first time.
0783233477|5.0|Here is a young Brad Pitt, but that is not what makes the story.  Anthony Hopkins' personality carries the story and it is powerful with lessons that make one want to watch it several times.  You will not be disappointed.  It is now one of my most favorite movies of all time.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|This author's credentials weigh heavily in favor of the view that we all possess an immortal soul, separate and independent from our bodies.  Since this view is shared by most of the great religions and was also present in antiquity, we can take comfort in its persistence, interpreting it as a clue dropped by the Creator to alert us to its tantalizing possibilities.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple run is a fun passtime game to play and a exilerating to get to 1 mill or more and it is just really fun.
B00516G5W0|5.0|This is basically a must have for Zoro fans and also it being a rerelease, good chance to get it for cheap!!
B002N5N4M6|5.0|This season really delivers the laughs, i love every second. You get just as much enjoyment the first time watching as you do the tenth time
0783116934|4.0|I would read Rob Smith's &#34;Child 44&#34; before tackling this book.  &#34;Child 44&#34; is based on this true story of one of the worst serial killers in Russia.  After the novel, you will be curious of the actual story, but won't be disappointed at the novel's treatment of it.
B00280LYIM|5.0|I loved the book I think it was a great book as I think all books by Rick Riordan are.It was an awesome action filled story but I wasn't  to surprised because this was by him and Iove most stories by him but this by far is one of his best ones yet.I would recommend  this book to readers who love action wicked books about mythology.I can't wait to read the next one.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Interesting story with a couple of nice twists.  Would recommend as it was the type of book you did not want to put down.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Sometimes the sex was a little too much, but love the way she puts her ideas together and her writing style
B008XG1X18|5.0|Really great to view on my Kindle and share with friends on facebook. Just love to go through the craft section you learn a lot.
B00A6N7BS0|3.0|Besides the twist of having one of the cartel &#34;kingpins&#34; really be a queen, and two friends loving the same girl mixed in, this is another telling of the violence, greed and corruption of the drug &#34;industry&#34; and some of the portrayals come off as rather cookie-cutter. I kept hoping it would get better as it progressed, but ended up not being impressed at all.
B007TK77QE|3.0|Not a very exciting story and not one of those books that I could not put down. Did not like the broad accent evident in much of the text.
B005V4FJC4|4.0|A fun version of some old favorites.  A few of the tempos don't seem to really &#34;fit&#34; but all in all a great Christmas album!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Reading the blurb to this story, it might be easy to expect something contrived and goofy about the storyline. It seems like something straight out of a sitcom -- girl goes to Vegas, gets massively drunk, and wakes up the next morning upchucking her intestines into a toilet, and (oh yeah) married to the guy standing next to her. Seems like a ridiculous premise for a story. But ... this is actually very good. It quickly moves away from the sitcom-like setup into an intriguing study of two people who seem to have sworn off love but find that their hearts aren't so easy to shelter.<br /><br />First of all, in order to enjoy this book you need to suspend belief for just a little bit. I would never, ever think that this situation would be a good one for anyone to hope for. Chances are, if you get wasted in Vegas and get married overnight, you are not going to wake up next to a super hot, super rich, and super kind guy. Your chances would be significantly higher to marry a complete loser in this way. Secondly, Connor's actions just don't seem to jive very well with who he supposedly is. I cannot imagine that an uber-rich man who is used to girls throwing themselves at him for the wrong reasons (fortune-hunting) would be so quick to legally bind himself to a woman he has just met. Sure, he claims to have superior instincts, but his business sense should have made him at least do a small background check at least before rushing off to marry a brand new acquaintance. And then, after all that happens, he is shocked, SHOCKED to discover that Megan was too drunk to remember the night before. How could he have not recognized someone to be THAT drunk? It doesn't make sense. But, like I say, if you can suspend disbelief for awhile, you will find a sweet story that is enjoyable to read.<br /><br />I was looking for something light and breezy (if that makes sense) to read this week, and this book was perfect. Megan and Connor are wonderful lead characters for this contemporary romance. Both are strong and intelligent and independent. I really loved Connor. In fact, as I read the first part of the book I was almost ready to criticize that he was TOO perfect. Every action was wonderfully romantic and caring, and perfect in every way. He knew just what to say and just what to do. Megan seemed to be the person with the demons to destroy before she could give her heart to this relationship and make the marriage work. But then, later in the story, Connor loses that shiny perfect cover, and all of the sudden his personality developed layers. He became absolutely fascinating as the nice, romantic Connor of the first half of the book became the cold, almost heartless Connor of the second half. Mira Lyn Kelly was able to write this change in a very believable way where I could absolutely believe that this could happen. I didn't like his actions, but I did understand them. Having Megan and Connor both have to work through issues of trust and security in relationships really created a rich novel, full of interesting things to think about as I read.<br /><br />The romance was swoon-worthy. There was an ease and lightness to their conversations and actions that made it easy to root for Megan and Connor. It was easy to forget that they had only known each other for a very short amount of time. I appreciated that this book did not rush right into a sexual relationship. It allowed the two of them to really develop a connection that did not involve lusting for the next heated sexual encounter. Instead, I felt the mental bond before the physical. These days, that does not often happen in romances, and I feel as if the pacing of the relationship in this novel was perfect.<br /><br />I LOVED the ending. I loved the way that Connor came to recognize his true feelings. It might have wrapped up a bit too conveniently, but seriously, I didn't mind this at all. I didn't go into this book expecting much, but I came away loving it a lot. It is a sweet and fun contemporary romance that is perfect for a day spent relaxing, curling up with a great book. Four stars!y romance that is perfect for a day spent relaxing, curling up with a great book. Four stars!
B00633PFQC|4.0|This fabulous professor blew my mind with his &#34;Justice&#34; series. He's not as successful with this boob. That's not to say that he doesn't give you plenty to think about... just a bit repetitive on this subject.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|Not very many choices of games to play; it is not very user friendly and I would not really recommend it as a good free download for your tablet.
B000ID37KO|5.0|The movie came super quick!!! The product was brand new, which is what it said online. I was just really impressed with the quickness. It was a gift for my friend for her birthday and I had time to spare!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is a great game I could play it all day . I mean litrily. I could not put it down
B003SA7X9K|5.0|This is just a great show.  I enjoy this recording better than the soundtrack (though they are quite similar) simply because of the fact that JCM sings the Tommy Gnosis songs.
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|Gteat quality. ... something I wasn't expecting.  Will continue to watch movies on Amazon. Thanks for bringing this great movie experience.
0955153077|5.0|This book is everything we could have wanted, what a great reference for  my son the Graphic artist, who is doing digital painting.  He was so pleased.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|I loved this game. Great mix of puzzles and adventure. I did have to use the hint option more than I wanted to, and it took me a minute to find where it was located. I wish the game was a little longer as well. Some reviews stated they had trouble loading the game, but it worked fine on my kindle fire. Good game overall.
B0084U0IEG|3.0|I did enjoy this book pretty well. The story moved along apace, without being really thrilling or suspenseful. There's quite a bit of espionage subtlety, like the difference between MI 5 and MI6, and interesting historical context-- the Cold War, the earliest energy crisis, labor strikes, elections of people whose names I know only from Beatles songs--but  all is probably better appreciated by a native.theres a lot here for discussion groups to debate and discuss: ethical, moral, sexual dilemmas; not to mention the novelty of a male author writing in a female voice.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is great . the puzzles really make your mind work. its even better for the tablet because. you get the almighty jumbo pack.  GET THE GAME RIGHT NOWWW!!!!!!!!!!
B006ATJXQW|5.0|What a great prequel to te maze Runner.  Realy help set up how and why the stories in the maze runner came to be. I wish I could have read this fiirst.

B0084BMUFA|5.0|We have always had at least 1 version of &#34;A Christmas Carol&#34; every year.  It is a time honored story.  If it isn't reading it yourself, we can watch it on dvd, or listen to it on an audio book.  We look forward to it every year.  It is our favorite Christmas story.  I recommend it to everyone.
B007THA4FI|3.0|Good writing, but with sporatic reading the characters are hard to follow.  Think I will begin again and take notes about the characters, hopefully the story line will flow together better.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I love this it takes me back to my army days and is enlightening as to what military life is all about.<br />A must read.
B0074V3712|5.0|With this book and the work that underlies it, E.O. Wilson has done a great service to human understanding. It may be that no one alive has a better grasp of the natural origins of human society, morality, and psychology. He summarizes the latest research in evolutionary biology and related fields to present an entirely convincing vision that his work has been instrumental in creating. Using remarkable examples from other social creatures that, like humans, behave altrusistically--in the loose sense of sacrificing their reproductivity for the group--he helps isolate what is unique about humans and how those traits developed. The central thesis is that natural selection operates both at the individual and group levels, and so our instincts our fundamentally both selfish and altruistic towards our group, however broadly or narrowly defined. His critique of kin selection theory--the idea that we cooperate with group members because they are more likely to share some of our genes--is devastating. Wilson's group selection theory seems destined to serve as the basis for advancements in science, religion, and philosophy for centuries to come.  It is a bit technical in places, where the argumentation is more subtle, but for the broadly educated lay reader, the key points are crystal clear. For those fascinated by existential quandries, here you can find a scientific foundation for the classic ideas advanced by the great secular thinkers like Plato, Cicero, and Hume.
B000T433CO|5.0|A great feel good Holiday movie.  Really a chick flick anytime.  Lots of laughs and senarios we all have been in.  I would recommend this for anyone wanting to watch a feel good movie
B003V1WST6|5.0|I loved the book, read it for a book club otherwise would have never picked up the book, although I loved it, I did find myself upset with the protagonist mainly because she was not strong enough she just ran away..
B0055Q5F36|5.0|I threw away the screen protector and went with Armorsuit Militaryshield Screen Protector Shield for Samsung Galaxy.<br />Unfortunately, the Samsung micro USB cord does not fit very well with the case.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I found myself skipping over paragraphs. The book was too wordy. I was surprised by the number of people who gave it 5 stars.
1608870081|5.0|The book is awesome! I love all of the pictures. The pop up part is great, and the pictures are vibrant and beautiful.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|wish we could play the tournaments ans specialty rooms and slots on the kindle fire. then it wojld be great
B006TKP2B2|5.0|This was a great read!  If you like William Gibson's books, then you will probably rate this book as a \\"five\\" also.  It's a dystopian future story that i would decribe as a \\"biopunk\\" story instead of cyberpunk.  Very well-written with some believeable-sounding science behind it.  This is one I will definitely keep in my library to loan out.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use this for work, school, family and even recipes! the best feature is that I then have access to it all from any web-enabled device.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|The book is a good read, but a bit of a sleeping pill. That's why for me it goes for only stars.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I just couldn't put this book down! Finished within eight hours. I absolutely loved it, and would recommend it to anyone.
B00AA7O6QC|5.0|Better than the first movie. Just a great shoot-em up action movie with all of the great movie tough guys.
B00683JK9K|5.0|I love the quiet music and doing the puzzles when I am somewhere like the doctors waiting room where I don't want to get too involved in reading a book.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|This is a great car-jamming, road-tripping album. I recommend this to anyone who even just likes one of the songs. They are all so very catchy. or something
B0083P1QUM|4.0|I have just finished re-reading all the Scarpetta books leading up to the Bone Bed.  I agree with others that this book hails a return to the Kay Scarpetta that got me to keep reading the series.  I look forward impatiently to the next book.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Loved it a great addition to my collection, I grew up with Marvel comics. I really enjoyed watching it and I am sure will watch it again many times.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|loved it, it is funny & also hard to predict what will happen next. I think this book would be a good for anybody.

0425180638|5.0|I just finished reading this book today. I have been collecting the Scarpetta books for years, but was missing several. I appreciate the quick response to my order.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Wonderful ensemble cast of stellar British actors whose characters have come up with a novel solution to irrelevancy as they age. Fabulous cinematography and location.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|The whole family love this game.  Can be challenging since the further you get the harder it is.<br />We would recommend this to all.

B007SYWFRM|4.0|Grandchildren have fun with this one!  The only downside is that the user must be able to read or have someone<br />read to them.
B00881VLCE|3.0|Kept stopping for no reason even though my friend has exact same device & works fine on hers. Un installed and re installed a bunch of times. No result though
B009GEEMLY|5.0|I enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to my firends and family, mailman, banker, mechanic, carpenter, wife and dog
B007A2O3FO|5.0|Maggie Smith is one of my favorite actresses, along with a host of others. I enjoy British programming and would like to find Are You Being Served series.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I purchased this for myself since I have heard good things about the game, but my grandchildren are always playing.<br />They are showing my how to play better.
B0092MKFIY|4.0|Bought this on a suggestion from a friend . I was pleasantly surprised . The whole album is worth listening to .
B009HELT3C|4.0|It was one of the better Men in Black movies. Humorous<br /><br />I rated it 4 stars only because I beleive the movie rental time should be for 48 hours not 24.<br />Lots of things going on for the age group this is for. Soccer, Studies, Family events.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|I have enjoyed all of Johnny Depp's movies. I haven't found another actor that can change characters so often and still shine with natural talents.
B005723JSQ|5.0|I think it's kind of a shame that Sophie Kinsella is best know for the Shopaholic books, because I really think some of her other books are better. Like The Undomestic Goddess, or Can You Keep A Secret? Or this one.<br /><br />This is not deep literary reading. It's light and fun and funny, and it doesn't pretend to be anything else. And that's why I like it.
B0093LFGMO|5.0|This is an amazing album! Almost EVERY sone could be a single, and standouts include \\"Different\\", \\"Gospel\\", \\"Not Like The Others\\", \\"Hunting For You\\", and \\"Into The Silence\\".<br /><br />\\"Candy\\" is a straightforward pop song that I suppose could have been sung by anyone, but still a lot of fun regardless.<br /><br />Forget the naysayers, forget the critics that claim Robbie is past his prime and no longer has his fingers on the pulse of pop music, forget the whiners who complain that the style of his Guy Chambers collaborations is no longer present - good artists adapt and stay relevant way past their prime, and as long as it's a good song and Robbie is singing, I am happy!<br /><br />Simply put, I feel this album is one that any true Robbie Williams fan will cherish, and even non-Robbie fans can enjoy. As far as I am concerned, this is a return to form for Mr. Williams, and hopefully we will get lots more.  Robbie Forever!
1451695187|5.0|I gave Proof Of Heaven a 5 star rating because  this book , extremely compeling and so well written,  captured my soul and I could not put it down.<br />I have read many near death stories over the years and have continued the search to understand  the meaning of our existence.  Eben's  account  made complete sense to me and has made the difference in restoring my Faith.<br />I am very happy for the reason that I can now believe that the strong sense of closeness and communication I have been feeling with my deceased husband is something very real . I no longer fear death.  Thank you, Dr. Alexander, for sharing.<br />I would recommend this engaging book  to anyone seeking to understand and be content with what may happen after our body dies...<br />I will be giving copies of Proof Of Heaven as Christmas gifts this year.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|Serena Frome the protagonist of the story, is very like me in as much as she loves to read books, this is where the likeness stops.<br />  We get to know Serena from when she is growing up at home, her parents are very normal reasonable people with not too much exciting going on in their lives.  After leaving school for university Serena gets the urge to be herself, and  to start experience life. her love of books influences her choice of men.  She rationalizes her somewhat boring hard to get type of lover, which sounds reasonable when she is telling the story.<br /> Her love of books takes her out of the boring corridors of MI5 as a clerk, to working as a spy.  Her love life and personal life become intertwined and complicated, and this is when the classic Ian Mc Ewan comes into his own. Brilliant<br />  The story is completely believable, and very well written, and as I advanced through the book, and I got to like Serena and sometimes identify and sympathize with her.<br />  I am a great fan of Ian Mc Ewan the author, this book and his previous one The Innocent are different from his earlier books, but  like all his  books I enjoyed it until the last page.
B005HSL626|5.0|the app is so fun! it is very addicting.this might sound weird, but I love the peircing sound of the bananna. when u slice it. Ps how do u change the review name?
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I had trouble putting this book down.  It was different and exciting.  I couldn't figure out what would happen next.  The only thing that made me go &#34;darn&#34; was that it ended abruptly.  Looking back I think that was the best way but at the time....I just couldn't believe that was it.
B0098VYKSA|2.0|I had really high hopes going in to see this movie, but I found myself (from the beginning) laughing out loud when I wasn't supposed to be.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn's Mitch Rapp series continues with current event like matters. You have to read each page deliberately so the  book doesn't end too soon. The one criticism: Mr. Flynn isn't sufficiently prolific.  Read and enjoy the  continuing adventures of Mitch Rapp and his world : the CIA and protecting US interests.
B00632HWOG|4.0|Beats carrying a laptop or netbook around to check your mail.  Screen is naturally larger than my phone, so is much easier to read.
B0076DEJMO|2.0|I found the people dull and the story line is just a rehash of old plot lines.<br />The discription of the people doesn't fit their role.  I found myself<br />reading 4 or 5 pages and then putting it down thinking why am i doing this,<br />am i that dored.
B007IK44CK|3.0|Not that any MI movie has been great.  All action, no story makes a long movie.  Time for Tom Cruise to hang it up.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The caption on poster says it all: Fight the Dead; Fear the Living. I've noticed that the group takes the walkers in stride now. No fear, as long as they are not outnumbered, even leaving one stray walker alone. The focus of the show has shifted from fighting the dead, though that is still a big emphasis. Now, it seems that learning to live among the living in peace has become the order of the day. And it's not going real well. I've said it often... this is not my normal genre of show. But something in the first episode captured me and has held me rapt for every show since then... it's not a show about dead people, it's a show about relationships among the living in a world gone mad. If everyone is infected, the situation will probably never change for these folks.That provokes a sort of desperation in their living and clinging to each other. I could go on and on about this show. I don't watch any other show with this type of theme. Nothing compares.
B009POCG0Y|4.0|The plot is simple in this film.  It is the execution which makes it.  A family that is the living embodiment of the term trailer trash, complete with the trailer, decides to knock off another family member to collect the insurance. They need to hire a hitman, who is also a Texas lawman, to do the deed and that brings Killer Joe into this family. Every cross and double cross imaginable emerges from this hiring and the film is a combo of hilarity and mayhem.<br /><br />This film is a major comeback for director William Friedkin, who is now 76 years old. His movies have never been for the faint of heart.  They are all violent. So I don't view one of his movies expecting it to be placid in any way. Matthew McC is the lead as killer Joe and he does a wonderful job.  I haven't liked his roles in his rom com career and if this is the end of his rom comming, I am all for it.  He seemed to move in this direction with \\"Lincoln Lawyer\\" and then built on that performance with this role. The only other actor I can picture giving this performance is Woody Harrelson as this performance reminds me of his role in NATURAL BORN KILLERS.<br /><br />We are in for many other treats with this film besides McC and Friedkin though. Emile Hirsch plays the dumbest drug dealer who has ever trod the dust in the trailer park. Everything he undertakes is a disaster. Thomas Haden Church plays his father and you can see the acorn did not fall from the tree.  These are the two who hire the hitman. The father's slatternly wife is played brilliantly by Gina Gershorn, who is unrecognizable in her trailer trash get up. Her extended scene with Matthew McC is the best in the film. Caleb Deschanel is also on board for his as usual brilliant cinematography.<br /><br />My favorite Friedkin film is CRUISING with Al Pacino, which virtually everyone hates, including Pacino.  So if you have doubts about this film, read some reviews by amazon reviewers who don't like virtually all of Friedkin's work, as I do.<br /><br />I am giving this four stars instead of 5.  It is very, very good.  Maybe even 4.5 stars.  However, it is not the EXORCIST, FRENCH CONNECTION, or CRUISING, all Friedkin films. It is also not TRUE ROMANCE, the five star film it most closely resembles.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B008BSPQ3E|1.0|I bought this as I am a vinyl nut and everything was OK except THE VINYL ALBUM WAS MISSING from the box set. Seriously. The box set was completely wrapped in plastic, unopened and virgin. Everything else was there, just not the vinyl. I contacted PeterGabriel.com but they told me to contact Amazon! Excuse me, but the entire boxset was unopened, wrapped and untouched, so the problem was in the manufacturing, not the re-sale. But PeterGabriel.com don't seem to care.<br /><br />Pissed off.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|I really like this game. I downloaded it as the FAOTD and was quite pleased. It's definitely worth an actual purchase!<br /><br />The graphics are great, the gameplay / puzzles are quite fun, and not too hard. It is a bit confusing at times, but at least there is the hint guide to get you through if you get really stuck.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend this game if you are looking for something fun to pass those &#34;few moments&#34; here and there.
B004EBUXI0|5.0|One of the best CPU I've seen, i bought it for a friend and his machine runs in the air. Nice CPU
B00A1U2SVS|5.0|Very satisfied with the quality and the selections. The band had a great sound that was mastered very nicely and includes some great solos.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Crime suspense plus dysfunctional personality equals perfect match. The characters do a great job interacting with each other. The Bobby Goren we always wanted.

0385344333|5.0|I am a big fan of the Jack Reacher series. I can honestly say I have really liked all the books. With all the rumors flying about ending the series, I can only say I hope \\"Jack\\" ends with dignity and not as he has lived; alone and violently, because he has always fought for justice.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|Delivers service as twitter does - with minor outages... but generally a good product<br /><br />Twitter is the best in short length communication with complete strangers and friends...

B004LWZWGK|1.0|Ultraviolet is the worst digital service available. How did this service get connected with major movie companies? I will be returning my copy and buying it on itunes so I can have a digital copy that works. I have tried for over an hour to get ultraviolet's website to work and JUST LIKE THE LAST TIME it is down, same thing happened when I bought another ultraviolet copy. GO BUY ON ITUNES!!
1608871452|5.0|This is an excellent book for any Supernatural fan. I ordered this expecting a basic coffee table book with a few obligatory blurbs praising everyone involved with the show and some pretty pictures. You get that the blurbs and yes, the pretty pictures, too, but you get much more than that as well! Included throughout the book are little 'extras' that were a pleasant surprise--a mini car air freshener, two sheets of sticker decals featuring symbols and logos featured on the show (like for Plucky Pennywhistle's!), several mini-posters of the Carver Edlund book covers as seen in Season 5, a map with places the boys have been--and more. The book itself is large, too, so you're not peering at the pictures trying to make anything out. Overall I was very pleasantly surprised with the book and look forward to paging through and discovering each and every hidden goodie inside.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I'm about 65% through reading thjs final chapter in the Song of Fire and Ice Series.<br />Everything seems to by coming together with the main characters.<br />The rest of this book has got me staying up late to finish...but what anticipatiion.<br />Tom
B008Z9L94O|4.0|It's good to get this on vinyl stateside. It's beautifully packaged. The booklet appears to be a nice addition. I've listened to it once already.  That's unfortunately why this 5 star album only got 4 stars.  I am very lucky to possess the original hut release of this on vinyl as well.  I bought this because i wanted one a copy i could just spin after ive had a beer or two and not fret too much.  Zero is a perfect example. It is way too hot. Most of the song is on the verge of clip. This is not the case on the hut release.  I actually pulled it out and compared. I didn't notice any other blaring defects.  I enjoyed the soundstage of most songs and overall sounded quite good.  It often reminded me of how talented and overlooked jimmy is.  In conclusion, I was worried that this release might negatively affect the value of my original lp, but I am not pretty convinced it has done just the opposite.
B00ADYYY50|4.0|I originally gave this album 5 stars but after three weeks of listening ive gotta knock off a star...favorite tracks are paperbond and the plan...I really wanted to give it a 3 but dude dropped two mixtapes for free this year so that's gotta count for something...
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie despite the reviews at the time it came out.<br /><br />Ignore any online reviews by the so called media reviewers because this<br />movie is well worth it.<br /><br />I enjoyed it so much I bought some books here at amazon regarding this slice of history<br />of alcohol prohibition in America.<br /><br />The acting was superb.<br /><br />It shows the rampant corruption among politicians and the police forces and shows the story of one family (3 brothers)<br />who refused to pay the currupt politicians who had the police do their dirty work.<br /><br />Rent it ..it's a 4 star movie.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I haven't finished all of the books but at this point I am totally engrossed and loving them.  I love the chapters being from 1 of the character's perspectives.  The stories have made me cry and laugh out loud.  The bad part of these books is that I hate to put them down.
B004ZRV3AU|3.0|I've followed the instructions to the tee, but still haven't gotten a clean cut.  All my cuts have one little divot in them.  I'll keep trying, but I don't recommend trying it on a special piece of glass right out of the box.  Make sure you perfect the process first (something I haven't been able to do).
B004GYY714|5.0|Great ap. Listen to stations all over the world on my phone and others close to home. Wish I had it on my car radio
B009O07NMA|5.0|Prolly one of the best cds ive heard in awhile. True country at its best, not a bad song on this cd.

B005LAJ212|4.0|this was a gift for my daughter who miss the first season of revenge now she has her girl friend hooked
B00957T6X6|4.0|Excellant story and characters. The only reason I only gave it 4 stars is the rank sexuality. The story really didnt need it
034580404X|5.0|best book set i have purchased.  its a must read book set, the story has lots of turns and has you on the EDGE of your seat
B00571F26Y|3.0|I liked much of what the book had to say but was a bit unsure of some of the research. I definitely learned quite a bit and did change my eating habits. I feel better after cutting most of the wheat out of my diet.
B005FITIDC|5.0|great movie i would watch it over and over again,And reccommend it to anyone the story make me happy to live in america
B009O2XY12|3.0|Bubble Mania has some great graphics, some nice twists (an animal throws the bubbles up as opposed to shooting them, and your goal is to rescue bunnies trapped in the bubbles), cool power-ups, and in the higher levels challenging puzzles. That's the good news!<br />Now, the cons:  TeamLava, the maker of this game, has taken the pay to play approach. Thus, can 'buy' gems  or energy to buy powerups or more games. I think one of the most annoying things is that each game you play costs one 'energy'. You start out with a fixed amount (5). Complete a level and you earn another energy. Lose, and you LOSE an energy.  Energy regenerates on a timed basis, but if you have a run of bad luck, you'll have to either stop playing the game for a few hours or spend some coin to buy extra energy so you can continue playing.<br />While I understand that gaining revenue from these apps is something most developers want to do, I'd rather see the initial cost go up a little then be faced with the constant requests to purchase things within the game itself.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|UNIQUE, relaxing, fun, beautiful. I loved this game! My only disappointment is that I finished in just a few short hours. I would be willing to spend $$$ if the developer produces a similar game with longer gametime.
B000FC11A6|5.0|An awesome books, specially for nerds. Quite a tome too. I should have read it on vacation as I found it very detrimental to my productivity!
B008458O3S|5.0|Easy enough for my 7 year old son to get, but tricky enough to take me lots of time to finish all f the levels. It really is amazing that this game was made by a single programmer. Highly recommended for puzzle fans.
B005LVR6ZA|5.0|This book is very unique, I thought it was fantastic, it is a story of science fiction/fantasy.I could not put this book down, I read it straight though in one read . It was frend keeps you on the edge of your seat.I found it to be really top notch writing, I would be intrested in other books by this author.Really excellent story, I highly recomend this book!!.
B003SNKBXW|5.0|This is one of this author's very good novels, with fascinating characters and a gripping plot. He mixes in some fascinating literary history which lends an interesting flavor to this story.
B005XLN97M|5.0|My 4 year old daughter is really into Barbies this year.  I hate that the barbie houses are so much money and was very pleased to find a cute one at a good price.  I live in a small townhouse and this will be easy to store.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|People all around the world have problems and this love story is an eye opener to what goes on in other worlds.
B000OCXI3K|3.0|I picked this book because I had seen the movie, It is quite different from the movie the theme is a little darker than the movie. Yet, the story it self was very good it has an up beat ending.It is well written and keeps you involved in the story. You really look forward to what happens next. I recomend this book, but do not compare it to the movie, enjoy it for the story it is.
B001NLKT60|5.0|This picks up the incredible story of Lisbeth Salander and gets one involved with spies, the Swedish justice system, and the almost failed efforts by her friends to save her. There are amazing plot twists and the reader is constantly gripped by them.
B005VPRDAY|5.0|My daughter was using the huge colorful building blocks, but now since she is 4 years old the smaller ones are right up her alley.  I got this for a Christmas gift for her and am excited to give it to her for Christmas this year.  Very small box which will be easy to store, I am happy about that.
B0017SWSCW|5.0|This was the first time I've read an Archer book..Wow it was wonderful..He nailed the old British system perfectly as only a Brit can..I then read &#34;As the Crow Flies&#34; and was equally impressed..He is definately on a par with Jack Higgins (Patterson)or any of the gr eat contemporary writers..Even Archer's background is exciting..Three cheers and definately five stars.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Hopefully, this is the straight story, unlike the Obama version where he personally killed Osama bin Ladin with his bare hands... just kidding.  The book is informative and does a great job setting the stage for the actual take-down.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|If possible, this is the best of the series. Fast moving plot and characters who come to fruition. The ending is strangely satisfactory. I'm sure most readers will agree that Larsson's death before publication of this series deprived him of knowing how joyfully they would be received by a discerning public!
0547884591|5.0|Wow, what can I say? The body of work of Four Hour Chef is definitely what I have come to expect from Tim Ferriss: clean, concise, and elegant! But the BOOK itself...I was SO impressed by the quality of the paper and awesome colors of the pages, I honestly don't know how Amazon did this as the price in which the book sells! Bravo, Amazon, Bravo!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I am a big fan of &#34;The Walking Dead&#34; series.  This season is no different.  Each episode I sit waiting to see if long standing characters are abruptly wiped from the script.  Great show!
B0067RQYNW|4.0|I rarely edit documents on my tablet (even more rarely on my phone) but occasionally its handy to be able to.  This software is a little laggy so if I used it often I would probably be frustrated with it, but if like me, you have a hard time paying $10 for something you use a couple of times a year, this is just the ticket.  It gets the job done, and its free!
B001HBYHFA|5.0|An absolute must for any Firefly fan! Or if you don't know of Firefly yet, you will after this movie!!!
0062213423|1.0|This book was listed as for ages 8 and up, so as you can imagine, I was very surprised when I saw more than one picture of these boys with their PANTS OFF showing off their boxers.  One of the images came with text that says, \\"Stripping off is very liberating.\\"  I don't know much about this boyband as I was buying this book as a gift for a 2nd grader, but I know this book is not appropriate for 8 year olds.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|Seemed to run ok but have to give it a bit more time to learn about it.  Love the jest of the game.
B000MR1V22|5.0|Just an all around fun movie, And the grandfathers wisdom is GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!! A little fun for the whole family. A must rent movie!
B001JV5BIA|5.0|of the three movies made of this movie ,this one is the best.Don't waste your money on the other two.,
0345803485|5.0|This was a fun and light novel! I've been glued to it from the beginning to the end :) Recommended
0547884591|5.0|I have purchased all three of Tim's books and to me this one his the best. This book is a great reference source and is also an enjoyable read.
B0071BGOJC|4.0|Ken Follett is consistently writing highly interesting and entertaining books. Winter of the World is no exception. To try even to write about the period of the 2nd World War and not get lost in details and still give the bigger picture is a great feat. Follet has managed to give a (albeit limited by the plot) picture of those difficult years.<br />I only had to go back even so often to read about the backgroud of the different characters of the plot in the first book of his trilogy. Highly recomendable book.
B002DKGWSE|1.0|There are three movie versions of this movie and this is the worst one of the three.Don't waste your money on this version.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Excellent wrap up to the first half of the season and of course a good cliffhanger leading into the 2nd half. Best show on TV right now.
B007HACDLK|5.0|This is my first Vince Flynn book but it won't be my last.  I now intend to read all of his books.  He obviously does a great job of researching his material.  Vince makes me feel like I'm right there watching the action unfold.  I read a lot but this book,  I couldn't put down until it was finished<br />  A great read!
B0051GY0LS|3.0|I like the idea of having a youngster as the hero of the story. I assume that the T. Boone books are meant for teenagers. I wonder if they can identify themselves with Theodore.<br />Yes, I will buy the next one as well as I have bought everything J. Grisham wrote up to now. Not that everything was that great but by now it became a habit!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|lots of fun. good story. had a hard time putting it down. looking forward to more big fish games. good price.
B009JBZH54|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2WWKX3WGMQJ6L]]  The boxset has finally been released; all three installments of Nolan's realistic and cinematic take on Batman dispersed on five discs. While people tend to focus on the acute realism, it is not so grounded that it defies the source in which it came from. The three films circle around different Batman comic arcs in unique ways. This boxset includes:<br /><br />Batman Begins (2005)<br />The Dark Knight (2008)<br />The Dark Knight Rises (2012)<br /><br />A 64 page book detailing behind the scenes with the inside look many of us have been yearning for, which makes for an entertaining read. Those hours of extra content on the discs are just not always as accessible as a quick read available right away at your fingertip. All three films come in great, the picture truly is wonderful as it actually is filmed on, well film. 70 mm cameras come in handy when heightened realism is at foot, which illustrates a distinct contrast to the digital jitter of today's 'films'. The explosive scenes and death defying stunts go beyond the mystery of cape and cowl, the bonus content reveals the meticulous care for quality and picture quality.<br /><br />Batman Begins is self-explanatory, Bruce Wayne finds himself with guilt, anger, and more importantly fear. He must confront his inner demons to establish truthful vengeance. Begins was foreshadowed by its 2008 sequel The Dark Knight, which displayed Heath Ledger's acting prowess as the chaotic Joker.<br /><br />Batman's dilemmas were always skin deep, literally as Bruce Wayne juggles his persona's before the Jokers attempt to disrupt society. The Dark Knight gravitated audiences eyes on the villain whose intensity was so hot make up would smear and further taint that gruesome near necrotic scar cheek to cheek.  It was as though Bruce's conflict were buried in favor of the Joker's antagonizing run through Gotham City. It is not to be overlooked though, the Joker tempts Batman's vary nature. The Dark Knight is often considered top dog of the three, pitting Begins and Rises for the second position.<br /><br />In all honesty I thought The Dark Knight Rises was just as engaging, just not in equal amounts. Rises, frame for frame is every bit as good as The Dark Knight. Ounce for ounce it becomes a bit more on the rare side when it comes to Batman, who has disappeared after the events of The Dark Knight. Likened to that of a hermit Bruce once again must learn what it means to be Batman, and not just a man in a mask.<br /><br />I wrote up an in-depth review for The Dark Knight Rises the other evening, which can be found under the normal release of the film, if anyone is interested. The `Ultraviolet' digital stream is available until December 2014, the other slip insert I still have yet to read. The box itself is quite nice for the price. Best obtain now, three great films with a book and a digital `copy' for a little over the price of the average movie release is quite the deal.<br /><br />I had to shrink the video, literally compressing it to a file size that would upload. I apologize about the video size, and the noise. Lastly, this trilogy is a great buy, the price is just a bonus.en considered top dog of the three, pitting Begins and Rises for the second position.<br /><br />In all honesty I thought The Dark Knight Rises was just as engaging, just not in equal amounts.

B0014XCMVM|4.0|This album does not pack quite the same punch as \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" or \\"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie\\", the only other 2 albums from Alanis that I am totally familiar with. But it is still quality music from this talented artist. Her lyrics, always interesting, range from the deeply personal (\\"Torch\\", \\"Straitjacket\\") to the very abstract, even cryptic (\\"Citizen Of The Planet\\"). Most of the songs have a simpler, more mainstream structure than those of the 2 prior albums I mentioned. And perhaps because of this, her voice gets the opportunity to sound more mature and controlled than before. It sounds prettier. As far as musical arrangements are concerned, there are several strong tracks: \\"Citizen Of The Planet\\", \\"Straitjacket\\", \\"Versions Of Violence\\" and \\"Moratorium\\". And there are milder ballads: \\"Not As We\\", \\"In Praise Of The Vulnerable Man\\", \\"Torch\\" and \\"Tapes\\". \\"Giggling Again For No Reason\\" is a very lighthearted dance track, not what we usually hear from Alanis. It is a very pleasant diversion. There is some techno production, but it is neither overwhelming nor all-pervasive. All in all, if you like Alanis and her music in general, you will probably be satisfied with this album.
B008HTQ28K|5.0|Over the last years I got the feeling that J. Grisham lost a bit his original style of writing. I found some of his latest books not realy &#34;gripping&#34;. The Racketeer is one of the best books he ver wrote. Almost until the last pages one doesn't really know how everything will come together. And the way Grisham resolves the plot is excellent, credible and very clever. A &#34;must&#34; read.
B0046ECFRM|5.0|This was a really good book.  I really felt Anna's character and loved her witty thoughts.  This is a well written book and would recommend to others.
B002SSUQFG|1.0|Needed a replacement watch and had seikos before.  But this is the last seiko I will get!  It would be 6 minutes fast by week's end and you can hear pieces rattle inside.  Also, the pins would let go and the band would come apart.  What a crappy watch.  Will go back to citizen which lasted over 10 years. and kept decent time.
0060920084|3.0|Unlike some of his other books, this one is a little too long and repetitive.  It is kind of  a Mad Magazine version of a road trip.  It certainly was funny, but was not Bryson's best work.  For those that want a truly funny book that is not tedious, I would recommend The Life and Times Of the Thunderbolt Kid.  That book would be a better introduction to Bryson's humor and writing skill.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|This was a great romp into fantasy. And if you're gonna get the Avengers, you need to collect all the back story movies too.
0802473156|5.0|Marriage counselor recommended this book and I found it very helpful in understanding how we tend to show our affection and love in the way that we like to receive it but don't always pay close attention to how your partner needs to receive it.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|Good movie only complain is Amazon lowered the price after my item was received. Kind of a bummer, but item was purchased at the comparable cost it would have been a best buy with tax.
0547884591|5.0|As a Tim Ferriss fan I was excited for this book to come out. I ordered it a year in advance! The content is awesome. My favorite sections are the meta section (how to learn things) and the recipes. The wild section is a little beyond my scope of experimentation but there is something for everyone!<br /><br />Tim writes the book in his usual conversational tone making the book an easy read. If you like any of his other writing you'll love this book. If you are new to Tim's writing check out his blog (google it). You can get a good sense of his writing style there.<br /><br />Cheers
B005IZLPMY|5.0|I was unfamiliar with the Captain America comics, so this movie was awesome. My husband, who was familiar with them, though the movie was great too. Its his xmas present.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|great game by the way 1star raters who want better graphics try dragon story, in my opinion both are awesome
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|I have this game on my Nexus and iPhone. I love it! Only problem with the amazon version is the new update is not available yet. There are some great new jet packs on the iPhone version that I can't get on this one :-(  Get the update and get five stars from me.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Well written, excellent acting, and an amusing premise. It's certainly no depiction of real life, but as entertainment it is as engaging as it gets. The charactor of Holmes is an interesting take on the stories by the author Conan Doyle and  a delight to watch in action. Watson is well acted, as only Miss Liu is capable of doing, with an acid touch to the relationship between these two which lends spice to an old format. Set in the present in New York city the stories, thus far, have been original in their settings and themes. Aitogether a very watchable show that should catch and hold the public's attention for many seasons to come.

B0083GQKQG|5.0|Did not really know what to expect when I rented this movie, but am so glad I did. Definitly recommend.
0143038419|5.0|I lovve this book and it is not so used. It is kind of like a new book. I love it.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Used it to sharpen a jagged blade after having to cut open a hand-plaster during one of my on-call nights. Checked the kind-of-battered blade for sharpness before I resharpened it and afterwards. The difference was immense. Now it's sitting in my locker right next to my Victorinox multi-knife.
B004SOR4H6|2.0|I am having trouble getting interested in it.  Doesn't seem to be too exciting - but will not give up on this one.  I'll kleep trying to find &#34;followers.&#34;  Would recommend it to someone with more patience than I have.

B00ADYYY50|4.0|Wiz Khalifa has made a name for himself rapping about weed, money, fashion, and partying. This is what he is known for and this is what you get on this album. You have to judge the album based on these factors and ask yourself did he manage to make a good album sticking to that script? The answer is yes. Wiz states clearly on the track \\"Time\\", \\"I'm just sticking to the script. No new lines\\". Average rappers can make good albums. This is a good album with exceptional production, decent verses, and infectious hooks. You have to judge Wiz for what he does, and assess how well he does that. If you came into this album listening for wide subject matter and introspective lyrics, you were listening to the wrong album from the beginning. Wiz created an album to please his truest fans. You want lyrical rap? Go listen to Kendrick Lamar. Thats what I do. Wiz might not gain many new followers with this release, but those who know what to expect will love it.
B008IGP8QE|5.0|My daughter loves Austin & Ally and the songs that they sing so naturally she loves this CD.  I highly recommend for any kid who loves the show!!
B005SZAEYO|4.0|Twisted Premise?  Check<br />Dark?  Oh yeah.<br />Weird relationships?  Check<br />Bizarre overall feeling?  Check<br />Scary?  Somewhat<br />Have to go back a few minutes every once in a while to see what the heck is happening?  At least once per episode.<br /><br />Dr., doctor's wife, teen daughter & a slew of characters that are worth watching especially Jessica Lange, are you kidding me, she was amazing as the creepy, spying, totally 'off', in-your-bizniz nosy neighbor.
B00A6PD9I4|2.0|There was very little about this movie to like beyond its exemplary look.  Brave didn't hit the necessary buttons that makes one say...Yeah, I know it's a kid movie but I like it, too.
B0031YJFCQ|3.0|Unfortunately the last in the series fell short for me. Like many trilogies, there is only so much substance to go around. The first is golden, the second is decent and it just starts to get old. At parts I think less that Larsson is a literary genius and it feels more &#34;movie of the week.&#34;
B0063B2BNE|5.0|My husband and I love Bones, but after we switched cable providers our recordings got messed up and we had to play catch up.  Purchasing episodes through Amazon was easy and convenient!

B000HIVIOW|4.0|I remember watching this as a child and it completely gripped me back then. It was enchanting, I recall. Anyway it was played on TV last year and my 5 year old loved it. Definitely a classic and highly recommend viewing this.
1407130366|5.0|Better then expected - There was no picture when we ordered it so I was not sure we would get what we wanted but it was perfect. Thank you.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|I love this show and the BluRay edition is terrific.  I really enjoyed it and now my friends are borrowing it.

B009E3EY38|5.0|Old enough to have bought Physical Graffiti when it came out, so I've heard all these songs a thousand times or so.  Concert was fantastic - sound is awesome.  On &#34;Black Dog&#34;, the band seemed a little out of sync, but then everything snapped into place.  Jason Bonham does a credible job covering for his late father, John Paul Jones is the steady presence as always, Robert Plant is in fine voice, and Jimmy Page is the master musician he has long been.
1451620829|5.0|Maybe I should preface my review by saying that I am a huge Kiss fan, but not a Peter fan. I do not own nor have ever owned his 1978 Solo LP, though I do own and listen to Gene's, Paul's, and Ace's. I have never thought Peter's drumming was very good. And his songs that do make it on Kiss records are usually mediocre to me.<br /><br />But this book hooked me from the very beginning and is propelling me though. The writing is honest, and when he says things that happen, that either make him look like an amazing person, or an amazingly stupid dolt...I believe it. Or I believe he believes it. I mean, we all have our individual point of view, how we see things.<br /><br />The editing is amazing, the content, the structure...hats of to Ratso. It is giving me a new respect for someone I thought was a dispensable part of the band. It doesn't matter if he was a great drummer or singer, if you love or hate him...this book is really really good, fun read.

The 3 to 6 are impossible to do, because when you restart the cd, it starts from the beginning. What can I do? My test is in 2 days and I did not even found somewhere to complain in ETS site. =/
1579128955|5.0|This is a 5 star book.  I purchased it for my little 7 year old (going on 40) science bookworm!  He loves elements and the periodic table.  This book has at least 2 pages dedicated to each element with real life examples and all the information you would want to know.  Really, it is a treasure.  You won't be disappointed.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Love it<br />Very realistic and entertaining<br />I definitely recommend this book to anyone who loves a great story about teens

B009GEBBNQ|1.0|What a disappointment!!  I just never ever became engaged in this movie.  They did a great job of publicity for the movie, cuz the actual film was very poor.  I should have given it zero stars.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Great workouts - not easy but not impossible!  I am a mother who hadn't lost that babyweight (after 6 years!) and now I'm losing it and fast.  For those of you who do not have time to work out - you can do this 20 minute workout.  You can do anything for 20 minutes.  Worth every penny.
B009R5GR1K|5.0|I downloaded this app to my Kindle Fire and just love it.  It is a great dictionary, but so much more.  Check out the weather forecast, your horoscope, learn a new word every day, play games--why it's better than a newspaper by telling you what happened on &#34;this day in history&#34; and giving you the days top news story.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I did not start watching Homeland until the last few episodes last season. What impressed me about the show was Claire Danes portrayal of Carrie's unraveling. Now I am watching the series from the beginning and really enjoying it. In my opinion, this is by far the best drama on television!
B008FIHUDO|5.0|It often seems that soul,in the context of a genre of music,refers mainly to a type of singing and playing. Actually you can have the right singing,the right playing and somehow it just isn't quite soul. It's very much a literal term. Very much an individual conception. Bettye LaVette here has a new book out,and one knows she has a lot of stories to tell. But I know two things for sure: her recording career was stalled for decades,and he has a reputation for being a headstrong personality with an enormous sense of conviction in the tradition of all the greats in the genre. This album,celebrating her half century in the \\"biz\\" is musically dedicated to all the music that inspired her along the way.<br /><br />  For starters,this album is extraordinarily funkified. In a very deep southern way too-filled with heavily revered drums,electric guitar,bass and keyboards. Dylan's \\"Everything Is Broken\\",\\"I'm Not The One\\",\\"The More I Search )The More I Die\\",\\"Fair Enough\\" and \\"Time Will Do The Talking\\" all  showcase this predominantly. Her take on \\"Dirty Old Town\\" seems to almost illustrate her own attitude and is presented here in two versions,the later longer and far more spare. The rhythm goes up on the very heavily funky \\"I'm Tired\\",and actually goes very much the opposite direction on the night time bluesy soul of \\"Crazy\\" and \\"Yesterday Is Here\\". Neil Young's \\"Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere\\" gets a countrified treatment whereas Sly's title song goes more to the gospel roots of the song.<br /><br />  One appealing thing about LaVette right off the bat is that,as an interpretive singer,she never veers from altering the song lyrics in certain ways to personalize it,have it make more sense that she's singing them. On the other hand all the songs selected for thing album already make sense in terms of her doing them. And considering that this is the first full length Bettye LaVette album I've ever heard,the fact that comes out so strongly even for a relative newcomer such as myself speaks volumes for her ability to grab the attention of the largely uninitiated.  Also it helps if one is a music lover getting into more interpretive singers at a given time anyway as I am at this point. Even still the overall effect I get from this is that I'd never have known they weren't originals given her take on them.self speaks volumes for her ability to grab the attention of the largely uninitiated.

B00006IX0R|4.0|This is an awesome cd..its not the original, though because one of my friends has a cd like this one and the songs have the longer and better introductions...
B00A3XQVKW|5.0|I love this book! I have just finished reading it for the fourth time. I first read it 20 years ago after my beloved grandfather passed away. It brought me great comfort. I have read it over the years when I'm going through something and each time I read it I receive a different message. I will always have a copy!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great book series.  Read this so I would know what my daughters were talking about and ended up really liking them.
B009CG2YDE|4.0|Ran well on Kindle Fire, brite graphics simple gameplay, fun for a while, got repetitive after a few play throughs.
B005LAII0I|5.0|Oh my gosh!! This movie is just so good, its a must buy! It kinda has a twist to your average Mirror Mirror on the Wall movie :)
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|I would have liked this better if it was just blu ray, DVD, and digital copy.  Then a reduced price with no 3D.  But the price was way better than at retail still.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|Interesting view of what makes one successful. Hard work is certainly a vital component but there are other factors that bring success to one person and not the next. Opportunity, intelligence, being born at the right time all conspire to create the window for success.
B000004286|5.0|My husband and his brother both love this soundtrack, and I like it too.  We've been playing it for months and it still plays perfectly.
B007HACDLK|4.0|I love this series but there are 2 that don't live up to all the others.  Rapp at times was simply a grouchy old man.  Flynn is aging him to fast in my opinion.  Would like the 35-40 year old spook back for a bit.  Flynn could do what Childs did when he put Reacher back in the military.  Loved that too.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Exciting from the start and holds you to the end. Mitch Rapp is the ultimate CIA operative and how every man pictures himself in his mind.
B005GG0MIS|4.0|Enjoyed this book as did my husband as it is a behind the smiles and public images of presidents after they are out of office. These presidents are all from my lifetime so could relate to them easily.
1935251740|5.0|The artificial divorce between science and religion has hurt the human race over the past century, and impaired our ability to make reasonable progress in either area.  Biocentrism, at last, is a theory of reality which embraces both and denigrates neither.  I could not put the book down; Robert Lanza has such a brilliant mind, and is such a gifted writer that I read and then reread most of the chapters just to absorb as much of his insight as I could.  Biocentrism is truly an understanding of reality for the 21st century and beyond.
B00914JWSW|5.0|Always the very best.  Just good easy listening and as always Streisand is the very best. Need more &#34;new&#34; releases.
B004LWZW88|5.0|So after watching Puss N Boots I was shocked at how great and funny it was. It seemed like it would be a funny movie when I saw he trailer but I didnt realize just how great it was. I really will not say too much here about the plot all I will say is that Humpty Dumpty is a rotten egg lol Go check it out and adults you will enjoy this one as well as the kids.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|I would recommend this movie to anyone over the age of 2 and the top end would be ageless. At going on 70 I would say that I hate all the trash movies that keep coming out with all the killings guns and violence that entraps the young people as well as those older who partake in such movie themes.<br />This movie has only one stroke of violence and this does the movie itself no justice for its value.
B008B7OQHM|1.0|My wife purchased this item for me while I was away on military duty.  She ordered the special edition which should have included two discs: the \\"best of\\" cd and the \\"live\\" cd.  I received the edited \\"best of\\" cd and no live disc.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Love the show and Love Amazon.com! Resolution was good. Just like having a DVD movie. Streamed really well with no issues.
B0049VGSLG|5.0|Fantastic fresh, new sound with old school roots!<br />If you love true, old scool, rock n' roll, this cd is fantastic!<br />These songs will stay with you throughout the day.
B007R21JJK|4.0|I've had it for awhile now. I like the on-board video.<br /><br />The board has no decernible flaw that I have found. I like the Windows type Bios control a lot
B004AM5QT4|3.0|Good book, interesting subject matter. However, book was a little slow in spots. Also felt the mom character of Dr. Gen ie was unnecessary as she was written. Either should have developed her more or just mention she was in a home at most.<br />Book worth the read.
B004G606K8|5.0|Loved the Chronicles when they first came out, and they have stood the test of time.  A great series, I'm going to download the Legends trilogy next.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|no problems, plays just fine. I HAVE NO MORE WORDS. I SAID I LIKE IT, YOU NEED TO CHANGE THIS. YOU CAN'T FORCE PEOPLE TO WRITE MORE THAN WHAT THEY WANT TO SAY.  IF YOU DON'T I WILL NOT WRITE ANYMORE REVIEWS UNLESS I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING NEGATIVE!!!!!!
B007HACDLK|5.0|I've read all of Vince Flynn's books, every single one is my absolute favorite until the next one comes out.  This one is no exception.  I loved it so much I hated to finish it.
B0091REZMW|4.0|totally agree with previous review ...run out of diamonds and I refuse to purchase them. I'd like to keep going but you can't.
B00881PPTO|5.0|On our honeymoon, many years ago, we took a car trip to places I wanted to share with my wife from my childhood. Not sure how long we would spend in each place- nor what was available- we would arrive in an area and look for places to stay that seemed nice enough to consider.  My &#34;plan&#34; was to drive down &#34;hotel row&#34; and pick out several places and write down their names.  Then we would look for a public telephone [the good old days] and call to ask the question, &#34;What is special at your hotel/motel and why would I choose you?&#34;  Being a bit shy and a bit strapped for cash, this gave me anonymity and some insight before confronting a desk clerk. It was a perfect system for me and we found some special places.<br />With a cell phone and &#34;hot spot&#34; for my Kindle- this ap is a great modern update to my system and a real boon to our travels. I would recommend it to both honeymooners and road warriors- a great way to make a quick financial discovery or begin the sorting process before a personal call to find out that still important question, &#34;What is special about your hotel/motel and why would I choose you?'
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Yes, I said perfect. I was surprised the Fire did not come with one so I went looking.  After trying a couple I kept this one and have been using it since.  Perfect addition to my app 'family'
B002MFWLXK|5.0|I love Kevin Costner & exploring JFK death is a very interesting movie and makes you think of how much do we really know about this ??? I always loved this movie
B005LAIHPE|5.0|I saw this at the theater and I am glad I purchased it for my library. Very well thought out.
B005HSL626|5.0|My 7 year old daughter, told me about this game and once I started playing, it was a wrap. Everyday I try to out score myself, and did I say it's fun? Well if I didn't its fun!!!!!
B004LWZWGK|1.0|I bought this before I realized that it was an UltraViolet Digital Copy. They are the worst! It's a miserable experience watching the UV Digital Copies - you can't download them onto an iPad, and watching it on the iPad is miserable. It doesn't stream well - constant skips and hesitations, and the screen quality suddenly downgrades itself for no reason. I bought Amazing Spider Man because of the digitial copy and regretted it. Just got the Bluray in the mail, and I'm sending it back to Amazon. Ultraviolet is miserable. I'm going to buy it right from iTunes. Fewer special features, but the extra commentaries (that I'll never listen to) aren't worth a miserable viewing experience.<br /><br />This doesn't even mention that the Bluray disc that I received doesn't work in my player. Fail.
