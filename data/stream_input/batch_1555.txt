B005MYWZKM|5.0|The whole album feels almost surreal. You're given a palette which Florence & co. have covered with colors of all sorts. The vocals are hauntingly beautiful, while the lyrics are poetically deep. The stories behind each track are both heartbreaking, sensual, and tenebrous. One might think releasing an album full of tracks where each has an astounding vocal climax would be rather precarious. But this album is simply divine, as Florence captures the emotion of the lyrics perfectly. The photos of Florence that accompany the album are equally beautiful. An epic album that is worthy of accolades.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|I read the first book because of all the hype. I didn't care much for the kinky sex but it was interesting.  Everyone said the second book was better, so I purchased it. Sex is getting more traditional but halfway through I gave it up. I like a good story. All the sex got boring! I like sex but this is just too over the top!

There are thrilling parts within the book mostly at the end of it.

1594203334|5.0|... which isn't a bad thing, I don't think. Americans are obviously doing SOMETHING wrong: our children are obese, they never go outside to play, they throw epic tantrums, and mothers are frazzled and losing their minds. Obviously French parents aren't perfect and neither are French kids, but it sounds like they're a heck of a lot better than ours are.<br /><br />American expatriate Druckerman is entertaining, informative, and easily relateable. Reading her book is like having a parenting chitchat with a girlfriend. She doesn't make you feel like you're doing everything wrong because THIS is how it should be done. She's had all the same American experiences, has all the same American prejudices, and has made all the same mistakes. She simply wants to share how the French are doing it differently and getting different results.<br /><br />The French vocabulary that's peppered throughout the book is extremely fun. Druckerman's anecdotes, which are almost always self-deprecating, are comforting and hilarious. I highly recommend this book to any parent with an open mind (or anyone who deals with kids, even if they don't have any of their own) and who is interested in going about things in a non-traditional way.<br /><br />And may I add that the author endeared herself to me forever by actually using the Oxford comma.
B0053JJLLC|5.0|I have been a Crichton fan since Andromida Strain and have since become a writer from the inspiration.  I also am a Richard Preston fan and love his Gideon Series and enjoy his collaborative works with Lincoln Child, and am a fan since reading Hot Zone.  I was eagerly waiting to read Micro after learning of Crichton's untimely death. It is a pleasant romp in the world of nonotechnology and the futuristic world of shrinking machines.  The reader is transported into a malevolent world where up is down and everything is different, and the smallest ant is your worst enemy.  Everything wants to eat you and yet you have great strength and the ability to fall from great heights (relative to a half inch hight) without a scratch.  There is just enough science with powerful yet tiny microscopic machines which can invade a regular sized body via the bloodstream and kill you from the inside out.  The story transported me to H G Wells like landscapes and situations in which you have to use your wits to survive.  Loved the concept and loved the book.<br /><br />Reggie Ridgway Author of In The Midnight Hour and Moon Shadow

B003G4W49C|5.0|INCREDIBLE THAT NO MOVIE HAS YET BEEN MADE. Ridley Scott where are you?<br /><br />This is not only a rite of passage for the kids in Battle School, but for readers as well. We are all pieces on the chessboard; some are Kings some are pawns. It is extremely well written, in fact Card's best writing I suspect (having not read everything), mythic in scope, tight in plot, Stendhalian in detail, Dostoyevskian in character development (mostly kids), original, tight, compelling, relevant, believable, accessible, and one of the best books I have ever read. I have read a lot.<br /><br />P.S. the novels in sequence beyond this one are nowhere near as good; some are even bad. Read this if you haven't.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0812550706 Ender's Game (Ender, Book 1)]]

B005H9B2CE|4.0|If you're a fantasy fan you'll enjoy this movie. The cgi and the sound make positive contributions to the whole and the acting is good for this type of movie. Much of the movie takes place in a small town way out west in the middle of nowhere and the rest of the movie takes place in a cgi world of amazing appearance and dramatic scenery. The technology is pretty much state of the art which is to say good.<br /><br />You may want to view it on streaming video before buying to see if this is one of those movies you want to add to your collection. I've watched it once now and will likely not want to watch it again any time soon.

B00499K9E0|5.0|BBC really hit upon a great idea with a modern version of Sherlock Holmes. It works remarkably well. The show manages to keep the spirit of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes - the genius and eccentricities with modern technology in a 21st century context. What really makes the show work however is the acting. Benedict Cumberbach and Martin Freeman both hit their roles out of the park. Cumberbach in particular is able to tread a careful line between being an eccentric and not looking like a fool. In short, he reeks of Holmes. Freeman has the blandness of Dr. Watson, but also the haunted air of a war veteran. Easily one of the best shows on TV.

B001LF347E|5.0|Merlin seems like an attempt to build off the success of Harry Potter - a TV show about teenage wizards and princes. The series is loosely based on the legend of King Arthur and Merlin in Camelot. I say loosely because it is essentially about the adventures of young Arthur and Merlin. Each episode, the two get into trouble, very much like the early Harry Potter books. However, this show has a lot more spirit than the over-produced Harry Potter movies.<br /><br />What I really appreciate about the show is its maturity, despite its focus on younger characters. The humor is (generally) not slapstick humor, but rather in emphasizing the absurdity of the situations Arthur and Merlin find themselves in. The show gets dark at times and doesn't shy away from death, but also keeps it in good taste - unlike HBO's Game of Thrones, which seems to delight in bloodshed.<br /><br />Merlin also develops its characters, something very hard to do on a TV show. Most TV shows tend to focus on the \\"threat of the week\\" and rush over character development. It's not uncommon for the characters to remain the same throughout. However, Merlin's characters do have their respective journeys. Arthur in particular goes from callous knight to mature ruler with a sense of responsibility. The show also treats the other characters subtly with few heroes and villains. I especially appreciate how Uther Pendragon is never portrayed as simply a villain, but rather a king with heavy emotional and political burdens to bear.<br /><br />Moreover, Merlin stays true to the atmosphere of the Middle-Ages, with a few obvious deviations. I'm not a historian, but do read a lot of history and there isn't too much I've noticed wrong with the historical details of the era. Although given that it's based on the fictional kingdom of Camelot some liberties are expected. Given that this is a TV show, I'm actually quite impressed with the attention to detail in the sets and clothing.<br /><br />Overall, if you like Harry Potter, check this show out.

The layout is very functional and there are many extra compartments to keep items organized and protected.

This backpack definately does the trick.  I am impressed with the quality of construction and attention to detail such as the tough metal cable imbedded in the top hand grip.  This backpack is my top choice.
0345803507|5.0|I will not go into a long review of the book as others have done that already. I can't remember when I have enjoyed a set of books this much. It had it all. Romance, mystery and a great \\"happily ever after\\" ending. I really enjoyed the epilog. It wrapped up a lot of the unanswered questions I had involving other characters in the book. I especially loved the back story of Christians early life with the Greys. I also enjoyed Christians first person perspective on his first meeting with Ana. THAT really brought the book full circle. So in closing, I want to say to my kids who said that it would take me 6 months to finish half of the first book: \\"You were Wrong!\\" I finished all three books in about a month. And to my sainted mother who would have turned 92 today \\"I miss you Mom. You would have loved these books.\\"

B007IXWL2C|3.0|This book was my favorite of a poorly written trilogy. For one, Ana and Christian finally stop having sex long enough to have a conversation outside of email. It had to take Ana being in a coma but thank goodness because the sex scenes were beyond dull and I have never wanted more for two people to \\"just cuddle\\". Two, in the epilogue we get Christian's POV. Because it was Christian as a reader I cared about (at least he was interesting). Hey I personally would have walked out the door and never looked back at this abusive, controlling stalker but since we had him for three books, it was refreshing to leave the whiny, repetitive, second guessing, monotonous, immature POV of Anastasia.
B0089IGUP4|5.0|Last year when singer Brian Fallon released his solo collaboration with guitarist Ian Perkins, \\"Elsie,\\" I was afraid Fallon's steady employer, the Gaslight Anthem, wouldn't be able to match up to such an exquisite record with the coming release of their fourth album in July 2012. Turns out, I had no reason to worry because the foursome's fourth, \\"Handwritten,\\" continues the Gaslight Anthem's winning streak of three great albums in a row.<br />The expansions in mood and arrangement that were explored on Fallon's \\"Elsie\\" project are reflected on such uniquely biting but gorgeous tracks as 'Here Comes My Man,' 'Mae,' and 'Keepsake,' but the album as a whole continues the Gaslight Anthem's mix of cryptic lyrics that reflect old, gritty wise men trapped in the young wiry frames of Fallon, Benny Horowitz, Alex Rosamilia and Alex Levine, with heavy, driving riffs and a relentless rhythm section ('Too Much Blood,' 'Biloxi Parish'). Their straight-forward aspects are never hackneyed or tired, and the lead single, '45,' if used properly, as well as the likes of the title track, 'Mulholland Drive,' 'Desire,' and 'Howl' could steamroll into the mainstream like a juggernaut.<br />A particular pair of songs are worth the price of admission alone - 'National Anthem' and 'Mae,' which are sure to go down in the Gaslight Anthem's canon as two of their most striking songs. They snap the listener briefly from the driving beast-from-the-east lessons on life, and into a stark restraint, especially with the largely acoustic 'National Anthem.'<br />Just as 'We Did It When We Were Young' closed 2010's \\"American Slang\\" on a wonderfully anticlimactic note, 'National Anthem' ends \\"Handwritten\\" in the same manner, a fitting closer for such an accomplished album. This is the Gaslight Anthem's third masterpiece in four years - though the sentiments expressed throughout the disc echo a band that's been in dive bars and dance halls for twenty years, as opposed to not even a decade.<br />No, they're not the new Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band - they're the first Gaslight Anthem.not the new Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band - they're the first Gaslight Anthem.

B0030DHPGQ|4.0|This book offers a number of powerful behavioral tools to use in difficult situations. Several reviewers touch on the strong points of this book already. I concur with almost everything good that's been written about this book. One of the strengths of this book is the interplay between stories, discussion of science, and \\"clinics\\" where the reader is invited to go along and try to solve, with the authors, the protagonist's problems. Using a behavioral approach does indeed lead to significant changes. For a couple stuck in a negative rut this book would be great. Women suffering from domestic violence who find it very hard to leave the abuser, on the other hand, could find the wrong kind of encouragement  in this book. It is precisely because they focus on the \\"bright spots\\" that they stay, often with fatal results.<br /><br />Then there is the guy who used drugs in Viet Nam and to use the language of the 12 step movement, when he comes home, he essentially pulls a \\"geographic\\". People who's drug abuse falls away as easily as is described here are not addicts. Addiction is a brain disease. Animals who are addicted will die of thirst with free access to water because they can only access either the drug or  water not both. Those suffering from real addictions are not helped by looking at the bright spots, tweaking the environment or even pulling a geographic. Attention to people places and things are definitely part of recovery. But before the problem can be addressed, it must be admitted. Half measures are of no avail. Too often have I seen the parents and spouses and children tormented with false and toxic hope to let this one pass without a comment. Nor are most are not helped by an incremental approach. There is a caution that these approaches might not be enough for teens addicted to nicotine. This of course carries the implication that the approaches described might work in adults suffering from nicotine or other addictions.<br /><br />The authors are making their sales pitch so emphasis is not placed on cautions or concerns. The caution needs to be louder and clearer. The authors don't want us all to leave thinking this book solves all problems and if it doesn't its because it was misapplied do they?ir sales pitch so emphasis is not placed on cautions or concerns.

031620157X|4.0|******** 3.5 Stars out of 5 ********<br /><br />Chris Colfer is quite the talented man. From his Golden Globe winning performance on Glee to his background in High School Forensics (Which I myself partake in), he has proven his acting chops over and over again. He also wrote and directed a movie, Struck By Lightning, which has had some early good reviews. But even with all that under his belt, I was still skeptical going into The Land of Stories: The Wishing Spell.<br /><br />Let's get something clear: I am not a Chris Colfer fan. I've despised Glee since about halfway through Season 2 (when I realized it was all downhill form there), and while I think he is a talented actor and good role model, I don't think he is superman or anything.<br /><br />But he isn't a bad writer.<br /><br />The Land of Stories: The Wishing Spell, is about two twins, Alex and Conner, both of whom are living with their single mother who works often. This very tragic, very real opening sets a scene to provide excellent contrast for the eventual fantasy setting of the novel. When Alex and Conner magically wind up in the Land of Stories (I won't spoil how) they mainly have to figure out how to get home. Rumors of a \\"Wishing Spell\\" that grants any wish after gathering a set of items sends the Twins off running all over the kingdom to find those items and get back home.<br /><br />The novel starts strong and things are generally interesting throughout. There are some pleasent twists and turns along the way, but look back up at that plot. Veterans of the fantasy genre and video game enthusiasts will be able to indentify the story as what's called a \\"fetch quest.\\" Essentially, the characters are forced on a journey to collect a bunch of mundane items so that the author/creator can show off their world and creation.<br /><br />At its worst, this story is a cheap fetch quest. A sight-seeing scavenger hunt for the reader to learn about this Land of Stories. While that makes the plot weak, it is supported by the fact that the world Colfer has created is vivid, living, and quite entertaining. Cleverly blending familiar themes and characters with new situations (like a pregnant Cinderella or a Goldilocks on the run), The Land of Stories provides an outstanding respite for not only the protagonists, but also an escape for the readers.<br /><br />But let me stress this again: this is only at the plot's worst.<br /><br />A certain points throughout the novel, the plot hits a high and really, really shines. The item-quest gets buried under a witty, character-filled series that resembles something akin to [[ASIN:1423136802 Percy Jackson and the Olympians]]. Connor's dialogue is refresingly well written, and his wise cracks almost never tire. Alex, on the other hand, is the spitting image of Hermione Granger and Annabeth from PJ, except with little tastes of Colfer's own voice of reason. Connor is clearly the stronger, less derivative character, but both provide some great material for readers of any age.<br /><br />But that ratio, where only one out of every two characters is fascinating and original, kind of echoes throughout the novel. There's \\"Froggy\\" who is literally just Mr. Tumnus from [[ASIN:0061969052 The Chronicles of Narnia]], the council of extremely stereotypical fairies (who are named according to color), and a strangely disgruntled Jack (of Beanstalk fame), who is a cross between Argus Filch and Severus Snape. These are just a few examples of the familiar, almost cliched characters. But due to the theme of this novel (essentially that the stories we read are real and true), and given how heavily it borrows from classical stories to even begin with, this odd mixture of totally new and unique characters and boring, archetypical characters surprisingly works.<br /><br />While Colfer avoids falling victim to the usual ruts of Fantasy no-nos, he does misstep in a few rookie mistakes. There is a term in the industry called a \\"MacGuffin\\", which basically means an item used to force the narrative along without having much significance or explanation of said significance. While some of the items in the book are clear (Rapunzel's hair, Sleeping Beauty's spindle needle), others are offered no explanation and become MacGuffins (the troll king's crown?).<br /><br />Similarly, things often work out a little *too* well for the twins. I kept expecting some big, amazing reveal where, due to the meta- nature of the narrative as a whole, there would be some plot device that would explain the twins amazing luck, which happens again and again and again. Here's a basic passage that illustrate's my point clearly, about 2/3s of the way through the book. For context, the twins have collected like half their stuff and suddenly need to go somewhere else. Tadaa! a boat magically appears on a river that happens to be near them and they can hitch a ride with the owner. Not only does this happen often, but the boat they get into is something out of a fairy tale as well:<br /><br />\\"The boat was small and flat and had just enough room for the three of them. It traveled perfectly along with the river's current, so they didn't even need to row. The twins were enjoying the ride and were able to appreciate the scenery, pointing out every riverside village they saw. It was nice to travel without fear of a wolf or an ogre running up from behind them.\\"<br /><br />This scene also works as an allegory for the work as a whole. The reader is there to enjoy the ride, which fits perfectly. It's not about the method of travel, its about pointing out each attraction Colfer has created, solely for the reader's enjoyment. But in this process, that sense of danger is lost. There is no moment where I was *really* scared for the twin's life or quest. I knew the entire time that they would be fine, because that's how stories like this work. And the whole \\"common happy ending thing\\" does end up hurting and helping the book. It hurts because of predictability, but helps because it says, with a wink, that the book understands its a book.<br /><br />Like I said, very meta.<br /><br />Aside from those complaints and a few questionable writing choices (\\"Conner's mouth hung open like a broken glove compartment\\"), Colfer has created an interesting world, at least one well-developed main character, and provided a good story for years to come. While it doesn't quite top the outstanding heights of [[ASIN:1250010195 The Girl Who Circumnavigated Fairyland in a Ship of Her Own Making]] (which, in my opinion, was the last great entry in this genre), he does make a name for himself as an author, nor just a gimmick. I'll be on the lookout for the next one, but being 18 years old, I don't know who I would recommend this novel to. Not quite complex enough for adults, but still a little too mature for especially young kids, this book will have a hard time finding an audience.

B000NH7SZ0|1.0|I bought this Memory upgrade at the same time I bought the Brother HL-4570CDW Printer from Amazon.  The first memory module I received would not be recognized by the printer (and yes, it was installed properly).  Thinking the part might be defective, I returned the first memory module for another identical (same part #).  The second one does not work either.<br /><br />Went to Kingston site and searched for printer memory... the results of the search on the Kingston website for a Brother HL-4570CDW printer comes up with a different part number (even though Brother's user manual also references the KTH-LJ2015/255 part number as the 256 upgrade). KINGSTON website says for the Brother HL-4570CDW color laser printer; 256MB Module - DDR2 533MHz, the Part Number is: KTB-HL533/256.  This is an entirely different part number than AMAZON site directly recommended that I add to my purchase when I bought the printer from them.  Now I am having to return the 2nd SO-DIMM memory module to AMAZON, and will have to try to get the correct part number that KINGSTON site says is needed to upgrade the Brother HL-4570CDW printer memory.  If the KTB-HL533/256 part does not work, then maybe the printer I got is defective.  Frustrated to say the least.

B004PGO25O|5.0|I tend to grab any creativity book I see. As I was getting ready to buy Steven Pressfield's Turning Pro, I saw Do the Work and realized I'd somehow missed it.  Where The Art of War introduced us to Resistance and the importance of fighting it, Do the Work goes further. Pressfield wisely says, \\"A child has no trouble believing the unbelieveable, nor does the genius or madman...it's only you and I, with our big brains and tiny hearts, who doubt and overthink and hesitate.\\"    This book helps you get past the stuck places, take action and finish projects. It's about letting go of the habit of overthinking and just doing the work.    Some reviewers have claimed that Pressfield advocates not thinking. Nothing could be further from the truth. He instead talks about not overthinking, and about when to work and when to think.    I'll be recommending this book to all my coaching clients in the future.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|I saw this movie in theaters twice so of course I knew I was going to buy it but even after getting it in the mail and watching it again, it still got me.  This movie is just so intense and realistic, you can tell that these are true SEALS rather than some crummy actors trying to pretend they know what is going on.  I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone and everyone because I honestly think that anyone can appreciate the story and true masterpiece this is.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Love this addicting game!  A great spin on the Angry Birds original game.  Nice graphics and fun for all ages.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|Even though I bought this movie for my husband, when we finally got it I was so stuck on it.  The story line is non-stop laughs and you can't help but sit and get drawn in.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who has a quirky sense of humor, its worth the buy.
B008MEM24S|1.0|I purchased this app for my daughter and have not been able to play it on our kindle. I was charged but the app is no where on my device. I want my money back. Will be hesitant to purchase future apps.
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|Been following Joe since his James Gang days and this comeback CD ranks up there with any of his former music when he was in his heyday. His lyrics show his maturation as a person and as an artist. There wasn't one song on the CD that I didn't care for. In fact the last song (often a filler), India, is one of my favorites. I was back and forth over whether or not to go see Joe in concert next month. After a 2nd listen to this CD, I decided to go see him.
B000Q6GUTI|1.0|A hundred percent Hollywood crap, unless one enjoys completely unrealistic, shoot-em-up, never in a million years could happen, kind of flick. I decided to watch<br />it after seeing it had a four stars rating on this web site. So it makes me wonder, are these reviews written by fifteen year old boys, taking a break from playing their favorite war video game, or what?<br />As far as I'm concerned, the acting is atrocious, ( when it breaks out at all.), the plot is ridiculous, the special effects commonplace, and I don't recall any musical score, ( I'm laughing to myself.).<br /> It deserves less than a star due to the fact there wasn't even any redeeming nudity or passionate sex to save it, or at least give it a star.. To sum it up, if you can't tell by now, a waste of time! Watch Rambo again,<br />or maybe Rocky again instead.
0679731725|5.0|THE REMAINS OF THE DAY is the story of Stevens (you never know his first name), the dedicated butler in the life long service of Lord Darlington and his relationship with Miss Kenton, the woman that served with him for a number of years as the housekeeper at the Darlington manor.  Starting in the late 1920's, the story takes Stevens to essentially the end of an era in the early 1950's.  His huge staff is gone and the manor house is now owned by an American.  Stevens like furniture and fixtures - \\"went with the house.\\"<br /><br />A man who prides himself on professionalism and dignity and striving to be one of the great butlers of his time, Stevens, in these declining years, is faced with the questin of what he has done with his life.  He has no family, no friends, no hobbies and is left with just the memories of what was and what could have been.  There is a bit of foreshadowing early in the book when Stevens' father comes to work at Darlington. He has been a butler for his entire career but he comes to work at Darlingtion as an under butler and then just as a servant because he has no place else to go.  He is a tragic figure who revels in the memories of days gone by as a butler.<br /><br />At the beginning of Downton Abbey we see the life style of the British upper class in its golden age.  But as the story progresses we see the servants attempting to get out of service and asserting their rights as workers and as humans.  They want to marry, they want to control their own lives to the chagrin of the head butler, Mr. Carson and the housekeeper, Mrs. Hughes. Stevens and Kenton are very much counterparts of Carson and Hughes who have given up their chance as romance and families and are totally dedicated to the households they serve.<br /><br />The plot reveals that Lord Darlington has been a Nazi sympathizer in the period leading up to World War II and dies in disgrace.  Although Stevens tries to justify Lord Darlington's positions about Germany in his own mind, when the occasion arises after the war for Stevens to be identified with Lord Darlington, like the New Testament story of Peter, Stevens denies Darlington - three times.<br /><br />Told in the first person as Stevens makes a road trip in his new master's car to \\"see the countryside\\" and to visit Miss Kenton who left service years ago and married, Stevens has some vague idea that she will return and things will be as they were.  During the trip he comes to realize what a sheltered life he has lived.  He interacts with some working class Brits who mistake his for a \\"gentleman.\\"  Even his conversation is difficult because he admits to himself that he has never learned to engage in small talk or banter.  He realizes that he cannot live vicariously off the past.  While he was on the fringe  of the aristrocracy he was not a part of it.<br /><br />One of the many themes of this Booker Award winning book is the decline of the British aristocracy along with the question of what is loyalty and dignity.  The reader will likely attempt to put themselves in the place of the people in the servant class.  Is that the only life style that they knew?  What would you have done?  Should they have left the security of thier positions?  And one wonders about the British aristocracy.  Did it ever occur to them what they were doing to these people?  Did they merely see them as pieces of furniture -  as things to be used and then thrown away?  Although the servant class could have left, in many ways they were not much better off than the slaves in the American  South.  But as we see in Downton Abbey, World War 1 and World War II bring on changes.<br /><br />There's a Peggy Lee song from the 1960's, \\"Is That All There Is?\\"  At the end of the book, Stevens is sitting on a bench watching the sun go does, essentially asking, it that all there is?  Was his dedication and loyalty worth it?  Was he just a commodity, a window dressing for Lord Darlington to use?  Should he have spoken up when he wastold to fire the Jewish maids - just because they were Jewish?<br /><br />This book is only 245 pages long.  The 1993 movie staring Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson follows the novel very closely.  One wonders if at the end of the day some of the characters at Downton Abbey will have the same reflections as Stevens.<br /><br />This would be a great book for a book club.  It raises so many questions for discussion.  How does Stevens compare with the person who has who has worked for the same company for his entire career and is then let go.  And what about a person who worked for a company and then finds out that the company polluted and caused the deaths of many people or made defective products?  Would you have had the guts to leave or speak up?  There are just a few of the the questions raised by this amazing and thought provoking book that should be on everyone's must read list.told to fire the Jewish maids - just because they were Jewish?<br /><br />This book is only 245 pages long.

B008JGSM6G|1.0|the challenges are so hard I can never get it like is so new to the game the jumbo pack is so dam heard. :(
B005Q1W10A|5.0|If you enjoyed Downton Abbey as much as I did, I suggest that you watch the movie or read the book  THE REMAINS OF THE DAY by Kazuo Ishiguro.  This book was published in 1988 and won the Booker Prize.  Written in the first person by Mr. Stevens - a counterpart of Mr. Carson in Downton, it shows a much darker side of life for domestic starting in the mid 1920. The novel's Miss Kenton is the counterpart to Downton's Mrs. Hughes and the interplay between the housekeeper and the butler is another view of what could have happened between Carson and Mrs. Hughes at Downton.  At the time of the writing of the story in the late early 1950's it's pretty much the end of the era for the large manor houses with big staffs and you see the decline.  The book raises some interesting questions about both the servants and their dedication and the people that employed them.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|This book had so much potential, but fell flat. I loved the premise of the story but only continued reading the story because I wanted to know if Jacob did this awful act or not.  The characters were not fully developed; I didn't get to know Jacob. The trial ended as I suspected it would, but the events which happened afterwards were a HUGE disappointment. I do not know now so many people rated this book with such high praise. I was a little angry that I had wasted my time reading this book.
B006QANR5I|5.0|I boutht both seasons of this story.  It was an enjoyable several evenings of TV my wife and I both enjoyed them immensely.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|thiz game is cool but it take alot of lookin after if u forget about it u may lose the babies
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Wow I love this app! its really fun and exciting and I love the challenge and its so addicting I play it nonstop but I get angry if I loose 5 STARS!!!!!!!
B0063IH60K|2.0|I do not like having some singles pictures come up every time i try to play this app. there should be some way to turn this off
0345803485|5.0|Can't understand the closed mindedness of some of the reviewers.  I read all three books and did not want the trilogy to end.  There is so much more to the book than the erotic aspects.  Loved the characters!  Open up your minds ladies and pay attention to the actual story.
B005D646RE|4.0|The concept for this show sounded so depressing, I just didn't think I'd care for it. But once started, we couldn't stop. It's just like nothing else we've ever seen. The characters here live way out on such a far-flung, precarious, insanely terrifying edge of the world that it's difficult to comprehend. But, truly the most amazing storyline is how the dangerous, wounded creatures populating this alternate dimension are able to blend into the mundane work-a-day world that surrounds them.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|This is a great collection of some of the best of the 80's rock.  And who knew Tom Cruise could sing like that?!!  He's as good as the original recordings, as are most of the artists on the CD.  You won't be disappointed in this one!
B00499K9E0|5.0|A modern timeframe brings these old stories forward and manages to refresh them to an astonishing degree. The two main characters are delightful, and we find this Sherlock far darker and deeply strange than ever before imagined. Ambiguous in many respects, luckily he has the capable, more functional doctor to accompany him on his journey. The humble doctor, a recent veteran of war, quietly damaged in his own ways, presses on without complaint to get the job done. Look forward to more of this very unique show.
B007SGM084|5.0|I was recommended this book by a friend and was skeptical.  The book was quite graphic in the characters love life.  That is a change from a romance that leads you along on a rope through the whole book and then at the end the couple gets together.  The \\"Fifty Shades\\" trilogy is much different and was a nice change.  The characters slowly developed their love for each other and you were able to see it flourish through the books and in detail.  I would read another story like this in a heartbeat.
B005LAIGW8|1.0|So many questions with this flick... How could Nicholas Cage put his name on this?  How could they make such a horrible movie after the first one was so good?? It's not that it was the worst sequels ever, it's ONE OF THE WORST MOVIE'S EVER!!!
B008FRFN7A|5.0|kindle fire perfect. easiest remote print I have ever had. downloaded the app; chose to print from gallery; choose the photo and instant print. no sign in. no tweaking.  perfect
B004LWZW88|4.0|I loved Puss in the Shrek films so I was anxious to see this, and I was not disappointed!  As much as Donkey is a great comedy foil for Shrek, a feature-length movie featuring Donkey (even including other Shrek characters) would be quite over-the-top.  Not so with Puss.<br /><br />Kids can enjoy this on a totally different level than adults who will catch on to the secondary (subtle?) innuendos.  The choice of Humpty-Dumpty as a character was surprising; it worked much better than I expected (and in retrospect, I'm very grateful a rodent was NOT chosen as the antagonist LOL).<br /><br />It's definitely a movie that can be enjoyed more than once and has a catchy soundtrack as well.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|my 5year old loves this game. super cute with great graphics! we like that it follows along with the movie characters and doesn't change anything. fun!!
B000N4SHPS|3.0|Otherwise known as Rocky VI, this Stallone driven drama is not too bad at all. Having milked the franchise over the years Stallone is still able to pull the heartstrings. This one focuses on Rocky's comeback from retirement in an exhibition match with cocky prize fighter. You are on Rocky's side all the way as this capitalises as the battler making it good against all the odds, in other words the same formula as Rocky's I to V. Somehow it still works and this one is quite different than the others as Stallone really is getting too old so there is no denying where the agenda of the film lies.<br /><br />The fight sequences are suped up with music video style jump cuts, slow mo, razor sharp edits and some chilling camera work. It again works fine. Rocky is reduced to a shell of what he used to be since his fighting days but the drawcard of the film is to see how he overcomes the odds to get back in the ring and make a contest of himself. The acting is top notch, Adrian is featured in dream sequences showing how Rocky focuses on the past. It is great to see old timer coach Burt in his reprised role again. I like the scenes where Rocky is making friends with a new girl and her son, he seems genuine and is very honourable in his intentions.<br /><br />It is a likeable film, no swearing at all, and just a bit of blood when they get in the ring and slam each other into kingdom come. But that is expected. The final credits are fun showing many ordinary people making the famous run up the steps and, yes, Rocky music and the famous run up the steps happens from the big man himself, as well as thumping meat, downing raw eggs and running in the snow with his pet dog Punchy. It does not disappoint as a homage to the old Rocky's and Stallone in a hat looks the same as ever; the no good bum who fights for his passion, and it is not all about winning. I was generally delighted with the pleasant tone of the film and the uplifting message of hope and courage.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I think this is a fun game to play. It can become very addicting. I only have one complaint ... I wish it would give you a hint or allow you to undo your last entry. It's a little annoying to have redo the whole puzzle to undo a mistake.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really enjoy playing the games on this app. I really don't have a favorite game yet. I like them all!
B005LAII0S|3.0|This is a so-so production of the Snow White story.  A quick synopsis for those who were able to avoid the story or been indoctrinated by Disney. The King becomes a father. The wife dies in childbirth. By accident or by design the king marries a witchy woman. She's so vain she thinks this story is about her doesn't she? Naturally the daughter Snow White (Lily Collins) outshines the Queen and must be dispatched. The tale contains a prince that cannot stay clothed, giant dwarfs, and an evil beast of the forest.<br /><br />In one scene Nathan Lane is turned into a cockroach. I thought it was a jab at Franz Kafka.<br /><br />They tried too hard to be cutesy. I must say the absence of animation or songs was refreshing. As usual Julia Roberts made a nice witchy woman. Unfortunately it's also one of those productions that contain ancient close and contemporary snotty language not potty mouth just snotty.<br /><br />It's worth a one-time view to see an alternate version of the story then it is forgettable.
B00884GR0W|5.0|this is an awesome game worth the money but for some reason I cant craft a crafting table but besides that its awesome a must get (if u have money)
B008K9UZY4|5.0|What is the best way to play Sonic CD? On a Sega Mega CD while eating potato chips. What about if you do not own the rare Mega CD? This is the next best thing. You get it on an HD screen, soundtrack options, and portability. It is not nearly as good as Sonic 3 and Knuckles or Sonic 2, but it is still good. The time travel adds a lot of variety.<br />Reviewing each aspect of Sonic CD:<br /><br />Level Design<br /><br />Palmtree Panic- 8/10: YAY! Although I prefer Green Hill Zone, this is quite nice. Travelling to the past made the entire zone prehistoric. Travelling to the bad future had all of the trees burning.<br /><br />Collision Chaos- 7/10: Collision Chaos is obviously a redo of Sonic 1's Spring Yard Zone. Everything bounces Sonic into the air, which can be frustrating.<br /><br />Tidal Tempest- 7/10: Guess what? This one is another knockoff! This one feels exactly like Labyrinth Zone from Sonic 1.<br /><br />Quartz Quadrant- 6/10: Finally, a zone that does not copy Sonic 1, and as a result is not half bad.<br /><br />Wacky Workbench- 5/10: AHHHH! You can not touch the zone's bottom or it will either zap Sonic or bounce him up and out of control! I don't know how I beat this, but it is not too bad. At least this is something original that I have not seen in any other Sonic game.<br /><br />Stardust Speedway- 9/10: This is best zone in the game. Spotlights beam, water reflects the buildings, and it felt really relaxing.<br /><br />Metallic Madness- 8/10: The biggest maze ever. Sonic shrinks for some reason, and the traps are extreme. The second act forces you to move right when the level starts or Sonic will be crushed by giant pillars.<br /><br />That is every level in the game. Pretty interesting even if some feel ported directly from Sonic 1.<br /><br />Graphics- 7/10: It looks like Sonic 1, and did not impress me at first. But then the backgrounds started impressing me. They were animated and gave the zones a lot of depth. Stardust Speedway had spotlights in the background that shined on Sonic. I noticed Wacky Workbench had flickering lights at the top of the level. Little things like that made a difference in my opinion.<br /><br />Plot- 6/10: Many people on Amazon said it had no plotline, but it does. Every 100 years Little Planet comes over Time Lake, and then it is possible to travel time. Sonic and Amy go to check it out, but Eggman has chained up Little Planet! Sonic to the rescue! It was interesting because you see Amy at the end of Palmtree Panic. Amy then follows Sonic to Collision Chaos where Metal Sonic kidnaps her. Then Sonic saves Amy at the end of Stardust Speedway and they kiss and run off to Metallic Madness.<br /><br />Bosses- 6/10: The Eggman fights were not Sonic CD's strong point. I only liked 3/7 of the fights. Of course I have to include Metal Sonic, he was pretty awesome and challenging. It took me 1 hour to beat him.<br /><br />Japanese Soundtrack- 10/10: This is the best part of the game. Catchy music. Palmtree Panic opens with a \\"YAY!\\". If you get to the bad future of Palmtree Panic it opens with a groan followed by drill sounds. Tidal Tempest had running water in the theme. Stardust Speedway was all about record scratches and jazz. Metallic Madness even had a short voclaized rap sequence.<br /><br />USA Soundtrack- 7/10: So Sega thought \\"HEY! This is too catchy!\\" and changed the entire soundtrack for the US. I like the Japanese version better, but the US one focused on tracks that fit the themes better and had more rock. It is interesting how one zone can have a completly different mode when it's track is changed. Stardust Speedway was all about techno power over in Japan, but in the US its theme was more relaxed and balanced, which made the zone seem calmer.<br /><br />I do recommend Sonic CD for Android, as you can't beat the price and portability. For people who downloaded this off of Google Play, it had a major bug on the Kindle Fire: the game only took up half of the screen! This has been fixed. I only have one comment, could Sega rename it? It is not on a CD anymore, so it should be called something like Sonic Download or Sonic Once-On-A-CD. LOL!n fixed. I only have one comment, could Sega rename it? It is not on a CD anymore, so it should be called something like Sonic Download or Sonic Once-On-A-CD. LOL!
B0063GORYU|4.0|graphics are clear and fast. my only complaint would be if you are into keeping up your stats, the cards don't always land where you want to place them. maybe it's me.... it's super fun anyway.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I really got caught up in the story as it built through the 5 parts of this series but it is definitely not for the claustrophobic.  The characters were quickly developed and relatable and the situation of man living completely underground because we've destroyed the atmosphere is not that hard to imagine.  I would love to see a part 6 or 2nd series about Silo 17 but, that being said, the series came to a satisfying end.  An enjoyable read.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I absolutely loved this entire trilogy!! While the grammar was not perfect, I was able to over look it because the storyline was well developed.
B008MEM24S|4.0|my kids love this game, but don't like that you need a wifi connection to play. can't play it on my tab on road trips.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book while not written the best was still fantastic!! I was left wanting more.  I only purchased this book unsure that I would like the trilogy and quickly had to purchase the second and third book.  I could not put all three of the books down!!
B000007UTN|5.0|the album arrived earlier than expected and in perfect conditions. there is nothing to say about the album, because is Radiohead, men!

B004LWZW2E|5.0|Insidious can be summed up in two words: awesome and creepy. The story, with a boy who inexplicably falls into a coma one night, his parents weighed down under caring for their comatose son, and the unexplained 'bumps in the night' all fall into place when it is revealed that the boy - Dalton - is being followed by the spirits of the dead, accurately summed up by the film's tagline: \\"IT'S NOT THE HOUSE THAT'S HAUNTED\\". I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes psychological horror and the movie did pretty good at achieving that, and without copious amounts of blood and gore (virtually none, in fact), somewhat rare for horror films these days. The appearance of Lin Shaye - the 'Teacher' in the original A Nightmare on Elm Street - should be a familiar one for horror fans in general.<br /><br />The film arrived three days before the earliest delivery date, and in good condition. A+ to the seller.
B005LAII0I|1.0|There is nothing about this film that is interesting, entertaining or recognizable as decent film. Not even sure where the male lead was dug up but must have to do with his father's money because there is nothing else to recommend him. The female lead is simply not interesting and Julia, dear Julia...can't you find something more worthy or your time. The only thing mildly interesting were the dwarfs and that's stretching the point. Can we have our money back pleeeeese?
B0071XO8RA|5.0|So into the story that I couldn't stop reading and ignored my iPad's repeated low power warnings.  Suddenly my iPad ran out of juice. That's how good this book is!
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|***************  SPOILER ALERT  ****************************<br /><br />During the first two books, Katniss's primary concern was the well being of those who she loved, like Prim and Peeta. Somehow in this book her motivation was replaced with \\"I am going to kill Snow.\\" Perhaps, she realized that Prim outgrew her protection, and no longer her concern. Perhaps, the nightmares and dimming of Peeta's light drove her off the edge.<br /><br />With all 12 districts under control of the rebels, the Capitol's fall was inevitable. But, when Peeta arrived, Katniss still made the killing of Snow (a useless mission) the priority, not the well being of Peeta. Why wasn't Katniss reaching out to Peeta? Was her kiss another calculation of hers to disarm a ticking bomb? How could she let Peeta walk on his own in the midst of chaos in the Capitol?<br /><br />Coin did not deserve an assassination. She did opt for a more democratic process, giving the Victors the final votes on the Hunger Games. She let Katiss shoot Snow (if she wanted to).  She held up all ends of her bargain. Violence is not the solution.  Did Katniss not learn nothing from putting down her bow and arrow in District 2?<br /><br />If Susan Collin's main message is that war has damaging effects on the psychology of youth, she has done it poorly. What the last few chapters show are Katniss's lack of concern for Peeta and her recklessness that got members in 451 killed. The blood of Finnick Odair and others is on her hands. Haymitch is right, Peeta is too good for her.

No depth, very poorly written, completely irritating dialog between characters, not to mention how everything was \\"grey\\"...... Really???......and the sex scenes were just stupid. Spend you money on a good book, not this one. I removed mine from my kindle less than halfway through. Awful.

0812550706|5.0|This book is a classic. Ender Wiggin, child prodigy, is taken at the age of six to begin his journy to become humanities last against an alien race. The games he plays train him. The games also seek to control him. You don't have to be a sci-fi fan to enjoy this book.
B0028MBKVG|4.0|...the book is clearly sensationalized and exaggerated in places. I recommend the book though. There are plenty of interesting & supporting studies referenced.
B0086700CM|4.0|it is a pointless game...but it is fun and very addictive.  I find my self shouting at the characters and getting mad when they jump instead of duck :) a request to the developers...make a &quot;back or cancel&quot; button when you use your coins. with this being a pure touch game..when scrolling thru the options to see what I can get...my finger inadvertently &quot;purchased &quot; an option that I wasn't trying to get. it cost me 12000 coins and I was 3k away from getting karma le! (aargh) please fix this so if u do accidently select something you can back out of the option.  other than that...wonderfully fun and addictive
1594203334|5.0|This engaging and belly-laugh producing account of one mother's experience parenting in France is sure to make American parents think twice about our assumptions that \\"pain equals gain\\" when it comes to parenting. Succumbing to your child's every whim not only does a disservice to yourself (and is more likely to leave you on the verge of sanity) but is a disservice to your child. French parenting emphasizes educating children in the art of patience, self-control and fitting into the family rather than learning that he or she and his/her fancies are the center of it. Add this basic philosophy and France's incredible child care and maternal support system (there is an actual government department of Mother and Infant Protection!) and you have a recipe for healthy kids and families. Americans and American policy has a lot to learn from this delightful book!

B007MAETA8|1.0|I have listened to this CD several times hoping I would like it more and more, but it's just not going to happen. The harmonica Neil Young sound alike is maddening. After decades of hearing Neil Young, Almond Bros. Eagles, etc. we need something new not clone music. Which is what this sounds like to me. I've heard it all before again and again. So disappointed! Continuum is my favorite John Mayer CD and bought this based on his talent in that particular CD. Should have paid attention to the reviews.

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Nothing I say here hasn't already been said by others, but after reading this book and its reviews, I had to comment.<br /><br />First, I have to say that the first two books are masterfully done. Each character has a purpose, has a reason for being in Katniss's world. I think this is highlighted by the fact that some tributes are never named because the book is written in her 1st person perspective, and actually adds to that closeness of the reader to Katniss's thoughts.<br /><br />But in this book, the author seems to show that she has trouble weaving a story of conflict and loss outside of the Games. There is no structure, characters lose their strengths and purpose for being in Katniss's world.<br /><br />Now the two arguments I've seen in the reviews have been that one has to be or know someone in the military to understand what the author was trying to convey in this book and that it's unfair to compare Katniss (in this book) to Twilight's Bella.<br /><br />The thing about reading this book and a military background is if the reader can't understand the feelings and actions of the character(s) then that is the fault of the author, not the reader. It's the authors responsibility to connect the reader to the emotions, extreme and subtle, behind the actions of the characters. In the first two books, I felt the pain and loss of Katniss and all those in her world. It did not require me to have lived or known someone to have lived in the districts of Panem. Nor did it require me or someone I've known to experience the Games to feel these things with the characters. The author obviously missed her mark when so many feel their beloved characters withered away rather than became stronger, more flawed (more complex) characters in the end.<br /><br />And I have to agree with the comparison of Katniss to Bella. Katniss had become a shadow of herself in this book. She seemed to whine or pout throughout this book. There were times when I could picture her stomping her footand holding her breath at just how unfair life was for her. This was not the Katniss of the first two books that tried to make the best out of what precious little she could get. This was not the Katniss who instinctively put the needs of those she loved above her own. And she respected anyone that did the same. In an everyone-out-for-themselves world, this was a huge strength of character.<br /><br />The only selfishness she'd shown in the first two books (and her backstory) was when she was ready to give up because she could not see any other way to help her loved ones, and even that is only slightly selfish. So the change was like night and day.<br /><br />I wish this book had the characters grow from what they originally were, flaws and all, to prove the author's point subtly. Not become completely different characters just to prove her point. And as others mentioned, I wish more focus was on how Katniss and her husband rebuilt their relationship and their world.<br /><br />In all, I think the author had very strong emotions connected to war and those emotions made her forget that it was the characters, not the war, that was crucial to the story
B007CKHPD6|1.0|Wow, that really sounds harsh but here's why I say it:<br /><br />Huge fan of Yessongs the album and film. I'm not a recording engineer, but as we all know, the sound mix on this has always been rather dull, and it doesn't sound like they made any attempt to channel this properly for 5.1. (Like I said, I'm not a pro, don't know if it was even possible.)<br /><br />I watched this movie after having listened to the Flaming Lips amazing Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots in 5.1 and the contrast was very sad.<br /><br />*If you already own a decent copy of this excellent concert movie just stick with it.

B00785P2QC|4.0|I like the game but wish I was able to turn the structures.  Also think the bigger projects are too expensive.  Hate running out of energy!
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book is an excellent guide with remarkable benefits. Items are easily obtainable but a little more expensive. Compared to what<br />Is available in the market, fully worth .
B006LSZECO|4.0|Some books are impossible to review accurately with the risk of spoilers. In the case of Gone Girl, Gillian Flynn's third crime thriller, the trouble isn't so much that I have to give away specific plot details as that I have to discuss the narrative structure in a way that might make alert readers able to predict some of those details when they otherwise wouldn't have. Those who want to experience the novel without such inadvertent guidance should avoid reading beyond the first paragraph of this review, and content themselves with this capsule statement: Gone Girl is a compelling page-turner, but turns away from the insight into real human behavior that might have made it a literary as well as a plot-driven triumph.<br /><br />That ultimate lack of insight is all the more disappointing because the book initially suggests a nuanced and thoroughly contemporary character study. The protagonists, Nick Dunne and his wife Amy, were writers in New York City until the economic downturn left them both jobless. The nearly-simultaneous news that Nick's mother was terminally ill made a move back to his Missouri hometown seem like a good idea. But within two years their already-fragile relationship is so strained that when Amy disappears on the morning of their fifth wedding anniversary, Nick soon becomes the prime suspect. His first-person narration of events after the disappearance alternates with Amy's diary entries about their life together, and between the two accounts there are enough questions raised to make a reader wonder whether Nick, an admitted liar, is really capable of murder.<br /><br />This first section of the novel, which takes up about half of its 400 pages, is a brilliant blend of plot development and character work. Both Nick and Amy are complicated, frustrating, ultimately sympathetic human beings, and the emotional dynamics of their marriage, which threaten to undermine their obvious mutual love, reflect modern problems of gender, gender roles, and sexism. Nick is a bit of a cad, spoiled, selfish, sometimes petulant, often blind to his wife's needs, while Amy is so concerned with being a generous, understanding, non-traditional wife that she can't bring herself to admit the existence of those needs. All this plays out against the backdrop of the uncertain modern economy, in which not just the Dunnes but their neighborhood of abandoned McMansions, their town of unemployed, rootless indigents, seem permanently perched on the brink of disaster. If the rest of the book had maintained this emphasis on character and setting, Gone Girl would have been one of my favorite novels of the year.<br /><br />Instead, the halfway point brings a plot twist that throws everything you think you know into doubt. As a story development this is mostly well achieved, though one of the devices used verges on a narrative cheat and I'm not sure of the plausibility of certain points. The problem is that the revelation completely undermines the established characterization, and what replaces it isn't nearly as interesting as the Nick and Amy you thought you were reading about. Personalities like the one that dominates the second half of Gone Girl do exist, but they're rare in real life and overexposed in crime fiction, where they allow for twisty plotting and chilling (but ultimately less than profound) character study. As a story this one is indeed satisfying-- I read the last 200 pages in a single sitting-- but it doesn't really have anything to say about the world we live in. Near the end there's something approaching a theme about the nature of love, but the character and plot points involved are so exaggerated that its deeper relevance is minimal.<br /><br />Here as in her first two books, Gillian Flynn is a sharp, distinctive, often funny writer whose prose is compulsively readable without sacrificing character voice. She knows how to contrive and select details and incidents that make her protagonists distinctive as individuals yet recognizable as people dealing with universal human dilemmas. And she can shape a plot like nobody's business. Unfortunately, in the case of Gone Girl the latter skill works to the detriment of the former ones, with story swallowing theme and character. The book does too much too well not to earn a recommendation, but it's also a deeply frustrating experience.

1594200823|3.0|\\"A single strawberry contains about five calories. To get that strawberry from a field in California to a plate on the east coast requires 435 calories of energy.\\"<br /><br />I have yet to read the book (but i do plan to) but this caught my eye.  There are about 25 medium size strawberries per pound and a gallon of diesel contains 35000 Calories.  I assume Mr. Pollan is using food calories here for both the strawberry and the transport energy.  The typical 18 wheeler truck gets anywhere from 150 to 190 cargo ton-miles per gallon of diesel.  To transport that strawberry then, with the truck filled to capacity, 3500 miles to the Northeast we then have 35000*3500/((150 to 190)*2000 (# of pounds per ton) * 25 (# of berries per pound) ).  This gives us anywhere from 12.9 to 16.4 Calories to transport that strawberry across the lower United States.  You can usually forgive someone being off a few percent due to rounding, etc, but this is a miss to the tune of about 29 to 1 !<br /><br />Granted that my calculations only include the big long distance cross country leg and not the transport from the field to the 18 wheeler and then to the customer.  But, then, the local farmer too has to load up the strawberries, get them to the store and you still have to get them home.  So that sounds like a wash to me.

0316017930|2.0|I was looking forward to reading this book, which is my first of Gladwell book.  I have known about him and his books for years, and I expected a thought-provoking, engaging read.  My main criticism is that he doesn't seem to give the reader much credit; opting for simplistic, repetitive narratives that back his thesis about success.  Really, there's no arguing his point that success has much more to do with merit and natural talent alone.  It's just that he goes for these golly-gee type lead-ins that, and in most cases his point is pretty short and easy to understand but he really draws it out and repeats himself and states the obvious over and over again.<br /><br />I pretty much agree with a reviewer a few down from me that if you are mathematically or scientifically inclined or trained, you will be a bit frustrated by the crawling pace of his text.  Also, this reads to me like an author trying hard to make a full book out of something that just doesn't have the intellectual depth or merit to deserve it.<br /><br />That said, it's an easy, entertaining read that is almost a version of a summer, beach read non-fiction book.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|I purchased the Apple iPad Camera Connection Kit with a bit of concern as I wasn't sure if it would work with my trusty Nikon D100 (which uses CF cards, so the card reader isn't an option.  My iPad2 is up-to-date with iOS 5.1.1.<br /><br />It read the considerably large number of photos on the card quickly, allowed me to select one (as a test) and uploaded it into photo (under imports).  I'm wanting to be able to do blog posts (via Blogsy) on my Blogger blog while traveling, so it looks like this will work just fine -- and the photos look good on the iPad, of course.  I haven't yet tried to do any cropping or photo-editing on the iPad, but at least the system looks like it will work.<br /><br />I'm giving it 5 stars for now!

B004ZRV3AU|5.0|I bought this product to cut some bottles for my wedding.  It took a little practice to get the process down, but once we got the hang of it, it was pretty easy (and fun).  We cut 20 bottles in a couple hours.  Most of them had a perfect cut (when they didn't, it was usually due to user error).  There were some bottles that took a little extra effort to break along the score, so we went back and forth dunking them in ice water and hot water.  It seemed like we were most successful when the temperature gradient was high.  I thought a lot about how to cut our bottles, and I feel confident that this was the easiest and most cost effective way to do it.  I highly recommend this product.

0451169514|5.0|I read this book because I had heard that it is arguably one of Stephen King's best books. I was a little hesitant to read IT because of its length but I am sure glad that I did. Both the story and the characters are outstanding. I was hoping that IT would be a little bit scarier however there certainly are some creepy scenes in the novel. Like I said the book is great but I still considered giving the book only four stars. There is one particular scene towards the ending of the story that really bothered me. Anyone who has read IT probably knows which scene I am talking about. I felt that it was completely unnecessary and very disturbing given the context.....then again we are talking about Stephen King, I should have expected it.

031620157X|4.0|Colfer's take on the fairy tale characters is interesting for the most part, delving into the depths of some of the characters such as Goldilocks, Red Riding Hood, and The Evil Queen; But there is much that leaves the reader wanting.<br /><br />The Land of Stories: The Wishing Spell is written very simply for the reasons of being a children's novel (a large one, at that), but sometimes the simplistic writing can become rather plain. However, the pace of the story is relatively fast in the sense that there is plenty of action involved. The children travel to different parts of the world and the adventures they go on are fun to read.<br /><br />The story is a little predictable at times but very charming, with the major plot twists of the story very captivating. Overall, this book is a good read-- But I would probably not read it again if it were not for Colfer's name attached to this title.
B00846REIS|4.0|I didnt think this book was as good as the Grey Series. It follows along the same story line. I will read the next book when it is released. October or November I believe. I have friends that thought Bared was the better book.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I borrowed this from the library.  When I started this book I had low expectations. But what a wonderful story of two people who have their own issues and upbringing getting together and trying to be better together, I expected a lot more sex then there was and that's one reason I thought I wouldn't like it. This is more for older women,the younger may not understand the nuance. So if you expect lots of sex and D&s,you will be disappointed. Gave it 5 stars so people will make there own judgement. Don't read it if your expecting lots of sex.
B008F5YDRI|5.0|I watched \\"Fishing for Salmon in the Yemen\\" while on a long plane trip. I enjoyed the movie so much I watched it twice on the trip out and then once more on my trip home. The casting of the movie was outstanding, even the smaller characters contributed nicely. Emily Blunt and Ewan McGregor play their roles to perfection and have wonderful chemistry together. Ms. Blunt is one of today's best young actresses and few can match her depth in romantic comedies. Ewan McGregor is equally adept and his character's transformation is the film's centerpiece. While Blunt and McGregor carry the movie, Kristin Scott Thomas provides the funniest moments.  She is hilarious as the hard driving press secretary for the British Prime Minister. Amr Waked plays his part to the tee as the mystical Sheik, though I wish there had been a little more development of his character and more depth to his back story. My only small criticism of the film was the overly complicated \\"Love Quadrangle\\" which included a military connection that never quite connected. That small criticism aside, I fully imagine this film will be on my most watched list for years to come.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Great game once you get to level 8, the smaller squares are too easy. I recommend it for a quick mind bender.

1451627297|5.0|I always say that I judge a book by how many times I've read it.  I've read each of the Narnia books more than twenty times and am currently rereading the Potter series for the sixth or seventh time.  And I'm right in the middle of Stephen King's \\"The Stand\\" for probably the fifth time.<br /><br />I've only read \\"11/22/63\\" once so far but am starting to feel that call to read it again.  It's not a perfect novel but it is a perfect blend of a novel, a blend of sci-fi, horror and romance.  King, himself, was once a teacher and in many places \\"11/22/63\\" is an ode to teaching.  It's a love story, not just between the main character and the woman he falls in love with, but a love between a man and a time long past.  And it's also a thank you, I think, from King to his fans.  The allusions to his previous work in \\"It\\" made me giddy, as if I was meeting friends again who I hadn't seen since we were kids.<br /><br />As a writer, I want to put this book under my pillow at night and hope something about the craft of writing leaks through osmosis.  That's how near to perfect it is.

0670022950|5.0|Steven Pinker is a great thinker and writer. He is also (I can personally attest) a great human being. And he has produced a magisterial tour-de-force.<br /><br />The Better Angels Of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined is a big book on what might seem a narrow topic. But in Pinker's hands it turns out to be broad indeed. It's about how humans relate to each other - from individuals to nations - and how those relations have evolved. It's about moral progress.<br /><br />Pinker argues that such progress has been immense, concentrated in recent centuries, manifested in a \\"Humanitarian Revolution\\" and declines in violence of all kinds, including war. He recognizes this is a tough sell, with so much contrary conventional wisdom: \\"Man's inhumanity to Man,\\" and so forth. (One radio interviewer I heard was like, \\"Pinker, are you out of your mind?\\") That's partly why it's a big book. Pinker has to clobber the cynics (non-violently, of course) with an avalanche of facts.<br /><br />And he's not satisfied merely showing what has happened. He aims to explain why it happened (as the title promises). However, human life being so complex, such explanations are hard to tease out, and Pinker has to dig deeply in the effort. Following along with this, for the reader, is full of reward.<br /><br />I'll be candid that I agree with virtually everything Pinker says -- deliciously feeding my confirmation bias. A remarkable number of his points are also made in my own shorter book, The Case for Rational Optimism. (Pinker mentions it; he told me it's a \\"wonderful book.\\") It's an excellent alternative if you want just the capsule version.<br /><br />Pinker starts off with a plot summary of the Bible. This is a hoot. (His writing is sometimes literally laugh-out-loud funny.*) In contrast, the \\"Good Book\\" is pretty appalling (though the real good news, Pinker notes, is that most of it isn't true); but his purpose is not debunking. Rather, it's to show how drastically attitudes toward violence have changed - Biblical \\"civilization\\" was utterly barbaric by today's standards.<br /><br />One of Pinker's key points is that indictments of modernity rest on romanticizing the past and forgetting its horrors. And he unsparingly reminds us. The chapter on torture not only shows how ubiquitous it was, but provides clinical details. It's extremely unpleasant reading which tender souls may prefer to skip.  The pillory might seem a mild, even comical form of punishment. It wasn't. Victims were helplessly assaulted by onlookers; agony, maiming, and death were common. Other tortures were often far worse.<br /><br />And what was the bloodiest conflict in history? If you say WWII you'd be right in absolute numbers killed. But its death toll ranks only ninth as a percentage of population. On that measure, history's killingest episode was one you never heard of: China's 8th Century An Lushan rebellion. I am both a history buff and Chinese coin specialist, and even I was ignorant of this. It shows how deep historical amnesia runs.<br /><br />The World Wars were admittedly non-trivial. But all the peaceniks who prattle about our supposedly inveterate war lust are, as is often said of generals, \\"fighting the last war.\\" We're now at 67 years with zero wars among major powers.<br /><br />To explain this, Pinker invokes Kant's 1795 essay, \\"Perpetual Peace,\\" foreseeing a warless club of free-trading democracies. Kant, he says, got three out of three right: trade, democracy, and association among nations practicing those things, all combine to produce peace. Indeed, Pinker sees an even deeper Kantian cause, with all the foregoing reflecting operation of Kant's \\"categorical imperative\\" - guide your actions by principles that can be made universal. In other words, an instinctual human bedrock utilitarian morality. Thus major wars, Pinker says, seem to be going the way of such practices as slavery, heretic-burning, breaking on the wheel, flogging, etc., \\"that passed from unexceptionable to controversial to immoral to unthinkable to not-thought-about.\\"<br /><br />Of course violent conflict still happens; as in Syria. But the cause is almost always bad, undemocratic governments; and more of those are falling than arising. Germany and Japan were the prime examples; Serbia was another. One country at a time, the world grows up, and its juvenile delinquents turn into responsible adults.<br /><br />As noted, the book presents a mountain of factual material, and the scientifically proper way to assess such data is through statistical analysis. This Pinker does - or perhaps overdoes. The problem is that statistical analyses of such complex phenomena as war and violence entail a plethora of knotty methodological issues, which Pinker conscientiously adumbrates - filling many pages that are apt to leave a lay reader more confused than edified. While of course such analyses are integral to the book's argument, Pinker might have been bolder in cutting to the chase, recapping the big picture in the text and relegating the nitty-gritty to appendices. Similarly, he seems impelled to pursue every possible nuance of every point, sometimes leading afield of the main line of argument. (Any book review must include at least one knock. There's mine.)<br /><br />Pinker is no monomaniacal pedant. Notably, after cataloguing great reductions in varied forms of child abuse, he goes on to argue that we've over-corrected, falling into an overblown hysteria that actually harms children. Parents driving kids to school, in fear of abduction, subject them to a far greater risk from car accidents. Keeping them from playing outside contributes to obesity. Et cetera. Pinker seems particularly miffed that misguided overprotectionism has put paid to the game of dodgeball. A DVD of early Sesame Street episodes was labeled \\"not suitable for children.\\" And one school banned Halloween costumes in a host of categories - including those that are \\"scary\\"!<br /><br />Speaking of scary, terrorism has preoccupied America for a decade, feeding perceptions of a dangerous, violent world. Pinker is admirably cogent on why that's so cockeyed. In the big scheme of things, terrorism is simply trivial (vis-&agrave;-vis, for example, the 30,000+ yearly U.S. highway deaths, which I keep mentioning, and which we accept with blas&eacute; equanimity). Indeed, as Pinker explains, more Americans may have died due to our panic over terrorism than from terrorism itself. He does acknowledge the special danger of nuclear terrorism; but after carefully dissecting all the logistical hurdles, deems it highly improbable. Meantime, terrorism is not on the upswing in recent times, and is actually burning itself out mainly for the simple reason that it rarely works. (With every terrorist atrocity, I ask myself, what is the f---ing point? What do these people expect to accomplish?) That means our strategy toward terrorism is exactly wrong. Getting our knickers in a twist over it makes it seem like it is working. Far better to shrug it off, sending the message: do your worst, it won't affect us.<br /><br />So - why has violence declined, virtually across the board? Pinker provides a whole synergistic web of reasons, a virtuous circle in which diverse trends feed each other. At its heart is that people are actually becoming smarter and thinking better. This poke in the eye of conventional wisdom is (like everything in the book) backed up with plenty of evidence and analysis. Pinker also addresses just how and why cognitive advancement leads to greater peaceableness. One aspect is technological progress (accelerated by the growing brainpower) which has made ideas and people increasingly mobile, producing the global village and what Pinker calls the \\"Republic of Letters.\\" Civilization is civilizing us. And smarter people are more likely to be liberal - meaning not so much left-liberalism as classical liberalism (my kind), whose chief value is maximizing the autonomy of individualsto pursue their own flourishing, with its corollaries of limited government and free trade. That such a worldview would promote peaceableness over violence seems obvious.<br /><br />So Pinker does not join with those intellectuals and scientists among whom it is lately fashionable to deride the whole idea of human reason. He thinks we have brains, and use them -- increasingly.<br /><br />This book will make its readers even smarter still; and thus its author isn't merely heralding a better world, he's helping it along.<br /><br />Discussing vegetarianism, he queries whether a moose-eating bear oughtn't, morally speaking, be \\"tempted away with all-soy meatless moose patties.\\"errorism has preoccupied America for a decade, feeding perceptions of a dangerous, violent world.

B0010SKUYM|5.0|For somebody like me, who really loves reading, and enjoys spectating so much... it's actually surprising I'm writing a review. In fact, it's not a review I want to write, it's a huge thank you note to the author because this is possibly the best piece of modern day fantasy I have ever read.<br /><br />It's a true testemant to the quality and depth of the stories and characters that months and months (years?) after reading it I still can't stop thinking about it. Randomly, sometimes, a scene from the novel pops into my head. The characters are so true, yet so mystical at the same time... and I know that I could never be friends with someone like the protagonist, yet I love and admire him. And if I lived in that world where such a character existed, I know I would stay far, far, away. Out of fear, for myself.<br /><br />No words can do this novel justice. Truly. And because I know that, I am not even going to try to tell readers why they should read this book. They just must.<br /><br />To the author Mr. Patrick Rothfuss, this post is dedicated to you. You deserve to know that you have woven something amazing... so intricate, so beautiful... and OH MY GOD WHEN WILL YOU RELEASE BOOK 3 ALREADY?! =)<br /><br />Cheers to you, Mr. Patrick Rothfuss, for somehow bringing together simplicity and depth. It's like Apple products. So simple, and so easy, but so complicated to create at the same time. I really admire what you've done. Thank you =) You really have a gift.

They \\"don't offer support for that at this time\\".
0307346617|3.0|I will start off by saying that this is the first Zombie book that I have read. I'm a big fan of sci-fy in general...movies or books. So I was very excited to read this. I started it over a month ago, and just finished. Usually, books don't last me a week. I found this book to be, as a whole,  boring. I say that because there were a few stories that actually grabbed me and didn't allow me to put down the book. My favorite story being of the Japenese kid who spent all of his time connected to the internet and didn't notice when his parents went missing.<br /><br />Now, I have to say that the biggest thing that bothered me about this book was the fact that all of the characters that were interviewed sounded exactly the same. Maybe one or two interviews sounded different, but I just kept thinking that this interview could be written/spoken by the person before it. There was just no real difference in voice. I find this to be a problem in a book that is written in a style that contains only interviews of many different people.<br /><br />I did enjoy a few parts of this book, and it was really well-thought out with how all of the different countries reacted to the outbreaks and whatnot. I just really expected it to be more interesting. I don't even remember being spooked at all.<br /><br />Oh and one of my biggest complaints - they never mentioned how this all started. Just that it was some virus. Well - what happened to the virus? Where did it go? Now that most of the zombies are dead, how come it isn't coming back? Maybe this is just because I'm a zombie novice, but that seemed like one of the most interesting things to me and it was missing. I kept hoping it would pop up at the end of the book, but it never did.<br /><br />To sum it all up, I would just say to potential readers - it gets really repetitive and narratives don't differ much in voice, which ruins the novelty of the book.
0345803485|1.0|With a rush of blood to my head when bits of the first of the trilogy were read to me on the phone, I bought them all from Amazon.com<br />I've struggled through the first fifty pages of the first book, and found the whole thing boring and repetitive, and a VERY dull read.<br />I flicked through the other two books and found they were just the same.  I'll send them for Christmas to someone I don't much like!<br />I gave the book one star, but only because I couldn't find a way to give it NO stars!

0385342063|4.0|Really enjoyed this one! I haven't read anything from Sophie Kinsella yet, but I do know that she has plenty of books out there, including the Shopaholic series. I'm not really super psyched about starting yet another series, but after reading I've Got Your Number, I'm definitely going to be reading a few of her other books. Remember Me & The Undomestic Goddess sound like good ones that I added to my TBR list so far.<br /><br />Although this might have been a little predictable in just a few parts, it was a great story about Poppy and the events and people she meets leading up to her wedding. The book starts with Poppy having just lost her engagement ring (priceless heirloom that's been in the family for awhile) & then her mobile gets stolen. She's feeling pretty desperate at this point after having given everyone at the hotel (where she had a bachelorette party) her phone number to contact in case they find the ring. She finds a mobile in a trash bin and it works. She gives this new number to the hotel staff & lets all her friends know as well. She's planning on keeping the phone until maybe someone finds the ring.<br /><br />She soon meets Sam, the boss of the person (his personal assistant) who previously owned the phone and had since quit. She first learns of him through his work emails and texts. Sam lets her continue using the phone though until she finds her ring, after hearing about her situation. Then come some pre-wedding disasters and some unfortunate events with Sam's company. Poppy & Sam both have their flaws, which make them more relatable I think, but I loved them. The story had a couple of great less-than-desirable characters as well too. I found myself alongside Poppy being extremely irritated with a few of them. Great chemistry, mystery, and drama in this one!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved this book, great thriller, kept me guessing the whole way through.  Highly recommend!! I already passed to my sister and she agrees!

CD is in great condition for being a used item, works great, I like all the songs on the CD but my personal favorites would have to be \\"Riot\\" \\"Get Out Alive\\" and \\"Animal I have Become.\\"

B000ZNRBK4|4.0|Nice quality and fits perfectly to my Nikon 18-55mm af-s 3.5/5.6g lens. Once attached it sits well, and easy to take it off when you don't need it. I do think over $10 is way too much for a piece of plastic ring, but you get what you pay for quality-wise.

B0067TGSOK|5.0|Chris Guillebeau's \\"The $100 Startup: Reinvent the Way You Make a Living, Do What You Love, and Create a New Future\\" is the kind of book I was actually a little hesitant to review, out of a selfish desire to keep such excellent information to myself. Nonetheless, here I am.    The $100 Startup is a book about entrepreneurship, but it's about more than that. It is a profile of successful startup businesses, that have been significantly successful for their owners, with a minimum initial investment. The manifesto in the prologue calls it \\"a short guide to everything you want,\\" and really, that's what this book is about. It is a blueprint to start you on the path to doing better work.    If you take one key idea away from this book, it should probably be the magic formula. Passion or skill + usefulness = success. In other words, if you can use your passion or skills to solve a problem that other people have, you will be successful. The book then delves into a bunch of great examples of startups, some of the challenges they faced, and some additional lessons to consider on your path.    Everyone had skills and passions. How can you turn those into a successful business and earn enough money to have the life you want? That's for you to decide, but I finished this book with an idea about how to transform my own passions into a business. I was starting to do that before I read the $100 Startup, but this crystallized my desire to pursue the lifestyle I want by utilizing my passions, and started me thinking about what needs I could fulfil and benefits I could provide. If you read this book, you will probably feel the same way.    Guillebeau's book is packed with a lot of useful information. Better yet, it has a companion website, [...], which features some of the resources in the book in a handy pdf format.    Do you need this book to start your own business and because an entrepreneur? Of course not. Are you a lot more likely to become one if you read this book? Probably. Are you more likely to succeed if you read this  book? Probably. This is about more than just having an idea. This book takes you from the initial step of the idea, to how to research and build your product or service, how to market it, and how to build your  business.    I am sitting down to read this book again, which is what prompted this review. I expect I will come away having learned more after the second read. How is my startup business coming? Slowly. I want to build a superior service, and that takes time. That's okay. This book changed how I think about my future, and what my plans were. It was without a doubt the most important thing I've read in a long time.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Graphics are amazingly crisp.. Simple enough for a 5 year old with the ability to challenge even the most adept puzzler!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I, like apparently most other people that read the book, did so because of hearing all the hype about it. I was very disappointed in the grammar and format of the writing. Several times I was on the brink of quitting reading it if I read &#34;holy cow&#34; or holy other obscenities , or if I read her referring to her vagina as &#34;down there&#34; one more time. Gasp! Biting lip. Intense gray eyes....it was like reading &#34;icy touch&#34; over and over in &#34;Twilight&#34;. Horrible story line, if the girl was not with the guy for his money then why was she mad for him? he was a control freak stalker with zero personality outside of the bedroom. Had much greater expectations!

B004LWZW8I|3.0|A fabulous art project, who was their art director, Rembrandt?  The use of chiaroscuro is breathtaking.  However, a movie cannot stand on art alone; it's a medium that requires a story.  (I do wish filmmakers would stop pouring all their funds into the look of a movie, leaving a nickel leftover for the screenplay.)  The story is simple and to the point: a bad guy wants a magical bow, said bow in easily found and just as quickly lost to the bad guy who uses the aforementioned bow to release a cage full of crazy little Titans.  A brawl ensues, the end.<br />Okay, a few other hardly worth mentioning things happen in between, but you get the picture (literally).  The story was as bare bones as it gets.  There was no depth, no delving into any aspect of the story, none of the relationships were examined; everything was treated as a set piece.  This was a magical place populated by stick figures made to order.  Few of the actors stood out, which can easily be blamed on the lack of light.  While it is commendable that the filmmakers stayed true to the light sources of the day (candles, oil lamps, and campfires), this method did not make for easy viewing.  Of the cast, only Mickey Rourke left a lasting impression, everyone else's work was cursory at best, and as such easily forgettable.  The problem with this movie is that it lacks heart and soul.  It's grim and gruesome and reeks of indifference.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I have to say that I did get bored with this book when I got to 50% of it.  I had to make myself read the rest of it.  I wasn't planning on buying the second book until I got to the end of it.  The end leaves you in suspense where you have to buy the second book.  The second book is much better.  I am at the begining of the 3rd book.

B003G4W49C|4.0|I recently bought a Asus TF300 tablet, and had Kindle and Nook for it, and since I love just about any SciFi, I googled the top SciFi novels of all time, and this book came up consistently near the top, and in my opinion, it belongs there.<br /><br />I did not have any of the electronic problems with Kindle that others seemed to have.<br /><br />I DID read a number of the negative reviews, and in a nutshell, a good portion seemed to criticize the book because of the premise, and how far fetched it was. Hello! It's SciFi. SciFi generally requires suspension of reality, and the readers should be able to get that.  Even the best Star Trek, Babylon 5, Star Wars, Batman or Spider Man movie or episode is completely far fetched and requires that we suspend reality. \\"Beam me up\\" simply isn't possible either, yet we just assume it exists. We always go along with it, and we don't ask for the technical manual and physics of how it works. The awesome movie \\"Inception\\" starts out with a premise that one can get into another's dreams. The story doesn't even TRY to tell us how that came to be. It just is. The story goes forward as if EVERYONE knows it is. In this book, so what if kids are drafted into the I.F.. It just is. Accept it. Move on.<br /><br />The only thing I though was weak was the way the book continued for about 20 pages or so after the Bugger War was over. It seemed way too rushed, and followed the characters a little TOO far into the future. Perhaps the author wasn't considering the next book too seriously at the time, but the last several pages could have been added to the next one, and expanded better, and just left \\"the rest of their lives\\" to the reader's imagination for the time being. Hence only 4 stars.

0553801473|2.0|I just finished DoD and I truly feel like it was a waste of time. I loved the first 3 books, thankfully I read the reviews about a Feast of Crows and wasn't too disappointed  by the fact that a lot of the characters I had invested in were no where in the book. I also read the reviews for this book, and bought it, and skimmed, skimmed, skimmed - oh read about Theon, skimmed, skimmed, read a bit about Arya, skimmed over all the useless filler, no forward moving dialogue- ugh just boring! What happened? How could the first 3 books be SO GOOD, and the last 2 so poor?
B007L3BMGA|1.0|The most amateur , poorly written book I have ever read, and I read a lot.<br />Repeatitive phrases,(wont go into that as other reviewers have done it), ridiculous far fetched storyline, and the sex scenes became so boring and unrealistic I couldnt stop yawning while reading them.<br />Only bothered to finish it because I had paid $9.00 for it, wouldnt read the rest of them if someone offered to pay me.<br />Only gave it one star because there was no 'minus star' option.<br />If you consider yourself reasonably intelligent, dont insult your brain with this rubbish,if you have nothing to read at all, read the back of cereal packets, its more interesting than this garbage.

0425263908|2.0|Not at all worth the read. After reading Fifty Shades of Gray (the series) this book has taken all the originality from Fifty Shades and tried to mirror it, poorly. I would not even consider reading the next book.<br /><br />This author should find something original rather than piggy back on someone elses creativity. I am glad to see she at least acknowledged E.L. James the author of Firty Shades, noting that Fifty Shades captivated readers to read more of E. L James.
B000002KHH|5.0|I know no one will probably read this with all of the other great reviews on here. But as one person from the South, I am amazed at how many people have never heard Paranoid, or even Black Sabbath. My friends, as you all well know, this is the classic album that put them on the map. We start with \\"War Pigs\\" for 1970...this is some pretty heavy stuff. Using dark imagery to spread their message of greedy politicians, war games, loss of lives, the popultaion being manipulated, the guys use this to accomplish their goal of making one of the best metal tracks in history. So after here...what does the band do? MAKE ANOTHER CLASSIC TRACK!! \\"Paranoid\\" one of the finest metal songs recorded. The bass is pounding and Ozzy is on his game. The riffs...ha classic. Bill Ward's drumming is intense as ever (1970 remember) \\"Planet Caravan\\" I find it a little odd, but it is still a classic. \\"Iron Man\\" Catchy riff lovers rejoice!! You probably already know this song. If you don't, just buy this. \\"Electric Funeral\\" Could this be early doom? Ozzy has a strange vocal showing but it is unique and fits the track perfectly. \\"Hand Of Doom\\" One of the most underrated Sabbath songs. A total classic. \\"Rat Salad\\" One of the most intense songs in its day and time. Bill Ward's drumming is crazy!! \\"Faries Wear Boots\\" strange title...but the main riff will have you forget about that title. It has a great groove to it and concludes this fantastic album. If you want a metal collection, this is golden one that starts it all.<br /><br />I also recomend, \\"Black Sabbath\\" Judas Priest \\"Sad Wings Of Destiny\\" and \\"Stained Class\\" and Motorhead's \\"Motorhead\\" this should help you get a fill for the more popular bands that helped form the greatest genre of music ever, METAL!!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I Ordered this, and it's a great set, but while I was watching one of the movies, it had bad skips for couple of minutes. I tried checking the disc. No scratches, it was just poorly written onto the disc. I exchanged it for another one, and the second time was the charm. No problems on the exchange. Quick and easy, and the set is awesome. Great production value, fit and finish. I chose to rate the good set I got, rather than deduct stars for the failed first attempt.
B007XNAQL0|5.0|I will echo the other reviews in saying that this DVD is great, and a wonderful addition to my library.  Peter Gabriel was on fire on this tour, and his passion shows, and is captured well here.  I never saw the prior version of this DVD, so I can't comment on specific quality comparisons, although I agree with the other reviewer that said it can appear a bit grainy at times.  But, that doesn't take away from the feeling you get watching it.  I attended this concert in 1993 (although in the concert I attended, Sinead O'Connor replaced Paula Cole), and it was a \\"make-up\\" show for a concert Peter had previously cancelled due to illness.  He was so apologetic about that during the show, and promised to give us a great night, and he and his band did just that!  Wonderful memory that will stay with me always.

B00846TTDG|5.0|I rented this movie the same day I rented Safe House. I couldn't watch it on a trip I was taking, because even though I had downloaded it before I left my house, on the plane I got the message \\"can not view without wifi\\". Unfortunately I was on a plane so I couldn't watch it until I got back home. In any event I was able to watch this movie and would recommend this to anyone who likes action movies, as much as I do, and also because it gives great insight to what the Navy Seals deal with on their missions. So if you enjoy action movies or true story regarding the Military, RENT THIS MOVIE you will not be disappointed!
030758836X|4.0|description:On a warm summer morning in North Carthage, Missouri, it is Nick and Amy Dunne's fifth wedding anniversary. Presents are being wrapped and reservations are being made when Nick's clever and beautiful wife disappears from their rented McMansion on the Mississippi River. Husband-of-the-Year Nick isn't doing himself any favors with cringe-worthy daydreams about the slope and shape of his wife's head, but passages from Amy's diary reveal the alpha-girl perfectionist could have put anyone dangerously on edge. Under mounting pressure from the police and the media--as well as Amy's fiercely doting parents--the town golden boy parades an endless series of lies, deceits, and inappropriate behavior. Nick is oddly evasive, and he's definitely bitter--but is he really a killer?<br />  As the cops close in, every couple in town is soon wondering how well they know the one that they love. With his twin sister, Margo, at his side, Nick stands by his innocence. Trouble is, if Nick didn't do it, where is that beautiful wife? And what was in that silvery gift box hidden in the back of her bedroom closet?<br /><br />But wow the book turns and twists and you cant put this book down.  You think Nick did it then she opens you up to the psyche of Amazing Amy as they call her....The best friend says he did it but others that knew Amy when in high school says she way out there and she can make you think you've lost your mind.  The book takes you through all the questioning of Nick and his bad habbits are not helping him look innocent.  He was basically ready to divorce Amy anyway or kill her himself before she went missing anyway but now he sure doesnt want to go to jail for something he didnt do or did he do it?  I also really like his sister Margo or Go they called her she was behind him most of the time and even she had doubts maybe he did do it.<br /><br />Get the book you will love it! I gave it 4.5 stars.

B007K3JFUQ|3.0|This is not bad for a sequel - lots of action, but you saw most all of the action in all of the previews to the movie.  They try and take off right were the first one ended, but this ones seems to have been rushed when they were righting it.  I know the challenge is to be as original as the first when making a sequel but in this case I think the bar was set too high.<br /><br />The first one was very memorable.  This was more like a light snack that you will forget about shortly after digesting.
B0088TG252|1.0|I rented this film in June, but didn't try to watch it until early July. I was on a plane heading to Michigan, and it wouldn't allow me to watch it without a wifi connection. This didn't make any sense to me since I had already downloaded the movie. Anyway I got home a week later and decided to watch it. I got about 1/4 of the way through and the movie stopped. No reason I could think of but it just stopped. I didn't contact Amazon due to the fact that I had rented it in June and didn't watch it until July. I just figured they would have assumed I had watched it and was now wanting something they felt I didn't deserve. If I am mistaken about how Amazon would have responded, I apologize. But I hope you understand why I felt the way I did. What little of the movie I saw was really good, but could only give it one star because I couldn't watch the rest of it.
B006G7Y7GY|4.0|I laughed out loud many times while reading this book. There is a lot of detail about Ozzy's early life and Black Sabbath.  I would definitely recommend this book to any one who's even a passing fan of Ozzy's.  There are many hilarious stories of Ozzy's adventures. He also gets very personal about the relationships that he cared about most in his life.<br /><br />While I read the book in 3 days, It does bog down a lot in the last 3rd of the book. The drug and alcohol stories just get tiring and uninteresting after a while. Also, being an enormous Randy Rhoads fan I was disappointed that there is very little about him in this book. Zack and Jake also get very little mention. I could care less about the MTV show.<br /><br />However, just buy the book, it's a lot of fun!
B0063IH60K|4.0|although the ads do tend to be a bit annoying, over all its a good free app. does exactly what you expect which is a nice change of pace
B002T9H2L0|5.0|The opening scene is truly amazing.  This is wear Tarantino shows his amazing skill as a director.  2 guys sit in a house having a conversation.  No action, no guns, just talking.  Tarantino takes this scene and slowly builds you up with tension.  You know something is going on but you do not know what.  It then comes to an end with a bloody climax.<br /><br />Credit to Brad Pitt for stepping outside his comfort zone and creating a truly unique and memorable character.  This one of those films that if I stumble across while channel surfing I will stop and watch the rest of it, regardless of which scene is playing.

B005HSL626|4.0|Love this so much,  but it crashed my kindle fire and couldn't fix it. I left it on until the battery ran out to let it shut down. The screen just went black and played the theme music. I love it and its free, therefore I'm okay with it as long as it doesn't happen again.
B0087DFIOU|4.0|I have been a fan of Mel for a long time and was waiting for some new stuff. I had not seen anything about this one until I saw it as a rental/  After further investigating I know why.  This was never released in the US on big screen, only overseas. It makes a good rental when you need your fill of Mel and action.<br /><br />The character he plays is pretty much an older version of the character he played in Payback (one of my favorite Gibson movies).  He is cooler, smarter and luckier than anyone else around him which makes you ask yourself - if he was this cool and smart how does he get himself into these predicaments in the first place.  The movie opens with Mel and his partner in clown costumes.  As you get to know the character you realize this is totally out of character.  He does very ingenious things in the rest of the movie so you know they added the clown suits just to try and add some humor.<br /><br />The movie and character are so close to Payback the final lines in the move are almost identical.<br /><br />But for a Friday night rental, not bad.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great game though some of the games included are a bit hard to play. fun to play. I like that you can unlock new games, makes it more of a challenge.
B002G1YPH0|1.0|My non-overclocked 2500k gets up to 65c on 30 mins of prime 95 blend test; idles from 38-50c (while web browsing) with an ambient temp of 24 c. Overclocking it to 4.2 gHz (Auto OC), my cpu goes up to 85c in a minute using  the prime 95 blend test. I've tried reseating the cooler, remounting the bracket, and applying different thermal pastes and methods, no luck. I've tightened the screws and the cooler is still easy to twist; there seems to be not enough clamping force so my cooler might not be directly touching the cpu.<br />My overclocked e8500 at 4 gHz only gets up to 61c on the same test and in the same case using an OCZ Vendetta 2 cooler.
1400052181|4.0|I like the all specific details that author described about the Lack's family and science.<br />It's a little hard for a college student. Amazing story.!
0375869026|5.0|I finished this book, not five minutes ago. I read it in a day and I am beyond eager for September to start so I can encourage my middle schoolers to read this book. It's a page turner written with 20th century lingo, but done in a natural way. Sometimes authors try to hard to make their book seem updated and modern, but this happens naturally for R.J. Palacio. And yet, it's a timeless book that will remain in my middle school language arts and reading classroom until I retire. And maybe longer. Bravo!
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|I received Jamie McGuire's Beautiful Disaster through the recent \\"Feed Your Reader\\" promotion on NetGalley, and read it because I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. There were several reviews on Goodreads that suggested the male character in the book was an Edward Cullen (Twilight)-type obsessive lover, but I wanted to reserve judgment since it was such a popular read.<br /><br />Having read through the book in one sitting, I'm disgusted with myself for reading it.<br /><br />Abby Abernathy is a college freshman. She meets bad boy (naturally) Travis Maddox at an underground fight, and while many of the girls on campus are falling all over him, she refuses to. They end up spending time together because Abby's best friend is dating Travis' cousin/roommate, and you can probably guess how it ends up.<br /><br />Mind you, Travis and Abby end up together only to break up about 800 times over the course of the book. And only after much angst and gnashing of teeth and everyone being a mess over it and another really great guy dating her for a week and giving her a diamond bracelet. You may be thinking \\"Mary Sue\\" but you have seen nothing yet: this is a Mary Sue who belongs in a psych ward.<br /><br />Yes, Travis has anger management problems, is obsessed with Abby, and does insane things like trash his room after they have sex and she goes home. But would you like to know why he does these things? Because Abby has an arsenal of head games at her disposal that would put Parker Brothers to shame. Oh, Travis might be in love with me? I think I'll go out on a date. Oh, I want to break things off with Travis? I think I'll sleep with him and then sneak out to do so.<br /><br />What the ever-loving hell?<br /><br />Beautiful disaster? These two are a case study waiting to happen. Or a murder-suicide, in all likelihood.<br /><br />This has at times been billed as Young Adult or New Adult but the idea that anyone of an impressionable age should read this and think it's any way to have any kind of a relationship frightens the pants off me. Never mind that the idea that Travis could not only beat up one, but TWO students in a school cafeteria and no one ever calls security is beyond belief.<br /><br />I won't even get into the far-fetched tiny subplot about Abby's father that sets off another breakup I'm near speechless that people love reading about these characters. Each time I turned a page I hoped someone was going to get into therapy, straighten their life out, something. By the end I honestly hoped that both characters would turn to drugs and overdose or something, because that was the only happy ending I could foresee for this couple.<br /><br />The last time I came across a love story this horrifying was Mickey and Mallory in Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers, but that was a satire. I have no idea what one would call this.<br /><br />The worst part of the whole book for me was that you could tell McGuire obviously has talent at creating emotional resonance in her scenes. There were moments that you wanted to like the characters and have them fall in love, but then they were right back to the horror show. That she used that talent with two such unredeemable characters was tragic.<br /><br />This review appeared previously on NetGalley.ay to have any kind of a relationship frightens the pants off me.

1609611543|2.0|I started off really liking this book.  It actually had me quite excited.  Chapter after chapter clearly showing how wheat and ONLY wheat was to blame for various health problems.  It was a little exhaustive, but I was willing to stick it out.  Then the chapters come that discuss how to eliminate wheat from your diet.  The only problem?  That's when the author tells you that you have to eliminate A LOT MORE that just wheat from your diet.  It ends up being very disappointing and coming off as just a re-branding of the low-carb craze from years ago.  Either the author's advice contradicts his own theory or he is being deliberately deceptive.  I was anxious for something fresh, new, and revolutionary and I was let down.
B007BZM3HK|5.0|I like this song a lot. It just hits home and it is clean so I don't mind if my kids listen to the lyrics. It's got a nice catchy beat and is danceable.<br /><br />We bought it and it's frequently requested by the kids.<br /><br />Love it.
B005ELZKWS|5.0|If you like 1) Sammy Haggar, 2) Joe Satriani, 3) Van Halen (or most any other 80's rock/hard rock band), you will like this sophomore effort by Chickenfoot (as well as their first one) ... these are rock legends just having fun making music the way THEY LIKE to MAKE rock music, and so, the way I LIKE to HEAR rock music. Each musician is great at what he does, and they come together as a group to record an equally great record. OK, no track-by-track commentary, etc: just go buy this and play the heck out of it LOUD!

B001TKFJVU|4.0|A story about a woman spending her vacation in a recreation of Austen's England? Sign me up! If you have even the slightest interest in Austen's work, you've probably wondered what it would be like to actually BE in her world. Hale takes this concept and writes a fun, lighthearted story about a woman who goes off to do exactly that, hoping to rid herself of her obsession with everything Austen once and for all. Humor, romance, and enough realism and sass to prevent it from getting too sappy, I gladly went along for the ride. I definitely recommend this one!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|i played this game years ago.  It is a fun and challenging game.  my kids and I love it.  You should try it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Its a AWESOME app! I love the reading plans! there are many to choose from and it's very easy to use. I like that you can set reminders and it reminds you to read your reading plan each day and it tracks your progress!  This Bible app has helped me understand parts of the Bible that were hard for me in the King James version, but now I can understand better with certain verses with a little research and looking at different translations of the same verse. What I also love another thing about this app is that I can switch from the different translations to get a better understanding of the word of God!

B003Z0BSU8|4.0|Among the available versions of the last two piano concertos (nos. 3 & 4)  by Sergei Rachmaninov, this one signed by Norwegian pianist Leif Ove Andsnes stands as an utterly valuable one, with some particular features that singles it out and makes it quite appealing. The technical approach of the soloist is impeccable, though somehow unusual. It seems to me not flamboyance-oriented, quite contrary. The proceedings are dominated by a reflective light, in contrast to other versions where the passion and the large scale developments govern. In musical terms, this approach could make much sense, if the preconceptions are abandoned. The pianist is paired by a top notch conductor (Antonio Pappano) and a super class orchestra (London Symphony), so the match between piano and the rich symphonic content of these concertos is marvelously realized.<br /><br />Maybe, some could prefer more ardent versions of these works (especially of the Third) such as those accomplished by Boris Berezovsky, Nikolai Lugansky or Denis Matsuev to name only a few recent releases by three truly stars of the Russian keyboard. However, Andsnes's version competes in its own right a place among the high level Rachmaninov recordings of the recent years.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|As it has been on the best seller list for some considerable time, curiousity compelled me to download this book and what a disappointment it was.  Full of gratuitious and endless sex, I managed to struggle through about half the book in the hope it would get getter - sadly it did not I had to give it up.  Aside from the fact that an older man with a penchant for kinky sex and a desire to corrupt and inflict his ways on an intelligent and inexperienced young woman, there was no plot to speak of and unless you can call continual sexual encounters of various kinds a plot - give this a big miss.  I'm a warm blooded woman who enjoys a normal and active sex life and this book left me cold.

0143038419|4.0|First of all it was better than I expected. For the past several years, movies that stared very famous people haven't done as well as were expected. Maybe money wise they were a good investment considering the fact that people go to many movies, not because they like the story line, but because they like the actor [actress] and assume that this famous person would not involve him or her self with a bad project. {Several months ago I heard about a story about a famous actress playing in a movie and on the opening weekend only one ticket was sold for it= not good}.    The movie, itself, is technically divided into four parts, even though only three are named. It's based on a book by Elizabeth Gilbert [...]    First part takes place in NY.    Marriage: Julia Roberts plays LIZ. Liz is a travel writer, married but is not happy in her current life. She is sort of like many people nowadays, they trudge through life not knowing what they want but knowing what they got now is NOT it. One night after a friend paraded her around to all the influential people at he party, like a prized chicken, she wakes up during the night and goes to pray for the first time. She even admits that praying is a foreign concept for her. She asks for a sign and what she gets is a decision that the life she has now is not making her happy. She is sort of living mechanically, not caring, not feeling.    She goes back to bed and tells her husband that she does not want to be married. Keep in mind that he is one of those \\"always finding myself\\" people. He jumps from one passion into another, into another. Later on he even admits that he though she was okay with his way of life. Which brings us to cliché lesson on relationships= COMMUNICATE. Anyone you ask would tell you that if the partners do not communicate with each other, don't tell each other what they like or dislike- the relationship is DUMMED. That's what happened to Liz's marriage. They just coexisted; roommates who occasionally had sex; twoships that followed the same route on parallel lines.    Cougar time:    She moves out of the house she shared with the husband and after a while has an affair with a younger man. That man is played by James Franco. Many women think that after a bad divorce that best thing they can do is have an affair with a younger man and all their troubles will be over. WRONG. This relationship will give the women some needed confidence boost, for a little while, but when the high wears off, and it will wear off, they will realize that whatever they felt was broken on the inside, hasn't been fixed. A few months later she realizes that she is still broken and to fix it she decided to go away for a year. She will visit Italy, India, and Bali.    The storage scene: While she is storing away her belongings a man was helping her load the items. As she looks at the full unit she says something along the lines that she did not expect that her whole life could just fit into one storage unit. The man answers that he hears that phrase many times a day and most of those people never come back, never come back to/for their old life. It was such a small scene but to me it seemed very important.    Italy; Let no carb go uneaten.    I really liked this part. She seemed to rejoice there. She meets great friends and as her website states she is still great friends with every one of those people. A very important American issue gets tackled in this part of her journey. Just like many women, after a break up, she spends a lot of time eating. While in a relationship or trying to get into one, women worry about their appearance. We have this idea that, just like in amusement parks `you have to be this tall to ride', in relationships `you have to be this small to participate'. There is this idiotic idea that if we are not supermodel sizes then we do not get to participate.    A. Food makes us feel good. B. we finally get to eat what we have craved for so long but were too afraid to eat, fearful thatit would show on our bodies. C. We are so burned out on the previous relationship that we do not care if we ever get to be in a relationship again. Anyway: Liz and Sofie [a Swedish woman she meets in Rome] are in a genuine Italian pizzeria and Sofie if afraid to eat it because she has already gained ten pounds. Liz asks her if she has been with a man since gaining this weight and if he ran away or asked her to leave when he saw Sofie's body. The answer is no. Liz goes on to say something along the lines of this guy's got a naked woman in his room, he's lucky, like winning the lottery, those ten pounds that you are obsessing about are the last thing a normal person would be thinking about.    India:    The actor Liz dated in her `cougar period' was a yogi and prayed by a picture of a guru. After Italy she travels to the Ashram of that guru hoping to study under her. Too bad - the guru has traveled to her NY ashram at that time. Liz is disappointed but decides to stay. She meets an American man [from Texas] there who is trying to forgive himself for almost killing his son [he was a drunk and almost ran over his own child]. Personally I did not like him. He did not seem like a nice person. The more I think about him and his influence on Liz, I realize that he really did a good thing for her, in his own way. He's like that mean old teacher that forces you to do a LOT of homework, etc. and you feel like you could hate this teacher. By the end of the year you realize that all that work was worth it and realize that when that teacher told you `you'll thank me later' the teacher was right. Richard [the man from Texas] forced Liz to confront herself and her actions and start to forgive herself for allowing herself to live the life she has lived.    Bali:    Scenic wise this stretch of her journey seemed the most beautiful. When she finally gets back to Bali, Ketut does not recognize her. She still has the same face but the worry, the pressure that she was feeling the last time she was there has disappeared. Once he finally remembers he asks her to rewrite all his notes [all the recipes/writing of his family that go back a thousand years]- a labor of love. At the end of her stay she presents him with a bound book of those writings [she has made copies of the original documents] - it's a nice gesture.    Here she also meets a man who would later become her husband. Being with hi heals her heart a little more but she is still afraid of acknowledging that she has given him her heart. The divorce has made her afraid of being hurt again. He is a divorcee too but is less reluctant in taking a chance. He tells her he loves her but she runs away. Only after she speaks to Ketut for the last time does she realize that he is the one for her and goes back to him. In Gilbert's next memoir we find out that they finally get married, although it does not happen they way we might think.    Liz also meets a woman named Wayan the healer. She is a fellow divorcee who has been able to do the impossible. Women in Bali do not have the same rights that American women have. If she dares to divorce her husband she gets NOTHING, not even the children. Wayan sold everything she owned to hire a lawyer and was able to gain custody of her daughter. In an email to friends Liz tells them that if she was home she would be planning an expensive party and they all would be buying her expensive gifts but this year she wants something different. She tells her friends about Wayan and asks them to donate whatever they were going to spend for her birthday gift to build a home for Wayan and her daughter. By the end 18000$ are donated and Wayan is able to build the house.    By the end of the movie we see Liz' ex-husband with a woman and a baby and we are led to assumed that he has re-maried and started a family with that woman. The actor with whom she had the relationship prior to leaving for the year is successful as shown by the ovation he gets after some performance. Wayanis happy and building a house. While Liz and Felipe are together.    Gilberts says that she still keeps in touch with all of the people whom she met on her journey.    Gilbert's website states that the real Richard has died. My condolences go out to his family and friends.    EAT PRAY LOVE    In Italy she eats, in India she prays and in Bali she finds love.    Some questions:    When you watch the movie you will see at the very beginning her speaking to Ketut. This man reads her palm and says that she will have two relationships, one short and one long. In less than a year she will loose all her money, but get it back some time later. And the last thing he says is that she will come back to Bali, help Ketut with his English, while he teaches her everything he knows. So the question is- Did everything that she lived through happened because it was destined to happen or because she was told it will happen and on the subconscious level convinced herself to make them happen?    Although I don't usually do this [ I either watch the movie interpretation or read the book but almost never do both, so far that happened only once and I did not like the experience of comparing the two and not being able to reconcile them] This time I will make the exception and add the book to my future reading list. Will write about it here once I get to it.    \\"See you later, alligator\\" - Ketut's usual good bye.

0345803485|1.0|I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. I made it to chapter nine and couldn't take any more. It was either bail, or poke my eyes out. This is hands-down, one of the worst books I have ever read. A clue to its atrociousness, is the author's own admission to not being a good writer. She got that part right. This drivel is reminiscent of a hormone-driven teenager, describing all her nether-region tinglings and fantasies of non-existent billionaires, in their diary. Did an editor even see this story??? The overly-detailed dialogue goes on and on and on and on......repetitively, like water torture. The girl blushes 115,000 times, everyone wears Converse that are constantly being put on and taken off, there is unabashed smirking going on ad nauseam....it's awful....amateurishly-poor writing. Which I may have been able to overcome, had the story been great. Sadly, it's just as bad. Remember Harlequin Romances? This is it, only more expensive and less to the point and perhaps more blatantly sexual. I even read one of those parts, hoping for some stirrings of my own, but all I could muster was an eye-roll. Avoid, avoid, avoid!

0793542049|5.0|The Book is entirely developed around the fundamentals of a walking bass line and the CD included has a jazz style backing track for every lesson.  Well done.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|cool game love playing ice age village and its got some nice stuff like games the collections are nice good rewards
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I like the kind of apps. that you have to figure out things so this is a pretty good one! It does get kind of boring but its something to do :) hope that is helpful....and so far it hasn't given me any kind of trouble!
B0055B0MIO|5.0|The band wasn't trying to recreate Shogun. I mean, how could they? This in itself is a darn good album and is one of the best of that year in the metal genre. Highly recommend.
B000O9RFDW|5.0|I absolutely love this record, cover and music itself. If you love Yes and have more than one of there albums, and you don't have this one? BUY THIS! IT'S AWESOME!
B0086700CM|4.0|The premise is extremely simple, and yet I somehow find myself playing over and over again. Simple controls, decent graphics and sound. Bonus: Kept a group of children ages between 3 and 13 occupied for over 30 min at a time!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|love the game. love getting new puzzles added every so often. wish there were more! the spaces are pretty small on the larger puzzles but the puzzles are worth it. would like more hints on what to do on those lines of all 1s or 1s &amp; 2s.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I really like the app. easy to use. and it is quick. love the large buttons and the ability to see the work as you are using the app.
0060989157|5.0|I'd have to admit that regardless of whether you're a fan of their music or not, this book makes for an excellent read. It's almost like a memorandum of the blooming 1980's Los Angeles subculture that harkens back to something out of a Bret Easton Ellis novel only \\"The Dirt\\" actually works without the aimless drivel. Nikki Sixx & his cohorts infatuation with the hedonistic routine are ferociously direct in their escalation from a hungry local band to recognition as MTV darlings. Commencing grande tales of debauchery & fornication from arena concert after hour antics to glitzy mansion shindig's to the countless substance abuse outing's. It's all the incentives, high's, low's, depravity, & demons that come with fame & fortune brought to you by none other than one of hair metal's surviving leading bands. A truly great book.
030758836X|1.0|This book was boring and irritating to read, I'm shocked that the previous readers were not honest in their reviews.<br />I especially disliked the mini quizes as the female charectoe couldn't just say what she was up to...Huge Waste of Time and Money!
B005K17RU0|5.0|was on the kindle when I bought it and it is nice. I like it quite well.<br />-I think.the multilevel city view is cool
B000002H6Q|5.0|This album is a tour de force of classic 80s rock. This is Motley's Appetite For Destruction. Granted, it might not have aged quite as well as Appetite, but the meat and bones of the songs still stand the test of time. There are brilliant riffs, great solos and consistantly great songwriting throughout. The highlights? \\"Don't Go Away Mad (Just Go Away)\\" starts as a beautiful melancholic accoustic number, before launching into a rockier second half and is undoubtedly one of the best Motley songs ever. \\"S.O.S. (Same Ol Situation)\\" is an unashamedly fun and catchy rocker, with more hooks than a fishermans tackle kit. \\"Kickstart My Heart\\" and \\"Dr Feelgood\\" are the albums megahits, both great anthemic rock tracks with chunky riffs and plenty of attitude. The album closer \\"Time For Change\\" is a great piano-laden rock ballad, it's cheesy as hell, but a solid track nonetheless.<br /><br />The whole album is killer - there's not a weak track in sight. Definately one of the best rock albums of the 80s.
B002JVWR4A|5.0|I love BONES... I have since I first came across it while visiting the States for Christmas.  Now, I have to wait until it comes out on DVD for the next season... that's a really hard thing to do, by the way.  It hasn't lost its charm in 5 seasons - and yet the characters have been anything but static - they have developed and undeveloped and redeveloped and yet each facet makes me adore them more.<br /><br />On top of that, the actual crimes and mysteries they must solve are FASCINATING!!  No show puts all that together as well as BONES.<br /><br />And BOREANAZ rocks, but that is completely beside the point.
B007ZZKWHY|3.0|A nice little B-movie from Europe, a black comedy with political overtones thrown in for laughs, the special effects and soundtrack was nice, it move along pretty good and was not boring! too bad there is no appreciation for this type of cinema in the States, if you can find this gem ,do your self a favor and watch it lower your expectations and enjoy......
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The whole series is fabulous! Can't wait for the movie! I know a lot of people are talking about James' lack of writing skills, but I really don't care about all of the \\"oh my\\"s and \\"oh crap\\"s,,it's a wonderful love story,,,not to mention the SEX! lol Men have to get books with pictures,,,women are much more sophisticated!
0679809015|3.0|The book was cute, but smaller than I expected. It literally fits in the palm of your hand. My son liked it. Very colorful and sturdy for active toddlers.
B003O86FMW|5.0|In this book Peeta proposes to katniss (as a fake). Peeta and Katniss have to go back into the games. Peeta says katniss is pregnant to try to get them out of the games. They don't finishe the game. Gale and katniss are in love ( FOR REAL). District 12 has an uprising and is ruined. Most people are dead. Some people escaped to distric 13. Including:<br />Primrose everdeen<br />Katniss's mother<br />Katniss<br />Gale<br />...
B0085A9HXS|4.0|The best hand to hand combat flick in years, they raise the bar in terms what a action movie can or should be for fans of this genre,what a spectacular display of gun play and martial arts,the plot was simple,go do your job as a law enforcement officer regardless of what you may expect,but do your job!whole scenario of going into the hood and getting the bad guy has been taken to another level in this film,love the villains in this flick ,because they were not dumb or over the top as we seen in a lot of action movies, vicious,ruthless and aggressive fit the description of these guys,the good guy was the star of the show ,his use of hand and feet combat skills after he ran out of bullets was magnificent,floor to floor of sheer brutality ,there  are so many ways a person can be taken out and this film put it on blast!by the time we get to the second half of the movie,we get a plot twist and this set the stage for one of the best two on one martial arts battles put on camera, by the time that was over ,we have to get to the main villain of the piece,The director of this masterpiece of brutality did his job telling a simple story with many great staged battles and a decent finale which set the tone for a sequel,this is must have for action lovers...highly recommended.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I loved this book. Really can't say enough good things about it. The relationships are honest, the characters nicely fleshed out, the situations thoughtful and realistic. I cared about every single person in the book. It touched me personally in more ways than one. I can't wait to read the second book in the series, but I'm going to, because I want to prolong the pleasure of this author's work.<br /><br />Thank you, Colleen Hoover, for writing such a beautiful novel.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Hi, my name is Heather, and this series is another accomplishment of Rick Riordan, my favorite author!!!<br />So Jason wakes in a school bus holding hands with a cute girl he doesn't know. He only vaguely remembers his name and age. Nothing else. He becomes immediate friends with Piper, the cute girl, and Leo. He's going on a field trip to the Grand Canyon with a school of troubled kids. Jason finds out his coach, Coach Hedge, is a satyr. He fights a storm spirit, and his coach disappears.<br />Later, he and Piper and Leo are at Camp Half-Blood, a safe camp with mgical borders to protect it for half-bloods(demigods). They find out they are also demigods, and are part of a prophecy. They go on a quest, facing dangerous wolves, gods, and meeting Jason's sister, Thalia.<br />After the quest, the whole camp figures that Percy Jackson, a senior camper who's been missing, is at the Roman camp, Camp Jupiter. He is also part of the prophecy and all of the members of Camp Half-Blood will have to build a Greek ship to get to Camp Jupiter, join together, and get ready.<br /><br />Did you like that? If you did, I very much encourage you to read this series. The third book, the Mark of Athena, will come Fall, 20012!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is poorly written from a mechanics of fiction standpoint, and also misrepresents both BDSM and the people who practice it.  It is not worth reading for almost any reason and is in fact an adaption of a fanfiction.
B0053TMP24|4.0|A continuation of Percy Jackson's tale as a demi-god.  I will bet that you thought his story was ended with the strife against the titans.  But there is still more afoot, as Percy loses his memory and finds himself in a camp not friendly to Greeks.  How will he regain his memory and make his way in enemy territory?  If you liked the old series by Rick Riordan, this one will not disappoint.
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|I loved this, but just wanted to post a thought that may be helpful to other purchasers.  I watched Season 1 on Netflix and purchased Season 2 on Blu-ray, and I didn't think that there was that much to be gained from the higher resolution of the Blu-ray.  I wish I had gotten the regular DVD and saved a few bucks.  YMMV, of course.  But in any format, this is highly recommended.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Good gaming techniques and relaxing to play. Easily taught to a beginner yet challenging for more experienced players. A solid 8.5
B0064X7FVE|1.0|it doesn't work on the fire. I have to uninstall &amp; reinstall dailey because it doesn't update &amp; gets stuck in the previous day.
B0026OE2O8|2.0|THERE IS NOTHING AMAZING ABOUT THIS DVD RATHER THAN BORING SO CALLED EDUCATIONAL DOCUMENTARY!!!IMAGES ARE OK IF NOT SUCKS COMPARE TO PLANET EARTH OR LIFE OR HUMAN PLANET.....BE AWARE DON'T BUY IT...THIS IS COMPLETE GARBAGE
B005LAIGOQ|3.0|This movie was OK, not great.  The visuals were good, and the gothic feel was perfect for a ghost story......but it was slow and the ending was SO predictable that is was irritating.  I knew how this was going to end halfway through.  Daniel Radcliffe was good in this and has a great look about him for this type of story.  Just wish there had been more substance to the movie and more of a twist here and there.  There has been no good ghost story out there since The Others.  And we need one!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|it requires alot of concentration. And also I really liked so much I would like to try something new. Do you have any other games.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this app/game. It is both simple but challenging at the same time. One can spend a few mins or a whole lot more depending upon how much time one has. It is somehow incredibly addicting.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game.  I have pry it out of my nephew's hands to play as we both enjoy it.  I love that I can earn everything I need without having to buy a game card.
0307719219|4.0|I really enjoyed their framework for failed states that made a lot of sense to me.  The authors test many of the previous theories and show that are inadequate because you can have very opposite results in adjacent countries of the same culture at the same time - for example north versus south korea!<br /><br />essentially they argue for a 'goldi-locks = not too hot, not too cold, but just right' approach around centralised authority as the main reason for States to succeed or fail.<br />Too much authority corrupts and means the lucky few extract all the resources from everyone else which leaves most people little incentive to produce (eg. soviet russia, north korea).  Too little authority means that basic property rights to run businesses, communications for marketing and roads for routes to markets dont exist and people cant produce enough (eg. somalia, nepal)<br /><br />The book is quite long and the same ideas and examples sort of keep reappearing several times over.  sometimes I thought I must have picked up at the wrong chapter I had already read earlier and this suggests to me it could have been more succint.  A table showing all the various States that had failed and the root causes would have been a nice summary touch to help consolidate your new found knowledge from this worthwhile read.
1401937519|5.0|I'm an avid reader and sometimes, I get caught on self help type of books. I've read a bunch of them, I graduated from the SMI and I've practiced everything most gurus recommend. This book is different though. It validates so much and brings tons of peace to your soul. It is a must read if you like this type of reading.
B003L77GRO|4.0|Every season of Dexter is great but this season you really feel like you get to know him. I was cheering for him and crying with him the whole time. I love this show, it is addictive and entertaining.
B002E01LTI|5.0|Great Vampire story.  It is really well done and acted beautifully.  If you like the genre, you will not go wrong.  Blue ray makes a whole lot of difference.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I think 50 Shades of Grey is one of the best books I have ever read. It gives so much detail to what is happening and it gives the readers a piece of mind to think about when reading this novel. The sex seem's so intense, that nobody can stop the resist of putting the book down. I honestly think that this noevel is amazing. I would definitely recommend this book to other mature adults that love reading about romance, passion, sex, and love.
B000JLSM00|5.0|This is one of the greatest real Western Movies ever created.  I am not a fan of John Wayne, but he is perfect in this movie.  If you like your Westerns with Native Americans and Cowboys, than this movie is for you.  I refuse to watch any kind of Western unless the Native Americans are part of the movie plot.  This one is a great one with a great story, that alas, I am sure happened now and then during the 1800's Western Frontier.
B008MEM24S|5.0|you can not beat the fun you get with this game for the price. It kept my 5 year old busy while we waited at the Dr. office. first Romeo had made it through a visit without him screaming to go home
B0020TS5LK|5.0|If you enjoy watching vampire movies with lots of gore and action, this movie is definitely for you.  Get it in blue ray and you will not be disappointed.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|nice mind challenging game. I play it while hubby watches sports.  even played in the car while on a vacant trip.  keeps you thinking and trying to best yourself.  I play on the kindle and my smartohone.
B004EPYZV2|4.0|I have really enjoyed this last Mission Impossible movie, Ghost Protocol.  I wanted to give it a full 5 Stars.<br />The reason why I did not give it 5 stars is the following:<br /><br />The effort to create a really action packed movie, was achieved.  However,  to my opinion, they wasted much of their special effects by including a sand storm in the movie, with the result that for several minutes nothing was seen but dust and sand flying around.  I guess,  I like my movie clean and bright where you can see and enjoy every part of it.<br /><br />Other than that, it is a very nice movie to spend a couple of hours on, munching on popcorn and drinking your favorite soda.
B0059WTMLW|5.0|I really enjoy this puzzle. It is challenging and fun. I play this more often than my other puzzles. I would recommend this to anyone who loves sudoku.
B0076NAWWA|5.0|This is simply a refreshing piece of, I hate to say it, new fusion. You've got four excellent musicians (I am of the belief that Steve Morse is simply the best compositional composer out there these days), and then this new, relatively unknown singer. He ain't Ian Gillan, or RJ Dio. But he's not meant to be, and refreshingly, not trying to be.<br /><br />If you want Deep Purple, or Dream Theater, or Neal Morse's solo works, this is not a copy. This is also not Liquid Tension Experiment. It is a master class of songwriting talent. I wish people would stop comparing things with and to the past. It is what it is. Classic elements of the individual's virtuosity. Hints of Supertramp, Yes, Purple, Bryan Ferry, The Who, Foreigner, Journey, Crowded House, but done in the way all these guys respect, without tramping all over the original. All Falls Down is the hardest track, Portnoy and Steve Morse all guns blazing, and what a tour de force it is. This is when you understand why Mike Portnoy has wanted to play with Steve Morse all these years, back when the Dixie Dregs were at their height. And what more can be said about bassist Dave La Rue - I happen to think he is up there, perhaps above, Chris Squire and Tony Levin - a monster yet subtle player, he and Morse interplay so smoothly.<br /><br />This is not a pop, rock, 70s prog, whatever term you want album, it isn't really 'labelable'. Like it (or not) for what it is. 5*
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I was pleased to pay a couple of bucks for this app. Yes, I could have kept using the free version, but the developer invested time and effort into a nice app that tells me everything I could want to know about my phone's battery.<br /><br />Want to know how long you could surf the web on the remaining charge? Check.<br />How long can you listen to music? Check.<br />Talk time, on 2G vs. 3G? Check.<br />How long will it take to charge to 100%? Check.<br />How long until a full charge on USB vs. plugged into the wall? Check.<br />How about how long could you record audio before the battery dies? Check.<br />And it's all there with a simple but nice skin on it.<br /><br />Since no one likes to work for free, the developer got a couple of bucks from me.
B004SH40BQ|5.0|Worked right out of the box, and synced right up to my Jabra Bluetooth headset with A2DP so I can listen to all of my music! Small and fits great with my watch:)
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I like this way better than the other calc app. I like the bigger buttons. great and handy to have.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I received the case for my new Kindle Fire and so far it is a great product. It definitely is a good protective case and easy to use. I would recommend this product.
B008MEM24S|5.0|So fun! should add more levels though! Maybe add level maker or cyborg Perry levels! Worth 99&cent; works great on kindle fire!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a \\"can't put it down\\" book.  It was extremely well written. Full of twists and turns....Very suspenseful and surprising. Ms. Flynn makes you hate and then love the characters and then hate again! A must read for those who love suspense!
B0088W5HQO|5.0|Hopefully more people will put a review on this season. SG Atlantis is an amazing series and if you liked SG-1 then you will like this. Lots of fun.
B00005NNMK|5.0|It was the mid 80's, Hard Rock was in, & was here in a HUGE way. It was about to receive a massive boost & Europe's 'The Final Countdown' single was the creation to make it happen. Considering 'The Final Countdown' was Europe's 3rd release, the band were barely known before this commercial gem, for their earlier style & sound was more progressive, raw, fiery & light years ahead of what the US was enduring with their MTV hitting spandex Metal of the L.A. kind (which wasn't a bad thing for that era). But seeing the US was the Country to break to be able to call yourself a Worldwide hit, Europe dropped their defenses & jumped on the commercial bandwagon to deliver an album which would not only catapult these Swedish lads into Worldly heavyweights, but would spawn an album that everyone would want to own.<br /><br />Every track on this release has a straight forward attack with arena fitting anthems that contain choruses to pump your fist to. & whilst the keyboards would become more to the frontline (in which original guitarist John Norum claims to be one of the main reasons he would leave the group midway their World Tour in support of the album) every song could've been chosen for a single for as stated, this was delivered specifically for the commercial market. For long standing Europe fans, it was a letdown since they were almost considered a sell-out for jumping on the \\"Hair Metal\\" wagon to gain success, but either way, no-one can state this album was bad in anyway for the time it was released, for it was THE BEST out there.<br /><br />Now for the haters of today who continue to slay Europe for their image, style & sound, I can honestly say that if you were a child of the 80's when the song \\"The Final Countdown\\" first hit the airwaves, I can bet you would've been spellbound by the brilliant keyboard laden intro that built up to the mega self-titled hit, for it's been proven in over 25 Countries that TFC changed & touched the Rock World just the same way that songssuch as Led Zeppelin's 'Stairway To Heaven', Eagles 'Hotel California', Rolling Stones 'Start Me Up' & Bon Jovi's 'Wanted Dead Or Alive' (just to name a mere few amongst thousands) did & will continue to in years & years to come, for it's those anthems which spawn an infinte touch that just never seem to fade with age, but grow & mature like fine wine.<br /><br />'The Final Countdown' deserves respect...hands down, & thank you to Europe for bringing this anthem for the World to hear in eons to come.
0061726834|4.0|It appears I am in the minority that didn't fall head over heels for this book. I suspect I went in with high expectations and left with disappointment when the book didn't deliver. I found it much like The Uglies series with the whole \\"cure\\" thing, but with less action and more lovey-dovey stuff. However, I know why so many people love this book: the prose is absolutely beautiful. I liked the idea of a society where love is a disease; it made me contemplate the purpose of this society and if the people are still human if they have no love. However, the story it was just so unbelievably predictable where everything was all rainbows and butterflies...until maybe the last twenty pages or so. Delirium is really a love story more so than a dystopian novel.<br /><br />I needed more depth in the world, and the society to make me believe Lena's world-because right now I think he dystopian society is just background information to build tension for the Lena's love story. I should've played Rihanna's \\"We Found Love\\" while reading this: \\"we found love in a hopeless place~\\"<br /><br />Pace:<br /> The imagery-stunning, the similies-lovely, the idea-fascinating, but the pace was just incredibly languid. Delirium was like taking a long stroll in the park, where even the tiniest ant gets a page of description. The flowery prose was just a bit too much for me, making me grow tired of this book after the first fifty pages. I found myself trying to find excuses to get out of reading Delirium, and I'm proud of myself for finally finishing it-after a week. And even after 440 pages, why do I still feel like nothing much happened?<br /><br />How Does This Love-less Society Even Function? (World-building):<br /> Many ideas felt very sketchy and it was the main reason this book didn't work for me. More importantly, how did it come to be anyway. Did all the butthurt, divorced, unhappy catladies bond together wreck havoc \\"If I can't have it, nobody can!\\" style?<br /> For a society where love was taboo, the society using the term very loosely and frequently: \\"I love children\\", \\"I love Examination Day,\\" etc. What left me extremely confused was how love was supposed to be blamed for war. What is this? Helen of Troy and the Trojan War? I also don't know what's stopping another country from invading this one. If the people are all anti-war, then you might as well go and take over. \\"Let's go and take over this society since they refuse to fight back anyway!\\"<br /> And if love is forbidden in family, do children even grow up normally? Or do they all need to see a shrink?<br /><br />Indifference is Worse Than Hate:<br /> A theme in Delirium is how the cured, bereft of extreme emotions, turn into zombie-like people. And their indifference is worse than hate which left me a big confused. I don't agree that indifference is worse than hate: surely ignoring your children is better than stabbing them, right?<br /> If people are truly indifferent to others, then I can only imagine people not working and stealing from each other instead. It'll be a society where it's each person for themselves. If hate is eradicted, you can torture people on a whim and they'd be like \\"OOOOWW, this hurts. But it's okay, I don't hate you.\\" I'm surprised they need a life sentence, they might as well kill off their \\"lifers,\\" since they are indifferent about humanity anyway. And nobody would care enough to complain.<br /><br />These People Have Money and Manpower To Waste:<br /> The \\"regulators\\" (basically police) freqeuntly have raids where they beat people with maces, guns, etc. It is mentioned that the Regulators are \\"smiling,\\" which hints that they aren't so bereft of emotion-but whether it's love for violence, or hate-I'm not sure, but not indifference. They also like wasting a ammunition. Really? A helicopter, guns, and a dozen people to capture two teenagers heading towards an electric fence?<br /><br />Lena<br /> Protagonist who is five feet two, and plain. And in her eyes she's probably ugly too. What's with all these self-conscious main characters. You don't need a guy to tell you that you're beautiful to be beautiful. Get some self-esteem, girl. IF you look anything like you do on your covers, and you still think you are ugly, the rest of us most me morbidly hideous.<br /> I she's a rather passive character. I like dissecting her character, and her beautiful command of language, and unraveling her emotions. I would've expected her to freak out about falling in love though since she has been taught to believe that being in love is fatal disease. Wouldn't it be like being told you have cancer, where you count down the days to your demise? Either she doesn't believe that love is a fatal disease and the brainwashing never worked in the first place.<br /><br />Alex<br /> Lena's love interest, brilliant liar, and an uncured. Just imagine the perfect guy who doesn't mind talking for hours. His background is still a mystery. I hope to see some flaws, insecurities from him because he is feeling awfully flat right now. I have a strong feeling that they will pull a \\"Peeta\\" on him and have him cured, and used to blackmail Lena. I'll see in the next book. I hope I'm wrong though.<br /><br />Hana, aka. The Best Friend<br /> Hands down, my favorite character. Unlike Lena, has a lot more confidence.<br /> I don't know why YA loves having the best friend prettier, taller, more popular than the protagonist. Or do all protagonists have low self esteem? In the YA world, are all the beautiful girls looking for girls uglier than them to be best friends just so they can look better?<br /><br />Romance (Lena and Alex):<br /> I like how their romance built up. I didn't care too much for Alex, he fell flat for me as the perfect boyfriend.<br /> They have dates where they stay in some rundown house with bats and cockroaches (not very romantic if you ask me, but whatever) and TALK for hours. Actually, it's more of her talking and him listening. A guy that actually sits still to \\"talk\\" for hours instead of playing video games...what species is this guy? He is even better than the guys out of Harlequins.<br /> However, I do not approve of this \\"I just met you a few months ago, but I as long as I have you, nothing else matters!\\" business. But I guess Lena is \\"in love,\\" so common sense is out the door. I am waiting for her \\"first love\\" emotions to dissipate and for reality to set in (yes, I am evil like that.)<br /><br />Overall, this book didn't work for me like I hoped it would. Or maybe romance just isn't my thing. Despite the beautiful language, the pace was a test to my patience. If you are looking for a sweet, somewhat thought-provoking, forbidden love story-this is your book.obably ugly too. What's with all these self-conscious main characters. You don't need a guy to tell you that you're beautiful to be beautiful. Get some self-esteem, girl.

Or maybe romance just isn't my thing. Despite the beautiful language, the pace was a test to my patience. If you are looking for a sweet, somewhat thought-provoking, forbidden love story-this is your book.

0375869026|5.0|I'm usually not a middle-grade reader, but the cover caught my attention since the beginning of the year. I've seen a couple glowing reviews for it, but I didn't think much about it until I saw it in the library last week, and I was like \\"why not?\\" I read the first few pages to test the book out, and I somehow ended reading thirty pages...and I still wasn't sure what's up with the main character, Auggie: from the first few pages, I knew he had something that set in apart, but I didn't know what exactly--so I borrowed the book to sate my curiosity. And boy am I glad I did.<br /><br />Wonder is the fascinating, inspiring story of Auggie who is born with a severe Treacher-Collin's syndrome, making his face almost hideous to strangers. He attends school for the first time in fifth grade, and he struggles to fit into the school environment. But he is not the only one with problems as his friends and family also struggle to adapt to him. The story, theme may be predictable, but it's the execution that makes Wonder special. Each character has their own engaging, heartfelt story to tell. Wonder is definitely one of my favorite, thought-provoking reads this year. It opens itself to many discussions, and I wish I read it when I was in fifth grade.<br /><br />So What Does August Look Like?<br />Admittedly I had a hard time picturing August (Auggie) since the descriptions made him sound like everything that could possibly go wrong--went wrong on his face. What in the world are cauliflower ears? And no jaw? bulging eyes?<br />So I Googled. And it was just heartbreaking. Though maybe I've seen my share of not-so-normal things, it didn't surprise me. I can see why kids would be horrified though.<br /><br />Fifth Graders Can Be Mean:<br />What stood out for me was Palacio's uncanny ability to capture the feeling of being ostracized in school. I had a nostalgic feeling of being back in fifth grade (even if it has been nine years ago) and I had my share of unwelcome peers--and I wasn't even suffering from Treacher-Collins syndrome. Like Auggie, I've dealt with \\"The Plague,\\" friends who didn't stand up for me, and knowing telling the teacher is pretty useless (even if you can live down being a tattleteller.) Fifth-grade was serious business, and I was glad I missed the last week of school for a trip--I was eager to get away from my peers.<br />The thing that hurt most was the realization that the 10-year old me would probably not stand up for Auggie. Instead I would be grateful that it wasn't me that they were picking on. Not having a partner for field trips or group projects was not on my list of priorities. Hey! I was ten, stuff like that matters.<br /><br />Characters:<br />I was pleasantly surprised with Palacio's wide spectrum of characters and how the voices still remained distinguishable. Wonder is composed with several points of view from Auggie, Jack, Summer, Via, Miranda, and even Justin. They may be all kids, but they speak volumes. I was delighted with their complexity, and I ended up loving each character for being themselves. I was disappointed I didn't get Julian (the head bully)'s viewpoint though, I was convinced he had more depth--beyond the influence of his stuck-up, rich parents. What I really wanted to see was Julian's parents being taught a lesson.<br /><br />August (Auggie)<br />I have mixed feelings about him. Throughout the novel I see him grow-up, and not use his appearance as an excuse: when he goes to sleep by himself without being told and when he leaves his stuffed animal behind. But even at the end of the novel, I can't help feeling like he hasn't changed that much. There's a scene where he hopes that he will be handsome man in his next life, and his dependency on the astronaut helmet--both of these scenes make me feel Auggie is still the kid in the beginning of the novel. Rather, I think it's the people around him that deserve more credit.<br />However, I still admire this kid. Never did he feel sorry for himself,or wonder out of the probabilities--why was he chosen like the people around him do.)<br /><br />Olivia (Via)<br />My favorite character, and arguably the most realistic one. August's older sister who is starting high school. She's my favorite character for she embodies so many conflicts, but yet still remain in control of her emotions. She is a wonderful older sister. Via is also a heart-wrenching character because she loves Auggie, but she hates herself for the less-than-nice thoughts she has of her brother. At times Via shows signs of sibling jealousy--but yet she restrains herself. She constantly debates what's best for her brother: if they should make him feel normal (and if that would be lying to him), or teach him how to deal with being abnormal.<br /><br />Justin:<br />Via's boyfriend. He is the passive observer who at first doesn't know how to react to Auggie. I had my reservations since his lack of capitalization irked me, reminding me of Omegle conversations with illiterate people (I imagine him talking in slurs.) He also seemed like a very reserved character. But even he does some surprising things that made me like him instantly.<br /><br />Summer:<br />One of Auggie's friends. Honestly, I find her the most unrealistic character. Not being she's super nice (which she is), but because her actions are idealized. Why would you sit down and immediately start making a list of names with a kid you just met? I am not sure how good of a conversation started that is in real life.<br /><br />Ending:<br />I was bracing myself for a happy, cheesy ending--and I got the unrealistic, happy, cheesy ending I secretly didn't want. Oh well, at least it tied well to Auggie's belief that \\"everyone deserves a standing ovation.\\"<br /><br />Despite the cheesy ending, I fell in love with Wonder. There are points in the book I wasn't a big fan of such as the whole precept idea. I just thought that was unnecessary and even slightly lame. But I loved the multiple perspectives, and the astronaut helmet.

B004132HZS|5.0|Setting the stories in 21st century London gives the producers the freedom to create story lines that don't offend people like me, who usually wince when their favorite books are made into movies.  And the characters!  And the development of the relationship between Sherlock and Watson!  Those two actors hit the ground running and made the series irresistible from minute one. Only Moriarity disappoints... but not very much.

1931559317|5.0|This is the best atlas I have ever held in my hands and I strongly recommend it but it does not meet the requirements for the declared use \\"at the telescope\\" (pocket atlas).<br /><br />1) Too many redundant pages. The only pages you need at the telescope are charts and index. All other pages except cover can be either printed separately or provided electronically. The latter option is preferable because you buy a pocket atlas not for the information but for the design and printing.<br /><br />2) Too many redundant information on charts. What is good for a table-top atlas can be bad for a pocket atlas. I understand that by \\"dissecting\\" Sky Atlas 2000.0 we largely reduce the production cost but in this way we will never obtain a good pocket atlas. To be more specific, a perfect chart is the best copy of what you see on the sky plus minimum required information. According to this principle: i) ecliptic, coordinate grid (except in margins), proper names are redundant; ii) constellation and object names should be abbreviated, margins can be used for the detailed information; iii) label-connecting lines must be used only if the unique label identification is impossible; iv) bright nebula should be colored in more \\"pastel\\" color; v) there is no need to make the Sirius so big - star magnitude scale must be redesigned - we need clear magnitude distinction for faint stars and don't need this for bright stars; vi) overcrowded regions should be detailed on the separate high resolution charts while only the minimum labeling must be left on the main chart; vii) spaces inside the labels are usually redundant.<br /><br />3) The chosen partitioning of the sky is good probably for a meridian telescope in Equador but not for an open sky in US. The only solution I see at the atlas scale is to partition by constellation and asterisms. It is not trivial but it worths to be done.<br /><br />4) Portrait format for charts would be useful only in two-page view but the latter is inconvenientat the telescope: you must be able to hold the atlas in one hand. From this point of view the page-size can be increased if needed.<br /><br />5) The largest field of view of a telescope is rarely larger than 1 degree, therefore ideally each 1 degree on a chart should contain a star, so that the limiting magnitude should be 9 instead of 7.5. The star size for the limiting magnitude can be made \\"hairline\\" like constellation boundaries.<br /><br />6) Without finder charts any atlas is useless at the telescope. Therefore as many detailed charts as possible should be added at some predefined set of scales. This includes also charts for multiple stars.<br /><br />7) The extended cover hampers holding the atlas in hands and the additional information on this extension is useless. In any case chart margins can be used for providing additional information.<br /><br />8) The printing is glossy under the flashlight.<br /><br />9) To address the typical complaint of \\"nonprofessional amateurs\\", few large-scale charts for dummies should be added similar to those in Taki's 6.5 mag atlas.<br /><br />Everything else looks perfect.<br /><br />If somebody decide to make the perfect pocket atlas I would be happy to participate.
0061729078|5.0|Aldous Huxley proves, in more ways than I can spell out here, that the term 'mind-altering substance' refers to more than just stereotypical \\"burn-outs\\" or \\"crackheads.\\"<br />Fueled by the War on Drugs, and rampant fear-based propaganda, modern America is as afraid of a change in perception as ever; while Huxley comes to the same conclusion as I, (albeit in a far more poetic description) that; an altering of consciousness is not always such a bad thing, and can in fact offer very profound insight into the workings of the human mind, as well as mild understandings of our very existence here on Earth.<br />In the words of Hunter S. Thompson, \\"I hate to advocate drugs, alcohol, violence, or insanity to anyone, but they've always worked for me.\\" Open your minds, folks, consider every argument.<br /><br />Profound. Insightful. Expansive.<br />A good read.

1451627297|5.0|To begin, I must admit that I usually love Stephen King's books, so I assumed I would like this one. However, I quickly discovered that this was very different from his previous novels. It reads almost a bit like historical fiction with a hint of King's supernatural and spooky style. I absolutely loved this book and found it difficult to put it down. When I wasn't reading it, I was thinking about it. As usually, I found myself astounded by King's creativity and originality. I cannot recommend this book enough, and it's important to note that for those who are not fans of Stephen King, put that aside and read this book anyway. I think you will be most pleasantly surprised!

B0059XTUVI|4.0|Mery Streep gives an awesome performance as usual in this film. In Iron Lady, former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is an elderly woman who suffers with dimentia. In her mental state, she frequently converses with her beloved deceased husband when no one is nearby to overhear. The movie flashes back and forth from present day to earlier times and touches on her personal life as well as her political ambitions. Scenes from her formative years as the daughter of a grocer give glimpses into the formation of her political thought. It was in this environment that she learned firsthand the value of a hard earned dollar. No doubt, that life experience contributed to her grit as an adult. The movie may be lackluster for some but I enjoyed seeing the old girl again via Meryl Streep.

B006OFN0SE|3.0|J Edgar is an interesting movie about the life and times of the man. He certainly was a forward thinker that could see beyond the box.

In this film, Leonardo DiCaprio does a fabulous job of portraying J Edgar in various stages of life.

B0012EM5D8|4.0|Bee Movie presents the daily life and worldview of a bee through the eyes of Jerry Seinfeld. Bee related humor and puns are abundant throughout. The typical day of busy bee life in the hive gets stirred up when Barry (Seinfeld) discovers that people are stealing honey from bees and putting the gold product (of hard work by bees) in jars to sell at the store! As a result, the bees take the humans to court. Celebrities are called to testify including Sting, ha-ha. John Goodman portrays the dramatic lawyer who represents the humans. He gives an over the top performance in the courtroom. Renee Zelwegger is Vanessa, a florist who befriends Barry even though bees are not supposed to talk to humans. Patrick Warburton plays her saccharine appreciative boyfriend who doesn't care for Vanessa being friends with a bee.<br /><br />The movie is cute and has some take-away lessons. Little things can make a big difference and every job is important in the overall scheme of things. Kids can learn about ecosystems too.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|E.L.James has a knack for writing the erotic without making it vulger. She gave every woman what is wanted; a faithful and loving man who worships her and wants nothing more than care for her, money, great consensual sex, and the thrill of danger where the bad guy is brought to justice and the twisted girl gets the help she needs. We take the journey with Anastasia as she weaves her way through Christian's life, helping him to uncover his past and heal from it. After many trials and tribulations, the book ends at a Happily Ever After, which just tops it off.<br /><br />I hope E.L. James creates another set of characters and continues writing in a fashion that takes us to the brink and back with believable characters and situations, sexy but not vulger, and all the things women want in the perfect man.

On the surface some of the songs seem a little trivial, but if you really listen and think they are a reflection on Madonna both past and present.  She most certainly kept to her style.

B002RSDW80|3.0|Overall, I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I thought I would. It surprised me. And I like to be surprised, pleasantly, by a movie.<br />The story follows two women, in their separated by time and location, as they struggle to find some sort of meaning to their lives. Finding something that they loved, and felt good doing, turned out to be cooking, for both of them. Well, cooking and writing about it. Julia ended up writing a cookbook, while Julie wrote a blog about cooking Julia's recipes.<br />It was very interesting to learn more about Julia Childs's life. She seemed like a fearless woman, braving a French professional cooking school, and being the only woman. I had no idea she went through so much just to get her cookbook published. And I can't imagine having to hand type it using carbon paper! Oh, my! It took 8 years to get her book published. Insane!<br />And very interesting to watch Julie struggle to go through over 500 recipes in a year! I can't imagine! But what a way to tranform your cooking skills!<br />I'm not sure I would call this movie a \\"Romantic\\" movie. Sure there is romance, but that is more like a subplot, and not the main story.<br />If Amazon did half stars I'd give this a solid 3.5. So I'm stuck with 3.<br />Great feel good movie (you feel good at the end). A little slow in parts with the pacing. Not much of a fan of Nora Ephron's. I liked this more than Sleepless in Seattle though.<br />And I would buy this for my collection. An excellent movie to watch when you want to vege out, or you've just spent the day in the kitchen cooking!

B001RTP48Q|5.0|After having released a so-so Fundamental in 2005 PSB stormed back with this very joyful album, full of catchy tunes that generally hold in check overblown arrangements.  The result is a bag of tunes filled with hooks and bells and whistles in top PSB category.<br /><br />The lead track, Love Etc., is the best of the bunch, being probably among the best songs ever describing the Manic Millennium excesses (and its accompanying video).  Other very strong tracks include the \\"orchestral meets dance music\\" All Around the World and the dance oriented More Than a Dream.  There are, however, many tracks close to being as good and what constitutes as top picks varies a lot as seen by other reviews.<br /><br />This album is among the best of PSB, being close in standards to Very and Actually.  If you only buy a handful of PSB albums, include this one.

B006GHA9QQ|3.0|I have been a moderate fan of Andrew Lloyd Webber's work, but have particular favorites, as I'm sure most people do. Love Phantom, kinda can't get into Cats, couldn't stand Jeeves. I suppose it has to do with the way Webber bounces between major and minor keys more than anything else.<br /><br />However, to the point.<br /><br />Love Never Dies is a sequel to a story that really can't have one. I'll explain that momentarily, but speaking of just the elements of the show other than the story, the production values are first rate, the orchestrations are lovely and, in general, the score is somewhat uneven. It might have been a mistake to open the show with undoubtedly the strongest number, \\"Til I Hear You Sing, Once More\\". It is this show's \\"Music of the Night\\" and very hard to top, especially if much of the rest of the score is a light, almost lilting collection of motifs in minor keys and odd timing. Nothing much really grabs at the emotions.<br /><br />But none of that is the real reason this show never had much of a chance, regardless of the value of the various elements.<br /><br />The reason this could never work or measure up to the original story is that it was mythic, culturally iconic. It is, in short an archtype. The reason no one has ever successfully written a sequel is that there is literally no story to tell. The Phantom is rendered resolved as a character at the end of the first story. There is nothing left of him worth observing.<br /><br />Think of it as an archtype, a basic story that strikes at something human inside all of us, not just something that suits our personal tastes. Christine is an archtype. She represents Innocense and Purity, not just sexually, but also artistically. Raul is also an archtype, representing Brave and Noble Manhood. As an archtype story, it is inevitable they will wind up together, regardless of anything else that occurs. That is the moral, cultural, archtypal lesson: Brave and Noble Manhood deserves the prize of Innocense. In this respect, and in the way they are presented in the original Phantom show, they are rather flat, one dimensional characters, precisly because they are archtypes.<br /><br />The Phantom, on the other hand, is the one everyone associates with, emotionally, because it is his tragedy that contains elements with which we all identify. He has his deep obsessive love for his own work, which can only become true \\"art\\", at least for him, when sung by Christine. So he faces the dilemma of what exactly he is passionate about: the female or just the mechanism of her voice.<br /><br />At the end of the story he has to decide what has any true value, his own creations or human life, in the person of Raul. And we can even see the moment when he finally has his ephiphany that, between his own work and Christine being regarded as an actual person, one that does not share his dream and would be hurt badly if forced to share it, he realizes that reality is more important, and all his life's work is meaningless in comparison. Only then does he truly fall helplessly in love with Christine as herself, not just hte perfect voice. And makes the ultimate sacrifice for her, giving up his reason to exist. It's no wonder that he vanishes at the close of the story. Not to set up a possible sequel, but precisely because his story is told and he is, from this point onwards, nothing.<br /><br />The actual story of Love Never Dies is a valient attempt, but it can never rise above the purity and sharp emotional impart of Phantom, and yet will always be compared to it to its detriment.<br /><br />Indeed, all it can ever do is deminish the characters. In this case, Noble and Brave Raul has become pretty much a selfish jerk who gambled away all their money. Christine has now become a rather lackluster matron with not all that much to do but endure her husband's irresponsibility with stoic dignity and fuss over their ten year old son. And the change to the Phantom almost borders on the pathetic. Now he is a whiny, obsessed stalker who, when he finally reveals himself to her gets shot down rather embarrassingly. He becomes utterly powerless, unable to instill awe of any kind. In fact his interaction with Christine's son is like watching the devil bouncing a toddler on his knee and cooing over it. The image is a little bit of self-parody that can't be escaped in order to assemble the rather mundane \\"who really hired Christine?\\" story nonsense.<br /><br />Personally I don't think there exists a follow-up story for the character of the Phantom that could ever add anything to the character or even capture the pure impact of that first tale. It says it all. Anything else would be overkill.<br /><br />Still, as done here, it is very skillful overkill. You can put it on in the background to have the tunes going. Works quite well for that.

1439190275|4.0|This book contains some valuable information and important ideas about dieting for weight loss. It is marred and made more difficult by attempts to oversimplify. The fundamental fact of weight loss is that to burn one pound of body fat, one must run a 3500 calorie deficit between calories eaten and calories burned. (This fact is strangely not even mentioned in the book.) Thus, running a 500 calorie deficit each day for a week will burn off one pound of body fat. The key to successful dieting is how to run this deficit without without suffering hunger pangs, ravenous cravings and low energy.<br /><br />When the digestion supplies glucose to the blood, insulin is secreted to allow the cells to take up the glucose, but the insulin also shuts down burning of body fat. Thus, to keep the body burning fat, one has to keep down glucose in the blood by holding back on eating of carbohydrates, or more properly, net carbohydrates - net carbs, for short - defined as total carbohydrates minus dietary fiber. Dietary protein and fat do not increase glucose in the blood and thus can be eaten and provide energy without shutting down the burning of body fat. That fact is the key of Atkins diet.<br /><br />The Atkins technique has you count carefully only the net carbs you eat. The presumption is that if you hold down net carbs, the calories will take care of themselves. Well, maybe; but maybe not. The book tries to give net carbs by volume measures, for example, how many net carbs are in a cupful of lettuce. But that clearly depends upon how the lettuce is cut or pressed into the cup. I found it much simpler to use a Weight Watchers food scale, write down what I ate, and at the end of the day spend a few minutes with a computer spreadsheet program containing net carb and calorie data from the US Department of Agriculture. Since the same weight of the food consumed is used for both net carb and calorie calculation, the calorie calculation requires very little extra work, and I found it helpful.<br /><br />The new Atkins diet has you hold net carbs down to 20 grams a day for the first two weeks, then add 5 grams a day each week as long as weight loss of at least a pound a week continues, until your target is reached. The net carbs should come from eggs, cheese, and green vegetables for the first two weeks, then adding in nuts and berries, root vegetables, and finally whole grains - but never refined sugar, white flour, polished rice, or white potatoes.<br /><br />I have met about 75 percent of my weight loss goal with Atkins, so I am pleased with the results. I also like the fact that the Atkins people are not trying to sell me some product - just good wholesome food from my organic grocer. But I found the book irritatingly oversimplified, and I frequently felt that I was being talked down to.
0440244870|4.0|I'll start out by saying that I almost donated this book without reading it--this foray is usually not my type of thing--but I decided to give it a shot and I'm glad I did.  The characters are engaging, the financial denial is funny, and the journey of self discovery the main character takes is endearing.  I was actually able to relate to how Rebecca justifies last minute shopping and \\"investments\\", although I substitute something different (not shopping) in that slot.  Regardless, this was just as quirky and funny as Bridget Jones, and the parallels are even more distinct with the British setting.  Entertaining from beginning to end, and inspired me to rent the movie.

B007MAETA8|5.0|Ok....I am not an old John Mayer fan at all....I like alot of different kinds of music, but my very favorite is country...I bought this CD on a whim for my husband who is a huge Neil Young fan....I figured he'd like it ok, but wouldn't be anything special...well, both of us have fallen in love with it...I do not think it sounds that country at all...I just know that it grows and grows on you and now it is one of my very all time favorite CD's (Right up there with all my Kenny Chesney CD's)...I am so surprised by John's music...Not sure I have a favorite...Shadow Days maybe if I really had to choose...My husband's is Walt Grace...to the reviewer before me....are you kidding me???  The Almond Bros???  C'mon....
B007KOYEOC|5.0|This trilogy was well written in that it was quite profound in that Christian created the woman he wanted from the virgin she was ,but allowed her her very own thought process, not that of the multitudes, or what the norm should be.This  was in fact a no judgement relationship, as she really did not let anyone decide for her ,she was allowed the time to be.A great way to live no judgement only self power .Many hidden messages not just Mummy porn as those who can't see the Forrest through the trees think.
145470246X|4.0|Rec'd 2day. Exciting book and Ms. Lippert's designs are gorgeous but I'm intimidated. I taught myself to beadweave over 2 yrs ago and I find the instructions in this book a little hard to follow. I will keep the book but does someone know how I can get better instructions?
B008IJTFYW|3.0|I agree that this is a great app. The sounds are nice and the app works well. But the loops have some rather noticeable gaps. The endings of many of the sound clips do not transition well back to the beginning when the clip repeats. perhaps this is intentional so you will buy the paid app? other than that... nice app.
B007DJUO8O|1.0|I have been a porkupine Tree fan since the first time<br />i seen them in 2001 but have to say Storm Corrosion is<br />an album i wish i had not bought. Thought Steve didn't put<br />to much into this one.  Simply said not worth the money.
B001JQHQWE|4.0|This is a good album.  It was one of the earlier albums I purchased as a young teenager.  However, as an aging lady now, I was looking for Crstian gospel.  I was very surprised to find this under that genre,  as everyone knows Cat Stevens turned to Islam, a 'religion'  far removed from Christianity.
B007O3QC8K|5.0|a<br /><br />The Bruckner 9th has been in my head for over 50 years, and I've listened to several attempts to finish it off.<br /><br />At last - one that works!<br /><br />It flows, and it sounds like Bruckner.<br /><br />As expected, Rattle and the Berlin Philharmonic do a good job with Bruckner.<br /><br />Lovers of this symphony and persons curious about extensions and completions after the fact should get this CD.
B004I744AS|5.0|by the mother of Valhalla, this app is better than the poptarts I crave in the morning. LONG LOVE THE ALLFATHER
B008AITJ24|5.0|I know some may be disappointed in the turn of events for the characters but I don't feel it was all bad.  It is obvious that something had to give having two babies a part of the show but I still think it is a terrific show.  The characters are still funny and even though I don't always like the writing involving the babies (someone mentioned putting the baby in the filing cabinet; that was overboard), I still think it is a well written and definitely well-acted show.  I highly recommend purchasing this show if you are a fan of Bones.  If you are not, start off with season 1 and watch it through.  You won't be disappointed and you'll get to watch the actors/characters grow.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Definitely my favorite notepad app available on the Fire. I can make checklists, tag my notes, attatch pictures to notes, and even search notes! This is a really great app for keeping organized.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|From the first episode of the first season, my wife and I were hooked.  We rolled through the episodes and seasons and each episode just continued to get better.  At the end of season 3, we were thinking it was the tops.  It couldn't get any better...then comes season 4.  WOW!  It blew us away.  Season 4 is by far the best season of this series and to be honest, may be one of the best seasons of any TV series ever.  The acting is phenomenal; the writing is top notch; the story lines will hook you in quick and leave you aching for that next episode.  And the end of season 4 (no spoiler), it set the standard for season finales.  Fantastic.  If you haven't seen this show, start with season 1 and work your way up because, to be honest, you might be a little let down (but not by much!) if you start with season 4 and then go back.  I can't say enough how great this show is.  BUY IT!
B003THCGLM|5.0|One could practically taste the adrenalin rush in Richard's nerves when he not only laid his eyes on Darken Rahl, but also on 'the reality of Rahl'; namely, that Rahl was an evil entity, having just killed someone right in front of Richard. He automatically also became faced with the truth that he, Richard, was right in evil himself and that he needed to buckle up and get serious; it dawned on him that this was the evil he needed to free the world from, and that if he did not take it serious, he could get hurt by Rahl.<br /><br />Rahl, on the other hand, looked like he was not serious: calm, without emotion; yet intense and quite deadly.<br /><br />The fight was, to be precise, like a clash of the titans - fight to kill. It was lovely to watch two good fighters on each other's throat - it was a moment to remember. It was well acted by both Richard and Rahl. Two immense and equal but opposite forces, with properly channelled energies. A most breautiful fight fit to sum the whole season of a Seeker who is after Darken Rahl.<br /><br />And then comes Kahlan. Her encounter with Rahl was not fun either. She was after all, the protector of the Seeker. When her eyes went RED in the 'KANDA' rage, she miraculously detaches her arms from her bondage thought to have afixed her firmly againt the wall. The killing of the evil wizzard, and the turning of the soldiers and the motsith against Rhal was great to see - she commandeered the whole situation to stop Rahl from having his way with Richard.<br /><br />If Darken Rahl did not flee, Kahlan's magical maneuver could have had Rahl where they thought he belonged - in the underworld.<br /><br />The whole episode including freeing the prisoners was, simply put, exciting to watch.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
0446547654|3.0|I read this a few months ago when I knew I was going to Maine to stay with some friends and hang out. I have to say that while I am a fan of his other works, this one just didn't have the same flow like the others. He uses the approaching dark, storm clouds as a metaphor that something bad is going to happen, and in this story it felt a bit contrived. However, fans of Sparks will no doubt love this, because at its heart is a quintessential love story and as usual a good twist.
B0083GQ2A0|5.0|This movie points right onto the basic question who we are. Is it worth to search for an answer? Is a human life long enough to figure this out? Have you ever realized that you don't have an answer?
B007SGM084|1.0|I read through the kindle app on my iPad. So disappointed that this doesn't come in the iPad format. I'll be buying the paperbacks at Sam's Club.
B006M4F67A|5.0|This is a good version of a classic game. The graphics are nice and clear, and there are lots of game options.
B008JAGZDE|4.0|If you enjoyed the first film but didn't care for the sequels, you'll have fun with Reunion. It delivers the same level of coarseness and immaturity that made American Pie such a hit combined with a somber and reflective tone that shows how all the characters have grown up. Not that this movie is in any way downbeat but there is a sense that 13 years on, all the raucousness of college has been replaced by life as a 30-something.<br /><br />Reunion brings back all the characters from the original with varying degrees of success. Vicky, Jessica and Heather's stories didn't have very far to go whereas Jim and Michelle, Oz and Finch had much better parts in the script. The stand-out role in the film is Stiffler, who carries the film through every scene he appears in - his one-dimensional, emotional tone-deafness is perfect for the non-stop hilarious one-liners.<br /><br />As with the first movie, the first 30 minutes set-ups all the gags for the payoff in the finale. They continue and develop most of the famously amusing scenes. It was great to see Eugene Levy given more screen time and Rebecca de Mornay has a funny cameo towards the end.<br /><br />After a few bumpy and forgettable sequels, American Reunion finally gives the audience something that's on par with the first. While not for the easily offended, if the first one was a guilty pleasure then you'll definitely find some solid laughs here.
B004BSFC46|5.0|We ordered these at 5 months, and really regretted not getting them earlier. She loved playing with the legs of the ladybug and the antennae of the bee. Our daughter is 12 months old and still loves these. She carries them around with her all over the place. I like that they're small, but too big to choke on. I highly recommend them.

B003YL4LYI|4.0|Had a great time reading this book. I think this was the last in the series however I am hoping another book is written for a conclusion.  The characters are well developed and fun to follow.  Each time one was lost in a battle or through treachery I was surprized.  The wicked often get their due but the innocent are often lost as well.<br /><br />Had a hard time putting the book down and was frustrated that there wasn't sixth book!
0812981448|5.0|This book changed my life.  Inspired by Mycoskie's brilliant book, I wrote [[ASIN:B008ND0MA4 Your Mark On The World]].<br /><br />As a mid-career sabbatical, I was living in China, teaching business at South China University of Technology, and trying to decide how to spend the rest of my career.  I made it a point to read several books that might help me find some direction, some focus and when I finished reading Start Something that Matters, I began to find some real clarity.<br /><br />Of course, Mycoskie's story begins with the story of how he started Tom's shoes.  The book is worth reading just to get that story.  Who wouldn't want to launch a successful, $100 million business in a space as crowded as shoes?  Reading the story allows you to understand how Mycoskie's world view informs his entrepreneurship to make him a more successful leader, to say nothing of his humanitarian bona fides.<br /><br />The book combines interesting, personal anecdotes with sound business advice, leaving readers confident and ready to step out on their own to do something that matters.  Mycoskie's style is a pleasure to read.<br /><br />The book is a great read for anyone interested in business or humanitarian causes.  It is a quick read and you won't confuse this with your Management 101 textbook--thank heaven.  It's not a soup to nuts \\"how to\\" start a business so much as a treatise that will help you find the passion to do what you've always dreamed of doing.  The book perfectly executes it's goal.<br /><br />I absolutely recommend this book to anyone with an interest in social entrepreneurship, the fashion industry, marketing, charity or business.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is amazing! You would have to be mentally challenged to rate this as anything less than 5 stars.

B004132HZS|5.0|I waited patiently to watch this new \\"Sherlock\\" on BBC America.<br />It did not disappoint so I had to get the series on dvd.<br /><br />Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman make the perfect pair.<br />Sherlock is as brilliant as ever and it does'nt hurt that Cumberbatch is gorgeous.<br />Freeman's Watson is more of a partner, more of an equal than earlier versions.<br /><br />Each time I watch I pick up new details about Sherlock and Watson.<br /><br />Love it!
B003VANOFY|3.0|First off I would like to say how much i love the audio quality of this headset. going from cheap $20 speakers to this headset was the most amazing and noticeable difference ever. The ONLY problem i have with this headset is that the microphone quality is stuck on \\"Tap Recorder.\\" When skyping with friends or using windows Sound Recorder it sounds great. When recording with Fraps though mic quality goes into the toilet.<br /><br />Pros:<br />~ 7.1 Audio<br />~ Comfortable<br />~ Wireless!!!<br />~ Amount of features<br /><br />CONS:<br />~ Mic quality is worse then most cheap $20 mics when recording with FRAPS<br />~ takes a while to get use to<br />~ Mic is not as loud as i would like it to be<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />I love this headset and plan to keep it for another day or two before returning. If i can find a solution for the mic quality issue i will keep it but recording with fraps for video and then using another program to record audio is going to be a pain. The wireless feature is holding back mic quality in a large way. Also the default software that came with the headset was much better (more bugs but easier to use) than the piece of garbage they gave to us (version 3. something). For the pricing i expected something a bit better than tape recorder quality as default setting (and its greyed out so no hope of changing it).
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I watched Sherlock season two on tv and couldn't wait for it to come out of dvd.<br /><br />Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock is full of the usual \\"Sherlock\\" quirks but with<br />a twenty first century sensibility.<br /><br />Martin Freeman's Watson is no slouch when it comes to helping Sherlock solve cases.<br />I like how he stands up to Sherlock-calls him on his \\"bs\\" with love.<br /><br />The running joke of \\"are they a couple\\" and Watson's blog is so timely!<br /><br />I highly reccommend the series!
1423113462|5.0|While this might have a similar formula to The Lightning Thief but felt the this was more fun to read then TLT.  Maybe because I knew what I was getting into.  I like the mixture of Roman and Greek Mythology.  The new characters, Jason and friends, definitely had different personalities then Percy, Annabeth, and Grover.<br /><br />I enjoyed it and will read the rest of the series hoping to see more of Percy and Annabeth as the series goes.
B004UID2LC|3.0|I was using it for downloading video purposes...then while I was downloading a vid the Internet cut off and it didn't get finished. so when I tryed to download videos it would say searching then nothing would happen...imma try to uninstall it and try it again
B0081KTI0E|2.0|I was hoping that I would like this movie more, but I found it almost unwatchable. Only Daniel Radcliffe would have gotten me past the first fifteen minutes.<br /><br />I'm not a big horror fan, which may be part of the problem; I'm probably out of synch with what horror fans like. But I always feel that well-done horror has some kind of point beyond nihilistic unpleasantness. Often it's a very moralistic point, which you could argue is the case here, with the evil ghost being a \\"wronged woman.\\" But the victims of her wrath are wholly blameless of any complicity, past or present, in her sufferings, and there's never any resolution to her pain or theirs.<br /><br />On top of this, the events of the film are less horrific than merely sadistic. I don't like stories that exploit the suffering of children or animals and the people who grieve for them. That's just cheap manipulation and disturbing on a whole other level--writers and filmmakers who do this seem more pathological themselves than their characters.<br /><br />The movie works very, very hard to be \\"scary\\" and it's so obvious about it, the artifice shows. The scary old house is a really, *really* scary old house...but why was it so decrepit when its owner had died so recently that her papers were still in probate and being sorted out by lawyers? Just how long had that house been empty? Then, not only is the house already scary, it's out on a sort of point which turns into an island at high tide. Why would anyone build a big expensive mansion in such a location, and why didn't it just sink, since it's surrounded by quicksand? There are lots of scary bits with ghosts (or visions, at least) suddenly appearing or sneaking up behind, but it's like a carnival funhouse. The ghosts literally \\"leap out and yell boo,\\" and even as you're jumping out of your seat, you have this annoyed sense that you're just the butt of a practical joke. Since this is a movie about dead children, of course we have lots of Scary Toys, too.The contrivances are just too apparent.<br /><br />I didn't read the book on which this is based, so I don't know how much the scriptwriters are to blame. You could extract a psychological mystery out of this; the protagonist, Arthur Kipps, lost his young wife when she died giving birth to their first child. Four years later, he is still so consumed by grief that his son draws pictures of him wearing black and crying because \\"daddy always looks like that,\\" and his bosses are fed up with him and about to fire him if he doesn't get over himself. But if Kipps has conflicted feelings toward his son, which might cause him to unconsciously hate children, the movie never implies this, so the sudden uptick in child deaths after his arrival in the village has no explanation. I won't spoil the ending, but let's just say it's a head-scratcher, and ultimately frustrating. You also see it coming from miles away.<br /><br />I only watched this movie because Radcliffe is in it, and unlike some reviewers, I think he does a great job. If he seems a little monochromatic, it's the fault of the script, not his performance. He works hard but he's given nothing to do except be grief-stricken, scared or desperate. He's choosing unusual roles post-Harry-Potter, and while that can be a good thing for an actor, he needs to allow himself more range than *The Woman in Black* allows him to display. There are some other fine performers in this movie, especially Janet McTeer and Ciaran Hinds, and all the cast does a good job, but most of them feel wasted. The movie is so grim, pratically the only emotion anyone is allowed to show is grief.<br /><br />This movie is one of the new offerings from the revived Hammer Films Productions, and it reminded me of a few of its earlier, sadder movies, in particular *[[ASIN:B001Q58KXW Blood on Satan's Claw]].* It's also very reminiscent of *[[ASIN:B00004BZIY The Sixth Sense (Collector's Edition Series)]].* But unless you're suffering from crippling happiness and euphoria and need to bring yourself down (and this one will do it), I can't recommend *The Woman in Black.*
B002ZG98C8|5.0|As much as I appreciate Machete for everything that it is - a rollicking ride of violence and sex, in the classic grindhouse style - I also see the message in the plot. There is an immigrant discrimination thread that is honestly more valid today than it was when the movie was made. Regarding immigration policies in places like Arizona and Alabama, the vigilante border patrols aren't that far fetched. If we take into consideration the more recent rash of gun violence in the U.S. it becomes even more probable. Don't get me wrong, I love this movie for all its transparent fun, but that doesn't stop it from being poignant.
B0081L37Z0|1.0|This movie wan not even remotely funny.  I had high hopes for this as I think Jonah Hill is great.  It was a dissappointment for sure.

B001LMO1CE|4.0|There is no question that Coldplay has been the band of our times that really has made some very excellent songs that have gotten better with age. But out of all of the songs Coldplay had made that were hits, none of them is more potent than Viva La Vida from their 2008 album with the same title. It still sounds more infectious and filled with pride and power today than most of the joke songs like Beyonce', Rihanna, Katy Perry and others have came out with put together. The song still has a lot from Coldplay. While they have honestly not been able to top what they have already done with this song in their recent work from Mylo Xyloto, it still is a great must have for your music library.<br /><br />Song: B+
0547258305|5.0|This book...this series has become a favorite for me! I am only slightly embarassed to admit that I am 30 and was totally obsessed with the Hunger Games. When I got through the series I went on a mad hunt for other books that I might love as much. I found a few forums with some great suggestions, including Graceling. Remembering back, the first chapter was pretty action oriented but it still took me a few chapters to really get into the book. After that I couldn't put it down! Kristin Cashore is amazing! When I would tell my friends about this book I would start my sentence with \\"My favorite author Kristin Cashore.......\\"<br />If you like Graceling, you will probably enjoy the other 2 in the series. Here are a few other titles you might like:  Divergent, Delirium, Birthmarked, Poison Study, the Girl of Fire and Thorns (these books all part of their own series)

B0043URV5U|5.0|My wife has been a Bob Seger fan for many years - and I purchased this for her. She is quite thrilled with it.  It is clear and open - the way you should be able to expect a CD to be.  We were a bit leery, admittedly - as purchasing on line you never know for sure what the product will be like before you get it - and then often too much hassle to return, so you become even more leery - but this one arrived in good time and in great condition.  We've been satisfied customers of Amazon in the past and if you continue to offer and supply like this we'll remain regular customers. Thank you.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This series definitely lived up to the hype for me. I thought Catching Fire was the best second book in a series that has ever been. Action packed. I honestly wish there was a book four.
1595828753|4.0|The volume is in very good condition, although it's a little small for my tastes. The pages are beautiful colored and the art, like in book 1, is amazing.<br /><br />Firstly, Legend of Korra fans, don't get overexcited - the only real reference to Korra's time that we have in this story thus far is that there is precedent for a family like Mako and Bolin (mixed element families), which there honestly SHOULD be, all things considered... And that we're building up to when they start breaking ground for the creation of Republic City.<br /><br />Is volume 2 worth buying? If you're an \\"Avatar: The Last Airbender\\" and/or \\"Avatar: The Legend of Korra\\" fan, then you should at least get volume 2. The whole series is at least worth checking out at your local library. If you're not a fan, I don't think this series is the best place to get an introduction into the franchise, but it certainly features a number of narrative elements of the series, so if you like it, by all means, read on!

B008B3H4VQ|5.0|While it's not my favorite LP albumn, it has some great songs on it, including Burn it down, Powerless, Lost in the Echo and In My Remains.  All in all another great addition to any Linkin Park fan's collection.

B000066SBB|5.0|I love anything \\"Aretha\\".  She could sing a telephone book and make it sound dynamic and wonderful.  I especially<br />love this CD.  It has most of my old favorites (\\"Respect\\" and \\"Son of a Preacher Man\\")  and a few I did not have in my collection (A Rose is Still a Rose\\" and \\"Willing to Forgive\\") I know that I wear out the ears of those who live with me and perhaps want to hear someone else sometimes. Sorry, but I can't help listening when I am on an Aretha Kick (This happens quite often). I really would like to personally meet Aretha and thank her the many hours of phenomenal music she has given me and the world.

B005WMQ5R8|5.0|\\"We decided to make the perfect anime film, one that defied all logic or reason.\\"<br /><br />And they did a pretty damn good job. Would you like to know more?<br /><br />I'm not a normal anime viewer, the genre irritates, embarrasses and disappoints me most of the time. There are clear exceptions and that is why I considered the idea that REDLINE might be good after seeing a great trailer about a year ago.  And my god, I've rarely come across a film so devoid of depth that I have enjoyed SO thoroughly.<br /><br />For you, reader, are one of two groups:<br /><br />(1) You are NOT a general anime fan. Welcome! I'm not really either, I saw an insane trailer for REDLINE a year or so ago and thought I should check it out.  I studied film for a few years after high school and generally give even good movies are pretty hard time.  With anime I worry about tired cliche's, weird sexuality, shallow characters and convoluted, un-engaging plots. These are the exact reasons I don't watch most stuff that comes out.<br /><br />Although REDLINE includes most of these elements, it does so in full self awareness and instead of being bland it ends up as one of the most entertainingly buck-nutty things I've ever seen. The sheer enthusiasm and exuberance on display in the wildly imaginative and adventurous visual presentation is infectious. It was to the point that I didn't care that I was seeing elements clearly lifted from standard anime cannon. The film clearly wasn't looking to be taken seriously, it was only looking to have fun and show it's viewers something crazy, shrugging standard genre stagnation with every line of it's hands drawn lunacy. It shirks pretension and to an extent feel remarkably 'punk' in it's rejection of tact and modesty in it's narrative. It's all crazy, all the time. That's not to say it's poorly paced, but at no point does it relax into putting something unremarkable on screen. What it does avoid, thankfully, some of the worst anime genre potholes that normally turn off everyone looking to maintain some dignity as a viewer.<br />If you feel you are someone that can appreciate a unique, insane, joyful and often silly anime spectacle then you MUST check out this film. It's dumb, but not for a second does it actually care. I couldn't even tell you why, but by the end I kinda cared about our silly protagonist 'Sweet J.P', his buddies or the beautiful girl of his dreams.  I guess I was just having too good of a time not too.<br /><br />(2) You ARE a typical anime fan. Well frankly, I don't much trust your taste and you probably aren't reading amazon.com reviews, especially after what I said in the first two paragraphs.  :)lly turn off everyone looking to maintain some dignity as a viewer.<br />If you feel you are someone that can appreciate a unique, insane, joyful and often silly anime spectacle then you MUST check out this film.

0062197258|5.0|I have always enjoyed mysteries; Into the Darkest Corner goes beyond a mysterious story to the dealings of a severely twisted mind and its consequences on others. Catherine Bailey is a typical party girl - worker by day and clubber by night. One time she meets a fantastic guy who turns out to be - well you need to read this novel to find out. Her life is changed into one managed by fear and uncertainty. The story is a page-turner, you will read and read until you get too frightened to continue. The juxtaposition between the past and present keeps you both interested and guessing at what occurs next.It will intrigue until the very last page. This is a fabulous read!
B004O3YGMC|4.0|I use it on my phone so the experience isn't great, but it is about as good as it could be. Probably would be better on a tablet. Worth it if you need remote access to your computer.
B007URVZJ6|3.0|This is a very good bare bones first draft of how to prepare your manuscript for Kindle. But it is not nearly good enough as a guide to producing a well formatted, first-class Kindle book (unless the book is very simple with minimal formatting). I salute Amazon the creating the elaborate software and features for converting an MS Word document to a Kindle book, but this Guide was clearly an afterthought. It reminds me of the Apple documentation of its software and hardware from the '70s and '80s: written by people who don't know much about how to develop (and ORGANIZE) end-user documentation. This documenbt is, however, far superior to the Kindle User's Guide which is borderline terrible. To conclude: Love your products, hate your documentation.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I'm not typically one who feels the need to write a book review. After finishing this book I felt compelled to do so. This is an incredible inspiring story. Adam's darks days and his path to Christ are an example we should all live by. Words like courageous, inspiring and moving do not typically come to mind after reading a book.... These words and more come to mind after reading this book and I found myself saying a quiet prayer for his family. Truly moved....
B0071LLHGC|1.0|This is a known bootleg that has been circulating for years and I'd find it hard to believe that this recording could be improved over what already circulates.<br /><br />many of the fine folks at the ABBs website will confirm and likely send you a copy gratis.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton Abbey is television at its best.  It has it all: character development, great writing and wonderful acting.<br />  Everything is done with such an eye for quality that the series cannot help but impress.  And impressed we are--right from the opening credits where we get to see the actual house (castle would be more appropriate to say)where Downton Abbey is filmed.<br />  As we become involved in storylines of the wealthy who live there and all the scandal and intrigue that comes with being part of the social elite, we get to know the staff who works for them--there in the underbelly of the great mansion's hierchy--working people who have their own lives to live and stories to tell too (which are just as interesting as the lives of those they serve.)<br />  Though some of the characters may appear pompous due to their privilege, they are not portrayed only as one-dimensional people as if they are sterotypical cut-outs but as multi-faceted characters who have good and bad qualities.<br />  If you watch Downton Abbey, you will probably become a fan and the wait between seasons will seem very, very long.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is the best of them all. It could not be better. I love it so very much. it is great.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Cut the Rope is a game that the whole family can enjoy. The game spawned a mini comic, merchandise, and a toy line. This game really makes the world want more. So just enjoy it!
0811874192|5.0|When a dear friend of mine lost a loved one, I bought this for her instead of a sympathy card and flowers. She LOVED it. The idea was to give her flowers that wouldn't wither, and this book did the trick. It's a creative way to let someone know you care!
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is very exhilarating and fast paced. You need to time each move right or your done for. The feel of getting every upgrade and charcater is an accomplished one. That's why Temple Run deserves the 5 stars I gave it.
034580404X|5.0|I found Amazon to be excellent and speedy in the service/sale of this book. But as to the book itself, well.. thats a different story. I got totally hooked very early in the first book, and got more and more enthralled in the story page by page. It was hard as I wanted to keep reading and not put book down but had two young kids and daycare to deal with. I was reading late into the night and whenever I sat down for a coffee, Once first book was read, the second and third book quickly followed and were all read within a week. My husband is going to read the books just to see why I couldn't put the book down, and as to why its sold off the shelves so quickly.  Excellent book series.

B0086700CM|5.0|It works great on the Kindle Fire. It is so much fun.<br />I don't want to stop playing this game.
B008B3H4VQ|1.0|When it comes to music, I only care about two things, regardless of the group, the genre, the history of the group, the insensible \\"evolving\\" rationalization when bands are clearly running dry of ideas (we don't listen to music that goes platinum in the hopes that it changes someday), or really anything except these two things, which happen to tie together: If it shows heart and creativity, and if it has lasting value as something worth listening to more than once.<br /><br />Now, I'm not a stranger to Linkin Park, but honestly, I couldn't care less about their history, and I don't think it should even be considered when reviewing music albums. I'm reviewing this as its own piece, nothing else. I don't care who the band is or whatever history they've gone through. I already know it with these guys, but it doesn't matter to me. This is a music album that I will review as if it's the only one ever created by a no-name group without any history whatsoever. Period.<br /><br />I'll also do another album for comparison's sake so people get the idea here that it doesn't matter how good that band's been before or what direction they're heading, because that doesn't matter. At all. Some will like it, some won't, and people act like that's this amazing new thing to happen in music, and Linkin Park is the first group to ever do it. Go talk to some Slipknot fans and ask them about it. Corey Taylor had a very good reason to resurrect Slipknot, too, and in the absolute worst way possible, even though it was by no means his fault. But let's move on.<br /><br />So, let's just answer the meaningful questions here. Is there heart and creativity here? Clearly, no. The music is mechanical, the lyrics are often incredibly trite, and Chester isn't giving us much reason to care about whatever he's singing. Okay, fine, but does it show some kind of new ground? Nah, not that, either. It's actually just about exactly what you'd expect. You'd have to be a special kind of person to feel any emotion during this when the same concepts have already been explored by the same people, and with words that were a lot more meaningful then. Now we've got that stale, mechanical feel going on. No good. And it goes without saying that I don't want to hear that too often.<br /><br />Now that I've said the obvious about a group that simply doesn't care anymore but still needs some kind of career and publicity, what can we use for comparison's sake? We need something that *does* have heart and emotional impact, right? Okay, fine. Let's talk about one of my favorite examples: Nine Inch Nails' \\"The Fragile\\", Reznor's third studio album and home to one of the greatest songs ever created, \\"The Day The World Went Away\\".<br /><br />See, this is where \\"taste\\" becomes less a matter of opinion. \\"The Fragile\\" had a lot of special things going for it: First, Reznor really, really, *really* threw his heart into that one. The lyrics were excellent, clearly inspired by real events in his life (not the least of which being his suicidal intent after making the album). The opening two tracks on disc one, after like, thirteen years, are still capable of making your head pound in the best possible way. The second track in particular was Reznor's masterpiece, second to none. As far as I'm concerned, it's the most moving song ever made, simply due to the undeniable desperation in the lyrics combined with an \\"I don't care anymore, this is how I feel\\" in all of Reznor's lyrics, right down to the wordless chant he repeats at the end, like a mantra, just to demonstrate that he can't think of anything better for us.<br /><br />Well, that last part is kind of important. Because, to be honest, \\"The Fragile\\" sort of sucked after that for both discs. If it contained a quarter of the quality of its opening two tracks, it would be worth an altar to be worshipped. But it just wasn't particularly good--just like most of the overly noisy and unlistenable stuff NIN brings out literally 95% of the time. Reznor is one of those extremely rare breeds that can come out with album after album with only one or two *really, really* good tracks on them.<br /><br />What was really interesting is, few people even mention this, despite that it's blatantly obvious that most of NIN is noisy garbage with an extremely rare track that is downright fantastic, and is completely different from everything else Reznor comes out with. Yeah, it's weird, but that's what NIN is. And Linkin Park isn't excluded from this--it doesn't get a pass by being good at one point, or you liking it at one point or not at another, or you like some tracks or not some tracks. That's not the point of reviewing an album. Go find a discussion board to rant on.<br /><br />If you don't get the point yet, I'll say it in a sentence instead of illustrating it: You don't judge music by its whole, you judge it by its parts, and you judge it by exactly what you hear and nothing else. It's easy to tell when music has heart and when it doesn't. It's easy to tell when a group is horribly inconsistent in how much effort they put into things, or how much inspiration goes into every song. It's easy to tell when it's solely for continuing a career.<br /><br />So, none of that means a thing to me when reviewing this album, and I'm really a little sick of people always bringing up their past work as if it has some kind of effect on quality. It's like giving Philip Palmer's novels a series of fours and fives out of tens because it seems like every *other* novel he writes is great, whereas the next we can reliably predict to be crap, as if that has any bearing on the work itself--if we were doing that, we'd be handing out zeroes and tens (\\"Red Claw\\" remains one of the greatest modern sci-fi novels of the past ten years, and his previous novel remains a complete disaster).<br /><br />The bottom line is that this album sucks, and it stands alone, sucking alone. Linkin Park doesn't suck. Not every song on this album is terrible, but there isn't one that really stands out as extraordinary. It's just that, on average, it sucks pretty bad, with most of the songs being really boring and feeling empty. Oh, hey, I remember their previous work, too, and some of that was cool, and some wasn't--you know, like every other musical group you can buy in a store. But this album? Yeah, forget it. Unless you buy albums exclusively because it's by a band with two or three songs you remember liking from a past album (hi, Amazon MP3!), go make your own series of songs, because most of these are trash. Go back to every Linkin Park album, pull out the good songs, and make a nice little playlist, like most people do. It's like people don't want to admit that the \\"skip\\" button is the most used button on any music player, but that's the case. You might like a few songs on here, so get those and add them to your Linkin Park playlist. In the meantime, I'll take NIN's, like, six albums or whatever, and combine all their good songs into the greatest playlist ever created by anyone, which will be the length of maybe three-quarters of a single disc.<br /><br />Really crappy album, maybe a couple of redeeming songs, but definitely not worth the whole thing. Go listen to some samples and pick them out. Unless you're insane and just want to buy the whole album, despite having full knowledge that your skip button is wearing out.
B008AT9XOC|5.0|Is it a musical?  Yes, but trust me, it is not the Sound of Music (though I love that one).  If you think you hate musicals, think again.  If you have a dark sense of humor, this movie is for you.<br /><br />Did you watch Blues Brothers (Dan Ackroyd, the late great John Belushi)?  If you like THAT kind of musical, I'd say this one is right up your alley.<br /><br />Begin with a timid guy who likes plants, is exploited by his boss, and is secretly in love with a young woman who is in an abusive relationship (and it's made clear there is NOTHING funny about abuse), then add Steve Martin as the sadistic dentist she dates, and Bill Murray as the masochistic patient whose teeth were fine, but sees the dentist because he loves pain...and, ahem.  A very small carnivorous plant, and there's your movie.  (I have not seen the Director's Cut version, but it's on my wish list!)<br /><br />To say more would spoil the fun. I hope I've said enough to convince you that if you have a fondness for edgy humor, this movie is YOUR movie!

B0015FN05Q|4.0|Great story. Beautiful, which is why I give it a high rating. However, the Kindle edition has more typos than any professionally produced publication I have ever seen. Whoever is responsible for this should be taken out and beaten severely. It really is a horrible job of editing.

B008BRC6NS|5.0|My score of Dance Again... The Hits is based only on the two new songs- not on the track listing or previous listed songs (Although I will comment on them). 'Dance Again' is a fun uplifting dance track produced by Red One and featuring rapper Pitbull. It's a nice edition to Jennifer Lopez's repetoire if your a fan of 'On the Floor'.<br />'Goin' In' is a very fast uptempo dance song that is lead single for the soundtrack for Step Up Revolution. It features Flo Rida and may not be for everyone, but is a nice continuation of where Love? left off.<br />The track list for Dance Again... The Hits is sporadic and doesn't flow particularly well, yet at the same time spanning eight different albums I would have never expected it to flow well either. 'All I Have' only appears on the deluxe edition, which considering it's peak at number one seems odd. However, when you ask someone to name a Jennifer Lopez song they'll 'Jenny From the Block' or 'I'm Real' both of which are more iconic even if they peaked lower on the charts. One song is missing that shouldn't be, and that would be 'Play' from her second studio album J. Lo. It peaked higher then 'Let's Get Loud', 'Do It Well', 'Feelin' So Good', 'I'm Into You', and 'Que Hiciste' and yet is notably absent from either track listing. Someone forgot to play her mother f****** song (Quoting). Also one strange flaw is 'Feelin' So Good' is called a remix and yet it is the same version from the album On the 6.<br />When it comes to the music videos I really have no opinion as I have only seen a few of them before this realease. However, I love her video for song 'Papi', and it should have been included. I'm not saying it should have replaced one of the other videos I just think it should have been included on the tracklisting.<br />My last and final critique is the disappointment of not seeing 'Louboutins' (Meant to be lead single for seventh studio album Love?) or 'Fresh Out the Oven' (Promotional song featuring Pitbull) on the record.Since, they were never released on a physical format and both charted on the dance/club play chart I feel they should have been included. However, I may be alone in that feeling. Either way long live Jennifer Lopez and I can't wait for her next studio album to come out. This is a must if you love Jennifer.

I tried but couldn't get another one here in New Zealand back then (about 25yrs ago!)<br />I just had to get it when I found it on Amazon, and OMG what a blast from the past!

B003Y5H5HO|4.0|Realistic, graphic and suspenseful.  Couldn't take my eyes off the movie for fear of missing something.  This movie is based upon the first book in a series of three by Stieg Larsson. The girl plays a brilliant researcher who helps track down a woman missing for 40 years.

B003EVWDR0|1.0|One of the most relentlessly imbecilic movies I have ever seen.  Practically all of the military are mindless, bloodthirsty thugs, give to pointless, random destruction.  Of course the boogyman is an evil corporation (what else!) willing to kill and destroy anything in its path in a cold, cruel quest for filthy lucre.  Incidentally, the object of their evil lust is an element called \\"unobtainium\\" (I could NOT make this stuff up!)  And naturally the innocent natives are beautiful, spiritual beings, at one with nature, and...Oh, never mind.  Just insert the most puerile, inane, new-agey drivel you've ever heard here and you've got 'em.  Ironically, an evil corporation made this drek in a cold, cruel quest for filthy lucre.<br /><br />That being said, this is undoubtedly the most visually beautiful movie I have ever seen.  If you can borrow it, and can endure the nauseating, self-righteous preaching of the script, you should see it.  Don't encourage the evil corporation by giving them your money though.  You may need it for an airsickness bag.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game was just perfect<br /> there were no bugs. but the glitch for this game didn't seem to work. overall its good
B005974CNA|5.0|While I'm willing to bet heavily on the fact that no one wanted to see Mike Portnoy go, they absolutely chose the right man for the job. Mike Mangini is the only drummer on earth I feel comfortable comparing to Terry Bozzio and he fills Mike Portnoy's shoes very well and that is no small task. I'm a prog geek and big DT fan so feel free to take this review with a grain of salt.<br /><br />I'll be brief. If you like prog, you'll love this record. Start to finish it's at times heavy, melodic and just beautiful. The lyrics well thought out and meaningful and beautifully interpreted by James LaBrie. As a musician myself, I appreciate this band for the fact that they've spent countless hours working their tails off to excel (from a technical perspective) at their respective instruments. What they do with the results of that obsessive work ethic is the true gift that they share with us.<br /><br />This record like the others that led up to it blew me away. Buy it and enjoy.
B007ARJF6G|5.0|One of Madonna's coolest albums in years.  I've been a fan since the 80s.  Definitely like turn up the radio and mnda tracks
B007V5CF5K|1.0|This game would have been fun except for setting the train clock in Chapter 5.  I read every walkthrough and nothing worked.  I started the game again, hoping a new set of times might work, and exactly the same thing happened.  Very irritating, especially as it seems this is a common problem the developer should have fixed.  So if you are thinking of purchasing this game,  be aware.
B00843TZJ2|5.0|Another one for us to wallow in.  As I write this,  the Croz' and Stills-ified version of Graham Nash's marvelous though controversial 'Almost Gone'  has yielded to the unofficial ballad of Crosby, Stills and Nash, 'Wasted on the Way'.  All last night I watched the DVD, amazed at the camaraderie of these guys you probably wish you had as your three favorite uncles by now if you are reading this.<br /><br />'So, Nash maven, why does THIS release go off the radar?'<br /><br />Graham being as sincere, consistent and likable as ever, it's always good to see and hear him.  David Crosby has come up with a fine song in 'Radio', and is also in good form.  The surprise is how pumped up Stephen Stills is - with a plethora of songs and an overflow of licks, he is allowed to shine, and C/N add just that much more - for example - \\"Do you think she loves you?  Do you think at all?\\" in 'Bluebird'.  As a result, CSN are at the top of their game, and successfully pull off a few numbers they have not performed in years.  ('Johnny's Garden' turns into a charming duet with the ever-youthful Nash, the trio can still make one shiver singing 'As I Come of Age', 'So Begins the Task' is everything ALL THREE wanted -- admit it, Stephen! - and OH, YES.  They DID IT.  Wait till the grand finale.  You're gonna love it...)<br /><br />Shayne Fontayne is simply the top of the line as one of a stellar supporting cast;  not forgetting the indispensable James Raymond, who overflows with talent and has learned that less is more on 'Deja Vu'.  Graham looked delighted as always to introduce CSN's backup band....  and there is plenty to look at, you gotta get this if you can't afford front row seats for their tour this year.  Good to have this, as it's been a long time coming INDEED, and ...  oh, yes.  I DID mention the grand finale.  Expect fireworks!  Love you, David, Stephen and Graham.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|Rush has delivered...<br /><br />I am trying to find the right combination of words to describe this album but it is difficult...first and foremost it is a bloody beautiful album...the music, the lyrics, the arrangements, everything flows so perfectly, smoothly...it is beautiful...<br /><br />There is a huge amount of maturity yet it is also very powerful and fresh at the same time...the music is so enthusiastic, it is impossible to believe that it is the 38th year these guys are making music...<br /><br />I am listening to the album while writing this review and i am smiling...Neil, Geddy, Alex i salute you...<br /><br />Rush is certainly NOT \\"losing it\\"...

I don't know what all of the other reviewers are talking about. Btw it might help to Sync your device before downloading apps. Its faster.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Yesterday, I had purchased this book and today I have finished it... and I must say, I love it.<br /><br />The sex scenes are, in the beginning, serious but as the book goes on I really just had the desire to laugh about them. This  is my only complaint.<br /><br />THe main character, Anastasia, is somebody that most girls and women would be able to relate to. I have done the same myself. She is insecure about her body and her relationship with Christian Grey, she's stubborn and she wants the perfect relationship. She wants to change Mr. Grey into somebody who loves himself. It really does draw you in if you can get past the sex scenes.<br /><br />A lot of people have compared it to Twilight, and yes, it is similar. It is written in teenager like fashion but that just makes it that much more easy to relate to and understand. It is a love story, they do instantly fall in love, and they do end up leaving each other in the end but it has an entirely different plot line and it doesn't have any sparkly vampires.<br /><br />There is also a bit of humor that one could appeal to in the relationship between Christian and Anastasia. If you notice, in the emails from Christian to Anastasia, he will sometimes change his position in the signature of the emails. If you pick up on it, I promise it will provide a bit of entertainment within the seriousness of this book.<br /><br />Another thing that makes the book so able to be related to is the jealousy and the normal emotions that most people go through. All in all, this book is filled with major emotional appeals. It goes as far as Anastasia making Christian jealous by hugging her best friend to a heart break that will blow your mind. This book covers the good and the bad of everyone's emotions and definitely allows you to appeal and relate.<br /><br />All in all, it is an exceptional read and I am already 8% into the second book, if that tells you anything. It is a read that I would suggest to all of my friends.<br /><br />I loved it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is awesome. It challenges your mind and spacial reasoning skills. The only bad part is I can't put it down. More levels please!!!
B0086700CM|4.0|It's a great game and it would be even better if the user didn't have to connect to the internet to play it. Good graphics and easy game-play make it a good time passer.
B0071DJZZA|5.0|At the age of 37 I didnt think the hunger games trilogy was going to be my cup of tea, since they brand it as a teen thing,  but once I started this book I fell in love and couldnt stop, I was addicted.  I love the setting, the story line and the characters. Can wait to see the movie and finish the trilogy.
B006LSZECO|5.0|the book was recommended by my 42 yr old daughter, so I purchased it as did my 40 yr old the next day while we were all on vacation.  it was a great read, each day I changed my mind about who done it. it was full of twists and turns
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The Hunger Games trilogy is phenomenal! Best books I've read in a long time. I read the entire trilogy in 5 days because I couldn't put them down!
B001UU045A|5.0|Outstanding series with great writing and excellent characters.  A great mix of sci-fi / horror with just enough light banter.
B002U3CCBK|5.0|A brilliant read - different and fun.  Watching the plot unfold, and getting to know the characters, by reading between the lines of formal emails and other correspondence was fascinating, as was the whole concept of salmon fishing in a desert.  Not at all believable at first, but the author made the story and his characters totally convincing and I was hooked from the first page.  I was only sorry when the story ended.
1597801585|1.0|One of the few books I've truly disliked!  I found the characters awful and the storyline weak.  I usually enjoy interesting sci-fi with great new worlds, but this one book was a huge let down.
B0040UAYI4|4.0|Good product, works as expected.  Takes a bit of work to get settings right, but not that much.  Be patient with it.  It will give you advantage on PS3 against 80% of players in public matches, but not against good console players.  It's not nearly as good as a native mouse on a computer.  Additionally, the movement is through keyboard, which is on/off action, so you won't get the sensitive analog type movement you get through console controller.
B006VKKAWQ|5.0|Let me say up front.....with no offense to other great conductors....I am a huge fan of Arturo Toscanini and this set shows why he was the greatest conductor of the 20th century!  Like the previous reviewers, I received the US version in mid July, at a fantastic price.....I also bought the 1990-1992 Limited Edtion when it came out and paid close to $1200.  And I have most of the RCA recordings on LP as well.  This is truly a bargain and classical recording event...very much like the SONY release of the Original Jackets Glenn Gould edition in 2007.  As soon as I got the packing material off, I went to 2 discs that would tell instantly if any remastering had been done...the first and, in my opinion, the best sonic recording ever made of the NBC Symphony in a Toscanini performance is the 1953 Respighi \\"Pines of Rome\\".  I have this version on CD from 1991 and on 2 LP versions.....one from RCA's 1967 series (to mark Toscanini's 100th birthday anniversary)...and a later Japanese RCA half speed mastered LP.  Recorded in Carnegie Hall with the NBC at the top of their form, RCA gave this performance the 5 star audio treatment....Although not stereo, it was in fairly advanced Hi-Fi and beautifully recorded.  Well, the LPs were outstanding with sonorous bass, crystal clear winds and a spaciousness that is remarkable for the time.....In the first CD release of 1990-92 Edition, I was, frankly, disappointed.  The sound was harsh and a lot of the beautiful bass muffled.  What had happened...and this is true for many of the 1990-92 CDs....is RCA went overboard in removing much of the \\"after recording doctoring\\" by the sound engineers to give us as close to the original sound as possible.  Not a good idea.....and Pines of Rome was recorded in sonically beautiful Carnegie Hall and if fared poorly.  Many of Toscanini's recordings were made In NBC's notorious Studio 8H  well known for its dry, flat and harsh acoustic - lacking reverberation and bloom.  However, Toscanini himself was mostly to blame for the harshness of these recordings.  Since a single microphone was used, he preferred (insisted) it be located directly over his head where it gave.....according to him...the clearest reproduction of the orchestral sound.  Unfortunately, it was a terrible location for sonic beauty...Then he fussed over every recording, rejecting for the slightest mistake, but for being such a perfectionist -  ignoring the quality of the sound.....Toscanini was very intolerant of the limits of recording, even in the 1950s.  Had he recorded even 10 years later in the stereo era, I think the beauty of sound would have figured heavily in his judgement.  But Toscanini only made 2 experimental stereophonic, full range high fidelity recordings before he retired and both were rejected on performance grounds.<br /><br />Be that as it may, the 2012 version of Pines of Rome is outstanding in sonic quality.  Not only are the woodwinds, flutes and brass beautifully clear, the bass is full and resonant .....a true pleasure to listen to.  I also sampled the 1949 Eroica and it, too, is greatly improved.  I haven't gone too far in this set yet but it promises to be a real joy to listen to.<br /><br />There are 3 other sets (all available from Amazon) that, in my opinion, complement this RCA edition.  Remember the RCA releases were the Toscanini approved releases.  The first set listeners will want to pick up to supplement the RCA edition is the Music and Arts Beethoven Cycle from 1939. [[ASIN:B000R7G6LI Toscanini Conducts Beethoven: Complete Symphonies & Selected Overtures (From the Legendary October-December 1939 Cycle)]]  Voted about 10 years ago by Gramophone Magazine as the best Beethoven cycle on disc, this series of 5 concerts came into being after Toscanini, a virulent anti-fascist and in exile from Italy, was heart broken to hear of the invasion of Poland.  He immediately programmed all the Beethoven symphonies to be played between October and December, 1939 as a protest toHitler and Mussolini's tyranny and an affirmation in the civilized German people.  Powerfully played and conducted with obvious emotional purpose and beautifully restored by Music and Arts, they are landmark performances.  They were also re-issued from a different set of masters by NAXOS a few years ago as 5 separate concerts complete with introductions and commentary, however, they are not available in the US because of copyright restrictions.<br /><br />The other 2 sets are of Brahms symphonies.  Music and Arts released the Brahms cycle performed by the NBC Symphony and broadcast from 1942-43, considered Toscanini's best performances, but never approved by him for commercial release.  This set may be hard to find [[ASIN:B000001OJ5 Arturo Toscanini Conducts Brahms - The Four Symphonies (1942/43)]].  And the legendary 1952 cycle with the Philharmonia Orchestra from the Royal Festival Hall[[ASIN:B00003OO0T Brahms: The Four Symphonies / Toscanini, Philharmonia Orchestra]]  The 1952 cycle was not an RCA venture and therefore not included.  Both of these sets, for different reasons, show Toscanini's mastery of Brahms 4 symphonies in a different light than the RCA versions included in the 2012 Edition.<br /><br />In the 2012 Edition, there are some phenomonal performances that have never been equalled, never mind surpassed ....by any conductor or orchestra.  The NBC Symphony was the greatest orchestra in the world during its 17 year lifespan...from 1937-1954.  European orchestras were devasted firstly by Hitler's fanatical removal of Jewish musicians and then by the war itself and the painful rebuilding afterward.  Many of these musicians wound up in America and played in the NBC Symphony.  Created by David Sarnoff specifically for Toscanini, worked and built up by Artur Rodzinski, no other orchestra on either side of the Atlantic, except perhaps Stokowski's Philadelphia Orchestra could match the NBC for verve, clarity, attack, and sheer excitement and polish of sound.  One NY critic called it \\"a sonic thoroughbred\\" and that it was.<br /><br />At the top of the list of desert island performances in this set are:<br />1936 Beethoven Seventh - with the NY Philharmonic-Symphony Orchestra.....universally acclaimed as the best recording of the 7th ever!<br />1949 Beethoven Eroica Symphony<br />Verdi's Otello with Ramon Vinay....only equalled by the great Mario del Monaco and the Vienna Philharmonic cond. by Karajan in 1959.<br />Verdi's Falstaff  - called by James Levine \\"the greatest Verdi recording every made\\"<br />Verdi's La Traviata - not the strongest of casts, but stellar performance<br />Puccini's La Boheme - he conducted the premiere in 1896 and this is a 50th anniversary concert perfomance.  Again, some cast weaknesses, but a consumnate performance by Toscanini and the NBC.<br />Respighi - The Pines of Rome & others<br />Debussy - La Mer<br />1949-1952 Beethoven Symphony cycle - esp. the Fifth and the Ninth<br />Wagner's Ring cycle music.....esp.

B00846REIS|1.0|Nothing pisses me off faster than a terrible ending to what was pretty much an intriguing book.  Day just ended this at the end of a chapter!  Right after two new conflicts reveal themselves to the main characters!  Ummm...... HELLO!  Forget a HEA (which is fine w me as long as there is a resolution & good explanation of loose ends)there's no ending at all!!  No closure, no resolutions, no reveals, nothing!!  Terrible, terrible, terrible!  Shame on Day & her publisher for such a gross abuse of readers who spent 230+ pages getting emotionally involved w Eva & Gideon's issues with no ending!!  Im sorry but, just taking a shower & driving away in a limo for the night to avoid a confrontation w a major secondary character the heroine lives w is not an ending. Very disappointing!  I will not be buying the second book, Day & publisher don't deserve it.<br /><br />  Although this book is better written than 50 Shades of Grey & deals with similar issues, I would not recommend it.  The author ends the book without resolving a single one of the conflicts & issues!!  The book just stops at the end of a chapter!<br /><br />  Christian Grey & Gideon do have alot in common, handsome, rich business men who like to stalk their lady loves, not to mention a shared history of childhood sexual abuse.  I did like how the abused is handled, explained, & the emphasis on needing to get professional help to get better. I know/love so many adult survivors - it was definetly  very realistic & I like how it was treated w dignity for such a terrible subject.  I just hope he isn't magically \\"cured\\" like happens in a lot of books.  Cuz I can tell you from experience that crap doesn't happen!  Sexual abuse affects every part of their lives forever.<br /><br />  The more I reflected on the book though, it just made me more & more angry!  It just left every loose end loose!  So you have to buy the next book.  It just quit @ the end of a chapter. No resolution for the Cary orgy, Cary's boyfriend, why Gideon's so effed up, why's his bro's a dick, how can 2 childhood sexual abuse survivors have a real relationship, etc!!  Really pissed me off & I loved Gideon!  I really felt for him & how much therapy he was gonna need before he got over/thru what happened to him.<br /><br />  Basically, if you want any type of closure or resolution to Eva & Gideon's story you have to buy the 2nd book in the series, because not a single thing is explained in book 1.  Shame on Sylvia Day!!Gideon's so effed up, why's his bro's a dick, how can 2 childhood sexual abuse survivors have a real relationship, etc!!  Really pissed me off & I loved Gideon!  I really felt for him & how much therapy he was gonna need before he got over/thru what happened to him.<br /><br />  Basically, if you want any type of closure or resolution to Eva & Gideon's story you have to buy the 2nd book in the series, because not a single thing is explained in book 1.

1455869880|5.0|There aren't many books that can make me both laugh and cry, and this one did both in droves. I don't need to rehash the synopsis, and ruin it with spoilers like so many fans love to do. All I can speak on is the enjoyment and sadness I had while reading The Fault in Our Stars.<br /><br />Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters are two of the funniest, bravest, and most heart warming characters I've come across in quite some time. They make you aware of your own mortality, your own misgivings, your own successes and failures, and make you want to make the Universe notice you and let the Universe know you notice it, as would make Hazel Grace proud.<br /><br />I have been sitting on my own YA novel, half finished for years. Readers rarely understand that when you make a character laugh, you laugh with them. When you make them cry, you cry with them. When you make them lose someone, or even kill off a character... It is a very real experience to the writer. Maybe I felt this more strongly as a writer, and this is why I want to finish my novel I mentioned. But, either way, I felt the pain the characters felt. I laughed with them. I cheered for them. I wanted to console them when the times were hard. John Green made me care for characters in a way that I rarely do if the characters are not my own.<br /><br />In my opinion, that's a job well done.<br /><br />Also, I want to say that Kate Rudd, who narrated the book in the audiobook version as Hazel Grace, did an amazing job. I listen to audiobooks every single day, and she is the first that I had to befriend on Facebook just so I could keep informed on what she might read next.

B0056BMK6K|4.0|A quick read that requires closer review of the actual plan before implementing. Implementation of this plan takes more commitment than most people are willing or able to make, as it is time intensive and requires a desire to carry out an organized method of STAYING connected to readers over the years. Concise, organized, no-nonsense delivery of his own successful marketing plan. Locke appears to understand that it makes you happier to give and receive authentic appreciation and support in business as well as personal relationships. If some people think he's lying, then obviously they aren't going to follow his plan, which is based on establishing trusting, loyal relationships. I believe he's worth listening to because he has proven the plan's worth and is unlikely to have held back some key component (which some reviewers allude to). After all, he's got his niche market and you have yours; your success isn't going to compete with his readership.

B007UQ5Z1G|4.0|This album definitely rocks!  As you all know, most musicians only have 1 or 2 decent songs on an album and the rest is crap.  Just about every song on this album is redonkulous or..ridiculous for the politically-correct person.  However, to classify any rock group as \\"alternative\\" is clearly mind-boggling b/c there isn't any such classification in general music..There are Blues, Rock, perhaps Early rock but no Classic, Metal, or even Alt. rock. You have Pop from all generations. There (may) be variations in sound but it's still one class or style of music.  It infuriates me how society labels everything from music to people. If you become appalled / offended from reading this, I feel sorry for you. Actually, that's a lie, I don't feel sorry for close-minded, introverted people who think African American or \\"black\\" people are both. Unless your family directly came from Africa, you'd be African. Not both. Al Sharpton and the rest of society has you feeling degraded and confused.

B002MQYOFW|2.0|Okay so this was a good book. I stayed up until 2:00 a.m. reading it because it's very exciting. The thing I don't like is Katniss. At first she seems like this cool, smart, tough girl. But as the series progresses she turns into this selfish little brat who only thinks about herself. Like in Mockingjay when Peeta has his memories of Katniss altered and he thinks he hates her, she decides that she will not help him. She just dumps him and goes after Gale as if Peeta is a broken toy that she cant play with anymore. Another thing that murders my goat is when Katniss is talking about something in an interview that is sad and makes her cry, the people she is with feel the disturbing need to drug her and knock her out. So she is constantly waking up in the infermary. If you took all the drugging incedents out of the books, they would be considerably shorter.

Barely remembered now, Bloomfield was at the time recognized as the greatest of the young, white practitioners of blues guitar, easily the equal of the UK's Eric Clapton.<br /><br />If you love blues guitar and you've never heard this record you owe it to yourself to check it out.<br /><br />If you have heard it you know what I'm talking about.<br /><br />Oh, and the Steve Stills stuff on it ain't bad, either.

This problem of demeaning and mocking children (some as young as seven-years-old) to get them to perform is wide-spread and apparently comes from the top-down, meaning those behind training the elite gymnasts who become the Olympic stars. This sport has to be exposed and the abuse stopped. That the U.S. government has allowed it to continue is amazing (they would not put up with this if it was happening within the public school system). And I also saw the NBC \\"Today Show\\" stories too on the Texas \\"ranch\\" and was ashamed at the lack of investigative reporting on what is really going on there. It was more like a love-fest by the network profiting off the games. Shame on them.
B00000K3D4|5.0|I have always been a Bowie fan, since the 70's.  This is a great little fantasy film for prepubescent kids and up...sensitive smaller children might find it a little scary, but Jim Henson's muppets are great fun!
B00005MCX2|4.0|You know People, I had to knock out one star for this Album, ever since I've heard this band on the radio and heard my older Brother's Album, it just seems to me that they have just beaten it to the ground with that same style of chord arrangement and production over and over and over again! And the Songs being 9:00 Minutes and 12:00 Minutes and 15:00 Minutes Long! Are You thinking about what I'm thinking, another Gandalf Production! Well, just to be fair about it, I'll just give You two of My favorite Songs ONLY! Born to Go and Orgone Accumulator, AND THAT'S IT BECAUSE THAT'S ALL I NEED!!!!!!!!!!
B004IQMXD4|5.0|I have listened to Nicks since the 70's, when she was with Fleetwood Mac. I have always loved her free-spirited gypsy persona and kookiness.  Stevie is truly an artist, and is not at the point where she has to bow down to corporate powers.  She was obviously free to express herself fully...I really enjoy her music.
B00867GJYK|5.0|This is the best animation of all time in my book \\"HANDS DOWN\\"! Ellen D. was great as Dory. She made this movie to be so hilarious from the get go. Great plot by the writers. Pixar's best ever even The Toy Story Franchise.

1579125549|5.0|This is indeed a huge and comprehensive book filled with thousands of mate in one, two, and three problems. If you like to solve checkmate problems, then this is it.<br />But you know in advance that it's mate in two, and, as another reviewer said, you can spend as long as you want looking for the solution. It will help with pattern recognition to a degree, but the contrived nature of checkmate puzzles limits their usefulness.<br />Not so the 600+ games at the back! Polgar has selected a vast number of games (all under 25 moves) that illustrate different tactical shots. For instance, if the section is headed f6/g3, you know that that's the square where the beginning of the end will start. You can spend hours and hours playing and replaying these short games, learning how to spot the tactic ahead of time, trying to figure out how you would take advantage of the situation to force the issue.<br />I find these games to be the heart of the book, though the mate in one puzzles DO make me feel smart.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|If you are looking for a challenging game,  I highly recommend this one!!  I chose it blindly and was pleasantly surprised how much I loved it.  It starts with very simple puzzles and they get progressively more difficult.  I am finding the puzzles to be a good way to exercise my brain......and it's just plain FUN!!!!!  I am 59 years old and I am enjoying this ADDICTIVE game!

B0058YPG1G|5.0|Okay, if you think you can deal with a protagonist who progressively becomes darker, more conniving, manipulative, selfish, disdainful and all around reprehensible with every season then Breaking Bad is your show because that's what you get, along with the best drama, pacing, story structure, Emmy-winning acting, character development, suspense and butt-kicking action any show has offered to date. Not to mention, with how dark the show gets it's amazing how they can find laugh out loud humor in it fairly frequently without taking you out of it.<br /><br />Also, remember to start from season 1, episode 1. This is not the show you start watching at season 4. You need to see where these characters begun to understand where they are now and to fully appreciate where they are now in their lives. This show's very much about character evolution or in some instances; their devolution. Go on start from that first episode, it's the best show to be broadcast and well worth your time.
0345529057|5.0|I hesitated to order this set because of all the comments about pages missing, but I flipped through all 4 books and didn't find any gaps. Hopefully I didn't just miss one...<br /><br />As for the books, I just can't read them fast enough, but at the same time want them to last! Watching the HBO series shortly after reading that part of the books has been cool, too. Book is better, but HBO did a great job not leaving much out.
0151013837|5.0|There seem to be two main complaints from the negative reviews:<br />1. Too graphic<br />2. Don't understand how it \\"makes you believe in God\\"<br /><br />To address the above complaints, and explain why this is truly a great piece of literature:<br />1. Real survival in the brutality of nature with wild dangerous animals is extremely graphic. Try watching the Discovery channel sometime. If you don't like that kind of realism maybe you should stick to watching Disney movies.<br />2. Anyone here know with absolute certainty what happens at the end of it all, and you finally shuffle that mortal coil? That's right, you don't. So going through life you could have belief in an afterlife, belief in God, belief in a spaghetti monster, belief in nothing, it really doesn't matter. Let me repeat, the point is IT DOES NOT MATTER, because after you die no one knows what will happen and what are actual \\"true\\" beliefs. But think about those faith or non-faith things you personally believe (Jesus, Wicca, Atheism, whatever)... Do they make you a better person? Do they make you push yourself to be good and virtuous? Do they reinforce important philosophies to you about being rational and scientific? Do you enjoy them, do they give you a sense of fulfillment and happiness? Then why not just believe whatever it is that you believe that makes you the kind of you that you want to be? You cannot know what happens in the end, so you might as well believe whatever makes you happy or miserable or feel nothing or whatever you want to feel while you are alive.<br /><br />That's it people, and it's simple, beautifully told, and quite brilliant.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really like this book, It is very hard to put down. I am almost finished with it and I want to purchase the second book and the third book. I cannot wait to finish this book and start the new ones.
B008PZZR5K|1.0|This movie is the reason Paramount scrapped this Star Trek universe and did a virtual \\"start over\\"<br /><br />It wasn't awful, it was more like an ok episode of the series, but should never been given the green light for a movie.  To be financially successful, a Star Trek movie cannot appeal only to hard core fans, but must have broad appeal.  This movie had so many missing prices fora the causual observer as to make it totally confusing and un enjoyable for the masses needed for box office success.
B0008ENHUI|5.0|I watched Papillon when I was in Junior high school. It's very impressive film who was ever seen. Steve McQueen it's my favourite actor when I was young. Dustin Hoffman played the roll very exceptional. Over all, Pappilon it's a movie about struggle of life who played by the best of couple actors in 20th century.
0553801473|5.0|As the saga of those captivating characters continues, I am enjoying reading their story.  But it has occured to me that with several more books out, when is it ever going to end?  I was hoping that the dragons would devour Tommen, Jon would take over Winterfell, Arya would find peace, Sansa would kill Little Finger and marry the Knight of Flowers and that Danerys would be come Queen on the Iron Throne and bring peace and prosperity to Westeros, the END.  But the story seems to be never ending, as if preparing for a long long TV series.  I'll get bored with the series if they keep cranking them out ad infinitum!

B0017VG66I|1.0|These are two very good westerns. One with John Wayne and James Stewart and the other Alan Ladd and Jean Arthur in her last film. The problem is the films are not in wide screen as advertised. Don't pay more as I did hoping to get what you paid for.
1466401885|5.0|I received this book for review from the publisher via NetGalley.<br /><br />This book chewed me up and spit me out! It was so intense. With so many extreme ups and downs, I considered calling my doctor and asking if he could prescribe bi-polar medication so I could get through it. I loved Travis, then I disliked him only to love him again. I didn't want to put this book down. Sadly, I did have kids and a husband to feed. But, while I wasn't reading it, I was thinking about it. This is one of those books that really sticks with you. This disaster was beautifully written. Travis is seriously disturbed (he is a bad boy after all) and Abby is a glutton for punishment. I loved watching them go through the highs and lows. This is a definite re-read for me. LOVED, LOVED, LOVED it!
B004HW7JMO|5.0|I absolutely love this show. Im patiently waiting for the new season to come out. R.I.P. andy, the new spartacus doesnt have anything on you. He's not as hot either.

B002RI9ZPY|3.0|Having read the prior 2 books in the trilogy in a few days, I was surprised at how long it took me to get into the final installment. I made my way throughn the first 300 pages in 3 weeks and wasn't that eager to read on. The first half of the book was heavily focused on the Sapo and unfortunately little changed for the heroin of the story (the main reason anyone really reads this trilogy)  in this time. While there are a few surprises throughout, overall the ending was kind of predictable.<br /><br />Good to read if you're interested in what happens to Salander, but that's pretty much it.
B005LAIH2W|1.0|Don't waste your money on this one - real Japanese sci fi grade. Effects are all there is. Acting is bland, no lust and battle scenes are ordinary. Story is weak and the creatures are too ridiculous for words. I fell asleep half way through and still haven't seen the ending. DISENCHANTED.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|There is ALWAYS something familiar about RUSH to Rush fans especially; but this time it is very familiar...the idea of a concept album (that they said they would not do again).  Geddy's vocals like them or not,(more on this in a bit)Peart's unmistakable percussion..Alex's timely guitar playing...yet...as familiar as it is \\"Clockwork Angels is as fresh as when they began.  This is perhaps one of their greatest disks yet!<br /><br />Firstoff, I need to say, Geddy Lee can sing!  And he sings very well...on this disk he does exactly what he wants with his voice exactly when he needs to....some people do not like the tone quallity of his voice and that's fine...whatever...I don't like opera, doesn't mean Rene Flemming can't sing. (he just compared Geddy Lee to Rene Flemming!  Oh no he didn't!!!!) Bottom line is the voice is one of Ged's instruments and as a musician, you need to have control of your instrument; WHATEVER that is.....and he does.....so all the haters can go home....or...in the words of Stephen A. \\"Just Stop it\\"!<br /><br />Back to \\"Angels\\":<br /><br />The typical RUSH virtuosity is really restrained throughout most of the album.  A lot of it occurs in the 1st piece \\"Caravan\\" which by the way is a remix of the one released last year; as is BU2B.  RUSH fans already know these are both outstanding pieces.<br />So if you bought those last year, in the album you aren't getting the exact same thing....although the differences are subtle.  Bottom line is they are both great additions to the RUSH repertoire.  The title cut follows that and is really what RUSH has always been about.....longer pieces that don't seem long and when they are over you want more! At this point somethings started to stand out; 1) Although a concept album, it's still cut up into individual pieces (which is not unlike RUSH) but as the entire album is the story, it's a bit different (2112 was one side, so was Hemispheres) 2) the song writing is the main focus, not necessarily the concept...there are very few musical themes on the album that popup anywhere else; this to me is one thing I would have liked to have seen, but it takes nothing away. 3) Rush is still exploring with sounds and technique....the use of virbrato in several songs is an example as they use it more on this album that they have in all of their albums put together.<br /><br />The next 2 pieces could have been on many of RUSH's previous albums....\\"Anarchist\\" and \\"Carnies\\"  show equal quality of songwriting and again, Rush forgoes vituostic soloing for the sake of the songwriting; they could have done more...but they were restraineed...and it doesn't hurt the song one bit...mostly because everything the do is STILL virtuostic by most standards.  Another thing the resist on this album is their tendancy to throw in a midsong solo break in 7/8 or some other odd time signatures.  Personally, I did miss that part!  But, again, I don't think it hurts the compositions at all.<br /><br />In a few places it seemed to make room for David Campbell's string arrangements which are absolutely brilliant in the way they fit in and put the songs over the top.  This also points to perhaps a next direction for RUSH as David Campbell was the arranger of the Sydney Austrailia Symphony Orchestra for the outstanding \\"KISSYMPHONY\\" concert.....How about a RUSH tour or even one off show with and orchestra?  Just a thought...<br /><br />Anyway, \\"Halo Effect\\" shows that softer side of RUSH we dont often see but they can be really great at.  \\"7 Cities Of Gold\\" is again a reminder of Rush at their best with heavy riffs and wailing vocals. The next song starts off with almost 60's sounding guitar chords and a Keith Moon like beat...then continues in a very melodic way again with a cathchy melody I couldn't stop singing....Not what I expected from a song called \\"The Wreckers\\"<br /><br />\\"Headlong Flight\\" is again, Rush doing what they do ...or did.....it is a VERY familiar tip of the cap towards themselves in the early days....you can hear bits of \\"Bastille Day\\" and \\"Working Man\\"<br />Listen to this one a high volume...you'll thank me later.<br /><br />BU2B2: is RUSH's version of a Sgt Pepper Reprise; but more like the end of 2112; it sets you up for a sad ending.....\\"Life Goes From Bad To Worse\\"......but this is RUSH 'now'...so right away they follow with;  all the you can do is \\"Wish Them Well\\"...this disk could have ended with \\"Headlong Flight\\"....but the RUSH philosophical words of wisdom need to be imparted...this of course concludes in totally atypical RUSH fashion with the beautiful 'ballad' \\"The Garden\\"....in which they leave you with the words I hope all of you take to heart; \\" The measure of a life, is a measure of love and respect; so hard to earn, so easily burned\\"....hold onto that!<br /><br />The one constant thing that always amazes me is how they manage to turn a strange melody with atypical words into a singable catchphrase; much like a chorus (but calling it that seems to cheapen RUSH)...<br />ex. \\"Clockwork Angels. spread their arms and sing; sychronized and graceful, they move like living things\\", or \\"A wheel of fate, A Game of Chance\\"...or \\" I have stoked the fire of the big steel wheels, steer the airship right across the skies.....\\"...Really...who writes stuff like that AND makes it so you want to know the words so you can sing along!  Only RUSH!<br /><br />Fantastic piece of work!  BRAVO!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I really like this app. it's been really accurate and I like how I get it every day.(of course) I also like how u can also get an idea of what tomorrow will be like.
B004LWZWGK|3.0|\\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" is still fresh in my mind and thus opinion is subject to change with the course of time. That aside, it was an alright movie. Performances were strong, with the exception of one or two, and action sequences were exciting. I also love the fact that its connects more with \\"Batman Begins\\" than it does \\"The Dark Knight\\" in regards to its overall narrative.<br /><br />One of the biggest trouble spots for me was the film's score. I kept wondering why it felt relatively unbalanced or unlike the previous two and lo-and-behold, now I know why. James Newton Howard's contributions was missing from it (I think the only theme I liked in the film was Catwoman's; it was exactly the kind of music you'd imagine to play in the background while a cat is slinking around). It was all Hans Zimmer.<br /><br />It took a while to realize why Bruce was walking around with a cane, let alone a recluse in his own house. The general disconnect between this film and the Dark Knight was pretty big outside of knowing where it was coming from --- Harvey Dent's death and it's repercussions. I like the fact that his physical deterioration may have stemmed from that fall he suffered from TDK or the general abuse his body underwent before he decided to up and quit. However, in regards to this plot, I'm not sure why they decided to go with the downtrodden recluse instead of having Batman continue to fight the \\"good fight\\" as a wanted vigilante (I seriously expected them to handle this in the same way did in \\"[[ASIN:B001P5S6FU Batman: Mask of Phantasm]]\\"); its literally the impression \\"The Dark Knight\\" gives you with its finale. What made him give up, what made him (or Gordon) think the death of Harvey Dent would have such an impact on the people that it would force the city to pull itself off its own ass and do something about the crime?<br /><br />Which brings me to another one of the biggest things that bugged me about this film: the \\"Harvey Dent Day\\" and the \\"Dent Act\\" just reeked of a narrative gloss-over. There's telling your audience that the death of a man driven mad has done some kind of good for the city, then there's what they did. The eight year gap didn't help matters either. There was all this talk how the \\"Dent Act\\" helped clean up the streets, gave the police \\"teeth\\" (because that's always a good idea) and how Gotham City was in sitting idle in a time of peace, but honestly there was nothing to even speak of this in the film outside of all the mention it gets. All it reminded me of were scenes from the previous films wherein criminals weren't attacking or stealing in order to showcase Batman's beat-em-up style. But then, \\"Batman Begins\\" did a better job of showcasing a corrupt and troubled Gotham streets than the efforts TDK and TDKR did combined. \\"Harvey Dent Day\\" (its silly name aside) just made me feel a little ill inside, primarily because, I as a viewer knew the truth about what happened and it just seemed incredibly wrong that they were idolizing Harvey Dent like the second-coming for Gotham city. Especially as a means to maintain morale within the city which later, as one character points out when the ruse is revealed, doesn't count for much in the end.<br /><br />The movie doesn't really deliver on the hand-to-hand fight choreography like I hoped. It's the same close-up-cut-quick-paced editing that is clearly meant to hide and not illuminate the action sequence your watching unfold before your eyes. I thought it was the sloppiest with Catwoman when she faced multiple opponents. The chase sequences, however, at least never failed to be on point with the choreographed delivery and flow of vehicular and armament slaughter. I've always been of the mind that chase sequences involving vehicles has been Nolan's strongest point in regard to action sequences.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway's performance as Selina Kyle is something of a hit and miss. On one half she captured the ferocity and unapologetic side of Kyle nicely (she kindareminded me of Eliza Dushku's performance in \\"[[ASIN:B005CSYQ2S Batman Year One]]\\"), even if she jarred me with how quickly she switched between dominant and whatever submissive role she was playing to worm her way through particular situations. (And, yes, there was undoubtedly the part of me that was looking for that aged and silky Selina Kyle from \\"[[ASIN:B00023E894 Batman: The Animated Series]]\\" who played with her cat, Isis.) And yes, her costume works better in motion than it does frozen in a picture. I also love that her goggles play on the cat ears, that was a nice touch. On the other, you had Anne portraying what was basically a unrealized character playing second fiddle to Batman and complicating things for him plot-wise when necessary. She was intriguing, but there was nothing about her that made me even think for one second \\"why should I care about her?\\" And this, I think, is a pattern you see a lot in Nolan's female characters in his Batman films.<br /><br />All of them serve a particular character archetype, but none of them ever actually become fully realized as characters or personalities (either because of their short-lived lives or misrecasting). It was largely the same with Marion Cotillard's Miranda Tate/Talia al Ghul. Instead of giving you a reason to care about her in the same way they did with \\"Henri Ducard\\", she was a brief love interest for Bruce Wayne (a relationship that is defined by nothing and ends as nothing) and a woman he once did with business with for the sake of a Greener tomorrow. Her entire backstory is the definition of \\"sacrificed for the surprise\\" even if I knew who she was from the get go. Juno Temple was just a waste of screentime and talent. Why was she even there when her role could've been filled by any old character actor, especially since the character is not even named Holly Robinson?<br /><br />Tom Hardy as \\"Bane\\" was another weak point in the film. This guy did not embody anything that I even found remotely interesting or compelling about Bane (either in the comics, the DCAU or even Young Justice). He had none of his gravitas, personality or physical presence. He was big white thug who liked to tug on his lapels and turned out to be Talia's \\"gentle giant\\" friend from her childhood days in the metaphorical embodiment of the Lazarus Pit. I had no problems understanding him, but whenever he spoke all I heard was a mixture of Sam the Eagle and Master Roshi. I could never take him seriously at all. The his part in the \\"Knightfall\\" aspect of this film was disappointingly weak when it didn't concern Blake and that was more of a nod-and-a-wink than anything.<br /><br />I love the that the story decided to focus more on Bruce as a character outside of Batman and how he muddled through his non-life in a \\"post-retirement\\" era. Christian Bale gives a great performance here as a aimless and heartbroken man, but the biggest problem was that he was competing with the likes of Officer John Blake. While I sympathized with Bruce's plight, I found myself wanting to go back to Blake and his escapades more than I wanted to see Batman pull himself out of retirement, injury and deal the repercussions of his personal life crumbling down around him (thanks to a thief and the truth about Rachel finally revealed by Alfred). He almost seemed to become unnecessary in his own film, everything happening around him or being told to him was decidedly more interesting.<br /><br />John Blake does indeed come off as a mixture of the three prominent Robins (Grayson, Todd and Drake), but struck me more as a Nightwing/Dick Grayson persona, especially given the that the character is a bloody cop in almost the same position as Dick was during the 1998-2000 run of \\"Nightwing\\". The explanation behind as to why/how he knew Bruce was Batman was a little sloppy, especially since the film seemed to give me the impression almost everyone who mattered seemed to know that Bruce = Batman (heck, I thought, with the way Blake was talking, Gordon already knew before the end of the film). Nonetheless, I could buy it given his and Bruce's circumstances. Blake almost has nothing to do besides chase vapor trails left behind by the villains or Batman, but I love the fact that he was probably one of the few proactive protagonists in the film besides Bruce himself. (While Gary Oldman gives the usual great performance, Commissioner Gordon is criminally underused and almost forgotten about until the semi-end of the film.) The only thing that bugged me was the fact that he had to put on a suit to play detective. All I could think of was \\"Inception\\" when I saw him the threads. I seriously preferred him wearing the Blue Uniform, but it hardly prevents Levitt from excelling with a really great performance.<br /><br />Other strong performances stem from Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine as the wizened Lucius Fox and Alfred Pennyworth, with the latter's only detraction being that he was crying or tearing up in every other scene. I get that he's supposed to be convey his heartbreak and concern for Bruce, the boy he's raised for God-knows-how-long, but I dunno. I kinda expected him to use the same steady emotion he did in \\"Begins\\" and \\"Dark Knight\\", but I guess this was just was the character's breaking point and man did I want to hug him at the end.<br /><br />Overall, \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" was a enjoyable film. It does its best to conclude up storylines that began in the first or second film and the end, I think, wraps up things up nicely even if was telegraphed from a mile away. I like the idea of a Bruce Wayne being able to pull himself away from the shadow of Batman, even if he is ultimately burdening the shoulders of another (no matter how willing they may be to carry it in the end). That, I think, was the only \\"Knightfall\\" element they got right and did it in a way that respected both Bruce and \\"Robin\\". Narratively, I appreciate the fact that it acknowledges and hinges itself more on \\"Batman Begins\\"instead of relying entirely on \\"The Dark Knight\\" like I would expect a threequel to do. If it weren't for the Harvey Dent storyline, I believe you could watch the first film and jump straight into the third without trouble. However, it makes the mistake of repeating the same climax in its finale (where it worked in the first film, it's just makes me wish they'd done something different with it's finale). The sacrifice of Selina, Talia and Bane's characters leaves me extremely disappointed as well.
B0074VTHKM|5.0|Haven't finished it yet but it is a  typical Grisham novel.  Hard to put down.  Although different from the typical mature lawyer viewpoint, the young would-be attorney is so knowledgeable that you forget his is not even in high school.  This is the second one in the series that I have read and I recommend both.

0061124958|5.0|I read this to my daughter Magda (she is two) and asked her some questions about it. This was her very first chapter book. Here's what she had to say:<br /><br />Did we read Charlotte's Web?<br />  Yeah, we did.<br />Did you like Charlotte's Web?<br />  I do. I like Wilber the Pig in Charlotte's Web and Some Pig. (Some Pig is an illustrated preschool book using the text of Chapter Two of Charlotte's Web)<br />Was he your favourite?<br />  Uh (thinking) Yes! I like that Wilbur doesn't get killed.<br />How come Wilbur didn't get killed?<br />  `Cause Charlotte saved him.<br />How did she save him?<br />  `Cause he went to the County Fair.<br />What happened at the County Fair?<br />  I can't remember.<br />Did Charlotte write something on her web?<br />  Uh...a letter!<br />What kind of animal is Charlotte?<br />  A spider. A spider who writes a web.<br />Do all spiders know how to write letters or was she special?<br />  She WAS special!<br />What happened to Charlotte?<br />  She died!<br />She died.<br />  Was it sad? Were you crying at Charlotte's Web?<br />I was. Did Charlotte have babies?<br />  She did.<br />What happened to the babies?<br />  They were dead but they weren't. Charlotte's babies weren't dead they were just  happy.<br />Where did they live?<br />  In a sack. Charlotte's babies went in a sack.<br />That's true.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great book. It randomly came up when I was looking for another author I like - Robert Kroese.<br /><br />I have to say am I very very glad I took the time to read the summary and a couple reviews. The cover did not grab me but the reviews sold it. The entire collection give you a lot to think about while being very entertaining and at times very sad. I would recommend this to anyone. From young adults to grandparents. Everyone will get something out of Wool. There is nothing in it that would be of questionable content for young adults/teenagers. I might not let a kid read it because there are some pretty hefty topics such as death and survival.<br /><br />The characters are awesome, well fleshed out and you can relate. You want to know what happens next, so you just keep reading and look forward to getting back to it.<br /><br />Take some times and read this.
0307744434|5.0|The very last page of Erin Morgenstern's stunning debut novel, The Night Circus, (don't worry--I'm not revealing any secrets) is a list of acknowledgments in which she thanks \\"a number of associates and conspirators behind this book,\\" people without whom the book would not have taken the shape that it did. Although many authors have such acknowledgments pages, in this case I truly believe her. It's not that I think the story is not hers, nor that she could not have written it without help, it's just that the entire novel has a collaborative feel, as though many voices have been heard, many eyes have given their perspective, before the author crafted the perfect, winding narrative.<br /><br />And that's part of the magic of this book. It is one of those rare delights in which the manner of the story telling is the exact compliment to the story itself. The story winds around the narrative, with each small chapter taking place in a different time or place or from a different perspective, yet all leading to the larger picture--the larger experience--of the Circus of Dreams. The subject of the novel--a magical circus that is only open at night and which has many small circular tents arranged in winding circular patterns within a single circular gate--is described perfectly by the non-linear arrangement and fairy tale tone of the book.<br /><br />These are often my favourite stories: ones that could not be told as effectively by any other means. Would Mark Dunn's Ella Minnow Pea (a novel about a town that stops using letters of the alphabet in their daily speech whenever those same letters fall off a statue in the town) have had any impact if the novel itself hadn't followed the pattern of removing letters from its own text as the story progressed? Would Mark Haddon's The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time been as compelling if it hadn't been written from the point of view of the autistic protagonist? (or Stepehen Kelman's Pigeon English if it hadn't been written in the convincing vernacular of the hero?) For that matter, is it possible to imagine Nick Bantock's Griffin & Sabine series written as a straight narrative?<br /><br />Some authors just know the right tone and method that best describes their story, best compliments it and brings it to life, like a dancer who knows whether a piece of music is best presented by a tap dance or a ballet. Erin Morgenstern has gotten it just right. I'm not at all surprised that her book has inspired and captivated readers, just as the circus in her novel captivated its audience.<br /><br />For more reviews, please visit my blog, CozyLittleBookJournal.en in the convincing vernacular of the hero?)

B0086QS7N2|4.0|Clockwork Angels seems to be some of Rush's strongest material in quite some time.  While not as strong as their heyday, I believe it will please both old and new fans alike.  The songwriting and performances seems more energetic and Geddy's bass-playing is absolutely stellar.  My favorites include the title track, Caravan, Headlong Flight, and The Garden.  My biggest complaint is that the guitar parts could be more prominent in the mix at times.
1439102732|4.0|I sincerely love when authors--and, perhaps more accurately, publishers--expand their notion of traditional storytelling by writing a book that follows a slightly different format: novels in verse, illustrated novels for adults, stories that are told in a multitude of media. Sometimes the risk doesn't always pay off, but I really enjoy the effort. Jodi Picoult's novel, Sing You Home, falls into that category by being the first novel that I've read that comes with its own soundtrack. The book has a CD included that acts as a companion to the story being told.<br /><br />The novel's main protagonist is Zoe Baxter, a music therapist who uses music in every aspect of her life, both professionally and personally. While the novel isn't really about music, the author felt that the reader should hear Zoe's voice, since the character uses music and singing so much. Jodi Picoult's good friend Ellen Wilber acted as the voice and musical composer behind all of the tracks on the CD.<br /><br />While I don't think the novel really needed the soundtrack and the resulting CD is probably not one I would buy just to listen to, I really like the idea behind it. I like the multi-media approach very much. And the novel certainly isn't hindered by the music, even if it does stand up perfectly well on its own.<br /><br />The story centres around Zoe's failed attempts at conceiving and carrying a child to term, followed by her divorce and subsequent remarriage to a woman named Vanessa. Her lesbian relationship and her attempt to find a way to have a child with her new wife brings a world of criticism from her community and her ex-husband Max, a recovering alcoholic who \\"finds Jesus\\" in the form of an anti-gay Evangelical Christian church. The narrative is divided into sections that correspond to the tracks on the CD and the individual chapters are from the first-person perspective of Zoe, Max and Vanessa alternately. The \\"Max\\" chapters were actually a little difficult to read sometimes because they were written with such detail and sincerity but what his character was saying and feeling was so hateful and anti-gay.<br /><br />In the end, though, the book was an incredibly rewarding read. I was emotionally invested in all of the characters, even the ones whose opinions I found challenging. More than once I found myself in tears, particularly by the end. Granted, it hit me on a lot of points personally: as an educator, an atheist with many very religious loved ones, an advocate for gay rights, a parent who also has friends who struggle with infertility, a proponent of women's reproductive rights and a person--like most--who has struggled with the meaning of love marriage. I felt like the novel was written for me personally. But I also felt like a lot of people would feel exactly the same way when they read it.<br /><br />For more reviews, please visit my blog, CozyLittleBookJournal.ause they were written with such detail and sincerity but what his character was saying and feeling was so hateful and anti-gay.<br /><br />In the end, though, the book was an incredibly rewarding read.

B00843TZJ2|5.0|I've seen CSN many times over the decades and i feel they are tighter now than ever since maybe the 69-70 era...but back then the Fidelity in the Venue PA was not what is is now and Stage Monitoring [resulting in tuning and vocal issues since they cant hear each other like in the studio...in 2012, this issue is probably due to hearing loss by the guys as well as vocal chord aging-damage] and Audio playback was low quality [YES-Vinyl and Tape rule..BUT..remember the crappy SolidState stereo's of the 1970's at YOUR house, or your 'suitcase' turntable , or eight track ? Or were you one of the few that had Tube and Klipsch Hifi still-lucky you ! ].<br /><br />First off, re: this DVD , yes Steve is erratic, but he has ALWAYS been that way, and age is hard on the Vox chords.  He is a legend, so he gets a pass in my book.  Plus he nails it on The Suite here !!!<br /><br />Heck, THESE GUYS ARE (one of) THE ONLY INTACT bands from WOODSTOCK era...The GRATEFUL Dead [not Further] is gone, Hendrix, Joplin, The Band, and many others, and the others still alive are disbanded like Santana [the Original key Members-ie: Greg Rolie and Mike Shrieves], Ten Years After, Mountain, Sly, Grease Band-Joe Cocker, Jeff-Air, etc.  Face it, IF YOU LOVE CSN(Y), you probably love Woodstock-1969 (not to be confused with Pepsi-stock 94/99), so this matters in 'that' light ;)<br /><br />So when you think of that, its a real treat to see these guys kickin butt in 2012 (sure there's rough edges, but it sounds better than they did at Yasgurs' Farm in 1969 and its in Tune!).<br /><br />OK so its not CSNY&Taylor-Reeves, but they always have had different backing bands, but the Crux is intact.  For example, you cant (really) have the Grateful Dead without Garcia (or Weir) or Moody Blues without Hayward or Lodge, The Band without Helms or Danko, you get the point.<br /><br />This DVD is well done and does them justice (esp on a big screen).  Its also nice to have the CD's as i have had a hard time findingHiFi audio of the current line up.  The band also is great (B3, Bass, backing guitars, etc).  Its also great they got this out so fast onto DVD-Audio (usually takes 1-2 years).<br /><br />Also, the last time i saw them in 2008 and here, i must say, DAVID CROSBY has done a total 180 from his low down days.  He truly is MANIFESTING AS A LEGEND right in front of you, you are looking at the PEAK of his energy in its most distilled and refined form-on par with Hendrix, Joplin, Morrison (it just took him awhile).  You can \\"see\\" the confidence and carefreeness of a Master emanating from him.  Also, REMEMBER, he very well could have been gone by now (like Garcia, Joplin, Hendrix), so its truly a blessing that he is not and he is shining!<br /><br />And dont forget WHAT you are seeing, a SUPERGROUP (the best of the Byrds, Hollies and Buffalo Springfield) still on all four wheels, more or less.<br /><br />Love ya guys !
B005LAIGPA|5.0|Like a number of people who have reviewed this movie, I am not a fan of the \\"found footage\\" film, a genre made popular by THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and several other low budget horror films. It's not the budget I object to, it's what's done with it and CHRONICLE passes that test with flying colors. In fact after watching it you'd be hard pressed to believe that the film was made for only $12 million. Part of that is due to the fact that the film was mostly shot in Cape Town, South Africa. It also uses a cast of unknowns so there are no inflated salaries to contend with. The most significant fact is that CGI has developed to such a sophisticated degree that it can be employed inexpensively by someone who knows what they're doing. CHRONICLE is one of those little films where everything comes together to create a minor masterpiece.<br /><br />The story is a familiar one. It follows the exploits of three high school friends whose exposure to a mysterious object (it's never explained what it is) causes them to develop super powers such as telekinesis and the ability to fly. One of them, Andrew (Dean DeHaan), has been videotaping all their exploits. This accounts for the title and for the found footage aspect which cleverly disappears 30 minutes into the film. Andrew is like a male version of CARRIE. He is bullied at school and has a terrible home life to come home to. At first the three friends have fun with their new found abilities but things get darker as Andrew's problems mount. He eventually spirals out of control before one of the friends (Alex Russell), who happens to be his cousin, is forced to confront him which results in wrecking most of downtown Seattle.<br /><br />The performances are one of the best things about CHRONICLE. Since the actors are relatively unknown, their characters come across as real and the dialogue sounds suitably contemporary. Another virtue is that the film runs only 83 minutes so everything is really tight. It's like the B movie of yore where making the most out of the least was the principal challenge the filmmaker faced. After it's initial run the film had grossed $125 million worldwide, a pretty good return on a $12 million dollar investment. To me that's what moviemaking should be all about. The smaller the budget the more creative you have to be and the greater the profit can be as well. At $250 million, THE DARK KNIGHT RISES will be lucky to make 4 times what it cost. Think of how many films like CHRONICLE could have been made for the same amount of money.here making the most out of the least was the principal challenge the filmmaker faced.

145162445X|2.0|What Dr. Krauss and those like him seem incapable of understanding is what critics mean by \\"nothing.\\" By nothing, quite simply we mean nonexistence. An example: one's grandchild if one has no children. That nonexistent grandchild can never be the cause of an effect nor affected by any cause. If the laws of quantum mechanics can be applied to a quantum field which contains no space, time or particles to render an effect, then it cannot be nothing. The \\"ultimate mystery\\" is how anything can exist. Why is there existence?<br /><br />Barring a literal infinite regress of causes (material or supernatural), it appears that someone or something must \\"just is,\\" existing timelessly and eternally which forms the fundamental ground of being which cannot be further sublated. (\\"I am who am.\\") There must be an answer, yet the human intellect seems incapable of understanding it.<br /><br />This is why I am tempted to the idealism of the Eastern metaphysical traditions. Matter is an epiphenomenon of consciousness (\\"Brahamn\\") rather than visa versa as held to by Western thought.  Perhaps the mystics are right and the answer to the ultimate mystery must be grasped empirically. It can never be intellectually. One does not learn to ride a bike by studying the aerodynamics of the proposition.  Rather, one gets on, falls, tries again and eventually understands.<br /><br />Consciousness may be viewed as analogous to a Rubik's cube, constantly shifting its faces and changing patterns, yet retaining its structural integrity as one. Even an illusion of motion within the eternalism implied by relativity of a materialistic paradigm seems impossible. Something must move in reality in order to generate even an illusion of motion as with motion pictures. Thus, idealism seems to offer a plausible alternative.<br /><br />(A Zen anecdote:  \\"Two students were arguing over a flag blowing in the wind.  One argued that the flag was moving while the other the wind. The master happened along and resolvedthe question with `Mind moves.'\\"  [Mind = Consciousness or Brahman in Hindu terminology])<br /><br />Consciousness presents an illusion we perceive as a transitory material existence. This is corporate solipsism, consciousness playing hide-and-go-seek with itself (\\"Lila\\"). We are all but manifestations of the one primal ground of existence. This sounds far more logical to me than the desperate attempts of materialists to explain the seemingly inexplicable.<br /><br />The mere act of searching for an answer to the mystery of the nature of ultimate reality within the illusion of a materialistic paradigm will lead to another mystery after one is solved ad infinitum because consciousness will always provide one. The goalpost will always be pushed back.<br /><br />What is the arena where everything takes place, without which nothing could be attested to exist?  Did non-sentient matter really bang around the universe for countless ages without any awareness of its existence?<br /><br />Dr. Krauss's book does not live up to its title's promise because he attempts to answer a question that the logic of the intellect can never grasp.
B004SUDQ72|5.0|From the hypnotic montage of its opening title sequence to its disturbing dark-comedy ending, David Cronenberg's eXistenZ is a thinking person's virtual reality movie.  The plot revolves around a star game designer, Allegra Geller, (Jennifer Jason Leigh) who is nearly assassinated during the test launch of her latest creation - a game called eXistenZ.<br /><br />Forced to go on the lam with her security guard Ted Pikul (Jude Law) Geller travels through a dream-like landscape inhabited by mutant reptiles and living computer game devices that plug directly into the human body.  But as they seek for safety, the line between reality and fantasy begins to blur.<br /><br />Leigh is truly remarkable as the neurotic misanthropic Geller who oscillates between frazzled screaming hysteria and edgy mordant sarcasm. It would be difficult to describe just how nuanced her performance is without giving away key plot elements, but I have found my appreciation for her work in this film grow with each successive viewing. She portrays Allegra Geller as a kind of addict whose need for the false reality of her game-world is palpable.<br /><br />The ever versatile Jude Law plays the nerdy marketing trainee cum security guard with pitch perfect panicked naiveté. The movie also includes wonderful little star turns by Willem Dafoe and Ian Holm.<br /><br />Cronenberg's signature obsession with the joining of flesh and machine is on full display in this film. But eXistenZ is more than just a speculation on biotechnology or even on virtual reality. The \\"games\\" in the film become metaphors for other things that control our perception of reality. As such eXistenZ can be viewed as a thought provoking multilayered satire or allegory.<br /><br />Howard Shore's moody and ominous score and Peter Suschitzky's beautiful cinematography also contribute a great deal to this multifaceted little jewel.

0345803493|5.0|The formula for this book is simple --- a traditional contemporary romance novel plus bondage equals a more-titillating-than-usual traditional contemporary romance novel.

B001H9JBW6|5.0|On the boat, Yasim realizes what has happened and plans carefully. When the inevitable moment arrives, she kills Russell and throws his body overboard, an action that escapes detection. She and Stephen eventually reunite. If Sherlock Holmes could survive the Reichenbach fall, anything is possible, right?<br /><br />The best part of this excellent TV mini-series is the love story. I can't help but think that Peter Berry had \\"Casablanca\\" in mind when he wrote it. Some of the non-romance plot is a bit murky. (Who were those two foreign pursuers, and why did Russell keep popping up all over the place? Who was he working for?) But generally, the writing is brilliant, and so is the acting. Benedict Cumberbatch is outstanding as usual, and so are Anamaria Marinca, Robert Carlyle, Eva Birthistle, Geraldine James and Christopher Fulford. I would especially love to see Anamaria Marinca again as Yasim.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of British TV series, and this is now one of my favorites.

B00782O7NE|5.0|I wanted to see this film from the moment I saw a trailer on TV last December.  As a lover of William Powell(The Thin Man), an american actor who went successfully from silent movies to talkies, the short glimpse I got of the character reminded me of him.  And it looked like a compelling story.  I got all that in a 20 second ad? Now that's editing!<br />By now, you are all familiar with the plot - if not, check out MANY MANY reviews that will tell you what it is.  But more than that, writer-director Michel Hazanivicious has created an experience that transcends just a melodrama and/or novelty movie. For those who have not watched many silent movies (or EVER seen one) if you will just relax, turn off the cell phone, stop playing with the dog or WHATEVER for the first couple of minutes, you'll be drawn in to 1927 Hollywood, and a sweet story of famed actor who is atop the world, meets girl, loves girl, loses job, fights change, loses self worth, and is redeemed. But it's so much more.<br />It is the many moments that make you smile, laugh out loud, and hold your breath in anticipation.  A few of my favorite scenes are of transition - when superstar George Valentin (a most deserving Oscar winner Jean Dujardin)realizes the pretty extra he's dancing with take after take is more than just cute. When ingenue Peppy Miller (French Cesar Winner and Oscar Nominee Berenice Bejo) realizes the man she's smitten with is not only handsome, playful and kind, but married. When George has just had a terrible meeting with studio mogul Al Zimmer(John Goodman is perfect),comes down a staircase and runs into Peppy, who, having just signed with his studio is thrilled because she thinks she and George can now do movies together. He's angry and upset and yet can look her in the eye and be happy for her. She makes him forget his misery. Their affection is genuine, so much so that when new star Peppy, on the eve of the opening of their competing films, makes comments about \\"old actors muggingfor the camera\\" to reporters in a restaurant, not knowing until too late that George has heard her and is deeply wounded. I felt badly for both of them. George struggles and falls and goes into depression, yet Peppy(nor his swell little dog Uggie)never gives up on him. When he finally does go to see a talkie, it stars her, and he is charmed. On screen, she pulls him into smiles the way she does with audiences.<br /><br />I love every frame of this film and was really thrilled when Oscars were awarded to Ludovic Bource for his PERFECT score that I enjoy listening to in my car still; to Mark Bridges for what must have been more than 100 fully completed 1920's era costumes that were gorgeous to look at, and of course to the man who believed - Thomas Langman as producer.  I wish it would have won the other nominated Oscars for art direction, editing, cinematography and Berenice Bejo's performance. Other movies can throw millions of dollars into a set piece, but if it overpowers the actors within it, all the stuff is just clutter. The actors in this story never get lost because all the elements of this movie are perfectly executed and balanced. They enhance one another.<br /><br />Under Michel Hazanivicious's Oscar winning direction, the performances are gorgeous and always pitch perfect, right down to every extra, every bit part. Berenice Bejo is magic in this role. And I defy you to find a more captivating sequence in any movie than Uggie's run for help in a pivotal scene! The look of this movie is perfect and lovingly crafted.<br /><br />I could go on another 300 words about Jean Dujardin's tour de force as George Valintin. It is a beautifully layered, sexy, powerful, sometimes heartwrenching and ultimately stellar performance. Played against Berenice Bejo's loving Peppy Miller, he comes through as the nice guy and the superstar we know he is, even though his pride has interfered with his willingness to try something new. The issue was not that George Valentin wouldn't make it in talkies - he has way too much charm and talent to fail. But after seeing another star's awful sound test he didn't think talkies could ever be good!!<br /><br />I do wish all the bonus features in the DVD release were longer.  I would have been thrilled with a second DVD just to hear about more about the making of this charming homage to Hollywood and love stories; more from the director and actors. It would be interesting to have see some of his storyboards and Mark Bridges' costume studies, and of course would have loved a longer blooper reel. It did seem as though there was some excessive yakking it up commentary by James Cromwell in the Q&A section (MORE JEAN DUJARDIN PLEASE!!) but it's obvious he's very proud of this film and the entire cast and production company must be as well. Thanks to the Weinstein Company for bringing it to the world!  Best Picture - OUI!!!  Merci beaucoups, beaucoups!!  As Jean Dujardin called him, Michel Hazanavigenius!!\\"<br />*** Word of warning when viewing the movie.  I had to turn the sound WAY UP once it began in order to get the benefit of the wonderful music.  Also, though tempted to make the picture as large as possible, please leave it in it's 1:33 ratio to get the picture as it was intended. It looks better and is closer to what a real silent movie looks like. (yes, they were square!!) Finally, I changed my TV's picture mode from \\"cinema\\" to \\"standard\\" and lo and behold, it looks just like it did in the theater!!  Enjoy!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|What I really liked about this game is that it is different than other games and that it is pretty hard but fun
B0089IGUP4|5.0|As Greil Marcus once said of a record,\\"If you say you like Rock-n-Roll and you don't love this record I'll spit!\\" Yes, they're on a major label; yes, they've got a good producer; but niether of those things alone, or together accounts for the complete success of this recorded work. What I hear in every song is the rare and intangible committment of a band to the form itself, and the willingness to lay it all out,in the lyrics and performance. I hear so many things I haven't heard in years. I hear a sober Replacements(no one seems to be on a death trip) before Paul became the celeb. I hear A BAND! What a concept. Sometimes it sounds like Springsteen's second album if O'Brien had produced it and if Bruce'd known what direction he wanted to go. To me, it's a better record over-all than the last few that Bruce has made. In fact it's the best traditional Rock record I've heard since---uh---well I can't think of one now. So, as always \\"Whatever floats your boat\\". Let me just say that this record has my boat on the crest of a Sunami headed for who knows where. Put it on and get lost in the past and a future that stretches well beyond sight. A truely awesome recorded achievment.
B000JMKTLO|1.0|There are a few things to know before you read this book. If you want a light Summer book, poorly written, with no character development, and dont mind easily figuring out who did it less than 20% in, then this is for you.<br /><br />As one reviewer said, - just when you think it cant get any worse, it does, and keeps on getting worse.<br /><br />The premise of the book is a Missouri born newspaper cub reporter (yes, she uses that term). Living in Chicago and working for a local, not too successful newspaper, is sent on assignment to her home town in Missouri, to report on the murder of a young girl. Her presence in her home town reveals her own deep psychological issues, and the extent to which her own family is dysfunctional.<br /><br />The plot is very predictable, and doesn't disappoint those who want to guess what happens next. Its got lots of binge boozing, vomiting throughout as the writer explores many ways to actually vomit, casual and kinky sex, and focuses mainly on the reporter and her family. No other characters are developed, and the extent to which the reporter and her family are developed is paltry.<br /><br />If the book was an animal, I would euthanize it. Unfortunately I have to award one star, as its not possible to award none, or minus stars.
B002LB13SE|3.0|Pretty strong and a better made 'movie' in a technical sense than the original. But the original still is more powerful and, a stronger movie over all as far as 'effect'. Worth your time though. Good horror film.
B007N8RULO|4.0|this is one of my favorite solitaire games.  I have really enjoyed it. glad it was a good free app. thanks
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Works like a charm! I used this to attach the fan in my laptop, which decreased the overall heat by at least 5 degrees. And I still have plenty left-over!
B002RI9YCI|5.0|here we have Alan Bennett doing what he does so well. A lovely short tale about reading, writing, the role of royalty and how British politicians care more about the image than the reality of what they are supposed to be doing.<br />I particularly liked the way that Bennett shows what reading can do for the a person's imagination and self-awareness, and how this will often upset people rather than make them happy for you.<br />This is a short tale to be cherished, like so much of Alan Bennett's work - may he live to be 100 years old, at least and continue writing.
B00881VLCE|5.0|love it only wished there were larger piece puzzles. there are lots of great free puzzles to choose from. would download application again.
B003YTLKTE|5.0|A charming story that starts slowly and gradually gains traction. The stars turn out to be very likeable and ordinary looking which adds to the realism of the story, ie. this is not a Hollywood production with beautiful stars. The music is good and the leads are talented. My wife, who knew something about the movie, talked into renting this on Amazon and we were both happy with the experience. If you're looking for a movie that is off the beaten path I recommend this. The streaming quality was excellent.
B004VOBIE8|4.0|Its good.<br />Better than the  others I have tried.<br /><br />With the latest version I am able to make the font larger too.<br /><br />Full featured. Sort of like the windows file explorer.<br /><br />Search works well. Favorites are easy to create.<br /><br />Succeeds on many tasks others fail on.<br /><br />Thanks for the recommendation to try the newest version which allows for easy to read font size!
034580404X|2.0|This trilogy is entertaining if you like badly written, cheap romance novels with a sexual upgrade.  The characters are not believable likable, or even unlikeable. The main character appears to be somewhat, if not totally,dumb. If you enjoy novels with explicit sex and no storyline to speak of, this is a fun read.  The ending is so unbelievable that I kept expecting a diabolic twist or two where there is none. All told, a very disappointing trilogy with a lot of hype that doesn't live up to any expectations.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is a fun game and a great time waster! I really recommend this game! p.s. I'm just doing the for the points
B007PVHBHC|5.0|This record fits neatly amongst a short list of classic recordings from many eras that completely carry me away. It's is timeless and powerful - a tour de force.
0765316994|1.0|Some of the least-loved elements of Star Trek: The Next Generation were the 'it's all a holo deck simulation' episodes. John Scalzi takes this element to a new extreme in 'Redshirts'. While I'm sure this book would have been deliciously funny to writers of sci-fi tv shows it leads to a limited readership and a bit of a train wreck for the rest of us. That said, I enjoyed it up to page 100 or so.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Fun and very addictive for adults and kids. I wish the theater would change up a little. It's a nice to take a break, a pause button would be nice too. :-)
0345803485|4.0|Isn't it every woman's fantasy to meet a hot, rich dream guy?  The protagonist here does, but Mr. SexyRich has a few whips and chains in his dungeon!<br /><br />This is a good erotic novel with an actual plot.<br /><br />The language does become a bit annoying at times.  The constant 'Oh, my's by the main character were enough to make me puke after a while, but overall, good book.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|Some very challenging level, but always keeping you engaged. Very fun. I would definitely recommend this for everyone that love problem solving games.
B00884GR0W|1.0|ok yes the game idea is awesome. but its stolen. yes there are differences between this and minecraft but just look at the logo and you can see its a copy. go ahead and get it if you want but i think its s***ty for people to steal game ideas and take credit for it.
B007RRFUHM|5.0|I cannot stop listening to Kimbra.  \\"Vows\\" brings out a completely different voice than what we hear in Gotye's \\"Somebody That I Used To Know.\\"  Her voice brings out a flavor that I don't hear on many radio stations today.  The jazzy R&B flavors in her voice and music are blended with pop influences and touches of electronic flavor.  It's impressive to hear how well she uses looping her vocals in \\"Settle Down\\" and \\"Plain Gold Ring (Live)\\" on this album.  She also does more of the looping live and it's amazing to hear what she can create on her own.<br /><br />My top three favorite tracks on the album are \\"Settle Down,\\" \\"Cameo Lover,\\" and \\"The Build Up.\\"  The syncopation in the background percussion threw me off at first in \\"The Build Up,\\" but the lyrics and chorus just create such a beautiful image with those sounds.  It's like the broken pieces of her heart as she tries to heal.  Just genius.<br /><br />Bottom line: I highly recommend this album to basically everyone.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This app is great for adults and kids. I have two kids of mine own (3rd one is coming) and it provide us peace and quiet. The learning curve of this game is really short and the game play is addicting. I've also tried the new 2012 version and it wasn't as fun as this one. By far, this is definitely the best game on a phone period! You won't regret it by downloading this game!
B0086DBE62|3.0|I was told this movie was worth watching for the costume design alone.  After watching Mirror, Mirror, I would agree.  The movie was worth watching for the costume design alone.  Otherwise.... eh.
B003ZDZ1WG|4.0|I held off on buying this CD because many times I find that I only like one or two songs by a group. 5 singles later I decided that maybe there was something to this band. So I finally bought the CD and was pleasantly surprised. It's a really good CD. I like all the singles they've released, especially the newest \\"Postcard in Paris\\" but my favorite song on the album is called \\"Walk Me Down the Middle.\\" It has a nice tune and it shows what a nice voice the lead singer has. There is a good mix of slow songs and upbeat dance songs. For being a younger band, and this being their first major project, I think that they will be around awhile. I heard they were working on their sophomore album currently and I am definitely looking forward to it
B003XVYLDU|4.0|Once again Kurt Vonnegut wrote easy but deep book. Enjoyed reading a Kindle version ''Slaughterhouse-Five'' and now I'm ready for next one. Have fun!

1469984202|5.0|This story is gripping from beginning to end.  While it's full of twists and surprises, they are never befuddling to the reader or implausible or coincidental.  They make complete sense with everything in the story, even when they force you to completely revise your understanding of the Wool world.  The story is so faithful to a thoughtfully constructed world that maintaining the suspension of disbelief is effortless and the reader is free to fall in love with the characters, which I did, completely.  I loved every second of the Wool Omnibus and was constantly exclaiming to my wife how excited I was by what was happening in the story, always careful not to actually say what was happening, knowing she would read it when I finished.  Now I can't wait to read First Shift - Legacy!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is a cute little game for the fire.  it plays well and the controls are simple.  great for little ones. !
081297381X|5.0|This amazing book by this unique man is about the rare event, and how it shapes our lives. A very detailed book, it goes after Economist and other practitioners that use the Bell Curve. He shows how we underestimate risk and this has led to trouble in finance. Black Swan is his term for Tail Risk and unexpected events both positive and negative that  has a major impact on our lives and the majority fail to see it coming. The beginning of the book tell's his own story of how a Black Swan event shaped his life. Born in Lebanon and growing up in a peaceful village, only to see a Civil War break that peace. He talk's about how people thought the war would not last and how many stayed in hotels oversea's thinking that it was going to end soon. This sounds familiar, as people in the American Civil war thought it would end in six months or less. Taleb say's that we underestimate the magnitude of such events. A book that does a very good job of looking at our limitations of knowledge.  Highly recommended
B0038BBA4I|4.0|I like the flow of the songs on this album. My favorite songs mix a mellow and an up tempo pace within the same song. There is a good mix of instruments on the tracks, some common and some not so common in music today. There are tracks that are almost too slow paced. The lyrics are thought provoking, have substance and are performed with emotion.
B008MEM24S|4.0|this game is worth it the levels are harder than wheres my water and i purchesed this app and thought it was gonna be like wheres my water but it is defenitly not so thats why i rated this 4 star
0345803485|5.0|Great Book. The writing, at times, may be a little painful but for someone not writing much before, the author did an excellent job. Not as kinky as some say (I can think of waaaaaaaaaay kinkier things ;)) but more than an average person might think of. All in all it is well worth the read even if you end up hating it. Which I didn't!
1439192812|4.0|America is (sadly) enduring a period when radio hosts, news anchors, pundits and talking heads in the American mainstream media are attacking science (especially evolution, embryonic stem cell research and the findings about global warming).<br /><br />This is especially demoralizing when one considers the fact that America has fallen behind Europe and Japan in the field of science and attacking biologists, immunologists, geneticists and climate scientists will just make it harder to get America's youth enthused about learning science.<br /><br />That is why I am so appreciative of Richard Dawkins for writing this book.<br /><br />Dawkins takes complex issues such as DNA, evolution, atoms and molecules in such a way that pre-teen children could begin to get a grasp on them and by the time they get into high school they would be better situated for further scientific education.<br /><br />And while radio hosts such as Rush Limbaugh will go on the radio and denounce scientific models as \\"fairy tales\\" or \\"cons\\" to confuse and deceive the public, Richard Dawkins explains how they really work.  Here's an excerpt from page 83:<br /><br />\\"Although we can't see an atom, and although we can't split it without turning it into something else, that doesn't mean that we can't work out what it is like inside.  As I explained in Chapter 1, when scientists can't see something directly, they propose a `model' of what it might be like, and then they test that model.  A scientific model can seem like a flight of fancy, but it is not just a flight of fancy.  Scientists don't stop at proposing a model: they then go on to test it.  They say, `If this model that I am imagining were true, we would expect to see such-and-such in the real world.'  They predict what you'll find if you do a certain experiment and make certain measurements.  A successful model is one whose predictions come out right, especially if they survive the test experiment.  And if the predictions come out right, we hope it means the model probably represents the truth, or at least a part of the truth.<br /><br />Sometimes the predictions don't come out right, and so scientists go back and adjust the model, or think up a new one and then go on to test that.  Either way this process of proposing a model and testing it -  what we call the `scientific method' - has a much better chance of getting at the way things really are than even the most imaginative and beautiful myth invented to explain what people didn't - and often, at the time, couldn't - understand.\\"<br /><br />A book like this is needed at a time when science is under attack, and I am very grateful to Professor Dawkins for writing this and I highly recommend this book as an introductory science book for any student of any age.e it means the model probably represents the truth, or at least a part of the truth.<br /><br />Sometimes the predictions don't come out right, and so scientists go back and adjust the model, or think up a new one and then go on to test that.

0670022950|1.0|I have read this book and found it as disappointing as I have found all previous books by Pinker.  Of all the reviews I have read of it, the best one which comes closest to my own views about Pinker can be found at the following link: This is quite a long, and strong, piece attacking Steven Pinker's latest book, but not quite as long as the book itself.  Pinker fans and proponents of evolutionary psychology will be dismayed, but it is a welcome antidote to all the bull we've been fed over the years about genetic determination of human behavior.  Well worth reading - a must read!<br />[...]
B006LSZECO|5.0|Decided to give this book a try after reading some good reviews. Was pleasantly surprised by how the author twisted what could have been a predictable story line. The first section had me hooked even though I thought I knew where the story was headed. Liked the different views of the story from both the husband and wife's perception. Started the second section and \\"pow\\", the story took a crazy turn. Could not put the book down and kept reading to see what was next. The final section was interesting. Not quite how I wanted the story to end but it kept me guessing right up to the last page.
B003QP4NPE|1.0|Recommended by a friend. Wouldn't mind reading it but why the hell does it cost more than the physical paperback version? Screw you penguin and your hatred of ebooks.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Totally awesome!! I have this app on my Kindle &amp; I-phone.  Love to make my own combinations to soothe away my stress.  Planning on upgrading it on both devices.  Hope I don't have to pay for it twice.
B007Y5IAV0|4.0|At first i wasnt impressed with this cd as it seems like darrin was really the one in the band with the musical mind.  But after a few listens u start to notice the subtile musical and harmony shifts that make this cd great.  In my opinion this is his best solo cd.  If u are not a serj fan this cd will not change that but if u are this cd is def ur cup of tea.  Its not heavy in the way of SOAD but songs like CHING CHIME def make this cd worth it. Switching from the eastern flute SOAD crazy sound to SERJ just kicking ass on the chorus is amazing.  Id say at times i would like to hear his voice come through more often on some songs but it is great on a few select songs.  The slower songs are not really slow as they are more melodic and electro.  And the addition of goth punk is a welcome surprise from him.  I def say this cd is a very good cd but i really miss SOAD and wish they could put a cd out.  If u are a straight up SOAD fan then buy the old SCARS ON BROADWAY cd.  That cd sounds exactly like a classic SOAD. Cd

0553582038|1.0|A Feast for Crows is a failure on many levels. This book acted only as a bridge between book 3 and book 5, and frankly its about as useless as building a bridge over a puddle. Now, I have only recently discovered GRRM, but I LOVED the first 2.5 books. Around halfway through book 3 my friend started giving me spoilers, and that's when I knew that the future of this series will not be as good as the beginning.<br /><br />First, this may the weirdest complaint ever penned, but I started to get annoyed with the chapter namings. Up til now, GRRM had titled each one simply, using just the name. Bran. Sansa. Tyrion. It was  easy, you knew what you were looking at, and you were fully prepared to deal with what lay ahead. Not so in this book. The first chapter I came to was with Aeron Greyjoy, or the Damphair. But it wasn't titled Aeron, or even Damphair. No no. It had some other title, some string of words that described who he was and what he had done in previous books (which isn't much). I may be a simpleton, but I'd much rather spend minutes reading and pondering the characters futures and actions than try to figure out WHO THE CHAPTER IS ABOUT. There have a good deal of chapters called \\"The Turncloak\\", and never once about the same person. Just call them by their names, and leave the complexity to the chapters, although there's enough of that already.<br /><br />Two, cut the uncertainty. Just tell us who actually is dead. Lady Catelyn came back to life, though she shouldn't have, and more on that later. Don't make it seem like something has happened, when in reality the person is alive. (Brienne, anyone?) For all we know, Joffrey is screaming his head off in the dungeons, brought back to life by some magician.<br /><br />Three, the characters. Oh my gosh, I hate most of these characters. Now, I don't have to like them all, Cersei is a good example despite the fact she's a well-written character, but come on! Stop introducing Victarion and Euron and half the Martells andArys Oakheart! Nobody cares! i'd much rather have Jaime's story advance than to read about new characters that most of us just wish would run into some rocks. With all the minor, useless characters, GRRM could have condensed books 4 and 5 into one, and then we'd be farther along in the story. But no. And Brienne is very annoying. Yes, we understand she's honorable! Yes, she swore an oath to Lady Catelyn. And yes, she's ugly. After being tol in EVERY chapter how honorable she is, I'd like something to happen to her, to sort of appease the suffering we as readers have to endure. Although Bran isn't featured in this book, thankfully, I really wish that he would die or something. Yes, he's 9 years old, but he is completely useless the grand scheme of things. Unless he manages to kill all the Others and everything past the wall, he is just taking up space in a book that doesn't need anymore POVs.<br /><br />And then there's the magic. If GRRM is so bent on using magic as sparsely as possible, why is Lady Catelyn alive? Why is she here? Using magic to bring her back was simply because GRRM could not let go of her as a character. Which is unfortunate, because she was so awful I hoped that Lady Lysa would throw her down the Moon Door. We would have been FINE without her there. She dies because she goes with Robb to that stupid wedding (why was he there anyway?), and it would have been out of character if she hadnt gone. Really, I could have gone on without her in the story. But she comes back, and is now this assassin, who, really, is utterly useless, and nobody knows why she's there. In short, her \\"new\\" character is completey contrived, and is a total deus ex machina.<br /><br />Finally, where is GRRM going with this?? Jaime is sent to Riverrun, to negotiate with some people. Cersei is bumbling about in King's Landing, mostly yelling at Tommen, plotting against Margaery, and seducing Ser Osney Ketteblack. Brienne LITERALLY wanders through the woods and makes stupid mistakes. Arya does nothing at all and could have been a great character. Seriously, if she's killed people, can't she sneak herself all the way to Winterfell and avoid being captured? She had so much potential! Anyway. The Greyjoys are useless and are yelling obscenities. The Martells are walking around quietly and capturing their daughters. They do NOTHING. I used to love this series. I think that with all the skill GRRM has displayed thus far, he really could wrap this up tightly in a way that makes sense. If you can creat hundreds of characters, you better be able to give them endings. And I hope that no more useless chracters are introduced, because frankly there are too many inconsequential ones already.<br /><br />On a very important side note, I hope that there won't be 5 years between book 5 and book 6. Because I'm not going to be reading this series in 2016, just because GRRM can't hurry it up. If J.K Rowling did it, with a complex plot and complex characters, then why is GRRM special? He's not, and he better hurry up and write. Its just not fair to all of us who can't wait to see what happens, if if books 4 and 5 were, at best, displays of mediocrity and a waste of time that could have been spent reading books that have an ending. I want this time spent to be worth it. And it will be, if by some miracle things start to come together.

0307887960|5.0|I was reluctant to try this diet out because it sounded too much like Atkins.  It really isn't though -- yes it is low carbs, but it is also lean protein and low fat.  Plus it gives you a great way to transition to eating this way for life -- which I really like. Since I'm approaching mid-40s I thought it would be a real struggle to start getting the lbs to come off but it wasn't ....  it just started coming off.  I have 10lbs to go to be at my goal and I couldn't be happier about it.<br /><br />My only \\"problem\\" with this approach is that I am not a creative cook so the food can get a bit boring but that is my fault.  A friend is doing it as well and comes up with all sorts of flavorful creative things to eat.<br /><br />Highly recommend it.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|Many people I know were reading this and talking about it so I decided to give it a try.  I liked the book, thought it was interesting (I want to know what makes Christian tick) and it's also an insight as to what is acceptable to some people. I just purchased book two of the series.
0345803485|5.0|For the last half hour I've been reeding these reviews for this book, and I have been laughing my but off! The book seems horrible so I won't be reading it ( thank god for reviews) I almost got my self sucked in to the black hole of page turning redundant lip biting! ( sigh) thank you all for writing such awesome, witty, and funny reviews! They were very entertaining. I would keep reading them but I'm already sick of this book.
0385512058|5.0|One of the best books that I've ever came across and if one could implement the ideas that Keith Ferrazzi is taking about - you got it. I always enjoy reading and re-reading this book. Of course, there are some points that I would disagree with, but as general, big picture - it is an excellent direction to take.
B0034KZE9U|4.0|I work in the food service industry and have searched high and low for a comfortable non-slip shoe that my restaurant would approve.  After trying several different pairs of work shoes from different manufacturers and being disappointed with each one, I had almost given up.  As it was, I had spent $25-$68 per pair, with each one being more expensive than the last.  Then one day I was wearing an old pair of Crocs around the house and suddenly wondered if they made food industry grade shoes.  After a quick search online, I found these for less than $30.  This is the first time that I can work a full shift and have NO foot or leg pain.  I am so grateful.  And after working in them for 8-9 hours at a time for the past month, they are holding together perfectly.<br /><br />The only negative I have found is that the non-slip bottoms do not provide as much traction on wet surfaces as some of my other shoes.  So I do have to be a bit more careful.  Small price to pay for painless nights!<br /><br />Note: They do not come in half-sizes, so they suggest you order the lower end of your half-size.  I did this and they can be a bit snug at first, but within a few minutes of walking, they warm up and stretch.  No problems.

B000002JOH|5.0|First off Im a black man... not that it means anything but you'll see why i started with that as u read.... i pride myself in the fact that i listen to alot of different music. i do gospel, rap, jazz, classical, R & B.  But i could never get a rock/metal group that i could get into. i was used to the 80's and 90's rock like Bon Jovi, Def Leppard, Queen and other older groups. Then somehow recently someone put me on to Marilyn Manson and i thought, upon listening to it was crazy and i searched for more. So i started listening to Korn, Drowning Pool, and i even tried The Perfect Circle but i couldnt find that one album that made me say wow. So Im in this deli and im listening to this guys radio and I heard \\"Walk\\" and i was hooked. I went and downloaded (legaly from amazon) some of there songs (Walk, I'm Broken, Piss). But then the songs from this album Vulgar Display of Power stood out so much that i had to buy the album.  I know I'm new to this but track for track this album is nuts!!!! Crazy gitar, some beats that alot of rappers need to sample especailly \\"I'm broken\\")  To me its just a great album. And the fact that people only gave it one to two or even three stars need to be drug tested...<br /><br />The funniest part about listening to Patera and other heavy metal songs is the reaction i get where i live. I have to be the only blackman in queen blasting Patera... I pull up at a light and the people next to me roll there windows up... LOL (funny shit)... My wife knows when I'm home from work because its hitting so hard... Great Sh*t!!!!
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|This review is mainly based on the quality of the blu-ray, because if you're thinkin of buying it you probabaly already know that it's a very good movie.  It's one of the best superhero movies to date (depending on whether or not you like the recent Marvel movies more).  The blu-ray looks really good.  In the scene in the interrogation room with Batman and the Joker I felt I was in the room with them haha.  What makes this blu-ray a must have if that not only is it great looking, but it also presents the IMAX scenes throughout the movie seemlessly.  If you're thinking of getting this blu-ray, get it.
0345803485|1.0|I join the other 3,086 one star reviews. No other popular book ever made Stephanie Meyers appear to be as good as JK Rowling, like this book has. It seems that this is what some people want. I hope the reason that it has been on the bestsellers list for such a long time, is just because of morbid curiosity<br />This book makes twilight look very well written. If she forces sex scenes everywhere, at least she can write it artistically. Everything is done so tastelessly. It seems like a rushed thing. Not surprised that its a twilight spin-off.<br />Every other line the character is holy this and holy that. Then she she is like talking in too proper english throwing curses in between. What character consistency!<br />Dont understand the fascination at all. Where has good literature gone?
0307744434|1.0|I read a lot ....and this book is horrible.....  Trying to get through it and I am not sure how anyone has given this book any good reviews......  Are we reading the same book?  Don't waste your money......its a nightmare, not a dream.
B0034KZE9U|5.0|I had back surgery a four years back, and have been pain free through a combination of yoga, core strengthening exercises and barefoot-style footwear. I was nervous when I faced culinary school because I'd be on my feet for so many hours. These crocs allow me to spread my toes, run (if necessary) across a slippery floor to turn off a boiling pot, protect from falling knives, and even though every part of me aches from the workout school provides, after a long day my back is fine.<br /><br />If you are used to a lot of sneaker-style support you may take a week to adjust to them (bring an extra pair to switch to school/work) but after you get your muscles in shape, you'll never want anything else. The reviewer who \\"heard\\" crocs are bad for your back should provide some sources. Unless you have unusually high arches or unusually flat feet, shoes that provide less support are actually better for you. Do some searches on \\"barefoot running\\" and \\"Stanford head coach Vin Lananna\\" or check out the book [[ASIN:0307279189 Born to Run: A Hidden Tribe, Superathletes, and the Greatest Race the World Has Never Seen]] ... less is more and crocs give you just enough to stay safe in the kitchen, and no more than that.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Let me start by saying that I am a minimalist. I hardly ever have a protector on my devices, especially my cell phones. With that in mind I was looking for a case that would not add a lot of bulk or detract from the sleek look of the Kindle Fire. This case does both. The case is very sturdy. I have dropped the Fire twice while it was in the case with no damage whatsoever to the case or device. The strap and flexible material makes it easy to use the stand feature, and I have not noticed it wearing out like some other reviewers. Yes it is plastic, but no it is not \\"cheap\\". Very good product for the money.
B007Z9RAX4|5.0|What to say about this movie.  I give it 5 stars as this movie is well written and I really enjoyed it to the end.  I recommend watching it at least once.

B007ZZKWHY|5.0|Yeah sure, you have to ignore the fact that they can get to the moon and survive back in the 40's... but after that this is a really good movie.  The blu-ray works, but no bonus features do (wish they'd stop that) Anyhow, the plot of having this race of Nazis on the moon thriving and harvesting this high-power fuel, but using steampunk technology to use it is soooo cool.  though their computer technology is severely lacking to power their main vessel.  They capture an american sent to the moon on a routine check of the mineral fuel resources of the moon and find that his cellphone can power their ship but it drains the battery almost instantly!  So a single ship is sent down to try gain more of these \\"super computers\\" and learn of what Earth is like now before the main fleet is sent - some believing in a peaceful reunion, but the military heads wanting conquest and revenge.  The movie turns out to be more than just a fun B movie... spoofing government in general and showing that even labels like American and Nazi don't always automatically mean Good and Bad.  How people with power can go too far for greed masked as patriotism.
B008B3H4VQ|2.0|The album is just meh.... I saw Linkin Park when they had their very first concert at the launch of Hybrid Theory. What I don't understand about bands is they have a working formula that works and they change it and lose a majority of their fan base. This is why their albums are 3 and 4 dollars at launch now. The songs are OK if you are into the person who likes to \\"sing in the shower\\" too much through the song. Yeah chester can belt some lyrics but ultimately the past couple albums dont shed light on hybrid theory or meteora. If your fans of that Linkin Park just save your money.
B0074V3712|4.0|Wilson is one of the world's leading biologists, unquestionably brilliant.  His writing is lucid and stylish, and the content is certainly eye-opening.  However the book is repetitive, considerably longer than need be.  The thesis is rather narrow:  group selection explains just about everything.  I found a recent Scientific American article by Wilson's collaborator Nowak to be much broader and even more eye-opening.

B000002WAD|5.0|As far as I myself am concerned Rick Astley was a happy musical part of my growing up that greatly influenced the soul,funk and R&B music I was already deeply involved listening to. Almost emmediatly I was very impressed with the freckle faced young red head with the booming baritone. Looking back? His persona was someone like somewhat more earnest Michael McDonald and a less sexually charged George Michael. Sadly as time went on Rick himself would become the poster child for \\"antieightiesitis\\" as I call it,used as a human punching bag for critics of the decade. In recent years that developed into the online gag of \\"Rick rolling\\" that's also had the effect of riviving interest in Astley himself. But what all started it? What other then this man's best known hit really made him so penetrating?<br /><br />  Turns out there's a lot to merrit this. The first three songs are an almost hit parade with \\"Never Gonna Give You Up\\" starting it,the similarly themed title song in between and \\"Together Forever\\" as the third. These songs are all very well constructed late 80's dance-pop with some wonderfully composed and performed vocal refrains. \\"It Would Take A Strong Man\\" basically brings out more of the gospel soul influences of his sound. Rick himself also gets a chance to show himself as a more than capable songwriter on the shuffling Brit funky soul of \\"Slipping Away\\" (another highlight of this album to me outside the mildly poppier first three songs) and the somewhat deeper and funkier grooves \\"No More Looking For Love\\" and \\"You Move Me\\". He ends the album on a well sung interpretation of \\"When I Fall In Love\\".<br /><br />  Overall this album presents the Stock Aitken Waterman production team at the top of their game,producing music that quite contrary to critical rhetoric is far from bland and generic in this particular case. That's because of Rick himself. He's a very participatory artist here,writing songs and even playing guitar on the songs he wrote. A lot of these songs,even the big hits have a pretty heavy bottom for a lot of dance-pop music of the time. That's because most dance-pop of this period was usually inspired by some variation of synthesized new wave and/or disco. That is with dance-pop being another word for disco music half the time anyway. And even with the big hits being very 70's disco/dance inspired Rick's main influences are very obviously soul,funk and R&B. And even on the poppiest melody here that aspect of his talent manages to shine through.ngs,even the big hits have a pretty heavy bottom for a lot of dance-pop music of the time.

B00122FYMO|5.0|I am not much of a Madonna fan, but this album was an instant urban and international classic from her groovin' debut single \\"Everybody\\" to the rockin' hit dance track, \\"Lucky Star.\\"  It was no surprise that when Madonna first came into the music scene in 1982, radio listeners assumed that she was an African American artist because the sound and lyrics to \\"Everybody\\" was much more of an R&B flavored song (Madonna's picture never appeared of the single of the album cover).  When the videos for \\"Everybody\\" and \\"Burnin' Up\\" were released in late 1982-early 1983, the misconception was cleared and viewers were stunned to see the soulful and sassy voice were behind a white girl from Michigan (note that these singles were released before the album hit the stores in the fall of 1983).  Reggie Lucas produced most of the album and this album proved that Reggie had a knack for producing dance/pop flavored songs (with some soul) of which was completely different from the funky music he recorded and produced with Mtume (known for the 1983 R&B hit single, \\"Juicy Fruit\\").  Her third single, \\"Holiday\\" solidifed her pop success and turned out to be one of her signature songs, but it was'nt until the release or \\"Lucky Star\\" and \\"Borderline\\" that rose to the top 10 on the pop charts and became MTV favorites, thus establishing her as an icon to the two year old (formally struggling) station.  These singles established that her fame was not limited to dance and club success.  It was a shock that \\"Holiday\\" was never release as a video, despite of its success, but it was said that the music video for \\"Borderline\\" was the first video by a white female artist that was played on BET (of which previously exclusively played videos by black artists with the exception of Hall & Oates).  In this video, Madonna broke the taboo of interracial relationships (of which was rare in music videos at the time). Although at first it seems that Madonna denies the Hispanic guy (street dancer) in favour of the photographer, later she rejects him thus implying her desire to control her own sexual pleasures.  I believe that the potrayal of herself in a Hispanic community was a clever marketing strategy to appeal to blacks, whites, and latinos and thats probaly why the music video was a favorite on both MTV and BET alike.  \\"Physical Attraction\\" was a energetic funk dance track that was much to the style of Prince.  Like Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller,\\" Madonna's debut was well received internationally with different blends of pop, rock, dance, and R&B.  If I had to pick a Madonna album, this would be my favorite one.

B000IMMR1U|5.0|Everyone can remember the first song that made them love music. Mine was \\"I Would  Die for You\\". I was 4 when \\"Purple Rain\\" hit the big screen, and I was hooked when my mother played the record for Saturday morning chores. I wanted the album on vinyl as a momento for the artist I love, and the soundtrack that made me fall in love with music.<br /><br />I'm so excited that they had the album on vinyl and it is in excellent condition.
B007UYZDZ6|5.0|I wish that the last episode would have been done differently or that it was just skipped entirely. Castle does what I'd imagine he'd have done in the first place, find a new Muse. In this episode Castle realizes that he has been taking his involvement with Beckett for granite when his new partner puts him in spots he thought he always wanted to be in only to find out it really sucks. This is a great episode that looks deeper into the character development and whats really going on between Castle and the rest of the crew.
B00005N6KG|5.0|My very first walkman I bought in 1986 had vertical in-the-ear headphones which was the mainstream type at that time. When they were totally worn out and broken, these type of headphones virtually had disappeared in favor of the one-size-fits-none ear-plug type headphones. Since then I have owned many more headphones of various types which all disappointed in one way or another.<br /><br />Since I started running again I needed some good sports headphones. When I went thru all the other headphones I had collected over the years I purchased a Sennheiser Very Expensive Very Durable Sweat Waterproof Sports Headphone. Which developed wire breakage in several places and fell literally apart from oxidation.<br /><br />Then I saw this one. Ultra-light and vertical-in-the-ear. This is a truly wonderful headphone! It is light as a feather, so it can't bounce while running. The cord is light as well so it doesn't shake. I put my headband over the ultra-thin bracket, so the headphone doesn't move a tenth of an inch. Sound is more than adequate, and the headphone is very sensitive, more than others, so there is plenty headroom left in you volume control. I wouldn't classify the sound as hifi, the treble is a bit too low for that. But the sound is very pleasant, undistorted, not harsh and a good amount of deep bass.<br /><br />After a week I can't say anything about durability, but for $8 I am happy to consider the  headphone as consumable and replace it every two months. Too bad Amazon restricted the number to be purchased to 3. I am going to order a couple more soon.<br /><br />Finally, good designs have come back.<br /><br />jlinkels<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />I am using these headphones for 5 months now. Running 2 times a week on average. I sweat heavily because of the high temperatures. They are still like new. Incredible price/performance ratio. I fear they are taken off the market soon because they are simply too good to be true.
B007R1HX3M|3.0|I really enjoy this series but the circles are getting a little old. To think that Castle and Beckett have been working side-by-side for four years and they haven't gotten together or parted ways seems a bit far fetched to me. The fact that Castle is still working with Beckett also doesn't make any sense, the episode before this he stated the reason he would go back was because he wanted to do it for the people, he was seeking a type of closure to the case which is understandable. The part I have a hard time believing is he still shows up even though he believes Kate doesn't like him. Also, he has no reason to be there because he has stated in the past the Kate is capable of doing her job and she is an exceptional detective, and he is not the only one who states this, even 'Iron Gates' said this to Kate. So what is the purpose of Castle still showing up? He doesn't need any more 'research' for his books, he is somewhat of an asset to the investigations but they've done fine before he got there and would do fine after he left.<br /><br />To make matters worse, Castle is basically throwing a temper tantrum, which given a stretch I can see Castle doing this, but why would Beckett or Gates put up with his little antics. After the last episode I had a hard time even thinking about watching this one, and it was somewhat of a difficult episode to watch because there seems to be so many lose strings and missing reasons why people are doing what they are doing.
B000FBJF3M|5.0|Pompeii is impossible to put down and represents historical writing at its best. I finished it in two days, and everyone I've passed it to has loved it. Harris's characters are real and intriguing, and though he's setting is in ancient Rome, I found I was able to relate to the characters, such as the steadfast public servant facing complaints about water shortages and the greedy real estate speculator. He really brings things to life.<br /><br />The other books rounding out my top three history novels are [[ASIN:B008E1P7KA God King of Angkor: A Novel of Tyranny]], which is set in ancient Cambodia, and [[ASIN:0312429983 Wolf Hall: A Novel]], which is set in Tudor England.

B004M8S3Y6|5.0|Timothy Ferriss' book is the first nutrition and exercise book I've read that appealed to me from start to finish, and the first book able to motivate me into trying to do what it suggested.<br /><br />The first week after I started following Tim's 5 rules I lost 2.3kg. The second week, 1.3kg. The third, 2.6kg. After the fourth week (my first month), I had lost a total of just under 10kgs (from 97.9kg to 88.4kg).<br /><br />Alongside the weight loss I gained 5% muscle mass, I kicked my 15-cup a day coffee habit (I'm down to one or to espressos), and I have a seemingly never-ending fountain of energy to push me through my days.<br /><br />For me the changes proposed by this book don't define a diet, they define a lifestyle. A lifestyle that I intend to adhere to permanently.

B007VTVGAQ|5.0|I'm a HUGE fiona apple fan, but I am not reviewing this in a biased way (at least that's what i think).<br />Honestly, I am afraid to pick up the album, because I am scared that I might not like it even being considered as \\"universally acclaimed\\" in the metacritic site.<br />The album is fresh, it is very similar to the ballads available in the extraordinary machine album.  The music seems raw (in a good way) with rough vocals that tend to melt like butter when she feels vulnerable.  I will give this a 4.5-5/5 stars but not a solid 5 basing on the \\"when the pawn...\\" album. Over-all i can't say that this is a must listen to album; it is great! but it is not for everybody.

B004LWZWGA|5.0|I read the reviews for \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" saying there were a lot of plot holes and I wasn't expecting much, I should know better, I thought the \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" was the best Batman movie, period.<br /><br />Christian Bale back as Bruce Wayne/Batman, who has been a recluse for eight years because Batman is wanted for the murder of Harvey Dent and Bruce Wayne is mourning the death of Rachael Dawes, his only companion and confidant Alfred, once again portrayed by Michael Caine, who has been urging Bruce to get back into life and move on, Bruce can't. While Lucius Fox played by Morgan Freeman tries to lure Bruce back to Batman by showing him some cool new weapons, including one called \\"The Bat.\\"<br /><br />During a fundraiser at Wayne Manor, Bruce is staying in his private quarters and discovers a cat burglar, Anne Hathaway, the first catwoman (although she's never called that in the movie) that has some real claws, stealing his mother's pearl necklace, but taking an acrobatic leap out of a window, evades the hobbled Bruce Wayne.<br /><br />And emerging from the sewers of Gotham is Bane, a muscle bound mercenary bent on the destruction of Gotham city by nuclear bomb, he cuts off Gotham from the mainland by blowing the bridges and instituting a sort of French Revolution cum \\"Escape From New York\\" scenario.<br /><br />One of the most frequently mentioned drawbacks of \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" is that Batman doesn't make an appearance in the film until 45 minutes into the film, but in that time the story, the plot and characters are being developed so Batman's physical presence doesn't leave a hole in the film or a sense of emptiness at his absence until he appears, as we know he will. The other plot holes are minor and while you may notice one it is soon overwhelmed by the story and the progress it makes.<br /><br />Director and writer Christopher Nolan (along with brother Jonathon Nolan) wrote an elegantly plotted thriller that has eliminated some of the clunkiness of \\"Batman Begins\\" and \\"The Dark Knight\\" that has enough misdirection in it to keep viewers guessing as to what will happen next and who the real villain is. It's obvious the Nolan's were bringing their Dark Knight saga full circle, there are references and cameos to the other two movies including one by Liam Neeson that almost detracts from the film because it almost seems like he's a force ghost from \\"Star Wars.\\" \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" is a violent movie but it also has some real emotional depth at the end brought to you by Michael Caine's Alfred.iness of \\"Batman Begins\\" and \\"The Dark Knight\\" that has enough misdirection in it to keep viewers guessing as to what will happen next and who the real villain is.

0060734191|5.0|This is yet another fabulous YA fantasy trilogy (I'm catching up on my reviews today!). The world development is detailed and fascinating, the heroines are well-drawn and sympathetic characters, and the premise is one of the most original I've ever read. Nix creates a complex mythology of necromancers, charter magic and spirit binding, where those who deal with the dead, and even Death itself, are not always the bad guys.<br /><br />There are faults. While Nix' heroines are engaging, complex and vivid (especially Lirael, introduced in the second volume), some the supporting human cast is not as consistently well developed - one or two in particular are almost caricatures. Mogget, the spirit usually in the form of a cat, and Lirael's Disreputable Dog, however, provide both depth of character and the additional spice of comic relief.  Here and there, too, I felt the writing -- how should I put it? -- lose its usual sense of immediacy; there were places where I felt disconnected from the action, or the characters, perhaps. These lapses were few and brief, however.<br /><br />The protagonist of the first book, Sabriel, is a strong character, who elicits a great deal of sympathy in her quest to bring her father back into Life (note; for the Abhorsen, this has a slightly different meaning than \\"back to life\\"). For sheer depth and complexity, however, I think Nix really hits his stride with Lirael. We meet her as an adolescent: withdrawn, introspective, somewhat self-absorbed at times, with a complex inner life. Her hopes and disappointments almost take on a life of their own with all the melodrama and fervor a teenager can muster. I found her journey on the road to maturity, from her violent reaction to crushed childhood dreams to her reluctant acceptance of the unique role she must play in her strange world, very real, touching, and occasional reminiscent of my own growing up as an introverted and socially awkward girl.
1439181780|5.0|Similar in design and in feel to The Secret, Byrne once again delivers a powerful book with just the right amount of memorable quotes and input from other growth experts.<br /><br />Where the secret covered the Law of Attraction, The Power does as well with the addition of the power of love.<br /><br />She still discusses the same principles (a great review if you read The Secret), i.e. your thoughts and feelings draw like things to you in the physical world. She adds the importance of feeling and thinking thoughts of love to empower yourself to manifest your outcome in your life.<br /><br />She says it plainly, \\"Your thoughts and words have no power at all in your life without your feelings.\\" The most powerful feeling of all is love, so if you love more and direct that love with thoughts and words you become a stronger magnet for one thing, more love into your life. Don't just say the words, believe you have received what you ask for (Jesus), and you will have it. The question to ask is, do you want more love or not?
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Sparks wrote another excellent novel that was enjoyable to read. The storyline flowed well and had elements of suspense as the reader wonderd what was next. The ending was written perfectly. I was in shock and saddened, but the epilogue concluded the book wonderfully.
1451673442|5.0|Whether you love the Law of Attraction or are new to it; you will find all you need to know in The Magic.<br /><br />The Secret was about the Law of Attraction given in detail, i.e. thoughts become things, what we have intense focus and emotion directed towards comes to pass.<br /><br />As Byrne makes clear, without emotion and feeling, words don't accomplish anything. It is the power of emotions that makes you a magnet.<br /><br />In The Power Byrne talks about the power of love, the strongest feeling in the universe. Feel love and you attract love, feel love and direct that emotion with a vision of your goal being attained and you reach your goal quicker because you are so emotionally charged.<br /><br />In The Magic Byrne talks about the power of gratitude, being thankful daily. The opposite of love is NOT hate, but fear. To destroy fear have gratitude, there is no faster way to eliminate if from your life. Anthony Robbins has discussed this principle as well. Gratitude eliminates fear. So if you FEEL gratitude and direct that emotion to say getting a promotion, you will draw the promotion because you have strong energy because of a powerful emotion.<br /><br />Try this, every day simply say for 5 minutes, \\"I am so grateful for...\\" As you begin this you will feel different, i.e. feel gratitude. Bryne is right in The Magic, gratitude will eliminate fear and depression. Be grateful for what? Anything that comes to mind, family, friends, air conditioning, a puppy, a flower, clean water, the thousands of people who had a hand in building your car, the fact that you can read, for your pancreas, it doesn't matter, just over and over say, \\"I am grateful for, I am grateful for.\\" You will feel the energy inside (your aura is expanding) and you will become a more powerful magnet for attracting your dreams. Thank you Rhonda Byrne for another book from your heart!
0553386794|1.0|I had high hopes for this series due to the rave reviews it's received, but I was very disappointed.  I'm not sure when page upon page of rape, murder, prostitution, incest, pedophilia, and foul language became \\"deep and thought provoking\\" but Tolkien seemed to tell a very similar story without all of that.  So have many MANY other fantasy authors.  It's sad that this has become what people today consider a great work of fiction.. I guess this is evidenced by the fact that 50 Shades of Gray is an international best seller.<br /><br />I could have stomached the childish motif that Martin used to deliver his plot (only children are impressed by \\"forbidden\\" topics and think it equates to maturity) except for the fact that his characters are ridiculous.  It would appear that in Martin's world, the \\"good\\" guys are incompetent and the \\"bad\\" guys are the only ones who succeed.  This is a very common depiction of good vs evil, but his \\"good\\" guys don't even stay in character.  The only ones who remain true to themselves are the bad guys. I honestly reached the point by the 3rd book (and yes I gave this series 3 chances to redeem itself), that I was ROOTING for the \\"bad\\" guys to win and for the \\"good\\" guys to die and just end the series already. That, I can honestly say, is a first for me in any series I have ever read.  So props to Martin for that one :)
0345803485|3.0|This is not my idea of a book club selection.  I am not a fan of this type of writing, and could not in good faith recommend this book.  I did not really enjoy it at all, only read it because it was a book club selection.
B001FB55HQ|5.0|I just don't get the negative reviews. I refused to watch it because of the many bad reviews. I finally decided to watch it last night. I was expecting a lousy flick. What a pleasant surprise. This movie is great. Almost as good as the first Terminator but definately better than parts two and three. If you don't like this movie you just can't appreciate originality and great action. 10 STARS OUT OF 10!
1401324029|4.0|I really enjoyed  this sequel to [[ASIN:0786891416 Heat Wave, (Nikki Heat, Book 1)]]. I thought it picked up Nikki's story nicely, although I was kind of confused at the beginning about why Nikki and Jameson broke up and had such a bad break-up. But, it kind of gets explained later on. I liked that they work together again though, despite the awkardness. Especially since Jameson is closely linked with the case.<br /><br />The story was very interesting, and the reveal of who the actual murderer was/who started this mess was done very well. When I thought I had figured it out, Castle throws another wrench into the bucket. Plus, the idea of a gossip columnist being the investigated murder and then being linked to so many other things is something that seems like it really could happen. Stars need to protect their images sometimes, and the people around them will often go to great lengths to help them.<br /><br />While the plot doesn't really follow the plot of the TV show, I think that the relationship between Nikki and Jameson closely parallels that of Kate Beckett and Richard Castle. Not with the awkward break-up or anything, but the playful banter, how Jameson annoys Nikki, etc. It's really interesting to pick out which characters are who, and to see how close they are to the characters in the TV show.<br /><br />The pacing wasn't too bad, but there were a couple of sections where it seemed things were dragging or going into way too much detail. But, I did like all of the different ways that Nikki could have been considered to be \\"naked,\\" and I thought the title was very appropriate for the novel. All said and done though, I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has already read Heat Wave, and I would recommend the series to fans of the TV show Castle or murder mystery novels (or both!). I give Naked Heat a 4/5.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|good fun app. but I don't know why I have to rate it 5 stars to play the next level. kind of messes up the ratings.
B000U7169M|1.0|Some kid dies mysteriously, then some odd events start occuring that are very similar to the biblical plagues. Katherine (Hilary Swank, \\"Million Dollar Baby\\") comes to the town of Haven where these events are taking place (quite a bit of irony with that), this town is deep in the Louisiana bayou so naturally the locals don't like outsiders like Katherine coming to their little town. They're especially upset since Katherine is here to debunk these events as anything but religious based, she does find a young girl (AnnaSophia Robb, \\"Race to Witch Mountain\\") who may be the key to either solving or be the cause of these things happening.<br /><br />This might've been a very campy yet suspenseful movie, if oh say there was any scares or chills to be found anywhere in the entire running time. Swank at least does well in her roll as she's truly a bright spot in this dull flick, AnnaSophia isn't given too much more to do but look scared and well that's about it, which is sad cause she's actually a decent actress. Sadly the events or plagues that take place while somewhat visually impressive feel quite hollow and just blah.<br /><br />I've seen worse movies that's for sure, but \\"The Reaping\\" is not something to rush or even walk out to rent and watch. * out of 4 stars.
B004UJAOLM|2.0|I am still trying to read this book. I have no idea what is going on. Not an interesting book to me.
B000M341QE|5.0|Taking place in Boston we have two cops undercover but on opposite sides of the law shall we say, however both are attempting to stop the Irish-American crime wave sweeping the state. One man is a cop named Billy (Leonardo DiCaprio, \\"Inception\\") who gains the trust of a high ranking mob boss, the other is a man called Colin (Matt Damon, \\"Hereafter\\") working for the mob syndicate that has gotten into a nice position in the police's Special Investigation Squad. As both try to do their best to maintain their double lives it becomes clear one of them must either break their cover or die.<br /><br />What sounds like a basic everyday cop drama, is elevated to Academy Award status thanks to great performances by DiCaprio, Damon, Jack Nicholson (\\"As Good As It Gets\\") the mob boss, Mark Wahlberg (\\"Shooter\\"), Vera Farmiga (\\"Orphan\\") as a woman both Damon and DiCaprio fall for and many other supporting players.<br /><br />Also having Martin Scorsese (\\"Shutter Island\\") as your director really adds some nice punch and spice to this movie, as there aren't many directors who could handle this big of a cast and handle it as well as he does. The story is also very layered, plenty of stuff going on with some good side stories. The best performances to me were DiCaprio as I feel this was his major breakout role, Damon was great as well and Wahlberg was fantastic especially in the closing scenes.<br /><br />Its quite possibly as close to a perfect cop drama as you'll get, just great from start to finish. **** out of 4 stars.
B007VTVGAQ|5.0|I was very disappointed when I first heard this CD about 5 weeks ago.  I figured this was just not for me.  I didn't like the stripped down sound, and I thought the percussion was not well arranged.  I found it unnerving and I thought that if Fiona Apple wanted to record a CD with a more stripped down sound, she should have just accompanied herself on piano.<br /><br />Since I am a big fan of Fiona's first three albums, \\"Tidal,\\" \\"When The Pawn...,\\" and \\"Extraordinary Machine,\\" I just kept listening.  What changed my mind about this album is Fiona's vocals.  She's developed this rough howl and knows exactly where to use it.  Just listen to the tracks \\"Werewolf\\" and \\"Regret.\\"  After a while the percussion arrangements started to make sense to me and I was able to focus on the lyrics which are brilliant.<br /><br />Now five weeks later, I think this is one of the best CD's I have heard in years.  Now, everything is perfect.  Fiona has remained a real alternative artist and has amazingly managed to sell a respectable amount of CD's at the same time.  \\"The Idler Wheel,\\" debuted on the Billboard 200 CD chart at number 3 and is now in its 5th week in the top 40.  It's also her fourth consecutive Billboard Top 10 CD.<br /><br />\\"The Idler Wheel\\" is even more of a Jazz album than her three previous albums, so Jazz fans - please run out and buy this.  I also highly recommend this to people who prefer other genres, but enjoy hearing something different sometimes.<br /><br />So listen, be patient, give it some time to sink in, and I promise you will become addicted.<br /><br />Fiona's first 3 CD's:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001J9EHSC Tidal]]  [[ASIN:B00138H5PQ When The Pawn...]]  [[ASIN:B00138KO6S Extraordinary Machine]]
B0059XTUEK|5.0|I am thrilled of this 'My Week with Marilyn' Blu-ray and DVD combo to be less than $20. I immediately purchased it because the film is excellent. This product offers great DVD quality. I have not tried the Blu-ray yet.

B004LP3AYI|1.0|I own both book and ebook. However, due to a disability I can no longer hold those thick books for very long so I bought the kindle version; after finding out it was supposed to have been \\"revised\\" in June. But the FINE Group didn't go far enough on the \\"revisions.\\" What a waste of money.<br /><br />I love the series! However, buy the book not the kindle version of Stone of Tears period!<br /><br />According to FINE group: The ebook was corrected on June 2012.<br /><br />=======================================================================================<br />Stone of Tears (The Sword of Truth #2) (Terry Goodkind)<br />- Highlight Loc. 36-37    Added on Sunday, July 29, 2012, 01:48 AM<br /><br />\\"First electronic edition published 2011 FINE Group. Corrected and revised June 2012.\\"<br />=======================================================================================<br /><br />The only thing I see that was changed was the major snafu of having the last chapter showing up after the end of the book.<br /><br />I have seen better editing from self-published authors than Stone of Tears ebook.<br /><br />It seems like the \\"publisher\\" did a classic Find / Replace All when it came to places where \\"than that\\"  or even \\"than\\" should up as \\"that that\\" or \\"that\\" instead of than. With the number of mistakes made in the book I wonder if someone retyped everything, for what ever reason, but I got that feeling on several occasions.<br /><br />Get it in gear FINE Group. I paid money for this crap! You have ruined an authors work. I sure hope his lawyers find a way of taking some of your hide off.
B0086700CM|4.0|when I first got it It was awesome but sometimes its hard to get the angel wings<br />besides that this game is cool! !!!!!!!!!!!!!'!!
0345803485|1.0|As many other readers have said, this is probably one of the most horrendous writers I have ever seen published. Can someone tell me how this drivel ever got published in the first place? I cannot finish it and I won't even bother to try. Iam almost embarrassed for this writer and I cringe each and every time I read \\"Oh my\\", \\"Oh crap\\", \\"Er...\\" or \\"Aargh!\\"  Aargh?! Who says that??!! Pirates?? I think this woman wrote this when she was about 16 and knew somebody in the business who talked someone or bribed someone into publishing it. The saddest part is that E L James is laughing all the way to the bank. Aargh!!!!
B0070NSPCU|4.0|A really solid read at an even better price. I tend to be a little wary of the  self published titles (Even well reviwed ones) because there is a lot of chaff mixed in with the good. Suffice it to say this one is not chaff.<br /><br />Likable characters, a highly engaging/exciting plot, this book can definitely stand among almost any of the recent \\"pro\\" fantasy writers' works.<br /><br />As others have said there is the occasional area that needs some editing work, but the story was too good to let that be a distraction.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is a very fun and addicting game that st times forces you to think outside of the box. hours and hours of game time too. even though its free I would totally pay for it!
B007SYWFRM|3.0|Cute, fun game for kids and adults.  Becomes impossible to get enough acorns to complete the goals without spending real money though.  Wish there was an option to buy acorns with coins instead.  I've encountered the same bugs as lots of other people too... game freezing and not being able to get credit for liking a friend's village.  Overall, just ok.
B007MU85D0|5.0|Very cohesive album. All the songs have a similar style without being overly repetitive.  I would recommend this album.  Great band!
B007KDFWRG|5.0|Wonderful arrangements of songs that you have heard before but never quite like this! I especially love \\"Wade in the Water\\". It is an awesome blend of great vocals and musicianship.
0307341550|3.0|Gillian Flynn's debut novel \\"Sharp Objects\\" explores the curious and arguably horrifying upbringing of Camille Preaker, a Chicago reporter whose assignment leads her back to her hometown. If you don't read seriously into this book, surprises await you in nearly every chapter, but if you've read other modern \\"thrillers,\\" you are almost expecting the ending. Don't get me wrong: Gillian Flynn is a good author. At times this story -- as well as her other books -- do touch on thrilling and riveting, but about halfway through you begin to form hypotheses about the ending that will most likely prove true. Without completely discounting Flynn as a great modern author, I have to wonder if she focused too much on heightening the reader's anticipation and failed to consider the story's resolution until much later.<br /><br />Regardless, it's possible that you will like this book. If you are still riding high on the exhilaration \\"Gone Girl\\" brings, I predict you will be slightly disappointed by what Flynn offers in this book. Bottom line: I went in expecting an exciting \\"plot twist,\\" but came out disappointed.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I love this game! I got It because I love Perry Carl and major monogram! My favorite part was the little clip at the end of the fall of major. monogram!
1451648537|5.0|I'll admit that I am not much of a non-fiction sort. In fact, one of my laments reading this was knowing that not an ounce of hope would keep the main character of this story alive. In spite of that, I did thoroughly enjoy Walter Isaacson's portrait of Steve Jobs immensely.<br /><br />As a Computing Software and Systems major at my local university, I felt it was about time for me to pick up this novel and learn about a man who made variable waves in the tech world. Admittedly, I've had relatively little knowledge of Jobs before these last few years. While I have had a number of iPods, and even a recently obtained iPad, I have never heard much about the creative geniuses behind the products.<br /><br />That's why I read this.<br /><br />Over a period of a month, I have slowly become immersed in the world that Steve Jobs, along with others, created. If I even remotely see an article pop up on my radar about Jobs, or Apple, or Open versus Closed products, I quickly bury my nose in a brand new set of text (like the Wired August 2012 issue sitting open on my bed as I write this).<br /><br />I'd want to say I haven't been blindsided by his reality distortion field, but given how many times Isaacson lets the narrative speak fully for Jobs, maybe I have.<br /><br />I am, however, not completely blinded by the man. While I acknowledge and am compelled by his artistic genius, I also see that Jobs was human and had flaws just like the rest of us. He is one of my personal role models now, but only in the manner I choose. And some of his behaviors were too atrocious for me to ever model myself after. As the examples have been detailed in various places, I won't go into them here.<br /><br />Suffice it to say, I thoroughly enjoyed Steve Jobs' biography. I love to learn--especially in regards to subjects that interest me--and this novel has been a treat for so many reasons. Isaacson's writing is compelling.<br /><br />Now all I need is a Bill Gates biography.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I really only bought this because of all the hype. Something I never do. But I did, and I really tried to like it. The writing is almost child-like and the dialogue is so stiff that it doesn't allow the reader to ever get into the main character, or any of the other ones either. A couple of chapters in there was a scene where the main character \\"scrambles\\" into an elevator, \\"stumbles\\" out, and nearly \\"sprawls\\" onto the lobby floor. And no, this is not a Three Stooges episode. I couldn't finish this book. I hate writing bad reviews, but when I see a book that everyone is talking about and I put my good money down, I really expect something outstanding. This reads like a young high school student's fiction assignment. If you must, try this first one, but I am thankful I didn't buy the whole trilogy at once and I would recommend against that. I paid the same for Elmore Leonard's Western story collection and that's 31 stories for the same money. And the writing is much better.<br /><br />And here's a recommendation: I'm the type that doesn't like to complain and not bring a solution to the table. I've found a young author that I have been pretty interested in. I'm halfway through his third book and I can't set it down. Some of the best writing I have read to date, sirs and madams: [[ASIN:B008J4NKA6 Dark Prairies]] If you like Cormac Mccarthy or just plain love great dialogue, this book is for you. And it's less than half the price. And here's the link for Leonard's book too [[ASIN:0061242926 The Complete Western Stories of Elmore Leonard]] Either one of these is ten times the book.<br /><br />By the way, I gave this book two stars because honestly the grammar was fine and the other basics of writing and though I couldn't finish it, I cannot honestly say I \\"hated\\" it (which is what Amazon says a one-star review means). I just didn't like it, particularly because of the hype. Nowhere near what I would have expected at this level. A wasted ten bucks for certain, but try it yourself if you think it might better suit you.yourself if you think it might better suit you.
B0081TZUAW|4.0|I liked it but not as good as their previous albums. I think that it was okay. Maybe I don't want to write so many words?
B000J10ERO|3.0|I recently rewatched this film twice on the same day to see if my opinion had changed from a few years ago.  To a degree it has.<br /><br />Warner Brothers took a major gamble with this film.  Unfortunately, it did not pay off for the studio and especially for the fans since they would have to wait until the Summer 2013 for a new film which may or may not be a hit.<br /><br />Overall, it's a nice production, costumes, sets, and music.  The story attempted to recapture the glory of the first two Superman movies (1978 and 1980).<br /><br />Sadly, the glory faded faster than the red sun of Krypton. Perhaps the most interesting parts of the film were the outtakes.<br /><br />It was a hard sell to see Lois Lane with another guy even if he was Perry White's nephew.  To top it off with a son was a bit too much.  Tristan Lake Leabu, as the young son, was the best cast in this film.<br /><br />Sorry, but Kevin Spacey never fully captured the essence of Lex Luthor.  There were moments, but moments are fleeting glimpses which do not satisfy. I have a high regard for Spacey as an actor.<br /><br />Brandon Roth was too perfect in the role--too pristine, too melancholy.  Of course, this has to do with the director who set the tone.<br /><br />Kate Bosworth's Lois Lane was low-keyed and bitter.  She never captured the fiery spirit of the previous versions of Lois or the suspicious gaze pondering how much Clark and Superman were alike.<br /><br />Special effects were decent.  The scene with the air force plane left much to be desired.  If Superman could pick up a mountain range loaded with kryptonite at the end of the film, he certainly could have handled the plane much better.  It was not a real challenge for Superman.<br /><br />Another villain like Doomsday, Brainiac, Ultraman or Darkseid would have been exciting.  A $209 million budget in 2006 could have made a great film.<br /><br />I give the film three stars because it is a Superman film.  Let's hope the Man of Steel is up to the challenge of propelling the DC Universe into the mainstream which Marvel is dominating.  However, General Zod has had his time in the yellow sun of earth--they could not have come up with a more exciting foe for Superman.  We shall see next summer.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game starts easy and gradually grows complicated. It gets really hard - but achievable. Be careful - time flies when you're having fun with this game!
B0080SZ0V8|1.0|At first I thought this app was great. It has a wide variety of puzzles and reminded me a lot of the excellent PC puzzle game, Pandora's Box. Then I got to the lines and dots puzzle, and found that no matter how carefully and firmly I tapped with my stylus, the game would always put my line in the wrong location, giving the computer an opportunity to get 5-8 moves ahead of me. Starting the puzzle over costs time, causing me to run out of time before I've finished the level, forcing me to start the level all over again from the beginning. VERY frustrating when it's not YOUR mistake, but the APP that makes you lose!<br /><br />Worse yet, there's a stupid wind-up robot game that not only requires planning several moves ahead, but speedy hand-eye coordination too because the second you tap to remove the instruction screen, the wind-up robot is off and running and there's no way to pause it! There isn't enough time to lay a path of arrows for him because he just moves too fast. It would be challenging enough if you were allowed to lay all the arrows down first, THEN start the robot. But with the robot already in motion at the start of the maze that thing's darned near impossible. You can use a 'magic orb' to skip a puzzle, but you only get one at the end of each level. Use one for the first lines and dots puzzle, one for the first robot game, and you're all out by the time you get to the second lines and dots puzzle and second robot game. Meanwhile, some of the other puzzles are so simple, a preschooler could solve them.<br /><br />If I could give this ZERO stars I would, because I'm now stuck halfway through the app and can't finish it. I may as well just delete it from my Fire. Game designers should know well enough to make it impossible for the player to get totally stuck and unable to finish the game no matter what they do.
0385344228|3.0|I read this book quickly, and it drew me in thoroughly. I can't quite put my finger on why I didn't think it was that great a book though. Good, but not great. I liked the way it was written and would read more by this author again.<br /><br />I guess my main complaints were these:<br /><br />1) The author got very repetitive. He gave us every detail of the crime from multiple angles - the narrative, then the trial transcript. But the narrative tended to rehash what was already said earlier. He went over the same musings about his wife again and again and again also. So it felt like filler - tighter editing would have helped this immensely.<br /><br />2) While I get it might have been on purpose, seeing Jacob only as reflected in other people's viewpoints was a weak spot in the book. You never got to know or care about the character that the action of the book revolved around.<br /><br />3) There is only so far into the sand one's head will go.<br /><br />4) The \\"Murder gene\\" angle was interesting, brought up, but glossed over and then dropped.<br /><br />With all that said, I DID enjoy the book, but I probably wouldn't re-read it.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|I purchased this to see what the hype was all about.  Great intro to characters in first couple of chapters then bang! Sex sex sex.  Has some funny moments but would prefer more storyline and less sex!

B000AARKW6|4.0|When I was in high school I had a Carlito's Way poster in my room. Why? Well, because Carlito's Way was an average New York gangster movie when it came out in 1993; one that didn't do big business at the box office, but was well done all around and managed to be a terrific movie. Oh, and it had Al Pacino and Sean Penn in it. I watched it again all the way through for the first time in years recently and it remains a stand out film. Not that the story is anything special; hood gets out of jail and tries to go straight, but gets pulled back into the life by family and circumstance and instinct and fate...But what makes Carlito's Way good is the acting, and the writing and even the direction. This may be one of Pacino's more underrated performances; honest, aged/aging, charismatic, volatile, and hopeful. He easily drives the film with a kind of energy that effectively clarifies Carlito's struggle to want out of the life. Sean Penn meanwhile is as unrecognizable and awesome as ever, as the slimy, vile lawyer who is at once Carlito's friend and nightmare. The two of them alone make the movie. Viggo Mortensen is great practically in a cameo, Luiz Guzman does a good Luiz Guzman character, John Leguizamo makes a memorable villain, and even Penelope Ann Miller is ok, as the love interest. Brian DePalma mixes in some interesting shots and stylish 70's scenes; extravagant coke parties, disco club life, NYC street scenes and subway scenes, he even revisits the train station shoot out scenario he mined in The Untouchables.<br /><br />Definitely recommended.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|When I read the description of Wool I thought it would be an interesting and easy read.  As I read it I was pleasantly surprised how well the book is written.  So many times I expected something to happen and at the end, there was a unexpected twist.  I read all 5 stories and this happened many times.  It is nice to see an author take a currently popular genre and make the story something different.  I read all the stories in less than 2 days just sitting the beach!  I would recommend this series to anybody who enjoys this type of story.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|This is a very entertaining game as well as rather addicting. Similar to Farmville but with more of a focus on building out your town and not just crops/animals. If you want to progress through the game faster you Aldo have the option of buying in game currency with real money.<br /><br />The major issue that I have with the game is trees do not grow back and saplings never grow after several days even weeks. I've been told this is not an issue on the iPad and other devices. Gameloft please fix this issue and other reported ones for the kindle fire!
0316920045|1.0|This is the most overindulgent, bombastic, boring, and overpraised book that I have ever read, except for another horrendous book, Atlas Shrugged, by Ayn Rand, which I also threw in the trash. I don't understand how he won an award for this, or why people expound with praise on what a genius this man is. An editor's job is to edit out the unnecessary, and help the author focus his craft and rein in out of control verbiage. His editor must have fallen asleep and never woke up - while reading this book. DFW's mental meanderings go on and on, with no conclusion, so dissatisfying, so tedious. A good story entertains, gets you on the edge wondering what will happen next; I had more fun reading the negative reviews about Infinite Jest, than Infinite Jest. Don't waste your time drudging through this book trying to get some conclusion, pay off, understanding of characters, or trying to care about them. You will not be satisfied. If the editor could have helped reveal the gems scattered within, and cut out the rest, perhaps he would have had something that would satisfy and deserve praise. I was sorry to hear that DFW killed himself. Perhaps the book reflects the mind of that instability, but regardless of that tragedy, subjecting yourself to this book may drive you to want to kill the book, like I did. It is on it's way to the city dump paper recycling center.
B0017ANAZO|1.0|When the movie was released, I didn't watch it because of the bad reviews. They were right. I caught the movie on television yesterday. Most of the movie was mediocre. It paled in comparison with the original.It was banal and might have earned a 2 except for the ending. The movie ending was ridiculous/stupid/rubbish.
0553579908|4.0|I found this book to be very slow moving in the beginning. Of course, by the end, I didn't want to put the book down, just like the first one. I liked getting new perspectives from different characters. Any fans of the series or the debut novel should definitely continue to this one.
0345803485|5.0|Are the characters far-fetched?  Yes...I think that's why this book falls into the fantasy/fiction category.  Even though Christian was damn-near perfect on the outside, it was balanced by his inner turmoil, a touching story about a traumatized young boy.  It made for a fun escape, as I soaked up all three novels in 7 days...  If my life was more like that of Anastasia and Christian, I could have happily read all three in one day.  But my family needed dinner, dogs needed walking, butts needed wiping, etc.<br /><br />I thought the character development was nicely done and loved the way different elements of the story tied in as it went on, in a way that left me gasping, squealing, laughing and at times crying.  I KNOW IT WASN'T REAL...but neither are most of the movies many of us get drawn into; it was a fun ride and it ended beautifully...everything wrapped up nicely and nothing hanging.<br /><br />Congrats to E L James on this debut trilogy...I'm 50 shades of impressed.
0553386794|5.0|I picked up this book after already having watched the first two seasons on HBO. Even though the first novel follows the first season almost exactly, I still found myself thoroughly engaged in the novel. Don't let the length deter you. This is a must-read for all fans of fantasy.
030758836X|5.0|I could not put this book down.  Certainly the best book I read all summer.  I loved the unlikable hard edges of the two main characters.  That doesn't mean you won't be enthralled by them. I was compelled and totally interested in both Nick and Amy.  The rough wit and style of Gillian Flynn is cool and I look forward to reading her previous novels.  You will not be disappointed by this amazing ride.  Fun, fun, fun...

B000YJ85BI|3.0|Scalzi is just too naive in his politics. Too many times while reading this book I've thought to myself: &#34;Nah, never would have happened.&#34;
1442419814|3.0|This book has all the elements of a successful YA novel: Adventure, friendship, teenage rebellion, a healthy dose of self-esteem, and even boyfriend stealing. When looking at the formula, it works. There is something in this story for nearly all young readers to latch on to and appreciate.<br /><br />However, the actual writing does not rise up to the promise of the plot. Westerfeld gets the job done, to be sure. But he is not a poetic or particularly poignant author. He chugs along with the story and describes the action aptly, with few flourishes or truly hard hitting passages. After just a few chapters, it became obvious that he relies on a fairly limited vocabulary and collection of phrases. (Really, what is with these characters and seeking to find purchase? They sought to find purchase more times in three days than I ever have in my life.)<br /><br />Westerfeld has the habit of continuously hitting us over the head with his intent to build self-esteem. Over and over again we're told how the protagonist is special, that she's the only one who understands, that she isn't like everyone else. The concept of \\"You're beautiful! I'm beautiful! Everybody is beautiful!\\" lacks any sort of subtlety. It's simply tossed in there so that even the most oblivious and jaded reader is able to walk away with the understanding that no one is \\"ugly.\\" Is this necessary? Perhaps it is for some readers. I'm sure that there are a great deal of kids out there who needed this reminder. But without even an attempt to hide this sermon, the majority will simply roll their eyes and wish for their own hoverboard.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app. My only complaint is that the only way to get lots of points is to repeatedly play the same games or spend money for points which are needed to unlock games.
0812550706|4.0|Ender's Game is wonderfully exciting and found a great balance between description and plot advancement that so many science-fiction works seem to lack. Reading Card's writing gave me a thorough understanding of this world that Ender lived in while maintaining my interest in his day to day struggles. While I was able to guess several of the plot twists before they occurred, their emergence was fluid and always managed to keep my attention. I finished this book within only a few days, barely wanting to set it down.<br /><br />I have a few issues with the portrayal of such young genius throughout the book, but Ender's age is one of the key points of the plot. It was required for him to behave and speak so maturely for a 6-12 year old, making him and his peers seem to operate on such a higher level than the average child. Creating such an unbelievable hero was necessary. However, that does not negate the fact that his development remained so far beyond reason. It was only the constant reminders that allowed me to keep in mind that I was reading about a young child, not a teenager or adult. While Card was able to express uniquely childlike fears and innocence at certain points, it was not enough to truly make Ender and the other school children into \\"real\\" people that had only been alive for 6ish years.
0062124293|1.0|Though I thought the sample was perhaps good enough to warrant reading the remainder, I found myself much disappointed. While I suspect I am beyond the years of those in favor of this type of diatribe, I must say this book was a complete waste of my time. Warning, warning, aliens approaching...a crass and sometimes vulgar read at best. So much to say and so unfit a voice. I suggest extending your search for something more readership worthy.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|There is no need to buy this book, amazon offers a few pages for free.  Once you see lines like \\"his voice is like dark melted chocolate caramel fudge.\\" you will know that unless you are a 13 year old girl who can still be amused by fan fiction, this book is not for you.  I am amazed at all the great reviews this book has gotten.  I can only imagine that if someone who thought that this book was good were to read something by a real storyteller, like Robert Jordan, or Terry Brooks, their minds would be blown at how much better reading can be than this crap.
B0058YPL66|4.0|Not sure how the DVD will be seeing how it's not released yet but the program is awesome much better then that Glee garbage.<br /><br /> I'm happy to see a second season given the nut jobs with there wacky rating system.Cancelled C.S.I Miami but ran another season of Big Brother and Survivor just shows the I.Q. level of those watching television these days.If you got to do a single ounce of thinking to watch something well cancel it.
0201633612|4.0|For those from the java background, this book will be a tough read. It's written for C++ readers in mind as seen from the examples it gave as well as the concepts it presents. Being the ground-breaking book on design patterns, no surprise it is a classic.<br /><br />However, it is a book that will put many casual reader off.. It is meant for expert level developers who can easily read through the case study put forth and start picking off the required design pattern from the catalog. In terms of ease of reading or absorption of information, it does not attempt to make things anything easy nor fun nor instructional.<br /><br />Design pattern was meant to solve a problem as they illustrate in the case study and they dispense with instructions. Even the introduction was meant to get the reader off the ground as quickly on how to select and use a design pattern.<br /><br />For me, after inheriting this book from the DOSE team member who left it behind, and after passing through 3 semester of my NUS masters of technology, I am pretty much on route to skipping the design pattern module. The concepts are in me and on google/ wikipedia and it is the ideas that makes this book a classic. Otherwise, reading it from cover to cover is a chore. Time to let go this for the next undergraduate in NUS via its book donation drive.

0316017930|2.0|This is a well written book about why, who, and the way people<br />have attained certain stature. When the old Tony Robbins books<br />motivate to say \\"anyone\\" has the power to be the best; realistically.<br />This book, although true, attempts to box people into categories and<br />indicate this is why someone is successful. Steve Jobs and Bill Gates<br />are lucky. They had the right influences and/or means to make them<br />what they became. Nonsense. Sure, that can help, but I believe in<br />the U.S. anyone with the determination and right attitude can thrive;<br />contrary to Gladwell's thinking. If he is right, many of us should<br />throw in the towel and think to ourselves that this is one of the worst<br />points economically, so sit on your hands. I believe that his research<br />is accurate but the premise that we are a reflection of the date we were<br />born, or the time frame we enter the work force, etc., is incorrect. If<br />anything, when everyone else's attitude is in the gutter, it may be the<br />best time to excel. We live in a competitive world. Less competition from<br />those that believe like Gladwell, the better.

B0088RQ4X4|4.0|Even though this movie doesn't follow the books it does remain true to the basic story. I think Edgar would have liked it. All the characters are there but with a slightly different take on their relationships (especially between Carter and the princess).I thought Wolla was the best part of the movie its sad they couldn't show how much Wolla meant to John Carter. In the book John felt until he met the princess that Wolla was the only thing on Mars that could show him love. Maybe Disney should make a movie about John and his best friend Wolla - it would be a great kids movie. In all this is a good movie.
B008OJIBH8|3.0|(I have to place a \\"star-rating\\" to get this comment posted, so it gets 1 Star for now.)<br />First the Harry Potter set, then the Avengers set and now this. According to Blu-Ray.com, this limited edition \\"spaceship\\" contains the Blu-Ray and just a UV digital copy. For $140?!?!?!? I know it's early to judge, but the regular Blu-Ray/Digital copy set, which pre-orders are currently @ $18 has a PROPER Digital Copy and the oh-so-horribly-lame UV copy included. So, unless this ET Spaceship Edition includes a regular DC, I cannot see the logic in purchasing this item. Period.<br /><br />Update: It has been pointed out to me that the Image has now been added since my original post. Also the \\"BD +Ultraviolet\\" part has been dropped and now it just says \\"BD Combo Pack\\", and a nice price reduction. Bravo, Amazon, Bravo. 3 Stars.

0345803485|2.0|I've read a few of the first reviews here. Especially the 1st negative ones.  Could not agree more.  I doubt anyone will get down to reading mine, so I will be more graphic in my language.<br />This is worse than adolescent, this is toddler fairy-tale.<br />Ohhh, the repetitiousness of it all.  The absolute preposterousness of it all.  A 21 year old woman being a virgin, I will buy.  But, as stated by others before me, to call her genitals 'down there' or 'my sex?'<br />I certainly knew the terms 'vulva, mons, labia, both majora and minora' along with clitoris at that age.  And this was in the '60's.  It's appalling that this woman knows so little about her own body.<br />Also, let's get a little reality in here.  No urinary tract infections? No yeast infections?  HAH!  Baloney.  I am aware that this book only took place over a matter of days, but these little devilish problems often crop up immediately after a woman begins having sex.  My mother was a nurse in the '40's.  It was called 'honeymoon cystitis' for a reason.<br />And, honestly, wouldn't any penis look large to Ana?  She is, after all, a virgin.  One would think she has never before encountered an erect phallus before.<br />This book needs far tighter editing.  And far, far, more variety of adjectives and adverbs. To say nothing of more plot.<br />Some of the sex scenes are OK, but there are way too many and they go on for far too long.  This may be erotic for the participants, but it just bored me silly.  They varied only in some of the gymnastics  performed.<br />There is so much I want to criticize.  Perhaps I should have critiqued each of the 3 books after reading that one book.  Unfortunately I didn't.  Now I'm stuck, having read them all and trying to review one at a time.<br />This trilogy could and should have been written as one book.  Of course I understand why that didn't happen.  Money.  More Money.  For everyone but the poor readers.  I sincerely hope that women on a budget do NOT buy ANY ofthese books.  Borrow them. Pass them around.  They are not worth the paper they are written on.<br />Read a Harlequin Romance instead, or \\"The Flame and the Flower\\" by Kathleen Woodiwiss(sp?.)  They are much sweeter than this nonsense.  And they do not offend as does this swill.<br />I don't like writing negative reviews because I admire anyone with the discipline to put pen to paper and truly write a story.  This is not a story.  This is rot.
B007GATVYI|5.0|It is a wonderful thing to be passionate about what you do and to create a work environment where your employees truly matter. Anyone who is trying to improve employee engagement should read this book!<br />Thanks for sharing your success with us Tony!
0345803493|2.0|Not going to cover plot, which many other reviewers have done better than I can.  I am not going to just give this book 1 star, which it truly deserves because of the dreadful writing, because #1, the author has made some kind of effort, and #2, these books are kind of entertaining.  It's the equivalent of not being able to turn your eyes away from a terrible car accident or the likes.<br />Once again, because so many reviews have already been written, I seriously doubt this will be read.  So, I'm feeling like I'm talking to myself..<br />In some ways this felt a little \\"Bridget Jones\\" to me.  Must have been the use of the language was SO British.  As in \\"SHOUTY CAPITALS,\\"  \\"Laters, baby, et.al.  (If a man called me 'baby' as many times as Christian does Ana, I would probably hand him a thesaurus.  (My first husband talked baby-talk to me for the entire 5 or 6 years we were together.....fingernails on blackboards.  That's all I'm going to say. Other than I was so happy when he left me!!!)<br />OK. How would you feel were you to be with a person who constantly nagged you to eat, who always had to have the last word, tried to control not only when you could see your friends, but where.  Also, pouted, got angry, etc. if you had friends of the opposite sex.  If you were constantly saying to this person \\"Please don't be angry with me!?\\"  On top of this, this person is a total hypocrite regarding their own behavior, has a major double-standard concerning sexual standards.  He/she is non-communicative, stingy on details, does not like to be touched.  And we won't even touch the sexual peccadilloes.  Just talking about how it would FEEL to be with a person like this.  I would feel more, much, much more than fifty shades of smothered, outraged, isolated, emotionally abused.  And I'd be headed for a therapist's office ( and not his/her therapist's office) before I could say \\"Oh, my.\\"<br />I'm sorry.  No one is THAT good looking.  And one grows accustomed to the appearance ofanyone with whom they share a lot of time.  But these two go on & on about it endlessly.  I know men are highly visual, but this woman (me) is not and I'm not buying it.  And the repetition of how good they smell, feel, taste, touch, blah, blah, blah, blah.  In fact, if I wrote an entire review made up of words like \\"slick, penis, tumescence, velvety folds, orgasmic, soft skin, wetness,\\" it wouldn't be far from how this book feels in its majority.<br />But, it's the spirit that troubles & offends me very deeply.  I know I'm not supposed to take this so seriously, but there are so many millions of people reading this tripe.  I am concerned about how it might/could affect those of with more fragile egos.

B004H4XLJM|5.0|I'm new to zbrush and indeed any 3d application, so suffice to say, I really needed a resource that would hold my hand through the process of getting to grips with zbrush.  Scott Spencer doesn't assume you know everything and he also assumes that people will jump in to random chapters and expect to understand how the software works.  Thanks to Scott's careful handling, even if you do jump in too deep you will soon find yourself on firm ground as Scott reiterates keystrokes and mouse clicks needed to perform exercises.  Two notes of caution: firstly, the book is based on a previous release of zbrush so users of zbrush 4r3 or later would be WELL advised to couple this book with Zbrush character creation 2nd edition also by Scott Spencer.  Secondly, zbrush is addictave; don't buy any books on zbrush unless you are prepaired to cease functioning as a normal human.  I would also highly reccomend Introducing zbrush 4.  If you buy the ebook, zsupporting Dvd can be downloaded from booksupport.Wiley.com.  thankyou for a hugely enjoyable learning experience.
0307352145|1.0|[[ASIN:0307352145 Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking]]<br /><br />Lack of focus and choppy style leaves one searching for a concise, descriptive concept of the power of introverts.  Confusing research studies and poorly presented statistics are mind numbing.  Descriptions of the author's boondoggles to various gurus' gatherings are tiresome and worthless.  Along with the tedious research data and seminar commercials, insufficient investigation weakens the author's credibility.<br />Three examples beginning on page 133. The author attends an Elaine Aron (guru) gathering.  Participants are primarily mental health professionals who are self-defined \\"sensitivity\\" (introvert) people.  The gathering has a \\"Where's Waldo\\" quality. The author is obviously an extrovert.  Aron appears to be an extrovert who has successfully created and marketed an I'm-an-introvert-just-like-you persona.  The participants can't wait to talk at length to the large group about their tortured lives as \\"sensitivity\\" people.  Where's the introvert?  Moving on from the tedious Aron gathering, on pages 148 and 149 we are presented a biologist research project regarding the nesting and hunting activity of shy birds including a stunningly misleading cut-and-paste description of Jung's extrovert and introvert types.  With great haste and no logic, enter Al Gore on page 149- Al Gore the introvert!  Who knew? He said he was an introvert; \\"by many accounts\\" he's one; an aide said, \\"He needs rest after an event.\\" So, that science is settled - Al Gore is an introvert. The author describes Gore's work as a \\"decades long crusade to raise awareness of global warming.\\" She gushes in her reference to his \\"Oscar-winning movie An Inconvenient Truth.\\" Had the author done her homework she might have gained some insight into Gore's stunning hypocrisy and the more than thirty-five inaccuracies, aka lies, in his Oscar-winning film. As it relates to this book, it is utterly absurd to labelany politician an introvert, let alone Al Gore.
0307744434|3.0|From the first page the writing bothered me. I am guessing this is true because of the way the words flowed. The characters themselves were hit or miss. I was OK with Celia and OK with Marco but I adored Poppet, Widget, and Herr Thielson the most. Even the man in the Gray Suit was interesting but everyone else didn't do anything for me. I found Bailey to be dull and I found some aspects of the story to be downright cheesy at times. The circus revures were also a bit silly because they kept following the circus around like a bunch of rock groupies. It just didn't do anything for me.<br /><br />I really adore magical stories that take place in a different world or a different time and place. But this story fell short of a lot of my expectations. I think all the hype made me grab the book in anticipation of it being something magical. Instead, it fell short of what I thought. However, towards the middle of the book I really started enjoying it more but the ending wasn't what I expected. Since everyone kept talking about the story of the wizard in the tree I kept thinking Marco and Celia would end up the same way. Instead, they didn't and she followed her father's footsteps which was a contradiction since she was said to be entirely different then him.<br /><br />So it sounds almost like I didn't enjoy the story. I did and most of the time I didn't. In the end I gave it away so that someone else can perhaps enjoy it. If I could give it two and a half stars I would but three will suffice. I think it would flow better as a movie.

068483605X|5.0|When this book was published in 1972, I bought and devoured it.  It is a wise, real and beautiful story of life, the struggle to overcome hardship and the joy of the simple gifts that are part of our journey.  The fact that the characters in Watership Down are mostly rabbits is secondary to the action.  It is a great adventure full of images that refresh the mind.<br /><br />I have read this first edition once a year at least since 1972, and I am about to order another copy -- hopefully the type will be like the original -- which has been read until it has totally fallen apart.<br /><br />I think this story is not for everyone.  If the reader continues to have a child's enjoyment of nature and an appreciation for allegory, then this is a good choice.  I wish very much that I had never read Watership Down, so that when my new copy arrives, I would have the joy of reading it for the first time.

B00846REIS|3.0|This was an entertaining read with many parallels to Fifty Shades but certainly not on the same level. I felt cheated in the ending because Gideon Cross's character was just under developed. The story line just ended too soon leaving the reader to wonder why the author could not give more insight into his character. Also, considering the fact that the sequel will not be released until October, readers will have forgotten the characters and the story line.

1608870081|3.0|First off, the images are beautiful, detailed, and accurate to the movie series.  I've enjoyed looking at the images and reading the information on each page.<br /><br />That said, I did find some issue with the pop-up construction.  These are large pop-ups and I assume the construction is complex, but I didn't expect to have continuous issues with pop-ups sticking half-open and having to finagle with them to get them to straighten up.  Also I don't know if it's just a flawed book I have, but the dragon head is positioned so it looks like it is staring at the floor with her chin/jaw planted on her chest.  It looks awkward and wrong, bothering me every time i look at that page.<br /><br />I had purchased two because it was such a great deal at the time ($9 ea.) and am still intending to give the second as a gift.  I know that even if the pop-ups are sticky my friend (a true HP fan) will still love it.

B004ZY0VHY|3.0|First of all, no major spoilers here. Don't worry.<br /><br />I bought this book with high hopes due to its premise; I find the psychology of depraved people to be very interesting. Who doesn't? I was hoping for an eerie, suspenseful tale where we got a lot of insight not only into Kevin's psychology but also the mindset of the people around him, like his family and his classmates. What I got instead was a wordy book presented exclusively by Kevin's mother, who gave us virtually no believable insight into the psyche of anyone else. Hence the title of my review: annoyed and unsatisfied.<br /><br />Let's cover annoyed first. The word choices of the author killed me. Since I've had my Kindle, I have this compulsion to highlight any word I'm unsure of to read the definition. Because this author insisted on using tons of obscure words, I spent a lot of time with my Kindle dictionary, to the point where it was interrupting the flow of the story. To make it even more annoying, some of these words were used multiple times: gimcrack, lassitude, laconic, diffidence, ascetic, nascent, anodyne, parvenu (to name a few). It really got ridiculous, like the author was just trying to show off. We get it, you're smart and know a lot of fancy and obscure words. Good for you. It's distracting!<br /><br />Now for unsatisfied. Maybe this makes me less sophisticated, but when I read stories like this part of what drives me is the desire for some kind of justice: the bad guy gets exposed, the people around the bad guy lay the smack down, etc. This book is lacking in that department. It's like Eva, the narrator, knows her son is a sociopath and is just like \\"Oh well\\". WTF?! Don't even get me started on Franklin, Kevin's father, who overlooks and makes excuses for so many instances of weird behavior by Kevin that you start to hate his character...seriously, nobody could be that dumb. There were several instances of strange things happening around Kevin that went under-questioned and investigated by everyone involved, to an absurd degree. Also, Celia was a ridiculous character: Eva knows her son is a sociopath, and wants to have another child? Presumably this is to see if there's something wrong with her, which would be confirmed in her eyes if the second kid came out as a sociopath. So she's conducting some kind of experiment that can only have two outcomes: either the second kid is a sociopath and you end up with two of them, or they aren't and end up getting tormented by the psycho sibling. Good idea, Eva.<br /><br />This book's premise had a lot of potential, but I'm left regretting that I spent so much time reading it (it took me  about three weeks to get through, which in and of itself says that I didn't love it: a book I love will get crushed in a week or less). When I was done, all I was left with was Eva's attitude: \\"He's a sociopath. Oh well.\\"
B008BM9L72|1.0|Total waste of money. Very badly written and edited. Author had vivid imagination which borders on the ridiculous. All three books are utterly boring and repetitive. The character Christian shows him to be a thoroughly mixed up adult. As for Anatasia....She is totally OTT. This book is aimed at teenagers who are highly excitable and possible of low imaginations and IQ.<br />All three books could have been written within fifty pages. I suffered all three books as a friend told me that each one got successively better.....Sadly this is not the case.<br />If one is a dedicated Mills & Boons reader then one might tolerate this trilogy but to be honest Mills & Boon books are 100% better written.<br />All three books just deserve a place at the bottom of a bin.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I jumped on the Fifty Shades bandwagon in the early summer and I'm so glad I did. I read all 3 books in the trilogy and I loved them all. (The 3rd book is definitely the best. It has the most interesting story line.) I can't wait for the movie to come out.
B002R88G5E|5.0|Having previously read The Kite Runner I couldn't wait to read A Thousand Splendid Suns & I was not disappointed.<br />Superbly written and as with his previous book it gave one great insight into the history of Afghanistan.<br />It is vividly descriptive and at times harrowingly sad as it tells and follows the lives of two women and their daily living in Kabul.<br />This is a book that one doesn't to put down and I look forward to reading more of Khaled Hosseni's books in the future.
B001MW0J2Y|3.0|I will just say this about the album it feels very experimental. The mood of entire album feels incomplete like unfinished songs or songs that did not make the cut for other albums or band material. There is however one song on the album that shines through the true abilities of John Frusciante and that is \\"Central\\". It's also the reason I purchased the album expecting to hear more of this soulful type of music from John but mostly the other songs are far from achieving the same emotion and spirit that this song brings. To be honest the other songs on the albums sound dreary like funeral music. Very different from the vibrant sound and songs of the RHCP's. Also if you expected to hear John playing guitar (what he does best) you will actually hear very little of it. There aren't many or any songs really that highlight is ability as a guitarists on the album. I was a surprised to not see John showing his Stratocaster skills throughout the album with insane solo's and shreds. It's the exact opposite of most of his work. While a majority of the songs have a mellow vibe to them they aren't bad, just not what your used to from John. I respect John exploring himself as an artist but truly feel like this album could have used more work on it and maybe an additional writer to help with some of the songs as some of them just loop to no end and feel like somethings missing. I wouldn't exactly call this album the best Frusciante has to offer but it does show a different side of him. Depending on which John your looking for you'll either love or think of it as so so.

0307592731|2.0|I do have to admit that at least this author doesn't commit the eye-rolling atrocity that so many undertaking-reporting memoir authors do--that is, winking at the reader constantly while basically saying, \\"Aren't I just so incredibly clever and madcap?\\"<br /><br />And I did read the book all the way through, though I am glad it was a library book and I didn't spend my money on it.<br /><br />Because...<br /><br />Although I was very moved by her observations about her poor mom, and about death, and dreaming of the dead, and missing them (it resonated with me because of recent losses in my world), and enjoyed her retellings about the various people she met (particularly a little boy who sings \\"Red River Valley), I was repulsed by her promiscuity and her constantly returning to fretting about sex. Seems like every time she meets a guy she's thinking of hopping in the sack with him. I've known plenty of women like this in my life and they were reeeeally irritating to be around (saying this as a woman myself). Constantly prowling. Keep yer boyfriend or husband away from her, ladies.<br /><br />This \\"ick\\" factor is raised by her descriptions of having sex...fortunately, allusions to her highly active sex life are far more frequent than her descriptions of the act itself.<br /><br />She gets an abortion at one point and is so casual about it that it makes me feel as if I want to become a so-called right-to-lifer.<br /><br />Her lack of preparation and cluelessness about setting out on the PCT made me shake my head in wonderment, but I wasn't bugged by it--it was frightening, and amusing sometimes, to read, and did grip me: How would she get out of this snafu?<br /><br />But that cluelessness absolutely horrified me when it came to the terrible, cruel, and heartless way that she and her family killed their Mom's beloved, aged horse. First of all, the family neglects the poor creature (yes, 31 is old for a horse, but many of them enjoy long and healthy years after that, if,for example, they're FED...). Then, to save money, they decide to shoot the horse themselves, and bungle the job entirely, causing this beautiful animal to die in horrible agony.<br /><br />The author claims to have dreams in which the horse presents her with flowers and forgives her, but oh my God, this reminds me I better put in writing what I want done with my own animals when I pass and provide money to rescue them from people like this.<br /><br />All in all, I didn't give up on the reading trail or skip any of it, and it wasn't as tiresome as \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" (and I can honestly say I really, really wanted her to receive all her parcels at the post offices along the way!), but I just couldn't give my heart over to a person who cheats on her husband, sleeps around, and does drugs, I guess especially because, even though she's self-effacing, she makes a comment about a nice guy she meets who's an accountant and has a girlfriend and reveals that his life is therefore \\"boring.\\" Please note that it's the taxes paid by \\"boring\\" people like him that help maintain the parks she stops at, not to mention the trail itself.

030746363X|4.0|The 4-Hour Body is a great title, and plys into the author's other \\"4-Hour\\" themes.  Whether you can truly live on 4 hours of sleep, or have a hardbody in 4 hours a month at the gym strikes me as questionable - but certainly inticing enough to read about - and maybe even try.<br /><br />The better elements of the book revolve around the need for an intelligent diet program, and an exercise program that is going to get you moving, but not be so crazy as to consume your life.  The diet is a mix of Atkins, South Beach, and other low-carb/slow-carb diets.  There is a focus on measurement that belies the author's business roots.  And more than anything - what gets measured gets managed, and vice versa.  If the approach works, it is as much because of the measurement as the diet itself.<br /><br />The high intensity training (HIT) approach to exercise is both well proven and reasonably well discussed in the book.  Having said that, I am a believer that it is truly effective only with the use of a trainer or accountability partner, as most of us are not disciplined enough to push to failure on our own.  However, something is better than nothing, and Ferriss doesn't make it look impossible to follow.<br /><br />Finally, of course, there are the sex and superhuman claims of the title.  If you can have a super body, sleep 2 hours per day, be healthy, rich and successful - probably you are superhuman and sex won't be much of an issue.  For the rest of the world, it's good marketing, there are some mildly interesting elements here, but certainly nothing that will really make you a superhuman love machine (unless you can hit the prefecta noted at the beginning of the paragraph).<br /><br />The 500+ pages also goes into medical baselining and supplimentation.  Both are somewhat expensive and may or may not be right for every reader.  Having said that, the book covers the information in some detail and the author's writing style makes it interesting to read.<br /><br />What gets measured gets managed, and this book and program will get you measuring and managing your body. That alone, as well as the pretty entertaining writing style, makes the book worth a read.easured gets managed, and this book and program will get you measuring and managing your body.

B001BC2ZS6|4.0|I must admit that I had never read this masterpiece before.  As I was searching for a short read, I thought this title would fit the description well. The story is set in California during the Great Depression.  I think part of what made this novel good (the slang) was also what made it difficult to follow sometimes.  However, it was definitely hard to put down!  I was NOT prepared for the ending!
B007L3BMGA|4.0|I lost interest in the frist book half way in yes it is a bit of  escapism and really easy to read, the main character far from finding him sexy and intense found him annoying.I was about to give up as I had enough of the sex ( some of which was really unrealistic ) but took a quick look at the second and third book and thats when  the story got interesting for me and I was hooked.<br /><br />Well worth a read if only to see what the hype is all about also you need to be able to converse with your girlfriends as every one it seems  is reading  them,and good topic of conversations. Interesting it appears it keeping husbands  on  their toes as they are not sure why we reading it.

B001EZ2T7W|5.0|It's mid-2012 and I've watched this film about 5-6 times by now.  As far as reviews go, I give Continuum 5-stars as a fine sci-fi B-movie with the understanding that B-movies should be judged within their own category.  Due to budget constraints, this work went direct to DVD and was never intended as a major theatrical release; many of those who wrote very negative reviews apparently did not understand this. True, there was no award-winning score, parts of the film seemed rushed, we couldn't spend enough time with our beloved characters and there were plot holes you could drive a truck through, but who cares? This is SG-1 on another mission to save the galaxy, there's no time for all that other stuff!<br /><br />I thought Continuum was the perfect end to the franchise but had my fingers crossed when they rebooted the series with Stargate Universe, a show that went down in flames and deservedly so (though the final two episodes got it right, just too late). There comes a time when all good things must come to an end; for Stargate, it was with Continuum.<br /><br />Side Note: It was nice that they gave Claudia Black a completely different character, a very juicy role as bad bad girl who ends up slicing her husband (a system lord no less) in half -- vertically -- from head to -- uh -- the family jewels. Now THAT's just plain mean!<br /><br />I wish we had more entertainment of this caliber; you know, good guys vs. bad guys, good guys win.  I think that's why this show appealed to adults just as much as it did to the kids. These characters had principles, morals and stood up for the the things they believed to be right and true -- no moral ambiguity, no relativism, no philosophical navel-gazing. More importantly, they were family and some of us considered them a part of our family.<br /><br />As he stood near the gate entrance ramp to give last-minute orders to SG-1 and see them off on yet another dangerous mission, General Hammond would always impart these final wordsas the team entered the gate:<br /><br />\\"God speed, SG-1.\\"

0425170349|4.0|Rainbow Six, he indulges in small unit tactics for a whole tome. In many ways typical Tom Clancy, the book is instructive at a layman level about anti-terrorist tactics as practiced by special forces units. I have little doubt that the usual level of research went into this book that Mr Clancy usually carries out. I admit to being an unabashed fan.<br /><br />So why not five stars?<br /><br />Well, to be honest, nothing ever goes wrong for these guys. The books continuously alludes to the virtual certainty of problems with operations, but then nothing really does. I kept waiting for the problem and the subsequent analysis, but it never happened. I realized that, among the other obvious things that I like about Clancy, the recognition of the failings that people have and the way these play out on a broad stage are much of what I enjoy about his books. This one doesn't really have that.

B00786XVOG|5.0|It has only been six years since Yanni released his last live album entitled Yanni Live! The Concert Event. While some things remain the same, such as Yanni's always reliable drummer Charlie Adams along with a few other repeating band members, what is very obvious is the focus on new material as well as Yanni's high energy enthusiasm that has translated into his latest live recording. Recorded on the most north western point of Old San Juan in Puerto Rico, the El Morro fort is rugged yet romantic. Apparently, the location has rubbed off on Yanni's performance that is touching yet dynamic, resulting in a moving live performance courtesy of the CD/DVD presentation of Live At El Morro, Puerto Rico.<br /><br />Struggling with the unknown elements of the weather, which is clearly evident via the DVD presentation, Yanni begins the show boldly by presenting his audience with the gorgeous title track from his last studio album Truth Of Touch. He then double dares himself by jumping right into the more aggressive \\"Vertigo\\" also from his brand new album. Talking charge on the keyboards, Yanni does not hesitate to allow fellow keyboard player Ming Freeman to spotlight later into the song, supplemented by the pounding drums of Adams.<br /><br />While there are only ten tracks on the cd live performance, Yanni chooses wisely by also sharing two live renditions of older songs for the first time. The first obvious one is \\"Nightingale\\" taken from the Tribute album with a simply sublime vocal performance from Lauren Jelencovich. She continues her magnificent vocal performance courtesy of \\"Ode To Humanity\\" (previously titled \\"Aria\\" that received significant exposure on the British Airways advertisement). This time around Lauren is given some vocal assistance from Lisa Lavie, as well as allowing the horn section the opportunity to warm up. Then we are introduced to the first committed to tape live rendition of \\"Niki Nana (We're One)\\" from the album of the same title, by which time Yanni and the band are for the lack of a better phrase a unified jam band.  With Yanni being the bandleader, the horn section comes close to something that you would expect from Chicago. Meanwhile, the soulful wailing vocal rendition from Lisa Lavie is a blast as is Freeman's solo on the organ.  If you want to fully enjoy this performance check out the visual rendition on the DVD as the energy level is nothing short of full throttle leaning more towards an R&B band. While speaking of the DVD, check out the \\"Harp Solo\\" from Victor Espinola or perhaps we should just call him harp extraordinaire as he plays his harp like a guitar. You have to see it to believe it.<br /><br />In between the live recordings from Yanni's brand new album and the older classics being committed to tape for the first time, he still wisely revisits his cornerstone songs such as \\"The Rain Must Fall\\", \\"Felitsa\\" and \\"The End Of August\\". And while Yanni does not hesitate to surround himself with a first class band, it is still the mesmerizing melodies of Yanni's music that is the focal point. Clearly his recent studio explorations have translated to amped up live performances making Live At El Morro, Puerto Rico very clear and compelling evidence that actually seeing Yanni live should be on your very short list.ni and the band are for the lack of a better phrase a unified jam band.

The sentences are short and easy for a two year old to understand.<br /><br />What we like most about this book is the fact that it sheds positive light on getting a sibling. It highlights all the wonderful things that a \\"big kid\\" can do that a new baby can't such as eat \\"pizza and apples and ice cream\\" and play. Another facet of the book that we enjoy is that it mentions that one should \\"ask Mommy\\" before holding the baby. We appreciated that safety-oriented tidbit. It also ends with the mention that \\"I'm the only me in the whole world\\" and that is what makes me special to Mommy and Daddy. Quite a bit of thinking went into this little book to help foster self-confidence and good feelings in the older sibling.<br /><br />Need fact or science-based info on pregnancy, labor and delivery for your child? It isn't in this book. Want to introduce breastfeeding to your child? Not here either. The baby gets bottle fed.<br /><br />The only time my toddler seems to grasp the concept that our family is getting bigger is when we talk about it after reading this book. He requests that we read it to him at bedtime. We intend on using other copies as shower gifts for our friends.
B008393Q2O|3.0|...to rate with negative stars I would give this a negative 5 stars. it doesn't work at all. I have a 4month early premature baby so I needed something that I could also jot down quick notes to keep my phone just as organized as my home calendar...NOT happening with this all.  I want a refund.<br /><br />UPDATE 9/20/2012: Finally trying this app out....I will revise the entire review after more use.<br /><br />UPDATE: I have used the app here and there. I am still not a fan of it. Maybe because I had a terrible experience with this app in the start. Good luck to those of you that install this app and use it. In case anyone is confused: The app is fine, it is just not for me.
1401937519|4.0|I found this book interesting, especially from the NDE angle and also from the spontaneous cancer reversal story Anita recounts.<br />But I find some of the other revelations in the book to grate against my gut feelings.<br />It's worth a read though, but remember that it is only one person's view of the afterlife, so it might pay to read other accounts of NDE's before making any hard and fast rules about whether there is any judgement for your actions in this life and so on.<br />Not that I suggest that you make any hard and fast rules.<br />I agree with most of it, but not all of it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|No matter what some of the reviews say I think that this book is great! I could not stop reading it and it is not a book that I will soon forget.

0061767581|4.0|This book was pretty interesting, so was the rest of the books in this series. I am now following her spin-off series.  Although the idea of writing about your life isn't original, I would like to thank Lauren for writing this book herself and not tricking her fans by producing a book written with a ghostwriter.
B008B3H4VQ|5.0|This album is great. It is my favorite Linkin Park album since Meteora. It balances the rap and metal in that iconic Linkin Park sound.
0446613444|4.0|The Black Ice is a story of detective Bosch who investigates the murder of a fellow police officer and takes him all the way into Mexico as he digs to find the root of the crime. The resolution is quite unusual yet satisfying. The story is gripping and moves fast. A fine thriller. Recommended.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|This movie was so awesome, I ran out & immediately bought the soundtrack and I haven't taken it out of my CD player for a week!!! The only song I would scratch is the pop song \\"Undercover Love\\", which I understand is part of the movie, but I view this as truly a rock album and it doesn't belong. My favorite track is (without a doubt) \\"More Than Words/Heaven\\"!!! I absolute love this medley and Julianne Hough and Diego (forgot his last name, sorry) knock this one out of the park!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love that game. its so entertaining and my little brother likes it 2. its very fun 2 play and prediict what ur town could be
0446572993|5.0|Baldacci is one of my favorite authors and, up until now, Absolute Power -- his first book -- was perhaps my favorite but The Innocent is right up there. Despite what others have said, I was not disappointed with how he tied the ends up. OK, maybe the \\"collateral damage\\" folks was a bit of a stretch but it still worked. And normally, I'm not fond of teenagers in this type of book but Julie was good! A smart street wise kid that wasn't acting like an annoying teenager. Thanks for a good story!
B0015AARJI|1.0|This controller was a phony , and it came in a sony package .<br /><br />The label on the bottom of the controller was different , and it was lighter in weight . Also the controls didn't work the same .<br /><br />When I looked on youtube I found several postings of video's of this phony Sony .<br /><br />Heed my warning and don't buy this item .
B008BRC6NS|1.0|This collection is weak. How in the world could they have left off the #1 single with LL COOL J?  The new songs on the collection sound like leftover filler tracks.  I would rather listen to J to the lo remixes.  This 2012 collection is little to be desired. Sorry j lo you could have done much better.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is one of my favoite games  once  me and my  cousin  were  fighting  over  it  because  it  was  so  good.
B003YUU62U|5.0|I have the regular, ordinary crocs.  I wear those around the house.  I now have these canvas Crocs (faux Vans).  My new favorite shoes.  I wore them in Europe while walking all day; I wear them to work (who can see what I wear under my desk?).  Prior to this, my favorite everyday shoes were Merrell Jungle Mocs.  Now these are.  Give them a try.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I love post apocalyptic novels, but usually read zombie books.  I came across this at Amazon, and though I'm not sure what caught my eye, I thought I'd give it a read.  It was soooo much better than I expected.  Someone will make a tv series out of this.  The books get better, as the story develops.  I'm so glad I found these books.
B0086700CM|2.0|I was looking foreward to this game.... but it turned out to be horrible. gave my kindle fire a virus and it froze up my whole device... don't get it.  &gt;: 
B0062NAX1U|5.0|More movies of this caliber should be made to encourage men to be better role models for their children and familes. Excellent quality and easy to watch!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I looooooooooooooove it I love it love it it is so fun I hope u like it toits a great game I love it
0385534639|4.0|Reading this book was, for me, pure escapism into a magical world as imaginative as Alice's Wonderland. How perfect to inhabit a circus based on dreams and, as a reader, to see the illusionist or magician at work creating a world within a world. The more I read the more I admired the author's amazing imagination and how she conjured up not only the sights and sounds of hundreds of different facets that exist in the circus, but also their smells and textures. The basic premise of a contest between the main characters and knowing that it will be a fight to the death kept me turning the pages but it was the delightful atmosphere that had me hooked. If such a circus came to my town, I know I'd join it. I often wondered, as I read, how it would end and I think whatever the author decided on would've been a slight disappointment but, in any case, that is the reason I've taken one star off.
B004JZBGWI|2.0|Clever note app that needs a little tweaking.<br />1. There should be the option to choose where the notes are being stored within the device. This could solve the issue brought up of lost data when updating because the notes would be stored as files that the app would just need to retrieve it.<br />2. There should be an option to include filename extensions.<br />With these two additions this app could be absolutely wonderful, but until then, I think that it doesn't quite cut it.
B007PS0X0W|3.0|It was not nearly as exciting as the first 2 Underworld movies. I was really looking forward to this one, but was somewhat let down. Not enough action or story line. Too much time spent on the daughter character. Overall, disappointed.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It remembers what you last entered. Shows under the calculation what you entered so you can verify. When you close it; it remembers the last entry when you re-open it. The calculation screen and numbers are big enough and easy to read! Keep up the great work and please don't go overboard with the extra fancy calculations. although they would probably be better on a paid version. I just need the regular calculator with the &radic; sign and I'm good to go! THANK YOU!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I absolutely love this game! ive been playing it every free minute. its just too much fun and so addicting!
B0086700CM|5.0|a amazing game hats at the beginning but so much fun had a hard time purring it down deginetlh worth buying
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|pretty good game. recommend you play it now.  I usually hats game that are limited by &quot;energy &quot; but this one is good enough despite the feature
B006VA57CY|5.0|Great writing, incredible acting...love both seasons! So enjoyed this series, especially since tv centers around sexual comments and crude humor today.  so glad to have something of substance to watch!
B008KRJWEK|5.0|this game is like temple run but way better yea sure in temple run all u do is run and go for ad long as u can but but mutant roadkill is more than that
B000FVE3A2|5.0|I have been wanting a new watch for quite some time now, my friend had recommended this watch. Basically it is Rolex quality for a fraction of the price. I have received very good comments on this watch, and I am very pleased with the quality and workmanship of this product. So much as to I have already been looking at more Invicta watches to purchase.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game! very challenging once you get to the 10 x 10! If you like strategy&hellip; you will love this.
B005WGBQ9G|5.0|This is a great and easily addicting series.  You grow to care about their characters.  Just enough surprise and suspense to make it good without being a horror movie.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This story was more than just about sex. I wanted to know each character, feel their pain, and encourage them to blossom. really great book.
B001N3GUIE|5.0|If you are upgrading your cinema habit as economically as possible, a good place to put your money is in graphically important films that have been released in BluRay.  So far, I've collected: Forbidden Planet, 2012, Independence Day and plan on 2001 and a few others.  These films are all optically significant films with threshold film graphical content that involved improvements in Motion Picture Art.  Since the main technical difference between the new HD TV monitors and players is digital optical resolution, it makes sense to start with the movies that will best exploit the improved resolution.<br /><br />As to the quality of the film, it has been well-described by others, but it may be worth mentioning that this film  (and very few others, like \\"When Worlds Collide\\" and \\"War of The Worlds\\"  represented the motion picture use of the BEST OF Science Fiction Illustrative Art.  The relatively new color genre on Sci-Fi book covers, DoubleDay Science Fiction Covers, the comic books and even ViewMaster 3D viewers from the 1950's were making extensive use of beautiful conceptual paintings (brush, airbrush, tempera,etc.) to illustrate the anticipation of Outer Space Travel.  Set designers and concept artists in Hollywood had been using beautiful illustrations to storyboard movies and inspire directors with production design but now what was needed were illustrations and matte paintings on film that would give viewers a quality image of a futuristic reality good enough to suspend disbelief in what they were seeing on screen.  This succeeded or failed with audiences based on the apparent mechanical viability and textural realism of the art.  By employing fantasic background illustrations with high-end film masking and matte-painting, this film is the best at designing a believable futurama from it's generation.  Sadly, adding motion to non-photographic, imaginary subjects like the \\"Id\\" monster required classical hand-drawn cartoon animation.  This limitation may be one ofthe few areas that date the work.  The somewhat corny sexism about Anne Francis and the pop psychology theme may be dated but are still flourishing today.  Her sexploitation in this film ironically helped her become one of the first female action sheros on television nine years later in her gound-breaking series, \\"Honey West.\\"<br /><br />The Special Features included with this release are great.  Being the same age as the documentary interviewees,  Spielberg, Lucas and Cameron  - I had the same experiences, I just didn't live in California and have Coppola for a Godfather.  I did, however, live in St. Louis and had cousins who were concept illustrators at McDonnell/Douglas where the \\"Man In Space\\"  program was born.  At a family visit to their house one Sunday, they showed me an air brush illustration of men in space suits with futuristic air guns in their hands.  They said they were tasked with figuring out how guys in space suits would move around if they left a space capsule.  No one had ever seriously pondered the actual science of it.  (this was at least a year before the first Mercury Flight).  \\"Where did you get the idea?\\"  I asked.  \\"Buck Rogers\\" they said.  Illustration is the best manifestation of human creative thought and this film may have been the best of it's class.<br /><br />This BluRay should be in everyone's top ten.
B005ZC0SYQ|5.0|Excellent movie.  A True favorite.  Good movie for the horror flick fans, too.  Buy this movie for a once in a lifetime chance at seeing a movie of its kind.
1401216676|5.0|I must confess, I'm not a huge comic book reader these days and purchased this on a whim in anticipation of the next Dark Knight film. My decision was based on all the positive comments I had heard / read about this book over the years. I didn't really know what to expect prior to reading but it's safe to say that all the glowing recommendations are warranted. Put simply, it's a great read complimented by great artwork. There's a couple of nuances in the book which helps you to discover something new each time you pick it up. I particularly like the panels used to segway between the present and past lives of the Joker. The ending of the book is also thoughtful in the level of closure it provides while leaving enough questions in the minds of the reader. Highly recommended.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Its great!!!! I lovehowits time consuming and fun. Also I love how it keeps you playing because you have to unlock all the levels!!!!!!!!!!
B006MHWXMS|3.0|Its convenient and easy, but whenever you open the thing it adds a task saying &quot;Check out Tasks and Tori's app&quot; which I find really annoying. (review is for the kindle fire)
B0086700CM|5.0|this game just gets better and more fun with every upgrade that you get. would definitely reccomend this game to anyone
B0086700CM|5.0|awesome way to spend / kill some time when bored or whatever. pretty intuitive game as well. you will be addicted to it soon enough!!!
B000001FMC|5.0|Yeah, I still have the original LP, so I had to have a CD with the remixes!  You won't be dissappointed as long as the price stays low...ha!
B0076NAWWA|5.0|Flying Colors is one of my all-time favorites. Every member of this band is crucial to the overall high quality of the music. You would expect that these guys who are all ranked as \\"best-of\\"'s would have produced a muddle--as is generally the case with supergroups--but that's not what you find here.<br /><br />The music is superlative. It is obvious that the band understood the importance of creating GREAT SONGS and using their astounding musicianship to serve those compositions. This album reminds me of other song-driven vituoso collections as diverse as Yes' \\"Fragile\\", Phil Keaggy's \\"Love Broke Through\\", Tommy Emmanuel's \\"Little by Little\\", McLaughlin/DiMeola/DeLucia's \\"Guitar Trio\\", and  Bolling/Rampal's \\"Suite for Flute and Jazz Piano Trio\\".
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is exactly like the version I used to play all the time on the computer when I was little. Good work!
B00008PX8P|5.0|The sound on my 18 speaker Bose auto audio syetem is unbelivable. Of course LZ is the best and at the top of the \\"classic vinly\\" category  !!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I think it is cool because of all the things you can build the stuff and then make your world bigger.
0307891372|5.0|I have a bad memory. So when the game mentions \\"EverGreen\\" I just look it up in the index and find the whole story. If I can't figure out whether the Hammerfell guys want that lady dead for a good reason, I look up the full story in this book. This book is written with inside information from Bethesda, so even Bethesda's in game info won't tell you everything this book will.<br /><br />I don't just use this book to help me with missions. Sometimes during the mission I want more information on the mission as to why certain events are happening or whether I should go see someone else first, I consult the book. It really sucks to have to play parts of the game over because you didn't know you could talk to the Jarl first and he would send two people with you.<br /><br />Also has guides for Races, Classes, Character building, enemies you will encounter and their levels, all of that sort of thing.<br /><br />Does not have cheat codes, item lists, or any other PC codes.
B005LAIIRQ|1.0|This movie has made it into the top ten WORST movies ever. Virtually no character development and when there was it was too little too late. The director is applauding I could have directed this movie better drunk. And villianizing the wolf.....jeez THATS a brand new idea. Ugh. If you want to see a movie about real men surviving and connecting man to man I highly recommend The Brotherhood of the Wolf. Don't bother with this movie.
0545265355|5.0|After seeing \\"Mockingjay\\" in a grocery store some weeks before the Hunger games movie was due to come out I was struck by curiosity about the series and wen and bought the whole trilogy. An impulsive act but I'm glad I did because had I waited to see if I would like the first novel I would have been put through the agonizing wait of days or more (gasp!) while the second to books arrived.<br /><br />The Hunger Games trilogy is about a girl named Katniss Everdeen who lives in a post-apocalyptic America that has been divided into districts for ease with exporting. Katniss lives in district 12, which exported coal and the poorest of the districts being in former Appalachia. There Katniss is the daughter of sort of midwife who is widowed and lives in a great depression, leaving Katniss at 16 mostly responsible for the food and deposable income of the family (herself, her mother and her sister Primrose) which she gets by hunting illegally with a bow and arrow outside the fenced of district area with her friend Gabe.<br />The great horror of Panem (the new country, consisting of 12 districts and the capital city) is the hunger games a \\"tribute\\" to the fallen in a great war between the capital city and the districts some 74 years before. Every year one boy and one girl from the ages 12 to 18 is selected from each district (all are eligible and your chances of being picked go up with your age but taking food because you're poor also increases your chances) to fight to the death until one remains who is then showered with riches.<br /><br />This year Katniss's sister Primrose (Prim) is chosen as the female tribute. Katniss volunteers to take her place and promises to fight to win-but the other tribute from district 12 is the only person in the district every to  pay attention to Katniss's overwhelming poverty before she met Gabe and literally saved her life with a gift of food once. So she goes into the games feeling like she owes this Peeta Mellark.<br /><br />Survival and unexpected romance-and doing whatever it takes to appease a giant hungry, murderous audience dominate the first book. Upcoming rebellion and a love triangle dominate the second and for the third an actual rebellion and issues of identity and once again love and teenage angst.<br /><br />I truly believe the only reason these books are classified as young adult is because there is no actual sex scenes in them. In every other way they are adult books-written for I believe adults and quite libel to deeply upset children and young adults who aren't very mature readers. These are well written books that I read through each in a day and didn't want to end.<br /><br />Keep in mind before you read that it is very violent and that warning is no way held back by this books young fault status-there is just about every kind of violence there can be in these books (barring sexual-but what there is in some instances is even worse.)<br /><br />Overall each book gets 4 ½ stars and the whole series gets five
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this app is soooooo cool and VERY addictive! I totally recommend this app to all who is looking at his app! and it is very challenging! if u like a challenging game well then this is the game for u!!!
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|While Harkness's \\"A Discovery of Witches\\" was worth reading to me for the historical details and the research the author did into alchemy, in the end nothing much happened. Diana Bishop, descendant of a witch killed in Salem and a witch herself, during her research comes across an alchemical book that no one has been able to find or open for centuries. All of a sudden all three supernatural species (witches, vampires, and daemons) are after her. She finds an unlikely ally and the love of her life in Matthew Clairmont, a 1000+ years old vampire. Since romantic liaisons between species are prohibited, between that and the book, there is absolutely no shortage of creatures that want to do the couple harm.<br /><br />There are lots of side plots, villains, and the occasional burst of actions, but in the end, the story ends very much in the middle of the assorted plot lines, which I don't find very satisfying. The book could also have done with much more rigorous editing - there are long passages where the story just drags. There is rowing. There is yoga. There is a lot of wine (you get left with the feeling that the author, who also writes an award winning wine blog, could not help showing off her expertise.)<br /><br />Some parts didn't disappoint - I think what I enjoyed most was Diana Bishop's journey of discovery into her own personality, history, and abilities. I also quite enjoyed many of the side characters, especially Matthew's mother, Ysabeau. But when I had turned the last page, the book left me feeling as if I had read half a story. I would probably not recommend this to a friend unless the sequel(s) were already out and finished.
B008B7OQHM|4.0|I recently bought this album and have enjoyed it thoroughly. it has all the video/radio hits and anything else you can think of. disc 1 has 19 tracks on it  and disc 2 has 17 live tracks on it,its not a dvd its a live cd of most of their greatest hits.the outer cover of this cd is cool..its a devil mask...but for a greatest hits collection their are no band pics inside or lyrics..just a dead bird and some tools or weapons used for wrong doing and at the end someone holding the devil mask....thats it.i personally wanted alittle more for the booklet...but oh well...maybe next time.if youre a fan ....you wont be disappointed...if youre a newbie...this is where you should start or maybe iowa!enjoy.
0307949508|2.0|I enjoyed the first book but just lost interest in this one about half way through.  I found the more I knew about Salander, the less I liked her.  As many others have said, the writing is not the best, and much of that may be due to translations from Swedish.  The cast of characters are pretty good, but I think I miss the historical detective plotline of the first book.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|it is amusing enough but i have to make sure that the wifi connection is off when i am not using it otherwise my kids may buy stuff online...not good.
B00004VVNB|5.0|Very happy with my purchase. Arrived on time and is just as described. If you enjoy really good and well done science fiction, I would recommend you rent or purchase this video.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|Being the fourth book in the series it does continue to build the story further, but gives you no satisfaction in answering questions. There are a lot of new characters that are developed, which gets a little confusing because there were already so many different characters to develop. Hoping that book five answers a bit more rather than opening more questions.
B006RUJST6|5.0|Definitely one of my favorite stories!! Once I started reading I couldn't stop util I was done with book 2.
034580404X|1.0|Do not waste your precious hours of your life on these books. I kept reading thinking things would \\"pick up\\" and they did not. I was on vacation and was the only reading I had , so I suffered on. Horrible writing, boring characters, and very repetitive.  Book three was just a mockery of literature. DON'T DO IT!!! life is too short
B0073XV2W2|4.0|As a builder of combat robots and a fan of Suarez past work this book was really fun to read.  This book defines the genre of techno-thriller in my mind.  Very fast paced throughout and with great characters.
0143123173|5.0|I should have listened to my friends and read this sooner.  Walt Longmire is one of the best characters I've come across since John Sandford's Lucas Davenport.  Full of wit, mystery, snappy dialogue, intelligence and a dash of sexy I simply could not put this book down.<br /><br />Since I live smack dab in the heart of the area where this story takes place I did have a few jarring moments regarding the displacement of certain geographic features but I think Johnson can keep his poetic license.  It's really the people, not the places, that make this story so gosh darn GOOD.<br /><br />All that's needed is a pronunciation guide for everyone who is not a Wyomingite.  \\"Absaroka\\" is pronounced \\"abSORka;\\"  \\"Clearmont,\\" CLAREmont.  I know it didn't show up in this book but it might in the future.  \\"Arvada\\" is pronounced arVAYda.  There.  Now you, too, can sound like a Wyoming native.  &lt;grin><br /><br />Walt and his buddy Henry Standing Bear will have you grinning, laughing and wanting them to be YOUR new best friends.  I cannot wait to read the next book.
B008JAFXOQ|5.0|This review is for the extended version (DVD, not BluRay) and to put it simply this is a BRILLIANT FILM.  Powerful, moving, real.  Superb writing and acting.  Whoever played \\"Emily\\" the best friend of the dead woman is beyond fantastic. Both she and Anna Pacquin and the writer/director deserve a slew of awards for this film.
B000002JSN|5.0|Physical Graffiti is probably my favorite release from this band as it not only plays to the band's significant strengths, but also includes outtake material as far back as 1970(i.e. Bron-Yr-Aur and Down By the Seaside) which fuses the combo of old vs new flawlessly in its overall presentation. The exhausting, labored take of In My Time of Dying sees Zeppelin peaking within their age-old tactic of homage to Black Americana Blues interpretation as THE defining moment on the record, from one side of the coin. The other major significant number is Kashmir which remains another creative peak for the band musically with its hypnotic-like main melody and Bonham's archetypal drum rhythm attack; further heightening the number is the use of a string section and John Paul Jones' mellotron arrangement.<br /><br />In the Light has elements of a middle-eastern flavor which is eerily captured by Jones' synthesizer lines and Robert Plant's overdubbed atonal harmony vocals along with Page's main guitar lines which add to the mystique of this stirring track; further into the number there is literally light and shade in this track as the chorus melody features Jones' use of the clavinet keyboard, accentuated by Page's scale-like guitar melody intertwined. Ten Years Gone remains the ballad of the collection and lyrically recalls a long lost love, featuring a strong vocal performance from Plant, while Page multi-tracks a myriad of guitars which build this number up into dizzying heights of brillance.<br /><br />The more typical hard rock numbers displayed here in Custard Pie, The Rover(from the Houses of the Holy sessions), Night Flight(from the 71' 4th album sessions) and Sick Again offer up some strong ensemble interpetation and significant wealth of the power of Zeppelin collectively as an unbeatable unit in its own right. Trampled Underfoot and The Wanton Song are similar in tempo and also offer up some heavy boogie rock in the process; Foot in particular is driven by Jones' arresting Clavinet playing and Bonzo's pummeling drum beats. Down by the Seaside(another 4th album outtake) offers up a carefree, lazy number that seems to float along until the bridge of the track picks up speed but only for a moment before returning to the calmer outset of this fine little number. Boogie with Stu features Ian Stewart from the Rolling Stones on piano and is a treat to listen to even though its ilk is mainly of an outtake run-through, its charming to hear Zeppelin in an impromtu setting. Black Country Woman is a basic acoustic rock/blues number which again, has a sense of a laid-back nature and is a cutting/jamming type of track that is tossed out without prejudice or pretension.<br /><br />The Stones had Exile on Main St., which was a sprawling, yet captivating creative peak and so Zeppelin's Physical Graffiti can be looked upon in a similar light here; never again would both bands be able to reach these heights of creativity or the central force of power within themselves, and as such remain benchmarks of significant importance within their prospective careers. 5 Classic Stars
B007L3BMGA|3.0|A bit of escapism but not a literary masterpiece.Curiosity got the better of me and once I started I needed to know what happened next.The language used is rather full on but overall the book is an easy read.
B000002J1U|4.0|Led Zeppelin's 3rd studio offering is one of a major step within the creative fortunes of the band, and although it was regarded in its day as below the bar set by its first 2 predecessors, III is a personal favorite because of the acoustic style that was thwarted upon by Page, offering a different side of the band and proving themselves as even more of a giant talent that was capable of growing into a masterful unit of varitable musical quality. The force of Heavy Rock is toned down here, although the Immigrant Song opens up the record within a most driven quality not unlike tracks such as Whole Lotta Love or How Many More Times, for example. Celebration Day and Out on the Tiles further display the archetypal heavy Zeppelin sound which consolidates the fact that the band hadn't lost its sight of the sound that was stamped out on the prior 2 releases; meanwhile, the majestic blues vamp Since I've Been Loving You is realized as a coveted, classic Zeppelin number that features some of Jimmy's best fretboard work thus far within the confines of the studio(live it would be another sweet showcase of his inimitable talents).<br /><br />And Now for the acoustic side of things. Friends is the first number shown as the influence of songwriters like Stephen Stills and Joni Mitchell shines through with Page's use of open tunings on the acoustic arrangement given to this bluesy/folk number. Tangerine is the ballad of the record and also features Page on Pedal Steel which adds flavor to the beauty of this love ballad. Gallows Pole is another significant track which quietly builds intensely into a barnstormer of a track replete with a rollicking banjo and the powerful kit playing of Bonzo attuned to this classic folk-styled number. That's the Way would again, show the influence of the Laurel Canyon acoustic folk that was popularized at the time of Crosby, Stills and Nash, and the aforementioned singer/songwriter Joni Mitchell, whom Robert and Jimmy admired equally as much. Bron-Y-Aur Stomp is a country/folk blues vamp that is upbeat, sunny and exemplifies rollicking fun; it would also feature prominetly within the acoustic sets Zeppelin would implement within their future live shows down the road.<br /><br />III closes with a touch of Mississippi/Delta Blues style in Hats Off To (Roy) Harper which features Plant's vocal being sequenced through a harmonica Bullet microphone and what almost sounds like a Leslie Speaker for the desired \\"flange\\" effect given to his register. Page's wicked bottleneck acoustic guitar signifies the importance of this track, even if most fans think of it as nothing more than filler, but I find makes an interesting closing track to a record that sets itself apart from the first two releases and is a healthy addition to the Zeppelin catalogue as a result of its sonic difference. Though I may not grab III as frequently as Physical Graffiti, for example, its the simple fact of it being a different album altogether for the band that makes for its desired appeal. 4 Solid Stars.
0802473156|5.0|I highly recommend Gary Chapman's \\"5 Love Languages.\\" My fiance and I were almost to the breaking point for multiple reasons. This book made us pause and realize we have something worth fighting for. And it taught us how to begin on the road back. Loving each other in each person's love language has made a huge difference.
B000002JEV|4.0|This two disc set captures Zeppelin in its early stages of prominence as one of the most significant British Rock bands of its time. Disc One features performances as early as March of '69 and then 3 times during June of that year and while some tracks are repeated(You Shook Me and I Can't Quit You Baby), its interesting to hear how the performances differ and grow from a period of a few months time. The appearance of Communication Breakdown 3 times is a bit much(although this is probably due to the fact that it was a featured single from the debut album), and is a bit irritating after repeated spins and makes one wonder if there were other tracks that could have been used instead. There are a few rarities such as Eddie Cochran's Somethin Else, the Sleepy John Estes track, The Girl I Love(by which the main riff would constitute Moby Dick, Bonham's showcase) and Robert Johnson's Travelling Riverside Blues, which are a pleasure to have within the wealth of this set.<br /><br />Disc two is taken from a sole performance at London's Paris Theatre in April of '71, by which time the group would still be several months away from the release of the seminal 4th album, one gets to hear versions of Black Dog, Stairway to Heaven and Going To California in their pristine live forms. There are also versions from the III album of one of my favorite Blues homages Since I've Been Loving You, the folksy That's the Way, and the driving, propelling Immigrant Song. Dazed and Confused is updated and shows how significant the number's duration would become a tour-de-force for Jimmy Page's guitar workouts in the live performances over the next four years, leading way to the infamous violin bow schtick that attached itself to Page's growing guitar god status. Further featured are versions from the II album in Heartbreaker, an enlongated Whole Lotta Love replete with a 4 song medley including Boogie Chillin(John Lee Hooker) and Elvis' That's All Right Mama; Thank You is included and closes out the disc with a performance that is strong and noteworthy for this seldom live performed number.<br /><br />The BBC sessions is a pleasure to own for the hardcore fan base, while also can be slightly of importance to the casual fan if not for the inclusions of songs like Black Dog, What is and What Should Never Be and Stairway to Heaven. What with the limited live releases available, BBC sessions comes up wanting in a flush of major importance to the Zeppelin collector. 4 stars

B000002JSP|3.0|Recorded in Stockholm at Abba's Polar Studios in late 1978, Zeppelin's eighth studio(and last) release finds the reins being held most significantly by John Paul Jones and Robert Plant. Although Page's presence is undoubtably present and accounted for, the sounds of the group as a whole on this record, are at a much more mature and relaxed nature. Which isn't to say that the power of the group isn't still there, opening cut In the Evening being a prime example which is driven by Page's repetitive melody riff and Bonham's driving beats, but one can hear the obvious changes in the band's approach to the finished tracks chosen and overall lighter sense of ensemble perfomance and songwriting quality. Fool in the Rain has a bit of a lazy calypso-styled rhythm which is anchored by Bonham's kit playing while Robert's earnest vocal matches the song's commercial-like qualities. Jones accentuates the track during its tail end-samba flavored bridge with tack piano and caribbean timbales being used for further texture culminating in a track that is unique and fresh. South Bound Saurez is also driven by Jones' rattling, boogie piano melodies while Page offers a blistering solo during the duration of this relaxed and fun little number.<br /><br />Hot Dog features Page tackling a slight country western/boogie feel(aka chicken pickin') along with Jones providing yet again, strong boogie woogie style piano accompaniment. Plant's vocal range on this has a bit of homage to Elvis Presley in his tonality and phrasings which further add to the quirky fun of this odd, but entertaining number. The last 3 tracks in Carouselambra, All My Love and the blues-dirge I'm Gonna Crawl are driven by Jones' synthesizer arrangements and further shows an updated sound for the impending 80's decade to come. Carouselambra is the longest cut on the record, and is a personal favorite of mine as it features alot of trademark Zeppelin styles with a myriad of tempo and chord changes, as well as displaying thesonic qualities of musicianship amongst the core of the band members, esp. Jones' synth lines dominating the bulk of the track. All My Love is the ballad of the record and would also be another commercially driven track that stands out as among the most sentimental of Zeppelin's output. During the middle of the track, there is Page's layering of acoustic and electric guitars split amongst Jones' synth arrangements, while Plant's vocal is displayed at his most heartfelt and vulnerable perfomance yet. I'm Gonna Crawl hears the band returning to the blues again for inspiration, even though this number is probably one of the more weaker moments on here, this time around, the band fails to truly come up with something of sustainable substance here, despite the promise of strength throughout the variedness of the musical landscape displayed thus far, Crawl is apt in its title and perfomance.<br /><br />Door is a 3 star effort overall, but its a solid 3 star rating to my ears, as it captures a once powerful and innovative band in its ultimate twilight moment.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|I really like this book, actually. I find the characters to be interesting and believable. I like the themes and it makes me appreciate the freedom and choices I have. It's an interesting perspective this author has created. I just purchased the Kindle version of book 2, and I read the many mixed reviews, so I am looking forward to finding out for myself.
0765356139|1.0|I actually could not finish reading the book. I got to about page 450 and decided i was reading a pile of crap. Have you ever wanted every plot point to end exactly opposite what a character was trying to achieve? I swear as soon as a chacter even tried to accomplish something you could rest assured it would fail. Stop reading here if you don't want spoilers. Seriously though 400 pages of Vin having the exact same emotional issues over and over and over and over. Elend having the same problems over and over and over, every time he found a solution to a problem. Nope! It backfires and doesnt work out, did you want him to man up and finally be king? Well every time you think he will it ends in him just meekly acecpting the complete opposite of his intention. And this is after multiple times the main characters seemed to have dealth with their problems and accepted who they were. Nope sorry guys still gonna have drama. I absolutely loved the first book, and this one had so much potential, but how much depressing crap can you read before you put it down? It just gets downright frustrating. Vin and Elend need, to put it very simply, to stop freaking whining. Unbearable whining for 400 pages. What a let down, i hear the end is amazing but once SPOILER ALERT he lost his crown to penrod, i just put the god forsaken thing down.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Let's face it - this story would NEVER happen in real life. EVER. Maybe the sex part, may be the bits of it, but a 27 year old self made gazillionnaire? Please. It's good fun fluff, and I enjoyed the entertainment value of it, and I think it will be a great fluffy movie, but it completely lacks the depth that it tries so hard to create. Even the 'danger' scenes in the 3 novels don't make you wonder for a moment if everything will be ok, because it always is. There's no suspense. And the sex parts, which start out fun, become boring and unrealistic after a while. Anyway, don't expect amazing writing. But if it's summer and you are on the beach, it's good fantasy fluff.

The only drawback of it is that you can only hatch one egg at a time; and depending on the length of time for the egg to hatch determines when you can have another baby and hatch another egg.  Also when choosing to have baby it should indicate how long it will take to hatch before choosing that particular animal.

0345803485|4.0|E L James wrote a pretty good book with \\"50 Shades of Grey\\" in my opinion. Most people are harping. On the fact he mistreated her in the beginning and the in one about faced wanted her to love him but isn't this what a well written book supposed to do.. EVOKE EMOTION! Now I will agree he should have picked up a thesaurus so keep from usin words repetitively but this book does keep you on edge wondering what will happen next. The trilogy is good but \\"50 shades freed\\" was no where near as intriguing as the prior two in the series. This book wasn't about glorifying abuse. If you would read it with an open mind and finish the series you would see its about finding that one that will love you in spite of you baggage Ana did the for Christian. And in turn Ana'a love made christian realize he didn't need to live the life of a Dom to be wanted. This series is amazing and I look forward to seeing what this author will come up with next.
B005LAJ212|5.0|Revenge is the kinda show I never imagined I'd like.  I'm not a big fan of TV soaps or romance novels, but little by little I got drawn into Emily's web of intrigue and deception. I found it very satisfying watching the bad guys get a taste of their own medicine. And trust me, they deserve it. I may not really like Emily, but I really like what she does and how she does it. Can't wait for the second season.

B000QFAJ7S|2.0|*2.5 stars*<br /><br />Oh Kelly, I didn't realize you were so depressed. True, she hinted towards that notion in her 2004 breakthrough \\"Breakaway\\", but no one ever would have thought that she was in such emotional turmoil. Although, I'm guessing that a very hard break-up didn't help her. And as any hardcore Kelly fan would know, she did endure her parents divorcing when she was young. So she has grounds to be sad, but it's quite a shame that she had to bring her music down with her.<br />Starting with the album cover, with its portrayal of a lavish house being taken over by vines and leaves, and a somber Kelly looking away at the destruction, it should come as no surprise that this album will be very different than her previous two. Then again, you can probably make that inference just from the album name itself. It should also come as no surprise that the content of \\"My December\\" follows suit with the album cover. There is no light this time around, there are none of the glossy pop hits that turned Kelly into a success star, there are no indellible hooks that make you want to repeatedly listen to this set. Quite frankly, there's not a whole lot of anything here. Even though Kelly has such an incredible voice, and she took the reins of her music and co-wrote every song, she does not utilize either of those talents, even though this was supposed to be the defining moment in her career when she finally comes into her own.<br />But it didn't have to turn out like this. Kelly, I hate to say it, but you really should have listen to Clive Davis this time. Even though this album is the most personal Kelly has been with the mainstream, it's not the side that people want to listen to. But at the same time, I'll admit that this is both an artistic and personal change in sound that she needed to make. If she didn't get all of her emotions out on this CD, then her fans would have to endure multiple albums of her trying to be a hard-rock girl and singing about nothing but break-ups and depression. So it's good that she at least can acheive catharsis by expressing her thoughts. It doesn't do her career or her talents justice, but it definitely will please herself.<br />But oddly enough, \\"My December\\" isn't all doom and gloom. It's true that none, and I mean absolutely none, of the songs are happy in any way, but not all of the music reflects that. Most of the time she has a good track to work with, but then pairs it up with pretentious lyrics that lose all of their depth. The best moments on \\"My December\\" come when Kelly is not trying to brighten up the album, when she just goes with the flow and sings like a depressed teenager. These include the lead single \\"Never Again\\", \\"Sober\\", and the double feature of \\"Irvine\\" and \\"Chivas\\". Surprisingly, the last two songs are the best on the entire album.<br />All in all, \\"My December\\" is not an overly enjoyable listen. It does just enough to keep you interested, but most of the songs will not resonate past their playing time. And it's quite frustrating that on an album that Kelly spent so much time working on and defending, she displays her weakest vocals to date and does not emote nearly enough to make \\"My December\\" worth all of that trouble. She wanted this album to be comparable to \\"Evanescence\\", but it ends up sounding like a tiring and dry version of Avril Lavigne's \\"Under My Skin\\". However, the bright side of this dark album, is now that Kelly has aired her dirty laundry, a much better album surely awaits.

B001DF68MA|5.0|This is the best child bike seat I've come across.  My son is currently 17 mos old, 27 lbs and about 28\\" tall and he fits pretty much perfectly in it with the foot bins all the way down.  Given the fit, I'm not sure how it'll go next summer, but that's not the seat's fault.  My son loves riding with me, he often asks for \\"bike\\".  I like this seat because he sits in front and I can keep an eye on him and talk to him easily.  I'm 6' tall and have no problems leaning over him on my mountain bike.  Also, I must pedal slightly out of alignment, b/c my right knee will sometimes rub the back of the seat.  Overall though the seat doesn't really impact my riding style and having him sit in front helps keep the balance of the bike.  The exposed portion of neck on my front stem where the mounting bar connects is about as short as it gets and I was still able to mount it.  I almost didn't order this seat because I didn't think I'd be able to mount it, but glad I did, so definitely give it a try even if your stem is short.  Hopefully my little guy will still fit in it next summer, but if not we'll have gotten our money's worth this year at least.<br /><br />Just as a side note: according to the website this LTD model includes an oversized buckle for the harness straps, mine seems to have come with the standard buckle.  The pics on Amazon don't even show the oversized buckle and if you look at the customer pics, some have it and some do not.  The bigger buckle would be nice and probably easier to snap together, but I've had no real issues with the \\"regular\\" buckle.  The other differences between the LTD and regular is that the seat cushions are thicker and the shoulder straps come with pads.  I must have been lucky, I got this seat direct from Amazon for the same price as the non-LTD regular WeeRide.  Otherwise, given the price and feature differences, I probably would have gone with the regular model for the $25 it would have cost to \\"upgrade\\".

030758836X|5.0|I have read the author's last 2 books and was totally engrossed in them, especially Sharp Objects.  Gone Girl, the author's newest book, with it's many twists and turns, did not let me down. Every time I thought I knew what was going on, the author added another twist.  I would have liked a more explosive ending, but the ending as written was probably the best one for the book, because it gave me chills as well as plenty to ponder and digest.  I would advise you to read this author's books before you hear someone discussing the books or before you read a review that tells you too much.

0486268659|5.0|More than sixty years ago I read my first book by Charles Dickens: A Christmas Carol. Mesmerized by the three ghosts, the stinginess of Ebenezer Scrooge, and the frailty of Tiny Tim, I kept the book beside my bed, tucked under the lamp on the night stand close at hand in the family home in Iowa.  When the situation seemed unbearable within the walls where the family quarreled daily, I would read it, and imagine myself freed from the hatred around me.<br /><br />When I began teaching at a small rural Iowa college. I risked everything to introduce A Christmas Carol to my students as representative of 19th century England: the work houses, the potato famine and hunger, the miserliness of those with financial means to stay aloof from the ever-increasing poor. Reading Dickens' Christmas Carol enabled many to discover that life had not changed that much.  At night, when I would return to my small apartment on the second floor of an old wooden house, buffeted by harsh winds and empty space, prepared a cup of potato soup or wheat gruel for supper, I began to feel myself to be an ever increasing part of Dickens' tale.<br /><br />Later when I taught at major universities in the USA and abroad, the Dickens classic was my constant companion. When I taught English history or English literature it was required reading.  Discussions turned to interpretation and the book's relationship to the present clime and time: we went through the counting houses of banks, the dark alleys where the gin-soaked poor brought stolen goods to those who would resell, and the holes where prostitutes earned a scant living, much as occurs today. Of course I encouraged my students to also read Hard Times, Oliver Twist and other Dickens classics to discover the misery of the Industrial Age and the scorn the rich had for the poor, outsourcing jobs, lending money at usurious rates, and the calloused treatment of employees. Things had not changed much, and personal choice was only for the wealthy who counted for about 1% of the people.<br /><br />At sixty I moved to one of the poorest, most heavily impoverished nations where crime is a daily routine, education at best a joke, and plagiarism expected and condoned by teachers at all levels. In 2007, after Antonio Chang enforced the law to test all teachers in Peru, when I learned that only 151 out of more than 185,000 teachers who were tested for basic compentency had passed, I offered to teach the teachers. My first book of choice was A Christmas Carol as it covers every art and literary aspect of dialogue and education. I am still teaching the teachers--the few who allow me the honor, while most prefer to stay at home or travel to a second and/or third school to teach for additional income.  I am still using Charles Dickens' stellar work. I pull out my weathered copy of A Christmas Carol and read it to my students and collegues, and then show the George C. Scott rendition of the classic that is now on DVD and fortunately is available at Amazon.com. Several students swiftly see the similarity between 19th century London and contemporary Peru where survival remains the primary goal and the only source of hope was within the walls of churches. Unfortunately the 1% of Peru who own the means of production and wealth have not yet met the Ghost of Christmas Past and the clergy they sit in front of like marble statues are more like Dostoyovsky's Grand Inquistor in his classic The Brothers Karamazov than the pastor in Dickens' Christmas Carol.<br /><br />A Christmas Carol is mandatory reading in my English classes. Passing any course I teach requires a demonstrative ability to show the relevance of the Dickens' classic about Ebeneezer Scrooge to the twenty-first century elites who still rule over lives and destinies.<br /><br />Today the students at my university in the north of Peru, are working to help the very poor nestled on a small hill in front of the great gates to this privately-owned center of learning to plan for running water and a sewer, to go to school, to look for better jobs, and improve their lot in life. The wasteland that many have moved to in order to escape the depression in the mountains is but a mirror of the rampant poverty of the shanties surrounding Lima, but in each case A Christmas Carol's presentation of the poor districtions of London are easily understood by the poor of Peru, and Ebeneezer's epiphany is readily known and hoped for as a better future for all.  Peru has a long way to go before it will climb out of the abyss it is in because of a too-long history of rule by dictators and teachers who occupied classrooms for the limited money but without any skills to impart knowledge, A Christmas Carol gives hope to those who seek a better life, and the Ghost of Christmas past still has its finger pointing at marked graves at those who have no charity, no compassion,no sense of feeling.  Dickens' tale will help change that and I will teach it as long as there is breath in this old body.
B005LAIHXQ|1.0|If you're teetering with the decision to buy Prometheus then ask yourself one blatantly obvious question: Why is it there are SO many reviewers saying people walked out on this film and yet others are claiming it was brilliant? It makes you wonder who the positive reviewers are; maybe they've got a stake in the proceeds? The simple truth is Scott missed the mark...Period! Shame on YOU Scott for taking such ridiculous chances and veering so far from a plausible story we were all expecting! I've been a true fan of the franchise since seeing the original in the theaters and was SO excited about this movie; I even bought the new Blu-ray pack with hours and hours of extra footage just to catch any extra \\"production secrets\\" about plot and character development. Mind you, I'm not some die-hard fanatic that believes a story MUST stay within certain rigid parameters. The simple truth is sometimes less is more and trying to cram too much into Prometheus just made it a mess. There was NO depth as others are claiming, trying desperately to appear as intellectuals as though the rest of us didn't catch some brilliant thread of a concept; you'll get more inspiration to our origins watching Ancient Aliens on TV. This is the first review I've ever taken my time to write because I rely on objective reviews when purchasing from Amazon and I felt SO deprived with Prometheus, I just had to share it with other Alien fans. If you look at the trend over the past couple of years, it was one of \\"beginning origin\\" films. Star Trek, X-Men, Planet of the Apes all created great movies showing us HOW the characters all came about and it was fun to see them develop, especially Star Trek; however, Prometheus was an attempt to somehow beat the others not only to show how the Alien creature came about, but also to explain Man's creation as well. It was just awful; even if you aren't an Alien fan, it was not a good movie; it was long and drawn out and even the scary/suspenseful parts were weak. WhenI saw Prometheus, MANY people walked out on it; I even considered it several times, but I stayed HOPING something would turn it around! What a let down. All the hoopla before the release of this film tried to make Scott appear as a movie making \\"God\\" now it just looks ridiculous. My belief is take creative liberties on a NEW film, not a proven franchise. I HOPE Scott realizes the mistakes he made and doesn't take such chances on the next film that hopefully bridges the gap between this film and the first Alien movie. In short, save your money; it's not even worth renting.
0375413405|4.0|I have this book out from the library ,trying to decide to purchase or not.  This edition is obviously about half the size of the original book, no bread recipes, a bit disappointed in that.  It is updated with info on food processors but I think common sense would tell you when you could use a processor or mixer instead of doing certain things by hand.<br /><br />I made the ham and potato gratin on p. 153.  Was leary of doing it ahead, even tho it said you could, the top layer of potatoes did turn gray--yuk.  Tasted good, but I put double the amount of ham.  1/2 cup for 4 people just didn't seem enough.<br /><br />In general, I think you need to keep these recipes in perspective as far as adapting them to american portions vs. french portions.  Not that we can't stand to cut down on portions but I never would serve the above recipe to 4 people as a main dish unless I had several other courses, more like how the french do.<br /><br />I did so much reading about how Julia came about doing the cookbook that I almost feel guilty NOT buying it.  I've done a few recipes in the book so far.  One thing I did as far as remembering the techniques was get her videos from the library and took notes.  You really need to see alot of this rather than trying to figure it out from drawings , in my opinion.<br /><br />Desserts a bit disappointing because they almost all use alcohol of some kind, which I don't use, especially rum, hate the taste, but doesn't give alternatives.<br /><br />I am a big Julia fan so I may end up buying the book.  I had volume 2 of the original set out and I know a recipe I wanted to try, in the middle , referred you to volume 1.  Well, I don't want to have 2 books out to do one recipe, so maybe this shorter version is better in that respect.

031620157X|4.0|This book is actually very interesting and clearly thought out in all it's dimensions. I think the only reason that I didn't rate it 5 stars is that there are clear portions of the book where you can tell that Chris Colfer is writing his first book. This can be found in parts where he overly explains someone's appearance but then does an entire fight scene in a sentence or two with little elaboration and imagery. However, all in all it's a very good book and as long as you don't get nit picky the author did a very good job.

B0068FZ0PG|5.0|I had forgotten what a great movie this was.  My husband and I watched it together and both agreed it is a feel-good movie about baseball and the people who love it and never stop believing that miracles are possible.  Although not a true story, after watching it, you will wish it were.
0811879542|5.0|I regularly pick up books at the library to keep a rotating selection of stories for my 3 year old grand children (boy and girl).After a week or two they are ready for something different.  But this book was a true find.  I brought it home not sure if they would get it or enjoy it.  It is their favorite, they had to share it with everyone who came to the house from mom and dad to a friend who stopped by.  I lost count how many times they read it the first day alone.  This is one I am buying to keep in my home and one I will be giving for gifts this holiday season.
B008GXHOFW|1.0|can compete the down load., even after removing all of my apps. i want a refund. all it keep say is 32mb then 43mb.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Amazing book. Can´t wait for the rest of the trilogy! Well written, no words wasted. Congratulations to the writer, you really wrote a classic!
B006P0FIB0|2.0|The DVD is locking up and I have to skip over the spots it stops at to get the movie going again. The delivery of it was fast though it just doesn't work well.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|Goofy sorry, but good controls and good puzzles. luckily you can skip the mini puzzles. They don't work well. Will finish today.
0823016714|3.0|Not quite sure what I was expecting.<br /><br />It's a good book if you're bad with thinking of expressions. But as many others said, the expressions are the \\"traditional\\" or what I'd call muted/subtle expressions of traditional artists. It's great for cartoonists and anyone looking for a handy reference book.<br /><br />What i love is that it's got around 4 pages each of the same person, doing different expressions, or just the same expression from many different angels. And in the beginning it's got a few reference shots of the skull, in the  back it contains some headgear photographs, and throughout there's some cute artist's representations in the form of caricatures.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say it was a great reference  book. Definitely worth the price. Just not the most exciting piece of art reference material to look at.
B008ASLNN2|3.0|I rented this last night, excited about finally getting to see it.  I found myself wondering when it would end. I absolutely love the dynamic between RDJ and Jude Law, but this movie falls flat everywhere else. I don't think Moriarty was at all interesting.  He's supposed to be an evil genius, right? He had none of the villainous intrigue that Mark Strong had in the first movie.<br />Overall, I would rent it if you loved the first one, but definitely wait for it to be on special.
0061537934|1.0|I bought this book after reading and enjoying Bruce Cameron's books, A Dog's Purpose and A Dog's Journey.  Thinking this book would offer more of the same joy, I was sorely disappointed.  Enzo the dog was a mouthpiece for the author and completely unlike any dog ever created.  I am not a fan of auto racing but was willing to give it a try anyway because of the good reviews by so many dog lovers.  I stayed with it until the owner, Denny, hauled off and hit his dog in the head.  No matter what the reason, that is abuse in my mind.  I have never written a review of a book that I haven't finished, but I made an exception for this book, hoping I could warn off other readers that might share my feelings.
B007Z9QWVK|5.0|I'm partially surprised by the harsh criticism \\"W.E.\\" has received, but it's clear that people are critiquing the film's director rather than the actual film. I am not a huge Madonna fan and wanted to see this movie only because of my interest in Wallis Simpson.  I did not expect an historical retrospective, which this fim is not, but I also didn't expect the beautifully-crafted and expertly-acted film I watched. This is truly a beautiful film, with solid parallel stories, incredible costumes and, as mentioned, spot-on, wonderful acting. The two stories being played out were complex & compelling and the scenery and costumes were amazing, with no detail left unattended. I know Madonna only does projects for vanity purposes but she did a fantastic job on \\"W.E.\\" and I hope she plans on directing more films, considering this is only her second directing effort.
B007HO392S|5.0|Love the album, almost every song is good. Some are very deep and thought provoking and some are just good fun. Highly recommended.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|this game was awesome I finished it in a day and a half because I was obsessed. great totally worth price
0345803485|5.0|Great book. Easy read. Very enjoyable. Once I started reading, I didn't want to stop. I'll definitely be reading this trilogy again.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|I love this app. it teaches you classical songs and songs you already know. it shows you step by step as well.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is cool. thenonly thing isee thatvwould make it better is to have more help.....its sooo cool. and thenkobs are simple aand easy to do.
034580404X|5.0|There would be nothing worse than finishing late and not having time to get the next one until the next day! Think ahaead and buy the trilogy set together, your going to end up reading them all anyway and for this cost you cant pass it up
B008KP6ENE|3.0|jack is a liar from wat I know but I think it takes too much memory... but great grafics and fun characters so this game is good
B003WUYOQ6|4.0|Taubes makes a convincing argument that is very well documented and backed by sound science, for how carbohydrates and specifically starches and sugars result in hormonal imbalances leading to obesity and other diseases. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants meticulous, scientific coverage of the subject of obesity, nutrition, and human biology. Not only does he make a sound argument in favor of his position but shows with ample scientific evidence that the low-fat, plant-based diets we are all told to eat are bunk.<br /><br />While this book is quite excellent, I must bump it one star for the rather non-scientific way in which his sources are cited. As a scientist myself I expect specific references to the primary literature and easy access to those citations, e.g. via endnotes or footnotes. Instead, all the sources are itemized in a single chapter at the end, listed by chapter used. Without endnotes, it is difficult to specifically associate each claim he makes with a particular source. Nevertheless, the sources are there and are valid, and the book is very well researched. I highly recommend the book.
B007SGM084|5.0|The trilogy is just mouthwatering. Very intriguing, I couldn't put it down once I've started reading them. I was glad I got the three books at once too, because I don't think I'd be able to wait for the next one. I'm already considering reading them again. i usually do that once I've fallen in love with a book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am always on the search for new science fiction writers, and finding Hugh Howley is going to go down as a huge coup.  In the question-and-answer section at the end of \\"Wool\\", he refers to himself as a big fat nobody, but this isn't going to remain the case for long.<br /><br />I absolutely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys science fiction.  And be prepared to have a very distracted few days until you finish it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app it has lots of fifteenth levels you need to pass and I like how u don't need wifi.
B000286S8S|5.0|One of the last really good old rock and roll albums! It's a must have...even if you've never heard Van Halen before...every hit is here!
0316017922|5.0|Great book for anyone who loves to see accepted paradigms shattered.  Well written with very interesting examples.  The biggest surprise is the epilogue!
034580404X|5.0|These books were awesome. They arrived in perfect condition. I would recommend these books to all women. They are excellent. I will definitely read them again.
B001BR7CZW|5.0|This movie is a timeless classic of the original Blues Brothers.<br />This DVD has the original cast representing Jake and Elwood.<br />The various cast of actors who were in retirement or had not been seen<br />in movies for a while are a pleasant surprize as pop-in characters.<br />Great movie.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a great book, first person perspective in the present tense, which is difficult as is, yet very well done
B004SEUJKU|5.0|I love this movie every part great movie a must<br />Have in every blu ray collection<br />I am a huge Arnold fan and he nailed this part down perfect
B006LSZECO|5.0|The \\"Cool Girl\\" rant in the middle of the book just flat out rocks.<br /><br />Gillian Flynn is an amazing writer...I've just gotta get this out there, though: I would be frightened if I were married to her.
B005COO1X6|2.0|Lifelong King fan, and loved the story but I think the publisher should be ashamed because they obviously were trying to generate customers for his next book. This download has more pages of excerpts from the upcoming than what you are buying it for, Mile 81. You don't have to sell me on King, just don't rip me off.
B007SNMYNS|4.0|If you are truly interested in losing weight and improving your health, this may be the book for you. When you banish wheat from your diet you become aware of just how prevalent wheat is in the North American diet. The wheat free regime outlined in the book, while the essential strategy, is not the whole story. Weight loss should happen to some extent just with the elimination of wheat, but to get better results one must avoid replacing wheat carbohydrates with carbohydrates from sugars and other starchy foods. This is essentially a low carb diet with a twist. The book gets extremely technical regarding food and body chemistry in places but the central message is clear. In three weeks I have lost six pounds. If you are serious about changing your weight and your life, get the book and give it a try. You will never look at a donut the same way again.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Game is fun to play, though habit forming - which for some can be an issue.  If this is an issue for you, think again before down loading :-)
B004YEZBW0|4.0|This is a review of the Blu-ray set, not the movie. The movie is fantastic on every level, and I think most people know that.<br /><br />What's included:<br /><br />-Blu-ray Version (with bonus features)<br />-DVD version<br />-Digital Copy Code<br /><br />Bluray: 4 Stars<br /><br />The Blu-ray disc included is the same as the first Blu-ray release of the film. The picture quality is good but not fantastic. Out of all the Harry Potter Blu-rays this one looks the worst (but that's understandable considering its age). Some less than impressive CGI effects become more apparent due to the picture upgrade. The sound quality is fantastic all around when played on my home theater system. All in all the picture and sound are MUCH better than the DVD version for sure and are worth the price.<br /><br />Extras: 2 1/2 Stars<br /><br />The bonus features is where this edition falls flat and really shows that it's not for hardcore fans. Most of the features are just clips extrapolated from the movie and not really anything new. Also worth mentioning is the lackluster menu which is just a screenshot from the movie with the selections completely covering it.<br /><br />The list below will describe all of the extras...<br /><br />+ Additional Scenes - You get 7 deleted scenes. Good extra, we appreciate it.<br /><br />+ Capturing the Stone - A 15 or so minute feature of the director and producer explaining the process of bringing the novel to the big screen. Best of the so called \\"features\\", quite interesting.<br /><br />+ Around the World Multilanguage Clip - Basically a scene that you can play in several different languages, kinda pointless.<br /><br />+ Ghosts of Hogwarts - A brief clip of the ghosts in the movie with a narrator introducing each of them. Again, pointless.<br /><br />+ Yearbook Character Clips - This feature takes you to a menu that lets you pick from several different characters, once you select one you see a montage of clips from the movie showing their personality. If you watched the movie once, this isn't worth looking at.<br /><br />+ Lessons in Quidditch - The clip from the movie where Wood explains Quidditch to Harry with some scenes from the Quidditch match. Useless.<br /><br />+ What It Takes to Hatch a Dragon Egg - The clip where Hagrid's dragon hatches with a narrator explaining how it works. Slightly interesting, but still USELESS.<br /><br />+ Theatrical and Teaser Trailers - Do I need to explain this?<br /><br />DVD: 4 1/2 Stars<br /><br />There's not much to say here. It's the DVD version, it gets the job done. It somehow manages to have a better menu than the Blu-ray version too. No extras except Cast & Crew Bios and Trailers.<br /><br />Digital Copy: 4 1/2 Stars<br /><br />Again, not a lot to say. You download a program from the link they give you and enter your code to download the movie. The program is a little hard to install sometimes but usually works fine. You can pick either a Windows Media Player or iTunes digital copy to download, which is nice. The quality of the digital copy is decent, about the same as the DVD version.<br /><br />Packaging: 4 1/2 Stars<br /><br />The new cover artwork is a nice touch for this series of Blu-ray Combo Packs. I do wish they had slip cases for these releases but it's not a big deal.<br /><br />Overall: 4 Stars ****<br /><br />Like I said this is more for the casual fan who wants to be able to watch the movie almost anywhere. Hardcore fans I'd suggest looking at the Ultimate edition. If you are interested in this edition I'd suggest getting it at Target rather than Amazon if you want a better deal.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|There seems to be such conflicting reviews of this series. I guess all you can say is that writing is subjective. Who can really truly say what is a good book and what isn't? We can only give our personal opinions. I enjoyed this series but this book was probably my least favorite. We ended Book 2 waiting to see what Jack Hyde was going to do but started Book 3 with the wedding and the honeymoon. I found myself wanting to speed thru those parts just to get to the part when Jack would come back into the picture. Once that part came I was happy with the rest of the storyline. I would say the following about these books:<br /><br />1. What woman actually gets thru her day on diet cokes and lattes. Her lack of eating really got annoying to me.<br />2. The sex did get repetitive....same use of key phrases that got a little old. Would have actually preferred more of a story on Jack Hyde and less on the constant sex.<br />3. The end of the book with the different pespective from Christian as a child and from when he met Ana was not interesting to me.<br /><br />All in all I did enjoy the series and I know there are people that feel it demeans women and that Christian is a horrible excuse for a man in the sense that he is over controlling and abusive. I just detached myself from over analyzing that part of it and enjoyed it for what it is.....fiction.
B003UESJEM|4.0|Down sizieing america, this movie reflects our situation as a country of these trying times, people losing their jobs and more. The best reason to watch this is for the performances, not that the movie is bad it's not it's a very good movie just a tough story. Never give up things could always be worse. Good for perserverence.<br />Scott M
B008JGSM6G|5.0|One of the best free games, that deosent require an Internet connection to function, that you can get. And it is easy too
B007RP4D5Y|5.0|this will be a classic. the sax changes everything in a cool way for an aggressive jazz album. it all works quite well. a very interesting well produced jam.bravo pat and company
0374249512|5.0|Having never heard of Fred Ulhman, I was first intrigued by the foreword by Arthur Koestler, who called it a minor masterpiece - a description in which I wholely concur. In novella form, not much longer than a short story (only 100 pages), it describes the close friendship and subsequent alienation of two young boys, one a Jew, the other an aristocrat, during one of the pre-war years in Germany at the time of the rise of Hitler and his Nazi followers. It is beautifully written, although English is not the native tongue of Ulhman, a German Jew who was living in England at the time this was written. One has the feeling that this book is almost autobiographical.
B007SGM084|4.0|Honestly this book is terribly written but overal they are really good books. There's going to be another baby boom with all the ladies reading these lol
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Contains the option to include multiple alarms that go off at certain days of the week, to label each individual alarm, and to set reminders. I especially the like options to wake up to any music I have stored on my Kindle, which can be played by album, artist, or your own customized playlist! This app is free and I would recommend it to everyone!
B003ZJ70W4|1.0|Groaning, embarrassingly awful, makes-you-want-to-crawl-under-your-seat bad. The only reason I watched it to the end was that I couldn't believe anything could be as repulsive, tasteless, and devoid of value as this movie was...and I was on a long distance trans-Pacific flight...and I had exhausted my other entertainment options...including those in un-subtitled Chinese. The plotting is stupid, the acting stinks, and the conduct is contextually inappropriate in the extreme. I just love it (not) when a character finally upsets the local males enough that they begin to confront her. NOT a funny moment when it happens in real life, folks. As my seat mate observed, the movie is so bad you can find yourself rooting for some good old fashioned sexual repression. It's not that you want to see the people associated with this dreck flogged, but it really is junk and I hope this ends the franchise. It would give the thing a purpose.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It was great. Very intertaining .I feel like I know all the characters in the book. When you think it can' t get anymore intertaining you find out there is two more follow up books on the story line. Loved the books. Barbara P.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|I very much enjoyed both Rebecca Hamilton's writing style and the well-crafted fantasy world she has put together in this debut novel.  The description is crisp and vivid, drawing clear images of the small mountain town where most of the story takes place.  The main character Sophia has a consistent, enjoyable voice that is sometimes witty but avoids being overly snarky, while also having enough vulnerability to make the reader feel sympathy for her.  There's plenty of spooky action throughout, along with an original and fascinating cast of mythical creatures that goes far beyond the usual vampire story.  The author put a lot of thought into creating a complex fantasy realm in which there is more to discover on every page, and the storyline fits together impressively well.<br /><br />The romance builds slowly, but its pace suits Sophia's defensiveness and awkward innocence.  Midway through the story there's a sudden plot twist that is very effective; without posting any spoilers, I'll say that I never saw it coming, and the story segues smoothly into another character's perspective with some historical background too.  It's not easy for a writer to pull that off effectively.  The fast-paced ending builds up the creepiness level so much that, for the last few chapters, the book just can't be put down!  Looking forward to more from this author.

B00338QENI|5.0|I started reading this book out of curiosity because my son is being required to read it for college 101. After hearing the professor talk about the book, I decided to read it for myself. I am so glad that I did. The book is based on real life events and it tells how the doctors used a woman's cells to do research. I smiled and I cried, as I read this book, to learn that the famiy had no idea of what was being done and also to learn of the many advances doctors have been made to help create new vaccines and do research into finding cures for diseases.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in science or someone who wants to read a book that they can really enjoy. It really would be good for a book club to read and discuss.<br />[[ASIN:1400052181 The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks]]
B00428ZRFE|4.0|I like this album but find myself wishing the song writing was better in a few of the songs.  Besides that I would buy this CD again for a gift.

0374275637|3.0|This book was recommended to me by a mathematically inclined student who is very good at formalism as it connects to the \\"real world.\\" He wanted to apply notions from Michael Lewis' \\"Moneyball\\" to other sports.  After just reading \\"Moneyball,\\" I agree.  These two books are a nice complement and useful for a quantitative person to think about how human psychology influences the decision-making process.  For me, a quantitative type in science and technology, the book gave useful insights.  Most of his results were plausible and nicely synthesized.  If you like, he presents a rational way to deal with irrationality.  More to the point, he also gave a credible case for behavioral economics which will give me cause to pause when considering future comments from the rational school.<br /><br />For kicks, I also read a few of the one-star reviews here on Amazon.  Their criticism has some validity.  I found myself on board with the author's thesis relatively early, and found much of the accumulating evidence for \\"Type 1\\" versus \\"Type 2\\" behavior to be redundant.  As for style, the author was quite polished in how well he praised his many colleagues, all of whom seemed to be at fine institutions in desirable socio-economic locations doing charming work, all of which is likely a useful skill in obtaining a Nobel prize, of which we read often.
B0073PPKNM|5.0|Soft and sultry - Melody Gardot does not disappoint!  A little Latin rhythm and some old fashioned jazz inspiration goes a long way!
0393338398|4.0|Michael Lewis is a national treasure.  He thinks in an original way on a wide variety of topics, and then puts it in print in a readable way.  He has illuminated complex topics for me in many books, and has done so again in Moneyball.  In high school in the 1970s, my friends and I played a lot of \\"Superstar Baseball\\", a board game with complicated dice which lent itself to statistical analysis.  We were surprised that the real life statistics of the players represented did not always match well with that of the board game, and many of us took advantage of that in constructing our teams.  This is basically what Billy Beane, the main character of the book, is shown to do.  Lewis is most passionate in his defense of statistics against \\"experts\\" with received wisdom whose wisdom is generally inconsistent with data and uninformed by an understanding of probability theory.  I read this just after Daniel Kahneman's \\"Thinking, Fast and Slow\\", and the two books complement each other nicely.  Kanheman's thesis is, in condensed version, that we use our reflexive instincts to make too many decisions, to our detriment.  He backs it up with data and a recent Nobel Prize.  Lewis' book appears to be a prime example demonstrating this thesis.  My only reason for 4 stars is that at times I found the writing style a little jumpy, but this is a small criticism.
030758836X|1.0|If an author can't think of a way to conclude a book, they shouldn't start it.  Despite the nastiness of most the characters in this book, I found myself interested, pulled along by the plot.  But if a plot comes dead end into a brick wall, it's hard to respond in any way except perhaps with profanity.  If the author plans a Part 2, that should be made evident, so that you can decide whether you want to devote the time to characters as despicable as these.
B0006GAO5Y|4.0|Somehow I managed to see parts III and IV and recently V many times but never II and I.  So I watched them backwards...II, then I.  Ooooooh, Sly in this film just made me SWOON.It wasn't even the story line, though that was fine.  It was the relationship with Adrian...he was SO sweet with her and liked her so much...sigh. :) And except for the hair, he was pretty hot in his own way back then...still is! He was just so charming, and watching them fall in love...so well done.  Good acting from a man who gets made fun of a lot.  The Academy didn't think he was so bad!!!  I know I'm not focusing on what I am supposed to focus on, but who cares? That's what I took from it and that's what I really enjoyed. Their marriage and pregnancy in Part II is almost as sweet and cute, by the way.
B004EPZ07U|5.0|the product itself was in perfect condition, so for that reason im giving this five stars.<br />the movie was pretty good, but the soundtrack was not what i would have chosen if i wanted the movie to be taken seriously. your children will most likely love the movie, because there is lots of colors, cool effects, and superheroes. it was fun to watch and overall im glad i purchased it to add to my hero collection, plus the price was really affordable.

Not one person who claims it is so great has made a video from the box to finish balancing this product... that is because you cannot do that...<br />It is terrible and if you purchase it you will wish you followed my advice and not purchased it.<br />All the youtube videos are \\"showing it in action\\" not actually balancing it... that one guy who is link here in a few comments is a faker! He does not balance that one from beginning to end!<br />It is terrible that this product has one thing in common ... everyone of the fakers stating how it was so easy to balance -- simple not true and as page two states -- it may take hundreds!!!! of adjustments...<br />If, you still purchase this product then you have no one but yourself to blame for the fees on sending it back as you will NOT be able to make a video showing how you balanced this with ease and how I am wrong...
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This app is quite handy for many reasons.<br /><br />Good things: you can bookmark, you can highlight, it holds your place if you exit out, the search option is quite advanced, switching between books and chapters is very easy, MANY different versions of the Bible, available without wifi, has different reading plans you can use.<br /><br />Bad things: you cant highlight certain sentences,  you can only highlight the whole entire verse which is very annoying in the Message Version because there are 1-5 verses combined together.<br /><br />Altogether this app is very nice and easy to use,  I just wish we could highlight specific things instead of whole verses at a time.
B008MEM24S|5.0|my little boy likes this, so it gets 5 stars! anything perry is good. this is well done, and pretty much just like 'where's my water' so it's entertaining and easy to use thanks! well worth the 99 cents we paid for it!!
