0375758992|5.0|A fascinating story of a childhood in Africa--Rhodesia during its civil war, Malawi and Zambia.  The daughter of farmers, Fuller remembers the good and the bad, the bugs and the beauty, the worms and the drinking.  I feel that the author and her sister grew up in spite of their parents.  A great read, but does not entice me to visit Africa.
B000MZHW40|5.0|My only critique is Jennifer Connolly was limp as a dishrag.    Otherwise, SUPER performances from Di Caprio and Honsou, and the scenery (actually Mozambique) is a character in its own right. Gritty, moving, and Di Caprio really is able to show his range and talent (which I think is still underestimated by many just because he started off as a soap star).      Hounsou is great. And Vosloo as the villain, perfect. Wonderful action adventure film with deeper meaning, plus the power of love. A sparkling gem.
B001R10BEG|4.0|This is a great movie, but to put the line \\"Hanks has never been better\\" on the cover is a terrible insult to an actor who's done ENORMOUS things since then.    Other than that, a great flick with a superb transfer. And at the time of writing this, the price is just right!
B000687M48|3.0|The package includes a DVD and a CD.  The DVD that is included is great as you can see the tremendous effort the band puts forth, and the 5.1 Dolby Digital made up for a lot of recording deficiencies.  The special features were wonderful and include a couple of very nice videos.   The CD's recording however was just awful, it sounds like it was recorded from the fourth row with a Mr. microphone
B00004VVNB|5.0|This movie, while being pre-Star Wars, is still relevant today in the subject matter; ecology, overpopulation, hedonism, governmental control, technologies, marriage, genocide, and many others with very plausible visual depictions of a future \\"post-apocalyptic\\" society. The movie's varied subject matter is presented very well in the plot, and really...relatively simple dialogue. The actors are all very believable, yet simple. Some may say that this movie is overly simplistic, shallow, etc, but...and that is a big BUT...when you consider what the movie presents you see great depth. It should be considered a CLASSIC and rated with equal prestige as great literary works like Ray Bradbury's \\"Farenheit 451\\" or George Orwell's \\"Animal Farm\\"
B002436WJE|3.0|Were it not for the fact that Liam Neeson is in the starring role in Taken, this film from French action/trash producer Luc Besson (The Transporter series, The Fifth Element) wouldn't really be too worthwhile otherwise.  Having an actor of Neeson's stature lends a certain degree of credibility that Taken wouldn't oterwise have, and that alone makes the film worth seeing.  Neeson stars as Bryan Mills, an ex-spy trying to reconcile his estranged relationship with his teen daughter Kim (Maggie Grace).  When Kim goes to Paris with a friend, and subsequently gets kidnapped, Bryan springs into action to save her, and breaks many bones along the way.  There are some genuine surprising moments to be found in Taken, amidst the gaping plot holes, leaps in logic, and overall incoherency.  Still, Neeson is magnetic here, and as said before, had Taken starred a lesser actor, the film would be all the worse for it.  All in all, fans of flashy action will get a kick out of Taken to be sure, but for the rest of us, the film is worth seeing for Neeson alone.

B001UREJWM|4.0|The best thing about the new Heaven and Hell CD \\"The Devil You Know\\" is that there is not one blessed thing 2009 about it. I don't mean that as an insult either.    From the campy 80's metal cover art to the 10 track listing that seems utterly trapped in a Side One/Side Two, LP format... to Dio's unending stream of Dungeons & Dragons lyrics... There is nothing modern about this CD... and that is why I love it.    There is no denying the talent here, the direction. This record is so F'ing heavy, and not in the modern sense of all of these players that shred like they get paid a dollar a note... The music on \\"The Devil You Know\\" is outstanding. Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, Vinny Appice and RJ Dio simply crush everyting in thier way with a sledgehammer of riff's and unrelnting power... music changes and people beg, borrow, and steal what they like from the best, but no one makes music like this anymore.    This CD could have come out anywhere between 1975 and 1995 and it would have seemed right at home. I just hope the guys continue to enjoy the union and that a tour and new album are already on their minds...     This record may not be what some of you wanted but it sure is what rock needs a bit more of.

B00011F5DK|5.0|This is a logical thinking game, a strategic game which is most easily won if one thinks ahead two or even three steps.<br /><br />It is the type of game that can easily be understood and easily played but to actually win can be difficult.<br /><br />Players do not need to know how to read. Despite what the maker says about the ages this game is for I am sure that younger players can play it so long as they have the attention span to sit down and play it, to wait their turn and are able to play a competitive game with good sportsmanship.<br /><br />Each player has one color of tiles, one shape of each. The pieces are laid out so that only a corner touches, each player starts in one corner. To lay down a tile you must touch one of your color's corners to another of your color's corners.<br /><br />The player can choose to make one's own territory to fill or can branch out toward the other player's starting corners. Whether you play boldly or hesitantly, defensively or offensively is your choice. Although it is best to think ahead a move or two fast thinking is necessary when the moves of other player's force you to abandon your plans and choose to make new moves.<br /><br />What winds up happening is you run out of moves due to not enough space being left on the game board to play your larger or more oddly shaped pieces. It is difficult to use all your pieces when playing a three or four player game. The games is played with 2-4 players.<br /><br />Everyone in our family enjoys this game. At first my eight year old was annoyed that he could not win easily and was a poor sport when he ran out of moves but he has progressed beyond that over the last six months. My husband really enjoys the game too which is good because he is not so keen on playing the majority children's board games or family board games.<br /><br />We took the game to a family New Year's Eve party and played with a variety of people aged 10-45. It was interesting to see how the different people reacted to it and which loved it because those players usually don't play board games of any kind and those preteens and teens usually only play video games.<br /><br />One night we took the game to our Cub Scout meeting and played it for a half hour with the eight year old boys. They found it challenging which surprised me as the gist was not so difficult for my eight year old son.<br /><br />This is a good clean fun game for young children through senior citizens. There is nothing boring about this game in the least. I can't recommend it highly enough.<br /><br />This would make a great gift for anyone open-minded enough to play board games (meaning, for those who have not written off board games entirely).

B001XRLWPQ|5.0|As a writer, I find Castle a fabulously entertaining show. So many times writers on shows are given cars by their publisher (I wished that happened!) or treated in a totally unrealistic fashion. Richard Castle might be more successful in his career than I am, but almost every show has a moment where I relate to him as a writer. More than that, I love the banter and mystery, and the supporting cast that form the relationships that truly make the show. Here's hoping there's a season 2!
0312539517|5.0|Time and a snow-covered mountain at the top of the world offer no clues about a mission's completion. The expedition taken on by an English schoolmaster in 1924 unfolds in this latest novel by Jeffrey Archer, who uses literary license to introduce George Mallory as his passionate hero. In truth, Mallory remains an enigma because there is no proof that he reached the summit of the world's highest mountain, Mt. Everest. However, PATHS OF GLORY tells Mallory's story like a fairy tale of adventure, desire and passion for achieving what no man had yet to accomplish.    Archer's research gives us a real human being, with dreams that urge him forward.  As a young child, Mallory, on holiday at the beach with his family, nearly drowns when he surfs the water to reach a high rock far from shore. Rescued by his father, the child courts a near miss with death but appears unafraid. Mallory has no concept of fear, no sense of risk.    Early on, Mallory wonders why his sisters will not be offered the equal chance for education afforded him and his brother. But life at the turn of the century in England has not yet witnessed such movements as women's suffrage and equal opportunity for education and occupation, ideas that Mallory, as a free thinker, espouse. An amusing tale emphasizes his love of climbing when he scales a wall for his primary interview at the college. During his time at Cambridge, Mallory pursues his alpine sport of mountain climbing. On holiday, he and George Finch, now members of the CUMC club, tackle the mighty Swiss Alps. Mallory soon receives accolades from Englishmen who consider him unorthodox but a sterling mountaineer.    He and Finch both revere the majestic ladies they seek to conquer. They join the quest to climb Mont Blanc, on holiday from class, where disaster betrays them in the form of an avalanche. But Mallory recovers and renews his desire to achieve what no man has done --- to reach the summit of the world's highest mountain. At over 27,000 feet,she is affectionately called Chomolungma, Goddess Mother of the Earth.    While teaching, Mallory meets a rival to the mountain for his first love. Ruth Turner, daughter of a nobleman, flirts with Mallory's friend but fancies the handsome youth whose hobby becomes his obsession. Again, he proves his willingness to court her by a high-rise shenanigan in Venice. He's successful, and Ruth becomes Mrs. Mallory.    Archer writes the Mallory story as a novel, but the reader invades the psyche of a real man with an inexhaustible desire to fulfill his dreams. How much Archer embellishes is unimportant because we walk in Mallory's boots as he tries for the summit. When the Royal Society makes plans for their first attempt on Mt. Everest, Mallory is invited. Enthusiastic, he takes a sabbatical from teaching to join the expedition. Finch is convinced that oxygen canisters are necessary for the climbers to breathe in the altitude, but Mallory rejects the idea, standing fast to that belief throughout the journey.    PATHS OF GLORY unveils Mallory's personal commitment to the expedition through letters he writes to his beloved Ruth. Whether these letters are truth, in fact, can be suggested by Archer's research involving Mallory's grandson, George Leigh Mallory II. Archer writes a lengthy epilogue describing the lives, accomplishments and deaths of those involved in Mallory's saga. It had been his desire to place Ruth's picture on the summit of Everest when he set foot on the peak. To this day, the mystery remains.    Many books have been written about the conquest of Everest, acquainting the uninformed about the dangers of such a climb. We've become familiar with the brave Tibetan Sherpas, who risk their lives to guide those climbers as they ascend. PATHS OF GLORY is a salute to Sherpas, the realities of life at 27,000 feet, and the valiant climbers who were the first to challenge Chomolungma.    Although Mallory's final challenge is undocumented, the reader is his cheerleader throughout his journey. A rousing hurrah has to spill from our lips when we read of his remarkable adventure.        --- Reviewed by Judy Gigstad
B000002W9P|5.0|I really got this album for the song halloween but after listening to the whole album it's great they were really one of the great early 80's power metal bands out their better than Armored Saint everything they did in the 80's was good the 90's into the present not so much pick it up or anything from the 80's
B0015DWJX2|5.0|I love this book!  Totally delightful.  I guess if you are used to text message communication you might find the style annoying.  But, if you long for the days of colorful, well written personal letters, you will enjoy this book.  The characters are delightful and invite you into their world and lives.  I will read this again.  I highly recommend it.

For sure some tracks out shine others but there arent any songs on here that i would skip over. My favorites would have to be:    bet you wish you had me back  innocence  familiar taste of poison  i'm not an angel (my #1)  what were you expecting?  love/hate heartbreak  better sorry than safe    I look forward to seeing this band live. Hopefully the \\"stimulate this\\" tour comes close enough to go cause if so i'll be there for sure.
0785814531|5.0|What a treat!  I got this book because I remembered a few tales from high school and wanted to revisit them.  It's a treasure indeed containing almost all genres of fiction with difficult yet fascinating verbage.  I'm not a heavy reader, but this book has had me glued for a long time and will likely read a lot of it again.
0670451495|5.0|My sister and I absolutely loved Robert McCloskey's books as children, but I had forgotten all about them... until I had a child of my own. I bought this classic for my 3-year-old as an Easter gift, after finding to my dismay that our local library did not have it! She LOVES reading about Mr. and Mrs. Mallard and all their ducklings, Jack, Kack, Lack, Mack, etc. etc. The heartwarming story never gets old, and even though the pictures and some of the text are now a bit \\"vintage\\" this just adds to the charm. I'd recommend this for children at least 3 and probably more like 4 or 5 years old. Get the hardcover edition because this is a book that could be enjoyed for a couple generations!

0575078022|4.0|It moves quickly and doesn't fall into the trap of being obvious.  It reads well.  Ultimately it is just genre fiction though.  That isn't a put-down -- I certainly haven't written anything anywhere near as good.  I just mean that you'll grab another book from the pile and move on.  You'll remember \\"Lies\\" and probably recommend it to friends, but I don't think that two years from now you'll return to it.
B001U0HBQ0|4.0|[[ASIN:B001U0HBQ0 The Curious Case of Benjamin Button [Blu-ray]]]<br />Benjamin invites us into the experience of being an outcast in the age of youth oriented worship.  In this outer limits like film, Brad Pitt brings to life a character by the name of Benjamin who has so little identity that he floats across the screen innocently recreating that invisible person that every one of us has been made to feel like at some point in our lives.  Creatively, Benjamin carves out a unique and fascinating life for himself.  From undesirable beginnings to being an uncontrollably desired object of affection Brad Pitt delivers a knock out performance bolstered by his ability to use non-verbal facial expressions and body language to render you helplessly compassionate to his fate.  To compliment this cinematic dive into the digital special effects canvas is perhaps today's prima movie star, the Goddess herself, Cate Blanchett.  Ms. Blanchett delivers a performance that leads the story line into a realm that only the actors of decades past could create.  This motion picture delivers it's message to the viewer in such a way that heart strings are played sensuously like a Spanish guitar.  With lighting reminiscent of silent film, Tilda Swinton plays the glow of 2 a.m. encounters of lustful passion as if it were her only sustenance.  Yes, we root for Benjamin.  We root for love, in a way that could only be conjured by past masters of the screen.  For todays younger audience this is a romp into an unknown secretive world of passion. BRAVO!
0634022296|5.0|So you want to purchase a really good Beatles Book.  You'll find mostly rave reviews here.  And a few not so rave.  The complaints about the binding are numerous.  And, as reviewers have stated - two choices - Get the binding removed and spiral bound or break the spine and use the clips on your manuscript stand.    Don't listen to the people who felt let down about it being just a chord book. They didn't get that message when they read the title. 'nuff said.    Don't listen to the people who say some songs aren't in the right key.  They all are.  If you find what you're playing doesn't match what your hearing from a Beatles CD, have another look at the page.  JUST BELOW THE CHORD DIAGRAMS MIGHT BE A CAPO INSTRUCTION.  So, for instance, take \\"Norwegian Wood\\".  Its in E, but you're going to put the capo on the second fret and play a D shape chord (just like the instruction says - which sounds like an E because of the capo placement.  And so on.  Now, there might not be a capo instruction, but there might be an instruction (same place) telling you to tune down one semitone (one fret).  If you check out the \\"Look inside\\" facility on the image of the book cover and keep flicking until you get to \\"Across the Universe\\", then you'll see just that - an instruction telling you to tune down one semitone (if you wish to use those chord shapes).  If you don't want to go there, you can always go to bar chords, but remember, you gotta play a Db instead of a D, and so on.    Yes, there's a cuppla songs that aren't in alpabetical order.  Big Whoop!!!  I tend to use the TABLE OF CONTENTS at the front of the book.    Its just one Beatles guitar book I own but its the most referred to.  Buy it.  Enjoy it.  For life. Yeah, Yeah, Yeah!!!
B001FB4W16|5.0|[[ASIN:B001FB4W16 True Blood: The Complete First Season (HBO Series) [Blu-ray]]]<br />It is very easy to miss the point that Alan Ball is exposing in this highly revealing Bayou Bonanza.  Alan Ball has done it again, first with the stellar SIX FEET UNDER truly ground breaking mortuary delight. Now, TRUE BLOOD punches through the glass ceiling in a cleverly designed exposure of the Cajun underworld.  Refreshingly, we do not have vampires terrorizing the neighborhood creating a heap of missing persons.  No, Mr. Ball has ingeniously reached into the swamps of the Bayou where the Louisiana so called untouchables (Cajuns), to use a polite word, has found an endless supply or buffet for Vampires to endlessly feed on without anyone ending up in the missing persons column of the newspaper. The deep swamp habitants, some of which do not have social security number or identity, nor would the disappearance of an under informed tourist who would happen to wonder into the deep Bayou are traceable.  Throw into this gumbo a shape shifting character, a gothic brothel, a Voodoo Queen, and a bubbly blond ingenue and you have the recipe for the coming of age classic Vampire story.  This re-tailored Haute Couture smoldering melting pot of urban legends of the South rekindling the taboo of blood lust and blatant sexual seduction make for an hour of television escapism.  Kudos to Mr. Ball and HBO for reaching into the dark closet of fear and pulling out a refreshing jewel of intrigue and betrayal.  And, to top it off weave into the mix a tender love story.  He invites you to sit back and savor your bowl of gumbo slowly along with a bitter Sazerac. But don't look down, you may be bleeding.

I keep trying to listen to the new metal but can't seem to appreciate bands that just run on the double bass drum, have a good rhythm guitarist that plays super fast as lead, and a growler at the mike.  If you, like me, want to hear heavy metal that harkens back to the days before hair bands ruined the genre, get Nostradamus. This disc reminds me of their early albums that showed the variety and artistry that I loved so much. The Metal Gods Have Returned!!!

The first show I watched by accident, and eventually I was tuning in or watching the episodes online. The actors are superb and have great chemistry together. The writing is quick, witty, and continually leaves you guessing as to the final result of the plot. I also never watch cop shows. Ever. This show is intriguing, it pulls you in. My roommate and I sit and try to predict the outcome, but it is never what you expect. The best part of the show though, is the witty repartee and the fully realized characters.

0756405890|4.0|A cool fantasy fiction novel! I couldn't put it down. I am confused about the plot though, it's sort of all over the place. I wanted to skip quickly through the draccus scenes, and was annoyed by the fact that Kvothe had all this wealth in his hands and then lost it all Again.  Kvothe is prideful.  I think he may in the end deserve the tragedies that befall him. He's done nothing for anyone but himself, except for his \\"save-everyone\\" heroism.  My PROS: I enjoyed the Abenthy mentoring, his intelligence, the university, his lute playing, Auri, naming things. My CONS: his ego and pride, Denna, shallow friendships.   Not since JONATHAN STRANGE AND MR. NORRELL have I been so drawn in by a fantasy world.
B0006HC0I2|5.0|I just wanted to post this review to give it the 5 stars that it deserves.  I won't be as detailed in my review but the prior reviews have said what I have been thinking about this movie for the past 12 months.  I rewatched this wonderful movie last night.  I must say...Jean Gabin is such an incredible actor.  So much like our Spencer Tracy except he can say so much with just a glance and a mere change in his facial expression can say it all.  I have seen him in some incredible Jean Renoirs and other movies of his from the 1930's...it is so neat to constrast the world weary 1954 Gabin character with his lively traveler from 20 years earlier.    This film is frank, brutally honest about aging criminals who operated with a touch of class.  They resorted to primitive violence when they needed to.    I love contrasting this free film w/ the tighter censorship of American film noirs.  It is darker and it just seems more realistic than the typical Hollywood film noir treatment.  The skating around the expression of female nudity (granted they were pictures on the wall of the nightclub) and seduction scenes were fascinating to contrast too.    The female actresses were fun to watch and linger over.  Some were absolutely beautiful and support the claim of France having some incredible women.    I love how all the characters were developed slowly and it closes with a finger gripping climax.  I was NEVER bored from the first minute on.      I cannot recommend this movie any more than I am now.  If you are a fan of Jean Gabin, French movies pre-new Wave, or if you don't mind subtitles for your crime dramas...enjoy this tightly scripted 94 minute film.  You will not be disappointed and this will stay with you for a long, long time!
B001GZ6QC4|4.0|The Dark Knight was a brilliant movie despite being about 15-minutes too long. The movie was dark, philosophical, fast paced and action packed. Some critics will state that The Dark Knight was too dark or too philosophical for a \\"funny book\\" movie. People who say that are not too familiar with the world of comic books, and the alternate realities in which superheroes live. Never confuse a comic book with the bright bang-pow, drink-your-milk and say-your-prayers type of heroes in the Sunday papers' comic strips. Comic book heroes (and villains) who are brought to life on the big screen come with much depth and baggage that is ripe for exploring.<br /><br />The Dark Knight explores the yin and yang relationship of the Batman and the Joker. Good versus Evil. Order versus Anarchy. Without the existence (even the theoretical existence) of one, the other cannot exist. The Joker, with his scarred mouth and whacked-out make-up, points this out with glee to Batman. Batman as the vigilante hero has created a villain who elicits as much fear as Batman does hope. The Joker, with his guns and bombs, has thrown the Gotham City into a tailspin. The police, the mobsters, and the everyday folks don't know how to capture him. Batman and District Attorney Harvey Dent (a scene-stealing Aaron Eckhart) fight to control the chaos through the rules and laws they've privately and publicly promised to uphold.<br /><br />To say anymore would give away too many of the surprising and excellent plot twists. As Heath Ledger's more-than-excellent Joker keeps pushing the envelope of evil deeds, the audience stays riveted to their chairs and their eyes to the screen. Each time the Joker appears, the audience whoops in disbelief at his mayhem. Oh, s**t! Did the Joker just do that?  The audience struggles with Christian Bale's Batman and Harvey Dent's dilemma of stepping outside the boundaries of their laws to bring down the Joker.<br /><br />The actors all do a very fine job in their roles. Bale is an excellent Bruce Wayne, hamming it up as the millionaire playboy in order to keep is true identity a secret. Maggie Gyllenhaal is a sexy and fiery A.D.A and love interest of both Dent and Wayne. Aaron Eckhart, with his strong jaw and a cartoon superhero's chin, brings depth to his character's arc. And of course, there is the late Heath Ledger who is unrecognizable as he is so steeped in his character. He fully embodies the insanity of the Joker making him scarier than Jack Nicholson's over-the-top cartoonish performance from nearly 20-years-ago. You never look at this Joker and say \\"Heath does a good Joker.\\"<br /><br />Christopher Nolan has made some very fine character movies, Memento and The Prestige, and he does great with the characters in this new Batman franchise. Unfortunately, it is hard to follow the action sequences. You get the idea in theory of what is happening, but you don't understand what you're seeing. That is the main flaw of The Dark Knight. Well, that, and the fact that you won't see anymore face-offs between the Joker and the Batman that is hinted near the climax of the movie.ruce Wayne, hamming it up as the millionaire playboy in order to keep is true identity a secret.

B00001OH80|3.0|This release lacks the clarity of production that earlier Bowie disks had, and needed a re-release to clean up the tracks.  The original recording is very muddy, and this enhanced disk is a little better.  The material, unfortunately, was never cleaned up.  \\"Loving the Alien\\" is a good song, but suffers from over production.  The next song is written by Iggy Pop and his guitarist sidekick, James Williamson.  \\"Don't Look Down\\" does not measure up to the original Iggy version, and only the first Pop penned tune.  The version of \\"God Only Knows\\", the Brian Wilson/Tony Asher classic is hard to enjoy.  Although the melody is beautiful enough to carry the tune, overproduction creates unnecessary mellodrama in what was a beautiful song. \\"Tonight\\" another co-written by Pop,  was performed very tongue in cheek originally as a dialogue between God and Iggy.  This version features a reggae attempt in the middle, and cashes in on the timely popularity of co-vocalist, Tina Turner.  The Iggy original was a funny song, prefaced by the vocal introduction, which is omitted from this version. Another Bowie/Pop composition, \\"Neighborhood Treat\\", is re-writen and is mixed as an 80s dance tune.  The classic on the release, \\"Blue Jean\\" follows.  The song explodes with a powerful horn blast accented by Omar Hakim's drum pops, quickly punctuating into the verse.  The mariba accents of Guy St. Onge ring in the background, aiding the rhythm just enough.  This is one of my favorites of the later Bowie  releases, with its wailing sax that bring on the chorus.  \\"Tumble and Twirl\\" is another Bowie/Pop composition, that is fairly forgettable.  The next cover is a Leiber/Stoller song, later released by Michael McDonald, \\"I Keep Forgetting\\".  I do not feel this version even stands up to the McDonald cover.  \\"Dancing With the Big Boys\\" is a powerful dance tune that unites Bowie and Pop on vocals.  In all, this is a decent release, but does not stand up to the Bowie classics.  As a true fan, I needed to get this for a few tunes, and have learned to like some of the others, but build up your collection before making this investment.  Also, be sure to get the enhanced copy.to get this for a few tunes, and have learned to like some of the others, but build up your collection before making this investment.

Who knew a pompom little chick or a crepe paper bird can look so breathtaking.<br /><br />Thanks Martha putting the chic in crafting. Giving us ideas to take our crafts out of our crafting room, drawers, craft bins and even boxes and incorporate it in daily living.
B000F3AAUW|4.0|The music is so layered and complexly textured. You don't get to hear it as well as you could if the sound mixing were more superb.  As a result, the sound is a bit flat.
1416914307|4.0|the book wasn't a great as the city of ashes because it was a little too predictable. I dont want to get into to details and spoil it for anyone but i think everyone who read the book knows what I am getting at hint: with the main character.... Anyway it was an enjoyable and i didnt regret ready it.
B00013F35I|5.0|I have seen 20 Bruce concerts and this is almost as good as seeing him in person.  Love the DVD, highly recommend it.
0545128285|2.0|Let me begin by saying that in general, I like J.K. Rowling's work. (I'm a Ph.D. in English literature, so that's a high compliment.) I read much more serious stuff, as a rule, but I enjoyed almost all of her Harry Potter books, and the gentle (if sometimes unsettling) escapism they afforded. I have to say, though, that I hated the last section of the last of the series (contrived, rushed, and pat--Deus ex machina in the extreme and so ho hum predictable that it was hardly worth the precious time it took to read it). I'd say the same--and worse--about _Beedle_. I suppose if one were pre-pubescent, it might have some appeal . . . but then, an 11 year old would not be likely to be able to comprehend the vocabulary. It's a slim book, and I have yet to get halfway through it. Like the later productions of Stephen King, it's an unpleasant deja vu--been here, done that, nothing new under the sun. I wonder with Rowling as I wondered with King why someone of considerable talent would pander his or her skills to publishers this way? I wish I could, but I really can't recommend this book, to anyone.
0789310627|3.0|This book has beautiful pictures and is worth buying for that reason alone.  However, I thought the presentation  of the content, although very informative, was a bit dry.  My son was bored before the end, and he usually has a surprisingly long attention span.
B00003CXDD|5.0|This is an enchanting story, lots of action and exciting for the whole  family...
B000007492|5.0|Let me start with the basics.<br /><br />Is this a phenomenal record?  Yes.<br />Are the major hits here?  Yes.<br />Will you like this album?  If you have heard any of the major Supertramp hits on the radio, and have liked them, then almost surely you will love this CD.<br /><br />Can you get away with this being your only Supertramp album?  Well, that's the rub.<br /><br />I always approach a greatest hits package like this the same way.  Are an artist's/band's best songs scattered across many records that contain a lot of filler or is there clearly a record or two that encompasses the most vital aspects of the band/artist.<br /><br />I want the best songs, regardless of whether I've heard them on the radio.  I want to understand the \\"essence\\" of an artist. for older bands, ones that might have been before my time, ones where I am kinda \\"going in blind\\", the collection or individual records question is the one I need the most help with.<br /><br />So to wit, should someone buy this record or go with a couple of individual Supertramp records?  After spending time with this CD and having some background with Breakfast in America in my youth, IMHO, I think the better choice with Supertramp is to go the individual records route.<br /><br />I say that for two reasons, after spending some time with this CD I noted that the songs I remember and enjoy the most basically came from two records, Breakfast in America and Crime of the Century.  The other songs *generally* comprise single selections from their other records.  Additionally, I remember really liking Breakfast in America front to back when I was younger.<br /><br />So in this case, I would recommend starting with Breakfast in America as a starter and then moving on to Crime of the Century.  And then possibly deeper into their discography depending on your newfound affinity for the band.  If I had to do it again, I would have gone this route.<br /><br />Enjoy.
B000F1IQNC|5.0|This is a very good movie. It's a different kind of spin on Mary Poppin's. It maybe a little dark for small children under the age of 6. Highly recommend if you like Mary Poppins.

B000002B2T|4.0|Haunting and beautiful - chill music for the AIC fan. Want to know if you'll like it? Listen to \\"Wake Up\\": the cool jazz chime of that xylophone over a pulsing, almost sub-sonic bass, as Layne Staley cries: \\"Slow suicide's no way to go...\\" I'm a big Pearl Jam and AIC fan and this album blew me away.
B001PPLIEG|5.0|Congratulations on the Story-line [screenplay] ACCURACY and well done !!!<br /><br />1- I THOROUGHLY enjoyed Daniel Craig's acting ,,, he is a VERY GOOD actor.<br />2- I was IMPRESSED with the story-line ,,, and its ACCURACY !!!<br />3- The MINIMAL CGI, blue-screen, \\"cartoons\\" was top-shelf !!!<br />4- The lack of ear-splitting explosions was healthful and mature.<br />5- The lack of the ubiquitous exposed cow-teat was appreciated [exposed to sexually arouse and harass children, adolescents and immature adults].<br /><br />But ,,, for my taste ,,, there were way too many unnecessary cows, clogging up the screen !!!  Undoubtedly they were in the movie to appease the cow audience ,,, and possibly children, adolescents and the immature.  --  Good thing MOST of the cows were killed off and WERE NOT \\"skinny\\" Ninja Turtles ,,, BOGUS cow-dung !!! Who believes those bony cows thrashing grown men ???<br /><br />OVERALL a well made film ,,, BUT ,,, if it were not for Daniel Craig ,,, it would be at best a \\"B\\" movie !!!<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Matthew<br />Phoenix, AZ<br />[retired baby-boomer, multi-cultured]
0553381687|5.0|This is the best novel I've ever read.  Most Fantasy lists rank it higher than Lord of the Rings.  Perfect, genius.
B001KVZ6ES|5.0|I was shocked that the Academy virtually ignored this fine film and heaped praise upon the over-rated \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" when this film explores the important issues of assimiliation and gang violence as well as \\"Slumdog\\" did but with so much more power.  If Eastwood is implying that this is \\"farewell\\" movie than he couldn't choose better one to sign off on.  Yet as one reviewer stated you could nit-pick that neighborhood Clint's character lives in is basically Africain American but doesn't deflate what the movie is about.  Eastwood's Walt Kowalski is probably one of the most complex and ambiguous character that he has ever played.  No wonder that the National Board of Review voted him \\"Best Actor of the Year\\"----and this is from a nation-wide survey of critics across the country.  Like another perennial Oscar best actor loser, Peter O'Toole, Clint may just have to accept a \\"Achievement Award\\" from the Academy. Anyway, shame on you Academy--it's really about politics and not about quality since how can an Italian comedian (Roberto Benigi) win for the atrocious \\"Life is Beautiful\\" (probably thanks to the Weinstein's constant promotion).
B001TODCII|4.0|Wow, Liam Neeson kicks some serious butt in this movie...As a thriller, this has all the elements you want. Granted, the hollywoodlike setup to the events leading to the plot are extremely typical and standard...but it delivers the goods anyway. Liam Neeson would give 007 and Jason Bourne a run for their money! The scens of him kicking butt are great, and you no doubt will root and cheer as he mows through the bad guys to get to his daughter. Very entertaining from top to bottom.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|When I saw these triggers for the first time on Amazon.com. I thought these are just something that would complicate the controllers. Since I owned one of the shooting game and my fingers kept sliding off the R2 and L2 buttons when the game got intense, I decided to see how good these Triggers could offer and I can say that they're worth every penny. The design are for keeping your fingers on the most secured places, the color matches with the controllers', and they actually make it more accurate to shoot in the game.
B001R10BEG|5.0|This is an hysterical movie with Tom Hanks at his best. Why he's not listed as the star beats me?! Plus, as an added addition, you get to see that cute Dr. McDreamy, who plays Tom as a child. Definitely ok for kids 10 & up.
B00003CX8Y|1.0|I purchased this DVD for my grand daughter because she loves it so much.  However, it will only play on 1 DVD player I have and that one is not one that she can watch all the time.  The DVD player in her room and in the car will not play it.  I believe that the problem is because it has been reproduced and not one out of th vault.  I do not have this problem with any other DVD.
B00005JNS0|2.0|The DVD was scratched and skips a lot - almost to the point where we can't use it.  However, my son is only 22 months old, so he doesn't care if we just skip over it.  I was disappointed that it was labeled 'Excellent Condition' - when clearly it wasn't
B001PU8N0I|5.0|Films like these take me back to a different time... \\"Little Dorrit\\" is perfectly adapted, perfectly casted, perfectly directed, and perfectly shot. There is really nothing bad to say about this film that not only transcends 90% of what's been in theaters lately, but tells a truly engaging and worthwhile story that will never leave your mind or your heart.    Highly recommended!
0553383663|3.0|Quite detailed story and insight on the google way and its unique approach to business and internet. That makes the 3/5 note, but the writer style is quite heavy, the book could have been much more compact, maybe because it targets a wide audience and not only geeks.  The author is also quite \\"Google-biased\\", not much criticism inside the book, but reading it through, you feel like some critical view is missing, maybe because it has been reviewed by Google... But despite this, i recommend the book for anybody willing to know a bit more about Google and getting some insider stories.
B00140PK6O|5.0|\\"Cranford\\" is one of the best mini-series ever made. The characterizations are perfect, as is every other aspect. Buy this, you're sure to love it!
0739367676|1.0|i was disappointed in the choice of readers for this series of books; Ilyana Kaducin is unable to correctly pronounce basic words, such as solder, and is also unable to give proper emphases and inflections to the reading.  My belief is that the producers rushed to get this out for the money's sake, and sacrificed what could have been a true quality reading.  The man chose to do falsetto's for his women characters, and overall sounded like a 40's radio detective, very flat and overall unappealing.  For the price, a disappointing purchase.
B000000993|5.0|It's excellent, what else can I say? The sound is a bit more raw than their follow up albums, and I love that. It has it's on unique sound and feel to it.
B00002E233|5.0|this is def a fav movie of mine first of all its the best shark movie made withi  the last 5 years and the graphics are awsome theres a surprise at the end and the whole plot is awsome another plus is that the sharks arnt great whites like you usually see there makos which look like great whites only smaller plus ll cool j is in it and so is the guy from the punisher
B00127RAJY|5.0|This video is great. In only 20 minutes Jillian Michaels works everything. You will definitely feel it the next day. Definitely worth the money.
0762434279|1.0|So I am a big fan of Rich Dad Poor Dad and give it as a gift for most graduations.  I received yet another copy today and it is 3 INCHES.  Yes, 3 INCHES with the same title!  Amazon has attached ALL 2000 reviews of the original book to this pathetic example of literature.  It looks like it belongs in a dollhouse.  Shocked would not be the expression when I received my order.  BAD BUSINESS.  DO NOT BUY, it is not what you think.
1594489505|5.0|This book has haunted me since I finished reading it over a week ago.  Many other reviewers have touched on the basis of the story, but I will just say that I learned so much about the plight of the people of Afghanistan from the days of Soviet occupation to the current time, I feel as if I understand them so much more now.<br /><br />What troubled and haunts me most about the book, and something I want to learn more about with respect to Sharia and this culture's interpretation under Taliban rule of Islam is how widespread is such tortuous treatment of women? The author's description of the devastating events in the womens' lives was so real and told with such detail, I found myself almost squirming as if I was Laila or Mariam and wanted to escape.  I just kept thinking, what can they do?  What would I do?  If I knew them, what could I do to help?<br /><br />His description of the giant Buddhas of Bamiyan had me feeling as if I were there, relaxing by the stream on the grass, contemplating the marvels in front of me.<br /><br />In the end, Mariam's reflection of her life is so touching.  I cried.  She achieved so much in her life.  As she said herself, she achieved what she had always wanted despite the sadness she had endured and despite what ultimately was her destiny.<br /><br />The story pulled me in like no other story I think I have ever read.<br /><br />A stunning, monumentally beautiful story.  I look forward to seeing more from Khaled Hosseini.
B001U6YI92|5.0|I just bought the blu-ray today, and it is the \\"Fully Restored Extended Version\\".  The box states that the play time is 161 minutes, when in reality it is 178 (PS3 has play time as 2 hours, 58 minutes, and 41 seconds).
000715481X|1.0|Be careful that this is really a unabridged edition.  I ordered one that looked exactly like the photo and it was really abridged.
0802798225|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and the more I read it sort of reminded me of S.E. Hinton's book, The Outsiders.  Alex reminded me of the character Dallas from The Outsiders if Dallas had ended up having a relationship with Cherry.  I absolutely loved Alex's character and it was heartbreaking to see what he had to go through to try and protect his family and the sacrifices his friends make for him.  Brittany's character was also touching as you watch her love for her sister and it was great to see her realize that she did not have to be the \\"perfect\\" daughter and deny herself happiness.  I haven't had any exposure to gang life and have not read many books about it so the look you get into the lives of the people who get sucked in and see what might have been if they had the chance to go straight or leave that life behind is eye opening.  It breaks the stereotype of what gang bangers are like.  This was an excellent book that I highly suggest, especially for those who loved The Outsiders.
B00007GZQZ|5.0|I ordered 2 dvd movies... They came wrapped, were in great condition and played fine... They arrived sooner than expected... Was very happy about that....
B000W796OM|2.0|I will keep this brief. I tolerate this movie because it is part of the Saga but in my opinion the director fouled up horribly. The movie is relate to the book but it skips and omits in an unbelievable fashion. The entire time thing just does not make sense. The complete overhaul of the castle is horrifying. The alteration of the movie so as to remove Quiditch entirely from the plot line is abhorrent. Please don't get me wrong - I enjoy the movie but as I said - only because its apart of the series. But in my opinion the director did not really care much about the storyline or the book.  He had an idea - he had never read the book - he altered, cut, mutilated and destroyed.  So. Thats all I have to say. Just dissapointed that this movie could have been so much more... and it wasn't.
0060254920|2.0|I know this book is legendary in children's literature but my children were not as enthusiastic as I thought they would be when I read it to them (they were close to 6 years old at the time). I was disappointed too. I'm trying to figure out the hype but I just don't get it.
0375805613|5.0|I had no idea the treasure this book was until I read it to my children and then to their kindergarten classmates. If you read to groups of small children, this is a must-have in your collection. On our first read, they were a little apprehensive about what they would find at the end of the book but after they discover who it is, they love it and love having the book reread to them knowing the ending. I couldn't recommend this book more highly.
0553382152|5.0|This book has changed the way I think, made me realize how limited I think of God, and how much I judge others that don't think the same way that I do.  It is definitely one of the best books I have ever read.  I recommend this book!
072325804X|5.0|This is a great book to give to a child as a keepsake. My 8 year old daughter received it as a birthday gift and loves it.
0060007737|4.0|This is a great book and excellent reminder of staying true and simple to your brand.  Al Ries makes powerful case and point reviews in the first half.  His Daughter Laura Ries led the second half of the book (included) with the \\"11 Immutable Laws of Internet Branding\\" which largely missed the boat (in hind sight)... and totally missed the call on convergance that has happened with smart phones like the iPhone and others.    But very reinforcing book on whole - what to do, and what not to do.
1594481717|5.0|Finally, a book that let me know there is a place for creative storytellers who see design everywhere they look! The further I got into the book, the more I rejoiced that my day has arrived. Thankfully, I do not need to fear that what I do best will be exported to the third world. If you have wondered what dreamy-eyed idea-generating story-tellers can do with their lives--read this book. Thankfully, the author added many resources after each topic to give substance to the pursuit of the dominant right brain.
B00005ASHM|5.0|Pet Sounds is from 1966; one year before The Beatles Sgt. Pepper album was released. Pet Sounds also uses various instruments that are played throughout the songs, making for some listening experience. It is one of the best albums ever. The 1999 edition has extra songs and mixes. Some of my favorites are \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\", \\"I'm Waiting for the Day\\", \\"Sloop John B\\", \\"God Only Knows\\", \\"I Know There's An Answer\\", \\"Here Today\\", \\"Pet Sounds\\", and \\"Hang On to Your Ego\\".
B001RTP3YQ|4.0|Leonard Cohen. Would that be enough to state? This double album, recorded Live in London, has a full band/orchestra, singers, and Leonard at his best. Songs from throughout his career are given new treatment much to the listener's joy.  This album shows why Leonard Cohen is considered one of THE seminal artists of the last 50 years, along with Bob Dylan and one or two others. I originally bought this album as a way to 'help', since Leonard got ripped off by his business manager. But getting and listening to the album, whatever reason one has for getting and listening to it is enough. It's great music by a master.
B000002UAX|5.0|This double album by The Beatles is from 1968. It is very different than their other albums. It has many different genres of music. The folk song &quot;Blackbird. Rock song &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;. The experimental song &quot;Revolution 9&quot;... Some of my favorites are &quot;Birthday&quot;, &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;, &quot;Back in the U.S.S.R.&quot;, &quot;Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da&quot;, and &quot;Wild Honey Pie&quot;. Many more songs are on this album that is one of their best.
B000002LFU|2.0|With a look back on Green I have to say this album is a mixed bag. About half the tracks are decent, the other half are pop throwaways. In fact pretty much every song here is underwhelming and feels like B-side material at best, yes even the overrated Orange Crush. Not an album I would recommend to someone wanting a good R.E.M. album. This record really marked the beginning of R.E.M. putting out mediocre and subpar material. It's a stark contrast from their brilliant early work. 2.2/5.
B000002UB3|5.0|Abbey Road is one of the best albums ever. From 1969, it has some of the best songs by The Beatles. The album is blues rock and rock. Some of the songs near the end are only a minute or so in length, but these are some of the best on the album. Songs here are \\"Come Together\\", \\"Something\\", \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\", \\"Oh! Darling\\", \\"Octopus's Garden\\", \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\", \\"Here Comes the Sun\\", \\"Because\\", \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\", \\"Sun King\\", \\"Mean Mr. Mustard\\", \\"Polythene Pam\\", \\"She Came in Through the Bathroom Window\\", \\"Golden Slumbers\\", \\"Carry That Weight\\", \\"The End\\", and \\"Her Majesty\\".
B001W63DX2|5.0|I saw the S.B.I.T. Tour in Concord California it was like going back in time. This band just seems to get better and better. They show no signs of aging and if this DVD is anything like what I saw, my television will never be the same again. This was my favorite period for Maiden the songs they wrote during this time especially, \\"Rime of the Ancien Mariner\\", was what I felt the best of thier carrier. I was somewhat disappointed with \\"The Dance Of Death\\" DVD. Not with the Maidens' performance, but with the camera work. It just jumped from Maiden to Maiden ever few seconds and was not enjoyable to watch. So with this new DVD adn from seeing the teaser here on Amazon, it looks like it's going to be a heck of a ride. Up yer Irons!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000VI70X6|5.0|This is a great concert from 2006 by Shakira from Miami, Florida. The show is fun and full of energy. Shakira's dancing throughout the songs makes for a lively show. The crowd is also lively and really into the music. My favorite performances are \\"La Tortura\\", \\"Whenever, Wherever\\", and the grand finale \\"Hips Don't Lie\\". Other songs here are \\"Estoy Aqu&iacute;\\", \\"Te Dejo Madrid\\", \\"Don't Bother\\", \\"Antolog&iacute;a\\", \\"Hey You\\", \\"Inevitable\\", \\"Si Te Vas\\", \\"No\\", \\"La Pared\\", Underneath Your Clothes\\", \\"Pies Descalzos\\", \\"Ciega, Sordomuda\\", and \\"Ojos As&iacute;\\". A lot of extras are here. The bonus clips are \\"Obtener Un S&iacute;\\", \\"La Pared\\", and the video \\"Las De La Intucion\\". It also comes with a CD and has the songs \\"Estoy Aqui\\", \\"Don't Bother\\", \\"Invetiable\\", \\"La Pared\\", and \\"Hips Don't Lie\\" on it.
B0002Z9HT8|1.0|The combined Band Aid / We Are The World / Live Aid onslaught felt like not only the death of popular music but a brutal lynching of it. Now, it gives me an insight into post-war German denial - there are people today who still believe that the vile arena ceremony in the Wembley circus sunshine on that awful 1985 day is worthy of celebration. A cultural assault so distressing that it posed an interesting question to which I have to admit to wrestling with: Save the music or the children? I knew stronger-willed characters with an equally sensitive musical aesthetic as myself, mentally able to deal with their preferred genocidal outcome. I still feel my compassionate wishy-washy liberal preference (feed the f******* world) was the right one but it certainly, most probably reprehensibly, didn't make me happy.  I flogged some carefully chosen contemporary 80's records and sent a fair portion of the proceeds to Africa; the rest on era-surviving drugs and a rape charity.
B001TOD9VI|2.0|Normally the type of story told in this movie would be more emotionally gripping and powerful, but it all revolves around a washed up pro-wrestler who is so flawed that having all but accomplished a great set of changes in his life, he can't help but self-destruct in a series of acts which culminate in his metaphorical and literal leap back into the ring, which will surely kill him.    This circuitous non-transformation doesn't expose any great truth, no grand moral, nor do we witness a martyr forced to resign to his fate for any purpose great or small.  We see a borderline washed-up nobody who demonstrates potential to better himself, but ultimately ends up willfully destroying himself for no purpose or plausible reason.      As a result it is very difficult to get invested in the story, the character, the circumstances, or the world it all took place in.  There is allegory of men generally, of wider society, or the general human condition in this film.  Even as a flick simply about failed self-correction it leaves much to be desired.    That said, the technical execution of this movie was solid.  Good directing and acting.  Just poor material on which to base a movie.    If you have a strong interest in pro-wrestling or regional wrestling circuits, or have an over the top taste for flawed-man-proves-just-how-flawed-he-is story lines, this movie may suit you.  For the rest:  Pass on it.  At most rent it.

B001HN697M|4.0|I've read some critics' reviews of this prequel to the Underworld franchise that the story is redundant, yet I felt the story had enough substance in it even though much of the mythology of the feud between vampires and lycans had been touched upon in the previous Underworld movies.<br /><br />In \\"Rise of the Lycans\\", the time period is possibly sometime in the Middle Ages, and set in some European country, in the wilds [with an intimidating vampire stronghold set against the backdrop of mountains and forests]. Viktor [a perpetually scowling Bill Nighy] reigns as vampire commander-in-chief over his coven, with his beloved daughter Sonja [Rhona Mitra] as a fiercely independent and strong-willed vampire who also happens to be in love with lycan Lucian [Michael Sheen, lately seen in Frost/Nixon]. The vampire-lycan relationship remains secret because it is forbidden, and for much of the movie, viewers are repeatedly made aware of this social stratification, i.e. vampires rule over everything [providing humans safety from the werewolves], hold lycans as slaves [Lucian is the first lycan, a human who is able to change into a werewolf and back into human form again], and the werewolves [who cannot assume human form] are the social outcasts or pariahs.<br /><br />The love story of Sonja and Lucian is credibly portrayed [well, excepting one particularly wacky mountaintop sex scene] and Rhona Mitra plays an impressive Sonja for the most part, no small feat considering she's filling in the shoes of Kate Beckinsale [I know, they both portray different vampires, but one can't help compare them]. Rhona Mitra is gorgeous and fiery, but does get a bit passive towards the end, which kind of disappointed me.<br /><br />Michael Sheen plays the angry lycan Lucian with competence and verve, and more than holds his own against vampire boss Viktor [Bill Nighy]. Their stand-offs are part of the high points of this instalment.<br /><br />The weapons used in this prequel lack the sophistication of the previus Underworld movies but given the time frame, giant crossbows, and hands-on combat are inevitable and I must say, did not really disappoint.<br /><br />The movie aside, the extras on this DVD are pretty impressive:<br />- Filmmakers' Commentary<br />- Underworld: Rise of the Lycans - From Script to Screen<br />- The Origin of the Feud - which includes interviews with Michael Sheen, Bill Nighy and Rhona Mitra about their respective roles in the film.<br />- Re-creating the Dark Ages - The Look of Underworld: Rise of the Lycans<br />- Music Video: \\"Deathclub [Wes Borland/Reinholder Remix]\\" by William Control Featuring Matt Skiba<br />- Previews [The Taking og Pelham 123, The International, Blood: The Last Vampire, 2012, Fixed Up!, Waltz with Bashir, The Informers, The Sky Crawlers, Quarantine, Resident Evil: Degeneration, What Goes Up, The Art of War III: Retribution, The Shield: Seasons 1-7, The Da Vinci Code:Extended Cut, The Devil's Tomb, The Grudge 3, and Messengers 2: The Scarecrow]<br /><br />The audio options come in English, French, Spanish and Thai with subtitle options as well.<br /><br />For what it's worth, I thought \\"Rise of Lycans\\" added more substance to the plot compared to the other two Underworld movies, which were bigger on action than actual story, and the acting in \\"Rise of Lycans\\" was credible and above average.

B00008PX8P|3.0|Some real good sound and picture quality going on here.  Also some scenes and interesting camera angles that made it more interesting than the run-of-the-mill \\"rockumentary\\".  Jimmy Page is an extraordinary guitarist no doubt, but I thought a little too much attention was given to his constant hyper-speed attack on his guitar rather than his ability to reach the listener with true music - I guess that's what he thought we wanted playing live.  That being my only complaint, it should be a double disc DVD dream come true for a hard-core Led Zep fan.
B001DELWZY|5.0|I must admit firstly that I was not and am still not an overawed by Angela Gheorghiu. She is not bad at all but I don't put her on a par with the divas of the 1950's and 1960's. Nor do I number La Traviata among my favorites. I'm a fan of the Don Giovanni/Trovatore/Turandot mold. Big operas with big set pieces as opposed to the tragic love story.    Onto the opera which is first and foremost impeccably conducted by Lorin Maazel. This is the one consistency throughout.    As to the principals, Roberto Frontali is as good as any Giorgio Germont I've heard so far and he is the most believable of the three. Ramon Vargas also acts and sings extremely well but he seems to have a voice that is ever so slightly too soft. His eyes at the end were amazing.    Angela Gheorghiu starts off horridly. She has an uncanny resemblance to the late comedienne Gilda Radner and in Act I not only does she act like a clown but sings foolishly also with an absurd amount of breathing injected into the lyrics. It makes her sound like a chain smoker.    She rebounds wonderfully though, fully transforming herself in acts II and III into the true star she has become.As the opera goes on her singing, acting, and her stage presence just to continue to improve and get better. Verdi bears alot of responsibility for that too, but I can honestly say I've never seen a bad performance turned to a stellar one in front of my eyes and ears. Listen to the applause at the end of each aria. La Scala goes from near silent in Act I to explosively loud by the end. This is a testament to the whole cast and crew but especially to Gheorghiu who turned it around so dramatically. My respect for her has increased tenfold!
0920668364|1.0|I will start off by saying that I was skewed against the book before I even read it.  (My mother in law is a diagnosed narcissist and she threw a fit during my wedding reception where she cited this book and accused my husband of betraying her because 'he promised her he'd never grow up.')     This book is little more than \\"narcissistic supply\\" for needy parents.  What child wants to read about his/her mother dying? None. Who wants confirmation that the suffering they've experienced as a result of being a parent isn't all for naught-- that they will be taken care of in their old age in exchange? Parents with low self-esteem/personality disorders.    It is appalling the way the child is continually portrayed as \\"bad.\\" (Especially humorous is the mother exclaiming that he's driving her crazy. Sorry lady, your own upbringing and internal flaws are what contributed to your obvious personality disorder, not your son behaving like a normal child.) Despite the fact that this child never wanted to take a bath and listens to strange music as a teenager, his mother still manages to love him unconditionally.  The book portrays the child negatively and highlights the mother's \\"suffering.\\" It plays on the guilt of the child and insinuates that he owes his mother the right to climb into his bedroom window when he is a grown man.  To say that this is an unhealthy relationship is an understatement.    Please, parents who love this book-- keep it for yourself. Don't subject your children to this. On the surface it may appear very benign and cute, but please look at the messages you are really sending your children with this one.
B001MYIXAW|1.0|This is an amazing film brought down low by lazy distributors not paying attention to A. the integrity of the dialogue, and B. the fans.  For a explanation of how they screwed the pooch:  [...]  The sad thing is that I bought this first pressing before realizing the problem and Magnolia/Magnet are not letting people exchange the film for the next pressing.  So lame...
0316017922|4.0|This book makes one take a new look at the unique situations that allows for talented individuals to take advantage of extraordinary opportunities available almost by 'circumstance'. You think that culture does not matter? Or that date of birth is incidental? Or that innate talent is all that counts? Gladwell encourages you to think again as to what really matters as far as those amongst us who rise to the top in terms of  exceeding all expectations and thus sparking envy amongst the rest of us. 'Outliers' these individuals may not necesarily be but achievers they certainly are.  This book will not change your life but it is a good read and should give you a new perspective as to the importance of the 'moment' we all live in.
B001AVEJ1Y|2.0|While I was really looking forward to seeing \\"Star Trek\\", I had a bad feeling that something wasn't right. And I was. As most people know by now, this really is a reboot. It doesn't look or feel like Star Trek should feel. It's way too violent. And where's the space exploration? Continuity was thrown out as were all the people responsible for making Trek popular again. Herman Zimmerman? Gone. Rick Berman? Gone. Michael Okuda? Gone. All of 'em. Gone. Oh, except Leonard Nimoy, whom I'm really glad was there for the final (?) time.   Ok. Let me get down to specifics. While I actually liked the film for what's it's worth. It just wasn't Trek. The filmmakers basically took a dump on all the past writers, directors and even actors of the last few TV series. This wasn't Roddenbery's or Berman's Trek. It was J.J. Abrams Trek. To H**L with everyone else, including the longtime fans. Ok, here we go:  1) The Enterprise is completely redesigned, inside & out. We've seen on episodes of Next Generation, DS 9 & Enterprise what old starships look like, and they don't look like this. The bridge is too D**N bright! It sucks.  2) Engineering looks about as low tech as some 2oth century factury. Seriously. What's the deal? It DOES NOT look futuristic.   3) Spock & Uhura have a relationship? Wha?  4) Kirk is a loose cannon who can't follow orders and then gets command of the Enterprise after it's only a week old?   5) The Enterprise is built in a field on Earth and not in a space dock?  6) Vulcan is destroyed?  7) Spock's Mother dies? Plus his father, Sarek, apparently has a British accent now, and he is proud of Spock?  8) In the original series, when the Romulans were first shown, they were a mystery. Even Spock knew very little about them. In this one, Pike asks Uhura if she speaks Romulan. She says she speaks 3 dialects.   9) McCoy was NOT the doctor originally. That honor goes to Mark Piper. Also, Sulu wasn't the helmsman and Chekov was nowhere around.   10) Speaking of Pike, on the original unaired pilot episode, the Enterprise, with Spock on board, had been in space quite a while. Pike said he was tired of deciding who lived and who died.  Is that enough for ya? Sorry to be so negative, but like I said, they through out 40 years of continuity, something that I thought was one of Star Trek's strengths. Everything was connected. But now it ain't. It's all new. That means that everything that will come after will most likely be drastically different, or will not exist at all. Thanks a lot Paramount.

B000000OA6|3.0|The raves for this CD surprised me a bit. I found INNUENDO an interesting Queen recording, but not a classic. Starting off with the ridiculously grandiose (in a good way!) title cut, this CD starts well and there are other cuts that support the idea that this is a good Queen project. \\"Headlong\\" rides Taylor's drums right into a nice rocker, \\"I Can't Live with You\\" spins a very basic concept into one of those nice Queen harmonies that move right along with Freddie leading the pack, \\"These are the Days of Our Lives\\" should have been a maudlin piece but is saved by Freddy's great interpretation of the nostalgic lyrics, and \\"The Show Must Go On\\" ranks as one of the great closing numbers of all time. But their best work? \\"Bijou\\" would have been a better fit for Joe Satriani, \\"Hitman\\" and \\"Ride The Wild Wind\\" are just silly flights of fancy with no hook to ground them and I could have went my whole life without having to listen to Queen's homage to \\"Delilah\\" with it's ridiculous \\"Meeow\\" chorus. One of my favorite band's and while this is worth having and I'm glad some love it so much, but for me, it's just OK.
B001TH16DI|1.0|These movies (except for Kahn) are NOT HD!!! I got tricked into thinking that since these are BluRay discs that the movies are in HD, when in fact they are not.  The packaging clearly says that these discs contain \\"over 12 hours of previously released content\\", which are the actual movies hemselves.  HOWEVER, I only noticed after I opened the wrapping that right on the box itself in tiny font on the bottom, it says that \\"*Previously released content is presented in Standard Definition\\".  THAT'S RIGHT, THE MOVIES ARE IN STANDARD DEFINITION, AND IT SAYS SO ON THE BOX IN TINY FONT.  WHO WOULD THINK TO CHECK THIS WHEN BUYING BLU-RAY DISCS?!?!?   This is clearly an attempt to trick the consumers.
1603090002|4.0|Well, well, here we go again.  After \\"The Black Dossier\\", which I found tremendously disappointing after so long a wait (v2 itself having been a bit of a let-down from the preceding one), Moore and O'Neill's famous Victorian adventure heroes return for an adventure with an actual plot.  The first of three 'graphic novellas' (it's basically just a slim graphic novel) telling the story of an overarching plot in the 20th century, the events of this one were alluded to in the \\"Dossier\\".  Plot details are discussed herein, so be warned.<br /><br />Moore said he wanted this to function both as part one of three and as a story in its own right, hence the decision to abandon the more traditional 22-page single-issue format of previous installments in favour of larger bundles.  In that sense, he has succeeded.  \\"1910\\" has both an internal narrative arc and an ending that augurs future plot developments.  On the question of how compelling this story is by itself, I would say reasonably so, moreso than either \\"The Black Dossier\\" or \\"League v.2\\", though many of my problems with this property remain.<br /><br />As alluded to in \\"The Black Dossier\\", this story picks up in 1910, with the League consisting of old standbys Mina Murray (not yet a blonde), Allan Quatermain (\\"Junior\\"), Thomas Carnacki (from W. H. Hodgson's \\"The Casebook of Carnacki the Ghost Finder\\", originally serialized in \\"The Strand\\"), A. J. Raffles (another magazine serial character, created by Arthur Conan Doyle's brother-in-law, E. W. Hornung), and a male Orlando (Virginia Woolf's novel of the same name; a major figure in \\"The Black Dossier\\").  The reign of Edward VII has ended, and the inauguration of George V is impending, with the Great War that will bring to a definitive end this period in world history whispering on the horizon.  Our crew is following Carnacki's premonitory dreams which involve the moon-child cult of Oliver Haddo (Aleister Crowley's \\"Moonchild\\") and the return to town of Jack MacHeath.  Meanwhile, in a separate plot, Janni, the daughter of Captain Nemo, arrives in London hoping to escape her father's wish for her to succeed him.<br /><br />Sexual perversion and violence against women has been a recurring theme in Moore's work (in his early classic, \\"Watchmen\\"), and repeatedly throughout the \\"League\\" books Moore seems to be depicting the nature of Victorian society (he did something similar in \\"From Hell\\", which also featured Jack the Ripper, though in a very different light to how he's shown here).  Moore has taken some criticism for his use of rape as a plot device in the past, so those critics will find more to criticize here, as the poor Janni, violated by some wharfside scum, summons her father's men to wreak deadly vengeance on the waterfront before assuming her father's identity as Nemo.  It's certainly not an act portrayed lightly, of course (and never was in his work), but as a plot element it can perhaps get a bit tiresome.  Moore has already done many stories about how, as he ends here, human civilization runs on \\"monstrous deeds\\".<br /><br />From a narrative perspective, this story repeats some of the problems I had with earlier iterations of this group:  the main characters don't do or accomplish much in the course of the story, there's little character development (only, really, in Janni's case, and that's a fairly standard story that Moore doesn't add anything new to here), or any of the things that make Moore's best work special.  The most notable feature is probably Moore's extensive use of written music, as both MacHeath and a seaside madame named Suki spend more or less all their screentime 'singing' (which comes across to the reader as rhymed narration or monologues).  This is a unique use of the comic book format that I'm not sure would really work in a visual medium, given the time that passes between panels of the song.  As with Moore's \\"From Hell\\", there's a great deal of criticism of Britain's class structure here, and the hypocrisy of the upper class of this era.  Kevin O'Neill's art is customarily good.<br /><br />This is probably the best whole installment of the \\"League\\" franchise since the original volume in 1999.  All the same, I cannot escape the feeling that there are more interesting things Moore could be doing with his time.
B001GKJ2E8|4.0|If you didn't already know it, you might guess this was a comic book adaptation: borderline super-powers, improbable weapons, innovative interpretaton of physical law, minimal plot, and complete suspension of disbelief to get things going. That part works like this:<br />\\"You mean, a centuries-old wooden machine decides who we kill using manufacturing defects in the stuff it makes?\\"<br />\\"Yup, that's about it.\\"<br />\\"Makes sense to me, where do I sign?\\"<br /><br />Once you swallow that much, Our Hero's transformation from [[ASIN:6305508550 Office Space]] nebbish (complete with red stapler) to way-cool assassin very nearly makes sense. Morgan Freeman and especially Angelina Jolie keep the action moving briskly along. There's the obligatory round of surprises late in the game, just before a 'bring it down around their ears' kind of ending. You know, the usual. Not a lot bears close analysis here, but maybe you just want to kill an evening. Jolie and crew will do the job for you quite thoroughly.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
0316017922|5.0|This was a fascinating read.  Most people do not describe books as fascinating, but this was an eye opener, can-not-put-down read for me.  The idea of sucess was, I thought, clear, but this was a revelation.  If you like to do something, keep doing it, at least for 10,000 hours and you may become a success too.  This book reinforced the idea of doing what you like, and the variability of luck. It is not always dependent on you.  It could be the parents you have or don't, where you live, what culture you come from or live in, the condition of the economy, your religion and onward.  Not everyone becomes successfull, but everyone has a chance, at least that is the way I look at it.

We feel for them and we  know how they feel.  The book made me cry twice.  I could not put it down.  It is a special book of hope and meaning.  It speaks to the awe and reaching in all of us.  It validates our dreams.
B0009XNUK0|5.0|I love this collection!  Sounds awesome with the digital mastering (I purchased the international version).  All the pieces are clear and inspiring, keeping you mindful of Jackson's innate talent and vocal abilities.  I think he took some chances with his singing in the 80's, keeping his voice soft in some areas, then bringing it to screaming pitches and cries to get certain emotions across.  He was an incredibly shy person, seeming to want so much to belong to some special person...  In the lyrics, you can hear him psyching himself into the success of his career.  He is also doing a lot of celebrating! The songs and melodies keep you moving; amazing Jackson's use of African beats and chanting, too.  The ballad-type songs are soothing; the beat-box songs are best cranked-up as loud as possible!  I love Michael Jackson, daring you to stop being a wallflower - \\"and, get your-self off the wall...\\"<br /><br />A great outlet to manage your anger - just sing along!  \\"I'm Bad\\", \\"Beat It!\\" \\"Thriller\\" and \\"Dirty Diana\\" etc etc!
0375701427|1.0|This novel, due to the awards and acclaim Roth has received, would appear to make for a good read. That is not the case. I agree with most that have explained how the novel gets off to a decent start but after Roth curiously decides to drop Zuckerman out of the story and switch to Swede, the novel gets painfully slow and difficult to enjoyably absorb. It carries on with digressions and tangents that add up to nothing and make the reader hesitant to continue picking this book up after 10 PM. The character development is absurdly poor. Roth should be gently reminded of the proverb that \\"simplicity is beautiful\\". Cut out 60% of the glove talk and develop the three main characters to give them a sense of life (an author's job) rather than reducing them to mere words on a page.<br /><br />Also, did anyone else that read this book find the transition from Zuckerman to Swede somewhat odd? I read it over a few times to make sure I didn't accidently skip a page, but apparently Zuckerman was dancing at his reunion and \\"dreaming\\" of what Swede's life was like and then it switches to the scene of Swede and Merry on the way home from the beach and it's Swede from then on?<br /><br />If you want to read Roth, read \\"Indignation\\". It is good. \\"American Pastoral\\" is disappointing.
0790731452|4.0|I enjoy this film. It is weird, quirky and fun! It is the current favorite of my young son even though it has some scary scenes when the aliens (with classic big brains!) fry the humans and turn them into skeletons. There are lots of cameos in this film which just add to its overall entertainment factor! It is just all around fun!
B00181S106|4.0|Read it first as a teenager, of course...then our book club decided we should sprinkle in a few classics, and this was the first of our selections.

Sublime, really, would read it again in a few years.
B000BJ7BCK|3.0|This movie is predictable but my young son likes it. This story is about super hero kids with special powers. It has some fun special effects and a positive message for young children. It is a safe movie for children and has some cute moments.
0525951113|2.0|I was looking forward to reading this novel because of a recommendation by Leo LaPort on one of his podcasts. The computer technology woven throughout the book was a definate plus. Unfortunately the story is about a dead genius who implements a violent network daemon set on taking over the world. Scene after scene of violent death end only when the book does when the computer wins and humanity loses.
B00000IQW3|3.0|I had forgotten how totally cheesy this movie is! The special effects are laughable and bad, but it does have its appeal. My three year old likes it! It has aliens, space ships, space fights--all done by a boy with a fluffy 1980s haircut. I would say this movie almost borders on cult film. You definitely have to be in the right mood to enjooy this movie.
B001W2I9Y4|3.0|I love this band, been a fan since their first CD..so I bought this CD after reading the reviews and thought it must just be incredible!  After my 10th listen, I realize that its just not that great.  The music is the same old stuff, but the vocals are more melodic...is that why its rated so high?  The CD's prior to this one are by far better...in all ways.  Skye rocks, dont get me wrong, but there is just nothing new at all here in terms of music.  I think people are hungering for this type of band so much, that they are blind to its repetitivetivetivetiveYEAH! nature. This band has amazing musicians, and the guitars are just crushing...but they need to spend a little more time coming up with more interesting songs.  Sorry guys, I will always see you live, but please make your next CD better than this one.
B001DF68MA|4.0|At first we werent sure if any child would be comfortable sitting in this, but when everything was attached and my 13 month old was sitting in it, he looked just fine.  He was sitting up high enough that he could see everything without having to turn side to side (as in a rear seating bike seat) and we could definitely keep our eyes on him.  He's still not sure about the headrest part and he keeps his hands down to the sides, but overall, he's extremely content when we go on bike rides.  We have gotten tons of positive comments from other parents that see him in it.  In our area most people use the bike trailers and a few rear seats.  So this is definitely something people dont normally see around here.  We've only seen one other Wee Ride on the bike trail.    I bought an extra bar so that we could attach the seat to either my husband's or my mountain bikes.  The one and only downfall is that for me (i'm 5'2\\"), I found out that i'm just too short in the torso area to allow for a comfortable ride for myself.  Our handlebars do not adjust so i am in this crouched over position which doesnt leave a whole lot of room between me and my son.  I kept knocking his helmet forward and it was just too awkward of a ride for me, so we can only have the Wee Ride attach to my husbands bike as he is much taller than me.  Even though i dont personally get to ride with him, its a joy to see him have a good time.  I think a taller mom should have no problem.
B0015WJBR0|5.0|For those who know Moon Safari's first album, \\"Doorway to Summer,\\" this is more of the same, and a whole lot more.    Like \\"Doorway,\\" \\"Blomljud\\" contains the high, soaring male harmonies that will knock your socks off.  Granted, some don't like them.  And yes, they sound a little like the Yale Men's Glee Club sometimes.  But good Lord, are they good.    Imagine the Beach Boys on steroids, and with far superior music.    And as for the music, it is smashing.  This album contains all the creativity and unexpectedness of the first--the long, beautifully constructed songs, the amazing playing--and adds a heavy dose of heavy rock.    This album is peerless.    Best of 2008--or almost any year.    My one criticism, and it is a very small one, is the cover art.  It was done by one of the band-members, and is beyond lame.    Fortunately, what they lack in art, they make up for in music.
B000083C49|5.0|Even after seeing the new Star Trek movie it still doesnt compare, in my book, to this film.  The clarity of the issue, the tight, clear storyline, the comedy (quality, timing & delivery), the great city of San Francisco and its remarkable beauty all make for the most memorable Star Trek movie ever.
0226443221|4.0|This is a very cool book.  Okay, enough with the jokes.  The topic is serious and it's likely we'll face more of these in the coming years.  How we deal with the problem and the choices we make about our environment will count a lot towards how we come out the other end.  For policy makers and others plainly interested in the urban environment and how that environment can be deadly, read this book.
B001TODCII|5.0|Liam Neeson is awesome in this movie.  The fight sequences in this movie where very realistic and didn't look heavily choreographed.  The gun play in this movie was great too.  I liked everything about this movie.  Most of the time I'm frustrated by martial arts movies that seem so choreographed that the heroes never get knocked down or injured during a fight.  I hope that Liam does another movie of this type maybe a sequel or even a prequel to this movie would be great.

1423101472|4.0|The Last Olympian is Rick Riordan's conclusion to the well-received Percy Jackson series of books (though not his last half-gods book, but more on that later).   The book wraps up the series' arc that involves the attempt by Kronos, the titan displaced ages ago by Zeus and the other Olympians, to rally his fellow titans, as well as assorted monsters, demigods, and disgruntled minor gods, to take down the Olympians and their allies, especially the Olympians' children--the demigods of Camp Half-Blood led by Percy Jackson (son of Poseidon), Annabeth (daughter of Athena), and Grover (a satyr).  As one might expect of the concluding book, the action reaches its peak and Kronos is as close as he will ever be to achieving his aims.  The book literally opens with a bang, as Percy is on a mission to blow up an ocean liner filled with Kronos (who in the previous book reincorporated himself in the body of Luke, a former member of Camp Half-blood who gave himself over to Kronos) and hordes of monsters.  From there, the Percy and his friends Annabeth, Grover, and new-friend Rachel Dare (a mortal who can see through the Mist that cloaks supernatural activity from regular mortals) careen from crisis to crisis.  Along the way, we see more of the Great Prophecy that has driven much of the action, one that seems to indicate Percy will die; we travel with Percy to his father's underwater palace as its under siege by the Titan Oceanus; we watch Percy go with Nico (son of Hades) to the Underworld and take a bold, unexpected risk; and we learn more of Luke's early childhood and his relationship with Annabeth.    In the final quarter of the book Percy and his friends must defend Manhattan, in particular Mt. Olympus (the 600th floor of the Empire State Building) from Kronos' invading army while the Olympians travel out West to try and slow the steady march to Manhattan of Typhon--the greatest monster of all and one that almost destroyed the Olympians in the first war of the Titans.   The half-bloods fight one desperate holding battle after another on their own as the Olympians gradually give ground to the seemingly unstoppable Typhon.  Meanwhile, amidst all the military mayhem, Percy has to deal with his warring emotions over Annabeth (his feelings for her, her feelings for Luke) and Rachel, as well as his newfound doubts about whether or not his opponents might actually have an argument to make about the Olympians' rule the past few millennia.  The book, like the series as a whole, is a wild, enjoyable ride, with a great overlay of Greek mythology--a mix of the well-known and the lesser-known (obscure monsters, lesser gods such as Morpheus or Hestia) as well as reoccurrences of past mythological events (the sulking of Achilles in his tent, the charge of Patroclus for instance) that are dressed up in the modern plot in simply wonderful fashion.  The book zips along with very few lags, there are several compelling subplots including Luke's background and the question of a spy among the half-bloods, the dialogue is crisp, the adolescent characters act like adolescents (albeit with lots of power), heroes come from obvious and far-less obvious sources, and Riordan layers a sophisticated level of greyness over many of the events and characters, so that it doesn't simply become an overly-simplistic battle of good vs. evil. Humor runs throughout despite the seriousness of the events and we never lose touch of the fact that Percy and his friends, for all their powers and responsibilities, are adolescents with all the baggage that comes with that age.  And it's nice to see that Riordan has resisted the urge to pad these latter books just because the books are popular--they remain tightly plotted/constructed.  The ending is relatively strong, though perhaps a bit predictable (though this is always hard to judge in YA as its intended readers don't come with the same level of experience), and certainly many of the book's elements have been seen in other fantasies, including relatively contemporary ones:  animated statues, a prophecy that seems to indicate the main character must die, a desperate defense a la Hogwarts, flashbacks into a villain's childhood, etc.  And Riordan may rely a bit too much on Percy's dreams as a way of cluing him into what his enemies are doing.  But while these are flaws, they are relatively minor ones and are quickly forgotten in the rush and enjoyment of the plot and characters.  Fans of the series will be happy to know that while The Last Olympian brings the war of Kronos and the Olympians to a satisfactory resolution, the ending clearly points the way to more stories in this world.  While I often wince at the way fantasy series, especially YA ones, have lately begun to spin out in seemingly endless fashion so as to ensure a constant flow of dollars (and movie rights), Riordan so far shows no signs of exhausting his world of gods and demi-gods and I'll look forward to seeing what he does next in it.
B001DF68MA|4.0|I researched 4 different types of products - the rear trailer, like the Burley Solo, the rear child seat like the Pilot, that installs on top of a carrier attached to the rear bicycle wheel, and the front seat that installs on top of the handle bar - and finally this one, which installs in between the handle bar and the main saddle.  I must say, this product is the best compromise of all the alternatives.  I ruled out the handle bar-perched seat because it just seemed really unsafe and unstable.  It also looked very uncomfortable.  i also ruled out the trailer because it was too expensive for my budget (the good ones like Burley) and storage would be a problem in our 850 sq. ft. condo.  Between the rear child seat and the wee ride, the wee ride offered more safety (low center of gravity), and the chance to interact with your child all the time.  The wee ride scores great on these fronts.  The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is because it seems like my daughter will outgrow it within a year.  For now, she loves it!
0307408833|2.0|I was *so* excited when I learned that a Babycakes cookbook was in the works. When it arrived, I sat down and excitedly read it cover to cover with a pen and paper in hand to make my baking grocery list. It was then that I came across upon several issues:    1) As mentioned by many others, the book is only about 2/3 gluten-free. I know that Babycakes bakery bakes spelt items, so this was not a surprise to me. However, the book sub-title calling it Gluten-Free is misleading.     2) A large amount of the recipes call for Bob's Red Mill Gluten-Free All Purpose Baking Flour. There are two problems with this. First and most important to me, this flour is N A S T Y. It has garbanzo and fava bean flour in it, and those have a very strong and bitter taste. Many bakers, including myself, hate this stuff. Second, I was dissapointed to see that the book even suggests using a mix at all. On the Martha Stewart show when Erin and Martha make  the Allergen-Free Cinnamon Toasties, Martha asks as she is stirring the flours together, 'Do you use mixes at your bakery?' Erin answers no. If this is the case, then why on earth is the cookbook directing me to do so? If the recipes had the true list of flours and starches used at the bakery, I would have an easier time making substitutions, like swapping garfava flour for, say, a combo of sorghum or rice flour, or subbing potato starch for arrowroot or cornstarch.    3) Coconut oil and agave nectar. These fabulous, spendy, and sometimes elusive ingredients are frequently used in hefty quantities in the book, and unfortunately we are left a somewhat in the dark about the details. Yes, the resources give us brand recommendations (aside: Did you look into the coconut oil source? small jar and big $$), but does not specify if it matters if we use virgin coconut or regular coco oil or light or dark agave. Since I don't want to go broke buying coconut oil, I googled and found an extra-virgin organic coconut oil by Nutiva that comes in 54 oz. containers and is reasonably priced. The same goes for the agave nectar. Madhava has a raw organic agave nectar that you can find right here on Amazon in bulk for a decent price. Hopefully these will so the trick.    4) Frosting. I do not believe these are the frostings used at the bakery. For example, a red flag to me is that the cookbook recipe for vanilla frosting is called 'Vanilla Frosting/Vanilla Sauce\\" but the Babycakes bakery frosting is called \\"Creamy Vanilla Frosting\\". While on Martha Stewart (the episode where they made the Allergen-Free Cinnamon Toastie loaf), Erin casually mentions some of the ingredients of her famous frosting. Among the ingredients is coconut milk. Unfortunately, there is zero coco milk in the book recipe, but there is liquid and dry soy milk. Babycakes NYC is a soy-free bakery. This is so disappointing to me, as I was really looking forward to making the real deal.    While I enjoy the aesthetic and the creativity of the book, I think it fell short in a number of critical areas.
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|Just got back from seeing the movie and I am thoroughly impressed! I'm a trekkie and I have my doubts about prequels anyway, but they pulled if off without a glitch. The cast was great and really pulled off the characters accurately. I saw the prequels for Star Wars and found them entertaining, but this prequel truly shines in comparison.  Even if you're not a trekkie, you'll enjoy this movie.
B000KKPN5C|4.0|Great little flash unit for Digital SLRs that are compatible.  Unit is small and lightweight and low profile on the camera allowing for better maneuverability.  Has a boune function as well which is great, best for horizontal shots rather than vertical shots because it does not swivel.  Uses 2 AA batteries.  Would recommend as a value purchase over the SB-900 which has more bells and whistles, but is 5x the cost.
B000FC1LOC|3.0|All I can say about this book is that it had it's ups and it had it's downs. All the jumping back and forth really turned me off for about a 3rd of the book but I charged through until the end because I wanted to see how it ended. It was a good book but not one of her best.
B0018QOIXU|4.0|What a voice....great songs...some other songs on album are better(in my opinion) than her released \\"Chasing Pavements\\"....love \\"Cold Shoulder\\"<br />I definitely recommend Adele  : )
0345479092|5.0|Even though a friend of mine did not send me this book until my daughter was 2 weeks old, it still really helped me. Although, I think I would have been much less stressed in the beginning if I had read the book BEFORE I delivered. The first two weeks of our baby's life was more like being in \\"survival mode\\", but Tracy's advice on \\"Starting as you mean to go on\\" is definitely helpful. Every baby is different, but I couldn't get my daughter to let me put her in her crib to sleep until I used Tracy's techniques. It worked in one afternoon for us! I'm giving this book as a baby shower gift from now on. Even the moms who turn their nose up at a book about this will be reaching for it after the 25th night in a row of no sleep!
B001C4CI8U|5.0|I love this show and several others, but I am becoming more and more disappointed with the SHORT seasons - SAME price format that quickly is becoming the Norm.    We used to get, and some programs still do, 24-26 episodes in a Season. NOW, it seems they are ONLY doing 13 episode seasons BUT charging basically, few dollars diff, the same price as a 20 something episode season. What is up with that. There are less discs, etc. I am not happy with this new way of doing a \\"Season\\"!
B0012RCMH4|5.0|The Hellhammer demos and the ep were very good. Demon Entrails is 10 out of 10, a black metal opus. This will definitely please fans of Celtic Frost, Venom, Bathory, Mercyful Fate, King Diamond. This is a must-have.
B00004XPPC|4.0|To the Japanese officer to surrender is to dishonor yourself.<br />So prisoners are treated as the lowest of the low.<br />When an iron willed British officer who was ordered to surrender meets<br />an iron willed Japanese prisoner camp commander, real sparks fly.<br />The compromise that is reached gets the bridge built, but at a cost<br />of a no-win solution,when a British commando team led by an former American prisoner of that camp comes to blow up the bridge.<br />When I first saw this movie I had no idea that the Japanese<br />were even worse than the movie showed them all across Asia.<br />To say that the devil had a good tool in the Japanese Imperial Army is<br />little short of the truth, as Japanese soldiers raped and killed near or above a half million Chinese girls and women during the war.<br />One comes to distrust the Japanese idea of honor and morality when faced with history and factual documentation of their war crimes.<br />This movie if anything soft-pedals their behavior.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I think the real reason is it reminded me of my father. My father fought in WWII, fought at Anzio and the North Africa campaign under Patton. Seriously wounded. My father didn't talk much about it, but he did say he didn't hate the German soldiers. He said they were just kids like him and his fellow soldiers. He hated Hitler and his crew, but not the German soldiers. And in Episode 9, the interviews with some Easy company vets - they felt the same way. One man said he could see fishing or hunting with them (under different circumstances). These men didn't see themselves as heroes, but they were. So much more than the readymade heroes the media seems to make today. They were the real deal.
B001TODCII|4.0|I just watched this film and was pleasantly surprised.  Liam has always been an excellent actor no matter what role he plays and this movie is no different.  Simply put, the movie is fast-paced and well put together.  My only pet peeve is his daughter who is 17 and continues to run in every scene she is in like a clumsy 10 year old.
0307266303|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  I felt like it was written specifically for me.  I am a sports chiro and see lots of runners; the first thing I did upon finishing it was to place it in the waiting room with the note, \\"All injured runners must read this book!\\"  The personal story was great. The chapters on the development and history of running shoes and on the current theories about how human evolution was influenced by running totally blew me away.  He basically summarized everything I've been researching over the past few years in my own personal quest to enjoy running again.  I was so inspired that on my last long run I took off my shoes and ran around barefoot (in the grass) for the last half hour.  Can't say enough good things about this book- buy it!
B001U0HBPG|4.0|Long movie, excellent acting by Pitt, but a little on the depressing side at the end.  What's funny is this movie somehow reminds me of Forrest Gump without the happy ending.
B00004XPPC|5.0|This famous film is long (161 minutes), is over 50 years old, and yet still is terrific, still holds up and will forever, I suspect, be considered one of the greatest war movies ever made.    'Kwai' is particularly amazing in that there is very little action in it, yet it consistently entertains. It's as good now as when I saw in the theater as a 12-year-old.  I say this to encourage younger people to check this classic-era film out, and give it a chance.    Anyone who is fascinated with character studies also might find this of particular interest regarding Alec Guiness' role in here as \\"Colonel Nicholson.\\" He was mesmerizing in his role. William Holden, Sessue Hayakawan, Jack Hawkins and the rest of the cast are all excellent, with the four mentioned above perhaps playing the roles of their lives.    The gorgeous countryside of Ceylon is photographed beautifully. David Lean, one of the all-time great directors, did this film, too, so it certainly has good credentials. A winner of seven Oscars, this great movie has stood the test of time.
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|This movie had me sitting on the edge of my seat, it made me cry, laugh and be thrilled.  It was so true to all the hype about it.  I hope this brings us many more movies.  I think the Hilton here in Las Vegas really messed up when they closed the Star Trek Experience, there is hype here that it may open again downtown Las Vegas, if it does, any Trekky should see it.  Ginny
B000QUCNOK|5.0|This is a must see!  I can't say if it was good or bad - just that it is a very, very strange movie.  Great cast, great acting.  You MUST watch until the very end.  I was tempted to stop it when I thought it was over, but there was still more.  I guarantee, you will be talking about it with your friends the next day.
B000002H70|5.0|It's hard to say anything more that hasn't already been said about this amazing piece of art.    \\"Pictures of You\\" to me is one of the best songs ever created. Everything about the song is transcendent, from the dark and elegant melody underneath to the words to the culmination. I have listened to this song  countless times, sometimes over and over and every time it never loses its brilliance.     This alone would make this album a singular work.    But it also has two other masterpieces as well, one is the song right after Pictures of You called \\"Closedown\\". It's in the perfect sequence and complement to the majesty of Pictures of You.    Then near the end of the album comes \\"The Same Deep Water as You\\". This masterwork cements this album as an astonishing one.     I have listened to and appreciated all kinds of music, from pure ambient (my current taste) to new age to rock to classical and I can say this album will stand the test of time.
B001NFNFNU|5.0|The film begins in March 1928 Los Angeles (recreated for this film). A young boy is awakened by his mother. The Red Line trolley passes down the street. The boy goes to his school, the mother goes to work at the telephone company. The father left years ago. The next day the mother is called to work and leaves Walter at home. When she returns she finds her son is missing! She calls the police, they must wait 24 hours before seeking a missing child. Is the LAPD the most violent and corrupt police force west of the Rockies? In Illinois a young boy is left behind at a restaurant. Walter Collins has been found. \\"People love a happy ending.\\" But its not her son! Or is she mistaken? The boy has no place else to go. When bathing the boy she discovers signs of an operation which her son didn't have. He is also 3 inches shorter than Walter. The police captain does not accept this. The \\"best minds\\" identified the boy. [Do the experts know what they are talking about?] Note the psychobabble of their expert. Is the report final? \\"Goodnight Mommy.\\" [Mrs. Christine Collins has no relatives or neighbors to back up her story.]<br /><br />The Reverend Gustav Briegleb, a local pastor, calls about an article in the \\"Los Angeles Times\\". Did the police wipe out the competition from criminals? [Is this some hidden history of the 1920s?] Pastor Briegleb warns Christine about contradicting the police. The dentist finds differences in the teeth of her boy. Her boy does not know the teacher's name or his seat in class. Captain J.J. Jones accuses Mrs. Collins of insanity and puts her into the mental hospital. The experts provide a diagnosis to justify her imprisonment! Meanwhile a police detective looks for a missing youth, Sanford Clark from Canada, at a country farm. An inmate tells Christine about \\"Code 12\\" where police can place a troublesome person into a mental hospital. Is the system rigged against the victim? Young Sanford Clark tells the police detective about what happened1 It is a horrible story that accounts for some missing boys. Reverend Briegleb arrives to question Captain Jones about the abduction of Christine. One patient is tortured with electroshock treatment (the science of the day).<br /><br />That police detective gets backup and they go to that chicken farm. They dig up something and call the coroner, they will search for the owner. This news results in freedom for Christine. But there is bad news as well. There is an explanation as to how to make the problem go away. Reverend Briegleb explains to Christine what could happen to her in the future if the police go after her. [A frame-up for a crime?] A lawyer, Mr. Hahn, will represent her pro bono. Those imprisoned under \\"Code 12\\" are released. A civil suit against the city shakes things up in an election year. The police captain admits Christine was sent to the hospital without a warrant or a court order. The rest of the film has the endings. The drama continues to the end. [Would a rural farmhouse have electricity in 1928?]<br /><br />This film explains why there are civil rights for people: to protect the innocent who are an inconvenience to the authorities. Editing this film to 2 hours would make it better, it is too long (like this review?). This film omits some of the true facts to make this story more dramatic. Christine's husband was in prison, Gordon Northcott was 20 and lived with his parents on that farm. Sanford Clark's sister visited him and reported the conditions to the authorities.
B001GCUO1G|4.0|***1/2<br />In an effort to milk the cash machine dry, studios are coming up with fairly new and elaborate methods of sustaining their tent pole franchises. A tent pole is any film that a studio expects to make a boat full of money by selling tickets, spawning sequels, selling DVDs, selling toys, etc., etc. Generally, tent poles involve superheroes and special effects and hit the multiplexes in the summer, when all of the kids are out of school. Fox hit the payload a number of years ago when they created \\"X-Men\\" along with Marvel Comics. Two sequels followed and now they have started a new line of films called \\"X-Men Origins\\". Presumably, the idea is to create a film exploring the myth and creation of each of the individual members of the X-Men. Whether this works or not (an entire film telling the story of Storm doesn't seem to hold as much interest as say an entire film telling the story of Wolverine) remains to be seen. But the first film is out and it is pretty good.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman returns as Wolverine and the story begins when he is a child growing up in Canada in the mid 1800s. Logan seems like a sickly child, living with his mom and dad in a palatial home. One night, as a snowstorm rages, there is a fight and Logan stumbles downstairs to find Victor's dad fighting with his father. When Logan becomes mad, he retaliates and kills Victor's dad with his bone talons. Victor learns that he and Logan are brothers and befriends the younger boy, taking him to safety in the forest. In an interesting montage, we watch as the two brothers fight side by side in the Civil War, World War I, World War II and Vietnam. They learn early on that they are virtually indestructible and want to put that and their blood lust to some good. During the Vietnam War, Victor and Logan end up in the brig and General William Stryker (Danny Huston) shows up, ready and willing to rescue them. The General is confident they will make an excellent addition to his team or mercenaries who will carry out very different types of missions. Victor fits in with the new team just fine; Agent Zero (David Henney) is Stryker's second in command and has the ability to control guns, Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) is your average smart aleck guy along for the ride until he starts to brandish the swords strapped to his back, Bolt (Dominic Monaghan, TV's \\"Lost\\") can control things, machines, people's thoughts, with his mind, Fred Dukes (Kevin Durand) can take a punch and John Wraith (Will I. Am) can make himself disappear and reappear in a different place. This is Stryker's mercenary force and Victor is all about brandishing his teeth and claws and running like the Sabretooth he is into battle. But Logan has had enough of the murder and blood lust and begins to have second thoughts. Years later, Logan is now living as a lumberjack in the Canadian wilderness. Very happy, he has found the woman of his dreams, Kayla Silverfox (Lynn Collins). Just when Logan thought his life would be peaceful and idyllic, Sabretooth and Stryker reappear to shake things up again. This leads Logan to participate in Stryker's new experiment, and allow him to introduce a strange metal, adamantium, to his bones, making Wolverine virtually indestructible. But Stryker has ulterior motives. When Wolverine learns of this, he escapes and teams up with Wraith to find Gambit (Taylor Kitsch, TV's \\"Friday Night Lights\\"), a New Orleans gambler who can control things moving through space. He thinks Gambit may be able to help him put an end to Stryker's experiments.<br /><br />\\"Wolverine\\" is an interesting film, and it has a lot of great action scenes, but there are problems.<br /><br />I always find it interesting when a high profile, big budget film like this is directed by a filmmaker who has experience on much smaller films; the director, Gavin Hood, first became known for the Oscar nominated South African film \\"Tsotsi\\". It was a very good film exploring the lives and relationships of a number of peoplewho live in the slums of South Africa. But I would be surprised if it cost $1 Million Dollars. \\"Wolverine\\", on the other hand, cost more than $100 Million Dollars. Like \\"Pineapple Express\\", a big budget comedy directed by David Gordon Green, Hood brings a unique sensibility to the material, concentrating a lot of time and story on the relationships in Wolverine's life. This helps to make the film more interesting than a lot of summer movie fare. And this type of situation happens so infrequently in big budget summer films that it warrants mention, which is a sad statement for me to make. Because of the sheer amount of dollars spent on these films, you might expect them to spend an inordinate amount of time making sure the screenplay is perfect, the characters believable, and the story suspenseful. But in many, many cases, most of the money is spent on the action and special effects leaving every other aspect of the film to flounder and flop.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman became an A Lister playing Wolverine, and he continues to give his portrayal of the character everything he has. In \\"Wolverine\\", we see a slightly different aspect of the character. As a young man, as he fights beside Victor, we see that he is fighting to satisfy a bloodlust, he is putting this need to a good use fighting for our country in many, many wars. It is interesting to see this and fit it into the puzzle of the three \\"X-Men\\" films and realize this is what Professor Xavier has been trying to help Logan control for so many years.<br /><br />It is also interesting to see Logan truly in love with Kayla. As he thinks he has escaped General Stryker and his team, he is truly happy trying to live a normal life with this lovely woman. They live in a little cabin in the woods. She is a teacher, he is a lumberjack. Sure, he has nightmares, but his life is good. This becomes all the more poignant when you consider his later relationship with Jane Gray.<br /><br />This idyll is soon threatened. Stryker shows up with Agent Zero and warns Logan about someone killing former members of his crew. And Victor has also gone rogue. Soon Victor shows up and tears Logan's life apart. This leads Logan to seek revenge and accept an offer to participate in one of Stryker's experiments. Victor is virtually indestructible, but Stryker has a new metal compound that he wants to fuse to Logan's skeletal structure, making him all the more indestructible and deadly. And Wolverine is officially born.<br /><br />Live Schreiber is very interesting as Sabretooth. Logan's brother, Victor suffers from a similar mutation in that his fingernails can become claws and he grows fangs. This, and his catlike run, make him Sabretooth. But Victor is different from Logan in that he seems to have no remorse when he kills. This makes him more ruthless, more villainous and harder to control.<br /><br />Schreiber seems to have a lot of fun with the role and really sinks his teeth into the character. (Har, har!)<br /><br />Danny Huston also does a good job of portraying General Stryker. Suitably villainous and mysterious, he is working on a project that provides the backbone to the film. He takes the team to Africa when he hears of the discovery of a rare metal substance. Each of the team members has a unique ability and all come into play when they try to storm the compound of an African Warlord. When the warlord realizes his men have been outnumbered and out skilled, he offers the piles of diamonds on his desk. But Stryker wants what appears to be a worthless hunk of metal. It is adamantium.<br /><br />Taylor Kitsch plays Gambit, a New Orleans gambler who has the ability to control the movement of objects. He pops up late in the story but quickly becomes Wolverine's ally and helps him throughout the remainder of the film. He has a coupe of unique powers to offer and these are neat to watch.<br /><br />I have a few complaints with \\"Wolverine\\". First, in a film labeled \\"Origins\\", I was sort of expecting to getat least an indication of what caused Wolverine to have this mutation. Why does he have bone claws coming through his knuckles whenever he gets mad? Why is he seemingly indestructible? I can understand why this was left vague in the \\"X-Men\\" films. But in a film exploring the origins of a single character, we have time to at least touch on this item. Also, since we quickly learn Victor is his brother, and has a similar mutation, I feel it becomes even more important to learn why they have this mutation.<br /><br />My other complaint is that many interesting people are introduced and then simply disappear or seem underutilized. During the scenes with General Stryker, we meet all of the members of his team and see how they utilize their unique powers to help Stryker achieve his goals. When the film picks up a number of years later, we find Bolt (Monaghan) now working at a deteriorating carnival using his powers to unimpress the paying patrons. A brief throwaway line a few minutes later clues us in to the fate of Deadpool (Reynolds). Deadpool is an interesting character and I would like to have seen him in action more.<br /><br />So \\"Wolverine\\" is fun, filled with action and shows some promise for Jackman. But it also sidelines some of the characters too quickly and doesn't give others enough time to shine.<br /><br />A side note, they are already working on a \\"Wolverine\\" sequel and a separate film detailing the origins of Deadpool. I wonder if that film will be called \\"X-Men: Origins: Wolverine: Origins: Deadpool\\".lling former members of his crew. And Victor has also gone rogue. Soon Victor shows up and tears Logan's life apart. This leads Logan to seek revenge and accept an offer to participate in one of Stryker's experiments.

A brief throwaway line a few minutes later clues us in to the fate of Deadpool (Reynolds). Deadpool is an interesting character and I would like to have seen him in action more.    So \\"Wolverine\\" is fun, filled with action and shows some promise for Jackman. But it also sidelines some of the characters too quickly and doesn't give others enough time to shine.    A side note, they are already working on a \\"Wolverine\\" sequel and a separate film detailing the origins of Deadpool. I wonder if that film will be called \\"X-Men: Origins: Wolverine: Origins: Deadpool\\".

069111966X|1.0|Heavily recommended by many, I decided to give How to Solve It a go, and real analysis, or should I say the science and art of proofing, is my worst nightmare. Although I do understand and appreciate the concept of proofs and consider it to be the most fundamental and mathematical aspect of mathematics, trying to prove already proven theorems, postulates, propositions, lemmas, and whatever else is a very tedious and mind-numbing task that robs the fun out of mathematics for the sake of learning. At least that's how I felt when I took the upper level college courses and amazingly survived them. In my opinion, it's the professors that needlessly made the experience of many students' to be harrowingly miserable due to their stilted, ad verbatim pedagogy with no real connection between prior knowledge and real analysis being taught. With that in mind, I've seen my math classes turned into the American Gladiators race, watching the large number of students from the beginning of the semester to dwindle down to a paltry few, and have essentially become the survival of the fittest. Why? Real Analysis, or should I say, \\"The science of proving without the art involved?\\" So, I decided to read How to Solve It to see if it could help me out while I was in one of those classes, and it amazingly did not. In fact, the book is so obscenely basic that even I could have written the same thing myself, and the knowledge contained in the book could not even guide me through whatsoever the material in the advanced classes. Maybe at just the very, very beginning of the whole journey, the book might work, and by that time, an ordinary mathematics student, falsely lured by the feeling of having fun while doing algebra, would be persuaded greatly to skip away from majoring in mathematics and find something else that is more realistic and not so painful. For me, anytime I get a problem with a proof, How to Solve It is a place I would never go to. All in all, How to Solve It is a vastly overrated book that is too simplistic and unhelpful.ed book that is too simplistic and unhelpful.
B001GCUNYO|3.0|Despite my being a big fan of Luc Besson and enjoying Liam Nesson's work, this film just never gelled for me.  Whole lotta action, whole lotta stereotypes, no particularly interesting characters, no character development at all.  You know all along what's gonna happen and what he's gonna do, it happens and he does it.
B000UD08HW|5.0|This is wonderful concert. All the reviews that are giving it a 3 star or less, well, we know you can't see or hear well. I say 4, and giving it a 5 for it just being an array of great professional talent on stage together doing what they love and do best, make music together. The concert being in Blu-ray is a A+++.<br />Oh and for the comment about viewing the concert on a 120HZ television, this is concert not a sporting event. A lesson for that comment user, 120HZ is used for purposes such as sporting events i.e., Nascar, Horseracing, well you get the picture, but apparently you didn't. I own a 120HZ and why watch a concert in 120HZ, I wouldn't. I bet the person who commented about this issue had freezing and grabbing of picture throughout the concert. If you did for the record, it's either the television (more than likely) or your PS3 is faulty.<br />I am viewing this concert by PS3 and a Sony Bravia TV.<br />Sheer delight this concert is, and highly recommend it for your collection.
031606792X|2.0|I chose to read this series based on the subject matter and I enjoyed the first 3 books to this series, they were long and easy readers.  I saw the movie first which was probably a mistake to begin with.  The 4th book was almost the size of \\"War and Peace\\".  While I understand there was a bit of a \\"triangle\\" going on, I didn't like the whole \\"in Jacob's perspective\\"  The parts with lady wolf \\"Leah\\" i thought could have been left out of most areas too.  I realize these are young readers books, but once Bella became with child it was my opinion that not enough was put into how it could have happened or any vampire historical reference on it happening before or according to legend or whatever you call it.  Unless I missed something, I never did figure out why Rosealie was such a big part of the baby situation, maybe she figured she'd get the child if Bella died?  Was she in it just for herself?  Once Bella becomes a vampire, it's like the tone of the maturity is 18 going on 39.  I thought she became pretty boring.  I thought it was strange she ran around in cocktail dresses. I didn't like the fact that the child grew at such a fast rate. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the majority of it, but i'll admit,I am glad reading the series is over, and i almost wish i had stopped reading at the end of Book 3.  Actually, I wish the wedding, child and becoming a vampire and the Volturi visitation were at the end of Book 3.  Book 4 would have still been a good many pages, but that would have been the stuff i wish i hadn't read.  I don't think Jacob should have been such a huge part of Book 4 once Edward and Bella were getting married.  I don't think Jacob should have been tied to the child.  There should have been one good guy who lost the girl but retained something special.  In his case his inherited ability to change into a wolf. Not the girls daughter's future boyfriend.  Kinda creepy    Thanks.
1569242739|5.0|If you look on Amazon, this cupcake book has more reviews and more positive reviews than any other book.  Plus it's vegan to boot!  That's saying alot, methinks.  Got me to buy it, anyway.<br /><br />I'm loving it, and other cupcake books I get (or research) seem to not deliver with actual TASTE.  (Is it just about marketing then?  Nice pics and decorations, but please don't bake?  Maybe, maybe.  Seems a little shameful, anything for the money.)<br /><br />This book is the real McCoy and everyone seems to like how they come out.  I am not vegan and am starting to substitute butter and milk sometimes with even better tasting results.  I am now an officially obsessed cupcake maker, thanks to this book.  I consider it my therapy:  I cook a bunch, taste one, and then pass the rest out - family, relatives, neighbors, work, school...who doesn't want a free homemade cupcake that blows your skirt up?<br /><br />I am on a Quest to find the perfect tasting yellow (vanilla) cupcake with a nice \\"crumb\\" and moist.  While this books delivers, the basic vanilla cupcake is just \\"ok\\" (the chocolate basic is much better).  My Quest continues...if anyone knows of one, let me know. :)
B001VB8UAE|5.0|Sublime...Stunning....Sexy.....Sonorous....Superb.....SIMPLY STREISAND of course!<br /><br />At 64 and still able to perform and SING like she does.....well the likes of her just do not exist anymore nor I'm afraid ever will.<br /><br />She remains an original artist to her fingertips ......and all at her age and still in total control of her magnificent talents.  We are blessed that she is alive & well and still in near-prime condition.  The fun she appears to be having is apparent in her banter with the adoring audience, her funny expressions and dialogue with Il Divo (they are simply dreadful & thank GOD we can just skip over their musical numbers!!) and her simply stunning Don't Rain on My Parade, where she is skipping & hopping like a little girl all in her bare, stocking feet!<br /><br />Yes, the VOICE is not what it was 10 years earlier, and the keys are lower, but how it has aged......smoky & deep yet still able to climax a song like no other....I'm finding more emotions in how she expresses the meaning of a lyric.....My Man.....Have I Stayed Too Long at the Fair.....People.....The Way We Were......and capping it off with a most exquisite rendition of Smile, probably the most moving version since Garland's.<br /><br />Yes, this concert is heavily  \\"produced\\" in terms of photography/sound design, lighting, staging, etc.,.......but Barbra is the last of the classic glamorous Hollywood stars and of course she would want her (most probable) final live performance in pristine condition for posterity and the ages to view.<br /><br />This woman's phenomenal body of work in every genre she's touched is astonishing and this concert is a significant and much valued addition.<br /><br />Oh, did I forget to mention my personal fav?  The soft & lyrical Nobody's Heart Belongs to Me where her voice is so pure & gentle...then followed directly with a SLAM!  BAM!  rendition of Arlen's When the Sun Comes Out where Streisand holds nothing back, belting out as only she can this number first recorded by her in 1963!!!<br /><br />Beautiful Barbra......Beautiful.<br /><br />Luigi ~ nyc 13th May 2009autiful Barbra......Beautiful.

B0000033WC|5.0|Yes it was a blatant attempt at commercialism and yes Cale and Tucker are not on it, and yes it's more accessible than earlier efforts and yes it has always been in fashion to snub this 4th VU album. I've been listening to the 4 VU albums for close to 30 years now and I have to say that in spite of all those things, this album is a masterpiece. This album continues to blow me away with its raw rock and roll honesty and to the detractors I say you need to keep listening.

B00006LI4D|5.0|The piano/standup bass/guitar combo has always been my favorite in jazz. In this setting no one can lay back. This came out not too long before or after the passing of Ray Brown. His playing on this is amazing, as is Monty Alexander's. However, I really believe it is Russell Malone who stands out on this disk. He really delivers here with some hard swinging stuff. This reminds me of the albums Monty and Ray have made with guitarist Herb Ellis, especially the \\"Straight Ahead\\" album. You will not regret having this in your collection. They played together really well. If I'm not mistaken, it also serves as Ray Brown's final release. Very recommended.
0553345834|3.0|In What They Don't Teach You at Harvard Business School, Mark McCormack offers readers advice on how to interact with others on the job. McCormack organizes the material into many short, interesting sections and that makes What They Don't an \\"easy read\\". The book's organization makes it easy to resume reading after one has set it aside for a while. What They Don't would make a good beach book (at least for people who can stand reading about business at the beach).     The book also offers some good suggestions. I particularly liked McCormack's discussion of three hard-to-say phrases (\\"I don't know,\\" \\"I need help,\\" and \\"I was wrong\\"); most people will probably find themselves recounting times when those phrases would have prevented heartache on their jobs. I also enjoyed McCormack's advice on negotiation, the need to be organized, and the power of silence in interpersonal communication.    Unfortunately, I have to agree with those reviewers who have pointed out the book's shortcomings. While McCormack's advice generally is good, he is an egotist and a self promoter. McCormack spends pages bragging about the insights he possesses that others lack and he also constantly \\"name drops\\" (Arnold Palmer, John DeLorean, Roone Arledge, etc.). Furthermore, while McCormack offers his readers advice on many topics, he attempts to cover so much ground that there is little depth in most of the material.    In summary, if readers can get around McCormack's ego, they will find some straightforward, thought-provoking advice in What They Don't Teach You at Harvard Business School.
B001HN697M|3.0|I was pretty excited to finally see this after missing it in the theaters, but now I'm just disappointed. The back story of the Lycans is interesting and does shed some light on the feud between them and the vampires, but it seemed to me that the higher ups focused too much on special effects (which WERE rad) and not enough on plot substance. Some of the fight scenes had such quick camera and angle changes that they were hard to focus on, but I have to give them props for not having gratuitous nudity. The few scenes between Sonja and Lucian were kept in the same vein as the one between Celine and Michael in the last underworld. Overall, a ho-hum prequel that could've been a whole lot better but worth watching if you're an Underworld or fantasy fan.
B001RTP48G|4.0|What an affirmative return to the splendour of synth pop that Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe have spent the last 20 odd years cultivating...     While their previous album 'Fundamental' sounded darker and met with mixed reactions from fans, 'Yes' boasts the best of the vintage PSB sounds that are decidedly more upbeat and positive, with their underlying ironic wit on love and its failings invariably intact.     From the 60s wah-wah sounds of 'Beautiful People' to the electro-robotic 'This Used To Be The Future' featuring Phil Oakey's trademark Human League-speak (on the bonus disc), to the sugar-coated `Did you See Me Coming?', the Boys sound as buoyant yet scornfully-jaded as during their `West End Girls' days.    It would not be a complete Pet Shop Boys album without some flamboyant chic in `All Over The World' which layers Tchaikovsky's `Nutcracker' over techno-beats - with arguably novel results (Naysayers may regard this track as muzak from the 'Hooked On Classics' era).    Nonetheless, totally enjoyable.
B000RZIGVS|5.0|Very attractive and every disc works. Did I mention it arrived in a flash? What more could you ask for?
B000002L7J|5.0|The songwriting partnership of Morrissey (lyrics and vocal melodies) and Johnny Marr (music) has been called the Lennon/McCartney of the emo generation. I don't like the \\"emo\\" genre at all nor do I like many bands that are compared to The Smiths...But I love The Smiths and I adore Meat is Murder.    This was the first album and first collection of songs I heard by this band and what first struck me was how unique they sounded. The production of the album does mark it as a child of the `80s, but their songs were instantly memorable and fascinating.    The 10-track album begins with \\"The Headmaster Ritual,\\" one of my favorite songs still. Its memorable rhythm combined with Morrissey's mopey vocals make for a great song. \\"Rusholme Ruffians\\" could instantly turn a new listener away, but once again I love it. It's a song that really takes you to the fair that Morrissey is singing about. The next two songs are \\"I Want the One I Can't Have\\" and \\"What She Said,\\" which were the two songs I listened to the most upon first hearing this album. \\"What She Said\\" sounds particularly good when blasted through earphones.    \\"That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore\\" was the single from the album and wasn't very successful. I only began to appreciate it recently. The song has a lush arrangement and with Morrissey projecting as much emotion as he can muster while singing it, it's actually a beautiful song that even people who dislike The Smiths could probably get into.    \\"How Soon Is Now?\\" is one of The Smiths' most recognizable songs and what a great song it is. Not the best of the album, but a great tune. The riff, the layered rhythm, the atmosphere, the lyrics, and the vocals are just fantastic. \\"Nowhere Fast\\" was another one of my favorite's on here and still is; very catchy, with great lyrics.    \\"Well I Wonder\\" tones it down a bit. It's very melodic, with a great bassline; another song of beauty. \\"Barbarism Begins at Home\\" has a funk element to it and not a whole lot of singing. It's nearly 7 minutes long, but it's a song that will stay with you once you hear it.    Finally, we have the title track. I always thought of this song as a joke, but listening to it again I found it's actually quite a haunting song and the way Morrissey sings it is unlike anything he's ever done. You can hear what sounds like anger and disgust in the cadence of his voice. A very good song, but not the one I'll be putting on repeat.    Anyway, I heard this album once over a year ago. I enjoyed it a lot, but never listened to it again. Three weeks ago, I randomly played it again and have been listening to almost nothing except The Smiths since.    The Smiths defy genre. I can't just call them \\"rock,\\" but pop-rock, alternative, nor emo seem to fit them either. The band is almost universally acclaimed for the lyrical capabilities of Morrissey and it is true, the man is a lyrical genius. He writes with such truth and realism, his lyrics ranging from brooding to sarcastic, sometimes at the same time. Even with sub-par lyrics, he could still pull it off as he's a great singer. He drones, moans, mumbles, mopes; it's sometimes very dramatic but that's not a bad thing. Some may find Morrissey's vocals annoying, especially when he goes from singing to just making noises (see the chorus of \\"The Headmaster Ritual\\" and parts \\"I Want the One I Can't Have)...But, the fact remains, no one could sing these songs as well as he could.     I love this album and I have no doubt that any Smiths fan would as well. This was my introduction to the band and should serve as a perfect one for any budding Smiths fan out there.    Poppy, funky, memorable, witty, beautiful, and filled with great songs \\"Meat is Murder\\" is wonderful. Not everybody likes The Smiths and this is one of the CD's that just makes me wonder how you could not like something this unique and special.    GRADE: A-
B00260HH3K|4.0|funny enough...this movie actually surprised me.  Everyone and their grandmas told me that it was unwatchable,unbearable.  Though, this was not the case.  The movie did a fine job of making a live action kids movie of db. People forget that this movie is not based of of dbz but dragonball.    the fights should have just been longer and a higher budget would have made this a 5

B00019PDKC|4.0|Good Disc. Disregard the review below, it is obviously not that bad. Some people dont have the required patience for this stuff.<br /><br />Might I say very 'Radiohead'-ish. Especially in its Vocal delivery. But this is a different album (disc) and one which takes more than one listen and a few dark nights to appreciate. It is very unique but you do get the feeling they were in a Radiohead phase while writing this one. That is not a negative, but it does hit you once in a while when listening.<br /><br />Each song has its own sound and the production is crystal clear. You have to be open to it, nothing will bite you at first. The lone 'Heavy' track is 'Pulled Under at 2000 Metres a Second'. Its a real kick at the midpoint of this disc. The other tracks are a bit more artistic and the tracks are fairly long. If you want old Anathema, buy the old stuff. If you want heavy, this aint it!<br /><br />Here are the songs:<br /><br />First 3 tracks are just great. 'Harmonium' has a nice loose feel, but is a creeper. No real chorus but straight forward and gets the disc off good. The vocals work on this mood setter. Gives a very good understanding of what will follow.<br /><br />'Balance' and 'Closer' work together with 'Closer' being a very interesting track with its synthesized vocal and single drum base beat. Really works well and is different from anything I have heard in a while. Gets in your head.... and stays!<br /><br />'Are You There?' is next and to be honest, it doesn't work for me. Very mundane and just drags it down after 'Closer'. Hate to say it, just being honest. Its personal but not a good song. I usually skip it.<br /><br />'Childhood Dream' is kind of a preface to the aforementioned '2000 Metres' and these 2 tracks also meld together well. The heaviness makes for a good break from the moodiness. Really kicks you unexpectedly.<br /><br />The title track is great. Excellent female vox make it a breath of fresh air. I love this track. Sounds like nothing else. Very basic in that it doesnt really do much, but its emotional delivery and guitar notes hold your interest. An almost southern feel, like walking on a desolate sand road in the summer. Another creeper that sticks with you.<br /><br />'Flying' I initially didnt like. The vocal just was TOO much in the Radiohead vein, but now I do appreciate the song and the vocals. Vincent really has a laid back style to begin with, but this one takes a while to take to. He really does sing this track well and the vocals do give the song its originality stamp. You can feel the emotion, it just takes a few listens.<br /><br />'Electricity' I just love. An almost barren track without much more than a piano for the most part. The vocals are basically spoken, but they make the song really cool. Vincent's delivery on this track couldnt be better because its what makes the song tick. Again, when listening to the flow of this disc as a whole, it fits very very well.<br /><br />'Violence' is decent if not a bit long. Its an instrumental timing in at 10 minutes. Very atmospheric and layered. Has a heavy mid section but quietly almost evaporates to gently end the album.<br /><br />This is not a track disc, its a complete work. Though it is not a concept record, you definitely will not be able to only listen to one track on those occasions you play it. Its a special record and I actually think some parts are better than 'A Fine Day To Exit'. It is just quieter and a bit moodier (if you thought that was possible).<br /><br />Very glad I have this and if you like their stuff post Doom style, you should really have it as well. Again, if you have patience, you will be justly rewarded.<br /><br />Getting into Anathema a bit late in the game, I know many people wont see this review now, but I had to do it. Especially after the useless review below. Its a great record and its unfortunate that it didnt do better. Dont waste time, pick it up.delivery and guitar notes hold your interest.

B001NFNFNU|5.0|At first I expected it was a remake of The Changeling (1980) a horror, and thought how Angelina Jolie would do that. But I was wrong and unexpectly impressed with the story and most of all scene of LA in 20s (yes i know it was CGI). The idea of LAPD systematic corruption was never in my mind and the most shocking is a serial killer matter that's excite me. And about ms. Jolie, she's doing great here, but I expect her more expressive as a mother of losing child. For the idea and story I give it 5*
0452289963|5.0|I listened to this on audio cd, and I think it really helped deliver the message and allow space to practice some of the exercises and really get the most out of it. You have got to give this book a chance, if you don't get it or like it after the first chapter, don't continue!! You'll know right away if this is something you will learn from, don't let other people tell you what to think about it, just get it and try it for yourself.
0312360266|3.0|This was a good read, much better than I had expected. I'm actually looking forward to reading the next one.<br />Vampyres are a different race in this books, like African Americans, or Native Americans, or Indians. One day Zoey gets \\"marked\\" a Vampyre comes and marks her with the crescent moon symbol, this means Zoey must go live at the House of Night. One thing I must say is Zoey reminds me of Bella from the Twilight series, because although what she discovers is a BIG deal she just keeps on acting like a normal teen and things that most people would be freaking out about don't seem to really phase her that much. Zoey sneaks out of her house because her parents think she should stay there and they can get the church to come and pray for her. She goes to her grandmother's house because her Gram is the only person who really listen and accepts Zoey. While she is looking for her Gram Zoey falls and hits her head. She has a sort of a \\"spirit walk\\" where she meets Nyx the Goddess of the moon/night. When she wakes up he is in the House of Night infirmary and her crescent moon is filed in (which is unheard of in a fledgling). Zoey meets her roommate and makes some friends(and some enemies) and gets an invite to the Daughters of Darkness ritual(which is the \\"in\\" crowd pretty much)so she goes. She starts to notice that she can sense other things, she sees a ghost and can feel different elements when the circle is cast. Eventually she and her friends decide they need to overthrow the current Daughter of Darkness leader because it becomes clear that Zoey is meant for something great.

0439813786|4.0|This book was beautifully illustrated and it was such a fun read.

B001AVEJ1Y|1.0|A well written story is one that can stand up to critical discussion. Star Trek, by JJ Abrams is so badly written that it can only stand up to critical discussion so long as viewers cover their ears and eyes and shout \\"LA LA LA LA\\".  JJ Abrams relied not on good storytelling, but on plagiarism, shortcuts and convenient effort-saving devices to slap together a 2nd rate summer action flick that doesn't deserve the name \\"Star Trek\\".<br /><br />By way of example, the villain Nero was lifted wholesale from Nemesis, while his motives and actions were lifted wholesale from Wrath of Khan, while the time travel scenario to wipe out the Federation was lifted from First Contact.<br /><br />The premise goes something like this: a bad guy comes back in time in a heavily armed, heavily armored, nearly invincible simple mining ship to wreak havoc on humans, Klingons, and Vulcans all of whom are completely defenseless in the face of such an advanced and utterly invincible mining ship.<br /><br />The story is simply not believable. We are expected to believe that \\"a simple mining ship\\" would be armed to the teeth. It would in fact be well enough armed to defeat in battle scores of heavily armed and armored Klingon and Federation ships of the line while suffering no significant damage itself.<br /><br />We are also expected to believe that having had his home world destroyed by a natural disaster, and having been accidentally sent back in time 154 years, instead of trying to save his world or at least warn them, he spends the next 25 year plotting revenge against a guy who tried, but failed to save his world.<br /><br />We are also expected to believe that his ship's crew would go along with him and hide out in deep space in utter isolation for 25 years instead of mutinying and then going home and saving their civilization.<br /><br />What about Kirk? How is it that a 3rd year college cadet is promoted to Captain of a Starship before he even graduates and while he is under disciplinary review? Who, aside from J.J. Abrams, could possibly imagine any real life naval force giving a college student, however brilliant and talented, command of their most advanced and potentially destructive ship of the line?<br /><br />And isn't part of a ship's captain's job administering day to day operations? Young Kirk was amazed at the sight of a Starbase. I can induce from this that he has not spent much time in actual space. He would therefore have no experiential knowledge of Starship operations. Wouldn't that be kind of an important factor in choosing the permanent commander of a ship?<br /><br />The list of unbelievable but incredibly convenient and nearly magical plot points goes on and on. And I won't list them here as they are listed elsewhere in great detail. For other examples see [...]<br /><br />Abrams not only produced a film with a lousy story but he also completely ignored established Star Trek canon both major and minor. And not all of it can be explained away by simply saying \\"alternate reality! Alternate reality!\\" as some do.<br /><br />Here's a short very incomplete list of examples of Abrams either ignoring or not knowing established Trek canon:<br />1.  Spock being a Vulcan male would only have sex every 7 years during the Pon Farr.<br />2.

B00007B6RW|5.0|I really like this Pink CD - it's got a lot of the songs they play on the radio of hers.  But I especially like her duet with Steven Tyler - Misery.  There's also a few other really great songs that weren't radio hits.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Look I stopped reading romance novels when I was twelve, but I like dramatic TV. I had almost given up on HBO. But this is an amazing series. The best ever female romance fantasy with intense sexual overtones. All the while that is going on, there's a mystery to be solved, with lots of violence and drama for the men.<br /><br />I wondered why I was so mesmerized by this series, and then found out that it was written by a woman, and the woman's point of view, unlike 90% of what you see on film or TV. Sookie is sought after by powerful and gorgeous men, be they vampires or shapeshifters. When do you ever see that on TV? I hope this is a hit and it changes Hollywood for ever more.<br /><br />New sexy vampires have emerged and it's about time for bored women everywhere. We didn't know what we were missing. Stephen Moyer could raise any woman from the dead.. My only complaint is that the writers don't give him enough screen time. Sigh.
0375842209|5.0|I have to admit I never write reviews, yet count on them while selecting books.  But when I read this book, I just HAD to write a review.  First of all, this may be categorized as a Young Adult read, but I didn't find it at all juvenile in its presentation.  That said, I have to recommend this book to everyone who can read.  It's the most true and pure piece of literature I've read in a while.  Death, the narrator, definitely presents this tale in an amusing way.  Yet its starkness in discussing death and the people left behind to deal with the world and their reactions absolutely made this book.  The main character, Liesel, is someone anyone can relate to when thinking back on childhood.  And of course Rudy, her best friend, was also loveable and amusing.  However, beware that after reading this wonderful book, you WILL be thinking about it for days.  I actually cried for a good hour after reading it, and I'm not easily moved.  To quote one passage, \\"My heart is so tired\\".  I can definitely relate to that passage after reading The Book Thief.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I am a fan of all things vampire. So I turned on True Blood without having read the books. I have family from Louisiana and Kentucky and my daughter is attending Duke Law School in Durham, North Carolina. I am familiar with the South and I know that this is not the true character of the region but what the hell- it is great television. It hit's you with every stereotype you can imagine but if you can lay back and open your mind to the experience it all works. The storyline and characters draw you in and the new take on vampire's and vampire lore will keep you coming back for more. I love television and True Blood is great television.
B001FBSMF8|1.0|Let me start with a disclaimer by admitting that I have never listened to this album, nor do I intent to. That being said, I think that the intentions behind this effort can be clearly interpreted by any semi-serious music listener without the benefit of hearing it. My criticism of Chris Cornell has nothing to do with his decision to make a departure from his traditional genre/musical setting, nor in his desire to work within an electronic-based format. My criticism has solely to do with the choices that he made in the collaboration for this album. To explore an electronic-based format is one thing. To do so using the most popular producer currently working in the bland superficial landscape of mindless pop music is another. And to bring in a guest artist as pathetically talentless as Justin Timberlake, to me shows not only a complete lack of integrity as a musician, but ultimately clarifies Cornell's original intent for this project in the first place- to be relevant in today's increasingly boring and unoriginal popular music industry.          If Cornell's true intentions were to explore a different genre, I'm sure there are numerous underground producers that would have jumped at the chance to work with him. Why then did he choose the producer that just happens to be a corporate money making machine? Coincidence? Hardly. Cornell for some reason wants to win the same fans that buy Brittany Spears records and watch mundane reality television programs- in short, those with no culture.          Ultimately, the man is free to make whatever music he wants to, this is obvious. He doesn't have to manifest the same early 90s angry grunge rocker persona in his present life, and nobody should expect him to. It is because I admire him as such a brilliant musician, song writer and conceptualist that I find his latest decision so appalling. It has nothing to do with the fact that his latest record is electronic-based. It is the personnel he chose to collaborate with. In many ways, it's a fundamental reaction that I think anyone with a grasp of the concept of 'musician vs. entertainer' could appreciate. Justine Timberlake is just as talentless and as much of a waste of time as he was when he debuted with NSYNC. Nothing has changed, except for his overexposure in the media and the constant barrage of his presence in every entertainment format imaginable. Then all the sudden people think he is relevant because all of that promotion, which is ultimately just propaganda. Twelve year old girls dictate what is considered culture these days. Can you imagine Cornell circa Down on the Upside period playing with NSYNC? Why does he think it's of value to do so now? Timberlake's music is just as empty as it was then. These people are not interesting, except to those who think that glamour, fame and superficiality are interesting. We can thank the Justine Timberlakes of the world for further diminishing the cultural content of this country. That's fine- as long as true musicians avoid collaboration with these idiots.            However, Cornell seems to be another example of a brilliant iconic rock composer who just stayed in the industry too long. I believe that a rock musician should make his mark, be very important for about six years or so, and then disappear. Cornell chose to stick around, and in doing so alienated a lot of fans to be sure. Hopefully Cornell's next effort won't include a member of the Backstreet Boys. Now that Cornell is taking up fashion modeling, perhaps Versace can choreograph his next tour. Shameful, and devastating for this Soundgarden fan.......
0385338732|2.0|I was disappointed with this, especially after hearing such good reviews! It was not the writing but the actual story and characters. I found Lexi's family and friends' scathing reactions to her amnesia unrelatable and uncomfortable to read. Pages and pages of insensitivity and ridiculous situations. I liked Kinsella's Shopaholic series, this one just did not do it for me, it wasn't enjoyable. I couldn't even finish!
142312166X|3.0|Reading \\"The Demigod Files\\" is not something that is needed to understand The Last Olympian, but there are stories in the book that are entertaining and give more background to Percy's summer at Camp Half Blood.  I liked it, but it wasn't as good as the real books.
0316067598|5.0|This book is amazing. It has just the right amount of history to bring you where you need to be to hear this story. Many of the men of the 101st Airborne Easy Company (WWII paratroopers that Band of Brothers is about)state that they are not the heroes, the heroes are the men who died fighting. I can see their point, however, I think those men like Marcus Luttrel are also heroes because they certainly acted VERY heroically. To act heroically must make one a hero.     This book was VERY well written and could not have told the story any better. I cried, even though I knew what the outcome would be. I cried for the SEALs who died, and I cried for Marcus Luttrel for all he went through to survive.     READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!
1423101472|5.0|I've read and followed every book in this series.  I had so many expectations for what this book would be like, what Annabeth and Percy would go through with Rachel, what Grover would do about Pan, and what the demigods would do about Luke and his betrayal.  And I have to say that this book lived up to the expectation.  I didn't think SHE would be the mole, I didn't think HE would die...  So many twists and turns and it was  PERFECT!!!!

B00003CX9E|5.0|For all the baggage that Citizen Kane is bagged with, it's pretty remarkable that underneath, the hype (Citizen Kane tops the list of AFI's greatest films of all time, on both editions), the hate, and opposing view points about it, Citizen Kane is really a good movie.  Make no mistake, in my opinion, Citizen Kane is not the best movie of all time, but that's not it's fault some people scrutnize it because of those biased film geeks at the American Film Institure (though it certainly has more of it's virtues than a magazine like Rolling Stone does) It is one of the most innovative films, however, and I won't deny the importance of the movie.  The good thing about all this is that the movie is still a great movie, and has a good story, and the filmmaking and artistic quality is still very good.  Here's why I think so.<br /><br />Personally, I don't think the film making in this movie is a product of it's time. While it's not as fresh as it must have been when it was first released, it's still has artistic quality and has some of the coolest shots still worth looking at years later.  The Rosebud shot, the opener, the noirish look, the scene with the mirrors, even the art direction in this movie is great.  Cinematographer Gregg Toland deserved an Oscar for his work (of course he didn't), as it's as incredible to hear about the details from the commentary from Roger Ebert (this man is a film critic, he knows a ton about film that idiots like Ben Lyons and Gene Shalit only wish they did).  The acting is great, and it's hard to believe that Welles was able to pull off both young and old Kane (the make up was responsible for the old, and that was even influential), convincing no less.  It always feels like a meticolously crafted film, and it pretty much is.  The only potential thing that could be considered dated in some eyes is the black and white and 1941 production standards, which to me don't even matter much.  Everything else looks as fresh as it did in 1941.<br /><br />Citizen Kane is basically a pastiche of William Randolph Hearst, a newspaper king who apparently did not like this movie because it portrayed him in a negative light.  Regarding it's meaning, the message may be obvious for a lot of people.  And no, it doesn't rely on the symbolism.  I sort of agree with Ray Carney on the symbolism part, which is nice, but not really a profound statement.  Symbolism to me is more like a cool footnote, and if it's done tastefully, it works merely well. (that can't be said for the millions of mediocre student films that say nothing, except they are slathered with pretentious symbolism).  Citizen Kane is both of the previously mentioned.  However, I do not find the scene where he finds the globe to be symbolism.  I've seen objects before that totally transfix me and take me back to my younger days, I don't know, but it does.  The object isn't the focus, the way he reacts to the object is the focus.<br /><br />Rather, I think Citizen Kane is loss of pureness, or idealism.  Kane wanted to help other people because he's truly believed it in the beginning, but gradually became selfish, empty.  Kane is just a representation of just how many things can be reduced from their good intentions to emptiness.  Look at the concepts of free will, individualism, love, and personal fullfillment.  All of these things are pure when taken in the right mind, but all of these have been robbed and dumbed down into general fakeness (the government, marketing, music, movies, even people themselves) and used to push buttons, sell products, and trick people into believing the fakeness is actually genuine.  At a most basic level though, it shows that money indeed doesn't buy happiness, and you have to be internally motivated, and for good reasons.  There's nothing more enriching than good relationships (with the right people) and genuine care,  and if we give in to greed and fakeness, we could end up just like Kane.  That's my take on the meaning of Citizen Kane.<br /><br />Is Citizen Kane, in my opinion, the best film of all time?  It's definitely the most influential, and maybe it deserves the greatest title as a monument kind of stature, but it will never be among my favorite films of all time.  And that' mostly the difference here. It will never be a personal favorite to me, but Citizen Kane, for the right camp (I am in that camp), will satisfy mightily.  Please ignore everyone else and whatever anybody tells you and like it for how you like it.  There is no other way in life in figuring out what you like.e.<br /><br />Is Citizen Kane, in my opinion, the best film of all time?

B000000W6R|2.0|I'm a huge fan of the Smashing Pumpkins (I have all of their other albums and for the most part really enjoy them), but this did not live up to my expectations.  The album is filed with a bunch of songs that didn't quite make it to cd previously, and probably shouldn't have made it to this one.  Besides their cover of Landslide, and maybe one or two others, I probably won't be giving this a listen again anytime soon.
B00008OWZC|1.0|Zep needed Jimmy Page's well-honed expertise in the recording studio to put across the two or three (sometimes less) listenable songs per album. And yeah, those rocked. In fact, the only tolerable Zep CD would be a 14-song compilation from their studio albums, and that might be stretching it. I really believe this band was the basis for This Is Spinal Tap, only Tap had better material. (\\"Big Bottom\\" would be a songwriting advancement for these clods.) I was watching The Song Remains The Same the other night and it was almost torture. No, it was torture except for Rock N Roll and Peter Grant foaming at the mouth. Of course, all you had to do was look at the stoned-out 16-year-olds in the audience to know Zep wasn't exactly performing for a discerning audience. And the volume was always turned to 11, so what did it matter? The sloppiness continues on these California shows. The untreated Plant vocals are fingers on a blackboard. Screeeeeeeeech. And Jimmy's thunderous riffing gets OLD OLD OLD. If Robert Johnson knew how these limeys would butcher the blues, he never would have made that supposed pact with the devil. Zep's Greatest Hits--demand it. The rest is garage band junk with a whole lotta SUPERHYPE.
B000000W6F|4.0|Not my favorite album, but definitely worth purchasing.  It sounds more like Siamese Dream than any of their other stuff, but even still no two Pumpkins albums are the same.  It was great to hear what their debut album sounds like to see the progression of their music over time, not to say that they wouldn't have been fin sounding like this for awhile.
B001TODCII|5.0|For the few who gave it bad reviews I say relax man, it's a movie not a documentary. I found the movie to be interesting and entertaining. Besides, I always like to see the bad guy get his due. One of the most memorable parts of the movie was his line about having special skills, I will find you, and I will kill you. I thought Liam did a good job portraying his character. It had a good ending as well and that's always cool, for me at least. I and my wife sat there watching the movie and just went for the ride it took us on. In all, I just plain liked the movie.
B000003TAR|4.0|Nirvana does well throughout the entire album.  Though there are many songs that will blend together or be completely forgotten, their are definitely enough memorable ones to really brig the album together.  Unlike Nevermind where only the first five or so songs were worth listening to, In Utero deserves full attention.
B001U0HBPG|5.0|This movie leaves me speechless. If you decide to take the movie as depressing then it will appear that way. Fortunately I see the movie differently, it is an odd combination of love and death with an underlying motivation to enjoy life. When faced with adversity BB decided to survive and enjoy life. He experiences everything he possibly can, a lesson all of us could internalize and apply to our lives. There is a lot of death but the movie clearly demonstrates reality, we all are touched by death in our lives and this movie is not afraid to show it. Once again BB meets the challenge and embraces death as does Cate Blanchett. It happens what can you do? Love also is a major focus, a childhood love that remains and survives amongst time, ages, distance, and appearance. Amazing graphics and an exquisite and fascinating story. This movie makes you think about life and death and how you can embrace both and have a balance in your life. Wonderful!
B00008A7QK|4.0|According to most critics, this album was one of the most important records of the '70s.  And they're right- the range of styles showcased on Electric Warrior influenced everyone from Bowie to '80s New Wave.  So what's there to argue with?    Musically, nothing.  Marc Bolan combines the grooves of rock ('n roll) with a keen ear for melody, crafting tunes that you can dance to and hum along with.  Plus, Electric Warrior's got a wide palette of moods- the swampy groove of \\"Mambo Sun\\", the dreamy strings of \\"Cosmic Dancer\\", and the blues riffs of \\"Get It On\\" (the famous \\"Bang A Gong\\" in America).  But lyrically, phrases that seem to be minimalist and pithy at first become simple and uninteresting after repeated listens.  The aforementioned \\"Cosmic Dancer\\", for example, seems to be awash in symbolism- but, one quickly realizes, is not.  The album's music is so interesting, fortunately, that you forget about the weak lyrics.    If you've never heard Electric Warrior, borrow a copy and give it a listen.  It's one of those albums that you really should hear once.  But if you've heard it, you might want to wait before rushing off to buy it.

B001MW0J2O|1.0|Apparently this album is mixed so it sounds like it actually contains melodies and ideas ONLY if you have a wool cap pulled over your ears AND you wear that wool cap outdoors and indoors 365 days a year, except when you take it off to polish your horn-rimmed glasses.  I've also heard it sounds great on headphones, but only while riding the L train.    I'm an open-minded guy, though, so I'll give it another chance after I get my scraggly beard going.
B001TH16DI|5.0|After reading some of the negative reviews i seriously considered not buying this box set. I am an avid Star Trek fan and ended up deciding to buy it. The deciding factor was that I wanted to help promote the franchise.         Most of the negative reviews were written by people who have not seen this product. When I put the first movie in and saw the picture and heard the audio I was amazed at how awsome it is. You have never seen star trek like this before. If you are a Star Trek fan you owe it to yourself to get these movies! This box set is a tremendous upgrade from the old DVD's. the quality is so much better that it is almost like watching these movies for the first time! Can you tell I that I am excited?         I don't think that anyone who has actually seen this blu-ray set could give it less than 4 stars. If you are considering buying this box set you should disregaurd all ratings that were posted before the release date. The negative reviews show a great deal of hostility towards paramount which is not productive, nor is it a true indicator of the quality of this great product. If you only look at the reviews that were posted after this set was released you would have a solid 4+ star rating.    It is true that it could be better. As with all things there is always room for improvement. Maybe they could probably improve the video quality a little bit on I,III,IV,V, and VI if they had completely remastered them, which they probably will in the future. They could have also added the directors cuts, which they probably will in the future. They could have released all 10 or 11 movies together in 1 box set, which they probably will in the future. If anything less than the exact perfect box set configuration makes you angry at the manufacturer then by all means wait untill that day comes. Maybe two or three years from now they will put something out there that meets all of your specifications. If you like the original series movies and you want to enjoy them in a whole new way then buy the six movie set with confidence and have a great time watching them today!    GREAT PRODUCT!!!
B000PC1N54|3.0|I was looking for a modern replacement of my old Met Opera DVD of Aida and, as someone who likes the spectacle of Grand Opera, decided to buy this Franco Zeffirelli directed version from La Scala. I noted that a number of the reviewers had mentioned the superimposed images and fade-ins and fade-outs employed by the director and how much it had annoyed them. However, I thought they were probably being too subjective and I couldn't imagine that a video director would have been given so much of a free hand that it could detract from Zeffirelli's production. How wrong I was! In the triumphal march in Act 2 the stage is full of people, the costumes are opulent, the props are magnificent, the orchestra under Chailly is building up to a climax and yet Patrizia Carmine thinks that she can improve on all of this by adding dissolves through drapes and superimposing close-ups of trumpets; not just once, but again and again.<br />There is so much to like about this production and I no doubt will watch it occasionally, but it could have been so much better without the interference of the video director. I would go so far as to suggest that all might not be lost and the DVD could possibly be re-released without all the offensive and unnecessary additions. How novel that might be, a non-directors cut of the opera.

They encounter an alien probe that takes Ilia and replaced by a robotic probe named V'ger. If you want a good film to help put you to sleep, this is it.

When he's chosen by The Master to become the new Dragon Warrior, a position that brings virtually unlimited power to the individual who holds it, Po is thrown into round-the-clock training sessions to help groom him for the role - kind of like Eliza Doolittle on steroids.<br /><br />The plot of \\"Kung Fu Panda\\" - with its echoes of \\"The Karate Kid\\" and even of \\"Star Wars\\" in its portrayal of teacher/pupil relationships - is fairly derivative in nature and lacks the kind of  strong secondary characters we`ve come to expect from computer-animated  films (no slam intended on the voiceover work by Dustin Hoffman, Ian McShane, Angelina Jolie, Lucy Liu, Seth Rogen and Jackie Chan).<br /><br />Still, there is sufficient energy, wit and visual inventiveness in the movie to captivate the little ones while keeping the rest of us from actively storming the box office and demanding our money back.  This is most definitely not one of the \\"great ones,\\" as animated features go, but it is short and pleasant enough to at least earn it a spot in the recommended column.

B001TOD92C|4.0|A touching portrayal of a used-up hunk of meat trying to get back on his feet. You will cringe when you see what he goes through to make a living as a wrestler; some scenes are not for the faint of heart. You'll also get an inside glimpse of this seemingly crazy world.<br /><br />You will be on edge as you watch him try to rebuild his life and relationships, always teetering on the brink of disaster. I can't say much more without spoiling it, except that it's powerful and moving and ... oops, almost gave it away.
B000UNYJV8|5.0|First off, the film maker should be commmended for showing that many aspects of the skinhead culture appeal to those who want a sense of belonging, identity, and need for empowerment. Joining a group with a \\"hard\\" style and outlook provide for this. Many skinhead films solely rely on violent scenes to get this point across, but this film shows how the main character (and the other characters also) was affected by many different emotional influences, like Shaun's loneliness and the violent Combo's sense of his glory days being long gone.     Combo's sense of frustration is given an outlet and validated by the usual nationalistic, \\"everyone in the government and minorities are the source of all your problems\\" rhetoric that still goes on even today in the U.S. as well as Europe. Of course this leads to a horrifically violent act, and young Shaun shows his sense of being let down by everything that has happened in his life so far at the end of the film.    Sadly, an epiphany such as this is sometimes what is needed during the course of growing up to advance to the next stage of emotional maturity, which is to be secure enough to deal with the disappointment and loneliness that sometimes comes to us in life in a positive way.
B0000V6SOG|5.0|This is an excellent cd.  I bought this one over the other Love Actually soundtracks because this particular version--the UK version--had all three of the love themes: Glasgow love theme, PM's love theme, and the Portuguese love theme.  It also has a great selection of good music by loads of great artists.  If you enjoyed the music from the movie at all, you would be very happy to have this cd, and it will be worth the money you spend on it.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|This DVD was purchased for my four grandchildren ages 9, 7, 5 and 2.  The 9 and 7 year olds watched it continuously for five viewings and enjoyed every minute.  The 5 and 2 year olds only watched it one viewing at a time, but were more than ready when it was time to see it again.    Having seen the movie when it was first brought out by Disney, I felt it was reproduced well so that younger generations can enjoy this truly clasical film.
0307387178|5.0|This is the haunting, heartbreaking, true story of Chris McCandless, who died alone in the Alaskan wilderness at the age of 24, trying to survive by hunting and gathering all of his food. Krakauer's article on McCandless for Outside magazine apparently brought a number of Chris's friends and acquaintances out of the woodwork, giving Krakauer enough material to fill in some of the blanks in Chris's two-year odyssey, as well as correct a few errors. Krakauer argues convincingly that McCandless was not as unprepared and foolhardy as many people believed for a stint in the wild. McCandless did, however, make some tragic mistakes that cost him his life. Krakauer also includes in the book the story of his own solo trek in Alaska that could have very easily resulted in the same fate. McCandless was a fascinating but frustrating and headstrong young man and remains an enigma. He was smart, musical, athletic, and well-liked by almost everyone who came in contact with him, but he struck out on his own for two years without a word to his family. Time and again, people he met on the road helped him out despite their initial reluctance. His heroes were Leo Tolstoy and Jack London, but as Krakauer points out, he was trying to live Jack London's fiction, which was a far cry from Jack London's life. My favorite anecdote in the book is the story of Chris's abandoned Datsun, which, ironically, was rescued and resurrected. Krakauer's storytelling is so vivid that it kept me awake at night, long after I finished the book.
B001HN697M|1.0|First of all, the actor playing Lucien doesn't seem right for the part. In the first movie, when he started growling while transforming in that flashback scene, it looked silly rather than frightening. I think it's because the way he's made up, his forehead is too big, and his face is scrunched up under it. He doesn't radiate power or danger but looks more like a brainy type. I don't know if that was intentional in the casting, but it's weird.<br /><br />Second, it's just boring. Although it was nice to see Tannis again, in his former glory. The plot moves too slowly, and the Victor chews the scenery with every line - always looks like his face muscles are about to pop out of his skin.<br /><br />I got to where Lucien is waiting for whatshername at the clearing and I simply didn't care anymore. I hope it didn't get better after that, because I sent that DVD right back.
0061474355|3.0|Positives: Unique setting, variety of magical systems, and plot. Also, most of these elements build up, starting quite weak(unfortunately), but ending strongly. The ending also brings good resolution and a strong climax.<br /><br />Negatives: Lots of poor plotting and wasted words, especially in the first hundred pages. Characters are fairly weak throughout, and even the most interesting ones fall flat. Also, the story seems downright heavy-handed where life and death are concerned, slaughtering off important people without so much as a condolence note. It has some element of realism to it, but it's too extreme and too unemotional to work well. Most magical elements are explained and handled well, but the ones with Mogget, especially at the ending, just jump forward without any sort of explanation.  The novel mostly just drags on too long.<br /><br />Overall: Sabriel is unique and interesting, worth reading once, but probably not worth buying or re-reading.
075640407X|1.0|Written at a seventh grade reading level, Name of the Wind, may be better categorized as young adult fan fiction. As a book for young readers written as fan fiction, it might have shown an editor somewhere Rothfuss had potential. Instead praising it to high heaven leaves an aftertaste of shills and the shills who lofted praise should be ashamed of themselves.     It never ceases to amaze me the mediocre, subpar garbage that gets published and praised never. The person who acquired this at Daw must have called in every favor ever owed to get something so pedestrian reviewed so highly. Instead of praise, she should have told the author this was a nice first effort. Then she should have told the author to write a new book following the basic tennants of writing. Finally, she should have superglued a note to the author's hand:      Rule #1 Show don't tell   Rule #2 Description is your friend   Rule #3 Dialogue should seem realistic   Rule #4 Characters are more than stock traits   Rule #5 Don't send me your First draft again    What pisses me off the most is that I went in expecting at the very least a good read, but what I found was nothing of the sort. There's nothing new or original. Nothing. The world Rothfuss creates is as mundane as all the caricatures he populates it with.
B001MEJY8W|5.0|If you liked Hostel or Midnight Meat train this movie will definitely please you.  I hate movies that say that they are horror only to find out they are love stories with a ghost, or some other crap that is not horror.  This movie does not do that.  To start with it is a little slow, but is well worth sticking it out.  I will buy this movie and add it to my personal collection.  I find a movie to buy about 3 or 4 times a year, so If I am going to buy it I must want to see the movie over and over again.

B001S86J0I|5.0|In 1999, \\"Galaxy Quest\\" was a film that surprised many sci fi fans when it was released to theaters.  At first, many people were not sure if it would be a parody to \\"STAR TREK\\" but in the end, the film was actually paying homage to the popular television series.<br /><br />The film is directed by television director David Parisot (who directed shows such as \\"Curb Your Enthusiasm\\", \\"Monk\\", \\"ER\\" and many other series) and is based on a story by David Howard and a screenplay co-written with Ric McElvin (\\"Men in Black II\\" , \\"Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events\\" and \\"Addicted to Love\\", etc.).<br /><br />The film has received praise from Star Trek alumni such as George Takei, Jonathan Frakes, Patrick Stewart and Will Wheaton and has received nearly all positive reviews from film critics upon its release in theaters back in 1999.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"Galaxy Quest - Deluxe Edition\\" has been digitally remastered for this DELUXE EDITION/10th Year release.  I haven't done any comparisons to my original 2000 DVD version of the film but I could tell by watching it, scenes like the mission obtain Beryllium, this would shine on Blu-ray.  But for now, on DVD the colors look vibrant with the Earth tone colors and blue skies make things absolutely beautiful.  Video is presented in widescreen.  So, overall, for a DVD release, the picture quality and the new remastering looked great.<br /><br />As for the audio, audio is presented ala English 5.1 Surround (as well as Spanish 5.1 Surround) and comes with a Thermian 2.0 Surround track.  I will say that watching this film again, I heard a good number special effects from the various channels.  Audio sounds very good, I was noticing small details such as the damaged spaceship, the Protector trying to use its remaining engines to move the ship and hearing it trying to move in space on your front channel and rear channels speakers.  I don't recall hearing those small details back in 2000.  I felt the audio seemed cleaner and clearer in this deluxe edition.<br /><br />With a new digital remaster for the DVD coinciding with the 10th Anniversary of the film's release, I can only hope that we get a 1080p High Definition transfer with lossless audio.  Knock on wood, I hope there will be a Blu-ray release coming soon!<br /><br />But for now, compared to the original DVD release, this is the better DVD version to own for now in terms of picture and audio quality.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Galaxy Quest - Deluxe Edition\\" comes with newer special features to celebrate the film's 10th Anniversary.  The original DVD released in 2000 had special DVD Easter Eggs (related to the Omega 13) and a \\"On Location in Space\\" featurette that are not included on this deluxe edition, so you may not want to throw out your original 2000 DVD.  But this Deluxe Edition comes with newer features recently created in 2009 and are very enjoyable.<br /><br />* Historical Documents: The Story of Galaxy Quest - (18:14) A new featurette with recent interviews with Dean Parisot (Director), Bob Gordon (Screenwriter) and David Howard (screenwriter).  Also, new interviews with the cast of \\"Galaxy Quest\\".  A fun and informative featurette of how the film came about, how the talent felt about being at a science fiction convention and being a bit weirded out by the experience and also certain segments that play homage to \\"Star Trek\\".<br />* Never Give Up. Never Surrender: The Intrepid Crew of the NSEA Protector - (23:25) This featurette goes into the casting of \\"Galaxy Quest\\".  The cast is interviewed and give their thoughts of their character and what they remember during the filming.  Interesting tidbits of Sigourney Weaver being in character once she had the blonde wig and attracting a lot of eyes.  How Alan Rickman was very cool and calm. Tim Allen and Daryl Mitchell always having fun on the set and really interesting situations that happened during the filming of \\"Galaxy Quest\\".<br />* By Grabthar'sHammer, What Amazing Effects - (7:03) How popular Stan Winston worked on special effects for the alien monsters and Industrial Light and Magic working on the CG effects.  How the camera work for \\"Galaxy Quest\\" was trying to recapture that Star Trek original series cinematography feel and much more!<br />* Alien School - Creating the Thermian Race - (5:23) How Enrico Colantoni (Mathesar) came up with the Thermian speech from vocal training they did at Yale.  How during \\"alien school\\", they would have to learn how to walk and move.<br />* Actors in Space - (6:11) In this segment, we learn how being in a popular series, an actor can get pigeonholed.  Tim Allen talks about people even today thinking he's Tim Taylor of \\"Home Improvement\\", Justin Long talking about despite his film work, he's still looked as \\"The Mac Guy\\", Daryl Mitchell known for his work on \\"House Party\\" and more.<br />* Sigourney Weaver Raps - (1:59) Sigourney Weaver's agent's birthday was coming up, so Sigourney asked Daryl Mitchell to help her create a rap for Sam Cohn and together with Sam Rockwell, Missi Pyle, Jed Rees, the five created a music video as a birthday present.<br />* Additional Scenes: Deleted Scenes (Used on 2000 release) - A total of eight deleted scenes.  Some of these features include commentary by the talent or Director Dean Parisot and David Howard.<br />* Thermian Audio Track - An audio track featured completely in Thermian.  Personally, even when this was on the original 2000 DVD, has anyone ever watched the film completely in Thermian?<br />* Theatrical Trailer (Used on 2000 release) - (1:54) Original theatrical trailer.<br /><br />The slip cover has a front cover that features Alan Rickman, Sigourney Weaver and Tim Allen in character, standing cool and collected (the image shown above on this review) and when you shift the front of the cover slightly, it shows the three firing their weapons.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />\\"Galaxy Quest - Deluxe Edition\\" is definitely a wonderful 10th Anniversary release.<br /><br />I have never grown tired of this film and for any Star Trek fan or science fiction fan, you can't help but enjoy and laugh and be thoroughly entertained by the various talent and the overall wackiness of the storyline.<br /><br />The new special features is what makes this film worth buying again on DVD.  To have everyone return for an interview and talk about their love for the film and how well it was received and how it has become a sci-fi classic was just fun to watch.  And the behind-the-scenes tidbits you learn about the shenanigans that went behind-the-scenes to the actual creation of the film, was also informative and entertaining.<br /><br />If there is one thing that I can hope for, that would be a high definition Blu-ray release of this film.  With its 10th Anniversary, I was a bit surprised that only a new DVD was announced at this time.  But with the film now receiving a new digital remastering, I can only hope for a HD 1080p transfer and lossless audio, to me, that would be the icing on the cake.<br /><br />But overall, this new deluxe edition was just fantastic and if you are a big fan of \\"Galaxy Quest\\", on DVD, this is the definitive version to own.

B000HBK3MM|5.0|Corinne Bailey Rae has one of the most beautiful voices I have ever heard.<br />Her music is inspirational, melodic and heartfelt. When I received this in the mail the first thing I did was play it after a long day at work and it did the trick- It helped me to relax, and it put a smile on my face- no joke...this is a great record, from start to finish; I'm glad I bought it.
159562015X|4.0|Having read \\"Now, Discover Your Strengths\\", I've bought into the concept behind understanding and leveraging your own strengths. Our entire team took the online quiz, and we organized a team-building event around sharing our strengths.  I had found the original book helpful for understanding my own strengths, and having the team understand theirs has helped us all to realize how we can leverage each other to do great work.  Results of the strengthsfinder quiz have been extremely helpful for our managers to understand what motivates their teams, and we also use the book to get a quick read on new hires.  I recommend that you understand and accept the philosophy behind the book, before using it as a management tool.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|I have dual suggestions for anyone thinking of trying FRINGE.  First, definitely watch it.  Second, be very, very patient.  The show eventually gets very, very good, but it takes a very long time to get there.  I have a theory as to why that is.  FOX has a tendency to micro manage many of its shows.  DOLLHOUSE is an example.  After Joss Whedon brought them his initial pilot, they nixed it and asked for a new one, and then dictated that the first several episodes be standalone episodes.  And guess what.  In the sixth episode DOLLHOUSE became one of the best shows on TV, with multiple delicious plot twists.  The weakest part of the series?  The first five stand alone episodes.  I have not heard similar things about FRINGE, but given that the first half of the season tends to be almost all stand alone episodes and that they are far and away the weakest part of the show, I suspect more FOX interference.  FRINGE has been compared to THE X-FILES in many ways, but one way that they are dissimilar is that THE X-FILES standalone episodes were far superior to FRINGE's standalone episodes.  So the viewer has to be patient for the payoff for watching the show to come to fruition.  But the payoff does finally come.  About halfway through the series a \\"mythology\\" arc emerges in a most satisfying way, resulting in a string of deeply satisfying and exciting episodes in the second half of the season.  At the end of the first year, it hasn't yet quite become a great show, but it shows all the potential of becoming one.  But perhaps only if FOX will get out of the way and let them get on with the story.<br /><br />The show also suffered from internal problems, the main one being casting.  I came to like Anna Torv in the lead role of Agent Olivia Dunham, but she remained in many ways the show's weak link.  Many fans noted that her American accent (Torv is Australian) often faded and especially early in the show her Aussie accent would briefly creep in.  She isn't a bad actress, but neither is she - comparing the show once again to THE X-FILES - Gillian Anderson, who was by any accounting a brilliant actress.  When I watch FRINGE, I often wonder just what the show would be like with a stronger actress in the lead role.  I also have not yet become sold on Joshua Jackson as Peter Bishop, but this may be far more of a problem with the writers fully integrating him into the show.  (Though the season ends with a great, great twist involving Peter that explains a lot of the background on Walter's story.)  Other than being Walter's son, his role in the greater scheme of things hasn't really become clear, though perhaps the writers envision a more crucial role in Season Two.  Lance Reddick is a powerful physical presence, but is another actor who has perhaps been under utilized at this point.<br /><br />Which leaves John Noble as Walter Bishop.  Is there a more delightful supporting character on TV?  He steals just about every scene he is in as the delightfully idiosyncratic and marvelously insane genius Walter Bishop.  Walter is both a wonderfully written character and brilliantly portrayed by Noble.  Sci-fi series do not as a rule get much recognition by the Emmys, but I would love to see Noble get a nomination for Best Supporting Actor in a Drama.  Many of the great moments of the show's first season revolve around Walter.  And there are so many fine Walter moments that some go unnoticed.  Among my favorites was in the show's penultimate episode where the crew is assembled in Walter's Harvard lab and someone says they need to turn the lights out.  Walter gleefully tells them all to hold on and he claps his hands, demonstrating that he has \\"the Clapper\\" installed in the lab.  But what makes the scene so funny is a very subtle bit of business.  Walter has been passing out cookies and has one of his own.  To be able to clap, he has set his own cookie down on the derri&egrave;re of the corpse he has been examining and that is laying immediately in front ofhim.  So while Walter is clapping his cookie is on this dead guy's rear end.  Typical Walter.  Not least because of Walter's penchant for blending the investigation of the most grotesque phenomena with food.  Icky disfigured corpse?  Nothing like that to get Walter to think about food!<br /><br />The best thing about FRINGE is that it got better as it went along.  This is a great sign for Season Two.  I blame FOX for the slow first half of the season.  Maybe I'm wrong in doing that, but we know for a fact that FOX messed up the first half of DOLLHOUSE, and they've been known to interfere with the development of other shows.  The fact is this:  executive producers and their writers know more about how to do a great show than network executives do.  Maybe they feel that they need to earn their salaries by \\"crafting\\" the new series, but generally what they do is mess things up.  You hire someone like J. J. Abrams or Joss Whedon to do a series, just get out of the way and let them do what they inevitably do better than you do.<br /><br />So definitely watch this show.  Be patient.  It starts off OK, but about halfway through the season it will really start to kick tail.  I think there is some core weakness in the cast, but not to the degree that it cripples the show.  Best of all, this show really feels like it is going somewhere special.  Make sure you are along for the ride.is clapping his cookie is on this dead guy's rear end.  Typical Walter.

B000WQW988|5.0|I am sorry I waited so long to find out what Cobane was about.  His music in the DVD is haunting.
014017821X|5.0|According to the introduction by Helen Simpson in my copy of Angela Carter's \\"The Bloody Chamber,\\" the author herself is adverse to the description of this anthology as \\"retold, adult fairytales.\\" Instead she claims that: \\"my intention was not to do \\"versions\\"...but to extract the latent content from the traditional stories and to use it as the beginnings of new stories.\\"<br /><br />That is as may be, but the truth is that the simplest way to describe \\"The Bloody Chamber\\" is to say that it is a collection of reworked fairytales geared toward adult readership. Ten in all, each one is based on an old fairytale, and Carter explores her own personal ideas and understanding of these familiar stories in her \\"new stories;\\" being particularly concerned with the metaphorical meanings that are inherent in each one.<br /><br />Perhaps the best way to describe them is to say that they have echoes of the old symbolism and imagery of the old tales, but act as \\"remakings\\" rather than \\"retellings.\\" As such, what is gathered here is a series of stories that delve into themes of sexuality, femininity, mutability, transformation and the capability of humankind for change and growth. It is not for the faint-of-heart reader, for often these stories can be violent, crude or grotesque. At their core, all fairytales are about two things: life and death, and in \\"The Bloody Chamber\\" they are transposed and presented as sex and violence.<br /><br />Yet there is an hypnotic quality to them in their atmosphere and resonance that kept me hooked (and certainly leaves room for multiple re-reads).<br /><br />Carter's language is opulent, rich, sensual and complex. That sentence is a preview of what you'll find in this book, as Carter seems to adhere to the general rule that no noun must go without an adjective - or several. Yet it never seems to tip into purple prose, not even when she's comparing water-stains on the dark red wallpaper to the indentations left by lovers on black satin sheets. (Of course, if any of that just made your eyes hurt, then it's certainly best to give \\"The Bloody Chamber\\" a miss).<br /><br />Yet it didn't bother me at all: perhaps it was Carter's mastery of language, or the fact that sensory pleasures are such an important part of the narratives, or perhaps such dense prose just works better in short-story form. Like eating dark chocolate or drinking red wine: you can't have too much of it, but it works extremely well in small doses.<br /><br />Exploring these stories on your own makes up most of the enjoyment of the book, so I won't give too much away in regards to the content of the stories. However, they range in length from the almost-novella size of the titular story \\"The Bloody Chamber\\", based on the story of Bluebeard and his murdered wives, to the page-long \\"The Snow Child\\", a sort-of inverse version of Snow White in which the maiden is born out of her father's desire as opposed to her mother's.<br /><br />There are the comparable \\"The Courtship of Mr Lyon\\" and \\"The Tiger's Bride,\\" both of which are based on Beauty and the Beast, and both providing alternative versions of the final metamorphosis scene for your consideration. These are followed by the only truly comedic effort in the collection, \\"Puss-in-Boots\\", narrated by the cat himself in raucous, witty prose as he helps his master win a lady's heart. If a cat could talk, it would sound like this, and he has some rather wonderful gems of wisdom to share: \\"All good women have a missionary streak, sir; convince her that her orifice is your salvation and she's yours.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Erl-King\\" and \\"The Lady of the House of Love\\" are stories centered around a mystical, powerful character; male in the former and female in the latter. Both are based not so much on fairytales as they are on the Germanic/Romanian legends of dark elves and vampires. As Helen Simpson puts it, in each story: \\"lovers are lethal, traditional romantic patterns kill, and sex leads to death.\\"<br /><br />Finally there is a \\"trilogy\\" of sorts that ends the collection: \\"The Werewolf,\\" \\"The Company of Wolves,\\" and \\"Wolf-Alice,\\" which deals with (obviously) the legend of the werewolf and the fairytale of Little Red Riding Hood.

B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|I was wary, had seen the \\"reboot\\" comments in a number of places.  You know what?  Yeah, it's a reboot.  So what?  The essence of the characters did not change, and in many cases was enhanced in a positive way.      This is a brilliantly written, directed, and acted film.  Why?  Because it does justice to the original, it leaves room for more, and it brings us back to the very heart of ST and the original crew.    Bravo, Mr. Abrams, Mr. Orci, and Mr. Kurtzman.

B001MS7IBS|5.0|I have dual suggestions for anyone thinking of trying FRINGE.  First, definitely watch it.  Second, be very, very patient.  The show eventually gets very, very good, but it takes a very long time to get there.  I have a theory as to why that is.  FOX has a tendency to micro manage many of its shows.  DOLLHOUSE is an example.  After Joss Whedon brought them his initial pilot, they nixed it and asked for a new one, and then dictated that the first several episodes be standalone episodes.  And guess what.  In the sixth episode DOLLHOUSE became one of the best shows on TV, with multiple delicious plot twists.  The weakest part of the series?  The first five stand alone episodes.  I have not heard similar things about FRINGE, but given that the first half of the season tends to be almost all stand alone episodes and that they are far and away the weakest part of the show, I suspect more FOX interference.  FRINGE has been compared to THE X-FILES in many ways, but one way that they are dissimilar is that THE X-FILES standalone episodes were far superior to FRINGE's standalone episodes.  So the viewer has to be patient for the payoff for watching the show to come to fruition.  But the payoff does finally come.  About halfway through the series a \\"mythology\\" arc emerges in a most satisfying way, resulting in a string of deeply satisfying and exciting episodes in the second half of the season.  At the end of the first year, it hasn't yet quite become a great show, but it shows all the potential of becoming one.  But perhaps only if FOX will get out of the way and let them get on with the story.<br /><br />The show also suffered from internal problems, the main one being casting.  I came to like Anna Torv in the lead role of Agent Olivia Dunham, but she remained in many ways the show's weak link.  Many fans noted that her American accent (Torv is Australian) often faded and especially early in the show her Aussie accent would briefly creep in.  She isn't a bad actress, but neither is she - comparing the show once again to THE X-FILES - Gillian Anderson, who was by any accounting a brilliant actress.  When I watch FRINGE, I often wonder just what the show would be like with a stronger actress in the lead role.  I also have not yet become sold on Joshua Jackson as Peter Bishop, but this may be far more of a problem with the writers fully integrating him into the show.  (Though the season ends with a great, great twist involving Peter that explains a lot of the background on Walter's story.)  Other than being Walter's son, his role in the greater scheme of things hasn't really become clear, though perhaps the writers envision a more crucial role in Season Two.  Lance Reddick is a powerful physical presence, but is another actor who has perhaps been under utilized at this point.<br /><br />Which leaves John Noble as Walter Bishop.  Is there a more delightful supporting character on TV?  He steals just about every scene he is in as the delightfully idiosyncratic and marvelously insane genius Walter Bishop.  Walter is both a wonderfully written character and brilliantly portrayed by Noble.  Sci-fi series do not as a rule get much recognition by the Emmys, but I would love to see Noble get a nomination for Best Supporting Actor in a Drama.  Many of the great moments of the show's first season revolve around Walter.  And there are so many fine Walter moments that some go unnoticed.  Among my favorites was in the show's penultimate episode where the crew is assembled in Walter's Harvard lab and someone says they need to turn the lights out.  Walter gleefully tells them all to hold on and he claps his hands, demonstrating that he has \\"the Clapper\\" installed in the lab.  But what makes the scene so funny is a very subtle bit of business.  Walter has been passing out cookies and has one of his own.  To be able to clap, he has set his own cookie down on the derri&egrave;re of the corpse he has been examining and that is laying immediately in front ofhim.  So while Walter is clapping his cookie is on this dead guy's rear end.  Typical Walter.  Not least because of Walter's penchant for blending the investigation of the most grotesque phenomena with food.  Icky disfigured corpse?  Nothing like that to get Walter to think about food!<br /><br />The best thing about FRINGE is that it got better as it went along.  This is a great sign for Season Two.  I blame FOX for the slow first half of the season.  Maybe I'm wrong in doing that, but we know for a fact that FOX messed up the first half of DOLLHOUSE, and they've been known to interfere with the development of other shows.  The fact is this:  executive producers and their writers know more about how to do a great show than network executives do.  Maybe they feel that they need to earn their salaries by \\"crafting\\" the new series, but generally what they do is mess things up.  You hire someone like J. J. Abrams or Joss Whedon to do a series, just get out of the way and let them do what they inevitably do better than you do.<br /><br />So definitely watch this show.  Be patient.  It starts off OK, but about halfway through the season it will really start to kick tail.  I think there is some core weakness in the cast, but not to the degree that it cripples the show.  Best of all, this show really feels like it is going somewhere special.  Make sure you are along for the ride.is clapping his cookie is on this dead guy's rear end.  Typical Walter.

B000F8O35U|5.0|I bought this edition of The Little Mermaid for my four-year old grandchild.  As usual,the DVD did not disappoint.  It is beautiful to watch and, of course, the songs were just as wonderful as they were years ago. The animation is wonderful and beautiful. I believe my granddaughter has watched it about five times in 3 days!  I would recommend this to any child 4 and over who loves Ariel and who loves music! It is still a Disney classic for the whole family.
B00008BRBG|5.0|I'm not going to read the other zillion reviews before I post, so forgive me if I say anything that has already been said.    Outlandos might be the most overlooked Police release by casual listeners.  Whatever it lacks in production technique it MORE than makes up in raw feeling and energy. Fans who stick to \\"greatest hits\\" releases are going to miss out.  Most albums/cd's have highlights and low points, but this CD like many Police releases is one you just have to play straight through...over and over.    If you lived through this time and bought it back in the day, then you are probably already aware of how important a release this was.  If not, I suggest you put this CD in your car and listen to it over and over.  Better yet, put it in your CD player at home because some of these songs make your feet just HAVE TO move which is not so good when driving.
0920668364|4.0|Love you forever is a good book but you have to be a mother or father with children of your own to really appreciate it. Since I am not married and do not haved children it's not one of my favorite reads. Most parents who I know, however, love it and start crying while they are in the process of reading the book.  I highly suggest buying it if you are or are soon to be a parent or you know someone who is. If you aren't a parent then you need to read the book first and judge for yourself.

B000066SJZ|4.0|Toto was in limbo when they recorded their fourth and best album, back in 1982. Having released a strong debut, their second & third were OK but far from brilliant. For their fourth effort though they stroke gold. With two pairs of golden ears behind the desk (Greg Ladanyi and Al Schmidt) and James Newton Howard being assigned the orchestral arrangements and conducting, Toto were set to deliver another massive production of an album. But what really made IV a soft rock masterpiece was the songs. Cleverly entrusting David Paich with more songwriting work, they scored big with \\"Africa\\" having earned another hit already with \\"Rosanna\\" (written for the actor Rosanna Arquete).    This edition is the first release of the album in glorious Super Audio CD. Being a Sony release, this was one of the first outputs in SACD's DSD format, therefore it lacks the CD layer losing the compatibility with traditional CD players. Though the hybrid version that followed is certainly the best buy, folks with SACD players will not miss the 16bit version. This remastered DSD version has more depth and detail than the original (compared to the vinyl version) but it feels a little excessive on the highs. And while the hybrid version is long gone and out of print, this DSD only version is a very good choice if one wants to listen to one of the greatest pop albums of the 1980's. If you lack the money to take a trip to Africa, this will compensate nicely.
B0011HF6GE|5.0|I really like this CD. It's very personal and mellow but Bon Iver has a great voice and it's not boring at all. Not whiney either, and has a folk kind of edge.  Bottom line: this CD has some excellent chill Sunday afternoon tracks.
0312360266|2.0|When I read the first line of this book, I was immediately interested and wanted to read more. By the end of the first paragraph, my interest was waning. By the end of the third page, the interest was pretty much gone.<br /><br />I will admit, I came upon this story after Twilight, and I hoped it would compare. It doesn't. Which would be fine if the book would have been good anyway--I'm an avid reader, Twilight was one of thousands of books I've enjoyed in my time.<br /><br />Some people have said Marked is an easy read, and I cannot agree with this. I consider an easy read a book that I breeze right through. It took me well over three weeks to read this book, simply because I couldn't force myself to read more than a couple chapters in one sitting.<br /><br />My biggest pet peeve about this book is that it's the result of a mother-young-daughter team--because it is glaringly apparent. The exaggerated innocence of teenagers is ridiculous. No, they are not all pot-smoking sex-having nymphos; however, Zoey's exaggerated disinterest is completely unbelievable. \\"OH MY GOSH! He is kissing me in front of the dorms--I AM A SLUT!\\"<br />The narratives are so much worse. Here is a fictitious example--but it would fit right in the book.<br />\\"And they had sex. (Now, I know society acts like all teenagers ever wanna do is have sex. Please. That is SO not true. In fact, teenagers don't even like sex. Really. Ever. It's so gross. I mean, ew.)\\"<br />It gets highly annoying.<br />Her first rant was tolerable and relatable, as it sounded like a teenager trying to convince their parent that they would never. Ever. Ever consider doing that bad thing that all the other kids are doing, but when it keeps happening it just gets annoying, and it's obvious that these parts are for Mommy Author's benefit. Many parts of the book just come off as a teenage girl trying to convince her mother that she is still her precious little girl and she promises not to grow up. Unfortunately, we (the reader) must be Mommy.<br /><br />Someone else remarked on this book's obvious sneer at Christianity--yeah. Kinda. The People of Faith (as the book calls them) are all bad guys, but this wasn't as annoying as the \\"innocent teenager\\" crap that colored Zoey's character.<br /><br />As far as the characters and the plot... maybe at 16 I would have enjoyed the simplicity, but I really didn't enjoy it as I read it. Everything was obvious. The characters didn't have a whole lot of dimension, and since it's a series I would need a lot more dimension to keep me buying the books.<br /><br />A couple of comments: the word \\"vamp\\" is used so much I found myself getting agitated every time I read it. Almost everyone famous you have ever known is a vamp. Kayla = obnoxious, and in no way convincing as a best friend at any point in the book.<br /><br />And Erik. I'm sorry, but not only is it obnoxious that he likes her on-sight, but he isn't interesting. At all.<br /><br />After forcing myself to read this book--it was hard to finish-- I finally got rewarded with a little bit of interest in the VERY LAST couple of chapters. My curiosity was actually aroused as to what happens in the next one, but I can't put myself through actually reading the books, so I think I'll just read some reviews of the next book and find out that way.<br /><br />Overall, there's too much explicit language and one sex-scene, so the book isn't mild enough for an 11 year old.<br />On the flip side, it isn't interesting enough and it's way too exaggerated for anyone much older to enjoy. I was going to give the book a two and a half, because it wasn't the worst book I've read, but... it just was NOT a good book at all.arked on this book's obvious sneer at Christianity--yeah. Kinda.

B001TH16DI|1.0|Avoid this set like the plague. These are the standard theatrical versions. I have the 10 movie set and love it. Star Trek is one of my favourite movie series ever and it makes me so mad that Paramount will undoubtedly release a set of the director's cuts in the near future. If not, it would be a big mistake. I love the director's cuts of the previous set as well as the features. Though I spent more than a hundred dollars for the last set on regular dvd, I would glady pay more for the set on blu-ray....as long as it had ALL the extra features and commentaries. Leave this set alone and hope that they put out director's cuts of the movies !
B000C20VPA|5.0|My favorite films range from gangster flicks (The Godfather 1 & 2), comic book adaptations (Batman '89), Sci-fi spectacles (2001: A Space Odyssey, Terminator 2: Judgement Day, The Thing), realistic thrillers (Collateral, No Country for Old Men), and animated classics (Fantasia, The Lion King). Casino is slowly being put on my list. This is a fantastic 178-minute film by Martin Scorsese, which is sadly underlooked. Maybe it's because it is quite similar to Goodfellas: two of the same cast members, same gangster themes, etc. But anyways, I seem to prefer this to Goodfellas, which is also a great movie. Here, we get to see some equally disturbing images (\\"In the end, I had to put his ****ing head in a vice\\") and a more excessive use of the F and S words (the F word being used 398 times in just under three hours).<br /><br />And not only that, we get to see some of the finest performances by De Niro, Stone, and Pesci. De Niro plays Sam Rothstein, one of the top handicappers in Las Vegas. As the owner of the fictional Tangiers casino who has connections with the Mafia, he looks to be an egotistical perfectionist, who treats his workers as if they're drug addicts. On the soft side, though, he is a caring family man who would do anything to protect his wife and child. De Niro should have at least been nominated for an oscar: here he is at the top of his game. He brings his trademark attitude into the picture, never losing his cool and never surrendering to overacting.<br /><br />You all know what Joe Pesci is capable of. Starring as Nicky Santoro, he is a hotheaded psychopath who relies on his balls instead of his head. He uses his explosively violent attitude to solve many of his problems, with disturbing and darkly hilarious results. I would NEVER want to confront a person like him. Pesci sure steals the show with his cursing and his aggressive personality, and he's clearly one of the reasons why I like Casino.<br /><br />I was never a fan of Sharon Stone, but she shines in this movie. She plays Rothstein's beautiful but obnoxious wife who takes her time smoking, drinking, taking pills, and embracing her husband's money. She is a woman that people love to hate, and she would care less what we all think of her.<br /><br />To be honest, what I like more than the performances is the overall flow of the film. This is half documentary, half mobster flick. Rothstein and Santoro become the narrators, and show us what happens in the Tangiers, and what sort of business they run. The narration may slow the film down a few times, but the information is just what we need in order to understand what type of people are running, and making money off of, the casino.<br /><br />In short, Casino is an excessively violent film with excessive profanity. Goodfellas may be the more popular film, but personally I have more admiration for Casino. Kudos to Scorsese, De Niro, Stone, Pesci, Rickles, Woods, and Vincent for making such a spectacular film.s Rothstein's beautiful but obnoxious wife who takes her time smoking, drinking, taking pills, and embracing her husband's money.

0385341008|5.0|Such a thoroughly enjoyable and charming book, if one can even imagine that a work about a subject as dark as a Nazi occupation can be described by these adjectives.  More powerful than the German soldiers who took control of the idyllic Channel island of Guernsey were the connections among a group of the most colorful, human, and endearing characters who could reside between two covers. This is the story of a young British author, Juliet Ashton, and her search for a topic for her new book. It is 1946 and war-torn England is working hard to pick herself up out of the rubble. Londoner Juliet receives an intriguing letter from a man named Dawsey Adams, a resident of the island, who was smitten by the work of the English romantic essayist Charles Lamb. His copy of Selected Essays of Elia  had by coincidence once belonged to Juliet; he had found her by discovering her name and address written inside the book.  Hence begins an intriguing string of correspondences between the islanders, who had inadvertently formed The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, and Juliet. The entire novel is written in letter format, which made me very nostalgic and desirous for the return of the elegantly hand- written letter. Learning about the brutal occupation through such idiosyncratic and disparate voices had me longing for membership in such a closely-knit caring community. This book also speaks to humor as well as beauty and human kindness as powerful weapons against the group mind, violence, and oppression. The love of reading and connecting to the human experience through books is a central theme.  I would recommend this book to every passionate reader and lover of books.

0743290119|1.0|This is perhaps the worst chick lit novel I've ever read. It's about 3 vapid girls with a superficial friendship characterized by secrets, petty jealousies, and insensitivity to each others' feelings (e.g., one girl gets dumped by her boyfriend of 5 years and the other 2 expect her to just get over it; she's not even allowed to talk about it). One of the characters, Adriana, is completely unlikeable. She's a vain, spoiled, self-centered bitch and it's unclear why the other girls like her at all. She certainly isn't a good friend b/c she's not particularly interested in anyone besides herself. The other two girls are one-dimensional stereotypes (a Type A overachiever, and a prim good-girl). These two have exciting, glamorous, successful careers, but they never talk about or celebrate that; they just whine about boys. And they're constantly obsessing about how \\"old\\" they are when they're only 29/30, with two of them freaking out because they don't have rocks on their fingers yet. In NYC, where I have lived for 10 years, girls don't hit the panic button just because they're not married by 30. It's perfectly normal to get married later here. And speaking of living in NYC, the character Lauren owns a one-bedroom apartment in a doorman building on the Upper East Side, and the author expects you to believe that Lauren got it \\"all through her own hard work and savings.\\" At age 29! When she works as a junior editor at a publishing house! That, dear readers, is financially impossible, I'm here to tell you. That apartment would cost, at a minimum, $450,000, so she would have had to have saved at least $45,000 for the down payment, plus be in a position to make payments on a $400,0000 mortgage plus monthly condo maintenance fees which would probably run between $800 and $1200 a month. Not possible on a junior editor's salary.  Anyway, don't waste your time with this book.
0689865384|5.0|\\"In a world of extreme beauty, anyone normal is ugly.\\"<br /> Uglies, by Scott Westerfeld, is addicting. A social satire/ sci-fi story that depicts a world where all people over the age of 16 are made super  perfect pretties, Uglies takes the concept of \\"fitting in\\" to the extreme. The main character, Tally, just wants to be a pretty, but then she meets Shay, who doesn't, and things change. When Shay runs away, Tally discovers that being pretty may not be so wonderful. She must traverse the land outside the cities, find Shay, and decide for herself if the life of a pretty is the life she wants.<br /> The combination of Tally's internal and external conflicts makes a fast, but not too fast-paced adventure filled with secrets, danger, and even some romance. Uglies sudo-future will appeal to anyone who loves The Giver.<br /> I loved this story.  The teenaged characters were easy to relate to and the drama kept me at the edge of my set. Tally's conflicts with her friends and her own desires mixed and blended until I had to try just as hard to come up with an answer as she did. I felt Tally's hurt at Shay's angry words, and her slight regret at her final decision, which is the main reason why at the end of the book I was left thinking, \\"What?

After reading it you can analyze people you know, or read about, and connect the dots on why/how they are successful.     What is scary to me is that you can take all of Gladwell's arguments and turn them around to make a very good argument on why certain people are unsuccessful!
B001TODCII|5.0|I love this movie. It got tons of action and twists that i like. I took my boyfriend to see it and he fell in love with it. So good, I had an adreline rush from it. But seriously it is such a good movie to watch.
0439023483|5.0|The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins, hardcover<br /><br /> Imagine growing up in an environment that suspects you to be enslaved and happy about it, an environment that might send a child off to die for other's amusement. The story starts out in a small poor village. The main character is a 16 old girl that is single handedly supporting her family. The tension begins when she explains The Hunger Games and how the system forces one boy and one girl to enter in to the Games, to fight to the death for the capital's amusement. These fights are not unlike the gladiators' but with children. This book is griping. A climactic story line, you will be glued to the story to the end.<br /><br />Mrs. Sage's Class<br /><br />Samuel
1577314808|5.0|This book, to put it simply, is changing my life.  I am so glad that Eckhart Tolle wrote this book because it has the potential to change so many people for the better.  It is written in plain English, in simple terms and every sentence is profound.  You cannot read this book without reflecting on your own life and acknowledging where changes need to be made.  Every person I know who has read this book feels the same way.  It really is an amazing book.  It is very deep and makes you think, so it can be slow reading at times, but is WELL worth the time if you have the patience and dedication to improving your life.  Really teaches you how to be fully aware and how to make the most out of every single day.  Nothing from your past can influence you RIGHT NOW unless you allow it.  Not only does this book show you how to create a positive future, but it also helps you (if you will) make peace with your past.  I cannot recommend this book more highly.  Hands down, the most influential book I have ever read.
B000B2YQX4|2.0|and to call it that is simply a huge overstatement.  The darkest album by Depeche Mode BY FAR is Black Celebration, a musical tour de force by a group that knew what they were doing.  This album is just so so.  Neither great, neither good, neither unlistenable.  It' just kind of \\"there\\". it has the big emotional hit that sounds like Depeche Mode still has it (Precious), but that's it.  I loved almost everything DM did up to their so so album Ultra.  In retrospect, I even liked that album more than I thought I did. But Exciter (just awful) and this thing....just not doing it for me.  I want DM to be great again.  They deserve it.  They have been around for THIRTY YEARS (which shows how long I've been a fan). And I want to like the new album Sounds of the Universe and give it a try, but from what I can tell by the singles and the samples, I might be dissapointed. I think I'll go into my time capsule now, close the door, and listen to Violater, Music for the Masses, and 101.

0140282033|4.0|I have been a fan of this story long before reading the book - and I have been a fan of Harris' other works long before reading this, so I am surprised that it has taken me this long to actually read this surprisingly brief novel. It is a very enjoyable read. And, surprisingly, I think that the movie was a pretty fair adaptation of it. I really like both the book and the film but for different reasons! And I am VERY curious about the sequel, [[ASIN:B0031RS56A The Lollipop Shoes (Chocolat 2)]]! This story didn't seem unfinished... but there are definitely some loose threads that I hope are taken care of in the next book! I am really surprised by the brevity of the novel, though - it has such a larger than life quality to many of the characters that I had expected more pages to be devoted to them.

031606792X|4.0|I think the books were extremely well written, easy to read and imagine the story. Maybe one could get really caught up in the tale and personalize it.. It was truly a beautiful expression of First True Love!! However I did grow tired of Bella's constant self sacrificing (overly explained)attitude. I got it in New Moon that she was completley in love with Edward however I did not get the feeling that she was as greatful for his love as he was for hers. Overall a very good read... the final installment went a little long but I understand the necessity to introduce the new character's for future novels...Completely looking forward to them, Meyer is my new favourite author!!!

0525421033|5.0|I couldn't put down this brief but incredibly moving teen novel about a girl who faces an unthinkable tragedy when her entire family (brother, mother and father) is killed in an automobile crash.  She hovers between life and death at the hospital, watching the activity around her as her grandparents, other relatives, and friends cluster around her hoping she will pull through.  Having lost her immediate family, does she want to continue living?  While this sounds like it might be an overly sentimental premise, the book paints a rich picture of the life of Mia, a talented cellist who lives for her music, through flashbacks which detail her life before the accident, particularly her relationship with her rocker boyfriend.  This novel is sure to appeal to readers who enjoyed novels such as Elsewhere by Gabrielle Zevin.
1933771690|5.0|This is just one more book within a growing number that connects the latest findings in science with what many ancient philosophers have already told us, reality is not \\"out there\\" it's in your head. We are not casualties of a random process, we are active participants of the process that creates 'reality'. Quantum mechanics has been undeniably showing us this for decades now. There's a major worldview shift coming and I believe it's long overdue.
B001TH16DI|4.0|I almost did not buy this based on the bad reviews of picture quality, what a mistake that would have been.  It looks great to me not sure what the problem is here. I have a 46 inch Sony XBR2 and it looks stunning.  They look waxy because they are caked with makeup to make them look younger.  It is just more noticeable in HD.  So I say go ahead and buy this and enjoy and stop listening to videophiles how will not be happy with anything.  I myself will enjoy this set while you other people are whining about nonsense.  I would have liked to have seen both versions of each film here so I give 4 stars.  I hate to say it but \\"Get a life people\\"
B000002OAZ|5.0|Set up the quintessential Bluesman with a band of fans that can play themselves (Eric Clapton, Bill Wyman, Charlie Watts and Steve Winwood) and you have a formula for success. This recording displays the mutual respect and abilities of a great group of musicians. You can hear the love as they play many standards in the storied history of Howlin' Wolf.    Recording quality is acceptable and the music laid down is exceptional. What is not to love?    I am glad I own it. Highly recommended.
1592402038|5.0|A fabulously witty book that still manages to be educational.  \\"Eats, Shoots & Leaves\\" is a must-read for those whose school days are a dim memory.  Do ellipses leave you puzzled?  How about dashes and brackets?  If so, have no fear.  Lynne Truss will set your punctuation quandaries straight with punctilious humor.<br /><br />Those of who are 'sticklers' can hold our heads high; we now have a champion who's not afraid to crack the whip on errant apostrophes and misplaced commas.  Ms. Truss' descriptive prose and laugh (or groan) out loud examples make this a laudable contender for \\"least boring book on punctuation\\" ever published.<br /><br />If you fume when you come across blatant errors in the books you read; if you've ever deleted an email because the sender didn't know the difference between they're/there/their; if you've actually offered to correct a restaurant's menu (is that just me?) - then you shouldn't miss adding this book to your library - or maybe leaving it casually on your desk for your illiterate boss to see?
0756405890|2.0|Rothfuss excels at getting other authors to write quotable comments about his book, but the problem with cover blurbs is the authors doing the quoting rarely, if ever, actually read the book they are commenting about. This tit for tat system was talked about in Library Journal recently and a great many authors admitted they never read the books they commented about. After reading Name of the Wind, I suspect that's the case here. I certainly would not give this book high marks; it does not deserve them. The writing it fraught with unforgivable flaws and creative lapses.    The characters are not solidly drawn or even interesting. With the exception of Kvothe, they seem random. The plot is strung together from coincidences and blantant contrivances. Like several other reviews, I became convinced the author had no idea what this book was supposed to be about and where it was going. It seemed to me key background details were simply repeated at times for no reason. This is a bad book and wholly unworthy of praise. I'd be ashamed to have my name on a book this bad.    The writing is as bland and lifeless as writing can be. I kept thinking how nice another tall tree or big building. How quaint that the author has no clue how to describe anything.    Plus has anyone else noticed the author is an egomaniac? No self love loss here.
B001WCN23W|4.0|Although I somewhat agree that it would be nice if more of an effort had went into the album art for these releases (and other band/artist releases in the past) does it really matter? I think not. The original cover art is intact but what matters is not the surface but the heart of the release: the music. Honestly how many times do you reach for a CD/album, put it into your player and bust out the booklet when you listen to it? I have maybe thumbed through booklets and liner notes once,twice at the most and never reached for it again getting the information that I needed out of them. are we music fans or little gimmicky marketing tool swag bell and whistle fans? Album cover art sadly died a painful death along with the record (vinyl) nearly 20 years ago. the important thing here is THE MUSIC and the fact that they even went out of their way to remaster it in 24 bit. considering the direction that music (downloading) is going. and with that in mind I am sure most record labels are finding it hard to justify spending the money for elaborate packaging when the percentage of listeners don't really care about cover art anymore. Long gone are the days of the Led Zeppelin III \\"pinwheel\\" art or Physical Graffiti gatefold \\"building and window\\" record sleeve covers. how many Iron Maiden fans have grown up listening to \\"Powerslave\\" not knowing that written in the stones of the temple are the words \\"Indiana Jones was here\\" or the image of Micky Mouse? Or the fact that the original album was in relief and you could feel the texture of the stones on the Pyramid? None of these things can translate to the size of CD booklets. And so this art has disappeared into Rock history along with many of the artists who pioneered album cover art and were once synonymous with them: Kelly Freas (Queen), Mouse (Grateful Dead, Steve Miller), Derek Riggs (Iron Maiden) Hypnosis (Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin), Roger Dean (Yes) and the list goes on. I would like to care but I'm finding it more satisfying to pick my battles when it comes to re-issues. No bonus tracks or a clever little zipper on the cover of Sticky Fingers but the sound is far superior to the release that came out 15 years ago? so be it. At least it still exists in a physical form. for now.to pick my battles when it comes to re-issues.

B001KVZ6F2|3.0|Here we have Clint Eastwood back in action, albeit at a more geriatric pace, giving his all in the role of a disillusioned, grumpy old geezer, having to  tolerate all the unpalatable social compromises that the modern world has imposed on him.  Where once he lived among his own folk, he now is surrounded by immigrants from the orient, with all the physical dilapidation that entails.  His one abiding passion is his somewhat unremarkable Gran Torino (GT) car - a survivor, like Clint himself, of better times.   All this is fine as far as it goes, but when he switches momentarily into the tough guy role, he somehow comes over more as a tough old fart than anything else.  This is really stretching things a bit far.   In fact, bearing in mind that Clint Eastwood, good as he has been in many roles, is not the kind of versatile actor that, say, Jack Nicholson is, does not really carry the character off with the same panache as Nicholson did in \\"About Schmidt.\\" There you had a slightly similar idea of a \\"senior citizen\\" bearing all the inconvenience of age on his back, but with infinitely more subtlety and humour than Clint achieves. Whereas Schmidt was wholly believable and touching, Clint's character left me cold and unconvinced.    If, however, you are a diehard Clint Eastwood fan, you won't be disappointed - as had been amply attested by most opinions on the film. It has a decent story line, well concluded, but for me it lacked conviction.
B001GCUNYO|1.0|THE MOVIE:  Watch Man On Fire or The Brave One instead. This is a sad, sad attempt to capitalize on the revenge movie genre. At no point can this movie ever be taken seriously. The dialogue is laughably convenient with the subtlety of a sledge hammer. Neeson's character is comically professional at what he does; remaining perfectly stone-faced and professional as his daughter is abducted and kidnapped. His character is beyond ridiculous and everything he says or does is utterly hilarious.     The beginning of the movie is exceptionally artificial and transparent because every scene is so clearly an excuse to bluntly tell you something about his character. NONE of it feels natural, which is okay on a certain level but the movie tries to take itself seriously and that's where it all falls apart.    The acting is pretty bad overall, despite many of the actors being very good in other movies. This is a sign of bad directing and bad editing. This is likely because the director's previous movie was District B-13; an enjoyable action movie that is very short and in which 2/3 of movie is action. The problem comes when this director tries to make an action movie with drama and everything falls apart.    The most important ingredient to a revenge movie is motivation and the movie just has none. Despite its many attempts to establish characters, I never felt anything for anyone, least of all the daughter. The only thing we have to go on is that they tell us the girl's his daughter and some nights he sits looking at childhood photos of her. There's no reason to care about her, especially when she blows off her father's heartfelt gift because her rich stepdaddy bought her a pony. That's right, a pony. Could it get anymore cliche?    Seeing a shallow, 60-year-old man brutally beat up and shoot countless people, only made worse by the juvenile directing and editing, was the source of immense hilarity to my friends and I. I don't know why Neeson doesn't turn and wink at the cameraspouting off lines like \\"[I'd sacrifice everything for her]\\", \\"[I'll tear down the Eifel Tower if I have to\\", and \\"[I could follow you across Europe. I'm very good at not being seen].\\" Neeson's attempt at the [Batman voice] was also hilarious; \\"WHERE'S MY DAUGHTER!\\" He's way above this material but even his acting is crap.     There's 0 drama in this despite the constant attempts to force it down your throat. In my mind, I cannot imagine anyone taking this movie seriously. It really is an unintentional parody of the highest calibur right up there with Wanted. I also can't believe this movie was written by Luc Besson. He has made excellent action films like Leon: The Professional, The Fifth Element, and Unleashed. It seems like a 12-year-old wrote this. Then again, he was involved in the Transporter movies and those are meh but at least they DON'T TAKE THEMSELVES SERIOUSLY.    Also, pretty much every time someone dies in the movie it's so poorly handled that it's to the point of parody. The shots he uses and the context of many of these are hilarious. Like a truck coming out of nowhere and running over someone, or showing a guy look through a port hole only to have Neeson pop into frame quickly and shoot the guy in the face through the port hole. Or the part that takes the cake is when Neeson quickly stands up and shoots an innocent woman in the arm... FOR NO REASON! Maybe in another context many of these things could have felt more natural, shocking, or interesting but it's all so hilarious here. I'm glad I didn't see this in the theater because I would have likely been kicked out for laughing so hard.    It's a terrible movie overall, but an excellent choice for a comedy rental but no one should ever own this trash.    THE BLU-RAY:  Picture quality and audio seemed very good. Extras are meh but I guess that depends whether or not you like the movie and are interested in the commentaries and the small amount of behind the scenes material.
0446677450|3.0|I just finished reading Rich Dad, Poor Dad (and probably spent way too much money but that's beside the point). It's a great book with lots of financial tips and advice. However, a lot of it has to do with just plain old common sense. Spend less than you earn, save money, and invest wisely. That's all there is to it.<br /><br />I'm a bit skeptical on Robert's brilliant memory...a lot of the recollection he had when he was younger sounds more like a script for a drama than an actual conversation between a young child and grown adult. I'm also skeptical on the house ownership being a liability, than an asset. Wouldn't that fall under the real estate investments he often talks about in the book? It doesn't matter if you own land, buildings, etc...you still pay taxes on it. I'm also still not sure how $2K monthly in assets and $2K montly in liabilities makes one wealthy. According to my calculations, that makes one broke.<br /><br />I, for one, don't buy his 'Don't go to school' advice. My college degree has paved the way for many opportunities; one of them being around rich and wealthy people who gave me excellent financial tips, and which I'm still generating much income today as a result. Do not knock the value of an education and what it can do.<br /><br />So I do recommend the book, but keep an open mind and don't take everything he says to heart. Don't just quit your job the next day unless you have a plan as to what you want to do.
B0012QE4Q2|1.0|I thought I'd enjoy this movie, even if the plot was bad, and I do give it one star for at least having beautiful actors,settings, and costumes.  In every other way, however, The Other Boleyn Girl absolutely reeks.  The actors try hard, but the plot and script give them no room to display their considerable talents.  The character of Henry VIII is neither historically accurate nor consistent within the movie itself.  \\"Mary Boleyn\\" (Scarlet Johansen) is a sap who moves out of Henry's bed without a murmer, so that her sister can take her place.  \\"Anne Boleyn\\" (Natalie Portman) is a brazen hussy who gives the king and his assembled court a lecture and brags about using \\"[my] thighs\\" to stay on her horse.  Viewers are apparently expected to first despise Anne for her ruthless ambition, and then feel sorry for her downfall.  (Although I have to say that Portman and Johansen salvage everything possible from Anne's execution scene, rendering it poetic and poignant.)  Somebody edited this film with a hacksaw; Mary's husband simply disappears, although one of the special features clues us in that there was originally a scene where he dies.  Truly dreadful, a waste of the actors' time and talent and your money.
1905654294|5.0|I was never sure what it was about this series that drew me in. I read Twilight somewhat unwillingly and had mixed reactions to it as well as New Moon and Eclipse, though each one did seem to get a little better; a little more grounded in real emotion. To this point I hadn't found anything particularly literary about the Twilight Saga, it was more the hidden 12-year-old girl inside of me that loved the books, the more analytical adult in me was horrified throughout much of the books. Now I know Stepehenie Meyer was building up to something. Something amazing.    Breaking Dawn is divided into three books and, unlike so many books in this format, each really could be a different book. One of these books is told from Jacob's perspective, much like the epilogue at the end of Eclipse, which was a particularly fascinating move on the part of Meyer. At first it was somewhat jarring to realize I was about to read 200+ pages in a different voice than Bella's, which I had become so used to, but it ended up being my favorite section of the book. It was a genius move on Meyer's part, had we been trapped reading the events Jacob chronicles for us from Bella's point of view, it certainly would have seemed like more of the same. Getting a new and unique perspective on things at a crucial plot turn left the book feeling fresh and helped to reinvigorate me for the end.    As to plot, there's not much that can be said that would not end up spoiling something important. Impressively, all the questions I had before beginning, were answered by the end, as well as some questions I didn't know I should be asking. Many of the plot twists felt unique this time, something different than the usual vampire story or love triangle. By the middle of the book, some relationships had changed in such a drastic way, I was ravenous to see how it would all turn out.    If you have been avoiding this series or tried it and put it away disappointed, I would encourage you to give it another shot. The pathto reach Breaking Dawn was at times tedious, and at times frustrating, but having reached the end of Bella's story, I'm glad I gave it the time.
1416550542|4.0|Kate Morton sent herself a high bar with \\"The House at Riverton\\" and she delivers. The Forgotten Garden is a wonderful and engaging tale with, just like The House at Riverton, a gripping mystery just below the surface.    Spanning a period of just over 100 years, Kate spins a tale about a young girl, Nell, who mysteriously appears on a dock in Australia. Gently pealing back the layers of mystery we follow her and her ancestors and descendants backwards and forwards to London and Cornwall. The mystery is, like with The Forgotten Garden, not that hard to spot - and, indeed, is revealed with a fair amount of the book left untravelled. But it is the beautiful writing, the strong characters and their motivations that keep the reader fully entertained and engaged.    This is highly recommended.

B000ICL3KG|1.0|This film did not show me any 'proof' or a single piece of evidence that man's CO2 is causing warming or the current cooling !    FACTS:    Did you know: Ever since the GLOBAL WARMING  issue was raised, there came an agreement among the UN that countries emitting high levels of CO2 must PAY a considerable amount as penalty, and US being first in rank pays the HIGHEST PENALTY (this means additional payment in taxes)  There was a time in the EARTH'S HISTORY probably billions of years ago, CO2 levels were considerably high, yet the EARTH WAS AS COLD AS ICE, and take note, THERE WERE NO PLANTS AT THAT TIME to feed off the CO2   ... and there's more to come ... the IPCC wants $4,000,000,000,000 per annum in carbon taxes ... that's 100 times the profit of the world's biggest company .... very tempting eh ?    All this to stop a warming of 0.006 degrees per annum ... that isn't happening and hasn't happened for ten years !     Bottom line, don't give in to the all the global warming hype.  Think for yourselves!
B001DSNEJM|3.0|paul walker does an alright job in this movie as ben. He is trying to go straight in life after prison , but his brother talks him back into a burglary for gold dust.       Things change after he is caught in the act of the crime, and sentenced to death.         Towards the end of it all he regains his mind and finds out that he is not really out of his mind he has just been lied to about being a grounds keeper in oregon. He gets the purps back by copying their documents of the operation and mailing them off to the authorities, and removing the implant out of his arm that keeps him thinking he's insane.          Walker then leaves the institution and goes back home to his family.         This movie could have been alot better a more detailed plot, and more star actors.
B00005JKHP|5.0|My kids adored watching this, and I must say that I found the movie much more enjoyable in this format than I did in theaters when it first came out.  Listening to it as my kids watched it on the DVD player in our van, I realized for the first time that the music from this movie gave rise to the theme music for \\"Next Generation.\\"  (Okay, so I'm slow on the uptake these days!)  The extra features are a lot of fun, and we've really enjoyed watching them as a family, introducing a new generation to the wonders of _Star Trek_.
0545128285|4.0|I loved it! This showed up in my Easter basket today (apparently the Easter bunny still visits me, despite the fact that I'm 26) and I read it in just about an hour. It made me laugh out loud several times, generally when reading the commentary from Dumbledore. It was nice to read some Wizarding fairytales; very enjoyable.<br />So basically, what I have to say about this book is: \\"Damn you, J.K. Rowling! You did it again! I hate that I love your books!\\"
B001TODCII|5.0|The only thing I can say about this movie is one word.  FANTASTIC!  The acting is superb(especially Neeson) and the plot leaves you gasping with the non-stop excitement.  There is never a dull moment in it and the ending is great.  If you purchase one movie this year, make it this one.
B001GCUNYO|5.0|Liam Neeson at his best! He is every Dad's hero.  A man of his word, he is strong, skilled, smart and will never give up. Liam is as good or better than his performance in Batman Begins. Subject matter will keep your daughter home without you having to say a word! The action,the story, and drama is on par with the best movies ever. Rent it, but you'll want to buy it.  Let's hope that they bring Liam's character back for a sequel!
B001PPLIEG|3.0|When Casino Royale (2006) came out, I thought it was the best James Bond film I'd ever seen with Daniel Craig easily (in my opinion) the best Bond in the franchise history (yes, even better than Connery). So, needless to say I was really looking forward to Quantum of Solace. Unfortunately, like a lot of people I was underwhelmed at best.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, this film has arguably the best filmed action scenes this side of 'Dark Knight' as well as some very creative moments in the best of Bond fashion (one particular involves Bond with a camera inside a new-age opera house).<br /><br />Daniel Craig and Judy Dench are still fantastic in their roles, but where this film seemed to fall short was giving you a reason to care about them. Bond always seems to come off cold and crude (though does have a few amusing one-liners), and M seems to be changing her mind a few times too many regarding her best agent. The other characters are a bit too unimportant or underused to really feel a \\"bond\\" with them ( I liked the return of Mathes but he TOO left the screen a bit too early). I'm not even going to comment on the villian.<br /><br />The film's plot ranges from dry to needlessly complex but I realize you don't see a Bond film for the story. I did like how it did bring closure to the events from Casino Royale at the end, so in that and the incredibly well staged action scenes the film is still worth seeing at least once. I just wish this movie had more going for it.
B00005AG7K|4.0|I watched this last night for the seventh time and it seems more charming with each viewing. The Beatles are very relaxed and there are many young children having fun along the way. It has its share of strange British humor but some of the filming is inspired and the song video of \\"Walrus\\" is top notch. Give it a try.
B001TODCII|5.0|This is one of those great action movies where the hero isn't burdened by doubt, ineptitude, or guilt.  He knows what he has to do and he does it coolly and ruthlessly!  What he does is kill bad guys...  Lots and lots of bad guys of all nationalities, races, and creeds who deserve what they get.  Very efficient and ecumenical...      I lost count, but Liam Neeson must have killed about 50 bad guys in this one.  And they keep on spawning so he has more to kill.  I haven't seen one hero take on so many bad guys who keep on reproducing since Steven Segal made \\"Hard to Kill\\"...        The action is non-stop and the retribution is very satisfying.  There is a lot of violence, but this is not an explicit blood and gore film.  Just good old Hollywood movie violence that hits you at the gut level.  \\"Taken\\" is a nice vicarious vigilante thrill for all the rest of us who must play by the rules.  Liam Neeson does an excellent job!  Highly recommended for action fans...
B001FB4VZS|4.0|Season 8 of \\"Smallville\\" had a lot of things going against it when it premiered in the fall of 2008. It had lost some major cast members. Michael Rosenbaum(Lex Luthor), and Kristin Kreuk(Lana Lang), did not return as cast members. If that weren't a big enough bomb being dropped on the show, the series' creators and runners, Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, also left the show after the seventh season. Everybody was jumping ship, and I, as well as many other fans and critics, worried and wondering how the show would be without these major factors. How will it go on?. How will it work?. Will it be any good?. Throw in the news that two new characters would be added to the mix, and Justin Hartley would be upgraded as a regular cast member as Oliver Queen/Green Arrow, and you had a new season that had many fans curious...and worried.    Season 8(and I will be as spoiler free as I can)continues Clark Kent's path to becoming Superman, and we are getting closer and closer. He now works at The Daily Planet with Lois Lane(Erica Durance) and Jimmy Olsen(Aaron Ashmore), who is taking the next step in his relationship with Chloe(Allison Mack). Lex Luthor has mysteriously vanished, and in his place comes Tess Mercer(Cassidy Freeman)to run things. If Tess knows Lex and is running his business and living in his mansion, can she be trusted?. Elsewhere, we are also introduced to paramedic Davis Bloome(Sam Witwer), who is holding a deep, dark secret of his own.    Okay, so after the fears and worries about season 8, how is it?. I am happy to say that fans' worries should be put to rest. Season 8 starts off a little rocky, a little unsure, but after a few episodes it really grabs hold of it's new storylines, characters, and just goes to town with it. The good news is that not only does it work, it works like gangbusters. The inclusion of villain Doomsday to the show was a great idea. The monster and his identity has been a fantastic surprise, and the monster himself is so cool and has a strong, powerful presence of evil that hasn't really quite been seen on the show. Chloe suddenly gets involved, and it goes to another level. There are a number of things going on, and it all gels. Al and Miles shouldn't worry. Their baby is in good hands. The Doomsday/Chloe/Clark thing is one of the best story arcs the show has had. I loved the last 2 seasons, but this storyline trumps those. There is a level of real danger this year, and it has sent the show some surprising shocks and surprises, not to mention pushing characters in new and surprising directions. Elsewhere, the show plays with the relationship between Clark and Lois. This also works really well. Tom Welling and Erica Durance have unbelieveable chemistry, and the sparks just fly whenever they are together. What ultimately happens between them remains to be seen, but I look forward to finding out. And for you Lana fans, yes, she does appear. Kristin Kreuk appears in five episodes, beginning with \\"Bride\\", and continues in \\"Legion\\", \\"Bulletproof\\", \\"Power\\", and \\"Requiem\\". But season 8 also belongs to Chloe as much as it does Clark. She has a lot of heavy stuff this year, and has gone through more than probably anybody else. What are the negatives?. Not much. I have never been a fan of Oliver Queen/Green Arrow, and I don't see adding Justin Hartley as a regular of really bringing much to the table. It seems like he and Clark have the same discussion a lot of the time.    The episodes themselves are a lot of fun, and the season has a much darker tone this year than in seasons past. It begins with \\"Odyssey\\", which is a typical big Smallville premiere. Other highlights include \\"Commited\\", where Lois and Clark have to pose as a couple working on a case. \\"Bloodline\\" sees the return of cousin Kara(Laura Vandervoort)and the phantom zone. \\"Bride\\" is a biggie. Doomsday makes his big introduction to the gang during Jimmy and Chloe's wedding day. \\"Legion\\" features the, well, Legion, who help Clark with Chloe when Brainiac takes her over. \\"Infamous\\" sees the return of Tori Spelling(as hammy as ever)as gossip columnist Linda Lake. \\"Beast\\" and \\"Injustice\\" ramp up the series towards it's big finale, \\"Doomsday\\", which will be airing tomorrow night.    \\"Smallville\\" has had a creative re-birth in season 8. Not many shows can say that in their eighth season, but the new additions to the show have brought with them some very interesting new kinks in the story. The Doomsday storyline, and the complications with Chloe, have been some of the more interesting stuff the show has done. There are surprises, shocks, and characters being severely tested. While it would be nice for Lex and Lana to still be around, I have found myself really getting into this season's story, and I have not missed them. If the show can still be this good and entertaining with new producers and the loss of some favorite characters, while throwing in new dimensions for the story and characters, we should have nothing to worry about with season 9. Smallville is still flying high with one of it's most interesting seasons to date.

B001GCUNYO|5.0|Taken is by far one of the best movies of all time.  I know that is a bold statement to make, but I really feel it to be true.  Liam Neeson could not have done a better job in this film.  The action scenes are brilliant, and leave you wanting more yet satisfied all at the same time.  Taken is a movie that is not only worth renting...but buying.  As soon as I saw it in theatres I knew I had to buy it, and as soon as I got off work today...I did.  Amazing movie...buy it...NOW!!!
B001TODCII|4.0|\\"Taken\\" is one of those action thrillers with a main character who is or was a double-dog secret government wreaker of mayhem.  Written by Luc Besson, who also made \\"Leon: The Professional\\", \\"La Femme Nikita\\" and \\"The Transporter,\\" you go into this film expecting that there will be several scenes featuring our hero single-handedly taking on a room full of bad guys and, as my Granny used to say, whuppin' the tar out of them.  Actually - he does more than whup most of them.  Most wind up looking pretty dead, although no one stops to check for a pulse once the bodies start piling up.<br /><br />The distinguishing characteristic \\"Taken\\" has over its brethren is the star.  Instead of Jason Statham or The Rock (20 years ago it would have been Steven Seagal or Jean-Claude Van Damme), \\"Taken\\" stars lauded Irishman Liam Neeson.  The guy who played Schindler brings a degree of gravitas to a role not yet earned by most action stars.  There's a reason he provides the voice of Aslan in the Narnia films.<br /><br />In this film he plays Bryan Mills, who spent most of his married life on the road doing secret C.I.A. stuff, and enjoying it, but neglected his wife and daughter.  As a consequence Lenore (played by Famke Janssen) is now his ex-wife, and daughter Kim (Maggie Grace from \\"Lost\\") lives with mom and new step-dad, a super-rich businessman.<br /><br />Bryan regrets not being a better Dad and husband, so he has retired from the agency and moved near Kimmy, but when Kim lives in a mansion worthy of an NFL owner, it's tough for Bryan to compete for Kim's affection.<br /><br />Kim is invited with a friend on a Paris vacation and Mom pressures Bryan to sign the necessary forms so that Kim can leave the country.  After years of dealing with the world's shady characters, Bryan is reluctant, but signs the forms after giving Kim a few rules - mainly to stay in touch with an international cell phone Bryan gives her.<br /><br />Kim is in her opulent Paris digs for all of about an hour before Albanian drug and prostitute slave traders break into the apartment.  Dad is on the phone chastising Kim as the bad guys break in, and Bryan is able to piece together a few pieces of information when he tells Kim to give him as much description as she can before she is kidnapped.<br /><br />The rest of the movie consists of Bryan tearing apart Paris, one room of bad guys at a time.  At least four times he strolls casually into a situation surrounded by four or more baddies, and after the first few times the Mrs. and I would turn to each other and predict \\"I think THOSE guys are about to have a BAD day\\" each subsequent time he encountered more eurotrashy guys.<br /><br />At an hour and a half, Besson and director Pierre Morel keep the pace at a level that barely gives you time to catch your breath.  It's entertaining in a Bourne kind of way, and it makes me feel better seeing a man ten years my senior able to whup the tar out of a hundred bad guys.e traders break into the apartment.

And I liked it, despite expecting not to.<br /><br />I love the off-beat humor of this movie. The editing and cinematography were what made the movie fantastic, though. The music helped quite a bit as well.<br /><br />This movie reminded me a little of Napoleon Dynamite and a little of Lars and the Real Girl -- but overall it is one of a kind and definitely worth a viewing.
B0011NVC9I|2.0|I had heard that this \\"movie\\" was CGI, so it was not a surprise to me when I saw it. Still, I must say I was disappointed with it for the very reason that it was CGI. Maybe I'm old fashioned but I like real people, real actors, real sets and real action. Cartoons are fine for Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck, but why for a movie like this? I don't get it. I can't help but think what the result would have been if Casablanca were a made as a CGI cartoon, or High Noon or Indiana Jones. Of course the story itself is a classic. So there is no fault with the material. I just don't particularly care for CGI for the characters or sets. It has it's place, to enhance some scenes, but as the main element - thank you No. I feel like I've been shorted on the real movie experience.
B00005QIPH|4.0|With the virtual rebirth of  instant indie super-stardom, you could bet this NY retro-chic rock debut was heavily debated on quality from the get go. The tinny hipster production can wear thin, but often catches the band in striking reach when melodics flow properly, which they usually do, deceptively underneath calculatedly fuzzed-out aesthetics.

B000002C2E|3.0|3 1/2    Strong comeback which helped Dylan regain some relevance isn't completely unique, as it does rehash a few tired blues themes repeatedly, but with at least half the disc offering positive new compositions guided by absolutely accentuating production, even the extended rambler of Highlands makes sonic sense when through the throaty cynicism of our lead.
0312427999|5.0|When asked early in his presidential administration who most influenced him, President Ronald Reagan told inquiring journalists: Frederick Bastiat.<br /><br />A contemporary of Alex De Toqueville, Frederick Bastiat laid the intellectual goundwork for what would later become the foundational principles of the Libertarian Party and also supply side economics.<br /><br />If workers have labored to create wealth, Bastiat argued, who was government to come forward and dispossess them of the fruit of their labors?<br /><br />Enter Milton Friedman and the Chicago Economic School. In reply to the economic philosophy of John Maynard Keynes, Friedman took the position that aggressive taxing of the wealth to assist the needy was not only bad economic policy but contrary to the foundational principles of democracy itself.<br /><br />And like all theories all it really amounted to was an argument on behalf of someone to get something. In this case, the someones were wealthy corporations who were looking to make even more flush their bottom lines at the expense of the little guy.<br /><br />In this stunning book, Klein makes clear that starting with the Augustin Pinochet take over of Chile Chicago style economics was behind every major screw job commited against every distressed populace through the Bush II administration. She made the point that Chicago economists would sit like vultures awaiting a crisis which would then be used as the basis for government crackdown and instution of policies that were uniquely designed to make the rich richer.<br /><br />After reading this book I don't know if I'm fully convinced that Friedman and his school were as bad as advertised but I am convinced that not only was Bastiat right that the government shouldn't rob people of their hard won wealth for its own sake but it shouldn't rob them on behalf of big business either.
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|One of the few graceful big pressure indie sophomores that felt slightly compromised from one perspective, but enhanced in the next. The kind of follow up that does refine some of the grittier urgencies which made the debut stick out but in trade gets expansive production and refined compositions. Unfortunately it could have even been better had they spent the time end it properly, and by that I mean it was too short only just over a half hour with the wrong closer.
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|Okay. How do you re-imagine STAR TREK, one of the largest sci-fi franchises in the world, and do it without alienating the \\"trekkies\\" and, at the same time, not lose an audience of new watchers who may not be that familiar with it?<br /><br />The first thing you do is hire J.J. Abrams, the genius behind the LOST series on TV. Abrams is making a serious name for himself in Hollywood, and it took some serious c@hones to take on a project that could literally blow up in his face. Re-imagining Star Trek with an all-new cast and a new storyline was seriously risky ...but the risk has paid off big time.<br /><br />The thing Abrams seems to be aware of is that entertainment (be they TV or big screen) is ALL ABOUT THE CHARACTERS. Let me say that again in case you missed it: entertainment is ALL ABOUT THE CHARACTERS. You can have action, adventure, cool CGI, but it's how the characters respond to such things that pull the audience in, and Abrams has done that with extreme care here.<br /><br />Undoubtedly, however, some trekkies are gonna be seriously pi$$ed about this. Much has been altered (by way of time travel ...but that's the only semi-spoiler I'll give) and the new Kirk (Chris Pine, [[ASIN:B000O77SF4 Smokin' Aces]]), Spock (Zachary Quinto, [[ASIN:B0014BJ16S 24]]), Bones (Karl Urban, [[ASIN:B000X9FLKM The Lord of the Rings]]) and the rest are only shadows of what they once were on TV. Even so, there are plenty of inside jokes for trekkies to enjoy (\\"I'm a doctor not a physicist!\\"), including finding out if Kirk always does get \\"the green chick,\\" Chekov's (Anton Yelchin) battle with his accent and the computer recognizing him, and Sulu's (John Cho) fighting abilities. The other thing that'll rankle true trekkies is Spock's emotional state. But let's remember that Spock is half-human, and always battled with his emotions, from the beginning of the series and even on in to The Next Generation where another Vulcan (Sarek) gives over his weakening emotional thoughts to Captain Picard so that he can finish negotiations.<br /><br />The great thing about this newest version is that it relaunches Star Trek when it was headed downhill. The Next Generation is dead. ENTERPRISE is ...not good. DEEP SPACE 9 has been ousted for some time. And no new films with older cast members were in the works. So, although trekkies might \\"hate\\" what's been done to their beloved series, they won't bemoan the possibility that this newest version will bring in fresh blood to their ranks. But is that enough? No.<br /><br />What Abrams and the rest did was incorporate just enough of what made the classic Star Trek part of our culture (honestly, who doesn't know where the term, \\"Live long and prosper\\" came from) while giving us an action-packed, summer popcorn movie that'll please just about anyone. And I say this with all sincerity. When I went to the theater, there were teenagers and octogenarians in the audience. In fact, a buddy I went with brought his mother and grandmother, and they both loved it! Quite an accomplishment.<br /><br />This one's a sure winner. And I noticed that another film is in the works for 2011. Let's hope this new series truly does live long and prosper.an finish negotiations.

055357342X|5.0|I have just finished reading the whole \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" saga cover to cover. It took me about 3-4 months and the stroy did not lose its grip at any point. I was compelled to keep going till I knew and understood more and more about the characters, and the narrative revealed itself during this process.<br />What more is there to say? Just that it is a true literary achievement, by any standard.<br /><br />I do have only one slight \\"complaint\\". As you read the three books consecutively you notice that Martin does not change his writing technic regarding the timeline of the chapters themselves. Each one of them is opened in the wake of a recent activity which was implied to in a preceding chapter (of the same character). Then, after a page or two the narrator flashbacks and speaks of that recent activity. What we have in the end is an ever recurring cycle of:<br />Present-> Flashback (recent past)-> develpoing present...<br />I am positive that had Mr. Martin wanted to be more versatile regarding the structure of the narrative he would have added to the saga a new dimension, which would have kept the readers on their toes, a bit more.

0756405890|1.0|Before reading this book, I'd never encountered anything so poorly done I felt I had to write a review to set the record straight. When I finished this book, I took a second look at the reviews and couldn't believe we'd read the same book. I thought surely there must be another book called \\"The Name of the Wind\\" and surely that was the book everyone was praising because the book I read was in no way praiseworthy.     I asked around at the bookstore and the library about this book. The only helpful and honest comments were from a librarian who told me Rothfuss was like Newcomb. His publisher pulled strings to get him praise by telling everyone this was the hot new book of the year and once they do that everyone wants to comment on the book as this helps to sell Rothfuss's book and books by the authors who made the comments. Understanding how the process worked she was more cynical about this book than I was and she added they didn't shelve it and likely never would. Rothfuss in her mind hadn't earned the right to be shelved.    Advice like that would have saved me. It would have been nice to know this was a pass before wasting money on it. What really made me mad was the wasted time. Reading a book should never feel like a complete waste of time. This was a complete waste of time. Just seems I was steered wrong on this one. It gives heartburn thinking about it. My husband got laid off too and $24.95 for the hardcover was big money but I thought we both deserved a treat. I couldn't have been more wrong.     Suffice to say I wasn't impressed. For my taste, and for many others I've spoken with, the writing is extremely mediocre and cliches abound. There are many parts that are cringeworthy -- I actually made faces the writing was so bad.     Disguising this very weakly, very poorly told story as a \\"tale being told\\" obviously was a ploy to save the novel from a few more rounds of rewrites. Instead of developing defensive Amazon personas, Rothfuss should have spent his time rewriting. He would have had a better novel, and perhaps one worthy of some modest praise.     After seeing the frenzy of reviews today to push all the honest reviews off the product page, I am extremely disappointed and even more appalled by the author's strong arm-tactics.

Let's admit it, sometimes DM can put some cheesy songs up like \\"Condemnation\\" for example.  But on every album there are a few songs you know you will listen to for the rest of your life.  This album unfortunately has too many that I would very likely forget as well.  But I have also noticed that Depeche Mode songs can grow on you years later.  I can tell you that my favorite Violator song now is Sweetest Perfection and I would I have told you back then that it was the one I hated the most.      My biggest problem with the album is the way it sounds...  You can better production from Indie Rock bands these days.  That blippy loopy Atari sound they used seems immature.  And I think its lyrically poor..  Lots of Wrong this Wrong that in umm..  Wrong.  But they still have amazing voices (Dave and Martin) and you'll have a blast with whatever songs you do like for that reason.  I think a true Depeche Mode fan buys this album at least out of nostalgia and to pick up a few more personal classic DM songs.

I thought I was going to die but then went right out bought my own copy and  have been doing this video for about 6 weeks about 3 times per week (my packed schedule doesn't allow me to do it everyday) and I have seen huge improvements in my strength, endurance, and I just feel great all over. I am on Day 5 of Level 2 and I feel myself improving each time. I like that Jillian pushes you and helps you feel like you really can get through the excercises.  The fact that you can't skip the first two minutes of introductions on the DVD and go straight the start menu is annoying so I just turn the DVD on while I am still getting my workout gear and sneakers on so that I am just not standing there wasting time.  Overall, this is a great workout and if you really push yourself, you will see results right away.

B001U7NW0C|3.0|If your a super fan of the television show Will & Grace, then probably already own the season DVDs, but if you happen to be a casual fan or if your curious to see what the show is all about, then these Best of DVDs are perfect.  If you are one of the preivious mentioned television nerds that are curious to find out more about this series let me give you the rundown.  Grace Adler (Debra Messing) is an interior designer that has a creepy best friend relationship with gay lawyer Will (Eric McCormack).  Will hangs out with super flaming gay man Jack (Sean Hayes), and all of them are tormented by rich drunk Karen (Megan Mullally).  This group of misfits share the everyday challenges of everyday life in New York City.<br /><br />This collection is great for the casual fan, but probably not worth it for the shows real fans.  These discs offer a glimpse into the history of the show and for the most part they get it right.  Love & Marriage has part one of the episode Cheaters which I found odd because after watching it I wanted to see part 2, but it wasn't on the disc.  I personally enjoyed the Friends & Foes collection better than the Love & Marriage one, I found the episodes were funnier and packed a bit more punch.<br /><br />Overall these collections are pretty cool and priced perfectly for the casual fan that wants to enjoy the show without dropping the coin for the series box sets.

1559408855|2.0|Pasolini's \\"Salo\\" is indeed a disturbing, disgusting, slightly demented film.  It's very hard to watch.  I'm not sure how someone can watch it without gagging at least once.  Yet, for all its shock value and brooding representation of the evil and corrupt, is it really the best way to explore how evil human beings can be? No.    Personally, I found Alain Resnais' Holocaust documentary \\"Night and Fog\\" to be much harder to watch than \\"Salo.\\" That film doesn't need to depict copography to turn your stomach.  It need only show you the aftermatch of the atrocities at Auschwitz and Majdanek to widen your eyes in horror.    Or, if you're willing to subject yourself to a truly horrific film, look no further than \\"Men Behind the Sun\\", which documents the Japanese occupation of China during the Second World War.  In my opinion, \\"Men Behind the Sun\\" is both a more brutal and a more important film to see if you really want to educate yourself.  Both films depict true (or mostly true) events, but I think you'll find that \\"Men Behind the Sun\\" is a great deal harder to watch than \\"Salo.\\"    --------------------------------------------------------------------------    NOTE: as I'm sure you're all aware, there are several bootleg copies of \\"Salo\\" on the market.  If you buy a copy from a third party (meaning the Amazon marketplace), be aware of the differences between a genuine copy and a bootleg.  You can search for such differences online.
B001KEGRC0|5.0|I also originally saw this film in IMAX 3D in Seattle as a parent chaperone with my son's second grade class. You know something is truly magical and amazing when it not only has all the adults in the room on the edge of their seats with mouths half agape, but a bunch of 7- and 8-year-olds in exactly the same position. Not only that, but the film's  powerful message, perfectly chosen and choreographed soundtrack, and absolutely breathtaking cinematography were not lost on anyone - the kids wanted to go to the Grand Canyon and save the river afterwards. My son still talks about it nearly a year and a half later.  If I could give this film more than five stars, I would.  Neither you (nor your children)will be disappointed in this amazing show.

Is it because people like cookie-cutter, trite songs that they've heard done 120 different ways? I'd like not to think so, but maybe.      His songwriting skills on this album are weak at best.  These sort of lyrics are so overdone, so common to the genre, and so shallow, it's nauseating.  Sure, I suppose his songs are \\"pretty,\\" or whatever the usual reaction is, but what do they really say? Absolutely nothing.  There is no depth to these lyrics at all, and they're extremely repetitive.      If he ever manages to write some decent songs, he'll be fantastic.  That voice is undeniably strong.  Until then, there are much better options available to you.

B00070Q7VO|4.0|Love this CD.  I had heard his music on a PBS concert program and loved his voice.  Did not know much of his music but this CD has some remakes that sound great!  If you like the Frank Sinatra sound, you will love this CD.
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|I'm not a huge Star Trek fan. I've seen some of the old episodes when I was a kid, caught a few of the newer series episodes, and have seen some of the movies with Shatner & Nemoy. I've liked them all, but always been a strong Star Wars fan. I heard about a new Star Trek movie coming out months ago, saw some posters, and wasn't that excited. It looked sharp, updated, but thats about it.<br /><br />On a whim I went to see it this past weekend. And I really fell in love with the characters, I cared about the plot, and the effects were beyond amazing! I tried picturing the characters from the old show and compared them to the cast they chose for this one; it's not really fair but anyone watching the movie must have done that at some point. I recognized the dude from [[ASIN:B0024FAD9C Heroes]], and he really looked like [[ASIN:B00281IDGC Spock]]. From what I remember of the series, the newer characters stayed true to who they played. We learned a lot about each characters origin, and it was nice to see how they all came together.<br /><br />I've never been one to bash Star Trek fans, as there seemed to be some underground feud between Star Wars & Star Trek...I just preferred Star Wars. But this movie was amazing, enjoyable, and I think kept true to the original concept way back when. After it ended I'd been hoping for more, and I'm sure they'll add more to this series. As another reviewer said, this is sort of a reboot to the series, pulling in newer fans, and hopefully satisfying those who've loved it from the beginning. I can't say I was one of them, but I might just have to check out the series from the beginning.
0743454537|4.0|Jodi is an incredible writer but she drives me insane with her tragic endings!!  I can't give her anything less than 4 stars because of her tremendous talent but I'm a heaping mess when I've finished her books, an emotional wreck!!  So that doesn't happen unless she grabs you and takes you into her stories with her and the characters that you grow to love!<br /><br />Can't wait for the movie this summer!!!
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|I've seen every Star Trek show and movie that has ever been published, (and it's a lot of material) and I thought the new movie was great.     This is a reinvention of the series and it is a masterpiece at doing that. Star Trek always evolved as it went on, if it didn't it would have died after 3 seasons. Peoples morales and sophistication change over 43 years and the new Star trek had to change too. My hat's off to Abrams for an excellent movie. I even took my wife to the movie and she liked it. She's now actually asking to watch some of my Star Trek DVD's and THAT is a miracle!
B000ZM1MG4|5.0|Wonderful little package!<br /><br />When Tootsie came out on dvd (up to that point I had the video, the soundtrack on cassette and possibly the sheet music) I was bitterly disappointed by the lack of extras..<br /><br />Or should I say the extra - a trailer for the film..<br /><br />So I'm pleasantly surprised with the 25th aniversary release of this film (February 2008 released). Ok, the deleted scenes aren't much cop (5 brief scenes - mention of \\"Terry Bishop\\" but not much else - Terry Bishop we learn is Michael's old roommate who took his role on The Iceman Cometh, which is why Michael was so furious and had to see his agent early on in the movie..<br /><br />Ok - well, what can you say? One of the best films ever made? with an unbilled Bill Murray (Jeff) (not listed in the credits! what gives?!) I remember reading in one of Roger Ebert's reviews or something how Bill didn't ask for a credit. He very nearly steals the film!<br /><br />He's kind of a Greek Chorus, commenting on the action here and there, very wittily too I might add: \\"You slut!\\"<br /><br />It probably is the best film he has ever been in. Rushmore is great but the replay factor isn't so great as Tootsie's.<br /><br />What I like most about this package is that theres an hour long Making of Tootsie. This is the best bonus feature on this dvd (the deleted scenes are about 10 minutes, not really watching more than once to be honest; and theres a few minutes of Dustin Hoffman's screen tests as Dorothy Michael, fairly early on?)<br /><br />But quite a lot of interesting stuff gets covered - first, the script.. It went through many different hands, lotta different perspectives. An (uncredited) woman writer fleshed out the female characters (Sandy (Teri Garr), etc))<br /><br />You get Dabney Coleman, Jessica Lange, Dustin Hoffman, Teri Garr talking about the film, and its clear they absolutely love it, thoroughly enjoyed their time acting in it, that it was just a breeze to do so. Hoffman's talking about his alter ego Dorothy, and you can tell hes very close to her, discussing who she was and what made her tick (and how she would have a difficult time finding a love, in his opinion, cos she really wasn't physically attractive, which upset him when talking it over with his wife)<br /><br />WELL worth watching, this making of..<br /><br />Back to Bill Murray - probably his best role. I know its a supporting character, and hes only in it here and there, but hes really quite wonderful. The voice of sanity throughout the film: \\"Do not do this!\\" he tells Michael at one point when hes about to go away with Julie upstate, eating lemons (a detail which makes for a richer film, though of course it makes no sense, and noone knew Bill would be eating them in that shot.. Murray seems to have had the filmmakers in thrall - at one point its mentioned how Murray was pissed off with his room in the apartment in the film and TRASHED IT!<br /><br />The apartment is on 17th street, which is an interesting detail - as this is a New York City film. The Russian Tearoom is where Dorothy accosts his agent of course. You get the action of the film ending on a street with passers by, very rich detail. Very moving stuff. You totally buy into the reality of the film because it looks so real. The apartment kitchen is tiny, hardly a mirror to look at yourself into, wonderful improvised scene with Sandy there..<br /><br />I remember watching this on laserdisc.. I don't still have laserdisc, but I think the picture quality is better than the old video (widescreen of course, with subtitles if you like)<br /><br />The music is lovely (sadly the soundtrack cd is out of print and only available as a Japanese import). And Dabney Coleman plays a jerk so wonderfully! \\"Tootsie take ten!\\"<br /><br />A few bits were late additions to the film, curiously: Jeff's rambling on at the party in the beginning (where hes rambling on about wanting to open a play \\"only when it rains\\"); Michael Dorsey's teaching of actors (actually, he was addressing actual acting students.. this undoubtedly adds to the films reality)<br /><br />The film could've gone wrong so many ways. Dustin could have looked perfectly ridiculous in drag (he does mention Some Like It Hot as reference, another wonderful screwball comedy). But the story if affecting, the support work is wonderful. (Jeff is a GIFT to an actor - rather like Shakespeare's Mercutio)ould've gone wrong so many ways. Dustin could have looked perfectly ridiculous in drag (he does mention Some Like It Hot as reference, another wonderful screwball comedy). But the story if affecting, the support work is wonderful.

B001TH16DI|3.0|Yes, these are remastered in 1080p and not upconverted from an SD source as many pre-release review trolls would have you believe. There is still some debate as to exactly how they were remastered but from what I can gather TWOK got a needed restoration from the camera negative before remastering while the rest were remastered from prints and processed in video. Feel free to correct me as I'm no expert here.    Yes, DNR was applied somewhat too liberally but not to a degree that makes this anything less than a vast improvement over the DVD versions.    So far I've only watched 1, 2, 3 and 6 on my bedrooms 32\\" 1080p LCD sitting approx. 5 feet away using a PS3.    TMP looked very good. The dated sfx are more obvious now than ever due to the improved video quality. There could have been more attention paid to cleaning up dust and dirt in some scenes, especially where the Enterprise first leaves spacedock. One scene in particular looked like a bird crapped on the camera. I also had issues with the audio while listening over my HDTV's built in speakers. Dialog was very quiet while music and sound fx were blasting. I was constantly turning it up and down. This only occurred with TMP and I'm sure will be fine when I give it a listen over my 7.1 HT.    TWOK, as mentioned previously, looked pretty rough toward the beginning but improved as it went along. Those camera negatives must have been seriously neglected.    TSFS looked good throughout as did \\"Undiscovered Country\\".    BD and PQ issues aside I think this set is good especially for @$80.    I've always liked TMP for it's more intelligent avant garde approach in the vein of 2001 rather than try to directly compete with Star Wars. TWOK is and always will be my favorite. The only one I didn't like and in fact hated is ,of course, \\"Final Frontier\\". It's painful to watch and I was left feeling really embarrassed for all involved. They could have left that one out and no one would have made issue of it.    If a directors cutwith full restorations on all the films, is released I'll probably give this as a gift to someone and get it. I may wait for new release pricing to subside though.      LOTR will be getting the same theatrical edition treatment but since there is no debate that the extended versions are the ones to have I urge everyone to avoid that first dip. You can get away with that with Star Trek but not LOTR.
B000T05R90|5.0|The album is superb. No way you can give that less than 5 stars at any given time<br /><br />Why no early Floyd outtakes? Theres \\"only\\" an alternate Matilda Mother (ok, its pretty great!)<br /><br />I understand Scream thy last scream & Vegetable man were kept off this reissue at the last minute (according to an interview with Mason in Oor magazine)<br /><br />So consider this a bit of a lost opportunity. Nice to have the notebook with \\"Syd\\"s doodles and silliness, but would rather have had more altnerate takes! Surely theres more stuff that could've filled up the third disc! \\"John Latham\\"? \\"Early morning Henry\\" (no relation to Keith Moon's \\"Early Morning Cold Taxi\\" one hopes!)<br /><br />And how about the mid 60s recordings of \\"Butterfly\\" and \\"Double O Bo\\". Okay, the latter is probably not so good, but surely there could've been room left for \\"Lucy Leave\\" which is a great track (by Barrett? Dunno! Don't have the acetate!)<br /><br />I see this as a missed opportunity, but then Syd fans are used to that. We had to buy a best of (from an artist who put out 2 albums!) just to have the Bob Dylan Blues<br /><br />Which really should've been on Opel the first time..<br /><br />I still doubt that \\"Living Alone\\" from the Barrett sessions (1969) will ever see the light of day, or \\"Butterfly\\" (one of Syds earliest Syds songs!) but perhaps for the 50th anniversary of Piper!
B000TGCR38|4.0|A fictional war drama based on a true story, this film unfortunately received only limited release in the USA. Full of action and truly entertaining. Carice van Houten plays a beautiful Jewish woman living in German-occupied Holland during late 1944 who enrolls in the Resistance to fight the Nazis who killed her family.
0425129586|5.0|I've read many other Agatha Christie's book and I can safely said that this is the best I've read so far, and I think it would be hard to top this one, It keep you guessing starting from the first murder till the last sentence of the book. Anyboby can be the murder but who?<br /><br />I couldn't stop reading and in fact I finished the last 160 pages within 3 hours because its fascinating. The plot flows really well through out the whole story. Who's mr.Owen? biggest question of all.
0307454541|1.0|Tedious, cliche-ridden and devoid of likable characters, I only finished this one because it's my book club's choice for this month. Contains graphic sex and violence, much of which has nothing to do with the mystery of the story. I saw the end coming from less than two-hundred pages in (though albeit, I thought the killer had a different motive), and I wish I had followed my gut instinct and stopped reading after two graphic rape scenes (warning: devices are used for these) that turned out to have NOTHING TO DO WITH THE STORY!!!<br /><br />The main female character has trouble reacting to situations and interacting with people. She is often described as having a blank expression, and she refuses to talk to psychologists or any authorities. She's a ward of the state and deemed \\"mentally incompetent,\\" yet she functions as this amazing researcher and computer hacker. It's only in the final pages that the main male character hypothesizes that she may have Asberger's Syndrome. Oh, yeah Stieg Larrssen? That might have been a handy piece of solid info earlier on to help us know the girl and be amazed by her talents at a much earlier point in the narrative.<br /><br />And that male character, ech. He's a total mimbo, sleeping with every available lady in the book, none of whom he has any kind of attachment to. The ladies find him irresistible, though I myself imagined him as a kind of heavier, older version of Stellen Skarsgard, who is like, probably Robert Redford in Sweden. Seriously. Even the chicks he doesn't bag look at him sideways like all he has to do is say the word. He is attached to one woman, an old friend who's married, and yet both of them expect their other lovers to just \\"understand\\" their bond. Maybe it's that way in Sweden, but it didn't hold much weight for me.<br /><br />In all the narrative goes off in quite a few directions that are never followed through on, with long portions that really don't tie well enough into the story. Overall, a big waste of my valuable reading time..
B001E2JNA6|5.0|The price was good, the order arrived quickly and the Blu-ray version presents a visual feast. I am a very satisfied customer.    Rayo B Budge
0312330537|5.0|This is the type of book that is difficult to put down. With 933 pages of fine print I usually avoid this type of book because of poor eye sight. I devoured the story with a magnifying glass and it is very well written and easy to follow. The story is quite factual yet written as a novel. While the main character is quite a villain one can't help being on his side all of the way. Wonderful entertainment.
B001K3JF7K|5.0|It is Diana Kroll at her best. It is an echo back to the Sinatra album with Gilberto which was the ultimate all time classic of that genre. Kroll nails it and should get her a Grammy.
B000FZETKC|4.0|A pleasant watching experience through and through. Masterson, Thompson, Stoltz, Koteas, Sheffer, all give strong and enduring performances.<br /><br />A little gem.
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|This new film is perfectly cast, has great special effects and best of all, its full of delightful surprises!!!     Truthfully some of the best Star Trek episodes of the various series has been time travel or parallel Universes.  Enjoy this one for what it is and don't diss it because Grandpa Shatter was not included. Anyone who has rated this movie with 1 or 2 stars really needs to get a life and join the rest of us in the 21st Century.  They lament the fact that this new film does not stick to 40 years of convoluted continuity, etc. etc. etc.  Quit complaining and go back to watching  your cherished old VHS tapes.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|Leonard Cohen was truly blessed with a golden voice, as he whimsically opines in \\"The Tower of Song\\". More importantly, he is one of the most poignant song writers of our age. This is clearly a seminal collection of his work to date. I've been a fan ever since \\"Suzanne\\" took me down to touch her perfect body with my mind. The holy dove moved in me when Cohen found the secret chord that drew the \\"Halleluiah\\" from my lips... in a provocative song that's impossible to resist singing alongside the master. And even though I'm a little on the right and he's a little on the left, one can't help but admire his sentimental journey of \\"Democracy\\"... perhaps the finest protest song ever written. And if you're looking for total expressions of love and emotion, he's not lying when he croons, \\"I'm your man.\\" Cohen's music soothes and excites while his lyrics penetrate and inspire contemplative thought. He is a consummate stylist, who elicits hidden meaning and promotes insight with every well turned phrase. This is a treasure chest of his very best songs showcased in his finest performance, lavishly produced and graciously served up for your total listening pleasure.
B0000AKY7R|5.0|A conciousness expanding album.  Perhaps a little challenging but extremely rewarding.  This remaster is great and allows you to hear a lot you never could have heard on the original album or initial CD issue.  Even if you already have the old album or CD you need this (and at the current budget price you have no excuse not to)!  The vinyl LP I listened to for years always had a fairly muddy sound which I'd assumed was intentional after hearing it more or less unchanged on the original CD release (which I'm now getting rid of though there was a certain charm to the original and I am still remembering the music that way having heard so much less of it for so many years).  This remaster provides a lot more depth and frees many elements that were just totally buried.  Some of the original negative reactions to this music (from those that had them) may have been in part to the mix, which didn't help music that can be overwhelming to start with.  Not to mention the new edition has two bonus tracks that are very different (and fine) takes of the songs involved.    I first heard this many years ago, shortly after being introduced to the Mahavishnu Orchestra.  This has a little more purely jazzy feel (as it is essentially channeling Coltrane, with a tune of his associate Pharoah Sanders also included), though with it all set on a little different angle by Santana's element (who I'd of course heard earlier than any of this, and liked).  Reading the meager credits on the original sent me off to find some Coltrane (the original 1960 Atlantic studio version of My Favorite Things, while miles from this, was a great and fitting - and astoundingly improvisational - start that helped provide some continuity when hearing later takes of that same song through the 1965-ish period at which Coltrane was writing and performing the music this album jumps off from).  That then opened many other musical dimensions.    This album may in many ways be best understood as a \\"tribute\\" album (though it was not labeled as such) - before those things became overused and hackneyed marketing ploys, and shows the potential of what that sort of effort should be.  It takes elements of a musical master and inspiration (Coltrane), brings together many kindred musical spirits who further inspire and push each other - together (there's a lot more going on here than just John and Carlos and they are all playing it together live) - and launches it all in an entirely new direction (essentially improvisation on and extensions of themes and directions suggested by the inspiration - think Miles Davis' \\"Directions in Music\\" applied to a very fertile period of Coltrane's work with radically different instrumentation than Coltrane used).  It has some Coltrane tunes on it, but not like he ever played them (of course no one could play them like he did and that's part of the point being made).  It has many elements of Mahavishnu and Santana in it, but not necessarily like they played anywhere else either (though reflective of where they and the supporting musicians were at that point in their careers, which was a pretty sweet spot).  This was recorded essentially live in the studio (as the alternate takes demonstrate), back when that was the norm rather than the extraordinary exception, and that shows in a good way (and highlights the astonishing level of musicianship, creativity and instantaneous musical communication involved).  To my ear Carlos has never been better (though he was doing some other fine things around this period, and a few others), despite having had a lot better selling albums than this.    This is essential on many levels.  If you've never heard it, try it.  If you don't like it, put it away for a while then listen more openly next time.  You will get it if you give it a chance.
B000002H33|1.0|I was hopeful that this was the real deal after reading about it being a \\"Rare Japanese Pressing\\" of one of my top FIVE favorite albums of all time AND BOY, WAS I MISLED! I compared the audio quality to my domestic copy purchased close to 20 years ago by now and there was ABSOLUTELY NO DIFFERENCE! It also says it was pressed in ARGENTINA, NOT JAPAN right on the cd and the booklet that comes with it looks like a cheap bootleg pressing! TOTALLY AVOID THIS FRAUD AT ALL COSTS! How long is it going to take for Lars and Co. to update this classic album with a 20+ bit remaster so scamsters quit taking advantage of true fans like myself??? Amazon needs to stop this scam right now!
B000YABIQ6|1.0|Four hours of my life I wish I could have back. Great acting, amazing costumes and sets; unfortunately not one remotely interesting thing happened the entire time I watched (well half watched- I kept falling asleep). Imagine transporting yourself back in time to an ad office and spying on the goings on there; thats all there is to this show! When I watch a show I like to be transported to somewhere more interesting, my real life has more going on than this show!
B001EOQWF8|2.0|The movie itself is wonderful. The visual and audio quality is beautiful.    The BluRay \\"features\\" of this apparently mean that it is a BR-Java disc, which means that you can't resume play of the movie at any point like you can with a normal BluRay. Which makes this an extremely frustrating movie to watch if you ever have to stop it.    This is particularly because I was initially having trouble getting surround sound until I put my PS3 in \\"Bitstream\\" audio mode instead of \\"Linear PCM\\" which is the default. I must have watched the opening Disney cruft at least 20x trying to get the audio sorted.    Another very annoying privacy violation by this BR disc: When I allowed it to download updates from the internet (something I normally do not do), it somehow PERMANENTLY set the \\"Allow disc to connect to the internet\\" to Always Allow instead of Always Ask.    To be honest, if I had it to do over again I probably would have just gotten the DVD version.
B0001XAOLQ|5.0|There is barely a line of dialogue, gesture or expression that does not ring true in this brilliant account.  A benchmark production of its genre, particularly when one recalls it did not have the computer-generated imagery available to say Band of Brothers, or the budget of Titanic. Given this, it would be picky to complain that the odd shot of blazing ships looks a little unconvincing.  Fantastic.
B001HN697M|4.0|I found the first Underworld picture to be a boring, derivative slight action picture with mild interest.  The sequel was an improvement due to it upping the excitement factor and unmuddling the storytelling.  Neither films were particularly memorable or original.  I always thought the idea of clashing these two mythic movie monsters was a novel idea.  Underworld was the first major picture in recent years to set it in motion, but was ultimately lackluster.  Unfortunately, the unforseen popularity of this series will prevent the story of Vampires vs. Werewolves from gracing the screen for a long while.<br /><br />Now we come to the third Underworld sequel, a prequel, and we get what I've always longed for, a full on werewolf and vampire war by the hundreds.  We get gothic castles, swords and horses and leave out the pleather-clad super heroes that owed more to The Matrix then the concept would initially conclude.  Is this film great or wonderful?  No, not really.  It's by-the-numbers in it's origin tale and delivers the action the trailers and promotions promised.<br /><br />One thing this prequel gets right that the previous films couldn't is the romance factor.  I really believed the two star crossed lovers in this film, unlike Beckinsale and Speedman's in the previous films which just seemed labored, and the two stars had no chemistry together.  You wanted less love and more action.  This film makes the relationship real and grand, and makes it worthy of a full-on war, as opposed to the film Troy which never really made you believe any war would be started over Helena.  The scene where the lovers are ultimately and permanately parted is truly well done and dramatic.  Good job.<br /><br />The special effects, the real reason for these films to exist, are not up to par though.  There are some scenes and shots of fast moving hords of werewolves that just don't work.  They look animated and unrelated to the natural space they occupy.  Some of the slower motion CGI werewolves look convincing enough.  The practical on-set werewolves, like the previous films, are awesome and truly work.  No surprise there, the director of this sequel is Patrick Totopoulis, the prouduction and creature designer of the previous films(and many others including The Cave, Stargate, Independence Day, and Dark City).  He does a good job of directing here with what appears to be a much smaller budget than the last sequel's.<br /><br />We get more traditional, and  ultimately appropriate gothic imagery and costumes that are really fun and effective.  The pallette, like the previous films, is monotone and chrome-blue.  The photography is dark, and since the film isn't going for scares, not too dark to muddle the images of action.  The action sequences themselves aren't that innovative.  They're the typical hack and slash and arrow penatrations we're used to seeing in these type of films, but I welcome them over the laborious task of sitting through one more bullet timed, slow-motion gun battle that instantly makes me want to go to sleep.<br /><br />So, I give this film the highest rating of the Underworld series.  A series of films that isn't that good to begin with, and has somehow wormed it's way into the hearts of every 13 year old in America.  The story is clean and to the point.  The action is fun.  Most the special effects work.  The acting is all on spot.  Surprisingly, Rhona Mitra(Sonya) is very good in this film.  This actress started her career as the body model for the video game Tomb Raider and Kevin Bacon's rape victim in The Hollow Man, but she never really showed any real acting chops(including her lead role in last year's derivative Doomsday).  In this film she is quite good and hits the mark.  Bill Nighy is wonderfully evil and cold in this film.  Thankfully, he learned from his performance in the original Underworld to rope it in.  He was terrible in the first film, but is great in this one.  Go figure.<br /><br />A definate rental.enough.  The practical on-set werewolves, like the previous films, are awesome and truly work.

B001PPLJIQ|5.0|The controversy surrounding this story is overwehlming. It makes you think \\"What would I have done?\\" Not only concerning the war crime but the love relationship. The impact war had on the home nation and the impact love had on a young boy is weaved throughout the story. This story gives a point of view from the other side. This movie is well done and I applaud Kate Winslet on a brillant acting job.
0920668364|5.0|I first purchased this book when I taught Kindergarten about 16 years ago. I cried while reading it during story time, and I have cried each and every time I have read it since.  I just love the story. I gave my son a copy of this book for his 21st birthday. It saddens me some of the mean spirited comments I have read about this book on Amazon. I don't think there was anything wrong with the mother in the story. I hope when my life is at an end, that my son will still love me enough to take me in his arms and sing to me. Buy this book, it's Beautiful!

My intention for this product was simple yet unorthodox: I wanted to use it for recording a drum set. I wanted to do it through my M-Audio ProFire 610. I had 4 mics, 4 stands and a 5 piece drum set. I love my ProFire610 it is reliable and the preamp is clean and strong. I have no gripe with it it's just that the preamp only works on two of the 6 inputs, so I figure if I get a mixer I can use ITS preamped channels and run them through the 1/4\\" inputs on my interface. Well, it worked. It worked GREAT. Not only did it sound great but I was able to have more control over the sound of each individual mic. Low noise, great sound and I still had 4 1/4\\" inputs on my mixer to play around with.  With my drum set experiment over I now had an 8 input mixer at my disposal. Add two monitors and you've got yourself a nice little PA. There are no BUS outputs so if you're serious about getting a descent mixer I wouldn't bother, but as a starter mixer for the price offered, I couldn't be happier. It works fantastic for small gigs or (God forbid) house parties.   It may not be the prettiest looking mixer but its a very simple, self explanatory and effective mixer. I didn't need all the flash and the input/output jacks on the top is WAY better than running them out the back of the unit (I hate that!). The EQ setup for each channel is basic: Hi, Mid, Low, FX , Pan and Level. Having an FX send is awesome when using it live. I didn't think a tiny little mixer like this would accommodate that. (the thing is only 9\\"x7\\") It's also got a control room output with volume which you can use for more monitors if need be ;) The Xenyx 802 is a great buy. Had I known I would like it this much I would have paid the extra $[...] and gotten the 12 channel one.
0765318741|5.0|The premise of this story is very simple. A man named Robert Neville is the last man alive on Earth. Everyone else have become vampires and this story is about Robert's life being alone in a world full of hideous beings. It is a very simple and basic premise and yet Richard Matheson has taken it and spun a really deep and complex tale out of it.<br /><br />All throughout the book, there are instances where we truly feel for Robert, the pain and frustration he goes through on a daily basis. He struggles with the isolation of being alone, the defeat of not able to find a cure for vampirism, the mysteries surrounding vampirism, and ultimately the seeming 'betrayal' of a woman named Ruth, the only living being he knows after the plaque. Mr. Matheson describes all of this in beautiful, beautiful prose. Not only that, he also has a knack for creating believable characters; all of these characters, even his animal ones, behave the way they should, and it is a delight to read about them.<br /><br />There were some highly technical parts of the book which I felt dragged the pace down, but not too badly as to make the book feel too long-winded. For the most part, the story chugs along nicely.<br /><br />One more thing I've noticed about I AM LEGEND was that it felt very allegorical of the problems we have in our world today. Man is a very territorial and violent species and we see that even in a post-apocalytic context, wars and conflicts of interest can still happen, and will happen.<br /><br />I am Legend is truly a triumph of story telling, Mr. Matheson was clearly at the top of his game when he wrote it.
B000U0F7RG|3.0|I love the Gilmore Girls, and if we hadn't had such a bad experience with this product I would definitely recommend it.  The first one we got had a small error, the cover of the episode guide was torn off (this was bought new on Amazon).  Unfortunately we couldn't just get a new episode guide from Amazon or the Manufacturer, so we exchanged the whole thing for a new one.  That had an even bigger error.  One of the disks was blank, and several of the disks were scratched.  We returned it for a refund, and we have decided to get the Gilmore Girl's seasons in a different way.      Even though \\"they\\" say, \\"The third time's the charm,\\" we were tired of dealing with the problems and opted not to give this manufacturer another chance.
0756405890|5.0|First person narratives can be a mixed bag. I feel the success of such a narrative is dependent on two things: the talent of the author and the appeal of the protagonist or central character. I have great respect for authors who can draw several characters and interact with an ensemble effectively. Stephen King, George R.R. Martin and Tom Clancy are especially good at this. I prefer a well told third person perspective but I must say that I was impressed by the first person p.o.v. in this novel. Kvothe's voice is always steady and has a strong mix of sarcasm, virtue, and historical wherewithal. For this reason it is a successful 1st person narrative. Rothfuss also has a poet's way with words that often lends itself to commentaries that reach beyond the text itself...    ...An example of the author's strong prose can be found on p.135 of the paperback version (ch.18) in which he briefly describes the four doors of the mind that cope with pain. \\"...Second is the door of forgetting. Some wounds are too deep to heal, or too deep to heal quickly. In addition, many memories are simply painful, and there is no healing to be done. The saying \\"time heals all wounds\\" is false. Time heals most wounds. The rest are hidden behind this door.\\" There are a lot of good commentaries about life like this that are intertwined with Kvothe's own tribulations that add richness to his character. The story quickly becomes one of experience that alters Kvothe's outlook on life and how he copes with disappointment, death, moderate success and yearning.     It's hard for me to center on anything in this book that gave me trouble. I found the world building to be solid and interesting. The story about Lanre and the myth of the chandrian adds depth to the tale and is always lingering in the background. I wish it didn't linger so much, I found myself wanting more info about the chandrian but this is a tiny complaint. The Waystone Inn, Tarbean, and the University are given excellent description which is where the majority of the chronicle takes place.     I felt invested and involved in all of Kvothe's struggles. The author does a good job of juggling Kvothe's many responsibilities and still ensuring that none of them feel stale or inconsequential. This is the toughest part of the 1st person narrative because when you are telling a story through one set of eyes you are probably going to have that one character doing several things. This is the case in NOTW but it is balanced well.    The magic system is partially borrowed from Ursula Leguin's `Earthsea' tale in which all things have an original name and if known can be manipulated or otherwise controlled. But the \\"sympathy\\" aspect of magic is original and very accessible for the reader. Though not as sexy as the unlimited magic wielded by characters like Gandalf from LOTR, the magic Rothfuss has devised has a kind creativity that I think readers can respect. But the magic is just the icing on the NOTW cake.        While I'm disappointed that DAW and the author made some ill advised promises about the release dates of the trilogy and then pulled them back, I am ever hopeful because the first addition to the series was an incredibly strong showing.
B001TH16DI|4.0|I've now watched all six films in this set. Overall, I think the picture quality is very good - sharp and cleaned up - and so much better than the DVD versions of the movies.  I also had owned the first seven ST films on DVD, so I have an idea what those versions look like. The Wrath of Khan was restored in Hi-Def; the other films were remastered in Hi-Def.  Audio mixes of all the films are in 7.1 Dolby TrueHD.<br /><br />I have not watched the DVD and blu ray versions at the same time; that would require a second DVD/Blu ray player hooked up to my system.  I have re-watched the first 30 minutes of ST TMP on DVD and then immediately watched it on blu ray from this box set. I watch these films on a (self calibrated) Sony 40XBR4 using previous gen HDMI Monster cables and last year's Sony BDP-s350 with firmware version 19. I have a 5.1 audio system (Def Tech 800's) powered by a Yamaha RXV-663. I am not an expert in picture quality/audio evaluations.<br /><br />ST TMP:  The film looks very good.  I recall maybe 3 scenes where dirt or film blemishes appear in TMP.  The picture colors are brighter and more natural looking compared to what I recall from the DVD. In one scene, when the Enterprise is departing space dock, the film dirt is so obvious that one wonders how that was missed during cleanup. Yes, the film looks much cleaner compared to the DVD version.<br /><br />In several scenes of ST TMP, I noticed the complexions of facial skin are smooth and somewhat wax-like. The PQ looks much sharper than the DVD version. After my second viewing of select scenes of TMP on blu ray and comparing them to scenes on the DVD version, I don't see a real difference of DNR levels between these versions. Perhaps someone with a large screen (wider than 65\\") should compare the two and comment on the level of details.<br /><br />There are a few scenes in TMP where one part of it is sharp and in focus (e.g. Cmd. Decker, who is standing next to Capt. Kirk) while in that same scene, another part is totally out of focus (e.g. the shoulder or arm of Capt. Kirk who is standing next to Cmd. Decker; or, the background of the Bridge, etc.). In other instances, the right/left sides of the scenes look blurry to me. I listened to the commentary track on TMP and learned that the out-of-focus scenes are the results of bi-focal lenses used on the cameras.<br /><br />ST II: I agree with The Digital Bits concerning ST II.  The PQ and colors are excellent.  In a very early scene, I noticed some film grain and lesser details, but the rest of the film looks fantastic.<br /><br />ST III: I have watched ST III and it looks almost as good as Wrath of Khan in many scenes. PQ is clear, sharp; color and contrast are very good indeed. Contrasts in these films look different from that in the DVD versions. I don't know if the contrast levels were \\"corrected\\" to a reference level for HD.<br /><br />ST V and VI: There are scenes in ST V and ST VI where I do not see excessive DNR at all; in fact, the details on the faces of the characters are sharp and in focus. I find these two movies entertaining, especially in scenes with the central characters.<br /><br />ST IV: For some reason, this film didn't look quite as sharp, but perhaps the source material is the reason. Like TMP, ST IV has scenes where the right/left sides of the widescreen look out of focus, caused by the camera lenses used. Overall, I am very satisfied with what I have seen and heard in this remastered HD version of ST IV.<br /><br />The 7.1 Dolby TrueHD audio track sounds fantastic.  For the first time, the dialogue is clear and at a reasonable volume level. When a spacecraft flies by, you can hear it swoosh by you.  The audio mix makes me believe I'm sitting in the Captain's chair! Audio in these films is the best yet available.<br /><br />Because of my TV size, DNR effect is not very noticeable and not a show stopper for me.  Even if DNR was NOT applied to these films, wouldn't you agree that images lose detailswhen projected onto (or viewed on) a larger screen compared to a smaller one? What about viewing distance? Have you ever sat at the front and back rows of a theater and notice a decrease of details when viewing the film up close?<br /><br />Is this box set worth the price? Yes! If you can get a decent discount, that would be even better. At the current price on Amazon, however, you should still consider this set, it's that good. If your viewing screen size is greater than 46\\", and you are concerned about excessive DNR, then perhaps you should wait (or rent whenever that becomes available). If you have a very nice HD video processor that cleans up/fixes PQ anomalies on your DVD set, then maybe you should stick with your DVDs and wait until the next blu ray release of Star Trek. Let those who demand (and are willing to pay for) PQ perfection wait until another set is released.  Despite some of the DNR and PQ blemish issues, I still highly recommend this box set.<br /><br />I give 5 plus stars for the many years of fun, inspiring, imaginative entertainment that Star Trek films have provided for me. I love the original TV series and the films with the original casts. I give 4 stars to this box set because it is not the definitive set that Paramount could have (should have?) produced. I think this is the first time in 25 years that I've had the opportunity to re-watch the theatrical versions of ST I TMP, ST II, and ST III. Each blu ray film has 1 or 2 commentaries, 3 or 4 all-new short featurettes in HD, Library Computer, several previously released content in SD, and BD-Live Star Trek IQ.  The bonus disc is a special treat; you will not be disappointed with that content. (Note: The feature about James Doohan is actually in SD, but the written description on the disc indicates HD)<br /><br />Lastly, go watch the new Star Trek film.  As an old Trek fan since the 1970's, I think the new Trek movie is an excellent, entertaining experience - a blast from the past and future!e? What about viewing distance?

B000BNX3B4|4.0|This is a light, romantic comedy along the lines of \\"Sleepless in Seatle\\" or \\"You've Got Mail\\".  Not terribly deep, but an enjoyable way to spend a Saturday evening.  It has been out for awhile but my family just got around to watching it this past weekend and all of us liked it which can be difficult to accomplish sometimes (our ages range from 52 down to 14)!<br /><br />Diane Lane is wonderful and so is John Cusack.  Both are strong actors individually and could carry the movie single-handedly but the two of them in the same movie is great.  The supporting cast was pretty incredible and I partilarly liked Stockard Channing - she manages to convey an incredibly 3-dimensional character without appearing to be working at it.  Outstanding acting on her part.<br /><br />If you enjoy light comedies like those mentioned above, it would be worth your time.<br /><br />Note for parents:  It really is a PG-13 movie in my opinion.  There is a entire scene lasting several minutes that is very funny, but not appropriate for anyone under 13 (and maybe even older).

B001U0HBPQ|3.0|I wouldn't knock anybody out of line to see this movie, but it does have a fascinating quality nonetheless. Benjamin Button is born with what appears to be Progeria. He's an eighty year old toddler. So peculiarly, he begins to grow younger as he grows older. The special effects (seeing Brad Pitt as a fearfully wrinkled child) are impressive.<br /><br />The story (based on an F. Scott Fitzgerald short story) has the quality of a roman fleuve. Benjamin wanders the world as he grows younger and wiser. The love of his life (Cate Blanchett) and he have a passionate but sometimes celibate lifelong love affair, but are ultimately pulled apart as they age in different directions.<br /><br />Pitt's a passable Benjamin, and Blanchett is curiously so-so Englishly flat as Daisy (another F. Scott Daisy!), but the real downside to BENJAMIN BUTTON is its resemblance in the second and third reels to FORREST GUMP. I joked to my companion that \\"Life is like a box of chocolates,\\" and only later found out that the same screenwriter did both scripts. So there.<br /><br />Sadly, the FORREST GUMP-ness of BENJAMIN BUTTON really robs this film of a wonderful chance to be memorable: What happens to you if you grow wiser and more experienced as you grow younger, stronger and more capable? What does a man do with his life when he's born at eighty-five and knows the span of his years? By treading safe ground and eating chocolates, BENJAMIN BUTTON makes of itself an utterly forgettable film.
0307266303|5.0|I am not a runner, but I want to become one now.   I picked this book up not as a fan of ultra distance running- I had always considered ultra distance runners as masochistic freaks driven by the runners high as their body tries to cope with this grueling activity that they were never meant to do.  After reading this book, I still think ultra distance runners are freaks, but not masochistic ones.  They are freaks because they are some of the few who understand that man was designed to run, and run long distances.  The book centers around trying to unearth the secret of the Tarahumara Indians- how are they able to run long distances on insufficient nutrition on bad terrain with little foot protection without injury? While doing this, McDougall winds through the entertaining history of ultra running and its quirky athletes along with scientific evidence for the health benefits of endurance running, and barefoot endurance running in particular.  This book is funny, mesmerizing, thought-provoking, and, if you thought you were not cut for running, may make you give it another go.  Highly recommended.
B001S86J5S|4.0|Major League is one of my all time favorite movies with most of the lines of dialogue committed to memory long ago (after the 40th or 50th viewing...)  From the first time I saw the film I fell in love with the lovable losers that are destined to win one for all of the picked on losers out there.  At the time the film was released the Cleveland Indians had been known as one of the sorriest franchises in all of major league baseball.  Season after season the Indians found ways to miss out on being truly competitive.  As if by magic when the film was released the Indians seemed to turn things around in the seasons that followed finally becoming perennial contenders in the 90's.<br /><br />The film itself is comedic gold. Full of cliches and silly jock humor, but also full of touching events that let the viewer care about the athletes they are watching on the screen.  We pull for the players and want to see them do well because the film allows us to sympathize with these losers and hope they can become winners.<br /><br />Paramount released the Wild Thing Edition of this film to DVD a few years ago.  I grabbed that copy when it was available since it promised the alternate ending that most of us never knew about.  Having watched that ending you realize that without redoing a lot of the later half of the film that the film just wouldn't work with that ending and that what we got in the theatrical release was absolutely the way to go.  That same alternate ending and the rest of the extras that were included on the DVD have been included on the Blu-ray edition of the film, though those extras remain in standard definition, matted (black bars around all edges).  It would have been nice to see the extras upgraded to high defintion for the Blu-ray release, but in reality the important thing here is the film and it looks pretty darned nice.  Not perfect, but very nice.<br /><br />The audio in the Blu-ray is fine though some would complain that it hasn't been upgraded beyond Dolby 5.1.  Considering what the film had when it was released, I'm happy to have a sound track that holds to the original.  As long as the dialogue comes through clearly as I'm quoting it back to the screen, I'm plenty happy with what I got. ;-)<br /><br />Recommended for baseball fans and lovers of comedy.  Well worth the purchase for me, now having double dipped to own a copy on both Blu-ray and DVD.

B001TH16DI|2.0|Now that I have finally gotten to see the box set for myself, I can contribute to this discussion honestly. I am sad to say that the reports about excessive digital noise reduction are absolutely true. I watched The Motion Picture, Wrath of Khan and sampled the others.     I am very glad to have the original version of The Motion Picture finally, with the original soundtrack. Contrast is generally very good. The colors look vibrant and the picture is clean.  But, it is TOO clean. The picture is heavily scrubbed with digital noise reduction to remove film grain. The problem is that it also removes picture detail and the look and feel of film, which is the whole point of high definition. A film should look like film, not like video. The noise reduction is applied so heavily that clarity changes from shot to shot, depending on how much grain was there. Some shots look almost out of focus. Effects shots with heavy grain become smeared because the processing is so overdone. Faces lose their fine detail and look waxy and unnatural.     I am just shocked that Paramount could be so stupid regarding these films. They know (or should know) that these are highly anticipated by a very discerning fan base. These should be reference quality discs, but they are not. This kind of DNR processing can be done for VHS and maybe DVD, but NOT a high def release. You can't make a film shot on 1980s film stock look like it was shot on 2009 HD video, it doesn't work. Like I said, the colors and contrast look great. A few of the shots in the V'ger interior really pop off the screen. But the image is sterile and has an unnatural quality. In ST III and IV in particular, the actors look like wax mannequins in motion.    The exception is the Wrath of Khan. Although it did not escape the DNR button, it is much lighter. The film has a much more natural and film like appearance. Suprisingly, the color and contrast is not as good, but that is a limitation of the original film stock. Khan is the onlyfilm that underwent a full restoration. But restoration is not the issue here. The film elements used for the other transfers are fine. The transfers themselves are actually very good. It is the heavy digital processing done after the fact that is the problem.    How much you notice depends on the size of your monitor. 50\\" and up and the waxy faces really stand out. To see what I mean, put on TMP and stand close to your monitor and look at the waxy texture of skin in close ups. Then look at the same thing for Khan. The difference is striking.     The bottom line is that the films don't look bad per se, they just don't look like they should. Many people will be unaware of how much the films were manipulated and how much picture has been scrubbed away. The sad fact is the Paramount obviously just doesn't care about these films or their fans. Star Trek has always been just a cash cow for them. Enough people will buy this set (like me) and they will make their money. Then they can release another blu ray set with the Director's versions and another with properly made transfers of these films and on and on. I didn't own films 3-6, so this isn't a complete waste, but I am sure I will end up buying at least TMP again at some point if they ever get it right. Paramount should fix these and offer replacement discs, but they won't.    UPDATE: For people that don't seem to understand this issue, let me try and clarify. I have seen all of the films and all of the movies are in HD, but were digitally altered. The issue is kind of like colorizing classic black and white films. I am not happy they were digitally tampered with when they would have looked great left alone, with full detail and film grain intact (like Khan was for the most part). Blu ray has the capability to present film very accurately, and this was not done for these discs. If you want a balanced review on the set, including accurate discussion of the DNR issue, check out the Digital Bits website.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|This collection is great.  The video is unbelievably clear and sharp for such an old film source.  The audio on these films is recreated wonderfully in surround sound with painstaking detail.  I have always been a fan of The Godfather trilogy and this collection will not dissapoint.  I never did watch or buy this trilogy on DVD so I cannot compare this Bluray version to the DVD version (I only owned and watched this on VHS, I know that is kind of old school).<br /><br />I can't get enough of Bluray and my collection is growing quite nicely.  This restoration is a great addition to my collection and would be a great addition to anyone's collection.

0374139563|5.0|I'll keep it brief... This is an excellent book that takes an alternative look at Aid to Africa! This book does so, without being venomous towards the history of European domination over major African interests, or the history of Middle Eastern conquests throughout Africa as well. This book decides instead to take an UP TO DATE and mature look at what can be done from an economic stand point and a leadership standpoint to allow the African continent to raise its head out fot he dregs of poverty that it has found itself in for a while now!    Is everything in this book feasable? I don't know. Is everything in this book THE answer? I don't know.

B001TH16DI|1.0|Wow, I have never seen so many bad reviews for a new blue ray release.  I really would  like to have this collection on blue ray.  However, I think I'll pass like others here.  There is no sense in getting this if it truly is not HD.  I might as well keep my DVDs and  just download the movies from iTunes.    What a shame.  Any responses from people who picked this up?
0061122416|4.0|This book has a simple message. Seek you personal legend in face of adversities. The message in itself is neither new nor highly motivating, perhaps my opinion derives from already reading several books on topics of success, leadership, motivation, etc. Story wise i found it decent but not very engaging and a bit dull for my taste, just not into the whole omens, shepherd, king, legends type of story. But overall a good book and worth reading.

B001VB8UAE|4.0|Especially interesting is the newer concert where Streisand is very relaxed and all about the music. Unfortunately, her voice has deepened and the wild ride slightly out of control upper register thrills are gone. I think the best moment is just Babs and the piano and 'Nobody's Heart'. She does a good job with 'My Shining Hour' but it's a shame she didn't record it when her voice was at its peak.   On the whole, very enjoyable.

Now it's not perfect, and I'll get to that, but first let me respond to those that hate on the movie becuase it doesn't follow original story lines.  I think this is EXACTLY what the Star Trek universe needed... A new beginning.  This is an alternate timeline (a reboot as you all are aware of now), the original timeline is tired and a bit stale now, it's time for something new.    The graphics are fantastic, this is a must see movie for big screens, the bigger the better.  The effects are top notch, the artistic design is breathtaking, the sense of scale jaw dropping.  I have no complaints here at all, an utterly georgeous film from beginning to end.    The sound is great, just what you could expect from a Trek movie.  Not a whole lot to say here, there is the right amount of emotion conveyed in the musical score and it doesn't take away from the movie at any point, only adds to it.    The choice of actors to portray the younter versions of characters we already know and love was good.  A few forced moments here and there but overall most of them did a good job, the only comlaint being an occasionally overly exagerated moment, and the choice for Chekov was unfortunately distracting, luckily it was a short section of the movie.    Spoilers in this paragraph:  Now there are some issues with the film that need to be overlooked to enjoy it.  I'll start with the story, It's a bit weak, but not much of Star Trek is truly deep story driven, the story is just the mechanism, so this I felt was easy enough to forgive.  On the other hand, the bad guy, while well acted, was not portrayed seriously enough, he was treated in the film as a small menace and yet he was killing millions of people... which brings me to my primary complaint.  Vulcan is destroyed!!  While in itself this is ok for a new direction, the way it was handled (or not handled) was awkward.  A whole planet (and a primary planet of the federation) has been wiped out, and the only person that is affected is Spock, but not because his home planet is wiped out, but because his mom was taken with it...  That's it, no \\"OMG, they took out Vulcan!!\\" in any way shape or form.  It was just treated as some planet, maybe even hardly inhabited as far as the viewer and actors were concerned, but we know that's not true.    That's it, overall I say a great movie that anybody can enjoy as long as you are able to overlook a few things, roll your eyes if you have to a time or two and keep watching.
0345438205|1.0|Not much to say that hasn't already been said. 2001: A Space Odyssey (the film) should have been the beginning and final chapter in this 'saga'. The movie was a classic enigma; the 'Mona Lisa' of cinema. Each viewer left with his own interpretation of \\"what the hell was all that about'? That was the fun, the mystery, the challenge of what the Odyssey presented to the individual viewer. To have it dragged out, ad infinitum, into a Star Wars wannabe, was just sad! 2001 Is still one of my all time favorite films. I was 17 when I saw it in CINERAMA in Montreal. I'm 60 now, and have watched the movie maybe 50 times. It still leaves me with the same chills and awe that it did the first time I saw it. Too bad it got dragged the the comercialism knot-hole! Kubrick must be rolling in his grave.
B0000AXE8I|2.0|The first matrix was brilliant.  Like most sequels this one falls far short.  There is no more storytelling; just a rehash and fight scenes.
141690977X|5.0|I LOVED this book.<br />Ok, wait. At times I did NOT love this book--it could be kind of harsh at times, and as the girl in the movie adaptation says, \\"But if I stop dating all the guys that aren't really into me there won't be any left!\\"<br /><br />I did see a couple of reviews from guys on this book who claimed Greg's reasons were bullcrap. No, they are not. They may not apply to EVERYONE, specifically shy people, but they certainly do apply to most people. I know this, because if you're a guy reading this book, you'll probably find if you replace \\"him\\" with \\"her\\" the same rules apply. I found multiple examples in this book of things I had done myself to guys I just wasn't that into.<br /><br />Also, there is an exception rule. No rule applies to EVERYONE, so sure there are exceptions.<br />This book was not written for exceptions, it was written for the other...89% of the dating population?<br /><br />And it's right on.<br /><br />If you EVER find yourself sitting by the phone when a guy won't call you back, read this book.<br />If you ever intend on going on another date in your lifetime, read this book.<br />If you ever want to laugh your butt off one evening while at the same time learning a few lessons about life and love, read this book.
B000V8I2QU|4.0|I am not a Bruce Springsteen fan.  There are a few classics of his that I am ok with (Dancing in the Dark was probably my favorite up till now), but  there are quite a few more that I really can't stand listening to.  With that said, this is the first Springsteen cd that I have ever felt compelled to buy because of these three songs: Radio Nowhere, You'll Be Coming Down & Girls In Their Summer Clothes.  I absolutely LOVE them probably because they DON'T sound like typical Springsteen songs, and they sound better every time I listen.  I end up skipping over the ones that do sound like his typical stuff.  I think he was going for the Ronnie Specter 'Wall of Sound' effect on some of these, which may be what everyone is whining about - sound quality wise.  I am still shocked by all the complaints because I really think it sounds fantastic, and I am a very critical 'quality of sound' kind of listener.    Bottom line: for those who don't care what Springsteen is SUPPOSED to sound like, and want to hear some gutsy, bedrock, heart-felt American hometown Rock, check it out.  At least listen to Radio Nowhere - if that doesn't pull you in, move on.
B00068TJM6|5.0|I have to say... I'm a pilot and I have many nice watches. But this one is still one of my favourites! And for a price that makes you almost feel like somebody is trying to sell you a knock-off. I also got a lot of nice comments from friends that wouldn't believe what price range we are talking about (was on sale for 230$).
0767817478|3.0|I'm sorry that all the people who love the Japanese Godzilla should dislike this movie so much. It's a good, fast-paced monster flick; nothing particularly original, but it moves right along and has great special effects. It's nothing like the Japanese Godzilla and I have a suspicion that if the producers had called it something else the reviews would have been a lot more positive. Once you treat it as just a sci fi action pic, it works quite well.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love how this tape has 3 levels allowing you to work into the real killer workout!  And the 20 minute workouts are perfect for me to squeeze into my day.
B001PL4HZW|5.0|I love this soundtrack!  The songs fit so well with the movie.  I've probably played this CD 20 times since I bought it.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|As a lifelong fan of the Star Trek franchise I went into this movie giddy, anxious, and albeit a bit apprehensive (I remember Jar Jar). Regardless, I saw this opening night and on the IMAX. Well, I WASN'T DISAPPOINTED!     I loved TOS as well as Capt Pickard of TNG and Enterprise was \\"okay.\\" As for the new Trek...well, J. J. Abrams has managed to breathe some new life into this classic sci-fi franchise by bringing in a fresh new look and a GREAT CAST!     Chris Pine - James T. Kirk (completely embraced the confidence of Kirk without all the overacting)   Zachary Quinto - Spock (Sylar Rules!)   Karl Urban - Dr. Leonard 'Bones' McCoy (my favorite of all castings!)   Zoe Saldana - Nyota Uhura (she finally has a purpose!)   Simon Pegg - Scotty (Shaun of the Dead--hilarious!)   John Cho - Hikaru Sulu   Anton Yelchin - Pavel Chekov (wasn't completely sold, but I'm hopeful)     **MINOR SPOILERS**   From the opening scenes right down to the final curtain call I thoroughly enjoyed this film! There was a great back story of Kirk's rebellious youth and Spock's childhood conflict within Vulcan society as a half-human half-Vulcan. I even enjoyed the writers take on how McCoy got the name Bones; \\"my ex-wife took the whole damn planet! She left me with nothing except my Bones! I had nowhere else to go!       A great movie (can't wait to see it again) and I'm definitely looking forward to the next several in this series with this terrific cast.  J.J. Abrams definitely created something unique that would please both fans of the cannon releases and new comers (like my wife).
B000SFJWLU|5.0|I first heard of Five Finger Death Punch when they released their mini-album \\"Preemptive Strike\\" Normally, metal isn't my thing, but when I heard \\"The Bleeding\\" for the first time my jaw hit the floor. The singer's voice can only be described as beautiful, and the instrumentalists don't even get me started.
B0009MDPYW|4.0|What a good movie. However as good as it is ,it sometimes takes on a child-like sense of humor.... The acting is ok. But i wish they had a stronger story line...The guy who plays satan is great. And Many of the parts are jaw dropping..... I give it 4 out of 5 stars,,,,I do say buy it because when you see it you will want to see it again......
B000F9RB9Y|2.0|I don't know why MGM can't do a decent video transfer of this movie.  The disc is not worthy of the blu-ray format and is certainly not worth buying if you already own the DVD.
6305090564|5.0|This is a good movie.... I love the action and horror combo. There is some humor in the film which i thinks helps. I say buy it . My five stars means it good. and is on my top ten list of favorite films...
B000055XMF|5.0|Quadraphenia is the greatest rock movie ever made.  The movie's music is timeless. Very much ahead of its time.
B0012NOKKA|4.0|It is my humble privlige to be the virgin reviewer of this.<br /><br />East of Eden were a late 1960's-70s hard rock, prog band, and they had a violin. The violin was not a big feature in this band, mainly working as part of the rythm section.<br /><br />What stands out here are the giutars and flutes and saxes. You could compare this, vaugly, to Court Of  The King Crimson King, in that there is hard rock, and some jazzy, orchestrated ballads.<br /><br />But East Of Eden play their hand a lot broader on this album than King Crimson did on their debut. The guitars are crunchier, and the hard rock has more of a blues base. (If Cream had pushed into the prog era, they might have tried stuff like this.) They also highlight the jazz elements more than Crimso did--where they synthasized a lot of the styles they used, East Of Eden tended to tackle one, or superimpose two, at a time.<br /><br />If you like psych or prog you gotta have this. This band should have been a lot bigger. Maybe they didn't sell because the title sounds more like a docteral thesis than a rock record. Pity.<br /> ,
B001TIQT98|5.0|If you consider sound quality and orchestral execution to be important factors, I still feel that the Gary Bertini complete Mahler cycle on EMI is the best overall one (and it includes a terrific \\"das Lied von der Erde\\"). But there's also no argument that Bernstein's first Columbia Mahler cycle still remains an important milestone in the history of recorded classical music. The real question is this: are these DSD remasterings enough of an improvement to warrant dumping whichever earlier version is already in your collection, and making the upgrade to this even newer one. I would say that the answer lies upon just how satisfied, or unsatisfied you are with Sony's earlier efforts. As usual with a project as monumental as this, you take the bad with the good.    The good part is this: the dynamic range is a bigger now, and there's more \\"air\\" or space around the instruments themselves. But these new remasterings are also a tad \\"brighter\\" sounding; favoring the treble end of the audio spectrum. This is especially true in comparison to the Bernstein Century remasterings, which are generally more \\"smooth\\" sounding. For me, the biggest improvement comes with Bernstein's monumental LSO M8 - a recording that has been slighted-over for the last several decades for the more \\"slick\\" sounding Solti M8. I greatly prefer the Bernstein. This time, there's much less of the distortion that has always dogged the endings to both parts. But it's also really annoying that Sony has now elected to forgo giving us extra tracks in Part II of M8. They also chose to drop the Janet Baker/Israel Phil. \\"Kindertotenlieder\\" that began disc one on the Bernstein Century rendition of this. Instead, Sony has now placed the entire M8 on one disc, sans extra tracks. However, they could have placed the \\"KTL\\" before the first movement of M3, which occupies a single disc by itself. If it's already available, why not use it again?    Now that that's out of the way, another \\"good\\" feature is the inclusion ofthe personal recollections of Mahler that were a major selling point for the New York Phil's own Mahler symphony cycle box set (remember that?). Now I no longer have to feel guilty for no longer owning that particular box (I copied some of the better performances). Every good Mahlerian should own these recollections, I suppose. Another \\"goodie\\" is the inclusion of the Christa Ludwig/Israel Phil. \\"Das Lied von der Erde\\", which has never enjoyed a good mastering job previously. It sounds pretty good here. However, I am bummed that Bernstein's outstanding \\"Des Knaben Wunderhorn\\" has not been included in any of the big box sets. It's a wonderful \\"DKW\\", with both Christa Ludwig and Walter Berry in excellent voice. It should get included.    In summary, if you're a big fan of Bernstein's pioneering Mahler from the 1960s, you'll want to own these DSM remasterings. Just beware that the more realistic and accurate sound also means that momentary lapses in precision and intonation (tuning) are more noticeable now too. If that idea scares you, you might want to stick to the darker sounding Bernstein Century ones. But if you're also a big admirer of Bernstein's ultra-exciting Mahler 8 from London, get this!
0452289963|1.0|Over-hyped, thickly written, some pearls of wisdom but they are well hidden. Tolle could cut content by 50% and made better impact. Not all \\"Oprah's Book Club\\" books are worth it...and this definitely falls into that category.
1416595546|4.0|Montefiore is a very talented nonfiction writer and has been in the forefront of the Stalin years winning several book awards with Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar and Young Stalin.  In Sashenka, the author attempts to weave a story of fiction into the historical backdrop of three different time periods of tremendous change in Russia/Soviet history: 1916, 1935 and 1994.  It might have been too much of a time frame to write about in just 500 pages.  I do think that the story suffered from a lack of depth in the characters and the basic background of Russian history in the time periods for this story.  I did not feel catapulted into the story (such as with The Alienst); and I expected more from this excellent historian.<br /><br />The first part (1916) is a very well thought out storyline that follows the tale of the Zeitlin family.  The father had bourgeois sentiments while the daughter had Bolshevik interests and then disavows her family in pursuit of these Communist tendencies.  This part of the story is well done, even if the writing is only adequate.  Part II is less a storyline but instead sets up the dramatic ending of the book.  Part III is a follow up to uncover the secrets that are not told early in the story and to close the gaps in the plot.  This is an excellent technique and it is used very well by Montefiore.<br /><br />Montefiore might someday become a master story teller.  He has already accomplished that in the world in nonfiction.  However, his ability to find the right word or phrase or rhythm for the reader is just not there.  There is no artistry in the prose.  The writing is flat and lifeless much of the time.  There are moments of truly good writing, but not the consistency that is needed to carry the book to a 5 star rating.  It is difficult to move between writing styles and while this reader was certainly entertained by Montefiore's plot, I was disappointed in the execution.  However, I look forward to his next fiction attempt and I hope that we see it soon.oon.
0307474275|5.0|Normally I am not one to enjoy a mystery story, but The Da Vinci Code changed by mind.  It took me a weekend to read this book and I could not put it down at all during that time.  With each turn of the page, the book becomes more and more addicting.<br /><br />Before I started reading this, my freshman literature teacher gave me a warning.  She said that I should know that not everything written about the Catholic religion is true, but much of the information about the art is true.<br /><br />Dan Brown took what would normally be a clich&eacute;d story of searching for the Holy Grail and spun it to be one that most have never read, much less heard of.  Brown brought a little known version of a story that most have heard time and time again to the masses, creating a cultural phenomena.  He infused well known art and history into his story.<br />For some of the other reviews posted, many gave the book a low rating because of the inaccuracy of some of the information.  But does it really matter if the information is true or not?  In my opinion, it makes the story much more interesting rather than Brown stating facts that are known already.<br /><br />The Da Vinci Code is set to the backdrop of Paris, France.  Brown does a good job of highlighting many of the most famous paintings in the Louvre Museum, including the Mona Lisa and the Madonna on the Rocks.  Brown goes into detail about each painting, especially the Mona Lisa.<br /><br />The two main characters, Robert Langdon and Sophie Nevue play well off each other at times.  Though the dialog can become a bit tiresome and repetitive.  Langdon does a great job of explaining the many aspects of the Grail world.  The one thing that I had a problem with was trying to keep each story and term straight and how it related to the Grail.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed reading the book.  Parts of the story were rather wordy but not to the point where it became unreadable.  The one thing that each reader should know before starting this book that not everything stated is real and it's a fiction book.  Just read it, don't live it.tated is real and it's a fiction book.  Just read it, don't live it.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|This movie is wonderful... Glen Hansard rips your heart out right from the start with his incredibly passionate music. I recommend it to anyone who loves music, movies, love stories and tragedy!
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|Saw the movie in the IMAX Cinema Greenwich last night .     Awestruck - not felt as transfixed since thos eglorious days of 1977 and 1981 and Mr Speilberg best .     faultless production , incredible special effects but not enough to take-over the character driven plot . I am an ORIGINAL Trekkie and hated the Next Gen . Never couuld identify with Picard & Data etc.    This is rip -roaring stuff - Kirk , Spock & Bones nailed . Bones was top top drawer . From a BRIT point of view nice to see Simon Pegg taking the p*ss as usual . Hilarious .    Go see it now . Then go see it again .
B0017SWPXY|4.0|I tell all of my friends they need to read this book. It is unique in the fact that it is the autobiography of a racecar driver's life told from the view of his dog,Enzo.  Denny has a little girl named Zoe ,and a very sick wife who eventually dies of cancer and in laws who hate him. They want Denny to fail,because they are idiots and never saw what their daughter Eve saw in him.They will do anything to ruin his career.  Enzo watches all of this and gives his 2 cents about well everything, and wishes he could talk and be human because he feels helpless as a dog.  He doesn't realize by being this guys pet, he touches so many people.

B001FB4W0W|1.0|So I am disappointed....why may you ask? Well I love Harris's characters in her Sookie Stackhouse series and this just isn't it. Alan Ball and his screen writers have changed all the character events and their respective images. Most and almost all of the event in the TV series don't even happen in the books. I sat there and while watching this tv series saying things like \\"that's not what happened...Tara isn't like that in the book..Sam and Tara nope never happened...who the hell is that..?\\" It's like they stole the basic plot line (very basic) and the characters names and decided to throw out Harris's story. NOT HAPPY! The story was soo good the way it was. As a fan of the books...the TV series has not matched up at all to the books and the books are WAY BETTER than the series... On another note Paquin doesn't get Sookie right, but that might not be all her fault since the writers have flipped the story upside down.

0810970686|4.0|This is the third book in the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series.  It is done in the style of a 12 year old boy's diary.  Greg Heffley, the boy in question, is wimp and a lot of the humor comes from his dad's efforts to make him more \\"manly\\".  Greg describes himself as \\"pretty much one of the best people I know\\", but in reality he is a self-centered underachiever.  This book is quite funny, for kids and adults alike.
159562015X|2.0|There is much to be explored, yet the journey leads to a let down if you are like me and have participated in tests like this. I would suggest this as a fast way to get a snapshot of your strengths, if you have not been tested before.  The online test is quite a disappointment . . . and they want to charge you a lot to get the complete results . . . Not exactly a great feature after paying for the book.
B001E7OO2I|2.0|Ok, there's always room for experimentation in music.  There's always room for true artists to take off in one direction for a few albums then do a 180 and go off on other flights of fancy.  A good example would be one of my favorites, Me'Shell Ndegeocello.  Once you got past Bitter, none of her albums remotely resembled the next.  And that's a good thing.    But with John and Evolver, the progression into 'new' territory simply lacks authenticity and sincerity.  There are a lot of tracks, but very little in terms of content.  There's something about some girl, something about you and I, and something just like everything else on the radio.    I have a few artists that I'll buy their albums even without pre-screening.  Before this album, he was one of them.
B00005JMK0|5.0|It's pure 80s, yet there is a sweetness to this movie that never grows old. Besides the wonderful love story, we get to see the dawn of the computer age while it was happening. The wonder of setting up one's first computer...! Oh, those were indeed the days! Lenny Von Dolen and Virginia Madsen were perfect, and it's easy to see how Madsen has become a major actor since then. (I know that Von Dolen is still working, but I wish his talents had been more widely appreciated over the years, the way that Madsen's have. But I digress...) It's a fun, quirky, romantic, sweet, rich, multi-layered-but-simple little film that has stands the test of time in every way. Oh - and it has no foul language, nudity, or anything objectionable for anyone above the age of.....9? 10? Whoever is in charge of these decisions - please release this on DVD!!!!
0783229526|5.0|This movie is one of the few that was based on a book that is truly done correctly. The effects are great. The story never deviates from the book. The movie did not leave anything important out nor did it add things that were not originally in the book. And you gotta love Hunter S. Thompson, because this book is a memoir / non-fiction. He was / is crazy-cool!

0307454894|3.0|Something odd about this novel - I felt an uneasy  distance between the narrating character and the events he narrates despite the fact that he is, theoretically, intimately involved in these events.  The title confused me. A title generally points to the main character or the most significant theme. However,  the ambiguity of this title and its referent is complicated by the fact that I'm not sure who is the main character:  the narrator or the woman he writes about.    The events span the time from adolescence to middle age of the narrator yet his voice and perspective  remain the same. Maybe he is just not very bright and lacks the ability to look back on his younger self. Or maybe it is to do with the translation.    And I had problems with the treatment of time. I had to flick back to work out when events happened in relation to each other.
B001EYU1VO|2.0|No matter what you've read, this stick is NOT programmable out of the box.  You have to download beta software from Saitek (IF you can find it... I had to get a tech to get me a valid link).  Comfort is only 'ok', maybe because it tries to fit everyone.  Quality is questionable.  I bought this stick based on the Amazon reviews (reviews anywhere else are lacking, I guess that should have been a red flag).  After getting it, I couldn't believe how high the ratings are.  It seems flimsy & cheaply made.  I since found a Youtube video that really pans this stick (just do a search at youtube).  The buttons seem flimsy.  I also saw this stick at a local Fry's and the same button that broke off in the youtube video was broken there as well.  Button positioning is 'ok' but could be better.  I really wanted to like this stick, but with all these issues it's going back to Amazon.

B000JIHP88|2.0|I received this product today.  It was a bit tedious to assemble (took me about 20 minutes) and is too heavy for the location I had originally hoped to put it in.  I was unable to attach it to the back rail on my crib and had to instead put it on a lower side rail, which is fine until my infant gets to be a little more mobile, and then I will either have to lower the mattress to keep it out of his reach or remove it.    I would have packed it up and returned it all together, but when I put the baby in the crib to \\"show it to him\\", he cooed, watched the animals, and fell right asleep.  Since it was such a pain to put together I will probably keep it and just sell it when he gets too big for it to work.

0061703087|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this novel.  As in his usual style, Crichton blends technology with a sci-fi thriller.  In Prey, the subject is nanotechnology.       Jack Forman is the protagonist who used to program computers to problem solve by mimicking nature at its most efficient (e.g. swarming bees).      Jack has been called in to help out his wife (who works at a research lab) on a top-secret project.  He discovers the lab has created self-replicating nanotechnology.  The swarm of microscopic machines have escaped the lab and now seem intent on killing everyone they encounter.
B001PJRAUS|4.0|After a somewhat tedious start, one slowly is able to enter into the conceit of time periods being inter-changeable. Once that has occurred, the story takes off delightfully to an unexpected but acceptable conclusion. Definitely for Jane Austin aficionados and for those who enjoyed \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". If you are not yet acquainted with Jane Austen's books, this may give you a foretaste of future delights, as you may choose to explore her work.
B000071K5L|3.0|To Kill a Mockingbird is about growing up and coming of age in the Deep South.  It centers around the Finch family:  Atticus Finch is the father and a lawyer, Scout the spunky girl who can rough and tumble with the best of the boys, and Jem the older brother.  The story focuses on the day to day wanderings of Jem and Scout and how their lives change as a result of the trial their father gets involved in.  Atticus defends a black man accused of raping a white woman.  It's a trial that he has no hope of winning, but he tries his hardest because that's what is right.      It's a good story because it shows tolerance and acceptance.  It asks the reader to step into another person's shoes to see life from their point of view before passing judgement.  It was a good read and I liked Lee's writing style.  That said, it's not a favorite and not one that I'd pick up again.  It just didn't ressonate with me like I was hoping it would.
1595141715|5.0|I was rarely able to put this book down, and when I did, I was dreaming about picking it back up. It held my attention from the first page all the way to the last. The subject of this book, suicide, was handled in a very tasteful, yet intriguing and suspenseful way. This is one book that I will never forget, I highly reccomend it.
0545128285|3.0|Quick read.  Nice accompaniment to the Harry Potter books.  The best fairy tale of the bunch is \\"The Tale of the Three Brothers\\".  It's this tale that was introduced to us muggles in Harry Potter 7, The Deathly Hallows.  The most enjoyable part of the book for me was reading Albus Dumbledore's notes on the tales.  Cute read, but only if you are a fan of the Harry Potter books.
0375842209|5.0|This was written as a book for young adults, but 100% of our couple's book club loved it.
1580493939|5.0|I truly enjoyed this book.  It's a story of Dorian Gray's journey through life.  There's a great quote, which really is the theme for the entire book...\\"what does it profit a man if he gain the world and lose his own soul?\\" The pleasures and sins Dorian Gray enjoys in life are conveyed onto his portrait.  Ultimately, his portrait ages and warps with each transgression that tarnishes his soul.<br /><br />Wilde has some great narratives and descriptions in the book.  His writing style immersed me in the book.  Very moving.  I can truly see why it's a classic and wish I had read it sooner.
1439102813|5.0|I was afraid to read \\"Still Alice\\" as my dad suffered with Alzheimers, and I suffered with him. Yet this book was amazing, and Lisa Genova explained with clarity what a person goes through with this disease, and how their family is affected. Her children rallied around Alice, and the author made it clear how the husband could not handle his perfect, brilliant wife suddently being so affected by Alzheimers. I strongly recommend this book.    Shari Jeffress
0060557818|4.0|This was a really odd book, but wonderfully so.  It's a story about two people really, Richard Mayhew and Lady Door.  Richard has a fairly normal life in London.  That is until he stops to help a girl named Door, who he finds bleeding on the street.  This small act of kindness on Richard's part launches him into the world of London Below where all the people that fall through the cracks of London Above reside.  Richard must now figure out how to survive in this place of darkness and monsters.  He seeks out the one person he knows from London Below, Lady Door, to help him.  But, she's on her own quest to determine who murdered her family and sent assassins after her.
B000O174CM|5.0|I am going to make this short as possible. This is one of my favorte movies. I seen this in the movie theatre, on the regular DVD so many scenes have been cut out.Blu ray special feature you get every scene, but you would need a USB flash memory card to really enjoy the whole movie. This movie is a must have on blu ray for the true music lover.
0312360266|2.0|Marked has an interesting premise and a slight change from the normal thought of vampyres.  Apparently, everyone knows about vampyres...they're common place.  Once you're marked, you start to go through the change.  You have to move into the House of Night, which is a boarding school of sorts for vampyres.  That is, if you make it through the change, and a lot don't.    We are introduced to Zoey Redbird, the main character, just as she is marked and get to follow her on her journey of changing schools, and friends, and learning to cope in her new environment.   At the House of Night, there's your usual cast of teen high school characters; the hot boy that everyone secretly crushes on and ooh...of course he's going to fall for the new girl; the hellish in crowd that are stuck up and act like they run the school; and the geeky oddballs who become fast friends to the herione.  Even with all the predictable characters, the story was ok.  At times, I felt more like I was reading about a Wiccan coven than vampyres.  Perhaps that changes as the series progresses.      The main fault with the book is the execution.  Some of the wording is just plain dumb and pulls me out of the story of the book thinking: Really?  Seriously?  Jokes about boobies and poopie?!?  Maybe if the story was dealing with a boarding school for grade school kids, but not something I'd expect to see in a story about teens.  I would have rated the book 3 stars, because by the end, the writing got a little less obsurd and I wanted to know what happened next.  I may even pick up the next book in the series to see where the story leads Zoey and her friends.  However, for sheer lack of execution, the book gets a 2 star rating from me.
B001GCUO1G|3.0|***SPOILERS***    Basically, there were a lot of consistency flaws with \\"Wolverine\\" and the other \\"X-Men\\" movies and of course the 30+ years of source material in the comics. After reading many Jackman interviews leading up to the movie's release, I was really shocked by how the movie was a lot different than he claimed it would be, in consistency and overall story. The one comment he repeated over and over and I'm paraphrasing was that he wanted the movie to be like you could watch it, then put in \\"X-Men\\" and it would literally make you believe that he walked right into that bar in Canada (in \\"X-Men\\" 1) from the ending of \\"Wolverine.\\" That's not the way I feel after watching it.     Basically here are the inconsistencies which really detract from the movie for me as a fan:    *Wolverine's origin as a kid and his relationship with Victor Creed AKA Sabertooth--Sabertooth was Wolverine's father, not brother, in the comic. In the first \\"X-Men\\" they didn't elaborate or even make it apparent that Logan/Wolverine even knew Sabertooth. He was just a throwaway (literally) bad guy, with no character development in the first \\"X-Men.\\"    *The facility where Wolverine is \\"created\\" is NOT the same one from \\"X-Men 2.\\" Alkali lake--you know, where Jean Grey/Phoenix has to save the X-Men--was up in Canada and was completely different.    *Deadpool is NOTHING like he is in the comic book, except when he is \\"Wade\\" at the beginning. The abomination they create at the end is NOTHING like Deadpool and why is it that in these movies they always feel they need to give the final bad guy who is mysteriously created, all of the powers of everyone. Wolverine still dispatched him quite easily.     *Memory erased. COME ON, only an adamantium bullet can pierce Wolverine's skull and Stryker is so sure that he is going to hit the right parts of Wolverine's brain to erase his memory...both long term and short term...is that why he shot him 2-3 times? Come on! I think in the other movies (and know in the comics) the memory wipe was part of the whole Weapon X procedure. He escapes the Weapon X facility not knowing who or what he is.    *Silver Fox. Unnecessary love interest with Lifetime original movie channel cliched betrayal, forgiveness, then second final death. Honestly, they ruined her good early scenes with the incoherent plot of the 3rd act.     *Underwhelming action scenes. For a big summer movie I felt this movie had the least spectacular action scenes. There is one memorable one...where he is on the motorcycle and then gets on top of the military vehicle, just as it gets blown up and he flies through the air towards the helicopter. (And if you saw the trailer, you saw the best action scene already.)    *Too many underdeveloped characters. My God, this was supposed to be \\"Wolverine\\" not \\"X-Men 4\\"--even Jackman was adamant that it not be thought of as that. So why have mutant team after mutant team pop up in the movie? Every character, besides, Wolverine, is so underdeveloped that you could remove them and never miss them. The one unique new character, Gambit, was so underused that it made no sense to have him in it.    *Young Cyclops and Professor X. Come on, talk about flagrant cameos that serve no purpose. If Cyclops had been in that testing facility, don't you think he would have remembered it years later when he and the X-Men return to it in \\"X-Men 2\\"? (Marvel, if you need help with continuity, hire me.)    Enough about the bad stuff...    Hood did a good job with the good actors, getting average to good performances out of them, but with the not so good actors, he was not so lucky.     I honestly felt this was a good movie, but fell short of so much potential. 87 million US gross is not bad, but expect a huge drop-off this week due to (a) bad worth of mouth and (b) \\"Star Trek\\" opening. I think it might break even in the US and then make up money on DVD sales. It won't come close to the \\"X-Men\\" movies in gross though.     3/5
0061139378|4.0|The story is about Coraline Jones.  She's an inquisitive little girl, an explorer, that doesn't seem to get a lot of attention at home.  On one of her explorations, she finds a door in the house that leads to nowhere, it's literally bricked up.  Upon opening the door another day, she finds there's a passageway behind it.  When she enters the passageway, she finds herself back in her house, but is it?  She meets her Other Mother and her Other Father.  They seem the same as her real parents, but they're much more attentive and they have black buttons for eyes.  After enjoying a day with her Other parents, Coraline goes back home and the real adventure starts.  Cute story.      This was my first foray into Neil Gaiman's writing and I was not dissapointed.  I love the worlds that Gaiman creates.  I'm a definite fan!
B001AVEJ1Y|4.0|Minor Spoilers...nothing you haven't read...     I went into seeing \\"Star Trek\\" with probably the most open mind I have in a long time, particularly for a reboot. (\\"Casino Royale\\" was the last one I gave a chance.)     From the opening moments with the attack on Kirk Sr.'s ship, with the transition back and forth between the battle and Kirk's wife and newborn baby, Kirk, Jr., escaping the ship--I knew my wife and I were in for a whole new Trek, no pun intended.     The casting for the main characters was spot-on and for the most part, they tried to give a unique portrayal of these iconic characters. For the most part it works and adds a fresh take but at times it does seem like they are playing caricatures of the original cast. (For example, Chekov is played with the same accent that Koenig made famous, and seems like he is overdoing Koenig.)    The special effects are a feast for CGI lovers, but for Trek purists who loved the models of the original Trek movies, it may seem a little to stylistic and chaotic. Also, the design of the Enterprise is more along the lines of a next-gen ship versus what the original Enterprise would have been like.     The musical score is something that grew on me, as it only has the original famous musical cues very briefly towards the end and with the closing credits.     The overall plot was good, but screewriters Orci and Kurtzman, while able to breath new life into a dead franchise, also relied on the franchise's most dreaded crutch--the time travel/alternate reality story. Did they make it fresh? Yes and no. Just as it is the key plot device it also has set up a new Trek franchise that can't really be viewed and then you pull out the original series and the classic movies and it be consistent with them. Sure we basically have two alternate timelines, what happened in the classic show/movies and now what has happened in the new movie. But it would have been nice to have a prequel franchise you could watch that would lead you right into the series and the movies and be consistent and not redo Trek canon and lore.     All in all, as a Trek fan I thought it exceeded my expectations and was the first solid movie of the \\"summer blockbuster\\" movie season. With the \\"origin\\" story told, they are free to explore so much more in character and plot with the next installment. Sure this one was not exactly Gene Roddenberry deep in political and social context and substituted those deep themes for one roller coaster after another action tour de force, but it still managed to reboot the franchise, but retain much about what people love about Star Trek, in regards to humor and relationships. Welcome back, Enterprise and crew, it's been awhile.     8/10
B000W9DTG6|4.0|Originally I loved these movies cause it has to do with my Hometown, Las Vegas, NV. Plus they have a lot of great stars in them, and they're well played out scheming movies :). Got a great deal on them from amazon.com and will continue to shop for movies at this site for sure!
B00005ASHM|1.0|Greatest album ever?  Try worst album ever, I can't believe I fell for those erroneous reviews.  As a \\"gen Xer\\" who appreciates 60's, particulary \\"hippie\\" music, I think this is a very bad melodic and boring album.  Sorry boomers, your youthful nostalgia is serving you poorly. Next time I will be more careful when I read the reviews of the geriactric demographic...
B001EN71DQ|5.0|Now I remember as just a little girl, my dad letting me watch The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi as the very first of the Star Wars trilogy that we owned at the time. So naturally ever since I was a kid I loved Star Wars entirely and was anxious when the Special Edition came out, and then when the 3 Pre-Trilogy movies hit theaters. Amazon.com had a great deal... $29.99 for all 3 plus the bonus disks???? AMAZING!

B000GZKJUA|5.0|My kids had allot of fun with this toy. They made him go to the store and race with the other Mattel cars we have. The wheels stay on well and so does the other parts of the car. It rolls really easy and is fun.
B0015DYIH2|3.0|i love the previous three books, but the forth one was a total let down.  Breaking Dawn is a great book up until the end.  The changes that Bella and Edward goes through makes the book a fun and exciting read, but I feel like SM builds you up through the entire book to get ready for this huge battle to ensue, but it gets dealt with.  Don;t get me wrong, I like the way that she decided to resolve the matter, but the way she builds you up, it feels like a disappointment.  I do not regret reading the book at all, it tied all the loose ends that remained in the first three.  The ending was a good ending, just not what you expect.  Happy reading!

B00168OINK|5.0|One of the best new family movies to come out in the last few years.
034537410X|3.0|This is a decent overview and guidebook to lucid dreaming, from a researcher who appears to be well respected and is approaching a new-age-ish subject from a scientific perspective.      The reason I don't rate this book higher is that it seems to be BOTH an overview and a guidebook, with no distinction in format or presentation.  I personally found that I had trouble locating the intellectual information on research, theories, and implications when I wanted those, and the same with the how-to when I wanted that.    I would advise those interested in this subject to stick to Dr. LaBerge's writings, and any similar authors grounded in scientific principles.  The topic is rife with anecdotes and personal opinions; take advantage of anyone's objective research when you can.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|I still can't believe how good this movie is. It's going to be really hard for them to make another Batman. I doubt they can make one as good as The Dark Knight!
B001PPLJIQ|4.0|This movie had everything in it I should love: an unconventional love affair/sex relationship, a historical angle that's always fascinating, a first class cast with Kate Winslet in an Oscar-winning performance, a European setting.<br /><br />I'd read the book and loved it.  You got much more of the male lead's inner thoughts and emotions about the overwhelming guilt of the Holocaust on the German generation that followed World War II.  How do you ask your father what he did during that dark and evil time?  How do you look at the generation before you and not wonder how many of them participated in that black mark on humanity?<br /><br />But I was left at the end of the book wondering about went on inside Hanna's brain.  Could there have been scenes where the Ralph Fiennes character confronts her, questions her, gets the whole story?  Well, there wasn't much of that in the book and there's even less in the movie.  The scenes between the adult Michael and his elderly former lover are nearly without any dialogue at all.  I was left wondering if Hanna's final actions in the end were because of her monstrous past or the dry, perfunctory way in which Michael treats her (she realizes that she may have damaged this kid's relationship for life).  I didn't see much of an answer for myself.<br /><br />Then I read an article written by an angry critic who resents the recent Hollywood films that attempt to rehabilate the German people for the Holocaust.  VALKYRIE was given as another example (did the Tom Cruise character wish to assassinate Hitler because of his evil crimes against humanity--or because Germany was by then losing the war?).  The complaint against THE READER was that Hanna is given a pass, so to speak, because of her illiteracy--yet she knew what was happening at the camps.  Are we supposed to feel more sorry for her than the millions sent to their deaths in the Nazi death machine?  It's a sticky point and the guilt of that terrible time will go on for generations.<br /><br />But I liked the movie.  I wish it had gone farther in playing out the confrontation of evil between the generations, between the lovers, between each person in the story.<br /><br />Worth seeing.  Definitely worth thinking about afterward.  Not many movies give you that these days.ovie.

B001AXEOKI|5.0|This was the album that got me hooked on the Cure. I owned it on vinyl. I owned it on cassette. Now I own it on CD. This is a MUST HAVE for anyone who likes 80s music. I LOVE IT!
B0019FOC5E|4.0|I can be very critical of musicals that use quality actors who do not have quality voices. \\"Man of LaMancha\\" was a great disappointment. But ABBA's music is so much fun you can overlook the \\"sing along\\" quality of some of the voices, and sing along too. It's a fun movie to see and a great album to sing along with or just listen to and enjoy. Don't misunderstand - there is some quality, impressive singing on this album too.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|I am a big fan of Chris Martin and Coldplay and this CD did not disappoint.  Besides Viva La Vida, which I still haven't gotten tired of playing, the other tracks are good to great.  Hope they can continue to create great music.
B001FBSMF8|5.0|This is a great album however the only people who will appreciate it are those who are open to change and their favorite artist engaging in new sound.  Those who are chained to genre architypes are always going to be disappointed when their favorite artist tries new things.    If you want the same thing that was done in the past, go back in time and listen to the same Soundgarden album you were listening to 15 years ago.    Evolve or die.
B001GM28HO|4.0|This album is top-tier pop.  Great beats, clever synth/vocal combinations that will stick in your head for weeks.    Obviously the flagship song is \\"Just Dance\\", but I find myself listening to hidden gems like \\"Starstruck\\", \\"Love Game\\", and \\"I Like It Rough\\" more and more each day.    So much of this album is creative and fun, and it's perfect for headphones.
0920668372|5.0|What a beautiful book for a little boy. I bought it for my daughter to read to my grandson.
0307408833|3.0|I just got the book today, so I haven't actually tried any recipes yet, but I'm already bitterly disappointed.  I couldn't believe there were so many gluten containing recipes in a book clearly labeled gluten-free!  Yes, it's easy to sub, and I fully plan to give a few of them a shot, but still...it's misleading and wrong.<br />I was also disappointed in the high number of recipes that used rice flour as the main flour ingredient.  I stopped using rice flour less than a year after going wheat-free, because products made with it always seem gritty to me.  Again, I will give it a try, because surely they haven't gotten their reputation for nothing, but I'm dubious, especially after reading that the icing recipe isn't the same one used in the store.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I think there's also a certain amount of bad luck involved.  After Vegan Cupcakes Take Over the World, there's just such a high expectation, it's difficult to live up to.
0783222149|4.0|This movie is a tense thriller about a vacationing family on a whitewater rafting trip in the Montana wilderness that turns tragic. Filmed in the Kootenai National Forest in NW Montana and the Siskiyou National Forest in SW Oregon, with stunning telephoto shots of the whitewater action and beautiful river canyon photography makes this film journey worth taking.
B001U891HE|2.0|I just purhased this version of Shakespeare's Complete Works and there is no table of contents when you open it! How am I supposed to navigate without a ToC?? Maybe mine will update like the other customer said his did, but right now I'm very disappointed with this purchase.
B001TH16DI|2.0|I was tempted to buy this set, until:    1.  The trilogy pack (II, III, and IV) costs LESS THAN HALF of this set.  So this set is overpriced.  2.  Original theatrical prints, really?  So TMP (1979) is its full uncut w/original effects snoozefest?  Is Trek VI both in 2.35:1 ratio and had a lot of chopped footage restored (I saw it three times in two weeks in 1991 and remember a lot of McCoy scenes being removed for the video release)  3.  Why not include the TNG movies as well?  Because the shallow revamp of the Kirk cast has hit the screens and nobody wants to see Picard for the moment? (Kirk in TOS may have been cocky, but he used his wit and wasn't just a vain twit.  Amongst a list of nitpicks so long, even the crass \\"Nemesis\\" can be forgiven...)  4.  1080i may be pawned off as \\"high def\\", but most people with 1080p sets and who bought into blu-ray are rightfully expecting 1080p definition.    5.  I'll go along with others' comments about excessive DNR.  Their descriptions have a ring of truth to them (I've used DNR when doing VHS->DVD transfers), and too many people are saying the same things to simply ignore.  6.  Can I mention that the trilogy movie set (II, III, and IV) costs only 25~33% of the 6-movie set?  I already did?  Well, it's such a good reason I felt I had to say it twice.  A literal quadruple-dip.    I will wait for a definitive Blu-ray set and after all 3 tv series are re-released, with the original f/x.  (the special edition f/x, while having better camera angles, have cheap CGI that looks more cartoony than anything.)
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|This is a great series. The characters and plot will charm you and keep you entertained. A fresh take on the old series, it still holds true to the Dr. Who of the past. This one happens to be my favorite so far because it combines all the characters I've loved from previous seasons at some point, while giving us new ones to enjoy as well. The box art and extras add to the quality.
B000000XBC|5.0|If you remember the lp's and the 45's and how they sounded, right up until the first scratch, you will get an inkling of the quality and the power this group was capable of!!  I like the sharpness that digital can do with the medium.  First rate job!!!
B000BO0LKY|5.0|i think this cd is one of the best by mariah carey so far i love all of the songs on this album and can play it all the way though unlike some of her other albums it has all you need all in one cd that's the best thing and anyone that has been a mariah carey fan and dosen't like this album at all i would be suprised because you have ballads and up beat songs and songs to dance to on this cd that is why it is so great i would say buy this cd with confidence if you don't already have it i have this version and the regular version that's how much i like this cd and i have had them both since them came out great buy great listen and great artwork my favorite songs on this album is 1.we belong together 2.mine again 3.fly like a bird 4.don't forget about us 5.it's like that 6.shake it off 7.say somethin
B001EN71DQ|5.0|I purchased the original trilogy when it hit DVD. I intentionally avoided seeing these till this was released and I am glad I did.

B000Q6GUT8|3.0|The film begins with camouflaged snipers overlooking a valley. A convoy drives down a road and is targeted. Then the hunters become the hunted. Were they betrayed? Government agents meet the survivor and ask him to plan an assassination so they can stop it. The sniper explains the difficulty in shooting a target from a mile away. A plea is made. This lone gunman will take the assignment. Cameras allow \\"Big Brother\\" to watch people in the streets of Washington. Next he visits Philadelphia, the most likely venue. After his report they want him to be a spotter. The President arrives to make a speech. There is a surprise. [Was it telegraphed?] Now Swagger must escape from the good guys as well as the bad guys. He makes a daring escape to the river.    The new FBI agent tells what happened and is cautioned about speaking. The corporate media convict Swagger in their news reports. [Who writes them?] Swagger treats himself for blood loss with a saline solution. Sugar was used to treat wounds for centuries. Swagger looks up the girl friend of his dead buddy and asks for help. \\"Bad things happen to good people.\\" The new FBI agent Nick Memphis investigates the discrepancies and finds answers. \\"It wasn't my fault.\\" Swagger tries to contact that Nick Memphis. More drama follows. Nick is abducted and tortured. But help arrives in time to rescue him. An expert explains how a duplicate bullet could be created. And tells of an expert shooter who could have done the job.    Who is \\"Sczerbiak Mikhaylo\\"? \\"No loose ends this time.\\" There is a meeting where a confession is given to Swagger. Is this a trap? There is a shoot-out and explosions for an exciting finish. Will there be a deal? There is more drama in the snowy mountains. Senator Meacham explains the facts of life. The FBI helicopters arrive. There is a final meeting in Washington with a trick about that rifle. And so it ends. Will Swagger get his revenge on the bad guys for a happy ending? Does the flaming ending satisfy the audience?    The first part of the story echoes the JFK assassination then turns into a chase story that echoes \\"Rambo\\". The last part is a typical action film with shootings and explosions for the story of an agent betrayed by his government but who survives at the end. Films are made to be commercially successful by a design that Hollywood perceives will sell to the public. While many of the events in this film echo historical events, stringing them all together seems unlikely for this morality play.
1400031354|5.0|My daughter and son-in-law gave me the first book in this series, and I was hooked.  These books are simply yet beautifully written (a vital quality for me), and the characters are so real, so well-defined, and so human.  In addition, there are beautiful descriptions of Botswana, and Africa in general, making the reader feel and \\"see\\" the settings, and appreciate the beauty of the place as the characters do.  They do not want to live in America or elsewhere--they are proud of being African, and Botswanan in particular.  In a simple yet poignant way, I felt humbled as an American who subconciously senses somehow that America is the center of the universe.  These are such charming reads, and I am finishing my eighth in the series, and awaiting the ninth!  If you want a lovely, diverting read, particularly after reading something deeper, more depressing or violent, this is the book you need.  Though easy to read, these books are appropriate for serious readers--trust me!
B000R4SMD6|4.0|One comes to expect quality in an Anthony Hopkins movie.<br />He has become one of the truly great actors of our time<br />by making his roles interesting, original, and many times important.<br />In this one he plays an elderly genius with a younger cheating wife.<br />He stacks the evidence so that he gets off and disgraces the young lawyer who is prosecuting him. The twist at the end changes everything.<br />I liked it: the movie makes you wonder where the gun<br />is and the solution is just another mind game played out:<br />a very strange movie from the start.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|WOW! Abrams has done the unthinkable! He made Star Trek cool? It seems he has upset a legion of Trekkie's in the process. It also seems that these Trekkie's believe that there is a person alive that could have tied all the knots and plot holes together from the 10 previous films. Paramount knew that wasn't possible so they decided to do the only thing they could do and that is to start over. You really need to think of this as a new Star Trek and not a prequel. Anyone would be a fool to believe it would be possible to cater to every Trekkie on the planet. Any filmmaker would've pissed off at least a few thousand Trekkie's. On the flip side Abrams has introduced the idea of Star Trek to a whole new generation that would've cared less about the series otherwise. He has taken this dead franchise and breathed new life into it. The hot new cast is young hip and fresh and they all fit into these roles so naturally thanks to brilliant casting. Abrams has given us a new, smarter, fresher, funnier, hipper, sexier, and more thrilling Star Trek than ever! I applauded the Trekkie's that appreciate that and love this movie as much as the classics that inspired it.
B002436WJE|1.0|In my personal opinion, I don't think Liam Neeson is cut out for James Bond type of action thrillers. Even though he pulls it off, he is too intelligent of an actor and the roles he has played in his other films have had more depth and substance to them. The story of the film is interesting and reminded me of Mel Gibson's Ransom which is similar in that both actors play fathers whose child is kidnapped. There were multiple ethnic groups represented as the \\"bad guys\\" and I didn't get a sense of how they were all connected to each other. The film moves very quickly without much continuity between the scenes unfortunately. I like Liam Neeson as an actor. I did not like this film.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|The reason I ordered this dvd was because I was watching the series on PBS and I just couldn't wait a whole week for the next episode, yes, it is that good. There are many twists to the story that made it funny at times. One of the things I like about it, is that I can relate to main character, I too wish to take part of the story and meet Mr. Darcy. I don't know what Jane Austen would think about it but as for me I liked it. It was highly entertainning. The only dissapointing part is that there is a deleted a scene but I was lucky to find it in YOUTUBE.

0783116934|5.0|What an amazing film!<br /><br />A made-for-cable movie about the most notorious serial killer in Russian history, and the man who did everything he could to stop him.  I may make it sound hokey, but it truly is an amazing film about a true life cat and mouse game.<br /><br />In Soviet Russia in the early 1980s, a new forensics expert, Viktor Burakov (played by Stephen Rea), takes over and inherits quite a mess.  In a bureaucracy that gets little done and disregards so much because of Soviet ideology, it is an achievement just to have a forensics expert.  After a decomposing body arrives, he orders a thorough search and eight more bodies are recovered.  Coupled with seven prior unsolved murders (most of children and young women), Burakov suspects a serial killer.  He is immediately stopped in his pursuits to find the killer when the bureaucracy gets in the way.  But he does find a friend in the seasoned manipulator Col. Fetisov (played by Donald Sutherland).  And together they take on the Soviet bureaucracy and the serial killer, as Fetisov makes Burakov the head of their new \\"Killer Department.\\"  Later in the film, Max von Sydow joins in to help, in a small, but intense roll.<br /><br />In a film with such overwhelming subject matter, there were numerous scenes of slight humor, or just endearing ideas, i.e. when Burakov says he knows because he saw it in an American movie--just a great scene with the warm sentiment that movies do teach us.<br /><br />It is also an incredibly encouraging story: even with so much set against him, Burakov is able to stay with this case and see it through, never once giving up.<br /><br />Some of the graphic and gory scenes of some of the murders are a bit disturbing, but they keep things to a minimum (thankfully).<br /><br />It is an excellent film that shows great humanity in the face of daunting horrors.  It is historical, political, and would suit people into crime dramas, police stories, and anyone interested in a good film.  Incredibly acted, this film is definitely worth watching and I recommend owning it.y worth watching and I recommend owning it.

She is almost 3 and she still wants to go to sleep with this book.  also anytime during the day if she is getting grumpy we just pull out a couple books to read and this one is always first because she can do the motions along with reading.   Great book!
B001O2ZW1A|5.0|Wilson is indeed a prolific composer, juggling many band projects including Porcupine Tree and No Man, not to mention a diversity of genres that span everything from melodic folk to progressive rock to ambient to death metal. Somehow he manages to artfully cram all this into Insurgentes. This is indeed a challenging and satisfying release.
0316010669|4.0|This book was fascinating... Malcolm Gladwell can sure tell a good story and run a persuasive and provocative argument. As I was reading, I had some concerns about the implications, particularly about stereotypes and marketing, but Gladwell not only addressed them, but put them in a deeper context. An insightful read!  However...  I did get the uncomfortable sense that there may be studies or examples out there that did not agree with Gladwell's hypothesis, and that he just ignored them. I assumed he just cherry-picked the studies that would help his case.  I also couldn't figure out enough ways to apply this personally to my own life and my own actions.Ultimately I am a very practical person, and I want to know what to DO with the information, not just have random facts floating around in my brain somewhere. I also was concerned about the marketing implications of this book, even after Gladwell's discussion.
B000056K04|1.0|I've been a DMB fan since before they were popular, and this is the album that I refused to let people play on my stereo in college. First of all, the cover makes me want to throw up in my mouth. Some of the songs are alright, but the whole album has a feel that leaves a bad taste in my mouth (again my vomit) DMB wanted to put out Lillywhite Sessions, but it was too \\"real\\" and \\"good.\\" So they forced the band to record an entire new album of dull, watered down crap that turned into this album. Luckily, the forces of evil were thwarted and more people downloaded Lillywhite than bought this album.
1423113497|5.0|My asperger DS12 cannot put these books down.  For years I have absolutely begged him to read fiction books, but he couldn't get into them the way most kids do.  Now, don't get me wrong, non-fiction books are great...but I was wanting him to expand his horizons.      In reading the synopsis of this series, I liked how they made a kid with similar challenges to my DS a type of \\"special\\" hero.  When I got the package, I told him that I would like him to read the first few chapters before he made a judgement about whether he disliked the book or not.  He read the first book in just a little over a day.  He finished the last page of the first book and instantly picked up the second and started reading.  Over breakfast he was telling me about the finished book, and was nearing hypervenilation he was SO EXCITED about them.       He has already loaned out the first book to a friend, with the explicit instructions he wants it back so he can read it again.      Both me and his dad are considering this series a true blessing in that it has possibily opened up a whole new level of reading for him.
0681807148|5.0|This book is really good but really boring if that makes any sense lol.

1558908382|4.0|Recently I bought the (sort of) sequel to this great movie, [[ASIN:B0015XHQVC War, Inc.]]which was not excellent. But it did remind me of how much I loved this movie and hadn't seen it in years so I ordered a copy which arrived this week, and today I sat down and watched it again, and it is still a Dark Comic gem.<br /><br />Full of manic ramblings, fun action and redemptive romance, this remains a favorite of mine, 12 years later.<br /><br />4 ¼ *
B001AVEJ1Y|4.0|Continuing the trend of reinventing sixties iconic figures such as Batman and James Bond, Star Trek was inevitably next in line.  For those who fretted that the new incarnation of creator Gene Roddenberry's  beloved franchise of `Wagon Train to the Stars' would be dishonored or ignored, they needn't worry.  This new version, intended to reboot the franchise that was so popular in TV reruns and subsequently in a series of big budget films, is a remarkably balanced take on the origins of the classic Enterprise crew.  It is designed to appeal to the non-initiated audience while referencing the existing canon of Star Trek lore.  Director J. J. Abrams (Fringe, Alias, Mission Impossible III) brings a fresh vision abetted by Trekkie fan/writers, Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman.      James T. Kirk is born as his father rescues a starship crew during a Romulan attack led by the mysterious Nero (Eric Bana).  A young rebel who grows into a brash, thrill seeking adventurer, young Kirk (Chris Pine) is recruited into Star Fleet Academy by Captain Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood).  Meanwhile the half Vulcan / half human Mr. Spock (Zachary Quinto) has matured amid bullying kids and decides his destiny lies with The Federation as a cadet instead of his home planet Vulcan.  Kirk strikes up a friendship with an ornery young Doctor Leonard McCoy (Karl Urban is a hoot) whose distrust of space and things not medical will become legendary.  It is McCoy who devises a way for Kirk to become a crew member of the newly commissioned starship Enterprise.  In fact, most of what will become the core crew is assembled including communications officer Uhura (Zoe Saldana), helmsmen Sulu (John Cho) and Chekov (Anton Yelchin), and later, engineer Scotty (Simon Pegg).  Seeking vengeance against the Federation, Nero has traveled through time to exact pain and destruction with a planet killing device that will draw the Enterprise to Vulcan and ultimately Earth.  With the Universe in the balance, Kirk and Spock must decide if they can work together (with the help of a certain mentor).       The parallel life paths of Kirk and Spock are marked contrasts of two men who will clash and reconcile their future relationship.  Kirk smacks of hawkish, shoot-from-the-hip reactionary while Spock is the logical, think-inside-the-box good soldier.  Nero reminds us a bit of Khan from Wrath of Khan.  The character of Uhura is a major upgrade.  She is a multi-talented officer who has romantic longings for a certain Vulcan.  Greenwood shines as the veteran Pike.  Leonard Nimoy makes a welcome, pivotal appearance as an elder Spock who figures prominently in the history that is to come.  The cast makes the most of iconic roles and excels at recreating the personas of what we remember; each crew member gets an opportunity to shine.  It is nice to see this group working and improvising together for the first time to solve a crisis.  Further, this story takes it for granted as does its audience that this crew is not only multicultural, but multi-species, a far cry from the novelty of the integrated crew of classic Trek.      The screenplay has some well written dialogue and clever Trek  references sprinkled throughout, and age old lines of the classic show are introduced for the first time.  When McCoy utters, \\"I'm a doctor, not a physicist\\", it's a riot.  Part of the fun is watching two heavyweights like Kirk and Spock faceoff and slowly bond and seeing how Kirk ascends to the captain's chair.  We finally get to learn what the `Kobayashi Maru' wargame really is and how Kirk manages to defeat the test.      Sure, the plot has some gaping holes if you think about continuity and the fate of a certain venerable, classic character.  Nero's motives are explained in time, but they don't make total sense.  This film also does not have the gravitas of deep themes as previous films which is perhaps its only true failing, but instead, we get a strong character study that more than compensates.Technical effects are quite impressive although Abrams seems to favor close-ups and tight camera setups that put the viewer in the middle of action scenes.  Fortunately, there are no jarring Cloverfield handheld camera moves.   There is a good fight sequence on a weapons platform and a surprise on an ice planet.  You want phasers shooting back and forth in space battle?  You've got them here.  In fact the energy level keeps this voyage bouncing along.      The Enterprise is stunning-it has never looked quite this way ever, and it is cool how they depict the starship going into warp drive.  There are imaginative points of view when showing off the ship's exterior, and the interior is brimming with activity and sound, which is in stark contrast to the more antiseptic views from the earlier show.  The costumes (complete with female miniskirts) harken back to that period and yet seem fresh.  At credits' end, there is a nice dedication to the Roddenberrys, Gene and Majel Barrett (who voices the Federation computer one last time).    Fans of the old show may tear up at how faithful and creative Abrams and his screenwriters are with Trek lore and how they set everything up nicely going forward.  This is their alternate universe now, and we are game for the experience.  This crew, baptized under fire, is ready for new missions, and they cannot come soon enough.  Way to go, Mr. Abrams.  This Trek rocks!
B001AQO46E|5.0|This is one of Arnold's best performances. Oh and what about Jamie Lee Curtis, oh so great too. Tom Arnold is over the top as usual. Love him.<br />I agree this needs to be released soon. We are all on standby to get this one on Blu-ray, so let's get it done . Please!
B0015AARJI|5.0|I got one of these when I bought my first PS3.  The PS3 is an awesome machine, but the games a little high priced right now and blu ray is just insane.  I will wait til these get as cheap as the playstation ones and buy one.  I bought a PS1 again because it has the best games , and even though the graphics are dated, it brings back great memories.  This controller though has a USB connector cable which you attach to your ps3 and it charges it right there for you.  That is a very nice idea Sony had.  Then it is wireless.  It has a much better range than the Nintendo Wii controllers because I used to have that system as well.  Definately buy this controller if you have a ps3.

0240810961|5.0|DRAWN TO LIFE:  20 GOLDEN YEARS OF DISNEY MASTER CLASSES, VOLUME 1: THE WALT STANCHFIELD LECTURES is a beautiful book for animation students, artists, and admirers alike.  This book works on many levels:  as series of artistic master classes, as an historical record of Disney animation, and as pure entertainment for fans of Walt's work.  A fascinating read, DRAWN TO LIFE chronicles the career and legacy of Walt Stanchfield, the man who inspired and influenced Disney animators for over 30 years.<br /><br />Walt Stanchfield began working for the Walt Disney Studios in the early 1950s.  Almost everyone is familiar with his work.  Peter Pan, Sleeping Beauty, 101 Dalmatians, and The Jungle Book are just a few of the great Disney films that bear his mark.  DRAWN TO LIFE contains the teachings, lectures, and notes that he imparted to the likes of Tim Burton, John Lasseter, and many other animators during his reign at Disney.  Filled with amazing sketches, drawings, and even how-tos, this text is an important document for any aspiring animator, and it is both easy and fun to read.  Walt's experience and insight into the techniques of animation are priceless.<br /><br />I am by no means an artist, but I found DRAWN TO LIFE to be interesting, enjoyable, and educational.  This book is very inspirational; after reading it, I feel like I could pick a pencil and draw a recognizable figure.  Clearly, DRAWN TO LIFE:  20 GOLDEN YEARS OF DISNEY MASTER CLASSES, VOLUME 1: THE WALT STANCHFIELD LECTURES is a must have for anyone interested in art and animation.
0143038583|5.0|\\"The Omnivore's Dilemma,\\" by Michael Pollan, is a thought-provoking look at the way we eat, unlike any other book out there. Pollan's devotion to producing top notch literature truly comes through in this book. He takes us all over the country--and all through our history--in search of the answer to a seemingly simple question: What's for dinner?<br /><br />Among other places, Pollan travels to a large cornfield in Iowa and a small organic farm, and to industrial feedlots and the woods of California for a hunting trip. Pollan examines every aspect of our food system, from beginning to the end, from the top to the bottom, and the inside and the out. He explores the ethics of hunting and the ethics of vegetarianism, the ethics of buying local and the ethics of buying global, and even the ethics of gathering your own foods. He examines the impact our food system is having on our health and the health of future generations, and the environmental impacts of it, both immediate and long term. He examines how our food system has became what it has, what it used to be and where it is going. But Pollan doesn't stop there. He manages to turn every stone in his mission to explain what is for dinner.<br /><br />As a highly skilled writer, Pollan has managed to produce a five-star book on every level--one that you know he worked very hard on because of the wealth of information, the places he traveled, and the amount of books that he had to read in his research. He has the devotion and skill of a top-notch journalist (which he is), the depth and reasoning of a philosopher, and the passion for the outdoor world that only a naturalist and outdoorsman could have. And his writing doesn't lack either. Pollan's style of writing is flowing and coherent and meant to be enjoyed--which is something you don't see much of in non-fiction. His writing is part narrative, part explanatory, and always easy on the eyes. You can tell that Pollan is as concerned with the quality of writing as he is with the information he gives.<br /><br />Overall, this is a five-star book in every way: journalism, science and nature writing; literature and prose; narrative and argumentative, exploratory writing and in-depth research. In the end, Pollan comes off completely non-partisan and he explores every way at looking at every issue. If anything, Pollan comes off as sympathetic and forgiving to every viewpoint--he finds the logic in industrial and small organic farming, hunting and not hunting, and vegetarianism and meat eating. This is truly a book meant for every one of us, as it applies to every one of us.mation he gives.

B001PJRAUS|5.0|A unique storyline for everyone addicted to anything Pride & Prejudice. The only negative to this US released DVD is that there is an entire scene deleted (I understand due to copyright issues?) where Amanda sings \\"Downtown\\". With that portion deleted, the reactions following make no sense.  I recommend anyone buying this to go to YouTube and watch the missing scene.  I would request to Amazon to push the company that released this DVD to obtain permission and rerelease a \\"complete\\" version. I for one would buy it!     I wonder if there were any other portions deleted....
B000ICL3KG|1.0|This movie was very boring.Two hours of crying and lying over humans destroying the earth.Scientists have already said the sun is heating up and all the other planets in the solor system are also.So this movie would lke you to think what ever you do on this planet go back to living in the 1800's and buy a horse to ride to work.Come on people were not born yesterday.If you feed into this movie then you must not mind paying a person Cap-And-Trade money to make you feel you are not destroying the planet.This is the worse movie I have ever seen in my life.

B0019LY5IM|4.0|Some spoilers:<br /><br />  In a series that keeps getting stranger and stranger, season 5 was by far the strangest. It was also one of the best though. It starts off with Locke, Sawyer, Juliet, Miles, Ferredy and the redhead Freighter girl stuck on the island together. When Ben turned the wheel in season 4, the island now is constantly moving in time. When they get used to being in one time, the time changes to either the past or the future. Which is a smart way for the writers to introduce us to the Others of the past and Dharma members as well. We also learn some history about the island itself. But the flashes that keeps sending Sawyer and others through time is also slowly killing them. Locke finds a way back home to try and get help for them.<br /><br />  While Jack tries to figure out how to get Kate, Hurley, Sun and Sayid to all come back to the island. Well since none of them are interested in returning.<br /><br />  It's obvious they get back eventually but I won't give away how. But Sawyer and the others get stuck in the late 70's and Sawyer decides to find a way to join the Dharma group. I always felt bad that the Others killed them but we learn that a lot of them were jerks. We also get to meet the Asian from the Dharma films that Locke and Eko were watching. How his character was used was one of the best things about the season.<br /><br />  The season had many surprises and twists. It was a pretty satisfying season even if a lot of the time travel rules were confusing. Since the show always leaves us hanging with our jaws dropped to the floor in the finales, this season was no exception. Hell, I think I never been eager for more since the finale of the first season.
B000089RVX|4.0|To tell you the truth, I didn't really like a few songs on Fallen. \\"Everybody's Fool,\\" \\"Taking Over Me,\\" and \\"My Last Breath\\" didn't work for me, but the rest of the songs did. \\"Going Under\\" caught my attention when I popped the CD into my boombox the first time. I don't think I can ever describe you how hauntingly beautiful it is. \\"Bring Me to Life\\" deserved to be a hit single: hard rock and heavenly vocals are easily a good combination. The piano version of \\"My Immortal\\" is featured here; prefer the full band version, though, but it's still likable. \\"Haunted,\\" \\"Tourniquet,\\" \\"Imaginary,\\" and \\"Hello\\" are some of the more satisfying songs that really pleases both ears. I'm not a big fan of Evanescence, but I do enjoy listening to this album occasionally.
031606792X|1.0|After reading Twilight, and loving it, I was hooked. I read the next 2 without stopping, and then came Breaking Dawn. I could not get through it, I stopped many times and actually skipped about 30 pages and went to the end. Very disappointing. Not what I had expected. If you read the first 3, don't bother with the fourth.
B00004XPPB|5.0|\\"As real as it gets\\", the ultimate mafia film based on the true story of undercover FBI agent Joseph Pistone. Two of Hollywood's great character actors go at it head to head in a life of syndicate crime in the big city, - Al Pacino and Johnny Depp give outstanding performances as Lefty Ruggiero(Pacino) and Joe Pistone (Depp). Pistone's wife is played out brilliantly by Anne Heche, with a fine surrounding supporting cast. The film gives the viewer a realistic idea what it takes to survive in the mob and as a law enforcer playing on the inside of a soldier's deadly game. The real Joe Pistone was so caught up and involved with the mafia, the agent was hesitant to leave, of course now there's a big price on his head. A must see and own film,this special edition of DONNIE BRASCO is loaded with extras and an interview with the real Joe Pistone sporting dark shades. 1997,16x9 widescreen.
1933784032|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I saw Star Wars when I was 10 years old ... and like many other kids, it changed my world. It was the movie of my imagination, with all the costumes, strange creatures, blasters ... and spaceships!     This book takes you into the models used in the original movies, and the prequels too. Was fun to learn some of their techniques, such as \\"model bashing\\" (taking pieces from existing, off-the-shelf model kits) to make some of the ships. The people who create these models are real artists. And this book lets you take a peak behind the curtain!     This book, and \\"The Making of Star Wars: The Definitive Story Behind the Original Film\\" are two must-have books for the Star Wars fan!
031606792X|1.0|I loved Twilight, I loved New Moon. Eclipse kept me interested but Breaking Dawn literally broke my heart.    Personally, I found this book unnecessary and a waste of my time. I read it, cringing as I turned every page. I even rolled me eyes because of the over-used descriptions and unrealistic plot. Now, of course vampires isn't a realistic topic but while reading books 1-3, I believed it was real. The love, the sadness, it felt real. I think everyone wants to feel a love like Bella and Edwards.     Breaking Dawn took a turn for the worst. I understand that people feel they must finish the saga. If you do, read it and form your own opinion about it. Honestly, I don't think one needs to read Breaking Dawn.     Read Twilight, New Moon and Eclipse and save yourself the emotional disappointment that occurs while reading Breaking Dawn.
B000PKG7TI|5.0|This was a great concert for those who like symphonic rock. I didn't know I was one until I discovered this. However this should not be a guide as to the purchase of subsequent Nightwish products. Tarja is what made the group unique and without her they are just another group. Anette, their new singer, is OK but not unique in the way Tarja was. I understand Tarja was probably \\"bitchy\\" after her marriage to that Argentine loser and probably not as \\"controllable\\" as she had been before but Nightwish lost a lot when they dumped her (and they didn't do it in the nicest, most business-like way). Outside of the leader and main song writer there is not much to distinguish the group. To be a commercial success he should have dumped the rest and put up with Tarja. Too bad, but this is their best and it's old by this time.

0061122416|1.0|I rarely write reviews, but I was so let down by this book that I had to. I decided to check it out because of all the hype surrounding it, and see what lessons could be gained from it. In the end, I barely made it halfway through.   The writing style is so simple and repetitive, it could have been written by a teenager. Maybe this is so that it will appeal to a wide audience, but it bored me to distraction. There is nothing that causes you to think hard in this novel, no sublety to language or story or character. Every message is shoved in your face, which I feel is counter productive. I'm of the opinion that if a story doesn't make you think about it when you're not reading, examine its subtleties to understand the characters and what the message is, then it probably won't make a big impact in the long run.   And the underlying message in this story is quite cliche. Follow your dreams, have faith in your dreams and in your \\"Personal Legend\\" and you will overcome all obstacles in the end. Really now? I think this is a message that has been told to us a million times, either by our parents, teachers, or Hollywood movies, and I don't see how this 3rd-grade reading level book would get that point home any better.
B00004W510|5.0|Probably not a great deal has been mentioned about 2009 being the 40th anniversary of the Band's second and finest album. This is not surprising given that they were often overshadowed by more image-oriented, commercially accesible, and generally less interesting bands at the time. I myself recently noted 2009 being the 40th anniversary of Led Zeppelin's first two albums, but this was more of a tongue in cheek gesture as opposed to the adulatory yelps of sycophantic fandom that the Zeppelin review page is replete with. When I accurately criticized Zep as being derivative of blues music, a fanatical type commented underneath quipping that everything in music is derivative of everything. I think it's important to distinguish the difference between influences and derivation as that commentator was unable to do. He was a little overwhelmed by what I had said in my review and clearly out of his depth.    Back to the point, The Band had literally an incalcuable array of styles they incorporated into their performance during their ten years or so of existence. That a single group could perform such a wide variety of music, from elements of country, folk, rockabilly, occasionally even soul and hard rock, is perhaps most attributable to the individual members that made up the Band, their own disparate interests, and the fact that they all were multi-instrumentalists (save Robertson). This then is the first thing that makes the Band special. It is not that any one of their myriad musical influences originated with them, but rather the several different parts (extraordinarily wide by rock standards) combined to create a truly innovative and unique sound. Certainly unlike anything else going on in the late 60's. This was a group interested in making quality music as opposed to following behind whatever banner of any of the sundry collections of fad rock going on at the time.    The second key ingredient here is the voices. Three lead singers, all unlike each other and pretty much unlike any other voice in rock music at the time. A lot of bands struggle to produce a single interesting vocalist, this group had three. The rough, raspy, southern drawl of Levon Helm complemented the songs he sang in a way that no one else would have been able to (\\"Dixie\\" being the supreme example). Rick Danko, somewhat higher than the others, but capable of producing at times an incredibly impassioned delivery (the live version of \\"It Makes No Difference\\" off of the Last Waltz). I don't know whether it's coincidental or not, but many newer singers, particularly of the folk/rock sort of persuasion sound to me very reminiscent of Danko. Thirdly, my personal favorite, Richard Manuel. I don't think there's another singer with a wider range than Manuel in the rock/pop genre. Deep and soulful, sometimes deep and menacing. Sometimes high and soulful, sometimes high and menacing. Sometimes everything in between. Many of my favorite songs from the Band owe as much to Manuel's vocals as anything else.     Thirdly, the songwriting. Unique for the time to be sure, but it remains if not singularly unique, at least still warrants praise for its unusual quality and high degree of intelligence. Robertson's songs are historical/literary in nature, but the emphasis is usually on the historical. \\"The Night They Drive Old Dixie Down\\", a reaction to the end of the Civil War from the loser's perspective is probably the greatest example. \\"King Harvest\\" which deals with the formation of unions in response to labor abuses and more specifically in this case, the smothering of small farmers. Elsewhere, \\"Across The Great Divide\\" and \\"The Unfaithful Servant\\", although probably not as well known as \\"Dixie\\", are nonetheless two of Robertson's finest historical narrative songs in my opinion. Conversely, some tracks place the emphasis on a literary quality, that is a character based lyric. The outstanding example of this, \\"Rockin' Chair\\". It is not often that a songwriter of 25, as Robertsonwas at the time, speculates on old age and a bygone era by virtue of creating a lyric and character in a music performance. Ray Davies of the Kinks is one of the few that I can think of. Also of note is a track that doesn't really fit any of the above descriptions of Robertson's songwriting and that may be because it was co-written by Richard Manuel. The haunting, piano lead \\"Whispering Pines\\" is one of the finest and most overlooked Band songs. That's the importance of this album which can't be stressed enough. A compilation won't cover it. You may get the best known ones, but you'll miss out some real gems; \\"Whispering Pines\\", \\"Rockin' Chair\\", \\"When You Awake\\", etc.

B001CISHU4|5.0|Say it with me: Swedish Melodic Viking Death Metal.      Hey, I'm hooked already!    Seriously, though, this is one great album.  The melodies fit the music perfectly.  The guitars, bass, and drums punish from the opening moments of the first track and contine the sonic assualt through the closing moments of the last track.      I was never a fan of Amon Aarth before, partially because it took me until now to even hear about them.  Trust me.  Where I live, it is very difficult to find great non-American bands.  True the Swedes have always done it better than the Americans.  Case in point number one: Dark Tranquillity.  Perhaps still my favorite band.  Upon listening to AA for the first time, my original impression was that they sounded quite a bit like DT.  That's a good thing.    Not that I'm setting DT as the gold standard for melodic death metal; there are a lot of melodeath bands out there.      I was a bit disappointed in the fact that Twilight of the Thunder God has only ten tracks, but for the extra couple of bucks I paid for the album on iTunes, I got 13 bonus tracks, all recorded live at the 2007 Summer Breeze festival.  For the live tracks, the sound quality is less than perfect, as expected, and for a few moments the lead singer sounded corny when he was talking to the crowd in that low death growl.  It reminds me of the bodybuilder Rex from Napoleon Dynamite.  Still, the live tracks were a welcome addition.  They were all great to listen to, despite the obvious live outdoor environment where the tracks were recorded.    This is an all-around amazing album.  Now my next mission is to go back and get all of AA's old stuff.    Buy it.  You won't be disappointed.  Twilight of the Thunder God gets an incredible 4.8/5 stars.

This book is about two guys that have a major crush on this girl named Margo. Their names are Ben and Q (well, that is his nickname). I think it is a good book for teenagers like me because it teaches you a lesson about how not to run away from school and home. But if you are looking for a book for a young child, this is probably not it, because it has some bad language in it. It is a really good book. Trust me. Oh, it has a really good ending too.

B0007OCG4W|4.0|I love this film. I love it because of it's cutting dialogue and it's dysfunctional characters which are superbly portrayed by a stunning cast. A study of the human heart, Closer shows the intertwined relationships of two couples, forced into mingling by the faults of others. As much as I hate to witness a train wreck, Closer is actually one of those films I'm able to watch over again because it's simple human error, not some tragedy. It's beautifully acted, especially by Portman and Owen. Portman's character shines above the rest as Jane, a strong girl who finds resolution through heartache. For peeps who don't mind the dirt and grit with life sometimes, check this one out.
B000SMWUPS|4.0|This works great with my Peg Perego Aria Oh stroller.  The cup holder that came with the stroller is flimsy and unusable.  And, there is no place to put your keys, etc.    This Buggy Buddy fits great, and holds drinks steady.  Easily holds a fountain soda, and any of the hot/cold drinks from Starbucks.  I usually do the Grande size, and they fit fine.  Don't have to worry about them spilling onto my son!    The pocket is a good size, and holds my phone, keys, wallet, easily.  Also a zippered pocket, which I don't use much, but could be useful.    I am also able to leave the Buggy Buddy on when I fold up the stroller, which makes it even more convenient.    Overall, a great and much-needed addition to my stroller.  I had seen ones that were more expensive, but purchased this based on other reviews here on Amazon.  Definitely not disappointed.

It is also the last book out of the Twilight series. The book took place in Phoenix where Bella grew up. This book is also a fantasy and is one of the best fantasy books in the world. Bella and Edward show love to each other in this book. In this book Bella is not as clumsy as she is in all of the other three books, and she is more loving since she has her own family. The book is about love, romance, and what is going to happen next in her life. The thing is, in this book, what I thought what was going to happen, sometimes turned out being the opposite. In this book Bella has been reborn and has a whole other world on her shoulders. If you are the type of person who likes romance and love stories, or if you are a young reader who loves vampires, then this is the book for you.<br /><br />By DaNita<br />Mrs. Sage's Class
B001PPGAJE|4.0|In the year 2000, Marvel Comics in association with 20th Century Fox officially ushered in the current age of superhero movies with the successful box office smash \\"X-Men\\". Truthfully, out of all of their vast properties to adapt for the silver screen, the X-Men seemed in my estimation to be one of the riskiest endeavors for Marvel in terms of being a hit. I felt it was a risky choice if for no other reason than the fact that the X-Men universe is so rich and diverse that it would seem almost impossible to winnow it down to a manageable level that could easily fit into a 90 minute or two hour running time. Yet, despite a few minor flaws in the story and/or some tweaks to some characters, the difficult task was accomplished in an extremely impressive fashion under the watchful eye of talented director Bryan Singer (\\"The Usual Suspects\\").    \\"X-Men\\" is the story of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), a mutant who has the unique ability to heal from any wound along with unsheathing razor-sharp adamantium (an unbreakable metal) claws from his hands, as he struggles to find the truth about himself, while helping a young mutant named Rogue (Anna Paquin). During their journey the two encounter a team of mutants led by the enigmatic Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), who believes that somehow both humans and mutants can find a way to peacefully co-exist with one another. However, for every school of thought there is an equally strong opposing viewpoint, and this one is led by a powerful and extremely angry mutant named Magneto (Ian McKellan). As battle lines are being drawn, Wolverine and Rogue find themselves stuck in the middle of a war they never knew existed, and are forced to choose a side to stand with before time runs out.    The story for \\"X-Men\\" as written by David Hayter (\\"Watchmen\\") provided a very nice and neat introduction into the expansive universe that these iconic characters inhabit. While this initial film featured a relatively focused story that revolved around the two pivotal roles of Wolverine and Rogue and their quest for answers and acceptance, it hinted at the potential for a much bigger story to follow on a much grander scale. For most franchises to succeed, especially those that could be deemed risky, you need the initial story to be a little smaller in scope in order to draw your audience in and establish the groundwork of relationships with which further sequels can build upon. Writer David Hayter understood this and crafted a very tight and concise script that moved along at an almost relentless pace, yet without really skimping on too many of the details. For comic book fans there were numerous nods or references to either events or characters from the comics, but this movie wasn't just for the fanboys. The wisest decision that 20th Century Fox and Marvel made was to make these characters as accessible to those outside of the world of comics as possible, but at the same time not making such drastic changes so as to alienate your core fan base. All of this was achieved with the story for \\"X-Men\\" and as I said a moment ago, it served as the perfect jumping point for this series to expand from.    Bringing the film to life was director Bryan Singer, who with this movie brought to comic book films something that had been noticeably absent for many years...a semi-grounded sense of reality not too dissimilar from our own (apart from the whole super-powered thing mind you). Previous to this film (and for that matter the first \\"Blade\\" film), the only truly successful comic book movies were those in the initial Batman franchise, and in each of those movies we found a very eccentric, gothic-inspired reality that was more outlandish and showy. For me I appreciated the fact that Bryan chose to steep these films in a reality that was much more recognizable to our own rather than one much more fantastic. By doing this we are able to better relate to the characters, and therefore become immersed in the story, allowing for a much easier suspension of our disbelief (which every fantasy and/or sci-fi film relies upon).    Besides the look and feel of the film, Bryan also excelled in creating some really fun, entertaining action sequences that at times felt like they were the very panels of a comic book coming to life. As a fan of comic books and some of the comic book films that had come prior to this film's release, I was pleased to watch an adaptation that knew how to blend the action elements together with intriguing character development. Generally these types of films had been written off as no more than summer fluff at the box office, and nine times out of ten this had been proven true. Not since 1989's \\"Batman\\" (to my recollection) had a comic book movie effectively blended those two all-important elements together to such a great degree of success. So, for this adaptation to buck the established order of things (so to speak), and actually include a coherent story rife with interesting characters along with the obvious entertainment factor inherent in most visual effects movies was a bit unheard of. Thankfully, Bryan Singer and his writer David Hayter, along with everyone else involved in the decision making behind the scenes of \\"X-Men\\" were smart enough to create a film that stayed somewhat true to the notion that this was a summer blockbuster, but also a movie that contained some great drama and could please audiences for years to come beyond its stay at the box office.    Starring in this film is quite the varied group of talented actors and actresses ranging from veterans of both stage and screen, such as Sir Ian McKellan (\\"Apt Pupil\\") and Patrick Stewart (\\"Star Trek: Nemesis\\"), to some of Hollywood's great beauties like Famke Janssen (\\"Taken\\") and Halle Berry (\\"Swordfish\\") to relative new faces like Anna Paquin (\\"Fly Away Home\\") and Hugh Jackman (\\"Someone Like You\\"). What was great about this cast is that each member brought a seriousness to the role and portrayed these comic book characters as if they were any other dramatic role, opting not to play up the camp factor that would have been the order of the day in previous years past (for example the much maligned \\"Batman & Robin\\"). For a majority of the actors and actresses chosen for the various mutants, and humans for that matter, the casting appeared to be strokes of genius and good fortune combined, as each one looked as if they had manifested directly from the comic book page.    Perhaps the biggest surprise casting choice, for me at least, would be a then unknown Hugh Jackman as the fan favorite Wolverine. Having not seen Jackman in anything prior to this film I wasn't sure if he could do justice to the clawed hero; however, I was completely blown away by the intensity and ferocity that Jackman brought to the role. His portrayal is so spot-on that it reached the point that his interpretation became almost universally accepted by the comic book fan community as being the one true Wolverine. A move that is surprising given that this community is generally extremely finicky about sticking to the details of their beloved heroes, not to mention the fact that Jackman is over 6' tall, lean, yet still muscular rather than being a short, and semi-stocky, but extremely muscular guy that would more closely resemble his comic book counterpart. With that knowledge one could see how surprising it is that his portrayal was so easily accepted, but I guess when it's clear that he's the ideal person for the role, some details can be overlooked for the greater good of the franchise.    \\"X-Men\\" was a very well written, directed, and acted movie that gave comic book fans and audiences in general something that everyone could enjoy. For comic book fans there were some minor gripes about changes made to some of the characters origins, but nothing significant enough to take away from how great this movie was, or what it would mean for other comic book characters being brought to life on the big screen. Even after all the comic book movies that have bowed since this film's opening, \\"X-Men\\" still remains one of my all-time favorites of the genre, a fact that I don't see changing anytime in the near future.    \\"X-Men\\" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.
1428156585|5.0|I read this book a couple years ago and still think about it.  I used to have a typical American liberal pluralistic view of cultures: \\"all cultures are valuable and their differences should be respected and protected.\\"  NO MORE! Infidel clearly illustrates superior and inferior cultures.  Sure, every culture contains good and bad, but now I see that some have more bad and some have more good.  Instead of applauding every culture uncritically, now I am bold to look for both the good and evil in every culture including my own and work for positive evolution.      Ms Ali is a courageous woman whose story makes all of us better for the telling . . . but I can't help but be sad that she doesn't have a warm or trusting relationship with God.     I listened to this book on CD. At first, her accent required extra energy and concentration to understand, but after about an hour I had no problem and really appreciated hearing her story in her own voice.

0887431461|3.0|I was using the Everything for early education PreK book before this. My daughter has outgrown that one so I bought this to help her with the next level and I'm honestly not very impressed with the book. A big drawback for me is all the color. I like to be able to make copies of the handwriting pages and print them out. Kids are going to need to practice writing their letters and numbers more than one time to master the skill. I can't do that with this book because it is in color. Browsing through it I also saw several pages we will have to skip because the instructions or layout of all the colorful pictures will be confusing. Its not a bad book but not really what I need or want. I do like the kindergarten scholar section in the back to prep them for 1st. We will probably use that more. I also think its a waste of pages to include the answers. Kindergarten age children will most likley be doing this with an adult and adults shouldn't need an answer key to these activities.

B0017MO10U|4.0|The ending of the \\"Stargate SG-1\\" TV show left some threads dangling -- the last Goa'uld System Lord was still in hiding, and the Ori were still threatening the world.<br /><br />Fortunately the Goa'uld plot threads are more or less tied up in \\"Stargate: Continuum,\\" the second of the two Stargate direct-to-DVD movies. This movie is a bit of a mind-bender (especially with all the time-skipping and temporal wrinkles) but it brings back all the favorite characters (and some dead ones) and finishes the story off in true Stargate style.<br /><br />SG-1 and General Jack O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) are watching the execution and extraction of Ba'al... but unfortunately, it's not the real Ba'al. The real Ba'al has time-traveled and altered the timeline, causing Teal'c (Christopher Judge), Vala (Claudia Black) and the Tok'ra to vanish, and resulting in Jack's death.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this alternate timeline becomes more perilous after a year -- Earth is being threatened by the supreme System Lord Ba'al, his queen Qetesh (in Vala's body) and his First Prime Teal'c. But when Qetesh and Ba'al clash over his past on Earth, the altered SG-1 must band together to find and destroy Ba'al's time machine, and somehow restore the timeline to what it once was. Or to something resembling it.<br /><br />\\"Stargate: The Ark of Truth\\" and \\"Stargate: Continuum\\" are basically intended to wrap up loose ends, and as a standalone story \\"Stargate Continuum\\" is not quite as satisfying as the television show was. And frankly, \\"Continuum\\" may need multiple viewings to keep up with the time-bouncing plotline -- it scrambled my brain on the first time.<br /><br />But as a finale, it serves the Goa'uld storyline well -- lots of action, space battles, \\"snakeheads,\\" and a way bigger budget that a TV episode would ever have allowed. And it has everything that you'd expect from \\"Stargate SG-1\\" -- icy strandings, some recurring characters (Apophis!), and alien nasties with overwhelming power. There's less of a moral dilemma here, but it's still pretty good.<br /><br />It also has excellent scripting: plot threads drawn from the TV series, witty dialogue (\\"That is, after all, why we've come. Why we had to endure all of that singing. Get rid of the last bad guy and then there's cake\\"), and some nice quiet moments, such as Teal'c talking with Tomin about their bloodstained pasts. And they manage to throw some interesting twists at the audience, such as a shocking revelation about the Ori.<br /><br />And seeing the actors as their SG-1 characters is like putting on a comfortable old shoe. Amanda Tapping and Michael Shanks are suitably brilliant and courageous, and Ben Browder gets to shine as a strong, slightly quirky soldier. Meanwhile, both Christopher Judge and Claudia Black are impressive as their \\"alternate timeline\\" selves who are still part of the Goa'uld empire.<br /><br />And of course, Richard Dean Anderson utterly steals the show whenever he appears (\\"Hey, have you ever tried to find a bathroom in a pyramid?\\") and this is the last appearance of Don S.

But any animation film buff will find it interesting; and actually the book is very interesting for all.  The author has an easy-going style, and he is quite entertaining.<br /><br />The book is grouped into general topics, but due to the nature of these being class notes, there is some repetition of some of the subjects, and it isn't designed as a complete course coverage of \\"how to be an animation artist\\" but rather \\"OK this week we are going to talk about lighting.\\" There are a lot of interesting things mentioned about what made Disney animation films groundbreaking.  One nice thing about the random nature of the book; you can just pick it up and jump around in it; read a few pages here, then some pages there.<br /><br />Just a warning; of the hundreds of sketches included, a few of them the artist forgot to sketch clothes on the person being sketched.

B0019LY5IM|5.0|It's the beginning of the end for \\"Lost\\" -- only one more season to go, and plenty of strange destined events yet to be explained.<br /><br />And \\"Lost: The Complete Fifth Season\\" may be the best season of the show yet, with some unexpected glimpses back into the Island's history, mysterious people, and more explorations of the mysterious Jacob. It feels like the entire season is packed with strange twists and unexpected turns, complete with a trip back in time that illuminates everything that has come before it.<br /><br />Jack joins forces with his former enemy Ben, trying to bring the Oceanic Six back together and get them back to the Island. But Charles Widmore has been sending assassins to kill Hurley and Sayid, and someone is sniffing around Kate's relationship to Aaron. Their only hope of getting back to the Island is to follow the instructions of Eloise Hawking, a woman who has intricate knowledge of time and space -- and the Island.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the Island is randomly leaping through time, flinging Sawyer, Juliet, Daniel, Charlotte and all the others from one time period to another. And when the Oceanic Six (minus a few) arrive on the Island again, they find that it is now 1977 -- Sawyer, Juliet and their friends have all been living there for the past three years, as part of the Dharma Initiative. Sun and Ben end up in the hands of the remaining Others -- along with a supposedly dead man now returned to life.<br /><br />But as the fateful Incident approaches, Jack and Co. end up having their plans unravel around them, and a bunch of gun-toting Dharma people out for their blood. With the help of Daniel Faraday and his mysterious journal, the splintered little group sets out to somehow reset everything that has happened on the Island -- even as Ben and the Others approach an ancient monument, where the Island's fate will be changed forever.<br /><br />There's a sense of melancholy in the fifth season of \\"Lost.\\" Okay, it's never been a cheerful show, but it's clear that many of the plot threads are being wound together, and the characters that are killed have wrenchingly tragic send-offs. What's more, this short season reveals a whole lot more about the Island than we ever knew before -- the stone foot, the Incident, Eloise Hawking's knowledge about time, and the Island's mysterious ruler Jacob.<br /><br />And it's packed solid with plot, full of twists, gory action, flashbacks, flashforwards, and a sense of supernatural suspense. The first half of the season is all about the Six slowly being drawn back to the Island (almost against their will, really) while the second is about the disasters that ensue because of their presence, and the fight against the inevitability of time. It's just a big thick rope of plot twists that tightens itself as it approaches the explosive finale.<br /><br />Fortunately this season is also graced with exceptionally good dialogue, and some funny moments often supplied by the ever-lovable Hurley (example: writing down the \\"Empire Strikes Back\\" script from memory). And it evolves into straight-out science fiction after sort of flirting with it for the past few seasons.<br /><br />Matthew Fox does a pretty good job as the increasingly irrational, obsessed Jack, but he's overshadowed by Josh Holloway. Holloway is pretty darn brilliant as the new alpha male in the jungle who suddenly has his peaceful domain disrupted. Michael Emerson is also excellent as the vaguely creepy Ben, whose frustrations and anger start boiling over as he tries to somehow fix whatever has gone wrong, only to make a terrible mistake.<br /><br />Actually, most of the cast does an excellent job: Naveen Andrews, Elizabeth Mitchell (especially in the finale), the dry-witted Ken Leung, Jeremy Davies, Yunjin Kim, Daniel Dae Kim, and the ever-awesome Jorge Garcia. There are also some other incredible actors who become pretty prominent here, including François Chau, Zuleikha Robinson, the ageless Nestor Carbonell, and the mysterious Fionnula Flanagan.<br /><br />And Mark Pellegrino is introduced as the mysterious Jacob, whose identity, nature and goals are all murky. You're left wondering who this guy is, and if we'll see him again.<br /><br />\\"Lost: The Complete Fifth Season\\" is a tightly-written, intensely-plotted stream of bittersweet sci-fi, and it leaves you hungry for whatever is next.

B0019LY5IM|5.0|Season Five of LOST was the first that provided more answers than questions.  The first four seasons had raised questions at an extraordinary pace, providing the occasional answer.  But while the end of Season Five raised a couple of massive questions of huge cliffhanger proportions, we nonetheless got more of a sense of what is going on with the island, its inhabitants, and its visitors than ever before.  There are still some major unanswered questions, like the origin of the island and what the deal with Richard Alpert (the ageless wonder) is and who built the statue (and what brought it down), but we still are getting an overall picture of things.<br /><br />What held true of LOST after Season One holds true of the show after Season Five:  whether this turns out to be a great show depends on how well they manage to wrap up the overall story line.  There have been very, very few shows in the history of television that have set out, from the very beginning, to tell a self-contained story with a beginning, middle, and an end.  BATTLESTAR GALACTICA (the new one, not the old one) was one.  BABYLON 5 was another.  Many other shows have more or less ended up telling a story, but in a way that wasn't crucial to the structure of the series.  This was even true of a show like ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT.  But for shows like LOST and BSG, our ultimate judgment will hinge on how well all the loose ends are wrapped up at the end.  The final answers will have a retroactive effect on the rest of the series.  If we are left at the end feeling that the secrets of the island have not been adequately answered, this will undercut all that went before.  If we don't accept the way the stories of the characters are resolved, it will weaken the series as a whole.  I loved the way that BSG ended (though I'll grant that not everyone did) and I fully hope that LOST will end similarly well.  We've gotten five great seasons and I doubt that Damon Lindelhof and Carlton Cuse will suddenly lose their ability to tell a great story.  Plus, they will continue to be assisted by some great writers like Drew Goddard and Elizabeth Sarnoff and Brian K. Vaughan (who got a great shout out this season when Hurley is seen reading in Spanish one of the volumes of Y: THE LAST MAN, the famous graphic series written by Vaughan).<br /><br />Season Five began with the survivors of Oceanic 815 and their various allies split into two groups.  The Oceanic Six are back in the real world, but Jack and Ben are determined to lead them all back to the island.  The rest back on the island - at least those that are still alive, most having died - have, like Billy Pilgrim in Kurt Vonnegut's SLAUGHTERHOUSE-FIVE, become unstuck in time.  They find themselves moving from one year or decade - heck, from one century - to another.  And when the Oceanic Six return, they find themselves stranded in a different time themselves, back in the seventies with the Dharma Initiative and the Others.  Most poignantly, Sun has found out that Jin is till alive, but they are stuck thirty years apart.<br /><br />But this wouldn't be LOST without a host of twists and turns.  We are barraged (in a good way) with a never-ending string of shocks and surprises.  Things constantly turn out not to be what we expect.  That is especially true of John Locke, but true of just about everyone else as well.  The amount of detail is almost overwhelming, though in a good way.  It keeps the show fascinating and ever fresh.  And of course, this being LOST, there are a host of deaths.  The only series with a larger body count is BSG.<br /><br />The best thing about Season Five of LOST is that it continues the excellent pacing that was established after the Season Three hiatus.  I'm sure everyone will recall that fans were outraged and disappointed after the first six episodes of Season Three, which were broadcast a few months before the show resumed in the winter.  Fans felt that the show was dragging, as if they were trying to stretch the series out an extra season or two instead of getting on with the story.  When the show resumed, the producers responded to the fans' complaints and significantly stepped up the pace of the storytelling.  By the end of that season it felt like a new and completely refreshed show.  And Seasons Four and Five have maintained that pace.  One thing that definitely helped them maintain the pace was the announcement at the end of Season three that the show would end after Season Six.<br /><br />And so we come to the beginning of the end.  For five seasons LOST has been one of the most intense, involving shows on television.  I'm already starting to get sad about its end.  I still haven't quite recovered from BATTLESTAR GALACTICA ending this spring and now LOST ends next spring.  It has been a great story from the very beginning and we can only hope that things remain just as good as they have been.a season or two instead of getting on with the story.

B00295UBTO|5.0|J.R.R. Tolkien's tales of Middle-Earth weren't restricted just to fantasy epic \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" His life's work was spread over hundreds of stories and invented legends -- some were compiled into \\"The Silmarillion.\\"<br /><br />But some were left over -- yes, there were even more stories that didn't make the cut.

B00006G8HX|5.0|Contrary to popular opinion, The Search for Spock is just as good as The Wrath of Khan.  Like TWOK, The Search for Spock has an awesome villain.  The villain, Klingon Commander Kruge, is played by Christopher Lloyd.  With a villain played by Lloyd, you can't go wrong.  In my opinion, Christopher Lloyd played the best Klingon.  No other actor comes close to surpassing Lloyd's portrayal of a Klingon.    The Genesis Device plot saved Star Trek.  In this movie, the Genesis Device was the perfect way to bring Spock from the dead.  The writers were very lucky to have it turn out this way.  As a result, the resurrection of Spock is very believable.  To steal a quote from Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, \\"Genesis was perfectly named-- the creation of life, not death\\".    This movie works because it shows how much the crew risked to save Spock.  They disobeyed Starfleet by stealing the Enterprise and returning to the Genesis planet.  The movie clearly shows that the needs of the one outweigh the needs of the many.
B001GCUNYO|5.0|TAKEN<br /><br />**** ½ Out of 5<br /><br />Release Date- February 27th, 2008 (France) January 30th, 2009 (USA)<br /><br />Running Time- 93-Minutes<br /><br />Rating- PG-13<br /><br />Screenplay- Luc Besson & Robert Mark Kamen<br /><br />Director- Pierre Morel<br /><br />Starring- Liam Neeson, Maggie Grace, Xander Berkeley, Oliver Rabourdin, Katie Cassidy and Famke Janssen<br /><br />Upon seeing the preview for Taken I was quite interested in seeing this flick I came across the abduction scene when flipping through the stations and it got me hooked and I found it quite intense and was very much looking forward to this movie. In recent years the action genre has really gone downhill. And even action flicks made outside of Hollywood feel as if they were made by Hollywood. Taken does sort of feel like that at times, but this is the type of movie Hollywood once made when the produced quality movies.<br /><br />Taken isn't the most original movie ever made and you've seen variations of the plot done many, many times and maybe it's just me, but Taken also sort of had a feel of the TV series 24 in tone and in some of the scenes and in the main character. As much as it is an action movie Taken is also a suspense flick and both these elements work very well.<br /><br />The screenplay by Luc Besson & Robert Mark Kamen was well written, but not without its flaws. The lead character Bryan Mills played by Liam Neeson is a former CIA agent and due to that he has connections that allow him to track down the people who abducted his daughter, but the problem I had is things come a little too easy. Bryan gets a little too much done too easy and certain aspects of the plot aren't developed enough, but despite that Besson and Kamen do a solid job. Bryan Mills is the main character and really the only character that truly matters.<br /><br />And Besson and Kamen do a bang up job with the character. He's well developed and is a take no prisoners kick butt character. The rest of the characters are just sort of there and not given a whole lot to do, but in no way does this hurt the movie. Luc Besson has made some movies under Hollywood, but most of his flicks are French productions, but clearly geared at American audiences, but his movies are just a whole lot of fun. They might have a Hollywood feel, but they work better than most of the junk coming out of Hollywood these days. Robert Mark Kamen best known for the first three Karate Kid movies often works with Besson and both these guys work very well together. In general you may not get a cinematic masterpiece, but you do get your money's worth and Taken is by far their best work to date as writing partners (and possibly even on their own).<br /><br />Director Pierre Morel does a solid job even if sort of by the books. The pacing is solid and early on it moves slowly, but steady and is interesting and none of the scenes feel like fillers. The action sequences are highly enjoyable even if they lack some originality. Quite a few times I couldn't help, but think of 24, which I suppose is more due to the script, but some of the scenes feel like something done on 24. But despite some lack of originality, Morel does an excellent job and shows some potential as a filmmaker. Taken is well made and moves at a very nice pace and always remains interesting. Even if the action scenes lack originality at times they are again highly enjoyable and there are some scenes that are highly suspenseful. Also don't let the PG-13 rating scare you off. A lot has changed in cinema and movies that would once be R-rated get away<br /><br />What really elevates Taken is the performance by Liam Neeson; Neeson is one of the most talented actors of his generation and is one of the few actors that can pull off any role and do it great. Here as Bryan Mills he delivers one of the best if not the best performance of his career and is without a doubt one of my personal favorite performances of 2008. Anytime I write a review for an action flick I always mention how the action stars out there now really leave a lot to be desired. Gone are the Stallone's and McQueen's of the action genre. Liam Neeson though makes for the perfect action star; he has the no nonsense persona done perfectly and is also a great actor. While there are many actors who have done action flicks and gave excellent performances most of the time it isn't about the actual performance, but Neeson plays the tough guy role perfectly and also delivers one hell of a performance.<br /><br />Maggie Grace as Kim gives a slightly awkward performance; I haven't seen a lot of her work outside of The Fog, which was simply a put a pathetic waste of time, but I thought Maggie did well with horrible material and showed some potential. At the time this movie was made I guess she was about 23 maybe and she just didn't fit playing a 17-year old girl and actually the character comes off a lot younger than 17. It's very common for actors in their mid 20s and in some cases late 20s too play teenagers and some pull it off and some don't. Maggie Grace doesn't deliver a bad performance per se, but slightly awkward. Again she wasn't bad, but just didn't fit the age of the character and came across younger than 17, but some of that is more on the writing and directing, but again it was just awkward.<br /><br />Famke Janssen, Xander Berkeley and Oliver Rabourdin are solid in small, but vital roles and Katie Cassidy was good, but not given a whole lot to do. All the performances are mostly solid, but like I stated before its Liam Neeson that takes center stage here and really elevates Taken. Without Neeson, Taken would have been an enjoyable flick, but Neeson takes the material and makes far more out of it.<br /><br />Overall Taken is a solid movie that just slightly falls short of being brilliance, but when all is said and done the movie works on pretty much every level and again I have to state it's Neeson that really elevates the movie.<br /><br />The Blu-ray release is quite solid in terms of picture and sound; the action sequences sound amazing and the picture is sharp.

1416914307|5.0|I LOVE The mortal instruments series!!!!!! I simply couldnt WAIT for City of Glass to come out over here in the UK so i ordered it form the US and no dissapointments!

1400082773|5.0|Dreams from My Father, by Barack Obama, is great. I started reading the book so I could learn more about our president, which I did. Especially, I know more about Obama's early life. For example I never knew that he spent some of his childhood in Indonesia. I also think that the way Barack Obama wrote this book is so personal I could imagine him speaking as I read. At the end of the book was part of Barack Obama's other book, The Audacity of Hope, which I want to read (because I really enjoyed this book). I recommend this book to people that have any interest in Barack Obama, whether you're democratic or republican. I would say that the youngest age to be reading this book is a 13 year old, because some of the material is difficult. This book reminds me of Crossing Jordan. I would compare Dreams from My Father to Crossing Jordan because they both deal with people growing up and dealing with racial issues in America.  This book is about Barack Obama's life and it's different stages. He grew up with his mom and grandparents, and had a very vague image of his father. As he grows up, goes to college, moves to Chicago to be a community organizer, he learns more about his family, and about his father. This book takes place in the last half of the 20th century (roughly between 1960's and the 1990's). This book doesn't take place in just one place; it follows Obama's travels, from Hawaii to Indonesia to Los Angeles to New York to Chicago and to Kenya. Barack Obama is the main character in this memoir. He's a tall, skinny and black man. He is very intelligent; he went to Harvard Law School and was president of the Law Review.    Barack Obama's conflict had a lot to do with his father's presence in his life. Barack's dad left his mom right after he was born, so he grew up without a father. His father's absence led to Barack's internal conflict and confusion about his origins and race. Once when Barack was still in elementary school his father came to Hawaii to visit him and his mom and his grandparents. This sudden appearance of his father seemed to disrupt Barack's image of himself and his family. After his father left again for Kenya, Barack barely made any contact with him. All he knew was as much as his mom would tell him. As Barack grew up his knowledge of who he is grew too, but there were still questions left unanswered. Barack is in his first years of college in L.A. He's in a café near the college when he has a conversation with an acquaintance of his.    \\"Barack.\\"  \\"I though your name was Barry.\\"  \\"Barack's my given name. My father's name. He was Kenyan.\\"  \\"Does it mean something?\\"  \\" It means `Blessed'. In Arabic. My grandfather was a Muslim.\\"  Regina repeated the name to herself, testing out the sound.   \\"Barack. It's beautiful.\\" She leaned forward across the table. \\"So why does everybody call you Barry?\\"  \\"Habit, I guess. My father used it when he arrived in the States. I don't know whether that was his idea or somebody else's. He probably used Barry because it was easier to pronounce. You know- helped him fit in. Then it got passed on to me. So I could fit in.\\"  \\"Do you mind if I called you Barack?\\"  I smiled. \\"Not as long as you say it right.\\"   Barack's nickname Barry was used by his father and himself to assimilate into the American culture. He's stuck between two cultures. He chooses between Barack, which his Kenyan father's name, or if he should use Barry, a name that wouldn't stick out much in America. Since his mother was American and his father was African this caused Barack to be confused about his own race.
B001AVEJ1Y|1.0|What happened to Star Trek?  For the first 20 years, the franchise was excellent.  From 1966-1986, Star Trek expressed Roddenberry's ideals and belief in a better future.  He combined morals with adventure to create a truly unique series.    Fast forward a couple of decades and things have changed.  People want less dialogue and character development and more action.  The ADD generation has prompted Paramount to produce a movie that is nothing like the original television series.  The popularity of this movie is a testament to the fact that today's society is action oriented.  Star Trek is alive but at what cost?
0440241901|4.0|I wasn't expecting much from this novel, I just read it because it was there and I didn't have anything else going at the time.  But it  was such a fun book, I'm going to check out some more of Sophie Kinsella's novels.  The characters were real, with funny circumstances that actually made me laugh out loud. It was very Bridget Jones Diary-ish, or how I imagine it to be as I haven't read it.
B00004RJ74|4.0|From Dusk Till Dawn (Dimension Collector's Series) - I saw Dusk Till Dawn with my wife and boys and knew I had made an error taking them to see it as this was not a film for kids. I should have watched it alone. I knew nothing about it until my boys asked to go see it and I wouldn't recommend it for really young audiences.<br /><br />It was chock a block full of dark murderous themes, and excellent special effects but I think it provided almost too many effects. I consider it a good film which was entertaining almost until the ending.  I just question the need for the exceptional magnitude of explicit screen violence.
0756404746|5.0|The Name of the Wind is an extremely well written novel.  I was completely amazed that this was a debut novel.  The story is not the most exciting or fast paced, but Patrick more than makes up for it with his amazing storytelling abilities.  Kvothe is an amazing character and is written in such a way that I felt a bond with him by the end of the book.  I was so sad to finish this book with realization that the second installment is not yet available.  I can't wait to see what the future holds for this great new author.
B0000AUHOH|3.0|...it's good even when it's bad.  As a result, I believe The Final Frontier is severely underrated.  There are many flaws with this movie.  First, Klingon Commander Klaa is an extremely weak nemesis with equally weak motives.  Most of the time, he just comes off as cheesy.  Also, the ending is a major let down.  But one must remember that Shatner didn't have the budget to have rock-like creatures attack him.    Even though the special effects are awful, TFF more than makes up for it by having great character interaction.  TFF gives ample screen time to Scotty, Sulu, Chekov, and Uhura (even though some of it was cheesy).  But most importantly, the movie focused on the Kirk-Spock-McCoy triad.  This movie shows the best Kirk-Spock-McCoy interaction of any Star Trek movie.  The 2009 Star Trek movie clearly lacked this essential element.
B00006FDCD|2.0|Where the book IT was brutal and unflinching the made-for-TV movie is soft and hokey.  In the age of remakes I often wonder why this amazing story hasn't seen a proper release.    I really didn't have a problem with the children in this adaptation, even though a lot of the stories and gore were omitted, the language was also made squeaky clean but what do you expect, it's made-for-TV.  I absolutely hated the adults in this, I don't know if I would feel the same way had I seen it when it first aired... but it is very dated.  The acting is atrocious for both the kids and adults, but I can forgive the kids.  If you thought the bizarre ending of the book didn't fit, well it fits even worse here.  Overall most of the story is lost, mostly everything that makes the book such a great read is not present here.  My suggestion is skip this and just read the book again.    My other suggestion is for someone to get on making IT into a proper film.  Two or three movies, around two and a half hours each, c'mon and do it King.
B0000B1OE7|5.0|Always has been a great movie. It seems the 10th anniversary edition is a little edited in areas the original was not. I wish I hadn't spent extra for this version. I bought it used and there appeared to be a booklet missing also. No biggie. The best anime ever! It seems Hollywood has been flirting with the idea, but I hope they finally make the live action version.
B000006ZDR|5.0|I'll start by saying that \\"Slipping Away\\" is, in my opinion, better than \\"Over and Over\\".  The latter song is a cool, slow Sabbath classic but, \\"Slipping Away\\" is one of those faster tunes that the Sabs churn out.  The dueling guitar with the bass in the middle comes out great.  Then you have Ronnie James spittin' out his lyrics.  I would have to say that I am in the minority for \\"Slipping Away\\" but, It's all subjective I guess.  Now, check it out.  We now move into the really good stuff.  I first heard MOB RULES a few years after it came out.  About 1983.  I owned the HOLY DIVER tape and a friend let me borrow MOB RULES and I totally devoured it.  I was 11 years old and at the time, this was an early exposure to Black Sabbath.  I had heard some of the classic songs but, I didn't hear the Ozzy material so much that I fell in love with the older stuff like most people have.  Ozzy was a great singer for Sabbath.  No doubt about it.  The Ozzy-era Sabbath cannot be touched but, the Dio-ear Sabbath must not be ignored.  To this day I hold Ozzy and Dio as equals when it comes to Sabbath.  There is more original Ozzy tunes but, with the albums that Dio has made with the boys, they are just as good and just as ground-breaking as the older stuff.  MOB RULES is a absolute favorite of mine.  I've been listening to this album for almost 30 years now and never grow tired of it.  \\"Turn up the Night\\" is a great opener and is akin to \\"Neon Knights\\" off of HEAVEN AND HELL.  \\"Voodoo\\" has a great and memorable riff and the mysticsm of Dio.  Then we have \\"The Sign of the Southern Cross\\".  OK, I'll say it, this one of my favorite Black Sabbath songs ever.  One of the greatest guitar riffs that Tony Iommi has conjured up.  This song is heavy and deep with a lovely acoustic intro that makes you feel like you fall into the abyss when the real music starts.  MOB RULES has one of the best guitar tones ever in the history of heavy metal and it is evident on this classic song.  \\"E5150\\" is, atthe time, a current version of one of those acoustic or \\"Supertzar\\" type of interludes that the Sabs do on just about every album.  \\"E5150 is definitley one of the most sinister.  Very evil sounding and the ending guitar line is pure magic that flows into the title track, \\"The Mob Rules\\".  This is pure, high octane Black Sabbath in it's most primitive form.  Be careful, you might get scared!  I've always thought that \\"Country Girl\\" was a good one too.  Another of Iommi's great riffs.  \\"Falling off the Edge of the World\\" sounds just like the title.  That's how this song makes you feel when you hear it.  As far as everyone's performance on this album is they are awesome.  As I have mentioned before, Some of Tony Iommi's best work is on this record and his tone is to die for.  Geezer Butler plays his bass with extreme precision and pumps you into submission.  As always, Ronnie James Dio is very good and this is one of the best albums that he has ever been involed in.  One of the last and most important ingredients to this now, ultimate metal classic is Vinny Appice.  I like heavy sounding drums and Vinny is the man to do it.  Vinny is very different from Bill Ward.  Bill is more of a jazz type drummer who is very responsible for the classic Sabbath sound.  Vinny is more of a player that keeps it in the pocket.  It's kind of like comparing Clive Burr to Nicki McBrain from Iron Maiden.  Both are very good but in different ways.  Vinny comes across like a monster behind the drum kit and the way they were recorded was massive.  When you throw all these elements together, you have MOB RULES.  One of the greatest heavy metal albums of all time.  Every song is good.  In my opinion, there is'nt a bum track on here.  If you are interested in hearing what the definition of real heavy metal is, I highly recommend MOB RULES.
B001DTPZNY|1.0|This is literally one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  Save yourself and do not watch this movie!  I can't believe that George Lucas ruined Star Wars and Indiana Jones within a 9 year period (1999-2008).

I feel like the conversations between Rosie and Ruby are totally pointless and not funny. The only interesting ones (as someone else stated) are the ones between Alex and Rosie. I feel like this has been dragged out so long, and I'm still not finished. I also don't understand who writes such long emails with just complaining about EVERYTHING. It's boring. I'm about to just turn to the end and finish it before I die of boredom. I'm only finishing it because I actually spent money on it!
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|We went to see the new Star Trek movie last night and it was wonderful. All but the most Die Hard Trekker will relish what JJ Abrams and company have done to relaunch the Franchise. The film was fun and as Scotty said \\"Exciting\\".    I was surprised that unlike the premiere of Star Wars Episode III there were no long lines and no geeks dressed up in costume. I was expecting as many folks dressed in their pointy ears as there were dressed in Darth Vader breath masks at the Revenge of the Sith premiere but alas there was nary a Vulcan to be seen. Trek has always seemed to have attracted the more Cerebral Nerd.    I greatly enjoyed the film. I cried when Kirk was born and became misty eyed when we first see the Enterprise. Many things have changed from the original series and the original movies I-VI but overall they are changes for the better and there is (dare I say it?) a logical explanation for what has changed.    The basic premise of the Film much like that of Abrams' LOST is Destiny. Certain people have a Destiny to fulfill and no matter what happen they will fulfill it. Chris Pine's James T. Kirk is a man of Destiny. A renegade Romulan goes back in time and changes history. Kirk no longer grows up with his Starship Captain father and his brother Sam is never born. Jim becomes a juvenile delinquent Iowa farmboy and save for a chance meeting with Captain Pike after a bar fight (over a pretty Swahili speaking linguist) would have never joined Star Fleet Academy.    Pine's Kirk is far less self centered to me than Shatner's. He does not try to channel Shatner at all (he doesn't even lose his shirt!) unlike the other actors who do a fair homage to their predecessor. Pine's Kirk is a man of determination willing to do whatever is necessary to succeed. The first time he meets Spock is at an inquiry board at the Academy where he had hacked a computer program Spock wrote to overcome an unwinnable situation boldly declaring he did not believe in the unwinnable task.    Pine's Kirk though new and bold is still the same Captain that we've always loved. This Kirk does have a tendency to get his butt kicked more than the old one and spends a lot of time on his back. But he's still the ladies man, still the loyal friend, still the natural tactician and natural leader. It is great fun to see the beginning of the friendship between Kirk, Bones, and Spock.    The acting is first rate. Zachary Quinto is spot on as Spock even having some of Leonard Nimoy's mannerisms. The scene between the two of them is done very well. I believe that due to the change in continuity Quinto's Spock will be more 'Human'. He and Pine's Kirk have great chemistry together though at first they do not get along.    Karl Urban is excellent as Leonard \\"Bones\\" McCoy and the Kiwi actor even sounds a bit like Deforest Kelly. Zoe Saldana upgrades Uhuru from the hip Sixties chick created by Nichelle Nichols to a hipper 21st Century woman who is no nonsense and gets her man in the end (though who was a Big Surprise).     Sulu and Chekov both have some great scenes and Simon Pegg's Scotty steals every scene he is in (yes his engines kinna take maximum warp Captain). Bruce Greenwood is also very good in the Captain Pike role originated by Jeffrey Hunter though with the changes in the continuity brought on by the Romulans I doubt he ever dances with the Orion Slave Girl on Talos IV.    I look forward to seeing this one again and again. I know there will have to be a sequek including Klingons or perhaps a new version of Khan since he and Kirk have not met yet. I can't wait. (Leave V'ger and the Borg in the Barn JJ!)    I think the turn away from The Next Generation and back to the origins of the original crew of the Starship Enterprise will with the demise of Star Wars via the horrible prequels will make the Trek franchise the scifi vehicle of a New Generation of Fans.
B00005JKHP|5.0|Star Trek The Motion Picture is unjustly underrated.  Apparently, the ADD generation doesn't like the exploration of space and the human condition.  TMP is Gene Roddenberry's vision of Star Trek and it is truly amazing.  Years later, Star Trek degenerated into junk because it strayed away from Roddenberry's vision.    The Director's Cut is definitely the version to get because TMP was rushed to theaters to make the scheduled opening day.  If I remember correctly, the movie reels were shipped to movie theaters wet!  22 years later, Robert Wise was given the opportunity to finally \\"finish\\" the film.  The result is an even better movie.    After seeing Star Trek (2009), this movie is more amazing than ever.
B000001DTM|5.0|Some of the early 90's music I loved sounds horribly cheesy and dated now.  But not the case at all with U2.  I really think they've always been ahead of their time and in my opinion this is one of their very best CDs.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|This is only my first or second review I've written ever, but I was so thoroughly impressed with this production that I had to write a review (maybe I'll start writing more!).  I didn't read any other reviews so my review isn't swayed by others.    I have never been a big fan of Meryl Streep as an actress, not because she wasn't good, but probably only because of the types of roles and types of movies she typically acts in.  Her performance in not only the movie, but in particular, \\"The Winner Takes It All,\\" is simply magnificent.  I am not a professional singer nor do I have any background that would make me a knowledgeable voice critic, but I have listened to a lot of music and I have quite frankly never heard a performance quite as powerful and beautiful as hers in this track.  That is a professional singing performance if I have ever heard one, and I could listen to that song over and over again (and I do).  She is wonderful throughout the soundtrack, in particular this song, but check out the phrase from track time 3:50 through 4:35 which peaks at an incredible demonstration at 4:21.  I have a newly found admiration for Meryl Streep (maybe should have been there before, but now is for good).    As for the rest of the album, in general, I was skeptical that I needed it or wanted it, having most of the original songs (key word being \\"most\\").  It was settled when I heard \\"Slipping Through My Fingers\\" in the movie, which I hadn't heard before even by ABBA.  I had to have that beautiful song, and once again Meryl Streep performed wonderfully along with Amanda Seyfried, though you don't get a good sample of Amanda from this track.  The orchestration is wonderful is this song.  So that was the impetus for getting the album, but I continued to be pleasantly surprised by the entire album: of course the music is great as written and performed by ABBA, but this album has slight differences in orchestration, keys (for instance Slipping Through My Fingers is in D, whereas the original is in F, I think!), and a definite \\"acting\\" slant where you can hear the emotion of the story that is behind the music.  As a result, the album seems like a completely new addition to my music collection: a double bonus in this case where you love the songs already ... it's not that often that you can enjoy different versions in different ways.    Amanda Seyfried is also wonderful throughout, particularly in Honey, Honey (fun), The Name of the Game, and the hidden \\"tracks\\", I Have a Dream and Thank You For the Music.  She also seems like she could easily be a professional singer, although she did not have a powerful song/performance like Meryl Streep in  The Winner Takes It All.    I was also unfamiliar with \\"Our Last Summer\\" where the men did a fine job and a great song.  I was not particularly impressed by any of the men though I don't believe the jist was for power or strength in the context of the movie.  In particular, Pierce Brosnan seemed like an actor more than a singer (he would probably agree?), but I think he came into his own in another song I was unfamiliar with, \\"When All Is Said And Done\\", another beautiful song.    This album is something I recommend for anyone who loves touching and sometimes powerful music, even if you are not generally interested in broadway or soundtrack recordings.  This is one of those albums that will be listened to over and over for me.
B001E5FYS8|4.0|I vaguely remember the story about the high wire acrobat who walked betweeen the tops of the Twin Towers.  I was only slightly aware of those buildings back then.  Up to that point, the Empire State Building was the tallest structure in my lifetime.  I had long forgotten about this amazing feat until I saw that a video was recently put together about the event.      \\"Man on Wire\\" does a good job of giving the background of Philippe Petite with footage of some of his other traffic-stopping stunts.  We come to understand that Petite can't just waltz into a public (or private) structure, set up his wire and do his thing.  There are laws against such death defying acts (and these certainly fit that descriptive definition).  Thus we also get an in-depth account of the secret plans to elude the authorities in order to enable the event to become a reality.  This part of the film, somewhat lengthy in its' telling, comes across like a Cold War spy movie.  Petite has an interesting cast of co-conspiritors and they each have their opportunity to tell their perspectives and recollections.      Ultimately, the film delivers the amazing footage of a man who takes a stroll in the most incredible circumstances.  I had to hold onto my couch just watching it.  The postscript was a bit long even adding a gratuitous recreation of an amorous encounter with a celebrity groupie.  I guess my \\"4 Star\\" rating is based on the 10-15 minutes that ought to have been editted out of this final copy.  Had that been done this would have been a hard documentary to top.
B000083C49|5.0|The final movie of the so-called \\"Star Trek trilogy\\" wraps up everything nicely.  Kirk and Company are facing serious charges for disobeying Starfleet in the previous movie.  Thankfully for them, they have an opportunity to save the Earth, and in the process, their careers.<br /><br />At the end of the movie, Kirk and Company are treated as heroes and Admiral Kirk is reduced to Captain.  With the rank of Captain, Kirk is given command of the new Enterprise-A.  The heroic actions of Kirk and Company also allowed the name Enterprise to be passed onto future generations.  It is amazing how everything came together in the Star Trek trilogy.<br /><br />Sadly, things went downhill for Star Trek after 1986.  Most of the movie sequels were not satisfying and the numerous spin-offs degraded Star Trek even more.  To steal a quote from Scotty, \\"Hang on lassie, it gets bumpy from here\\".
0767827902|5.0|A great film yet troubling in its apocalyptic message; in the sense that its a haunting reminder of what life really is about.Like the mythical king of corinth whos attempt to capture the powers of the gods ended in his being punished in hell with the hopeless and meaningless task of pushing a rock up a hill to a ledge that does'nt exist! Its interesting to note that the teens neither the adults in the film every express any real desire to attain anything in life. This is the real haunting aspect of the movie. The french philosopher Paul Sartre desribes it as \\"existential suicide\\" where the individual faced with absolute freedom can find no worthwhile endeavor in life to direct it. Beings who are ever faced with \\"nothingness\\" before us.The film is pure Shakespearean tragedy  \\"to be or not to be\\" that is the question!Underneath its actually a film noir.
B001AVEJ1Y|1.0|I have to admit that Im not a fan of Lost or most other JJ Abrahams work. Nevertheless me and my brother being both long time star trek fans went into the cinema with open minds and a lot of excitement.    We were impressed with the special effects and battle scenes. They were especially intense and upto date.    However we left the cinema shaking our heads wondering what they did to our favourite characters and TV show. Here are the reasons in point form:    - Why does Scotty need a Jarjar binks style sidekick? Scotty is a great character on his own. I cringed at the end of the movie when they showed Scotty and his new buddy.    - Spock totally getting it on with Uhura? OMG thats just not right. Spock has always been his own man throughout all of star trek. He is supposed to be the level head for Captain Kirk. Also spock did not have to eject Kirk onto the ice planet..its totally out of character for spock to do something so emotional and dangerous. The spock character was completely wrong.    - Destroying vulcan? Did JJ Abrahams even watch the other earlier trek movies or tv shows? Vulcan is the next most important planet next to earth in the federation.    - Kirks character was completely careless and selfish throughout the whole movie. What makes Kirk great on the TV shows and movies is his humanity and love for his crew and ship. A passionate risk taker..but not a damned fool!    - Nero was a wasted character. Bana is great actor (see the Australian movie called Chopper) who could have brought the needed intensity for the bad guy. But all we get is a handful of dialog and him stabbing someone for no reason.    - Constant steadycam..i was dizzy from all the blasted steadycam that JJ used. He just couldnt keep the camera still for 1 second could he?    So what did we get..we got a shallow, meaningless movie with dumb dialog and nokia product placement. The recycled phrases from old trek movies and weak acting made me sick with disappointment. This could have beenthe best ever trek movie with its huge budget and decent actors but instead JJ murdered and raped it. Sexed up and hyped up he missed the point of what Star Trek is all about..Exploration! Actually it reminded me of another really bad movie.. Lost in Space. They should have named this movie Lost in Trek..or Star TransformersTrek.    Avoid at all costs.

B001NEK2GE|4.0|[[VIDEOID:34378471]]I own the original blue G15 keyboard AND the orange G15 (2007 version) - they're both great keyboards - but the G13 adds a whole new gaming experience and even more advantage.<br /><br />There are G-keys (22) + buttons near the joystick (2) + directions on joystick (4) + pressing down on the joystick (1) = so there's really 29 programmable buttons. And then there's 3 modes so 29 x 3 = 87 programmable keys total.<br /><br />I don't play World of Warcraft, but I am sure many will buy this for that game and get a major advantage. However, I've primarily used this gameboard for FPS such as Crysis and Call of Duty 4.<br /><br />The G4, G10, G11, G12 keys are concave for your finger tips, which is nice, so it basically acts as your WASD area. The G15 key (the first one in the 3rd row) acts like a shift key and the G20 (first key in the 4th row) is shaped like a CTRL key on a standard keyboard. Lastly, the buttons near the joystick would be like a spacebar. However, in the beginning, there is a definitely a slight learning curve to getting used to the feel of this board. The G20 key could have been a bit longer, so it could be pressed easier with the G15 key.<br /><br />I love being able to program the joystick and having it near the G-keys. It's like having a third hand/second mouse in my hand.<br /><br />For Crysis, I programmed the joystick directions to change to the different nanosuit modes instantly (ie: left would enable cloak, right would enable speed); this way I have easy access to change immediately. It's so much faster than using the suit menu or manually pressing the suit toggle key several times. This really makes me feel invincible.<br /><br />It's almost cheating having this controller.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Great for on-the-go without lugging a full-size gaming keyboard<br />- Perfect for gaming on laptops<br />- Great to game by having the controller rest on your thigh if you don't have enough desk space/more comfortable.<br />- Palm grip feels nice<br />- Good amount of weight/metal on the back so it won't slide around.<br />- Joystick<br />- The G4, G10, G11, G12 keys (the middle keys) are concave<br />- Built-in profile memory, so you can take it on another computer and keep your control settings.<br />- The design looks nice<br />- Not just for gaming -- this is a powerful tool for having quick shortcuts.

0792165020|4.0|One advantage in having not is the motivation and desire it breeds to have. But to what cavernous depths may motivation and desire lower someone to fuel inherent megalomania? Would one lie, cheat or steal? The answer is innate. What of murder? I'll never tell.    The film, \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\\" explores such disturbing issues quite demonstratively and effectively. Tom Ripley's (Matt Damon) anguish, is not only to attain wealth and stature, but also the persona and very name attached to both. The opportunity obliges when an affluent New York shipping magnate hires Tom as an emissary to go to a quaint village in Italy and extract his eccentrically wayward son, Dickie Greenleaf, exceptionally played by Jude Law.    The mercenary plan suffers a miscarriage when Tom becomes enthralled by Dickie, siding with him against the elder Greenleaf's intent. Mayhem ensues as these two pseudo \\"mates\\" eventually discover that even when one tosses the perfect salad, no matter what the effort; the oil and vinegar dressing never mixes. The oil is non-polar and consistently rises to the top, while the vinegar is polar and remains at the bottom. Dickie is the oil and Tom is the vinegar.     Despite his crass rendition of \\"My Funny Valentine,\\" Matt Damon handles this complex title role with incredible precision; much like the spontaneous color transitions owned by a chameleon.  His arcane blend of lucidity, psychosis, and guile is pitch-perfect. While Gwyneth Paltrow's (Marge) effort as Dickie's forlorn and jilted girlfriend was yeoman-like, Cate Blanchett (Meredith Logue) and Phillip Seymour Hoffman (Freddie Miles) are both prolific in their diminutive roles.     As for Director Anthony Minghella, this film does not leap off the screen in full spectrum like his brilliant epic, \\"The English Patient,\\" yet he more than manages to purport dire substance to the main theme. In addition, Minghella exhumes colossal efforts from the adept ensemble cast. Under his masterful guidance and classic intuition, the cinematography reminds us of how sublime the southern tip of Italy is, and showcases the sheer elegance of the Mediterranean Coast. Scenes such as the ones where Tom is caught frolicking around in Dickie's clothes, and tears trickling down his face while taking in an opera, which parallels his actions are priceless.     One may not enjoy the dynamics of this sophisticated thriller, feeling that they may be too morally flawed. In order to smooth this doubt over a tad, Minghella himself in an interview stated, `the film is really about myself and how I imagined life in Italy.' He also said, 'it represents the worst of me.' If there is any truth to these statements, Anthony Minghella, though no longer amongst us, at least deserves a shot in the dark.
B001PPLIEG|2.0|I own all bond films and Quantum Solace starts out great but the action does not seem to go through the film all the way.  Quantum Solace I give it a 2.0 - 2.5 out of five star review since the start is great but the end is terible.  So if you are a James Bond fan at least watch it once in case Characters from Quantum Solace that you may have not seen are in the next James Bond film.  I Hope the next James Bond film turns out better than Quantum Solace and hope you find this helpful from a James Bond fan!

B000N6TYLW|4.0|I finally had a chance to watch the last season of The Gilmore Girls and overall it was wonderful!  I really wish it didn't have to end!   However, I was a little disappointed about how they wrapped up some of the characters.  For example - Logan and Rory's breakup.   After all the drama with both Lorelai's breakups and Rory's breakups in the past with other people, this one was a big let down. I also thought that Lane's birth of her twins was completely downplayed.  With all the hoopla and build-up and baby shower, Rory wasn't even written into that episode and there were never even any scenes with the newborn twins.  Did I miss something?  They also seemed to give Babette a lot of scenes, and she was one of my least favorite characters, although I love Sally Struthers.   I also wondered if they knew that this was the last season while they were filming the final few episodes.   I really wanted more tears and emotion - oh well.... I still love and will faithfully watch the re-runs forever!  It is one of my absolutely favorite series!  I wish they would make a movie sequel like they did for Sex in the City.   Of course, with all the original characters, and a big smashing wedding with Lorelai and Luke in the town square.

B001IBIQU6|3.0|This album has the same problem most recent releases by great 80s bands have had (I'm looking at you, Duran Duran) and that is a preponderance of mid-tempo songs. There's pretty much nothing else on here--each song meanders aimlessly; some threaten to become interesting but never quite manage it. \\"Wrong\\" comes the closest, but really it just reminds you of how bland the rest of the album is. I suppose they might be waiting for remixers to turn some of these songs into upbeat dance numbers. If so, that's a shame, because throwing a few quick beats on top does not make a great dance song--and Depeche Mode of all people should know that.

B001U0HBPG|4.0|2008/165 minutes/PG-13 (brief war violence, sexual content, language, smoking)<br /><br />A story about a man born in his 80s and who ages backwards, the movie begins with an old lady dying in a hospital bed.  Her daughter is by her side while a major hurricane is approaching.<br /><br />We move to a story about a couple whose son died in the war.  The heartbroken father designs a special clock for the railroad station whose hands move backward, in the hopes of turning time back, so all the sons lost in the war can return home.  Of course, no one else appreciated the man's noble idea.  He disappeared in disgrace.<br /><br />Back to the hospital scene, Mom gives her daughter a book to read, the story of Benjamin Button (played by the talented and handsome Brad Pitt).  About 1920, a woman is dying of childbirth.  The father is overwrought when he sees his son, not only because of his wife's condition but also because the baby looks like a little old man.  He grabs the baby and runs.  Unable to throw him in the river, he abandons him on the doorstep of a single woman's home.  A doctor examines the baby and declares he is dying of old age diseases and does not have long to live, but the woman takes pity on this poor ugly child and decides to love him for whatever short time he has left.<br /><br />As time continues, Benjamin slowly begins to grow younger and straighter.  He meets a young girl (about age 12?) and they become great friends.  After all, Benjamin is really a child in an old man's body.  The young girl grows up to be Cate Blanchett, \\"the woman he is destined to love forever\\" as it says on the DVD case.<br /><br />This is not an action flick, but the story of a very unusual man and the events surrounding his life.  In that respect, it is a slow-moving flick but it is a good story with good actors, and very much worth watching. It is also a love story, about a woman's love for a very different child and about a couple who are very much in love.  It's also about forgiveness, and about determination.  Tired as I was, I stayed up way past my bedtime to finish watching it..  Tired as I was, I stayed up way past my bedtime to finish watching it.
B0000041Z5|5.0|I love these performances by Solti. Then I don't. But I really do. Sound confused? I truly admire these excellent performances of Brahms' symphonic cycle. This is straightforward Brahms. Great conducting. I expected that by Solti. It also has tremendous bulldog orchestral syncopation by one of America's consistently best orchestras since WWII. I don't expect to see much better conducting or playing. So why am I so torn by Solti's great performances? He plays the music as honestly as it can be played. The orchestra couldn't play the multilayered soaring with gravitas Brahms demands any better. So, I ask myself, why am I so torn with admiration and yet reluctant to do any more than acknowledge this is a masterful rendition.     Solti does not quite \\"get\\" Brahms. He's close, but yet far. Since he does not quite apprehend Brahms emotionally, he plays technically and rationally as well as possible, striking a compromise between Brahm's lushness and his form. Nobody plays technically much better on Brahms than this. And his noble effort demands appreciation. This Solti is a great conductor. And his compromise approach to Brahms is very good, and yes, even masterful. He beats most conductors out on points. I like his presentation as well as Klemperers and better than most others. As I said, I truly admire Solti and his presentations. They are honest and solid. But O' that we could have Giulini's historic '60s Philharmonia set (EMI) or his Vienna Philharmonic 20 year later cycle (DG) reproduced and reviewed as well. Or Celibidache's Munchner Philharmoniker cycle as well (It is available on Amazon.) . Ah well, maybe we are in a merchandising world where we need to simply appreciate such an honest and straightforward approach like Solti's. This is a good compromise and one of the more honest approaches to Brahms I have ever heard.     Good man, Solti, I miss you for many many reasons. And this is one of them. Get these performances. They are honest, and they are extremely well done. Bravo!
006091307X|2.0|I would give this book 2.5 stars if possible. Good, but not great.    I \\"get\\" the book, and I sympathize with those on both sides; read any of the reviews here and you'll see how extremely polarizing this book (and, indeed, Pynchon, in general) is.    As another reviewer said: it is interesting but not compelling. Paranoia for paranoia's sake. The ending was fitting, and I don't fault that. It has its moments as well as some genuinely funny passages. But the characters are forgettable. A lot of it is forgettable. It's one of those books where it's more satisfying to describe the plot than it is to actually read the book. In all, there may be about five memorable passages in the whole story.    I'm glad I read it and, perhaps, I may read it again to give it another chance. I found that it was a hard book to hate, and easy to like--or, rather, easy to *want* to like. But after giving it some thought, it seems that it tries too hard to say too much without saying anything of any significance at all.     But worse things could be said about a book. At least he tried.
1427206031|4.0|Jeffrey Archer's \\"Paths of Glory\\" dramatizes the life of mountaineer George Mallory who was part of the multiple expeditions sent by the British Everest Committee and the Royal Geographic Society to scale Mt. Everest. During the third attempt to scale Everest in 1924, Mallory and Andrew Irvine disappeared. For three quarters of a century, Mallory's fate as well as the answer of whether he and Irvine reached the summit reamined the subject of speculation and conjecture. When in 1999, the body of George Mallory was found, speculation began anew.<br /><br />Drawing on primary sources and exercising dramatic license, Archer tells a thoroughly engaging story. Archer takes liberty with history most notably with the details of the three expeditions (Archer only has Mallory going on two expeditions). Archer's Mallory suffers from being less of a man and more of an infallible paragon.<br /><br />Roger Allam's narration of Archer's text is superb. He is pitch-perfect in every detail and it was impossible to not get caught up with Allam. Allam's narration only adds to the work.<br /><br />In the end, it is hard to decide whether Archer's work merits a 4 star or a 5 star rating. I think Archer could have told essentially the same story without taking his liberties with history. At the end of the day though, Archer's liberties and his drawing of Mallory's character knock it down to 4 stars.
B001P9KR94|1.0|I am glad I did not spend one cent to watch this so at least I still have my money, but what about the 2 hours of my life that are gone forever? As the dance number like some whacked out version of HSM ends this abortion of a film I am left wondering, are the Oscars a rigged event or is this what is considered good filmaking these days? Don't get me wrong Danny Boyle was one of my all time favorites before this Indian version of a Regis game show wide awake nightmare, but seriously what did this film have to offer? Charachter development that had all the structure and depth of one of those God awful 90's mentos commercials. Seriously this is the year that you walk away from the hype, choose for yourself. If you would not normally pick up a movie about an Indian bum who has all the emotion of R2-D2 and wins on a game show, roll end credits with highly ridiculous dance number, then don't change your mind for the words BEST PICTURE.
B001FB4VZS|2.0|Granted I know this is another version of Superman but the route that the writers are going it is completely messing with the mythos! Lois has seen Clark without glasses, he's working with her now at the DP without glasses, how dumb would Lois have to be to not recognize that Clark Kent is Superman when he puts on the tights and cape! While Lois and Clark make for some funny moments, the romance chemistry just isn't there! Personally I feel like the whole thing is being rushed.    When it comes to the Doomsday/Davis/Clark plot, I was left thinking \\"What are the writers doing?! grasping at straws for something to watch every week?\\" The Clark and Lana arc was \\"resolved\\" I guess you could say thanks to Lex, who returned as knock-off Darth Vader, who sadly was not even Michael Rosenbaum himself! and yet at the same time somehow the Clark and Lana arc wasn't \\"resolved\\". For Clark to be completely obsessed and madly in love with Lana and have them ripped apart like they were and then turn around and have Clark and Lois just seems unrealistic, Satisfying to some Superman fans yes, but completely unrealistic if we're going with the usual Smallville plot route.     Some episodes had the tendency to drag or were just boring, I found myself switching to \\"Ugly Betty\\" at times. Even the actors seemed bored in their performances majority of the time. Over half the original cast is gone, only two remain, even the creators of the show left this season, you would think that would be a clue to end the show and yet they pressed on producing one of the most boring seasons yet. *sorry*    I give it two stars just for the two original cast members (Tom Welling and Allison Mack) who seem to be holding on strong and for the very sad and brief return of Kristin Kreuk as Lana Lang.
B001TODCII|2.0|It appears that several dozens of people liked TAKEN despite its many plot holes (several of which are listed in the professional review on the first page of this marketing site). This film does have much that would appeal to teenage boys: lots of fast-cut action with flying fists and bullets, plenty of \\"foreign\\" villains who get wiped off the face of the earth by an American good guy with a righteous cause, and miles and miles of car chases! And, for middle-aged women, it has LIAM NEESON--towering over other men, emoting, flexing his middle-aged muscles, and saying all sorts of heart-fluttering semi-off-color things.<br /><br />There are many other heroic-fantasy films which are just as good when it comes to fast, violent action: the BOURNE trilogy, the TRANSPORTER series, and HITMAN with Timothy Olyphant come to mind. If a person, for whatever reason, prefers to see fast action mixed with an erotic component, then HITMAN is superior to TAKEN and these others.<br /><br />In this film,  Famke Janssen, as Neeson's character's ex-wife, is physically quite good looking (but unattractively bitchy most of the time). On the plus side, when it comes to screen presence, Liam Neeson still has it, and his delivery of the few witty lines of the script is effective.
B0019X3ZZY|1.0|After having read positive and negative reviews of the infamous \\"Salo\\" for years i decided it was time to decide for myself. I mean it is directed by one of Italys most famous directors and apparently is a scathing criticism of fascism and study of the abuse of absolute power. How bad could it be? How mistaken i was! There is nothing worse than exploitation being disguised as high class art. The stature of the director and his attempts at giving social meaning to abhorrent acts of evil makes the events which unfold all the more unpleasant. Make no mistake, Salo is as bad as anyone of the litany of cheap, exploitive films which dot the motion picture landscape, bringing to mind hideous films such as Cannibal Holocaust. No film scholar or political professor can seriously argue that this film has any real social merit other then revelling in its well deserved title as one of the most vile films ever made.     All biases aside, this film is nothing more than 117 minutes of continuous torture and sexual perversion directed at young people. Any socially responsible director can get his point across without feeling the need to wallow in this filth with questionably young actors being violated in nearly every way possible . I have no doubt that Passolini either was getting his jollies out of the action being performed in front of his camera or was suffering great mental illness in order to allow his cast to be degraded in this way. It really is no wonder he was murdered shortly after completion of this film. I am a movie buff and have seen films of all types and creeds and cannot find anything remotely redeeming or of importance in this film. At least films like Cannibal Holocaust and Blood Sucking Freaks didn't pretend to be anything else. As another reviewer has previously said this is an evil film and leaves an incredibly bad taste in ones mouth particularly when one realises they have partaken in this viewing experience willingly and contributed to the films revenue. Considering all of the wonderful films around it is disgraceful that boutique label Criterion has endorsed and given this film the royal treatment. My copy now resides in the local garbage tip, where it belongs. This film is best avoided, even as a curiosity piece (which was precisely the reason for my purchase).
1416550534|3.0|Grabs you and the start, drags in the middle, and then really crescendos at the end.<br />If you're in the mood for a somewhat gothic, Edwardian English story, then this is a fun read, however, believe me when I say this book really DRAGS in the middle.<br />The story is about an English \\"Ladies' Maid\\" who dedicates the first half of her life to looking after the daughter of an aristocratic, and ill fated family.  For all intents and purposes her existence is simple but the events that surround it, and the secrets with which she is entrusted make for an intriguing and haunting experience.<br />All of the characters in the book are very well developed and the scenarios are fastidiously described (I felt like I was watching an episode of Upstairs Downstairs).  However, the author does a disservice with the placement of her descriptive rants.  When something really exciting is about to happen, I could care less if the petals of the rose bush look as though they are delicately weeping into the garden pond.  GET ON WITH IT!<br />All in all, a satisfying read but takes a little while to get there.<br />Rating: 3.5 out of 5 stars<br />Suggested With: A quiet evening and a cup of English Tea
B000026FOA|5.0|I am amazed that I lived 45 years, and somehow Nick Drake escaped my awareness.  The first time I heard the entire CD, I fell in love with it, and Nick Drake became my favorite musician.  It is many months later, and I have not grown tired of listening to it, and do so almost daily.  I actually purchased a second copy from Amazon so that I have one for the house and one for the car.  To explain his approach is impossible; it really needs to be heard to be appreciated.  He does have two other CD's, but this is my favorite.  I only wish he had lived longer.  I love this CD so much that I am travelling to his resting place in England this summer.
B00006LLLN|5.0|This two CD live performance is excellent in every way.  Perfectly recorded and performed, it includes many of the songs the band is best known for.  As usual, Alison's voice is angelic.  Jerry Douglas plays licks on the dobro that are impossible.  Great vocals and harmonies from Dan and Ron.  A solid rhythm section, both with and without drums.      Thw two songs from Oh, Brother Where Art Thou?, Man of Constant Sorrow and Down to the River To Pray are terrific.  Two old pop covers also - Baby, Now That I Found You and But You Know I Love You.    Highly recommended.
B001TODCII|5.0|The plot centers around an American agent who formerly worked for the US government in the Middle East and other foreign locations. His daughter is kidnapped by thugs from Eastern Bloc countries e.g. Albania in a reference to those who control much of modern sex trafficking. The 17 year old daughter and her friend are kidnapped and drugged along with many other young women and sold to rich men, particularly in the Middle East, another reference to reality of the sex trade as it exists today. The film also shows the complicity of some Western government functionaries who supplement their income by aiding and abetting these crimes.  The central character,played by Neesom, then uses all his skills to locate and rescue his daughter.  The movie is riveting from the first frame and Neesom depicts grim and resolute desperation in a way that can be understood by anyone who has ever asked themselves how far they would go to save a loved one.  This is a movie which should be seen by every American as it reflects the ugly realities of the modern world unburdened by political correctness. TAKEN is quite simply a terrific movie!
B001PJRAUS|5.0|For any Austen fanatic, particularly lovers of Pride & Prejudice, this is a delightful treat, with a brilliant conceit, brilliant cast, beautiful art direction, extremely witty dialogue.  This played on A&E, I watched the episodes in reverse order and decided it was a must have, must share production.  Highly recommend.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|Not much to say, they take the problem I have with the PS3 controlers and fixes it very well.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|Can a 2 1/2 year old really love this movie as an adult would...???    I think my grandson does!!!
0446615625|3.0|I only bought this book because I mistakenly picked up Stone Cold not realizing it was a series. I started reading it and felt like I was missing something so I looked online and realized there were 2 books I should have read before reading Stone Cold.<br /><br />Anyways, I never would have finished this book if it wasn't part of a series. I forced myself to read it because from the little I read of Stone Cold I was hooked and I wanted to get to know the characters so I wasn't confused about who they were. I can normally finish a book this size in 2 to 3 days. This book took me 2 weeks to finish. The storyline is confusing and all of the abbreviations made my eyes cross. I had trouble keeping certain characters straight. It was just a long, drawn out book that needed to be shortened and simplified.<br /><br />Really the only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because I love the characters. Olive, Reuben, Caleb, and Milton are refreshing and insightful. I enjoyed their personalities and different quirks. Milton's OCD had me laughing and feeling incredibly empathetic for him. Reuben strikes me as a giant teddy bear who would do anything to protect the one's he loves.<br /><br />I'm currently reading the second book in this series, The Collectors, and I will say the pain of finishing The Camel Club was worth it because The Collectors is wonderful. I'm zipping threw it like I do most books.
B001P9KR8U|4.0|I love this movie, it tells the story of a young man on the TV show 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire.'  Because he is poor and uneducated people believe he is cheating and the movie goes through incidents in his life that led him to knowing the answers.  This movie is thought provoking and entertaining.  Makes you laugh and cry and has a great love story.  I recommend it to everyone.
0880796863|3.0|A bit of background on this deck: The RWS deck first came out in late 1909 early 1910, and while little is able to be said concretely about which edition came first because all the records (as well as the original paintings) are lost to time. What we CAN do is construct a time line of sorts for the different editions of the deck. This is laid out very well on several sites online as well as in the book The Story of the Waite Smith Tarot. So the abridged version is that there are four known variations of the artwork for the RWS deck. They are called Pam A- Pam D. The conclusions as to which deck came when, is also well thought out on the sites and book before mentioned. When the now famed Rose and Lilly deck first came up on Ebay several years ago it caused a huge stir in the Tarot world and went for several thousand dollars. Then when it was announced that this set was coming out we all thought that we were going to finally get a reproduction of the famed Pam A artwork just as it first was scene almost a century ago. What we got is STILL debated in circles and on boards till this day.  The backs are indeed the original first backs made to be put on the RWS deck but the card images are from what is commonly called to as the Pam C artwork. This artwork was made from a re-drawing of the printing plates and looks WAY more muddled and murky then any other presentation of PCS's art. While interesting from a collector standpoint if you are looking to get into serious study of the deck, it's use of color and the fine details and things hidden this is not the deck for you. If you are a collector of different editions of the RWS deck pick it up because it's fascinating to see the differences in the drawings to the original. For those that are looking for a great place to start THE set you want to get is the new Smith Centennial deck that just came out. Even though it's only in a boxed set right now it is well worth the price and will give you a solid foundation in the western style of reading with illustrated minor cards. While yes there are prettier deck out there or decks with more `pagan' themes to them 90% of them owe their images inspirations to this deck. It is really the beginning ABCs of modern tarot, and as we all know the beginning is a very good place to start.
B001TH16DI|1.0|I'm rating this one start because I hate when studios don't spend the time and money for a proper release. Star Trek is one of those franchises that has been especially abused on DVD. Releasing a blu-ray set with only one one of the films actually in high definition is disgraceful. Give the fans some respect and put the time and effort into quality products!!
B000XGACHC|5.0|'Lawrence of Arabia' is, in my opinion, one of the best movies of a real historical war story (without overwhleming visual blood and guts scenes); and the struggle to acheive the impossible - crossing a vast desert in unbearable heat and wind condtions for many days with minimal provisions.  The dynamics of the cultural and political contrasts create an intense focus watching this movie.  One of the best movies ever!
B001C4CI8U|5.0|Before i buy the season, does season one have 1-20 or was it cut off before the April airing? I would like to know.    I LOVE THIS SHOW!!!    its like CSI + SIFI    well better.
B001TH16DI|5.0|One of the most satisfying BD sets I've gotten. And I gottem all. It looks and sounds fantastic. I don't even mind the bird droppings on one shot, that could have used some clearasil; and that's the kind of stuff that the hard core Trekkers have aneurysms about. For me, the set was very satisfying including the box. Restored Khan or DNR'd; all episodes reached the same goal. A great upgrade from DVD and a chance to enjoy the original cuts, which were good enough. I never did get a big charge from the Directors Cut of TMP other than an occasional, 'look at that'. The first one is fresh as always.<br />There is a great dissent about this set because it has not been 'restored to the max' and there are moments that could use it  BUT... It would be a great mistake to avoid this set in favor of a future upgrade. There will be one; but not as soon as many  think. There was much work done to make all these films look as good as possible for now! And they look and sound 'state of the art' within limitations. Better that most films from this period or later. Try it; you'll like it!
B000023VR6|5.0|The CD I ordered came in perfect condition despite the fact that it was released almost 10 years ago.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Not only is this pure Whedon (in all ways, since it wasn't just a Joss thing alone), but it's wonderful!  More of the amazing stuff that we saw in \\"Once More, With Feeling\\" - but not the Buffyverse, and not just a re-hash of the same thing he did the first time.  Even better, he snubs his nose at the Writer's Guild, and sidesteps the truly Horrible, evil Fox Network, which already Rules the World.<br /><br />This even has a very excellent ending, which I hated at first and then grew to love for its truly well-thought-out ways.<br /><br />I only hope there's a sequel.
B000WMEAKC|5.0|One of the very FEW albums I will EVER give 5-Stars to. I hope they'll bring another superb album out soon.
6305428387|5.0|It was fine.   It did come when it was suppose to and looks like new.
0425166805|5.0|I had read this book many years ago, after it first appeared in print, and purchased it recently in order to reread it. I found the volume fascinating on both occasions. My husband, a physicist who would be the last person on earth to subscribe to the notion that earth was at one time visited by beings from outer space, read it as well, and he, too, was fascinated by the speculations set forth in the volume--it lead to many interesting discussions between us. In our opinion, the author does not force any belief on his readers--he merely raises highly interesting questions that are difficult to answer. Since my husband and I have visited many of the ancient sites mentioned in the book, we can fully appreciate the astonishment at how such architectural feats could have been achieved so many centuries ago. While we may never know the truth in our lifetime, we can certainly keep our minds open to the possibilities--and Von Daeniken presents fascinating ones!
B001U0HBPG|3.0|This is an adapted screen play, not a faithful following of the original F.Scott Fitzgerald, but that is not the criticism. The story line is true, simply updated to contemporary times. Pitt and Blanchett are both quite good in their roles. The criticism I have with the film is in the directing. Several of the scenes are shot in shadows or half light which make it difficult to see all the details. Certainly this was a conscious choice by the director - but why? Same criticism with the dialogue - too much of it was spoken in soft tones and mumbling, which made it difficult for me to understand. I don't believe that the problem I've noted is me, as my eyesight is 20/20, I don't wear glasses and I have no problem with my hearing. It seems to be the way the director chose to make the film.
0451169514|3.0|This is one of the best King books I have read (The Shining being his best)  and I wouldhave given this book 5 stars if not for the last 100 or so pages.  The ending was extremely disappointing and I saw absolutely no point in the child gang-bang scene (Beside the fact of it being disgusting I failed to see how it saved them from their predicament). I also didn't really understand the role of the Turtle.  Anyway, the build up of the book was excellent but the ending was very disappointing.
B00003CXA2|5.0|If you haven't read the book I strongly recommend it. The movie is a five star movie, and the book is a awesome complement for it. The picture, editing, direction....nothing bad, from every point of view.
B0015NORBY|5.0|This is a classic and influential album. Sounds better than ever. I'm very thankful to have this in 180 gram vinyl. Worth the price plus some. If you are thinking to get this on vinyl, go for this version. Sounds great.
B00005V9IJ|5.0|Anyone that says it's long and monotone, let me tell you, you know nothing. Worth all the time in the world and if it could be longer, I'd prefer it. How Tom Hanks performed this role is sublime. If you get yourself into the movie you'll see. Recommend a tissue.
B00009V7T2|4.0|4 1/2    Hopefully TMV's dynamic duo go back to their debut once in a while to humble themselves musically, because this progressive rock, complete-ATDI-demise-justification entrance still stands in the running as one of the decade's most powerful blast-offs, striking a balance between ambitious and refined Volta has strayed further away from in vain since, in my estimation.
B001IBIQU6|3.0|Again, this was a disappointment. If it were produced by another band, the album would be tolerable. But it's Depeche Mode. There's little ambiguity, tension, irony or humor. The music does grow on you, but I'm not sure in a good way. It's often spoiled by simplistic lyrics.      From Some Great Reward through Ultra, Depeche Mode gave us something special and unexpected. The music was carefully crafted, a bit off-kilter, and interesting like few others. I'm sad to see it go.
B00000JKH2|3.0|3 1/2    Promising EP which show the band nearing a creative peak by assimilating evolving guitar melody at a more powerfully original level then ever before, carrying of few of their boldest compositions to that point but lacking some sort of pivotal glue to hold it all firmly in place.
0736063684|5.0|This book is a great supplement for bodybuilders and just fitness-minded people alike.  If you're a technician in the gym or just want to know exactly what you're doing when you're doing it, this is a great resource.  Highly recommended.
031606792X|5.0|This book was truly amazing. It was like you couldnt put it down and i never wanted to. I would recommend this book to young adults but not to teens due to some content. I just cannot wait until they put this one in a movie, i would love to see how well they do.
B0013527I4|5.0|This brings me back to my childhood when the family gathered around the t.v. to watch good, quality programming.  The skits are awesome, funny and witty with a sence of humor appropriate for children and adults.  It's interesting to watch the guest stars, many whom have changed drastically over the many years, have passed on, etc. And it's great to reintroduce to a generation, who knows not of, liberace, roy rogers, gilda radner, etc. These artists will forever remain in our minds and hearts as long as we keep watching tv shows like this one.
031606792X|5.0|I actually cried when this book was finished.  It is so great, and Meyer does a wonderful job of closing out the story without the reader feeling like there are details lacking.  By far, this book has more surprises than the other three, and they are great!
B001EYGOEM|5.0|Brilliant album, even better than her first one.  All the songs are amazing, I never get tired of them. 100% recommended.
B001ILFUDC|3.0|Great movie...but if you are expecting a coupon for a free childs fare from Amtrak as they have advertised on their websight....don't bother...it is not there and Amtrak claims no responsibility and will not compensate

B001ILFUD2|3.0|This was an animated Disney feature which was a free re-working of Oliver Twist, set in modern New York. It seemed to vanish without a trace after it's initial release, twenty years ago - which was a pity, for although the animation work is pretty pedestrian - the first to rely heavily upon computers, and  not much above the level of a Saturday morning cartoon feature, the voice work was amusingly several cuts above. Where else to find  Billy Joel doing the voice of a shrewd street mutt named Dodger,  Bette Midler as an extravagantly pampered poodle, Georgette, Cheech Marin as (of course) Tito the Chihuahua, Dom Delouise as the hapless Fagin - and then-teen star Joey Lawrence as the impossibly cute (yet feisty) kitten, Oliver? There are even heartbreaking glimpses of the World Trade Center towers, in some of the city-scapes. The villainous Sykes and his menacing Dobermans are perhaps a little too frightening for very small children - but on the whole, it is an enjoyable outing, if very, very short one, being only a little over an hour of viewing time.<br /><br />Of the extra features, I found the most watchable to be a pair of classic shorts featuring Goofy and cats: \\"Lend a Paw\\" and \\"Puss Caf&eacute;\\", with Goofy alternately rescuing a kitten, and defending his yard, his milk bottles, and his fish-pond from a pair of hungry moochers. (Slight detour there, while I reminded my daughter that milk used to be delivered, and homes would have bottles of milk actually sitting on the porch. Just for fun, I wondered what breed the invading cats (Siamese?) and Goofy is supposed to be, exactly? Mastiff? Great Dane? Dog of no breed? Another feature, the obligatory `making of' featured a look at the then-latest word in desktop computers, which now look quite clunky and huge. Nothing dates so fast, as the very latest in technology, I guess.
B000025H0Q|5.0|It's no Pink Moon, but that hardly matters. The important thing about Bryter Layter is that it's as sweeping and memorable and melancholic and uncannily beautiful as any other Nick Drake album, but that it's also more lush and intricate than anything else he's put out. He's backed by various Fairport Conventioneers as well John Cale on this album, and it shows; the songs are like siren coos seeping from a pastoral swath of English countryside, except that they're not weird and inaccessible like those of, say, Tim Buckley in his Starsailor period (not that Starsailor isn't a wonderful album, of course, it's just that it's a bit... well, weird and inaccessible). Drake's voice, which sounds like what would happen if velvet could sigh, is in fine form, and his maze-like guitar constructions are on display in all their universe-evoking glory. And there are also flutes and strings and pianos, and none of it sounds even remotely pretentious. The intricacy of Bryter Layter explodes like a flashbulb on \\"Poor Boy,\\" which is an oceanic gospel-jazz odyssey with samba rhythms and ghostly backing vocals. \\"Hazy Jane I\\" sounds like being left by the love of your life on a gorgeous summer day, and \\"At The Chime Of A City Clock\\" is like winning her back in the dead of winter. \\"One Of These Things First\\" roils with quiet bitterness, and \\"Hazy Jane II\\" lets a sprightly soul rhythm percolate under a lyric that's rife with claustrophobic paranoia. \\"Northern Sky\\" is almost unbelievably gorgeous, and it contains every precious memory I have of my childhood, as well as the intense sense of loss I feel when it occurs to me that I've left those moments behind forever. There are some pretty instrumentals, too. Neat!
B001AIRUP4|5.0|Of all the American movie directors practicing their craft today - either with live action or animation, Tim Burton is hands down the most distinctive in a visual sense. Knowing nothing else of plot, title or characters, I think any observer could unerringly identify a collection of stills from his movies jumbled in with hundreds of others.<br /><br />\\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" is the ultimate Tim Burton movie - a witty, complicated feast for the eyes - and done in that most complicated and painstaking way imaginable, through stop-motion photography. The story is as simple as a child's picture book, and the moral of it equally straight forward; best to be yourself than to be something you are not. Jack Skellington, the doyen of Halloween town, is bored with it all, and tries out being Santa Claus, with comically disastrous results. Plot in a nutshell, but ornamented with such baroque and deliciously dark detail!<br /><br />This set, which includes a completely remastered version of the movie and a disc of extra features, plus a digital version for your PC, comes in an ornate case about the size of a single VHS. This negates some of the space-saving advantage of a DVD library, but it is a very attractive cover at that. The bonus features include the usual `making' of feature, which goes into painstaking detail over how the character puppets were created and jointed, placed into the set and photographed one tiny motion at a time. There is a close look at  the sets - Halloween Town, Christmas Town and `the real world', a collection of omitted scenes, and a comparison of the storyboard version to the completed release. There are two standouts in the extras. The first is a short animated film by Tim Burton of his own poem \\"Vincent\\" -about a little boy equally obsessed with Edgar Allen Poe and being Vincent Price, which is narrated by Vincent Price himself. The second is a black and white version of the Frankenstein story; Frankenweenie, in which a boy reanimates his beloved dog. Both shorts can be spotted as Tim Burton movies from a mile away, especially in \\"Frankenweenie's\\" cemetery scene.oth shorts can be spotted as Tim Burton movies from a mile away, especially in \\"Frankenweenie's\\" cemetery scene.

0802714544|3.0|No spoilers.    Clearly the critical reviews of The Spy... are in the minority on this website and in the literary world altogether, but I have to say that this one didn't completely do it for me. The Spy... is lauded as the definitive spy novel and one that set the standard for the genre, so going into it I had extremely high expectations and could not wait to tear into it. However, after finishing it I have to say that it was not at all what I expected and for that, I'm a little disappointed.    Now, I know that one reason this novel is supposed to be so great is that it portrayed the world of espionage in \\"real terms\\" as opposed to the \\"martini, girls, and fast cars\\" lifestyle of James Bond. Given that, I wasn't expecting wild car chases and a protagonist with a seemingly unlimited capacity gun magazine; however, I was expecting some sort of action... anything. This entire novel is people talking, save for the first and the last chapters (known as \\"The Wall chapters\\"). Besides those two chapters, the novel is a lot of talk about past occurrences, so much so that you start hoping something will happen in the now.    I'm not saying this is a terrible book by any stretch, as it has clearly withstood the test of time. However, I will say that I respectfully disagree with those willing to give The Spy... the title of best-in-genre. I'd--without hesitation--reserve that distinction for The Day of the Jackal by Forsyth.
B001TODCII|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I did not see it in the theaters and I usually wait it out and buy my movies used from AMAZON. I really did not want to wait to see this one so I brought it at the full price. I have no regrets in doing so. This movie delivered big time for me! Great story line with lots of action. Well worth my money.
1401923119|5.0|The author brings the cutting edge science of epi-genetics to the average person in a language anyone can understand. Anyone interested in how their health is impacted from the environmental level to the cellular level and beyond will be intrigued by this information. This quantum physics based science gave me a greater understanding of how deeply stress affects my life beyond the natural ups and downs of daily living from the time of conception and what I do and don't have control over.  This is not a text book.  The author shares his story in a conversational, almost novel-like manner. One chapter leads to the next, then builds on the next, whereupon the ending is a surprise bonus... an easy scientific explanation of how man is made in the image of a higher consciousness (God?).   A must-read for anyone searching for higher knowledge!
B001AQMBJQ|5.0|Yes, it can! [zero spoilers]<br /><br />Can the best get any better, the stunned viewer (me) asks himself (see the brief answer in this review's title). One possible answer comes from watching LOST's Season 5 and, in this viewer's opinion it's a 'yes'.<br /><br />I keep hearing that Season's 6th, 121 episode it's going to be the last and that's such a pity. Season 5, finally, provides SOME hints of how SOME of the mysteries may be explained in the end but, unlike most TV shows, 5 years later, LOST isn't one bit tired and, if anything, the there is as much potential in the plot lines and as much enthusiasm and talent on display as in the beginning if not more - the actors are seem to have gotten actually better and there is so much substance and background associated to the characters they play.<br /><br />LOST is a masterpiece of a complex story - and now we know that there is one dedicated person in charge of making sure that there are no contradictions or time/space/identity inconsistencies across over 100 individual episodes. LOST delivers some of the most striking images in the history of a TV series and LOST takes full advantage of high-definition television - it could not be what it is in the pre-high definition era. LOST is just fun to watch, highest quality escapism, the kind of show you can watch over and over and almost never get tired of it or feel like fast forwarding to the next scene or to the next episode.<br /><br />And the awesomeness of LOST extends to the special features. Unlike many 'how did we do this' extras found on other movies/shows, these are almost always interesting to watch and there's also something to learn. Specific to the Blu-ray version, BD-Live takes us to the LOST University - classes are forming now so go register for some. You can learn about philosophy, time travel... many topics and, if you are an A student you WILL make it to the Dean's list. Non-Blu extras includes the exquisitely well-made (80's style) TV episode of 'Mysteries of the Universe'. So well made, in fact, my kid kept asking if THAT was the real-life inspiration for the show - watch it and decide for yourself.<br /><br />Here's a list of the 'extras' to be found on the various discs:<br /><br />- An Epic Day With Richard Alpert - see how LOST was made, last day of Season 5 shooting.<br />- Building 23 & Beyond - more on how LOST is made, this time see the writers at work.<br />- Deleted Scenes - I'm not a fan of these but some may enjoy more of LOST.<br />- LOST 100 - more of 'the making of', this time it's 'episode 100'.<br />- LOST Bloopers - funny, actually.<br />- LOST On Location - Go behind-the-scenes, on-set of seven episodes from Season 5.<br />- LOST UNIVERSITY - a BD-Live feature. I'm still working on my admission as I failed my the test - 17 out of 23 wasn't good enough.<br />- Making Up For LOST Time - the logistics of keeping track of everything across all of those timelines.<br />- Mysteries Of The Universe - quite believable 'documentary' done 80's style.<br /><br />There's not much more to say other than, 'get the Blu version if you can' because LOST was shot in HD and you will lose some of the sparkle if you look at the world of LOST through an upconverter - however, the DVD editions - I had episodes 1-3 on DVD before upgrading to Blu - have probably some of the best DVD picture quality ever seen on a DVD short of the Lord of the Rings movies.<br /><br />_____________________________________<br /><br />Note:<br /><br />I received 'Season 5' inside the [[ASIN:B0021L8FR6 Lost: The Complete Seasons 1-5 [Blu-ray]]].

B000002UAR|5.0|One of the most important albums by The Beatles was 'Revolver', released in Europe in 1966. It marked the end of their Rock and Roll period and at the same time had already some songs of what would become the psychedelic period of the \\"Fabulous Four.\\" 'I'm Only Sleeping' and 'Tomorrow never knows' are a good example of that whole new style. We Beatles fans had to wait two very long years for the release of 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band', the psychedelic album.<br /><br />'Revolver' has some songs as beautiful as a rare gem. 'Eleonor Rigby', a melancholic song about old and lonely people.<br /> My favorite song is 'Good Day Sunshine'. They use no guitars but two pianos and play them in a jazzy way. The two songs I just mentioned are in the old style - ballads and rock.
1439102813|5.0|I have not read this book yet but I am sure it is very good.  I am anxious to read it.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This is a television miniseries at its best.  Paul Giamatti is a superb actor at any time, but he exceeds his best in his performance in \\"John Adams\\" playing the lead role.  This miniseries takes you from Adams introduction into the beginning of the revolutionary period of American history, his role in the Continental Congress up to his death.  Laura Linney, has the role of Abigail Adams, his wife, his best friend, and most trusted advisor.<br />Anyone with a love for American history will agree that this DVD is one that you must have in your collection.
B000002GB2|5.0|This album is what brought Styx out of obscurity, for right about the time of its release, \\"Lady\\" had also become a belated hit.    Equinox is a killer album from start to finish.    1.  Light Up--Great synths.  Rewritten for a Pot festival (LOL) and probably their most uptempo song ever made.  Reminds me of Jimmy Buffet-style partying!  Sung by Dennis DeYoung, the bands signature and most talented voice/songwriter.    2.  Lorelei--Great synths on this one too.  I remember hearing this on the radio back in 1980, when I was just discovering the band, and I recognized Dennis's voice immediately, ran out and got this album, and just fell in love with it.  This song has those Styx harmonies I love.    3.  Mother Dear--This song has grown on me through the years!  Written by John Curulewski and Dennis DeYoung, but sung by JC.  Interesting synths on this one, and perhaps one of their LEAST mainstream songs ever done.      4.  Lonely child--Beautiful ballad in the style of Lady.  I know other fans don't like this song as well, but I've always loved it.  Written and sung by Dennis DeYoung (what a surprise right?)    5.  Midnight Ride--My least favorite on this record.  Never been a fan of JY's voice....although his guitar is pretty good.  Sung and written by JY    6.  Born for Adventure--Great rock song, with Dennis DeYoung in the harder rock guise than his usual mellower and more melodic nature.  I like him in this role too.  Great vocals here!    7.  Prelude 12--instrumental.  I think it's a 12 string acoustic, but cannot be sure (my musical instrument knowledge is not on par with some of these other serious reviewers =-)  )  A beautiful piece, and a perfect segue into this albums signature track....    8.  Suite Madame Blue--The BEST song on this album.   Written and sung by Dennis DeYoung, I could listen to this song a zillion times over and never get sick of it.  Beautifully written and sung, and one of his QUINTESSENTIAL prog-rock songs, in my personal opinion.  In concert, even now, some 34  years after it was written?  Dennis can STILL sing it as well as it sounds here.  Just blows me away!!!  Awesome guitars and synths on this one also.    ANYONE who wishes to hear what style of music made Styx so appealing to its fans??  THIS is as great place to start.  THIS is Styx....NOT CYCLOBARFBAG.    My highest recommendations go to this album!!
B001K3JF7K|3.0|The consensus here seems to be that this is a weak effort by the BC Thrush.  Ogerman is Ogerman: he hasn't changed his way of arranging since President Obama was born.  Against the mellow and somewhat generic cushion of string sound, Krall's piano and wonderful rhythm trio (a quartet with Paulinho Costa on percussion) don't make the impression they could if heard alone.  Krall is very much in a retro groove and there are many moments when her understated and breathy vocal production is eerily identical to Julie London's.  There's also a tendency at times to overarticulate in a \\"little girl\\" manner that isn't a good development.  But the only real bummer on the album is \\"Este Seu Olhar,\\" in which Krall has no clue how to sing Brazilian Portugese in a meaningful way--even as a purely phonetic rendition, the performance falls apart almost instantaneously.  On the other hand, I think her cover of \\"Walk on By\\" is out of this world.
B001U6YI92|5.0|This is the best edition of GBU that I have seen so far. I do not agree with the reviewer that complained about the absence of grain due to DNR. For me it looked sufficiently grainy and I could not see any DNR artifacts (on a 1080p plasma screen). There is some minor problem with the film's sprocket hole registration, meaning that the picture is shifting slightly in steady shots. This can be attributed to the 40 year old film technology, but it could have been corrected during the restoration.    The language and subtitle options are awesome, even the two audio commentaries, by Schickel and Frayling, have subtitles. I still have to take the time to enjoy the commentary by Frayling, which is new to this edition. The Schickel commentary was already on the 2 disk DVD edition from a few years back.     And, as mentioned by others, the cover states incorrectly a running time of 161 minutes, when it is in fact 2:58h (178 minutes).
031606792X|5.0|So this book is one of my favorites. I cried, I laughed, I had every emotion you can think of. There aren't enough words to explain how amazing these books are. Stephenie Meyer did an amazing job.
6304698690|4.0|Always a favorite of mine, The Secret Garden is an enriching tale about turning loss and sorrow into gratitude and love.  Recent orphan Mary Lennox is uprooted from her home in India and sent to live with her uncle in a faraway mansion (seemingly in Britain).  When she arrives, instead of being greeted by a warm, loving family, she is met by a cold housekeeper with a dislike for children.  Her uncle keeps to himself, still mourning the loss of his wife, who died ten years previously.<br /><br />As Mary tries to belong in a household of scuttling servants, she explores her own identity and feelings, which is new for her, having never cried before.  The turning point comes when she gets the courage to ask her uncle \\"for a little bit of earth.\\"<br /><br />This movie really captures the emotions of pride, humility, fear, curiousity and happiness.  It was one of those \\"comfort movies\\" I would watch as a young girl when I was sick.  Beautiful music, garden scenery, and message, ultimately.
0756404746|4.0|Normally I have a problem with a character relating his own past- I find it a lazy way of explaining the character, and I've seen it poorly done, especially when the author keeps switching between the past and the present. That is why I was so surprised to enjoy \\"The Name of the Wind.\\"    When the book starts out, you are completely in the dark as to what is going on. However, unlike some authors who insist on explaining anything out of the ordinary right when it is introduced, Rothfuss teased out bits of information organically, gradually explaining things the characters took for granted in a way that it wouldn't be jarring or obvious. In switching between the past and the present, the author also lays out tantalizing bits of information as to how Kvote affected the present day, and why he believes himself to be responsible.      There was such a depth of information as could scarcely be believed. Kvote's journey from birth to mid-teen years is so jarring it could have been it's own series- instead it merely lays the groundwork for other books. And you are left immersed in such a detailed and authentic world that the ordinary becomes empty, and bereft. This is one of the few books where I had to spend time processing the information, not simply going on to another book.    So if you're looking for an elaborate and interesting fantasy, this is a book for you. But if you're looking for self-contained books, look elsewhere, because \\"The Name of the Wind\\" promises to be the first in a slow, savory tale that will leave you breathless for more.
B001FBSMW6|5.0|The CD offers a different sound to Keane... and I loved it! Truly a talented group. We got back from their concert last night and they are just as good, if not even better live!
B001ED7C58|4.0|I wish that more of the score were available on the soundtrack, but there are lots of good songs.
B0021L8UM6|5.0|I've noticed most reviews of this movie are negative, both the writing and the actors were not very good.  I thought this movie was AMAZING!  Both funny and sad it took you on a rollercoaster ride of emotions.  Every actor did a fantastic job and I just wanted to put something out there that is POSITIVE for this movie.  I look forward to owning it when it comes out on DVD
B001U7WUW8|5.0|I owned Dookie on a cassette tape that my sister recorded from her cd when it first came out.  Then i bought the CD for myself, and it was the first CD i ever owned.  I must have listened to it 500 times.    So now I own it on vinyl and wow - the band sounds totally different.  You can understand the vocals.  From the very first drum hits in burnout the sound from this record make your room rock like the band is performing live right in front of you.  The harmonies are very pronounced you'll sware somebody hid guitar amps in your room - that's how clear the guitar is.    I highly recommend you buy this.  If you don't have a record player (like I didn't), go buy one and get this record!
B000002H6C|4.0|So this CD might not be the best but it's definetly awesome! The song One, The Shortest Straw, Blackened and a few others are some amazing master pieces or music!
B0007939NO|5.0|Brigadoon has always been a first class movie. We have seen it many times, mostly on TV, and once in the theater when it frist came out.  We would recommend this movie to all those people who like good musicals, made by fanstastic actors.
0307454894|5.0|Uncomfortable subject matter, but beautifully written.  Despite circumstances, characters were believable and sympathetic. There are probably many more similar stories from this period in our history. I am always interested in learning about what people experienced during and after Nazi Germany.
B001UV6C4G|4.0|After a slow start, this becomes a page turner.  It is mostly an exchange of letters between a young novelist and people who lived through the German occupation of the Channel Islands between France and England in World War II.  She eventually goes there and becomes part of the community, helping raise the daughter of a heroine who disappeared.<br /><br />To me the characters seemed real, believable.
B001TH16DI|4.0|I'm floored by the number of reviews here that give this a 1 star review, and then state that they haven't seen the movies.  If you actually compare the picture quality with these new BDs to previous DVDs, you do see a vast improvement.  Star Trek II, III, and IV have more consistant color and detail then what I saw in the DVDs.  In previous editions of ST III, I always noticed an upped contrast in comparison to II and IV: but in this set, it's in line with all the other movies.  There seems to be a lot of rumors here about what \\"Digitally Restored\\" is over \\"Digitally Remastered\\" (as TWOK was the only to get \\"Digitally Restored\\").  A digital restoration is when it's accessed that there has to be a new edit of the film due to the state of the print (it could be going in and adjusting color levels for consistancy or even digitally painting out blemishes).  It seems Paramount found TWOK to be the only movie in need of a restoration: when you see the other movies on a HDTV, you can easily tell that they are coming from an HD master and not an SD upconversion like some are claiming.  They compare favorably to other blu-ray movies from all the big studios.  I notice some of the HD interviews are the same interviews taken from the special edition DVDs: it's nice to see them in their original HD resolution (where the studio has obviously been gearing up for HD for several years).  Note that there's also some interviews from the special edition DVDs that were shot in SD and have been transfered to this issue (the main one seemed to be ST V).  The only gimmick I find with the movies is the \\"new\\" 7.1 sound mixes.  I don't see the need in mixing 5.1 to 7.1....but the lossless audio does sound great.  This blu-ray set is a definite improvement over any other issues of the movies.  Issues like DNR or restorations are always subjective; but these transfers are good enough that whenever the movies get a re-issue, I suspect it will be more along the lines of adding more featurettes (or rendering out HD resolutions of the CG shots in the case of TMP).<br /><br />***Addition****<br /><br />Since there are still more 1 star reviews, I thought I should address the misinformation about what remastering means in relation to Blu-Ray.  It's impossible for any of these movies to have come from a DV (digital video: SD DVD resolution) because studios have been working in 2k resolutions for awhile.  A 2k file is 2048 pixels wide by X number high (it's a standard that has varying aspects....with some of my 3D files, I work in 2048x2048).  Studios are currently converting to 4k work for new movies and for film restorations of older titles.  So the restoration for TWOK might have been scanned at 4k for the 35mm scenes and 8k for the 70mm VFX.  The other movies could have been scanned a number of years ago, but the studio would still have masters that are at least 2k resolutions.<br /><br />  Now studios do not author BDs themselves: they go hire companies to do that.  So for a genuine HDTV movie, Blu-Ray title, or DVD title the company is getting a copy of the 2k studio master and then remastering for that particular medium: for Blu-Ray, they rescale and process the image to be 1920x1080 at 24 fps....for HDTV, they rescale to 1920x1080 60I, and for DVD, they rescale to 720x480.  At this stage, the authoring company then adds particular DNR and compression appropriate for for the medium.  When it comes to DNR, some people are more against it then others.  I personally don't feel the DNR is that bad here: there are some scenes in these movies that weren't processed the way I'd like them to....but if they ever do get a remaster, it's going to be at the HD level: the studio master is unadulterated.<br /><br />To conclude my thoughts....it's a pity that the reviews here are getting dragged down by mis-information.  I gave this set a 4 star review simply because I save 5 stars for the extremely good titles on BD.  If you have a 100\\" TV, then maybe you want to waitfor another HD remaster with less DNR.  I'm not as anti-DNR as others....but I'd say that it's not as bad as some make it out to be: I still see plenty of grain for appropriate scenes, and there's not huge edge enhancement going on during scenes with too much softfocus.  And for me, the softfocus issues (only in certain scenes) and certain cinematography effects are a lot more glaring then DNR: things that were harder to pick up back when these movies were made, and something that's niether correctable in a transfer and is more clearly evident in HD.  For a 110\\" TV DNR issues might be more overwhelming, but for my more modest TV set with great 7.1 sound system, I'd say this is a no brainer purchase for any passing fan of the series.  The movies are marred by some production values that prevent this set from being a \\"demo\\" set, but I think the transfers do more closely reflect the studio masters.  All of the movies have never looked or sounded as good: they should be stunning for any passing fan of Star Trek.for another HD remaster with less DNR.

B0000AK7AB|5.0|I first saw this movie in a theater with my family. I thought that it was a well made movie. The special effects with the little mice singing, and the 'talking' animals, are cute. This basically is a movie about finding out who you are, and where you belong. Babe wants to help out on the farm, and because he is a pig, the other animals don't think that he would be good with rounding up the sheep. Because of his gentleness and politeness, the sheep agree to help him. The other animals see his ability to do this purely because of his kind heart. This is a very gentle movie. One that all parents should get.(There is one small 10 second scene with a dogfight). Nothing major. The two dogs,(male and female)get along at the end.
0316017922|5.0|This is my favorite Gladwell book thus far. In fact, I've liked each one more than the next. The Tipping Point was fascinating, but Blink left a long lasting thought with me - that my unconscious is processing data that I might shrug off as \\"instinct\\" - but that is valuable to my decision making process.<br /><br />In Outliers, Gladwell demonstrates some pretty convincing stories of how the top performers in various industries achieve their success: Hard work, circumstantial opportunity, and cultural legacy. I took his 10,000 hour rule to heart, realizing that the more I write, the better I'll be. It's pretty simple. Understanding the back story that leads to success gave me a clear action item. I've added Outliers to both my book club lists and it makes for a fascinating discussion.
1603090002|3.0|I tend to be prejudiced in favor of anything that Alan Moore works on, so I began reading \\"1910\\" enthusiastically. Sadly this did not last. Characters were introduced without development - \\"Dossier\\" provided background but not in a way that creatively jived with this work - and though they seemed very interesting the many characters' abrupt appearances and disappearances were confusing. The plot could have been excellent, but instead consisted of the characters we knew muddling about and accomplishing nothing, while new and interesting characters (Mac, for example, as well as Janni) did not receive the background and development they deserved. There was just too much going on, and it all happened too fast, to really let me understand anything very much at all. Compared to previous LXGs, it felt like being at a large party where everyone knows each other and about twenty-five people are introduced to you simultaneously, while everything important happens in another room and without explaination. And after fifteen minutes, they kick you out.<br />Alan, if you're reading this, please consider this criticism friendly. I've got a lot of respect for you and this story's still got a lot going for it. But break it down and spread it out! The structure of \\"League\\" vol.1 was terrific: there was a buildup to the plot, natural and individual character exposition, and good tempo. Please go back to that.
B000T5O48U|5.0|This film's story is simplicity itself.  It's the same as any old monster movie or Night Of The Living Dead.  Characters are stuck somewhere and the impending terror wants in, and they have to figure a way out.  Totally simple.  What this film does that makes it horror royalty and one of the good adaptions of King's work is that it keeps the main theme of irrational fears confronted with real fears from the novel.  Yes, we actually get to know the characters and understand them before they're thrust into the horror scenario.<br /><br />The film focus on a family of three, a father, mother and son.  All three are set up to have irrational fears as the film starts.  Monther is afraid of becoming old and cheats on her husband, who is a decent man, because she is bored with her new and more rural life.  Husband fears not being able to properly provide for his family, and that he'll lose his job.  Son fears the things that go bump in the night, living in his closet and under his bed.  It's not until mother and son are faced with a rabid dog by the name of Cujo does life fully come into perspective for them.  The killer dog is like a personification of all their fears shoving itself in their faces to wake them up into reality.  Of course to appreciate this new revelation they will have to survive....<br /><br />The acting in this film is all top notch.  Dee Wallace has always been one of my favorite actors.  She is really good at amping up the emotions and even making them big without becoming melodramatic.  Despite her adultery, adultery for no good reason(if there could be such a thing), you like her.  You understand her.  You appreciate her maternal instincts when it comes to protecting her son.  That is if you're not narrow minded or judgemental about fictional people that don't really exist or travel in your social circles.  I've always smiled when seeing other people judge those around them from a high horse, but I laugh violently when I see them judge fictional characters.<br /><br />The new special edition DVD is superb in picture quality and sound.  Finally, we get a widescreen transfer of this beautifully and horrifyingly shot film.  The last crappy editon was, for reasons unknown to me(does anyone in this day in age still actually prefer fullscreen?)a full frame release and was loaded with grain and a horrible audio track.  This new edition goes even further beyond upgrading the picture by providing new and interesting special features.  The making of Doc runs about an hour long and covers all the bases from everyone's perspective, from the actors, director, cinenatographer, and Stephen king himself.  There's also an audio commentary by the director, Lewis Teague(Alligator, Jewel of the Nile, Cat's Eye).  He doesn't just stick to going over what's playing on the screen but also goes into anecdotes and the history of the project in Hollyweird.  The only problem I have with this track is that Teague does repeat some info that was covered in the documentary, but it's sparse.<br /><br />Besides Teague's swift direction, some accolades must go to Jan De Bont, the director of photography for this movie.  I wish he had stayed a D.P. because he was much more interesting and talented in that field then he is as a director(The Haunting 1999,Tomb Raider:Cradle of Life, Speed 1&2).  But we have a bunch of old Verhoeven films and various other movies from the 70's and 80's that brandish his name as their D.P.  The camera moves are all natural, stylish and effective in further telling this story without blowhard expouses from the characters.<br /><br />Teague was and probably is still a wonderful filmmaker.  I'm not sure what he's done since the 80's, but I haven't heard from him in a while.  I would LOVE, if I had the power, to get this man back in the director's chair of a modern big budget film.  He's a lost talent.<br /><br />The only gripe I have with this addition is the cover artwork. I'm a real movie nerd and I love cool posterartwork.  The original poster for Cujo's theatrical run was really cool.  It was almost a sepia toned image of the old delapitated house with the picket fence and mailbox in the foreground.  The blood red lettered 'Cujo' appeared over this simple and basic image.  It was creepy and intriguing.  It gave no hints that this was about a killer dog.  The new DVD artwork is an improvement over the abomination that was the last DVD, but still isn't that good.  It's just an extreme close up of snarling, drool-encrusted dog death with a name tage reading the film's title.<br /><br />SIDENOTE:  A lot of King fans complained about the ending of this film.  ###MILD BOOK SPOILER###  In the book Tad dies.

B001UJUGZY|5.0|It's two days after March 12th and I've been searching everywhere for this movie. Just found out it hasn't been released....whudafxup. Sarah Michelle Geller and Lee Pace are two of my favorites and I'm dying to see it, but where the heck is it?
0375831002|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a while. Compelling characters. Set in pre WWII Germany and through the wartime. Great read.
B001FBSMF8|4.0|I know the Soundgarden/Audioslave purists are up in arms about this latest effort from Mr Cornell.  And it's true that many of the cuts are overproduced.  But to say, as many have, that Chris Cornell is completely \\"lost\\" under Timbaland's overdubbing is not accurate.  Cornell's voice is still the driving force in these songs.  It's simply different.  The songs are hook-laden and several will probably win him a whole new set of fans.  The VOICE is enough to keep everyone coming back.  And ya know what?  The next CD from Chris Cornell will undoubtedly be different again.  Besides, \\"Scream\\" is still far and away better than his second solo effort, \\"Carry On.\\"  Now that was a total loss!!
B0018CWEYY|3.0|I am amazed how well this season has been received. I have been watching and loving Lost since it's beginning and found that by the third or fourth episode of season 4 something was wrong. The change was subtle at first but before long the small tumbling rocks started a landslide. The writing wasn't as good as it had been and there were substantial changes in the tone of the show. By about the halfway point in the season characters were openly defying their own established tendencies for no other reason than careless and seemingly hastily written scenarios layered with bad dialog. The mysteries were still in place but the appeal of those mysteries began to die for me. It doesn't help that there are a number of new additions to the ensemble and far too much screen time is given to them. The entire structure of the show had shifted into something far more formulaic and very few people seem to notice or care. Maybe I'm missing something here that everyone else gets but less creativity and craftsmanship is going into the show and the result is that a show I loved watching has become a show I can do without.
1416500294|5.0|Arggggg, mateys, a fine read this is! I enjoyed this as a kid and it's even funner re-reading it as an adult.  Now I know where all those silly pirate cliches come from.  It's all there....Long John Silver with his wooden leg and the parrot on his shoulder, the treasure map with \\"X marks the spot,\\" and a kid hero taking on the bad guys.  You can't go wrong with this book. Read it, swabby!
0307387178|3.0|First off I want to pay my condolences to the parents of Chris McCandless, who were worried sick by the disappearance of their child, and after endless months of panic, found he had turned up dead in Alaska.     Chris was a charismatic boy who had everything he could have ever wanted. He had a family who seemed to love him, and just wanted the best for him.  (Typical.)  Chris however, did not get the satisfaction he wanted out of life.  He wanted to experience the more rugged side of nature.  As he was driving out into the country to start his new life as a nomad, he was struck by a flash flood.  He abandons his car, and burns his money.  He hitch hikes into wilderness all over the country.  Eventually he reaches Alaska, where he attempts to survive with minimal gear.  So minimal, many call him a complete fool.  Later he is discovered dead by a group of hunters.  He was to believed to have died from ingesting a poisonous plant.      The book its self was well written and did a good job at outlining Chris's adventure, and other similar adventures of other individuals.  If I had been researching the dangers of the wilderness, this would have been an excellent book.  However, I had intended to read a narrative about ones mad battle with the harsh part of the world most people never experience.  Instead I read about how people though Chris, (and people looking for the same things as Chris,) idiots.  I think this is wrong, because he wanted something in life, and he was not getting it from his pampered lifestyle.  It was selfish to leave his family alone, but if he wanted to go to the wilderness unprepared, and found meaning to his life, so be it.  However, it is not a good book for someone reading for suspense, or emotion.      Thanks for reading, please leave helpful feedback!  Nick
B001TH16DI|5.0|As Bill Shatner himself said, \\"Get a life!\\".    I am a huge Trekkie (yes, I prefer that term to Trekker) so getting these six films plus a disc featuring a 70 minute roundtable with Shatner, Nimoy, Stewart and Frakes for a mere $80.00.............on Blu ray!.....was a no brainer.      I have sampled all discs and the picture and sound quality are fantastic.  I have no complaints.  In fact, my expectations were surpassed.  Sure, 'Wrath of Khan' was the only film to receive a full restoration.  Not to knock the other films too hard but it's probably the only one that really deserved it.  Are the other films lacking for not receiving the same treatment?  No, not really.    Am I upset about the lack of \\"Director's\\" or \\"Extended\\" cuts?  Not at all.  'The Motion Picture' is too long for it's own good anyways and I find the theatrical version has much better pacing.  I grew up watching 'The Wrath of Khan' on VHS so when the 2 disc DVD came out in 2002, that version just didn't seem quite right.  It's not what I had been used to watching for 15 or so years.  The minimal extra footage from 'The Undiscovered Country' can't really be missed either.    For clarity:      1-) All the movies are presented in 1080p high definition.    2-) The bonus features that have been carried over from the 2 disc DVD releases are presented in standard definition.  These features comprise the \\"12 Hours Of Previously Released Material\\" that is mentioned on the packaging.    This really is a great set and it's too bad that so many people would  completely dismiss a product before they have even seen it.  You are missing out.
0312944926|1.0|Oh my...  Talk about riding the wave.  This book must have been written in Dan Brown's spare time while flying around signing his one of his best sellers.  This should never have made it to press.     IF you read the book and believe anything found within it you must not be reading this on a computer.  Basic knowledge would have precluded you from any belief in this book.      IF I had it to do over again I would have bought any other book sitting near this one... actually I would have opt'ed for sitting on a flight, in coach, with nothing to do for 8 hours rather than have to read this book again.  I only finished it in the hopes it would get better.  It didn't...
B001AVEJ1Y|1.0|An evil alien endangers the Star Trek universe by opening up a nightmarish alternate reality.  No, that's not a summation of the plot, that's J.J. Abrams takeover of the Trek \\"franchise.\\"  This new turkey flies under the motto: \\"It's not your father's 'Star Trek.'\\"  Well,  take heart, kid, you'll get it right some day.<br /><br />The Abrams team bragged that their lack of experience with the \\"franchise\\" has given them a fresh perspective.  Nope, they simply don't have the experience to know what to keep, and what to discard.  The film is mainly an excuse to have twenty-somethings reprise these familiar roles while infusing them with the latest pop sensibilities.  Uhura, for example, threatens to Beyonce the film, as she forms the focus of everyone's romantic attentions.  The Romulans, not to be excluded, have their faces fashionably \\"tatted\\" all over.  They balked at getting pierced though.<br /><br />Supposedly \\"fresh\\" dialogue involves each actor repeating a groan-inducing signature expression, from \\"I'm giving 'er all she's got!\\" to \\"I'm a doctor, not a ------.\\"  Supposedly fresh characterizations include portraying young Kirk as a wild jerk - something that was old even when James Dean gave it a try (well before the original \\"Trek\\" aired).<br /><br />I reject the temptation to call this opus \\"Star Trek for Dummies.\\" After all, Shatner's directorial effort on Star Trek V wasn't Shakespeare, yet the sheer commercial callowness of this script is shocking. This qualitative plunge won't be evident to those who hate Star Trek to begin with, nor to those who grew up watching the cinematic lobotomies that constitute recent action fare, but it is there. The writers of \\"Star Trek\\"'s screenplay went on to draft the second \\"Transformers\\" film - something evidently closer to their level of taste. One example: McCoy derives his name here from losing almost everything in his recent divorce, save his bones.  Did these twerps understand that the \\"Bones\\" nickname is derived from \\"sawbones,\\" or that there's no money in the Federation?<br /><br />The musical score consists of a maddeningly repeated little ditty which is as emotionally rich as a cat food jingle.<br /><br />Production design is a nightmare too.  James Cameron once turned an abandoned power station into an intriguing alien vista.  Here, a redressed power station (actually a Budweiser brewery in Van Nuys) looks like... a redressed power station.  The bridge scenes look like they were filmed inside a juke box.  Exteriors are almost equally bad. Ryan Church - a prominent concept designer on the Star Wars prequels - created a new Enterprise which is simultaneously unimaginative, poorly-balanced and ugly.<br /><br />There were two good elements in this film: Bruce Greenwood as Christopher Pike, and a well-done fight atop a big drill.  Cumulatively, they're not worth the price of admission.<br /><br />Plot Spoilers:  This film also has Kirk promoted from disgraced-cadet to captain in one fell swoop.  The Romulans are eradicated from the Trek universe, their warbird motif given to the Klingons, and Spock gets to be virtually the only Vulcan.e's no money in the Federation?

B001M5UDGS|5.0|It's campy, hokey, and hysterical.  I love that despite being intentionally the cheesiest of the cheese, parts of it are poignant.  There's actually character development which is a testament to the writing and the acting.  It's short and worth watching multiple times.  The music is good, I only wish that there was an option that would put up the words to the song and a bouncing dot to let you actually sing along.      I know you can get it online free but I was hopeful some of the money I spent on the CD would go to the creative talent behind this wonderful, short gem. I hope the Whedon brother collaborate more often if this is the product.
B00007LTIL|5.0|This is my favorite album of all time.  I can listen to it no matter my mood, time of day, day of the week, year etc. It sounds just as great today as it did the day it was released.  I have owned it in every format: 8 track, cassette, vinyl, CD, and now MP3.  And I will buy it again in whatever the next technology may be.

0307450570|1.0|I was very disapointed with this book.  I was expecting more variety, but it had very little useful crafts for the 'average' person, in my opinion.  I enjoy Martha Stewart, but felt she could have expanded further in this book.
B001TH16DI|4.0|I couldn't wait, so sorry. Unmentioned local retailer was willing to match price.. Whooohooo!  Anyway I will buy from Amazon when I can.<br /><br />So my theory is this is going to be the only time we will ever be able to buy The Motion Picture in Theatrical Release. It has never been released on DVD and I expect they won't give it any more time or energy. ;-) So far I am watching TMP and noticed CODEC anomalies \\"glitches\\" every so often. I thought it was my HTPC, so I backed it up, and they occurred in the same spot in the timeline. So I don't know what this is. Please confirm if you see blocks or flashes at specific points. Voice audio is up and down.. Not a good idea at 1 AM. There are occasional spots or dirt... Just says film to me, crystal clear dirt :-)<br /><br />Definitely HD my friends. The SD content is the \\"extras\\" or interviews. No need to worry about that. Extensive archive here. If you know nothing about Star Trek now, you will become an expert after watching the whole thing.... Take plenty of caffeine tablets to get through that.<br /><br />Since I am currently watching TMP while I write this, I will comment on what I see. It's been so long since I have seen the TMP Director's Cut, I completely forgot how much development from this film went towards Then Next Generation. The Engine Room, Hallways, The Music. If you see other correlation's pipe in.<br /><br />In the end I am looking forward to the rest of the collection, any blu-ray TNG releases, and the Directors Cut, remasters. I hope the codec anomalies is just my system and not the disc.
6305014140|1.0|I wouldn't recommend this unless you enjoy watching women being raped (I don't) and women being raped by monsters (I so very don't).  Do not be swayed by claims of deep and meaningful plotlines, nor by claims that the rape scenes are necessary for said deep plot.  The rape scenes in this show are NOT deep or meaningful in any way, shape, or form.  They do not add to the story, except that *one* of them reveals the fact that the woman being raped has a body full of poison that kills the people who rape her.  Which is such an incredibly stupid plot point I really can't imagine where \\"deep\\" or \\"meaningful\\" would come from or how it could *possibly* justify the scene, which involves the woman in question being graphically raped by a monster.  And it certainly doesn't justify any of the other abusive sex scenes that take place, all of which are equally or even more unnecessary.    None of the other plot points in the anime are any more interesting.  Indeed, the plot feels horribly clichéd and weak, and the ending was mind numbingly stupid.  The main character *is* a good guy and a mildly interesting character, but nowhere near on a level to save the awful script.  Pretty much the only times I wasn't bored watching this was when I was too busy being repulsed by the aforementioned rape scenes.  (As a side note, guys?  Showing that one character in the world treats this woman like a human rather than an object or weapon does not make this an awesome show, especially when the woman in question behaves like a whipped dog that's just been given a pat on the head for the first time.  It is pretty sick, and definitely misogynistic.)    If you are looking for a dark or bloody action anime with an actual plot, try the Hellsing Ultimate OVA (though be warned, bloody is an understatement).  If you want something that really is deep and/or meaningful, I would advise trying Twelve Kingdoms.  If you want dark AND deep, try Kannazuki no Miko.  If you like rape porn, well, maybe you will get something out of this anime.  I surely did not.
B001U6YI92|5.0|This is an amazing movie that is extremely clear and and fun to watch on blu ray.  This is a must buy for blu ray aficionados.  You can see Eli Wallach's excellent facial expressions even clearer than before.  People have said that the picture is too soft, but from my own experience the picture is perfect from an average viewing distance.  The image does seem a little soft if you sit inches away from the screen, but it is crystal clear otherwise.  The sound is also very nice and makes good use of the 5.1 setup.  Don't let the negative reviews sway you, this is a must buy.
1419831933|2.0|Read part 1 on the T3 DVD and part 2 of the review is on the Terminator 3 Swordfish double feature reviews. So yes I said I loved the ending and this film is bad but ain't that bad they had good action scences and a killer ending you got to see Judgement Day the   music playin is great  the songs called radio it's the only reason to get the sh***y soundtrack. While Nick Sthal blew chunks as John Connor his voiceover while Judgement Day is happening sends chills to your spine that's the only good thing about Sthal playing John Connor Schwarzenegger was the only good casting it's not Christina Lokken's fault that the T X was a mediocre villan it's the cliche script by JD Brancato & Micheal Ferris who I don't respect. They also wrote the script Terminator Salvation which comes  out next week I'm happy that we have no Nick Sthal as John Connor Christan Bale will be cool I like him alright he's a pretty good Batman. Linda Hamilton will narrate the movie no Claire Daniels. PG13 makes me a little nervous though
B001RIY4WE|5.0|I saw this film in 1996 as well and now own this 1991 classic on blu ray & I'm really looking forward to this re release of T2 blu ray because it's a special editilon T2. Basically there's a new Terminator a T 1000 played by Robert Paterick this Terminator is made of liquid metal and can turn his arms into knifes and swords. He's sent from 2029 to kill John Connor as kid he's played by Edward Furlong. Arnold is the good guy in this 1. He plays the T 101 I love the Father Son relationships between John and The Terminator and Linda Hamilton returs as Sarah Connor. She's in a mental institute where she is abused by the guards everyday and sexually abused in the exterme editilon. Micheal Biehn returns for like 2 minutes when in a dream Sarah's having. He's uncredited becuse it's from the exterme version. The Terminator saves Sarah but doesn't trust the Terminator she also trys to destroy his chip in the exterme version but grows to respect him  they all 3 want destroy Cyberdyne and prevent Judgment Day.
B001TK80C0|2.0|I wish James Cameron would've directed this movie Johnaton Mostow gave it a college try I respect him for that. John D Brancato and Micheal Ferris gave Christina Lokken a cliche character oh she has a projectile cannon a flame thrower and her hands can also turn into a circular saw Lokken plays the T X. Brancato & Ferris gave her cheesy lines when Arnold shoud've had them but they gave him talk to the hand one of the worse line of the late 90's early 2000's. When the   T X is pulled over by a cop she expands her breasts and tells  the cop I like your gun. Or When she arrives from the year 2032 a she's butt necked of course like all Terminator films this woman asks her if she's alright T X responds I like your car. It doesn't even show the lady getting killed. To my point in T1 Arnold didn't say much in T2 Robert Patrick didn't say much they were cold calculating killing machines. Another bad thing Edward Furlong didn't return for personal issues we got Nick Sthal who was a gay, sissy John Connor.
B000F9RB9Y|4.0|I believe this was Cameron's first film I was able to see this on VHS back in 1996 this is a Sci fi/acton/ horror film from 1984 that I now own on blu ray. Arnold Schwarzenegger is the Terminator Micheal Biehn plays Kyle Reese a soldier from 2029 he's the Ultimate protector Linda Hamilton plays Sarah Connor. So in the Year 2029 machines are the ruling class and they want to wipe out the rest of the human race and the leader is John Connor. Skynet the super computer that runs the machines send there newest invention back to 1984 to kill his mother Sarah Connor this invention a Terminator a metal endoskelon over artificial skin but looks entirely human. Kyle Reese volunteers to go after the Terminator. The story progresses well I really wish they would have kept the scene where Reese breaks down and when it show the Cyberdyne Systems sign in the ending. This movie is about survival and Sarah Connor & Reese falling in love & becoming almost disturbed as Reese & a killing machines   that kills anyone.
B000EWBKKI|5.0|Continued from my Terminator 2 Skynet edition review read it first before reading this.  Basically John Connor and Sarah and the Terminator need to destroy Cyberdyne Systems in order to prevent Judgment Day but they have T 1000 on there a**  and must find a way to destroy an unstoppable killing machine. In the Cyberdyne Systems scene is some of the best Special effects in cinematic history better CGI than today I think the chase scenes are good the finish at the steel mill is just awesome there's also an alternate eding that's on an older DVD The Ultimate edition. As far as I'm concerned not by very many points but Terminator 2 is better than Terminator 1 not by a whole lot. But it's a great sequel and out does the original 1984 and that was a masterpiece.Get Terminator 1&2 today it's that good yes today. 9/10
B001U6YI92|5.0|Okay,THIS \\"IS\\" THE EXTENDED VERSION!(clocking in at 2 hrs 58 min and 41 sec),NOT THE 161 MIN CUT AS STATED ON THE BACK OF THE DVD ARTWORK,THAT'S A TYPO! The PQ is as good as you're gonna get with this masterpiece,yes its a bit grainy,but that's the way Leone shot the film! There are 8 different language choices!!!(including English 5.1 DTS and original English mono,plus Italian,German,French,Spanish,Portuguese,and Thai) All the great extras seem to be ported from the stellar 2-DVD set as well,also included is a brand new audio commentary from Christopher Frayling,of course the Richard Schickel commenatary in included as well! This is great Blu Ray release from Fox!!! Very Recommended!!! A+
B001U0HBPG|5.0|I am a sucker for an epic movie and I swore when Titanic came out twelve years ago that it would be a long time before another movie could come along and top it. With The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, that has finally happened. This film is so endearing and wonderful that I am not even sure which words to use to express its merits. In many ways, this film reminds me of both Titanic and Forrest Gump, two movies that are rife with humor and sadness--two films that do storytelling on a grand scale.<br />Furthermore, the cinematography is at times breathtaking and the musical score is absolutely perfect. In my opinion, this film is the highlight of Brad Pitt's career. Cate Blanchett, as usual, is stunning.<br />This is one film about which I can say \\"I laughed and I cried,\\" and mean it. I saw it last night as a Netflix selection and am glad my husband was already in bed. This means he'll want to watch it tonight, and I will be \\"forced\\" to watch it again. I can't wait.<br />I cannot recommend this film enough. Positively stunning and unique.
B00005K3NY|4.0|A weapons company with a division focused on a new breed of telekinetic humans called \\"scanners\\" has run into trouble from the most powerful scanner yet, Darryl Revok, a psychopath with the power to literally blow your head off with his mind. The company swiftly recruits and trains a confused and naive scanner named Vale (Stephen Lack) to find Revok, but his deadly mission will lead him to new discoveries he never could have imagined.<br /><br />From the renowned director of \\"The Fly\\", \\"Videodrome\\", and \\"The Dead Zone\\", David Cronenberg, comes one of his earlier Sci-Fi classics, \\"Scanners\\". This 1981 film has the dark, gritty look of movies like Highlander and Tron, setting a true '80's sci-fi mood. Ya gotta chuckle at the way they would cover the women in flicks from this period with so much bland clothing, right up to the chin, and still act like they were so very strikingly appealing, ha. Besides the excellent villain we get in Michael Ironside and Patrick McGoohan as the mysterious Dr. Ruth (not to be confused with that other Dr. Ruth), the characters in this sci-fi thriller could generally be more engaging and the second act can drag a bit if you are not so into the industrial espionage type stuff, but it is such an interesting concept they set up in the beginning and worth sticking around for the fun reveals and gross-out final battle! And, of course, the famous exploding head scene, earlier in the film than I expected, is really cool, and I'm not much of a gorehound, ha. The end did leave me a little uncertain, but not as much as all of \\"Videodrome\\". Though, I think that was the point of \\"Videodrome\\".<br /><br />Scanners is presented on DVD in enhanced widescreen with one extra, the theatrical trailer. If you are a fan of Cronenberg's other works or sci-fi thrillers in general, this is required viewing. It's not fun not knowing what people are talking about when they talk about \\"Scanners\\", so give it one viewing at least!

0307341550|5.0|Horror skates blithely through this novel, surfacing periodically in frissons of malice. This author enjoys a special talent: the painful excavation of the female psyche. Women receive no special treatment, are expertly dissected, demystifying the myth of kindness and comfort associated with females. As in Dark Places, Flynn's female characters are unpredictable, unlikable, often intimidating, sometimes violent. This grim view of womankind continues in Sharp Objects, as reporter Camille Preaker is sent on assignment by her third-rate Chicago newspaper, The Daily Post, to cover the death of a young girl and the disappearance of another in her home town of Wind Gap, Missouri. Staying with family, mother, step-father and thirteen-year-old step-sister, Amma, does not make for a happy homecoming. Rather, a tension-filled, antagonistic atmosphere permeates the family home, a pristine Victorian house filled with expensive objects and bad intentions.<br /><br />Clearly, Camille has private demons, not the least of which is a dependency on alcohol to soften the edges of reality and a compulsive scribbling of words on her wrist, as though to seal them in memory. As Camille works her sources, forced to confront her past in Wind Gap, one death becomes two when the missing child is found, both children bearing a common horrifying mutilation. Camille interviews old friends and former acquaintances, the reluctant families of the dead girls, a Kansas City cop brought in on the case. Here is troubled territory, indeed. Meanwhile, Camille's distant mother refuses to tolerate the ugliness her daughter brings into her carefully controlled environment. Under her mother's roof, a long dead younger sibling competes with an enigmatic half-sister, a changeling who is a sweet, compliant daughter at home, a wild, cruel creature in the world. Menace bubbles just beneath the surface, a thin veneer of domesticity hiding family secrets deep and dark.<br /><br />Not for the faint of heart, Flynn writes with the ferocity of a feral child. Reduced to the helpless pawn of a controlling mother, Camille flails about, discovering facts about the murders that threaten to unravel her hard-won peace of mind. While the police favor a transient or the brother of one of the victims, Camille is pulled in an entirely different direction. At one point I found this dance on the dark side nearly unbearable, a nightmare of past and present, unresolved issues and night terrors, Camille's only defense to drink herself into oblivion. In Flynn's disturbing, unforgettable thriller, every place has its own brand of violence, comfort is transient and terror waits patiently on the other side of the door.

B001PJRAUS|5.0|I am a huge Austen fan so I knew I'd love this. I couldn't wait to see it when I heard about it. It was so funny and exciting. I didn't want it to end! I loved all the characters even more with new surprised popping up through out the movie. I think that any Jane Austen/ Pride and Prejudice fan will love this!  I seriously watched this every day for a week after my first time watching it. I couldn't get enough! Now I'm reading the Lost in Austen book! :)

B001993Y2C|2.0|Many viewers have sung the praises of the remade BSG for years.  They love the intensity of the performances, and the Byzantine plot twists of this series.  The 1978 version, while visually dazzling, was expanded into a series from a TV movie at the last minute.  Consequently, it failed to offer well-written stories. Obviously there was room for improvement.  With all of that in mind, I tried to give the remake the benefit of the doubt, and to like it. I really tried...but I can't.  Here are some reasons:<br /><br />The Look:  Too grey, with a dull, washed-out look that was reminiscent of the bleach-bypass film process of the 1990's.  Sets and costumes weren't just low-tech, they were often \\"no-tech.\\"  This show was as visually dull as its inspiration was visually appealing.  No wonder the resolution of the series was a Luddite refutation of technology.  And if I had to see yet another hike through dark British Columbian forests...<br /><br />They Look Like Us: What a hoary cliche; countless sci-fi shows over the years have had alien infiltrators. Besides building suspense, it works because it saves production costs.  Sightings of the truly robotic Cylons were rare. Even Ron Moore's old show \\"Deep Space Nine\\" had infiltrating \\"Changelings.\\" So next time, give originality a chance.<br /><br />The Tipsy Cameraman:  I hated the drunkenly-bobbing handheld cameras of \\"NYPD Blue\\" years ago.  This BSG slavishly copied that technique.<br /><br />\\"Perhaps You Don't\\":  Everyone (and thing) reeked of rotten attitudes here.  Humans were preoccupied with mistreating each other rather than surviving their enemy.  The only solace was that the Cylons eventually proved equally self-destructive.<br /><br />Machisma:  This series (which had a producer from Xena: Warrior Princess) had the females strut, scowl and bluster incessantly.  Starbuck was the most obnoxious example. Most of the male characters (Apollo, Billy and Baltar for example) seemed strangely emasculated.<br /><br />The Music:  Where have you gone, Stu Phillips?  His rousing orchestral sound was replaced by moody blues.  The new sound was appropriate, but tedious.<br /><br />Oh So British:  America doesn't even make TV series anymore; this show seemed to rub its British/Canadian nature in our Yank faces.  The final insult for American viewers was putting up with the show's British TV schedule.s rousing orchestral sound was replaced by moody blues.  The new sound was appropriate, but tedious.

B001DJ69E8|5.0|Sometimes I play music while doing household chores.  These songs make mundane chores like dishwashing and laundry feel like they are relevant to the fate of the universe.     I really liked the Epicon album by Globus (in effect, the same people who made this CD), but like at least one other reviewer for that album noted, the pop-ish vocals were a bit lacking.  I even said in that review that I wished they had replaced the pop vocals with epic-sounding chorus.  I got my wish with this album; no pop vocals, only dramatic choruses.    A number of the tracks on this CD are remixes of ones on Epicon.  In my opinion, they are still worth the purchase.  For anyone wishing to know which ones aren't remixes from Epicon, they are tracks 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, and 12.
B001CD6FKI|5.0|Let me start off by saying I was never a fan of the cartoon. It came before my time, and as a girl, I'd hear older boys talking about it, but I never understood the fascination. Well, now I do!     The Wachowski brothers have created a loving tribute to the cartoon, and I love the international flavor of the film. But this is a Speed Racer entirely for today's video-game generation. What a wild ride! I can't believe it was panned by critics. Yeah, there's a lot of eye-candy from beginning to end, but there are also some incredibly poignant moments and a great deal of love in this film. The whole notion of family over industry is huge, and I love that the directors got some of the best actors in the biz to bring this point home. It's also wonderfully written. Some of the speeches of encouragement that the parents give or Racer X gives to Speed actually got me a little choked up.    I've seen this film a few times on cable now. And I believe I'm going to have to have it for my DVD collection. It's that fun!    One of the other reviewers here mentioned that it's like the first Star Wars film where the viewer is cruising through the Death Star with Luke Skywalker. Speed Racer is all that and more! Buckle up and blast off!

B001AVEJ1Y|1.0|I approached this film with modest expectations. It did not need to be great to satisfy me, and indeed I was pleasantly entertained by Wolverine, with which the new Star Trek has been compared.<br /><br />But where Wolverine succeeds (satisfactorily, if not brilliantly) in filling in the back-story of its universe, Star Trek simply shirks the matter altogether. Rather than trouble themselves by displaying actual creativity, the writers immediately escape into an \\"alternate timeline\\", then flagrantly usurp aspects of several previous sci-fi movies (including Trek and Star Wars -- hey, they say it's the most sincere form of flattery), before finally pasting them together with something called \\"Red Matter\\" -- a mysterious substance which seemingly consists of the gray matter extracted from this film's inexplicably enthusiastic audience.<br /><br />There are countless instances where the derivative script contradicts itself. Perhaps more than any film I've seen in the last 20 years. A handful that would have otherwise been noticed by toddlers are patched by some haphazardly added sections of dialog, uttered by a cast perpetually drunk on Red Bull (which curiously, unlike other products, did not enjoy a shameless promo inside the film). Several scenes and devices are so evocative of Star Wars that one wonders if George Lucas' lawyers are not already drawing up papers to prevent further confusion of the two franchises - and if not, they should be. The differences between the two are a primary reason they've been able to coexist for so long.<br /><br />Meanwhile, little, if anything, of this film's plot is ever reasonably explained: not the magical \\"Red Matter\\" that behaves one way at one moment, and another entirely just 20 minutes later; not what the villain and his crew have done for the two and a half decades during which the writers do not need them; and certainly not the reasons why a group of untested rookies with particularly juvenile behavioral tendencies immediately lands seniority on what we're told is one of the most advanced vessels ever made. Gimme a frigging break!<br /><br />Rather than address the film's issues, the producers simply distract viewers with frenetic pacing, applied to a disorienting cacophony of shaky cameras, gratuitous fight scenes, and explosions.  These shallow gimmicks failed to hypnotize me. This is a film to make \\"Aladdin\\" feel deep and \\"Terminator\\" dull.<br /><br />It seems that thought, experience, hard work, and personal sacrifice mean nothing in a new Star Trek universe masterfully crafted for today's audience. Roddenberry's constant undertones regarding duty, morality, and a vision for a better future are jettisoned faster than the warp core of a doomed Enterprise. The result is simply an insult to our intelligence.<br /><br />SUMMARY: Nothing more than Cloverfield in space -- with an identical monster and a lot more explosions. J.J. Abrams urinates on Gene Roddenberry's grave and thanks him for the opportunity, to roaring applause.what we're told is one of the most advanced vessels ever made. Gimme a frigging break!

B000000XCD|5.0|While the title track was successful when released as a single, the other single taken from the album (Bad moon rising) became even more successful. It just missed the top spot in America (as several Creedence Clearwater Revival singles did) but went all the way to number one in Britain.<br /><br />Other highlights here include Wrote a song for everyone (a plea for mutual understanding that is just as relevant today as it ever was) and Lodi (a very sad song), while the other songs are all worth hearing.<br /><br />This album helped to consolidate Creedence Clearwater Revival `s already high reputation when first released, but even better was to come with the next two albums (Willy and the poor boys, Cosmo's factory) before arguments within the group affected the quality of their music. If you're building a collection of original albums by Creedence Clearwater Revival, this may not be the best place to begin, but it should certainly be on your list.<br /><br />Since I purchased my copy, this album has been re-issued with different packaging and extra tracks. Amazon puts reviews for both versions on both product pages, but I recommend this album whether or not it has those extra tracks.

B001FB4VZS|4.0|It seemed that the show's writers had two main objectives this season: 1)Fire up the chemistry between Erica Durance and Tom Welling full blast and 2)Create and carry out a plausible introduction of Doomsday to Smallville. They accomplished both - a remarkable feat given that the \\"genius\\" in charge of actor contracts hired Erica Durance for a mere 12 shows out of 22! But this is a testament to Durance's talent and presence - she owns most of her scenes. Then on the Doomsday arc - it was clever the way they used the Pilot footage to integrate the Davis Bloom/ Doomsday character. I do think they went nauseatingly overboard with the use of Chloe in the Doomsday arc but thankfully, there was a payoff: (Fingers crossed) This season may mark the end of the uber-annoying hold Chloe had on Clark. I swear sometimes it seemed like Clark was Chloe's pet doggy and she scolded him whenever he displeased her and patted him when he obeyed her -oh, these lazy and cheap writers/producers - they consistently use the chloe character as a shortcut in plot points instead of using the more interesting but expensive comic book routes. Here's hoping this changes next season. One of my all out favorite exchanges from the finale is when Chloe tells Clark (paraphrased), \\"It's the human emotions that have made you the hero that you are.\\" And Clark responds, \\"It's those emotions that keep me from being the hero I could be.\\" Oh, snap! Hopefully, this really is the end of Smallville's watered down, couch-sitting, Hamlet-like version of Clark Kent and the producers will stay true to their word and move the show in line with the comics - which I hope includes getting rid of Chloe. Fine, don't kill her off but, please, get rid of her!! One character I was not sorry to see go was the queen-of-all-things-obnoxious, lana lang. I was heartbroken to see her back this season in five episodes. I took off one star for this terrible imposition the show runners forced on us. And, I totally agree with a previous reviewer in that her story arc was not only ridiculous, but laugh-out-loud insanely moronic! I, too, almost stopped watching the show because of this particular plot point. Seriously, Jimmy Olsen makes a more believable superhero than lang. Here's to this really and truly being the end of her! Speaking of Jimmy Olsen, I was briefly upset at the writers killing him off but, it was ... callously inventive how they introduced his little brother to be the \\"real\\" Jimmy Olsen who will become Superman's Pal and Lois Lane's sidekick. Aaron Ashmore has an endearing quality to him but he was too assertive to be the traditional young Olsen from the comics. I sincerely wish him all the best in all he is to do. I'm going to miss seeing him on the show. The scene he had with Lois in the finale was quintessential Lois and Jimmy. They really seemed to enjoy each other. Another thing I appreciated was how the writers used more of Superman's Judeo-Christian origin. Although, the analogies were sometimes much too blatant and extremely misused. For example, peterson comparing chloe to Mary Magdalegne - PLEASE, if the real Mary had been like her, the entire world would have been seriously screwed for all time!!<br /><br />All in all, I do say it is the best season of Smallville thus far due to the fact that Lois and Clark got good development in eleven of the twelve Lois Lane episodes. These particular moments are so good that I may actually buy this dvd set at the introductory price instead of waiting for the Christmas $15 sale. It seems that in the end, the multiple personality prone show runners thought this too - the DVD cover with Lois and Clark at the Daily Planet promotes the best this season had to offer and is my absolute favorite to date.<br />UPDATE 8/27/09<br />DVD Features:<br />1. All 22 episodes in anamorphic widescreen on 6 discs - much better than the pan and scan full screen version shown on air.<br />2. Two featurettes: In the Director's Chair w/ Mack and Doomsday-Making of a Monster - they couldn't have picked two more boring subjects<br />3. Two very interesting commentaries on two episodes -\\"Identity\\" (producer, director and Cassidy Freeman) and \\"Legion\\" (producers and writer).<br /><br />Episode List:<br />1.Oddyssey: GRADE A-<br />2.Plastique: B+ (deleted scene)<br />3.Toxic: B-<br />4.Instinct: B ...(deleted scenes) Focuses on Jimmy more than usual which he totally pulls off being the object of a super woman's affections and there's a really cool fight scene between her and Lois.<br />5.Committed: A ...The look on Clark's face when Lois admits to loving him is priceless and the last scene in the elevator is fantastic.<br />6.Prey: B-<br />7.Identity: A- ...(commentary)<br />8.Bloodline: A-<br />9.Abyss: C-<br />10.Bride: B ...In my opinion, the real \\"Bride\\" at the heart of the episode is Lois destined to belong to Superman despite the very unwelcome intrusion of the lang character. Honestly, they should have spared us.<br />11.Legion: B- ...(wierd deleted scene and interesting commentary by comics writer Geoff Johns - he states his regrets about not getting to write for Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen in this episode) The best non-Erica Durance episode of the season but not as solid as it could have been. Again, I agree with the previous reviewer when he said that lana lang almost managed to ruin it by showing her face.<br />12.Bulletproof: D ...Why was chloe still in Smallville when her new husband, Henry James Olsen was in Star City recovering from near fatal wounds inflicted on him by his new wife's would-be lover, Doomsday? Lois was the one taking care of Jimmy just so her dear, sweet, considerate cousin can stick around all her helpless friends who just can't live without her incessant, ignorant, incompetent and often murderous meddling.<br />13.Power: FAIL ...(deleted scenes) The butchering of Clark Kent's character and the ARC OF SUCK of lana lang in full swing courtesy of showrunners kelly souders and brian peterson, writers todd slavkin and darren swimmer and first time director alison mack. Either they were even more delusional than the lana and chloe fans or all their brains were buried in a crap infested toilet when they conceived this - it holds the shameful distinction along with Season 4's \\"Ageless\\" (another lang-worshiping episode as conceived by devoted worshipers al gough and miles millar though steven deknight took the blame) as the WORST EPISODE OF THE ENTIRE SERIES.<br />14.Requiem: D- ...(deleted scenes) The only thing that saved it from being on par in idiocy with \\"Power\\" is that lana \\"the girl next door turned Lex Luthor free-loader turned embittered, vengeful hypocrite turned Bizarro's skank turned insane thief turned giant turn off for Clark\\" lang finally left the building. The exit from Clark's life that should have stuck happend in Season 5's \\"Void.\\" It was an extremely moving scene played to perfection by Kreuk. I actually felt for Lana and hoped the writers would empower her from then on instead, the very next episode, they had her clinging to Lex and would repeat this sickening topsy turvey for THREE FULL YEARS until this sorry excuse for a story unceremoniously pulled the plug.<br />15.Infamous: B+ ...Very, very special moments here. Unfortunately, this is where they decided to turn Davis Bloom into the Incredible Hulk without the heroics.<br />16.Turbulence: C+ ...(deleted scene) And this is where they revealed Tess to be a total mess of a woman and where they did a 180 with (Henry) Jimmy Olsen.<br />17.Hex: A ...(most interesting deleted scenes - there are several) The whole silly chloe-is-Lois obsessively DELUSIONAL fan theory is laid to rest. You'd think that 7 and 1/2 years would be long enough to hold on to their delusion but these very immature people just couldn't stomache accepting the fact that the icons Clark Kent and Lois Lane were NEVER created to have feeble phlegmatic temperaments.<br />18.Eternal: C- ...(deleted scene)<br />19.Stiletto: A...The best episode of the season by far. We get Lois in a Catwoman/Huntress costume with Batman references galore and the real beginning of the legendary romance between Lois and Superman. They even used three notes of the John Williams penned theme song for Lois in the last scene. Very cool episode.<br />20.Beast: D- ...(deleted scenes)<br />21.Injustice: D- ...(deleted scenes) Tom Welling at his directorial worst, I'm sorry to say. This episode was TOTALLY POINTLESS. After viewing it the first time, it gave the impression that: 1)Oliver deeply cared for Tess, but then just a few episodes into the following season, he completely turned on her. 2)Tess is presented as a master manipulator, meticulously deliberate in every move she makes- following episode and for the entirety of season nine, she's shown to be completely clueless and bases all her decisions on pure emotion. 3)Chloe is played as a an uber-sweet, vulnerable, self-sacrificing victim of her own heroics... very next week, she's forever branded as the high priestess of delusional, narcissistic, egotistical, incompetent, murderously ignorant morons everywhere. 4)Clark seemed to actually have a solid grasp on who he is and what his purpose is then the very next episode, he declares himself to be more lost than ever - see what happens when you rely on little chloe to be your \\"brain\\" and \\"best friend\\" for eight freakingly loong years.<br />22.Doomsday: D ...It was not as bad as I expected it to be and has actually got me excited for the next season or two. I'll bet that Lois and eventually Lex will turn up with some form of amnesia.<br /><br />The following is directed at those who are unfamiliar with this series but are considering buying this set: If you've read through most of the reviews, you've noticed that Superman fans are split into roughly four categories:<br /><br />1.The Comic Book Fan Boys (mostly boys): These are intimately familiar with Superman lore and so are simultaneously horrified and fascinated by this show. They are very vocal in complaining about the changes in the traditional Superman story but continue watching this show because they love the episodes that directly foreshadow the future assured incarnation of an unleashed Superman.<br /><br />2.The Generation Z Phlegmatics: These fans are the current young generation that were born between 1986-1995. Mostly, they know little if anything about Superman before \\"Smallville.\\" So, actually, they are NOT Superman fans at all but merely \\"Smallville\\" fans with a penchant for the teen-age melodramatic, girly, idiotic, tragicly nonsensical romance stories the CW loves to serve them up. To them, Lana Lang is the love of Clark Kent's life and she should have never left the series. Or, if Lana had to leave then Chloe Sullivan should be Clark's bride. These have a special attachment to the manufactured Chloe character because she is one of them. Perhaps this is precisely why the show creators decided to invent this character - to speak directly to those who were teenagers and preteens when this show began. But wether they love Clana or Chlark, these fans have one thing that unites them: They all hate Lois Lane. They hate her because her character is nothing like them. They don't understand how this version of Clark Kent (whom the creators made out to be a phlegmatic-like character, at least for the first 3 seasons) can possibly fall in love with a woman like Lois - assertive, self-sufficient, irreverent and beautifully sexy with little insecurity - EXACTLY the type of woman the real Superman/Clark Kent (with his melancholic/choleric temperament) would fall hard for. The critical reviews with a 1-3 star rating are given by fans that fall into this or the previous category.<br /><br />3.The Superfriend Fan: This is what I call those that are not comic book fans per se but grew up watching or became interested in the animated versions of Superfriends and Justice League. They mostly just like DC comic book superheros and are not familiar or like very much the Marvel characters or any other comic book company inventions. These fans mostly ignored this show until about season 4, 5 or 6 when Smallville started looking more like its predecessors. They take this show for what it is - a new incarnation of a favorite fictional character. As long as the major points are hit, they don't mind this version too much (unless it's something as horrendous as the superlana arc!!!).<br /><br />4.Everyone Else: This is you. You've heard of Superman (how could you not?) and your parents or grandparents or great-grandparents grew up reading Superman Comic Books. When comic books were first invented in the 1930's until about the first half of the 1960's (what's considered the \\"Golden Age\\" of entertainment - before the dawn of the hippies and feminists and method actor take-over), reading comics was as common as reading the newspaper and were sold at all news stands for about the same price as a newspaper. Now, comic books are only sold on the internet or in specialty stores run by die-hard fans that scare off the general public for ridiculously high prices. Anyway, if you're reading this, it's probably because you like the Superman character and have become curious about this long-running show that is about the man-who-would-be. My advice: If you can easily afford it, go ahead and buy this set at the current $30-something price. You will be entertained and you'll love the classic 1940's style and feel to the sets and costumes - especially where Clark Kent and Lois Lane are concerned. If you're still unsure, wait for this to go on sale (it always does - usually within a year of release) for under $20. You won't regret this purchase. Ignore the negative reviews - as previously noted, they were made by disgruntled fans and not a true reflection of the high production quality of this show. Even if you don't much care for Superman, you will be wowed by the sizzling, sparkling, combustible chemistry between Erica Durance and Tom Welling....The best episode of the season by far.

B001UREJWM|5.0|OK....I already reviewed this and gave it 5 stars.  I still do but feel compelled to add to my first review (so I had to log in under my wife's name since Amazon will only let you review something once).  Dio is of course king so I feel bad saying anything negative about anything he is involved in, but........after listening to this 7-8 times I HAVE TO say that the drumming is HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  It is the worst drumming I've heard on an album in a LONG time.  Appice sounds tired, bored and like he may have been sedated.  There were several spots in the album where he MUST have made mistakes....there is no way that he could have intended to miss the notes he missed.  They may have just as well used a drum machine.  He did little more than ultra basic snare/bass/ride cymbal work.  He didn't even really spice it up with any variation in the volume/accents.  It was all low-testosterone plodding.  He may have hit the toms 5 times on the whole album and when he did it just seemed obligatory.  Listen to this album and focus on the drumming......you'll quickly see what I mean.  Maybe this album would have been better received if the drumming was more alive! Dio is god.....may he continue to create music until he dies on stage at age 100.

I bought this speedpad to replace a nostromo N52te for use with world of warcraft.<br /><br />Pros:<br />*This speedpad is sturdy and comfortable, even for my wife who has smaller hands.<br />*The software was easy to use and configure.<br />*The joystick is surprisingly comfortable after using a directional pad in the thumb location for so long (n52).<br />*The speedpad has a _lot_ of buttons.  some are in positions that aren't as convenient to hit, but hopefully you have some buttons that would be nice to be accessable, but aren't something you'll have to hit every 5 seconds.<br /><br />Cons:<br />* Sometimes the pad loses it's programming and has to be re-downloaded.  It never seems to do this in the middle of anything, just at game program startup.<br /><br />Questionable:<br />* Although neat, I'm not sure how useful the lcd display is.  The information you can put on it is interesting, but being over by your left hand, I don't know how often you'll really look down to check something and take your attention away from the monitor(s).
B000GZI6VE|5.0|This smurf is fun to play with as long as you get other smurf toys. Its a great conversation piece if you have it in a office, since other adults think back to their child hood and fondly think about watching this cartoon as a kid. Its fun for kids if they have it in a small village of other smurf toys. Its just neat.
B0026GBIB6|3.0|I'm 40 years old.  I grew up with Depeche Mode, of which I spent part of my time as a DJ.  To don't profess to be some sort of professional music critique writing for Rolling Stone or something.  Music is art and everyone has their own opinion.  I have an open mind and listen to everything (except country).  I understand Depeche Mode wanting to evolve their music, after all, they're 28 years older than when they started out.      However, I think sometimes you just have to take a step back and look at the big picture, not trying to analyze every nuance and aspect of their latest album.  The style of music and song writing that made this group an International success is sadly long gone.  Of course if it wasn't the critics would probably say they are just 'using the same 'ole recipe' or something like that.  I listened to this album twice.  Then I listened to some of their older albums and while this album isn't bad, it's just not Depeche Mode, the synth pop/dance band we all grew up with.    They songs, for me, are tiring to listen too.  Maybe I'm just nostalgic or something but these new songs don't have that Depeche Mode \\"x factor\\" of their earlier works.  The saying, if it's not broke, don't try to fix it comes to mind for some reason.
B001EAWMGA|5.0|Plenty to read about how the W brothers buried yet another fine film, but those two are a case study in having great films distributed incorrectly. Aside from them - what a great sci-fi film.<br /><br />We have inter-planetary travel, love, loss, awesome looking dragon creatures with firefly (glowing) capabilities, all intertwined within the Norse time period of our history. Caviezel has just the right look to be the believable yet fearless fighter that hunts these creatures across the universe.<br /><br />The effects looked adequate, and excelled during any of the ship sequences off planet. I have read most of the criticisms about pacing, time period gaffs and such, but overall I think they made a solid film. The DVD has over 32 minutes of deleted scenes that help answer some of the questions raised while watching the theatrical cut (which runs 115 minutes itself). The alternate opening would have helped with the end - but watching a space ship spiral towards Earth works better. The scenes with his Captain would have been nice to see in the main cut, as would most of the others but oh well. Some nice informative supplements for the special effects also.<br /><br />Customers have been asking for this since last year, and playing it alone has generated quite a buzz. A worthwhile owner for fans of the film that would of course look beautiful on Blu.
0756405890|5.0|Excellent book that deserves all it's success. Not a Tolkien ripoff. Has an excellent pace and flavor. Reminicent of Harry Potter but not a YA book and not at all a ripoff of that excellent series. Great fun and entertainment all around. Can't wait for book two.
0061091480|4.0|I did find the topics discussed in this book to be helpful when it comes to understanding why we put things like unnecessary stress and worry upon ourselves, however this book could be more helpful if it included more advice on overcoming these issues, basically, I found it to be more 'why' than 'how'. I'd recommend having this book around and reading it every couple/few weeks whenever you are in a rut or a rough patch because it is hard to remember to apply these thought processes long after having read the book. One of the good things about this book is that you don't have to read all of it, you can just focus on the parts that are plaguing you at the current time ie: worry, guilt & procrastination.
159102594X|5.0|I loved this whoe series start to finish. Character driven fantasy with liberal amounts of dark humor, and intense action. It has an excellent pace but is definitely not rushed. This series while not perfect is finely crafted and written with care. This book, and the subsequent two installments had me hooked all the way through. Personally, although much different from them I put this on par with ASOIAF and Name of The Wind for originality, style and quality. This series, like life, is rated R and as an adult I found it completely refreshing. There are no cliche good or bad characters. Everyone in this series, like in real life, has good and bad qualities. Highest recomendations.
B001P5Q6FC|5.0|Lamb of God have had a great career. Ever since Pantera had disbanded Lamb of God have become the top metal band in the world. Metallica has grown stale and Slipknot is.becoming Stone Sour. Contractor and Fake Messiah are my personal favorites. LoG is pure American Metal at its best. Check out their catalog. Top notch
055358894X|3.0|This book has recieved way too much hype and just isn't good enough to deserve it. The begining of the book was excellent but the story turned away from Locke's early time living under the cemetary much too quickly. Could have been much more and much better had it not tried so hard to be the Oceans 11 of fantasy and stuck to the Dickensian beginings of the character. I may or may not read book two but the reviews for that one are not very promising so not really sure.

1881273156|2.0|I love it.  Five love languages.  Each of us has our own value placed on each one.   That's it!  - that's the whole book in two sentences.    It's awesome, but you don't really need to read much more.  Here they are... all five:  1. Words of Affirmation  2. Quality Time  3. Gifts  4. Acts of Service  5. Touch    Now, you have the whole book.  There's not much more to it, except that he basically says the same thing over and over again with different words.  I think maybe if he distilled it down to about 20 pages, this would have been an awesome book!
B000056NX5|5.0|I always enjoy the chance to see a broadway production, especially when they usually don't come to my little small town very often, so I found this film of the broadway production of Jesus Christ Superstar very cool.

074356619X|5.0|This cd set is great if you believe in a higher power. It really reminds you how to think more positive. These cd's tell you things most people already know but a lot of us never really apply it to our everyday lives. I have the book, cd's and dvd. I bought it last year and a few things that I have focused on has happened.  Read this if you want better health, more money, or just to remind you to be thankful for the little things in life.
0143038583|5.0|What a life-altering book this is!  When I was living in North Dakota from 1977 to 1991, the most inflammatory obscenity that could be uttered was \\"Agribusiness.\\"<br />Agriculture Secretary Earl Butz seemed intent on getting rid of the \\"inefficient\\" family farm, replacing it with large megafarms, all for the production of corn to feed the gaping maw of Monsanto and Cargill. Big businesses all. Under his government plans, the family farm almost disappeared.  \\"Get big or die!\\" Those who used to call themselves farmers, began to call themselves, after the government programs that impoverished them, Corn-Growers.<br /> Why this was the case is spelled out clearly in this insightful and well reasearched book.  Pollan manages to make this narrative as objective as an academic study and as personal as a memoir.  Because of this book, my family is now in a foodshare and buy all our meat from a local farmer.  All the meat is pastured and organic and we may eventually even be allowed to  participate in the slaughter because I am beginning to think that if you can't look the animal in the eye and kill it, you have no right to eat it.<br />Okay, that may be a little extreme, but gratitude for the life of the animal was once as much a part of the \\"hunter\\" culture in America as is the current disassociation from the food source.<br />What Pollan has accomplished is getting people to think about where their food comes from and reconnect even urbanites, who only see the prepackaged products in the supermarket cooler, to the actual circle of life that has sustained us from time immemorial, right up to the time when it was all corrupted by Big Agriculture which, in the name of the balance sheet, started producing food that will make us sick and fat.<br />(One might argue that the same ethos caused Wall Street Corporations to get \\"too big to fail,\\" and we can see where that got us.  But that's another subject.)<br />This book will anger you.  This book will inspire you.  Hopefully, this book will make you join the millions who even now are moving us back to a sustainable agriculture that is local, seasonal and more in keeping with the way Nature intended and, not coincidentally, better for the family farmers's bottom line.ou join the millions who even now are moving us back to a sustainable agriculture that is local, seasonal and more in keeping with the way Nature intended and, not coincidentally, better for the family farmers's bottom line.

076531178X|5.0|\\"Mistborn:  The Final Empire\\" begins a fantastic fantasy trilogy established in a distinctive world.  The author supplies all the aspects necessary for a superb novel, an overpowering tyrant, the oppressed masses, political scheming, well-developed and balanced magic, a host of appealing characters, and disturbing bad guys.  The storyline flows at an addicting pace, delivering the different forms of magic and reasonable action while addressing political tensions at the appropriate times.<br /><br />The book focuses between two characters.  The young Vin, a destitute yet gifted Skaa in a thieving crew and abandoned by her brother, must fend for herself. The other is the methodical Kelsier, formerly a crew leader and prisoner, now a powerful Skaa Mistborn.  Kelsier has ambitions to overthrow the Lord Ruler, an omnipotent godlike ruler, and recruits various individuals to support his plans.<br /><br />Other than Vin grasping concepts and skills a little too easily, she's a viable heroine.  While Kelsier may have a master plan, events force him to adapt the plan accordingly by making the best of an otherwise bad situation.<br /><br />A comprehensive appendix including characters and their abilities would have been useful.  Also check out the author's web page at [...] for excellent inside information and deleted scenes (he provides warnings before any spoilers).<br /><br />I highly recommend this series to any fan of the fantasy genre.<br /><br />Thank you.

B000001ELR|5.0|Despite the fact that \\"Creatures of the Night\\" has been created in a very turbulent moment for Kiss, with a new (and amazing) drummer and a team of guitarists to replace Ace Frehley (his only participation on \\"Creatures...\\" was the picture of the cover), it sounds really heavy metal and agressive. No other Kiss album is as punchy as \\"Creatures...\\". In my opinion, \\"Creatures...\\" is the best way to close an era (\\"the masked years\\") and begin another (\\"the hair metal years\\", starting with \\"Lick it Up\\"). 100% recomended.
B001TODCII|4.0|I thought this was a really good action film! Everybody did an awesome job. This movie is like Max Payne, 24, and Commando all mixed together in one movie!

Filled to the brim with action and suspense, I highly recommend TAKEN!!!

B000001ESJ|5.0|I bought Rush's 1977 release \\"A Farewell to Kings\\" just last month, and I've really been listening to it alot since then, it's just simply amazing, I really love it. Rush have really become one of my favorite progressive rock bands lately, they're also one of the best bands in rock period. I own eight Rush albums (including their 1974 self-titled debut, Fly By Night, Moving Pictures, 2112, Permanent Waves, Presto, and Counterparts), and I've become a bigger fan of Rush with each album that I listen to, and \\"A Farewell to Kings\\" is definately an acception, no questions asked. This album is just absolutely brilliant from start to finish, and it's also Rush's strongest and best album from the 70's in my opinion. Their breakthrough release from 1976 \\"2112\\" is an outstanding album, as well as one of the band's best, but it's this album that takes Rush's sound to a whole new different level of pure progressive musical brilliance, and it also shows the band at their peak as well. This album is also the first to feature the use of synthesizers, which really add to the band's progressive sound.<br /><br />The production on here is once again handled by Terry Brown, and his producing never fails. Frontman Geddy Lee's trademark high ranged vocals are top notch as always, and his bass playing is just totally unreal and amazing. I know that I've said it before in some of my previous Rush reviews here, but Geddy is definately one of rock's all time best bassists, no questions asked. He also uses Mini-Moog and bass-pedal synthesizers as well, and they really add to the progressiveness of the album here as I mentioned before. Alex Lifeson is an awesome guitarist, and he's also been regarded as one of rock's most underrated guitarists, and I really find that to be a shame, but he's awesome nonetheless. His riffs are just awesome and his solos are even better especially on \\"Closer to the Heart\\" and the 11 minute epic \\"Xanadu\\", and he also experiments with classical and twelve string guitars as well. Neil Peart's drumming is just outstanding and breathtaking and perfectly timed throughout. His percussioning is also diversified on here as he adds different kinds of percussion including cowbells, orchestra bells, wind chimes, triangle, bell tree, vibra-slap, tubular bells, and temple blocks. His is simply without a doubt one of rock's greatest drummers of all time, and when it comes to writing lyrics, this guy truly takes the cake.<br /><br />There are only six songs on AFTK, but hey, I'm not going to complain, seeing that they're all awesome, so let's check them out shall we. The opening title track starts off with a nice peaceful acoustic guitar intro until going into a hard rocking barrage that features excellent riffing and soloing, powerful basswork and drumming, and strongly executed vocals, all before ending with an acoustic outro, while track two \\"Xanadu\\" is a phenomenal 11 minute sci-fi/fantasy epic that is lyrically based on Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poem \\"Kubla Khan\\". This is my personal favorite song on this album. Words just cannot even describe how much I love this song. It's also one of my favorite Rush songs as well. The first five minutes of this song is instrumental which features some nice atmospheric synths and wind chimes until Alex cuts in with a cool, addicting melodic guitar riff which is later followed by more heavier muscular riffage, sharp basslines, and fantastic drumwork. Geddy's vocals finally come into play around the 5 minute mark with these great opening lyrics: \\"To seek the sacred river Alph, to walk the caves of ice, to break my fast on honey dew, and drink the milk of paradise...\\" Neil's drumming is just fantastic throughout, and Alex's riffing is just catchy and mindblowing, and there's a sweet, killer guitar solo from him around 9:32 before going into an addicting epic finale. This song is definately an epic that you must hear to believe. Next up, we have \\"Closer to the Heart\\" which is the album's big hit single, as well as a favorite among Rush fans that features a great acoustic intro, along with great vocals from Geddy, and a fantastic guitar solo by Alex to boot.<br /><br />The next song \\"Cinderella Man\\" (which was written by Geddy) is a great, catchy guitar driven rocker that boasts a nice and catchy sing-a-long chorus that has some nice acoustic guitar backing it up, and there's also some killer thumping bass work by Geddy as well. This is another great song I thought. Next up, track five \\"Madrigal\\" is a short but dreamy, mellow acoustic piece that leads up to the incredibly unpredictable 10+ minute sci-fi epic \\"Cygnus X-1\\" which is written in three movements. It lyrically tells of an astronaut's journey through outer space into the black hole of the constellation known as Cygnus. The song starts off with a cool digitized speech and creepy droning synth effects, and before you know it, you are in for one serious hard rocking thrillride. The band's musicianship is just absolutely jaw-dropping, madly insane, and off the hook throughout this song. The riffs are massively heavy and muscular, the bass just thumps like crazy, the time signatures are outstanding, Neil's drumming is just incredible and it's some of his most complexed and madly insane on here, and of course Geddy really lets loose with some sweet, out of control wails near the end. This is definately without question one of the most insane sounding songs that Rush have ever written, and one of their best songs as well.<br /><br />Favorite songs: ALL OF THEM OF COURSE!!<br /><br />Overall, \\"A Farewell to Kings\\" is definately one of Rush's best and most important albums in their catalog, and it's also their strongest and best album from the 70's era as I said earlier, and this is coming from a guy who enjoys listening to Amon Amarth, Death, Atheist, Behemoth, Origin, Nile, Deicide, Cannibal Corpse, Meshuggah, Suffocation, Decapitated, etc. I've always been a fan of classic/progressive rock as well, and Rush are truly one of the best I've ever heard in my life. If you're new to Rush, AFTK would really be a great album to start with along with Moving Pictures (1981), Permanent Waves (1980), and 2112 (1976). If you're already a fan of Rush like I'am, then by all means I highly recommend this classic progressive rock/metal masterpiece. Trust me, it does good justice to a classic album like this. Enjoy!!a favorite among Rush fans that features a great acoustic intro, along with great vocals from Geddy, and a fantastic guitar solo by Alex to boot.

B000003TA9|5.0|This album was an amazing listen. every song was full of energy. this album redeemed sonic youth for me after buying \\"a thousand leaves\\" which had a lot of slower instrumental type of stuff. This album however had nothing but upbeat listenable material. they did a great cover of \\"nic fit\\" by the untouchables who are one of the least known dischord records bands of the early years. In my opinion it's even better than \\"daydream nation\\" which most people say is the best. This is a perfect album for someone wanting to check out sonic youth.

He helps his latest client, an accountant, make the women of his dreams fall in love with him. However while he is helping him, Will Smith gets in touch with a journalist and fall for her, but his techniques do not work on her. Eventually in the movie, he realizes that the best way to get women to like you is to simply be yourself.     Whats nice and new about this movie is all the practical tips given on how to impress a women. Things that you might not have ever thought about before and after this movie you realize, oh that makes sense.      The movie is fine, with few funny scenes. Not hilarious enough though!

B001AII4RM|4.0|Cool movie.  Saw it in 3-D back when it came out.  I would have given it a 5 had it been in 3-D.  As far as Beowulf goes. Where do I start.  Well I'll say that watching Beowulf in action made me question my own machismo.  He strips naked infront of a woman to fight Grendel only because it would make it a fair fight.  He literally yelled at a man who was trying to kill him to do so and the man broke down in tears because Beowulf was way too much man to kill. Beowulf simply told his right hand man to give him some gold and that he now has a story to tell. Any man that is willing to lose an arm to kill anything is much more of a man than myself.  Beowulf is the only character in history to kill something and give him self a shout out.  Simply amazing.      If you like action, and maybe need a few laughs, and wtf moments.  This movie is for you.

B001PPLKI0|4.0|I prefer posting long in-depth reviews as seen on the Elvis Information Network. But here is a short review.      Discs 1 to 3 on \\"I Believe - The Gospel Masters\\" feature Elvis' non-secular studio Master recordings in chronological order from his four key religious releases, the `Peace In The Valley' EP plus the albums `His Hand In Mine,' `How Great Thou Art,' and `He Touched Me.' Elvis' three main Gospel recording sessions used very different arrangements and had a very different feel, so collating each era onto individual CDs works very well.    Surprise inclusions on Disc 3 might be the first two tracks 'I Was Born About Ten Thousand Years Ago' and 'Life' - and the real surprise omission is `Miracle Of The Rosary' from 1971. (Certainly a mistake- or was it? See EIN full review)    Disc 4 gathers up Elvis' other Gospel and Inspirational recordings from his movies, the 68' Comeback TV special, other live performances and home recordings. It is an interesting selection and it flows very nicely compared to the similar concept of the final CD of the `Peace In The Valley' compilation. It includes `Down By The Riverside/When The Saints Go Marchin' In' (from Frankie And Johnny), `Sing You Children' (from Easy Come, Easy Go), a fabulous new mix of the `Swing Down, Sweet Chariot' (from The Trouble With Girls) and `Let Us Pray' (from Change of Habit).     The audio remastering by Vic Anesini (`Viva Las Vegas', `Elvis Live') is top-notch with the opportunity now to appreciate every nuance of these all-important sessions. The sound quality is similar to the great work on the `Close Up' box-set with a real richness and full bass sound. Vic Anesini did similar impressive audio work on the earlier `Ultimate Gospel'  so fans who already purchased that will no doubt be enthusiastic to get all these Gospel songs in such magnificent sound.     Of real interest to collectors will be the fact that `Swing Down, Sweet Chariot' here is a very different mix. From the very start it is TheBlossoms female vocal group that take the lead and follow Elvis' vocal throughout. On the previous version - which is the same Elvis vocal track - it has always been The Mello Men doing these gospel backing-vocals.   In Jorgensen's book `A Life In Music' it states that The Blossoms were only there for a vocal overdub on `Clean Up Your Own Backyard' but maybe they also overdubbed this number too. Whatever the reason this track is a real highlight.      Finally as stated in the sleeve notes  \\"Despite all the millions of sales and the three Grammy Awards, what towers in importance is the timeless music Elvis left behind. Church music, inspirational, hymns or gospel - the labels meant nothing to him. As with everything he ever sang, Elvis merged all the elements into his own belief of what music should be, free of any constraints of genre. Elvis' religious music afforded him more creative freedom than any other music he made, as no one had the knowledge to challenge him, and no one dared. \\"    Overall Verdict: This is a quality BMG release with a nice booklet and four well-selected CDs of the best of Elvis' Gospel sessions and at a very reasonable price. The 8-page essay looking at Elvis' early musical influences and his Gospel sessions is of interest and splitting Elvis' sessions into these 4 individual eras works very well. The improvement in sound gives the songs a rich and warm feel, which suits the delicious gospel harmonies. Disovering a different version of the 1968 'Swing Down, Sweet Chariot' will be of real interest to hard-core collectors.   Of course if you did purchase the individual BMG Gospel album re-releases of last year then it is only the upgraded forth CD that you need here. However if your Elvis budget is limited and like me you couldn't afford those at the time then this is the perfect package.   (For the full review please go to the Elvis Information Network [...])
B001LF4IA6|1.0|Lyrics? really are nonsense rambling.  The Cd was probably written during a dream and it flows like a dream sequence on the Soprano's.    Production? nothing less than what you would expect from Bruce, a real dream.    Value?  save a few bucks and write your own songs then follow your own dream and record them.
0312427646|5.0|Amusing and thought-provoking, with a wicked twist at the end. What happens when Her Majesty (accidentally) discovers reading? Of course, she has always read - Cabinet documents and the like - but not books! Reading (in fact having any hobby) represents preference and her advisers are dead against that. Not to speak of the difficulty they now have of keeping to schedules, and orchestrating those meet and greets. It used to be so easy - she would ask people where they came from, how long it took and how they travelled - now, she is quizzing them on Genet and Proust and all sorts of things - and lending books!<br />The character of the Queen is a delight - smart, witty, sharply observant, and quite ruthless in her charming subtle way...<br />Alan Bennett's writing style is a work of art - each word, each character is perfect. Very easy to read, but full of depth and thought.

0515141429|4.0|My first Jack Reacher encounter!<br />Absolutely loved the beginning of the book - one of the most intriguing and mysterious and amusing starts to a book in a long time. Then things got real complicated real fast.<br />Lee Child handles the mystery and pace just perfectly - it is not a book you put down easily, because you want to read just one more page.<br />Putting in some romance and some interesting characters like the old time barbers is a great touch.<br />Be warned - it is definitely violent.<br />But if you like your main man to be street wise and strong, to get things done, but to have a vulnerable side, then this is for you.
B001TH16DI|5.0|Despite what some are saying, this new Blu-Ray collection of all 6 original cast Star Trek movies really rocks!  Each movie pops off the screen in crystal clear high def and 7.1 sound. Colors are rich and vibrant and the detail is impeccable. You've never seen these films in all their glory as you will in this new collection.  The best they've ever looked.  A must have for all Star Trek fans!
0374139563|4.0|This book is a must read for anybody who has ever donated to an African cause or is thinking about giving a donation to any third world country.  Although our hearts are in the right place the money isn't doing want we hoped it would do!  It is actually prolonging their plans to be \\"aid free\\" in most cases.  I even heard Bono and Clooney say the same thing that the author of this book is trying to get across to the main population.  The author seems to state the facts over and over again in a slightly different situation, but it is a very complex issue to have to deal with. I will definitely change the way I choose to help out next time.  That part is easy!
B001E2JNA6|5.0|I FOUND THIS MOVIE VERY REFRESHING IT MAKES YOU WANT TO GO BACK IN TIME AND EXPERIENCE THE INNOCENT OF COURTSHIP AND UNSPOKEN LOVE BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN. WHILE WATCHING THIS MOVIE YOU ENTER INTO THEIR WORLD AND BECOME A PART OF IT.  I COULD WATCH THIS MOVIE OVER AND OVER. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMENDED IT TO EVERYONE YOU WANT BE DISAPPOINTED.  TO KNOW THAT A WORLD ACTUALLY EXSISTED IN A TIME WE CAN ONLY GRASP FROM A TIMELY MOVIE AS THE PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. THANK YOU JANE AUSTEN FOR SEEING INTO THE FUTURE AND THE PRODUCERS AND DIRECTORS WHO BROUGHT IT TO LIFE.
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|As far as the serires goes, the fourth series has brilliant acting, excellent story lines and amazing chemistry. You would think Tennant and Tate were actually best friends. The Wasp and the Unicorn is the best Doctor Who episode for humor and the Forest of the Dead/Silence in the Library episode is emotionally intense and brilliantly creative. The acting and script are amazing for nearly every episode. (The final episode leaves you a little depressed, though.)  As for the DVD set, the only downside is there are not a lot of video diaries on this set (because, according to Tennant, he didn't make any more). Oh well.  It does include lots of deleted scenes, the Christmas Special and the Children in Need special (between Martha leaving and \\"hitting\\" the Titanic).  If you like Doctor Who, this is the season to own!

B00192KCQ0|4.0|Review no. 953. Whew! Cannot remember the last time I heard a new Metallica release this good. Much better that their previous effort 'St.Anger'. Ten solid modern-day (sort to speak) head-banging classics to fully take in here. Tunes I couldn't get enough of were \\"The End Of The Line\\", the heavy-hitting \\"Broken, Beat & Scarred\\", \\"The Judas Kiss\\" and the awesome \\"My Apocalypse\\". Saw Metallica this last fall with support band Down. All I have to say is that I was glad to hear the guys playing a number of these tunes off this latest CD. Keep up the good work.

B0000A7W14|5.0|I saw this movie when it came out!  I loved it and was scared of it at the same time. It was soo raw & gritty about a lifestyle I knew nothing about.  All these years later it has only gotten better with age. And I really loved the behind the scenes interviews.

B000NTPDSW|4.0|Movies: GF1 is a very solid movie, exceptional in every way. It stays very close to the book. The final moments of the film are breathtaking. 10/10. I liked GF2 better than a first film. I found the story to be more interesting. The whole corruption plot in both family ties and in business world really engaged me in the story. The final moments of the film hold the same power as it's precedor's climax but the flashback endings wasn't very well edited in my opinion. 10/10. GF3 has a very big potential. Unfortunately I did not agree with F.Coppola's decision regarding the whole concept of the film. He was focusing too much on a family values, which did not really satisfy me or most of the other viewers. IMO PartIII should've been a strong finish based more on business. However, the ending of the film is very very very powerful and dramatic, the best in the Trilogy. 9/10     Video Quality: Overall transfer is nice. Grain is still in effect, but the picture definitely looks sharp (In most cases) and HD quality is visible. Unfortunately not all scenes been fully transfered, take for example the scene from GF3 when Mary takes a pictures at train station - poor quality. 8/10     Audio: I appreciate the uniqeness of the transfer, but not completely satisfied with it. Most of the time I found myself with remote control adjusting the sound volume. In some cases it's too loud, in some cases it's too soft. 7.5/10    Overall I'm very satisfied with this product. All 3 films are very powerful and touching. The packaging and blu-ray casing are nicely designed aswell. Great price!
B00007M5CO|5.0|This group is absolutely FANTASTIC, I love their most recent CD MAR DULCE, so  decided to purchase their previous one. It has a bit more techno than accordion (which I love) but it has not disappointed me at all ! It is worth every penny.  Highly RECOMENDED!  Enjoy!  Disfrutenlo!
B001C3KCSY|5.0|Best one so far. Their hit \\"Sex On Fire\\" isn't even close to the best song!!
B001NFNFIK|3.0|Why isn't this a better movie? Bertrand Tavernier, awesome French director with a ton of really great movies under his belt. Tommy Lee Jones, the absolute perfect actor for a Louisiana policeman. John Goodman, the perfect pig of a criminal. Ned Betty as a slimy owner of a sugar factory. Buddy Guy, my goodness, blues legend BUDDY GUY. The backdrop of the aftermath of Katrina. The list just goes on and on.<br /><br />What went wrong? There's no blues music in this movie, except for one party scene. Why in the world wasn't Buddy Guy used to advantage (he's a horrible actor by the way)? The editing is a terrible mess. There are montages that are perfectly constructed, they leave the viewer guessing or wondering what will happen next. There are some that leave out massive details and expect the viewer to fill in, nice effect when done properly (assumes an intelligent audience). Then there is the bulk of the film, edited straight like a melodrama. The voice over narration works for a time, but the technique gets lost and way under used. It's jarring anytime it returns.<br /><br />The worst part of the film, there's a sort of happily ever after ending to a fairly dark movie. There's no real need to know what each character is doing later in life.<br /><br />What was well done - Tommy Lee Jones. Since he is 95% of the film, he plays his role to perfection and is compelling. The cinematography is mostly very well done (there's a few hand held shots that look like reshoots that were poor at best). The dialog is generally clear.<br /><br />The mystery itself is middle of the road. For murder mysteries to work, there has to be fortelling of who did it. The viewer has to have some kind of clues or chance in a million to figure out the murder. All seems very well in this film, the first murder solution progresses along. Then the old murder and a couple of new ones are added. The mystery starts to make less and less sense. It turns needlessly convoluted forcing the viewer to thin, well just tell me already, I'm tired of trying to figure this out. So once the murder is revealed, it's a major let down.<br /><br />The DVD is sparse, film, preview, plus the theatrical trailer. Rated R, but I have no real good clue why it got an R rating. There was one really stupid moment of female nudity for 10 seconds. The film is somewhat violent, there are a number of fights. There isn't any really strong language. A younger mature viewer could see this film easily.<br /><br />Read the novel, don't read the novel? I don't care for that question at all. A film stands on it's own. It's a good film, no matter the book. If a person has to read the book to understand the film, that film is a failure.I'm tired of trying to figure this out.

B001GSV3EC|5.0|This album is sooo much fun. One of the best live rock/jazz performances available!! Treat your ears...play it loud. Vinnie Colaiuta-Drums, Jason Rebello-keyboards, and Tal Wilkenfeld-Bass are the perfect complement. A great selection of songs including many favorites like \\"Cause We've Ended As Lovers\\" by Stevie Wonder and \\"Led Boots\\" by Maxwell Middleton...and a surprise cover of \\"A Day In The Life\\" by Lennon/McCartney. If you're already a fan, you'll love this. If you aren't one yet, listen twice, you may become one.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|Occasionally a TV drama comes along that makes you regret using 5 stars on something else, just so you can say this one is that much better.  This is one of those!  From start to end, we are presented with a compelling drama, which is not only reeks of authenticity (though of course, what do I know - I'm not an historian..) but is an absorbing portrayal of a couple in love, a family in motion, and the birth of a nation.  Paul Giamatti is simply superb casting to play John Adams - a man who is not portrayed as charismatic or `pretty' but clever, sincere, moral and committed.  Events start with the Boston Massacre, leading up to the Boston Tea Party, the War of Independence (unseen for the most part since Adams spent most of the time in Europe), the drafting of the Constitution and of course his term as the second president of the United States, before his retirement years.  It's not told as a simplistic TV movie of the week triumph in hard times, but is told as a well rounded look at the man through fascinating historical times.  Some victories, some defeats, some frustrations, but most of all the relationships with people he knew.  Most fascinating of these was his wife Abigail, portrayed in definitive form by the ever adaptable Laura Linney.  It seems the story of one is equally the story of the other, so intertwined are their stories.  And then there are other supporting cast members, David Morse as Washington, Stephen Dillane as Thomas Jefferson and Tom Wilkinson having a blast as Benjamin Franklin.    Events are never told with rose colored glasses.. this is warts and all, and even handed, showing Adam's frustrations and bitternesses as well as his successes, and indeed also the country's sometimes ugly birth pangs as it discovers its identity.  There is little in the way of big budget battle scenes, the battles are for the most part off screen. And yet despite often being a talking heads exercise, the canvas seems writ large, giving the impression at times thatwe really are looking through a window to the times, rather than a cleaned up portrayal of it.    Recommended, for both those interested in a pivotal time in history, and those interested in the development of a fascinating character and those around him.
B002436WJE|5.0|When I was a soldier stationed in Germany in the 1970s there was a raid on a Turkish-owned bar on the outskirts of Frankfurt A/M. German Polizei and US CID (US Army Criminal Investigation Division) broke up a white slavery ring that had been operating out of the bar for some time. The bar was a way-point in the transportation route of young European girls (preferably blonde) who had been kidnapped throughout Europe and were being smuggled to be sold in the harems and brothels of the Middle and Far East. The police found some twenty girls in the basement of the bar, some from as far away as Denmark and the Netherlands, waiting to be shipped further down the pipeline.    The German police and Interpol had been watching the bar for some time and were hoping to trace the route farther down the track to take down the ringleaders. The white slavers made the mistake of kidnapping the daughter of a US Army colonel whom they thought was a German national. The Colonel learned about the investigation and refused to allow his daughter to be held by the white slavers and victimized so the police could gather intelligence. As it turned out, I learned later, the raid eventually did lead to the disruption of this particular ring because the guys busted talked.    So, when I learned what this film was about I went in with a certain amount of understanding of the subject matter. Let me say here that this film hits the nail on the head in presenting its subject matter and the way young women are victimized by ruthless animals only out to make a buck. (SPOILER) The scenes where they show the young women being made into drug addicts to control them are particularly disturbing to me as I've seen the impact drugs had on young girls working as unlicensed street walkers in Germany (a nation that legalized prostitution to make it \\"safe\\").  As disturbing as the film was I am glad I watched it and if I had a daughter (I had all sons) I would make her watch this film when she reached an appropriate age in hopes it would make her more careful in how she behaved when I wasn't around to protect her. This is a film every parent should watch - it is a film every teenaged girl and boy should watch. It's sad, but things like what happens to the girls in this movie go on every day.    Having said that, the next question is, is the movie good?    Well, I've never seen Liam Neeson deliver a bad performance. Even if I didn't like the movie (and he's done a couple turkeys) he has always been superb. No exception here. Sadly, most of the negative comments about this film seem to be from people who don't like action movies. But Neeson elevates this even above the typical action movie. This is a story of family. When I watched Neeson's reaction to what happens to his daughter and his response I imagine it is what Natalie Holloway's daddy wishes he could have done, what every father of a child who has been abducted and brutalized wish they could do.    As a professional soldier and former martial arts instructor I find Neeson's action scenes are superbly executed and realistic. Don't look for a superhero leaping tall buildings with a single bound, but watch an expert, who may not be as young as he once was, doing what he knows best for a good cause. The fights are brutal, ruthless, and efficient, pros doing what they do. Even the violence is understated, brutal, but avoids the spectacular many audience have come to expect. What Neeson does is violent but considering the circumstances and motivation, necessary to save his girl. Great stuff.    The alleged coincidences do not strain or insult the intelligence overmuch, this is an action movie for folks who think.  Of course, if you thought \\"The English Patient\\" deserved the Best Picture Oscar you'll probably hate this film. Otherwise, it is a don't miss. Neeson brings to the revenge flick empathy and gravitas lacking in other such films.     As I watched the film I thought of that Army colonel fighting Interpol and the German police to save his daughter. I hope he was able to see this film, I think he'd approve.

B001FB4VZS|3.0|okay guys my yearly review of Smallville.  THis season had some major strong points this, most notably Sam Witwer as Davis Bloome, and Erica Durance as Lois Lane.  But other than that it was an ehhhh season    Season 8    1. Odyessy:  Strong opener, but could have given us a whole lot more.   2. Plastique.  SO so so lame  3. Toxic: Great episode, we learned how Oliver became the Green Arrow  4. Insticnt:  Avg. episode.    5. Committed: Another avg. episode  6. Prey:  So so so lame  7. Identity: Great episode, Jimmy Olsen does he learn the true identity of Clark??  8. Bloodline:  Perhaps the best episode of the season: Clark and Lois end up in the Phantom Zone.   9. Abyss:  Good episode: Has Chole forgotten everyone in her life except for Davis?  10. Bride: Great episode. Do Chloe and Jimmy have a happy wedding. Is that Lex?  11. Legion:  Ehhh episode, Some good parts and some bad parts  12. 13. 14.  The worst episodes EVER! Dont even deserve a description  15. Infamous: Great episode, Has the world found out Clarks secret  16.  Turbulence: Avg. Episdoe: Has Tess figured out Clarks secret?  17.  Hex: Good episode, A magician Grants Choles wish  18.  Eternal:  Good episode, but kind of changes the Superman background  19.  Stileto:  People either loved or hated this episode. I was not a fan  20.  Beast: Avg episode.  Could have given us so much more  21.  Injustice:  Okay episode. Is Tess good or evil?  22.  Doomsday: I say it is avg.  Very disappointing in parts.  Kind didnt give us much for a finale.  The fight with Clark and Doomsday.  Lasted 1 minute.      So to sum it up.  Tough year.  Dont forget about those 3 episodes that I didnt even give credit to.      Tell me your thoughts?? Do you agree? Disagree?      I will still buy the season, but will be skimming through a lot of it

It will take you into a descent into a hell full of shadows where the light will never touch you.<br /><br />This is a classic dark tale of intrigue. It is filled with the depths to which the human condition can sink. It is a page turner, but it may leave you feeling empty at the end. That is what it did for me. Nevertheless, it is a haunting book that is well worth reading.

B001HN697M|5.0|RISE OF THE LYCANS, like its predecessors, is another slickly made movie (which looks and sounds great in the disc's 2.40:1 widescreen and Dolby Digital 5.1 presentation) that is, once again, heavy on the digital FX, but its simple ROMEO AND JULIET/SPARTACUS story works in its favor. Like EVOLUTION, it explores the Lycan-vampire history, but unlike the second movie, RISE isn't impeded by unnecessary overcomplications and entanglements.With Selene (Kate Beckinsale) and Michael's (Scott Speedman) story concluded in EVOLUTION, RISE OF THE LYCANS goes back in time to tell another tale of interspecies amour that causes conflict between the warring tribes. This time, the forbidden love is between Lucian (Sheen) and Sonja (DOOMSDAY's Rhona Mitra, looking very Beckinsale-ish). You may recall from the prior films that Lucian is the Lycan leader who fought against the vampires and their chieftain, Viktor (Bill Nighy), who is also Sonja's father. RISE takes place during the \\"Dark Ages,\\" in which Viktor and the coven reside in a castle where enslaved werewolves protect them during the day; the bloodsuckers also have a deal with their human neighbors in which they defend them from the wild creatures in the woods. Lucian is Viktor's favored slave, and the first Lycan (humans who can change into beasts and vice versa). But when Viktor learns of Lucian's love for Sonja, he imprisons Lucian and uses him to create a new line of Lycan slaves. This heightens Lucian's animosity toward his vampire rulers and ignites him to lead a SPARTACUS-esque Lycan revolt.Patrick Tatopoulos (the creature designer and supervisor on the other UNDERWORLDs) took over the directing reigns here from Len Wiseman, who served as one of RISE's producers. The pair are joined by producers Richard Wright and Gary Lucchesi and executive producer James McQuaide on the disc's audio commentary--which, given Tatopoulos' background, unsurprisingly places the emphasis on the various practical and visual FX and how they were used throughout the film. The discussion is of the adequate sort that I've come to expect from most DVD talk tracks. One thing you learn is that the movie was initially going to start off with the plague's origin and Corvinus' story, but that had to be cut for budgetary reasons. The group also spends a good deal of time talking about how RISE connects with the other films and the importance of making sure this prequel properly and legitimately tied in with them.Why Wiseman vacated the director's chair and how Tatopoulos was chosen as his replacement is one of the behind-the-scenes topics covered in UNDERWORLD: RISE OF THE LYCANS: From Script to Screen. This featurette runs only nine minutes, but also covers shooting the movie in New Zealand, the visual FX and how the filmmakers sought to make a bigger sequel on a smaller budget. The Origin of the Feud explores the beginnings of the popular Richard Dawson-hosted game show... Actually, this 20-minute segment concentrates on why the filmmakers wanted UNDERWORLD's backstory to be the \\"forestory\\" in this entry; it also breaks down the film's major characters and interviews the actors who played them. Production design is a highlight of the UNDERWORLD series, so it's only appropriate that Dan Hennah's contributions are praised in Re-creating the Dark Ages: The Look of UNDERWORLD: RISE OF THE LYCANS. The talking heads here discuss the werewolf suits, CGI and sets--most importantly the vampire castle, whose Romanesque, 11th-century design is a departure from the Gothic architecture on view in the earlier movies.UNDERWORLD fans will probably appreciate this prequel more than the average moviegoer.were used throughout the film.

B00005214X|4.0|I really wish Harrison would have put out a remixed version of this CD before he died. He said he was tempted to remix every track. The songs are great but the production is overdone with way too much echo.
B001N26GFM|4.0|This film exemplifies 1 Corinthians 1:27-28:  \\"God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong...the lowly things and despised things...to nullify the things that are.\\"  The injustice and subtle irony of opulence and security versus utter poverty and persecution existing side by side is all to plain for the movie viewer to see.  The film serves as a powerful reminder of how pride and arrogance can lead us on the dangerous path to total ignorance and acceptance of ideology that embodies a gross distortion of God's word and wisdom for how we are to lead godly lives and treat our fellow man.  The ending, though a fittingly tragic consequence of man's folly  and certainly not unforeseen, was a little too abrupt in my opinion, and the film dialogue overall was frequently difficult to understand due to the British accent of actors in the film.  Because of the heavy and depressing subject matter, I would caution parents to consider the emotional maturity of their children before exposing them to the film.

But if it's on the 360, I can actually enjoy the game with a controller that has won awards for its ergonomic design.<br /><br />Let's face it, when the PSOne came out, it was the best damn controller on the market, especially compared to the bizarro monstrosities Nintendo's thrown at us. PS2 was even better, for it's time. I say this because the original XBox controller was unnecessarily HUGE and garish.<br /><br />But now, with the sleek style and comfort of the 360 controller, the PS3 controller (dualshock 3 or sixaxis alone) is clearly a bit archaic, and a PAIN considering how far under the bottom of the controller they decided to tuck the L2 and R2 buttons, curving both down and inward; really, your middle finger pressed all the way down on that baby is going to have your knuckle bent more than 90 degrees just to get a response on screen! With the rest of your fingers working diligently to both hold on to the controller for dear life, and to press all the buttons needed, it kinda sucks.<br /><br />That is the problem RealTriggers aims to fix. They snap on, stay on, and hook upward to catch your finger when you go the press the button just like the 360 does, meaning that you no longer feel like your finger is going to slip right off the button.<br /><br />My only real complaint is that they perhaps stay on too well--I can't get them off, which is fine by me, but I can imagine some people would want the choice.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

0307346617|5.0|I picked this book up on a half impulse, half a co-worker recommended it. I was not disappointed. Now I do also own the 'Zombie Survival Guide' by the same author and also available here on Amazon. (Another interesting read.) Reading this book proved difficult because I couldn't put it down!<br /><br />As a fan of the zombie genre at large I was, at first, apprehensive of Max Brooks' style of lumbering and lethargic zombies. However as the book progressed I saw his reasons for making the G's (as they're called in the book) the way they were. Max explains it well in his writing.<br /><br />The book takes place twelve years AFTER the end of the zombie war. The writer (an alternate universe Max Brooks) goes in search of survivors of the Z-War and their individual stores. Each story is compelling and in many ways frightening to read. Some survivors are former big-business owners now lowered to shoveling manure, traumatized teens, former military, clergy, and even astronauts (a very sad story that).<br /><br />But what surprised, and outright horrified, me the most was not the zombies...<br /><br />Brooks has a moral to this book. A revelation that asks: What if we were to go up against an enemy that could be ANYONE? What if we couldn't put a face or a nickname on the enemy? How would we have to change our tactics to combat our enemy? How would we respond, as a species, to an enemy that had virtually endless numbers and required no resources to go against us? How would we respond to an enemy that will not eat, will not sleep, will not STOP until we're all destroyed? Indeed, all are very realistic and very very scary concepts.<br />The scariest enemy we'll face in the war against the zombie hordes will be each other.<br /><br />This book takes my #4 spot of my \\"Top 5 Favorite Books\\". A perfect 10!<br />Buy it! You'll love it, I guarantee it!

0375842209|5.0|\\"The Book Thief \\" is one of the best novels I have read. Truly! Author Markus Zusak's storyline is both sad and wonderful, as it deals with Germany during WWII and the Holocaust. His memorable characters have tremendous depth, and the plot is extremely original. However, what makes this book so extraordinary is the author's writing, which, at times, is more poetry than prose. I frequently found myself reading passages of the elegantly written narrative aloud.<br /><br />Appropriately for the times, Death is our narrator and a major character. Death, the \\"gatherer of souls,\\" writes of himself, \\"I do not carry a sickle or scythe. I only wear a hooded black robe when it's cold. And I don't have those skull-like facial features you seem to enjoy pinning on me from a distance. You want to know what I really look like? I'll help you out. Find yourself a mirror while I continue.\\" In the Prologue, Death states, \\"Here is a small fact: you are going to die. Does that worry you? I urge you - don't be afraid. I'm nothing if not fair.\\" The figure describes himself as amiable, even affable, but warns, \\"don't ask me to be nice. 'Nice' has nothing to do with me.'\\"<br /><br />When the novel begins, Death is gearing up for mass production. It is 1939 and WWII has just begun. By 1945 the entire world will be at war. And it is Death who comments on man's inhumanity to mad, almost without emotion, in as objective a manner as possible. This inhumanity will cause it/him to work 24/7 in various places in the world at once. That's what I call multi-tasking.<br /><br />Nine year-old Liesel Meminger is our protagonist, \\"the book thief,\\" although when we meet her, she is unschooled and cannot read very well. Liesel, her little brother Werner, and their mother are on a train to Munich. All three are skinny and pale, with sores on their lips. It is on the train that Death comes to claim young Werner's soul. Liesel and her mother despair. The boy is buried near the city, and one of the gravediggers, an apprentice, drops a black book as he walks away in the freezing winter weather. Liesel picks up the book, without calling out to notify the gravedigger of his loss. The book is titled, in silver letters, \\"The Gravedigger's Handbook.\\" It is the first book she steals. So much has been taken from her, the grieving child feels like she settles part of the score when she commits the theft. In Munich the girl's mother bids her good-bye and turns her over to a foster care woman. The mother disappears, never to be seen again.<br /><br />Liesel and the woman make their way to a small town, Molching, on the outskirts of Munich, close to the Dachau death camp. They stop at a small house on Himmel Street, where her new foster parents, Hans and Rosa Hubermann, await the little girl. Hans is a kind and loving man who quickly takes to Liesel and visa versa. Rosa is also basically kind, although she puts up a front as a shrewish loudmouth. She is a laundress by trade and Hans is a house painter who loves to play the accordion. He is not a member of the Nazi Party. When he realizes he is losing customers because of his lack of enthusiasm for Hitler and the Nazis, he tries to join but his papers are on permanent hold. Their two children are grown and live away from home.<br /><br />Liesel has terrible nightmares and occasionally wets the bed. Hans, hearing her late night screams, sits with her and comforts her, sometimes until dawn. Occasionally he plays the accordion for her until Rosa yells at him to \\"shut up!\\" The empathetic, kindly man and the traumatized little girl form a close bond and Hans begins to teach Liesel to read, especially as she is fascinated by words. She believes that words have great power, after all, Hitler didn't need guns to persuade the German people to follow him and to hate Jews. He used words.<br /><br />When she begins school and the teacher realizes that the girl can't read, she is placed in a class with younger children. Most humiliating! It is during one of Liesel's frequent nightmares, that Hans begins to teach her to read. Since the Hubers have no books of their own, Hans uses Liesel's \\"The Gravedigger's Handbook.\\" as a teaching tool. Then another book, a copy of \\"Mein Kampf,\\" is acquired, one of the few available books which have not been burned. And yet another book, \\"The Shoulder Shrug.\\" which Liesel snatches from a pile of burning books, is added to her collection. \\"Germans loved to burn things. Shops, synagogues, Reichstags, houses, personal items, books and of course, people.\\"<br /><br />Eventually, Liesel acclimates to her new home and makes friends, especially with Rudy, the boy next door and her biggest fan. She never overcomes her nightmares, however, nor does she ever forget her mother and brother. It is at this time when she is forced to join Hitler Youth.<br /><br />Then Max Vandenberg, a German Jew in hiding, comes to ask Hans to fulfill a promise he made to his father, a comrade in arms who saved Hans' life during WWI. A Jew seeking refuge...what to do? Hans, an honorable man, feels obligated to keep his promise, even though it would mean death for Rosa and himself if Max were discovered in their home. Liesel is sworn to secrecy. The Hubers take the man in and set up living quarters for him in the basement. Max becomes part of the family and forms a close friendship with Liesel. She becomes his eyes and ears to the outside world. He eventually writes a book for her, \\"The Standover Man\\" - a simple, illustrated and haunting book about what it is like to be born Jewish in Hitler's Germany.<br /><br />Life goes on. Liesel learns to read and steals more books - fourteen in all. She and her friends adventure. Germany declares war on Russia. Death's work increases, especially on the eastern front and in the concentration camps. He/it feels overwhelmed by the souls to collect from the camps, gas chambers, battlefields, and causalities from air-raid bombings. Max begins to do crossword puzzles in the old newspapers Liesel occasionally finds for him. Rosa's and Han's workload diminishes significantly. Times are tough, rationing is strict, and people don't have money to send out their laundry or to have their houses painted. And, of course, Hans carries the stigma of not belonging to the Party. I don't want to include any spoilers, so I will stop my summary here.<br /><br />This is a powerful novel that kept me riveted throughout. As I wrote above, I sometimes stopped to read parts of the prose aloud. There is humor here also. One needs comic relief when reading a novel about such a heinous period in mankind's history.<br /><br />Markus Zusak's  parents grew up in Nazi Germany and Austria. He frequently thought of writing about the things his parents had seen during the war.

B000AP04OM|5.0|I loved this movie growing up and now my girls 3 and 4 can't get enough of it. These days it is hard to find a movie even among the so called kids movies that I am willing to let my kids watch. The sound of music and mary poppins are two favorites in our house!
1603090002|5.0|After the diffuse \\"Black Dossier\\", this is a terrific return to form. There were times when it was so good I gasped out loud.<br /><br />The title of this first installment (of three) is \\"What Keeps Mankind Alive?\\", and if that doesn't excite you--if you don't get that he's taking on The Threepenny Opera--then you probably won't get this book at all. The way Moore's \\"Jenny Diver\\" is entangled with that of Brecht is by itself worth the price of admission.<br /><br />The League, such as it is, now consists of three immortals: Mina Murray, Allan Quartermain, and Orlando; plus Thomas Carnacki, the Ghost Finder, and the Gentleman Burglar, A.J. Raffles.<br /><br />I can't say more without spoiling things, alas, but I will mention that the \\"Earl of Gurney\\" who plays a significant (but unseen) role in the denouement is the protagonist of Peter Barnes's brilliant black comedy \\"The Ruling Class.\\"<br /><br />It's not an action comic, and it's not a Hollywood movie. The heroes aren't always central, and they sometimes fail. It's much more like a prose novel, where characters come and go and not everything gets spelled out. Moore's allusions here are less universal than in the first LoEG, but it's worth chasing down the footnotes. (The prose backmatter incorporates parodies of Clarke's \\"2001\\" and Reage's \\"Story of O\\", among other surprises.)<br /><br />I need also to say that this is the best work I ever seen from Kevin O'Neill, which is saying something.
0316017922|5.0|Gladwell's theme is that practice (usually the magic 10,000 hours) and sometimes timing is what separates the great from the rest of us. As a middle school English teacher, I have to say that what he says makes a lot of sense. My kids who read and write the most on their own are the best readers and writers in my class. Gladwell writes in an entertaining manner and comes up with great examples to prove his points. While some of the evidence is selective and anecdotal, he shows trends that simply cannot be ignored. Overall, this is a great read and an eye-opener that may also inspire readers to put more stock in hard work than reyling upon \\"God-given talent\\" or more commonly, blaming shortcomings on lack of talent.
B0015QT78O|5.0|I recorded the show when it was on but the tapes got destroyed.  I REALLY would love them to come out on video.  I even named my cat (that I got while the series was still on) Algiba, which is Starman's home star.  I wish the show had never been cancelled (after only one season) at all. It was a very heart warming story plus a little sad because Starman (Paul Forrester - character) and Scott Hayden are trying so hard to find Jenny.  And finally when they find her, they have to separate again.  I would have liked the series to be continued and when they found Jenny, the three of them would be on the road together as a family.  Even though they are pursued by government agents, still the family would be together.

B001AVEJ1Y|1.0|I am a trekkie or trekker or whatever, meaning I am a fan of the old series/movies, etc.  I am not one of those old trekkies who could not stand to see change or have all my memorized future history go down the toilet.  I liked the new actors, I liked the new ship, the new effects were awesome, I totally dug the Spock Uhuru thing.  The movie is funny, it is engaging, it is an awesome action movie, but it ain't Star Trek, not by a long shot!      The main thing that I loved about Star Trek is the concept that the future was bright.  Very bright.  No racism, no sexism.  The basics of life was provided:  no worrying about healthcare, food, etc.  Heck there wasnt even any money in the future!  Greed, jealousy, hatred was almost non-existent in the original Star Trek universe, not because it was banned, but because the root causes had been so effectively dealt with that no one wanted for anything, and no one was held back from realizing their dream.  To quote Picard, the only challenge in the Star Trek future was \\"to improve oneself and improve one's society.\\"  That philosophy is what made Star Trek the real thing, and attracted the huge numbers of fans.  It certainly wasn't the acting!  (Apologies to Patrick Stuart).  Star Trek was about hope.  It was about how the future will be better than now.  It taught us to believe that humanity can and, more importantly, will do better.  After all if this is the military of the future, imagine what civilian life would be like!     There is no hint of the idealized future that Gene Roddenberry created in this movie.  It was almost as if the director was confused and thought the Star Trek universe was the one from Starship Troopers not Star Trek.  This future reality is grim.  Life isn't fair.  Its not even that good.  The future portrayed in Star Trek (2009) is without hope.  Instead of a captain who tries everything before resorting to violence, Star Trek (2009) gives in to a bloodlusty script and fun special effects.  The storyis forced beyond recognition just to make everyone fit into their old roles.  Was that necessary?  After all it is an alternate universe.  How many cadets jump six pay grades before getting out of the academy?  And then all the items that are impossible to disbelieve -- a space ship that does not enter a planet's atmosphere let alone land on a planet being built on a planet?  A Chief Medical Officer just out of the academy?  (Just to name two of about 1,000).  I can accept a parallel universe where things are the same but different, but this different?  No hint of Roddenberry's idealism?  An alternate reality is still reality (even if it is also a fantasy reality).     Unfortunately, Star Trek did indeed die with Gene Roddenberry and our culture is the worse off for it.  I used to blame Rick Berman, but now I see that a visionary cannot be plucked out of a hat or hired by Paramount to direct a movie.  With this movie's success we can unfortunatley expect more banality out of Paramount, violence for its own sake, and the agonizing mutilation of one man's vision.

B001TOVZYQ|4.0|I was very interested in this movie, having taken Wing Chun in my youth. For the most part they have pretty accurately portrayed the Martial Art style in technique and style, with the exception of some minor acrobatics. As an autobiography of Yip Man, I think they have made some edits to his actual history. But, since this wasn't a documentary, and made as a action movie, I think it's forgivable. I suppose it should be taken as artist liberties, of the movie industry, which doesn't really bother me. Overall it was a very exciting movie whether you've trained in Wing Chun or not.    You can listen to the movie in Cantonese or Mandarin, If you don't speak ether of those languages, an English subtitle is available.

B001PJRAUS|5.0|I found this movie by accident when searching online for Austen books and movies. I watched the trailer that was provided and it looked fascinating.  It was!! It was totally different than anything ever done with an Austen story.  It was very entertaining and even though it was already three hours, I could have watched more.  It was done to entertain and have fun with the story and done well.  We would never want Austen's stories to ever be changed but this was a time travel story for someone who loves Austen's books so much she ended up in one!
0790729652|3.0|When Tim Burton put out Batman in 1989, comic book fans and movie fans alike were pleased with this movie about the caped crusader.  Coming in at 2 hours in length, this was the first \\"modern\\" comic book movie.  Starkly different from the optimistic Superman movies of Christopher Reeves with its bright colors and undercurrents of patriotism and American greatness, Burton's Batman was more of a drama than a comic book come to life.  Good and evil often fought it out at night, in hidden places, away from the press and public.  And so Michael Keaton's Batman set the standard for comic book movies for over a decade until the early 2000's when the Spiderman and X-Men franchises began.<br /><br />Then came Christopher Nolan with Batman Begins and Dark Knight.  Now, comic-book movie fans were treated to the pleasure of two separate, distinctly different movies about the same conflict; Batman versus the Joker.  Therefore, this review of Tim Burton's original Batman is written from the POV of a judge who has seen both Nolan's and Burton's creations and is deciding on the better one.  I will flat out declare that The Dark Knight is a better movie in just about every respect when compared to Batman.  Now here's why.<br /><br />First of, Michael Keaton and Christian Bale portray the same character, but whereas Keaton's dialogue is stiff and stilting, Bale's is reflective, emotive, and more polished; in total a better representation of his character - a wealthy man with many secrets and too many experiences for a person of his age.  This comparison is best illustrated in their respective scenes with their love interest; played by Kim Basinger and Maggie Gyllenhall.  Keaton's dialogue with Basinger is terse, monotonous and ultimately melodramatic, and Basinger's character screams too much.  Contrast this with Gyllenhall's portrayal of Rachel Dawes; a seasoned DA whose balance of personal and professional goals reflects the lives of many modern woman.  The dialogue between Bale and Gyllenhall are serious, introspective, with tinges of melancholy, hope, longing and regret all rolled into one.<br /><br />The soundtrack of this movie is another letdown; no main themes carry the movie.  Instead, we have a series of quirky tones punctuated by a lot of silence.  Contrast this with the Dark Knight which has several musical motifs that drive the suspense and action.<br /><br />Probably the most vivid contrast between the movies is the emphasis on ethics, morals, straw-men scenarios, and conflicts of interest.  Burton's Batman is essentially a comic-book adapted to the big screen, a simple story with some action, some comedy, but no morality plays undergirding it.  Nolan's Dark Knight is the exact opposite; the entire movie is about individuals being put into situations that challenge their morals, ethics, and judgements.  The Dark Knight is a drama set against the backdrop of a comic-book world, and does for comic-book movies what Traffic did for movies about the drug war; i.e. make them deadly serious.  And this difference is driven by the Joker.  In Burton's Batman, the Joker is essentially that, a guy who fools around with people's lives to rouse laughter either in himself or those around him.  Ledger's Joker is an altogether different creature; his evil is purposeful and precise, with the intent to force people to make tough decisions.  This is where the original Batman got overshadowed by the Dark Knight, the Joker's portrayal.<br /><br />So all in all, Keaton's first Batman movie is good, but not great.  Its worth the watch, especially to see the progression of how Hollywood has done comic-book movies.re serious, introspective, with tinges of melancholy, hope, longing and regret all rolled into one.

0590402331|4.0|This is the beginning of an enormously popular series of books.  Each is made up of a chain of fanciful interactions between a child and an animal.  In this one, a boy shares one of his cookies with a mouse, who asks for milk, then needs a straw to drink it with; on giving himself a milk moustache he asks to use a mirror, and on looking in the mirror decides he needs a haircut.  Each subsequent event is more absurd than the last, and the story ends with the mouse asking for a cookie.<br /><br />While not high art, the illustrations are cheerfully, skillfully and whimsically drawn, and they tell the story so that little text is necessary.  There is a level of cultural literacy that is necessary before children can appreciate some of the humor, but there is enough here to appeal to a pretty wide age range, especially children who don't enjoy reading longer stories.  Several from this set are available from the public library or elsewhere with a read-aloud recording, to which are added some funny songs and interesting commentary.
B00004RJ71|5.0|Definitely in the top 5 of my favorite movies.  It is one of those movies that not only do you enjoy watching it for entertainment but you are still thinking about it and the profound emotional impact it has on you days, weeks, even months after you see it.  It is REALLY long though, so that could turn people off to it.  I did not have a problem with it though because of how involved I was in storyline.     I first watched in my one of my classes my senor year of HS.  The teacher was burned out and just spent the last few weeks showing movies and this one was the only one that got the vast majority interested enough to sit still and stay quiet. I never saw anything like it, usually it is 50/50 some watching the others goofing off but at least 80% were captivated each and every day the film was resumed from where we left off.     It is just a great film and it seems like no one knows about it.  I am going to buy it and show it to all of my friends, I suggest you do the same. :)
B0000251VW|3.0|The remastering for this CD is simply horrible. The sound is totally distorted. If you have access to the vynil or even the original CD you'll know what I mean. Otherwise, this CD should deserve five stars. But it is so mangled I can hardly listen to it, unless in a low volume (so it won't distort so much).

B001O2ZW1A|1.0|If you're expecting anything remotely like Porcupine Tree forget it. I love just about everything they have ever done. Now I realize that this isn't a PT album but one could expect to find some over tones between the two. Especially given the fact that Gavin Harrison plays on this album too. Add in Jordan Rudes and Tony Levin, both of whom are stellar musicians, and one would think that you would have the making of something great. Wrong. This sounds like Wilson dropped one too many hits of blotter in an experiment to see if he could fill up a CD with ambient sounds and sell it to the unsuspecting. If you're into long drawn out boring go no where music, give it a shot. Very poor effort indeed.
B001PA0FFO|5.0|\\"Doubt\\" is a well crafted tale of ambiguity, sure to provoke questions and discussion from the viewer.  Is the priest guilty of child molestation?  Is Meryl Streep's character justified in pursuing without proof?  Should there be any grace if neither the boy nor his mother have objections, or if perhaps it was a bond but not a sexual one?  What was the proper action for the priest?  What was the proper action for each of the nuns?  Nominated for five Academy Awards with good reason.  Excellent script, excellent acting, excellent production.
B00005N6KG|5.0|My last pair of these headphones lasted 12 years, until I finally succeeded in destroying them.  These are not fancy, nor do they have spectacular audio quality, but they look nice, they sound nice, and, IMO, they are very well worth the money.
B001PPLIFU|4.0|Once again, Daniel Craig gives a masterful performance as bond. By this film, the Bond character has become very dark, but Craig's performance is subtle enough to human exude some human emotion at the right time. Furthermore, the new \\"bond girl,\\" Olga Kurylenko as Camille, is probably one of the strongest bond girls in the series.    My main concern with this film is the plot. First, unlike most other Bond films, it is a direct sequel to the previous film (\\"Casino Royale\\"). I hadn't realized this and had not watched Royale since it came out, so I did not understand some of the references in this film. Some Royale references (such as Vesper, Bond's love interest) were obvious enough to pick up, but it was only after reading the reviews online that I realized the secret organization in this film, the Quantum, was the direct offshoot of the criminal network in Royale.    Second, \\"Quantum\\" had too much action and too little substantive plot, even for a Bond film. The villain's plot (to obtain a monopoly on water in Bolivia) isn't particularly memorable compared to the plots of past Bond films. There weren't any particularly memorable or classic scenes in the film (such as the poker game in \\"Royale\\"). Ultimately, while the plot itself isn't horrible, and the acting and action scenes are good, the film overall is simply forgettable and doesn't leave me salivating for the next one.

031606792X|5.0|My daughter got the first book as a gift.  I read it and was instantly addicted.  I read the first two books in one day each, then realized it was coming to an end so I forced myself to slow down.   :(   Now that I have finished all four books I hate that I have nothing left.  I'm 32 years old and this is not a teen book as initially thought.  Do yourself a favor and pick up the series.  If you enjoyed the movie the book is 100 times better.
B001C3KCSY|4.0|Only bad thing I can say is the case had a crack in it when I received it; probably due to packaging.    The majority of the songs on the CD are AMAZING. I think there's only one I don't like. That and the crack in the case is the reason for only 4 stars.
B0019LY5IM|5.0|I have been a loyal LOST fan since the beginning, and I must say I think Season 5 will go down as the best season as a whole of all the seasons put together. True, there are still more seasons too go, but I really can't see how the writers & producers could do much better. I hope I am wrong, but I think Lost has hit its peak with Season 5. If you stopped watching lost for any reason this season, pre-order the DVD set for the December 2009 holiday season, and get lost again. This season (Non-Specific Basic Overall Plot Spoiler Now!!!) is very well focused and fine tuned on just a few familiar classic characters with an general emphasis on time-travel so you won't have a problem getting back into the action. Then again, you might get intellectually lost with some profound thought experiences following the drama. What a great show! That is all I will say about season 5. Go get lost again, and pre-order Lost Season 5 for a great price on amazon.com. I will...
B001FB4VZS|4.0|In what I thought was the last season of Smallville actually wasn't and it's coming back for a 9th season next year. Michael Rosenbaum was a solid Lex Luther but I don't blame him for not returning for this season. I mean in his last years all they could think of doing with him was put him with Lana and have him look for a secret group that worshiped Clark. It's too bad that Kristin Kreuk had to make a 4 episode appearance though. I would have much rather have seen Rosenbaum back. The writers have always thought of bad new ways to overuse her character. A 4 episode appearance was a lot more painful than I was hoping for. Hell what was done with her almost made me want to stop watching the show. I'll just say they totally overdid it this time. If you think she has been used bad in the past, no way does it compare to how she was used in just 4 episodes!<br /><br />  While when Lana was gone Chloe managed to get on my nerves this season instead. Sam Witwer plays David Bloome who right away has a huge crush on Chloe. It's silly how she is drawn to him too and how she takes his part over Jimmy and Clark who she has known a lot longer. Oh, plus David Bloome the pretty boy just happens to be Doomsday. That's right, the Doomsday in the comics that killed Superman. Only in Smallville would Doomsday be a pretty boy that has a crush on Chloe lol.<br /><br />  So yeah what was done with Lana was beyond horrible and the Chloe and Doomsday stuff was a bit annoying too. Yet, the season did have plenty of good moments as well. Erica Durance is no doubt 100% Lois Lane this season. She has really become the character and the way Clark and Lois flirt and tease each other was just a delight to watch. Which made it a shame that she was totally pushed to the side and barely even mentioned in 3 of the episodes that Lana was in. Her scenes with Clark beats Clark all depressed saying \\"oh Lana this, oh Lana that\\" any day. Lois and Clark are fun together, Lana and Clark haven't been fun together since god knows when. They are just depressing and boring and I sure the hell hope she's not back in season 9, even if it is a small appearance.<br /><br />  Lana even managed to almost ruin a near solid episode where Legion, a team of heroes come from the future to help Clark. Brainiac has taken over Chloe and they want to kill her and Clark doesn't. It was an awesome episode, that was until the girl in Legion tells Lana that she has a great destiny and Lana has a huge smile on her face like she knows she's all that. It was just painful to watch. Supergirl took a hike just so Lana could be told she has a great destiny ? What the hell ? lol.<br /><br />  I should mention that Lex makes a very small appearance without Rosenbuam playing the part. But a sexy red head named Tess Mercer  (Cassidy Freeman) takes over the Luther mansion and the Daily Planet. She wants to find Lex and also find out everything there is to know about Clark. She also has a history with Oliver Queen (Justin Hartley) since he once saved her life. I liked the addition of her but I do think the show does need Lex back in the last season. It just isn't the last season without him. Especially since he has been better as a villain than any other comic book villain that has made an appearance. Clark's big battles with them never turn out to be much, hell I guess you could hardly even call them big battles. When ever he actually had the guts to stand up to Lex and tell him off, I even found that more satisfying.her since god knows when.

0316044695|5.0|I have just finished this book and not sure I can put anything to words to describe the awe and love I have for Marcus Luttrell and some of the bravest men that have protected our great country.  I'm talking about the men (Marcus's friends\family) that died on Murphy's Ridge and during the rescue..  Marcus if you read this all I can say is that you gave them the greatest respect and love through your story that defines the men they were and that the US Navy Seals have always been and will continue to be.  I appreciated your candor concerning the liberal media and how it contributed to negatively effect the decisions made in war.  Thank you for your love and respect for a great president and your focus throughout the book on God is truly inspiring.  God Bless You brother!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I did not want to put this book down! It touched my heart from the first page to the last. I can't recommend this book highly enough. The author has done a fabulous job putting this together. Wit, wisdom, love, heartbreak and life - this book covers it all. You will never look at your dog the same way again - unless of course, you already knew your dog could talk and that you just couldn't hear. smile.  Thank you Garth Stein!

Although there is practically no 3D eye-candy to speak of, there is definitely more detail throughout the movie versus the DVD version.<br /><br />the DTS-HD audio is definitely better than the DVD audio.<br /><br />However, this reviewed blu-ray does not have the two alternate endings from the extended DVD set, nor the other extras.  :(<br /><br />So if you really like Ronin and own a blu-ray player, i'd recommend waiting for this disc to go on sale for under $20, or get it used.
B001TH16DS|5.0|In September of 1966, Gene Roddenberry's unique vision of the 23rd Century began when the premiere episode of \\"Star Trek\\" hit the airwaves. Mixing drama and sci-fi/fantasy in what was truly cutting-edge storytelling for that time, the show fused ideas of tolerance, loyalty and peace into an exciting adventure with a terrific cast that truly took us on a \\"Wagon Train to the Stars.\\" Now, the classic First Season comes to Blu-ray in a terrific package. The picture and sound quality, while not perfect, is utterly fantastic, while the special features are well-produced. If you're a fan of \\"Star Trek,\\" then you'll definitely want to own this awesome show on Blu-ray. Highly recommended!<br />Program/Blu-ray Grade: A+

B000ALZHUC|4.0|Sodom was never the most technically proficient band in the world, but their enthusiasm, attitude, and knack for writing catchy (if unmelodic) thrash tunes more than made up for their amateurish musicianship.  This early material finds the band at their rawest and most untamed.  For the more nostalgic metalheads out there, this will definitely bring you back to the early days of thrash metal.  For the younger people who never got to appreciate this stuff the first time around, listen to this record and hear how much it influenced all the \\"tr00 elite black metal\\" bands out there.  Regardless of what other bands you listen to, this stuff is fun with a capital FUN.  The songs, particularly \\"Witching Metal\\" and \\"Deathlike Silence\\", never fail to put a big, sloppy grin on my face every time I hear them.    One warning though:  the track listing on the album is incorrect.  \\"Witchhammer\\" is actually the last song, and \\"Volcanic Slut\\" is tenth.
B001QERPDO|4.0|I bought this CD because I heard this band was the next big thing. I was pleasently surprised by one song after the other with no. 5, Breakeven being my absolute fav followed closely by both #4 The Man Who Can't Be Moved and #1 We Cry. No. 10, I'm Yours is beautifully written and performed. Pick up this CD, support this band - they deserve it!
0060254920|5.0|This book is a clasic. I had this for my daughters when they were young, but it had gotten lost. I tried to buy it at a local book store for my grandson now that he is old enought to sit down and have a book read to him and they said they couldn't even order it. I was really happy to find this book and even happier with the condition of the book and the great service I recieved. thank you very much.
B001MEJY8W|2.0|Anyone that finds this film anything but sickening needs help, this is not art as I have read nor is it horror or even a good slasher flick, it's just plain old torture with a twist.<br />That being said, the movie did hold my interest up to a point then it just got stupid. But if you are into sick minded torture be my guest. I've about had my fill of watching this trash, namely; (Frontiers, Hostel, and anything else that involves torturing young girls).<br />Do they really think or hope there will be a sequel to this waste of time?
0060558121|5.0|All of my friends who are readers have read Neil Gaiman. Where have I been? How did I totally miss this guy and this book which was published in 2001. Nevermore! I'm hooked after listening to an audio production of American Gods and will definitely read more Gaiman.<br /><br />I don't need to summarize the story line, which is thoroughly described by other reviewers. Just let me mention my pleasure with the tightness of the plot, the way threads opened early in the book were later picked up and exquisitely woven into the fabric of the tale. I wasn't acquainted with all of the mythology that feeds Gaiman's character development, but I recognized enough to be thoroughly impressed with his research and/or knowledge base. I enjoyed the intermingling of old gods with legendary folk heroes and the new icons of worship: technology, sex, and status. I was totally satisfied with the twists and turns of the plot and the ultimate wrap up. It made sense to me--bittersweet justice. If only one could truly reach into another person's mind and wipe out guilt. Maybe with a little imagination it IS possible.
B0023P7ZF8|4.0|....two 180-gram vinyl discs, a nice fold-out poster of the band and a cool laser etching of the H & H logo with additional design on side 4 of the LPset (the music takes up only three sides).  I found the sound quality to be better than the CD.

B001FB4W02|5.0|Except for a major stutter in mid-season, Season 8 of SMALLVILLE has been the best in several years.  The major problem with the show had long been the continuing gap between it and the traditional Superman mythology.  It was OK for this to happen for a while it was dealing with Clark's high school days, but after awhile they simply needed to get on with the story.  We've always known how it was going to end.  Or at least where a number of things would inevitably end up.  Lana would go away and Lois would take her place.  Clark would learn to fly.  He would become a superhero and embrace his destiny.  But for several years, while the show remained enjoyable, it felt more like the show was running in place than telling a story.  Season 8 went a long way to correcting this.  For instance, things really started heating up between Clark and Lois, and they turned out to far more chemistry than we had been given reason in previous seasons to hope.  In fact, I enjoyed few things in Season 8 as much as the scenes between the two of them.  And increasingly the show was brought in line with DC mythology.  In fact, the current producers have promised that the 9th season will move even closer to Superman.  And all I can say is, it's about time.<br /><br />As if to prove all this, the one real glitch in Season 8 came with the return of Lana in midseason.  The series had been moving along marvelously, with one delightful twist after another, all to come to a crashing halt when Lana came back to SMALLVILLE.  Mind you, I like Kristin Kreuk and think she is one of the cutest women in the world, but the whole Clark and Lana story got old a very long time ago and it was time to move on, not time to prolong it a bit longer.  Lana's goodbye in Season 7 should have been for good.  Worst of all, when Lana came back, Lois went away.  One of the most regrettable tings about Season 8 is that Erica Durance, despite being an opening credits character, was in fact only a halftime cast member.  I didn't count precisely, but my guess is that she was actually only in about half of the season's episodes.  For the show to move forward in Season 9, that needs to change.  They need to pull out their pocketbooks and pay Erica Durance for twenty-two episodes.  Hopefully they have realized this on their own.<br /><br />Season 8 saw a number of other DC additions.  We got additional tastes of the JLA in embryo.  We got Clark fully embracing a dual identity, as Clark on the one hand the Red-Blue Streak on the other, even wearing something of a uniform in the combo of his red or blue T-shirt and blue or red windbreaker.  He works at the Daily Planet as a reporter, sitting right beside Lois.  And he confronts during the course of the season one of the greatest Superman nemeses, Doomsday, who bears the distinction of having killed Superman in the comics.  Sharing the body of Davis Bloome, Doomsday remains somewhat under control, but when he becomes pure beast in the finale, he is pretty fearsome indeed.  For so long the show seems afraid to embrace the fact that this whole thing was about the Boy Who Becomes Superman.  Now that it is finally coming to terms with that, it has gotten better.<br /><br />I'm more excited about SMALLVILLE moving into Season 9 than I have in a long, long time.  With things between Lois and Clark becoming what it was supposed to be, with the show moving closer to the DC mythology (with one staggering exception, the death - or at least the apparent death - of a Superman universe staple), and with the new producers seemingly unafraid to move the story to new places, the show at this late date seems to be revitalized and full of purpose once again.

B001GS4U9M|5.0|[[ASIN:B001GS4U9M THE RAINMAKER By JOHN GRISHAM 1995 FIRST EDITION]]    I was thrilled to find this book.  Had watched the movie on TV, unfortunately it was so long and full of commercials, I fell asleep, so I needed to see how the story ended.  Excellent book, in great condition and arrived in a timely manner.
141690977X|1.0|If I could give this book negative stars I would. If Jennifer Anniston and the rest of Hollywood weren't out promoting this dreck, then women would be able to see how useless it is. The author does not offer anything more than a few anecdotes and \\"brotherly advice\\" in advice column format, which is so simplistic and basic that it is almost insulting, and it is a sign that the rest of the book is lacking substance and depth. His tone is condescending and patronizing; women are made to feel stupid because they don't \\"see\\" the red flags. Berendht does not take into account other factors that may be contributing to bad relationships. This book does nothing to empower women..once again all the power is shifted back into the hands of men all because we are trying to seek out reasons why our love interests may not be reciprocating our affections. If you are looking for a more insightful and intelligent read then buy Dr. Ian Kerner's \\"Be Honest You're just not that into him either\\" (not a sister novel to this crap). The relationship expert and clinical psychologist offers much more insight into why some women may seek out men who don't meet their standards, and he does it in a manner that does not insult our intelligence or make us feel worse for dating the wrong person.

We got Clark fully embracing a dual identity, as Clark on the one hand the Red-Blue Streak on the other, even wearing something of a uniform in the combo of his red or blue T-shirt and blue or red windbreaker.  He works at the Daily Planet as a reporter, sitting right beside Lois.  And he confronts during the course of the season one of the greatest Superman nemeses, Doomsday, who bears the distinction of having killed Superman in the comics.  Sharing the body of Davis Bloome, Doomsday remains somewhat under control, but when he becomes pure beast in the finale, he is pretty fearsome indeed.  For so long the show seems afraid to embrace the fact that this whole thing was about the Boy Who Becomes Superman.  Now that it is finally coming to terms with that, it has gotten better.    I'm more excited about SMALLVILLE moving into Season 9 than I have in a long, long time.  With things between Lois and Clark becoming what it was supposed to be, with the show moving closer to the DC mythology (with one staggering exception, the death - or at least the apparent death - of a Superman universe staple), and with the new producers seemingly unafraid to move the story to new places, the show at this late date seems to be revitalized and full of purpose once again.  Even though Season Eight did not end on the kind of huge cliffhanger it has in the previous seven ones, but a sad, somber one, most things will inevitably go back to normal, or SMALLVILLE's version of normal, early in Season 9.
B001FBSMF8|5.0|SCREAM BY CHRIS CORNELL IS EXCELLENT. I'M NOT HEARING WHAT OTHER FOLKS ARE HEARING.  SOME SAYING THAT THIS CD IS GARBAGE.  IT'S THE BEST THAT CHRIS CORNELL HAS EVER DONE.  GO CHRIS.

B001RTP48G|5.0|Astounding new sounds from PSB.  Usually I need to listen to a new cd at least two or three times before I can make a determination whether it is to my liking.  Upon my first listen of YES I knew that it would be a cd I would listen to over and over again.  It immediately became my favorite cd of the year.
0316017922|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell sees the world differently. Thank goodness.     Outliers is one of the most important books I've ever read. It's literally changed how I view the world. Decades ago, I had a wise high school teacher who had his class read Future Shock. I've never forgotten that book, and I'll never forget Outliers.    Gladwell dispels the myth of the self-made man. Success is a combination of many factors, and the stories we hear and read about famous men and women often leave out the most important factors. Yes, hard work is important, but so is opportunity and cultural legacies.    He cites research studies and other authors in an easy to comprehend style. I couldn't stop talking about the book when I was reading it, and I found my friends were also fascinated by the ideas.    I can't recommend this book high enough.
B001AVEJ1Y|4.0|Ever since the crew of the original NCC-1701 Enterprise signed off at the end of \\"Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country\\", the film franchise had taken a nosedive.  Besides \\"First Contact\\", all the subsequent films only served to facilitate the demise of the franchise, with \\"Nemesis\\" seemingly the final shovel-full of dirt into the coffin.  With the \\"Original Series\\" cast gone, the franchise (at least in terms of box office and TV ratings, not fanboys like me who will watch it regardless of popularity!) slowly died away.<br /><br />However, after young director J.J. Abrams began building a name for himself with such projects as \\"Alias\\", \\"LOST\\", and \\"Cloverfield\\", he decided to tackle the challenge of making Star Trek relevant again to today's audiences.  By and large Abrams accomplished that goal with flying colors, although not without a few hiccups along the way:<br /><br />The Good:<br />-Since the \\"Original Series\\" characters are still (some 40+ years removed from their show) the heart of the Star Trek franchise (people don't flock to conventions to see Scott Bakula!), Abrams resurrects them in this film by showing them in their early years of space exploration.  This proves to be the biggest success of the film, as nods to TOS abound throughout the movie.  Since those are the characters we care the most about, we hang on the edge of our seats to see a young Captain Kirk get a little feisty, a young Spock raise that eyebrow, or a young Leonard \\"Bones\\" McCoy utter his trademark grumbly phrases.<br />-Along with the time-period (pre-TOS) choice, the casting is also spot-on.  On can easily imagine Chris Pine growing into the Kirk popularized by William Shatner, while Zachary Quinto also portrays a very believable Spock.  Perhaps the most fun character in the film to watch, though, is<br />Karl Urban as the cantankerous (even at a young age!) Bones.  The actors playing the characters of Uhura, Scotty, Chekhov, and Sulu also turn in performances that easily harken back to their TOS predecessors.  An appearance from old hand Leonard Nimoy (which turns out to be a lot more than just a cameo!) also fits right in to the flow of the film, not seeming forced or desperate.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />-The main plot of the film, which involves time-travel.  While I won't spoil the entire plot in this review, suffice it to say that trying to figure out all the nuances of the plot is like trying to pin down Season Five of LOST...you can try all you want, but since time-travel is (at best) a theoretical concept, you will not succeed.  Too many times during the viewing of this film did I find myself wondering \\"huh?\\".<br />-Though promised a villain, in Nero, to be the equal of Captain Kirk, instead we get a character with much less development than Shinzon from \\"Nemesis\\".  The best of the Star Trek movies (besides part IV) have all featured villains (Khan, Klingons, Borg, etc.) that are just as interesting as the protagonists.  Though Eric Bana plays the role of Nero as best he can, there just isn't enough (any?!) character development to make him a viable and interesting villain.<br /><br />All in all, although this Star Trek reboot did a few things wrong, it still did many more things right.  I compare it to \\"Batman Begins\\", where all the nods to previous Batman films were \\"gotten out of the system\\" and thus the franchise could move forward to create the remarkable \\"Dark Knight\\".  I can see the EXACT same thing happening to this Star Trek reboot.  Though some Trekkies may be a bit peeved at the ending, it still (one way or another) paves the road for (hopefully!) many more Star Trek adventures to come!.

B0007DFJ0G|4.0|I love the three leads: Bonham Carter is amazingly good as the neurotic girlfriend, Edward Norton is a convincing tormented nerd, and Brad Pitt is an amazingly good lounge lizard-type on a mission to transform the world.  There are some excellent touches throughout, and Meat Loaf's role could make you choke with laughter -- somebody give that man a size 66GG bra. It gets a bit hard to believe, but wraps up convincingly enough.  This is NOT a family movie unless the family is all over 13, in my opinion, but it's great off-color, violent and satirical entertainment for adults.

B001U9BRNE|5.0|Here are some of the great pop songs ever written, performed by some of the great artists of our time.  A few by the originators.    If you like great music of all types, except RAP, and heavy metal rock, you will love this concert.    The Blu Ray is recorded great, and I found the uncompressed audio track. Why it's hidden is unknown to me.    I certainly have heard of David Foster, but I had no idea he was at least half responsible for so many great songs.    At 16.99, the biggest bargain I have ever seen.    I won't write a huge long review, that's been covered.  Buy this and enjoy!    Not a bad song or performance in the entire show.

B0019LY5IM|5.0|It may not have been all that long ago that Lost had its share of ups and downs, but as the fourth season before it began to prove, the show is back on top.  Be warned now that some slight spoilers are ahead here.  The fifth, and penultimate, season of Lost begins with Jack (Matthew Fox), Kate (Evangeline Lilly), Sayid (Naveen Andrews), Hurley (Jorge Garcia), and Sun (Yunjin Kim) slowly realizing that they must return to the island with Ben (Michael Emerson) at the behest of the mysterious Eloise Hawking (Brotherhood's Fionnula Flanagan).  In the meantime back on the island, Sawyer (Josh Holloway), Juliet (Elizabeth Mitchell), Faraday (Jeremy Davies), Miles (Ken Leung), and Charlotte (Rebecca Mader) find themselves, and the island itself, stuck traveling through time, which leads to some very interesting developments during the three years that Jack and co. are gone from the island.  We also witness just how Locke (Terry O'Quinn) wound up in that coffin in the first place, and how it ties into the return of the Oceanic Six to the island, as well as learn the fate of Jin (Daniel Dae Kim), and see what Desmond (Henry Ian Cusick) has been up to.  Most notable however is that we finally learn more about the island's checkered past, from the huge foot of the missing statue to getting an understanding of the never-aging Richard Alpert's (Nestor Carbonell) actions to finally getting a glimpse of Jacob in the epic and shattering two part season finale that promises everything will change.  With everything that happens this season and how Lost now deals with time travel and the consequences it creates, you'd think things may end up convoluted and confusing, but surprisingly so, Lost manages to maintain a straightforward narrative that if you've been following the show for any amount of time at all, won't get thrown off or confused in the very least, which in itself is quite an accomplishment.  Yes, the end of Lost is upon us, and like past seasons before, many questions were answered, but in one huge flash of white light, even more were raised.  The end is indeed near, and while I certainly don't want to wait until 2010 to see how everything gets wrapped up, I have a feeling that the best is yet to come.answered, but in one huge flash of white light, even more were raised.

B001IAOEXU|5.0|I'm glad I got this.  It makes FPS so much easier.  Also GTA and Fallout 3 is a lot better when your fingers doesn't slip off the L2 and R2 buttons.  Appears to be good quality plastic, and I've dropped my controllers with it on before nad it doesn't fly off or anything.  Quite secure.
B00133MKVK|5.0|She has sung for many decades and her voice remains magnificent. I like the new versions of some old songs she has previously recorded. She is a most entertaining performer. Even as a septenerian she continues to thrill the soul. I would highly recommend this album to anyone who enjoys music. I hope she decides to do another album omitting her previous songs so I can  throughly enjoy listening to her meliforous voice.
0380778556|5.0|Rebecca is one of my favourite novels because of it's re-readability. A reader is invited into the head of it's mousy heroine and asked to tread the halls of manderley, a place where the new mrs De Winter feels out of place and lost. She sees signs of her predecessor everywhere and she feels inferior to the more accomplished and beautiful woman that came before her.<br /><br />She is made even more unwelcome by the forbidding housekeeper Mrs Danvers, who doted on the original Rebecca and brings more trouble to the unnamed new wife.<br /><br />Brilliantly written, a wonderful tale of passion and jealousy. I highly recommend it.
B00003CX9W|5.0|We had Fantasia on video for our children during the early nineties. Somehow we lost it but now our son (21 years old by now) gave us Fantasia on DVD. It is still as beautiful and amazing as it was to us in 1992 (or when produced by Disney in 1942...?) Hard to get but every dollar worth it!
B001AVEJ1Y|3.0|Okay I have re-read my review and decided that it needs a bit more so I have edited.    The good:    All of the actors did the original characters proud and it was a great effort by all of them. Especially from the following:    Spock, the actor was spot on playing him and he was good as a conflicted half human/half vulcan.  Bones: Again the actor had managed to capture the essence of DeForest Kelly and he crackled in the scenes he was in.  Scotty: Unfortunately not seen enough but well handled by Simon Pegg    The space battle sequences were excellent and very enjoyable as were the sequences on top of the drill. The humour was just pitched right and astute trek fans were able to recognise certain bits from the shows or prior films (aka, the insect from Khan)    The Bad:    The plot felt as though it had been cobbled together from Rik Berman's bum fluff, it was the worst mis mash of time travel deus ex machina I have ever seen and it was done purely to re-set the star trek universe so that future movies aren't hampered by lots of already written history.     The scenes were loosely strung together and several were not very well paced or written and there were a number of moments where I found myself fidgeting in my seat.    The all powerful 'drill O'doom' as the Romulan vessel shall now be called. WTF was that all about. Granted, I could understand the planet killing capabilities, that was fine as it was perfectly capable of doing what it did do, however the ship is a mining vessel, why should it be equipped to wipe the floor with the cream of Star Fleets finest. Granted it was from a hundred or so years in the future, but still it is only a mining ship.     The removal of Kirk from the Enterprise so he could 'conveniently' run in Older Spock on that ice planet.     Uhura and Spock... unfortunately it didn't work for me because there was no basis for it. There wasn't any scenes showing Spock and Uhura together prior to them joining the enterprise so where did all ofthat come from?    Why did we have to have that sequence with the car right at the start of the film, it served no purpose save to eat up minutes of my life.    Too many 'Damn it ... I'm a doctor not a ...(insert word here). Once or twice would have been fine but that many in the movie seemed over the top.      All in all it was a fun film, but not an excellent one. As a Star Trek film it was fair to middling and by using a cack handed time travel plot to demolish the established history it revealed a cynical attempt by the film makers to re-write the Star Trek universe without giving homage to what had gone before. You can criticise the original star trek for being cheesy because from our view, several decades in the future it is cheesy yet without the original, this film would not have been made, nor would any of the sci-fi of the past 40 years. It needs more respect than this crap plot and utter destruction visited on its backstory.
B00007LTIA|5.0|The either flies over your head, or smacks you hard with it's brilliance.  When this first came out, I presented it to my college music theory teacher who considered rock music \\"trash\\".  After he sat motionless for all four sides, he not only found hope for modern music, but demanded a second pass to share his observations about the sheer genius in every passage.    I never stopped listening to this one.  Other Yes albums never seemed to fully measure up.    It appears the only ones who don't appreciate this gem are music critics and Rick Wakeman.  Legend has it, the music was almost completely written when he arrived, therefore he hated it.  Even still, his contributions were excellent.  Even a disgruntled Rick Wakeman managed to make this even more perfect.
1430300612|1.0|I just listened to the author on the radio. When asked about her \\"spiritual experience through her stroke\\" and the possible comparison with any mystical experience associated with religion, she dismissed the religions themselves as stories not being the experience itself. My objections to that answer:   1)True, they are stories but provide a time tested incremental path to reach that experience if you have not been \\"fortunate\\" enough to have a stroke.   2)how is her \\"story\\" of left brain/right brain, better than the religions' stories when it comes to getting to the experience itself? She never describes any method for replicating that experience.  3) She has no clues on how to make people reach the same state as she did,but she says she has an inspirational story...however she cannot lead anybody else where she has been. If she had gone there by her own effort and not by some accident, then she would be entitled to discard other paths, although people who achieve real realization never celebrate their path by negating others'.  4)she confuses, in a very dualistic way, a state without thought and a state with thoughts. She talks about being able to go back to that state of pure silent joy whenever she wants but that state of joy does not seem to include the present moment when she IS thinking...in true meditation one is able to be aware of both silence and thoughts without distraction. Even confusion is mindful and joyful.  5)Another very bizarre confusion is that she equates Beingness with right brain????  I suspect that she has the arrogance of the people who have just put one foot on the path and think they know it. In a completely realized being there will be integrated awareness during both the awake and the sleep state; if she is at that state, then bravo, if not well maybe she has more to learn about the integration of her \\"brain\\". Who is more qualified to lead her there than the time tested old fashion religions that have already laid down the path and wherereal teachers prevent one from becoming full of oneself?
6300988600|5.0|This episode is one of the coolest in the entire series, especially the Third Season. You have fights between Spock and McCoy, a dangerous enemy, Captain Kirk missing, and of course the Tholian Web surrounding the Enterprise. One of the series finest moments was when the Tholians started making the web. That was so cool.
B001N26GFM|4.0|This was quite a remarkable, and somewhat shocking film. Based on the novel by John Boyne, the story follows 8 year old Bruno, the son of an SS officer in 1942 Nazi Germany. The film starts out innocent enough. As Bruno and his friends make their way through the streets of Berlin playing, one could almost mistake this for any other given European city in peacetime. Everything seems alright with the world, and even Bruno's father the SS man is a loving family man. Everything changes when father gets promoted, and the family has to move to a new house in the country. What Bruno doesn't realize is that his father has just taken over as Commandant of a concentration camp. In fact, Bruno doesn't even know what such a camp is, or what its purpose would be. Thus he is perplexed when out exploring one day, he comes to the camp fence and meets a boy his own age on the other side. They develop a friendship, and the story culminates in a somewhat startling denouement. The film also gives some interesting insight into family life in Nazi Germany; it's always odd to see a Death's Head insignia sporting killer behaving as any other dad would. I must say, there did seem to be something slightly far-fetched about the story, Bruno's complete naivete, etc, not to mention the English accents. But minus that, I found this to be a very sad yet compelling story that successfully portrays this horrific period through a child's eyes. Definitely worth checking out.
B0007Y08PQ|1.0|This is by far the worst Star Trek movie ever made.  TNG made plenty of bad movies and this one is no exception.  First off, this does not even feel like a movie.  Instead, it feels like a two-part TNG episode.  So instead of watching this disgrace, watch any two-part TNG episode because it will be better.  Many minor characters were given lame lines just to give them screen time.
B000PTYPAC|5.0|This CD is a must for any Paramore fan.  Every song on it is great!
B0000UJL96|4.0|As I mentioned earlier, the \\"Golden Years\\" of Star Trek were from 1979-1986.  The Undiscovered Country is by far the best Trek movie released after 1986.  However, the movie does have some faults.  Many flaws are exposed when you watch the movie a second.  By this I mean that some things simply do not hold up under closer scrutiny.  All in all, TUC was a decent way to end the original TOS films.
0756405890|1.0|Other reviewers have said it more politely, this being a first book and all, but all the sugarcoating to be \\"nice\\" isn't helping anybody. The plain truth is this book is mediocre at its best and more often quite bad.    Lengthy stretches of the book were downright tedious and uninteresting. Patrick Rothfuss, the book's author, did a particularly poor job with pacing and maintaining believability. There were many times I tossed the book across the room, threw my hands up in the air and stomped off to do something more fun like watch the paint in my bathroom dry. I'm not kidding I did that once as this book was what I brought along to read when we moved to our new apartment and were repainting.    Frequently sections of the book were plodding and slow. Many of these sections seemed to be meant to flesh out Kvothe's backstory but they were mindnumbing and tedious. They could have been cut, and undoubtedly would have been cut by a good editor, without impacting the story. The result would have been brisker 400-page read that might not have been so awful.    Many other lengthy stretches of the book were downright terrible. Reading these required effort, and this coming from someone who normally loves to read long books. When I hit these sections, I wondered if it was worth the effort. These sections made the book seem to be two or three times as long as it was.    So how to rate a book like this? The zero star rating is not an option. 3 stars would reward mediocrity. 2 stars would be generous. Why 1 star? Well, beside being one of the worst books I've ever read in my life, this book put me off reading for a month. I simply lost interest in reading after this.
B000A6T1KE|1.0|The Star Trek franchise temporarily died after this movie was released.  This happened for a good reason and I wish it had stayed that way.  Nememis emulated TWOK too much and relied on a week Romulan villain with a really big ship.  I am so glad Star Trek 2009 was nothing like this film (sarcasm).    Data's death was stupid and at that point I really didn't care.  If there had been a sequel, he would have came back in B-4.  Thus, the Wrath of Khan like Nemesis would have been followed by a movie similar to The Search for Spock.  Lame!
B00258SS72|5.0|Fitting end to a great American actor's big screen career.  This movie takes you on a rollercoaster ride of deeply personal emotions and will make you CRY to see how it ends!!!  ANY movie that can do that, most certainly deserves FIVE STARS!!!
B00078XGRO|2.0|What is wrong with today's audience?  Mindless action flicks like First Contact and Star Trek (2009) are eaten up like nothing else.  Save your money and watch the first four Star Trek movies.
B001PPLIFU|2.0|The Movie:  After loving the heck out of Casino Royale, it was pretty much assured that I was going to see the inevitable and sequel but I was not prepared for what I saw. This was not the Bond I wanted to see after CR.     It all starts off with one of the worst car chase action scenes I've ever seen. Thanks to the shooting style, it's incoherent and annoying to watch. The movie tries so hard to be a new Bourne-style spy romp mixed with some very bad elements of older Bond movies; such as globetrotting around the world on the most convenient pretexts. CR put Bond in his own, more realistic but not real, world. This movie tries too hard to place him in the real world and be Bourne and it fails miserably. It's pretty long and mostly boring. The action also tries too hard to be Bourne, extensively utilizing poorly-done shaky cam. My girlfriend and I did not enjoy this and one of my friends began slamming his head on his knees after about 30 mins.    Blu-ray:  Picture and audio are excellent. Barely much to mention in the bonus features department. It's very safe to expect a double dip when the next bond movie hits theaters.
B000002MP2|5.0|Well, it's been a long time since I've written a review, but I figure I'll come back on something big and amazing, like Green Day's \\"Dookie\\". Not much is needed to be said about this album, because a lot has already been said.  Even though this is one of Green Day's earlier albums, it shows that they've got skills in the songwriting department, as shown in such classics as \\"Chump\\", \\"Longview\\" and \\"Welcome To Paradise\\". As young as they were when they wrote these songs, they make them interesting and exciting. Then we have more riff-rocking anthems like the classic \\"Basket Case\\" and the melodic, shout-a-long \\"She\\". We even get to hear a bit of country influence in \\"Pulling Teeth\\"! Then comes along the mid-tempo \\"When I Come Around\\" a nice break in the faster pace of other songs.  Overall, if you like this style of music, you really can't go wrong here. This is one of those albums that you can play all the way through and love every second of it. It's the sound of thundering guitars and basses, and energetic drums. It's the sound of a summer day outside in California. It's the sound of classic Green Day! Thanks for the time, and peace.

B001R4MEYS|5.0|Mastodon is a band that is nothing short of amazing. With their last two albums, \\"Leviathan\\" and \\"Blood Mountain\\" we've gotten masterpieces that combine both heavy instruementation with intelligent lyrics. Now comes along \\"Crack The Skye\\", their most recent work of brilliance.  Although this album doesn't have the bruality of the last two albums, it delivers the good just as well. \\"Crack The Skye\\" shows Mastodon delving more into their progressive sound, experimenting with guitar tones, multiple riffs, complex time changes, a more hypnotic sound, and overall approaching each song with a bit of a softer sound.  Don't worry though, because Mastodon still shows us that, no matter how progressive and experimental they become, they're still a metal band at heart. Throughout the album there are several sections of intensity that the band does so well. But overall, the feel of this album is less about the intensity and more about taking the soundscape to a grand, epic scale.  The whole album flows with space-like, otherworldly vibes that make it sound so huge and galactic. In addition, the band shows its songwriting skill and great amount of musical talent. I highly recommend this album to all fans of Mastodon, and even the newcomers, although I recommend you check out their earlier songs first. What this album lacks in hardcore riffs and shouting vocals it more than makes up for in its spacey vibes, astral epic sound and progressive technically, all while sounding amazing. Thanks for the time, and peace.
B000F8O4DQ|5.0|I waited a long time for this. I've been a fan of this album forever, and unlike some of my other 'faves', this one still gets plenty of rotation. It did however, need remastering as the original issue CD is a tad sterile sounding with regards to fidelity. Nonetheless...     This album is nothingly less than one of the Top10 all-time greatest pop/rock albums. There isn't a dull moment on the entire thing, and even the extras on this reissued version shine. The bonus track Surrender could have easily been a top40 hit. And considering that this album contains the band's best music from a compositional standpoint, it makes sense that they included instrumental rough mixes of classics like So Fine, Tightrope and Telephone Line, which nearly act as stand alone pieces. And there's an alternate vocal take of Telephone Line, which may give you pause deciding which version you like better.    Many people have purchased ELO's Greatest Hits and called it good, but a few of the tunes on New World Record never made it to the first Greatest Hits album and IMO, these songs are essential - tunes like So Fine, Do Ya, and Tightrope represent some of ELO's finest work. The title track is a minor pop-prog masterpiece and Shangri-la is a great way to end an album, with its blatant homage to The Beatles' Hey Jude.     Maybe some of the newer comps have remedied a few of these songs' lack of inclusion elsewhere but now that this album has been remastered (quite well actually) its a no-brainer...I can't recommend this album highly enough.
B001N26GFM|3.0|Which is why I am reviewing this. The promos I had seen for this movie had not prepared me for this. Be forewarned.<br /><br />The movie is good. Just remember, the young boy in this book lives near a concentration camp. His father is the SS officer in charge of it. I suppose with this setting I should not have expected a good ending. Nevertheless, I was blindsided by this ending. This movie ended very disturbing and I was unable to sleep after viewing it.

B00067BBSC|5.0|My friends laugh at me, but I seriously feel a profound sense of regret over never having seen Toto live. And this was the tour I really should not have missed -- no question this is the best line-up the band had since Jeff Porcaro's death in 1992. Don't be put off by the fact that several great songs are played as part of medleys: it works fine, it allows them to work in some interesting instrumental segments, and the transitions in several cases are terrific. Almost all your favorites will be here, and they also play several older tracks that did not appear on \\"Past to Present,\\" including \\"Girl Goodbye,\\" \\"Gift With a Golden Gun,\\" \\"Waiting for Your Love,\\" and \\"Afraid of Love,\\" that are great tunes. Not everything is perfect, of course: David Paich practically talks his way through the verses in \\"Africa,\\" and Steve Lukather's voice has roughened considerably. It's great to have Bobby Kimball here though. His voice is a little less sure than it was in 1982 -- occasionally he sounds a little off-pitch, and there's some noticeable strain -- but the voice actually has more character. He's more of a blue-eyed soul singer than just a light-voiced late 70's singer. Steve Lukather's guitar playing is another highlight -- he looks as if he has complete command. Having listened to this several times now, though, I have to say the most impressive contribution may be Mike Porcaro's on bass. \\"I Won't Hold You Back\\" I think is probably the best track on the disc, really nicely updated with a much different rhythmic feel, and it's largely because of Mike's bass line, which has this sweet melodic contour at the same that it punctuates the vocal line and serves as the underpinning for the harmony. I just took a look at a clip from the more recent DVD, \\"Falling in Between Live,\\" and my first thought was \\"Who is that on bass?\\" No Mike, and that's a bummer. So this is the one to get. DVD production values are only so-so, I could care less about the extras, and the tunes taken from their album of covers released just before the tour aren't that interesting after the first listen. But it doesn't matter. This is the best version of the band we'll ever see in a concert video, and having missed them, I couldn't be happier to have this. Toto forever!
B00007LTIB|5.0|I have always liked Yes, from my teen years.  I had to buy this, to hear what they really recorded.
B001GCUNYO|5.0|SYNOPSIS  Former government operative Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) had given up his career as a so-called \\"preventer\\" to be close to his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). Even though Bryan joins his former colleagues for side jobs to make ends meet, he spends most of his time to be a part of his daughter's life again. Soon, Bryan gets hit hard when Kim requests permission to go to Paris with her friend Amanda (Katie Cassidy). Knowing what dangers lie ahead in a foreign country, he says no at first, but Kim's disappointment leads him to a reluctant yes. Soon after they land, Bryan's fears are soon realized when Kim and her friend get abducted by unknown assailants from their apartment - in broad daylight. Before getting dragged away, she phones Bryan and starts leaving him clues. This begins the longest 96-hours of his life - a hunt that will take him to the deepest, darkest corners of Paris and face unbelievable nightmares worse than he experienced in black ops. And Bryan will make sure that no one will stop him from saving his daughter.      MOVIE  What can I say? This is one hell of a roller coaster ride from beginning to end! This is Liam Neeson at his best! Taken delivers on the action, drama and suspense it promises. There is never a dull moment! My favorite part of the movie was when his daughter gets abducted, the assailant picks up her phone and Liam tells him:    \\"I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills; skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you.\\"    This will easily be one of the most memorable movie quotes for many years to come. Phenomenal movie!      PICTURE QUALITY  Other than some grainy shots in a few scenes, the PQ is perfect. Nice, sharp gritty picture.      AUDIO QUALITY  Whoa mama! Fox sure knows what to give its customers - a reference quality audio experience that can deliver. This can easily be used for a demo display to showcase the power of high definition surround sound. Remarkable and flawless!      OVERALL  If you are a Liam Neeson fan, this is a must own! If you love action, drama and suspense, you must own this! One of the best action movies of 2009!
B000053VAF|5.0|A way of looking at mythology and how we are controlled by it. The intellect is subordinate to the dogmatic powers of religion. It scares me , but yet it makes me think.
B00005JN8Z|5.0|The Biblical epic is a fascinating genre in cinematic history, fusing secular and sacred factors of diverse history and religious mythology into a panorama of lush spectacle and hard-hitting emotional impact, always delivering a poignant message about the purest ideals of the human condition triumphing over evil. Considering that World War II had come to a close and a new conflict - the Cold War - with new enemies - the communist USSR - began soon enough, it would be reasonable that American audiences in the 1950's desired to escape into the legends of ancient empires and Biblical times, therefore reclaiming not only a sense of wonder, but a higher degree of faith within themselves.<br /><br />Although the genre had been established in cinema during the silent era, and was resurrected by Cecil B. Demille with his film SAMSON & DELILAH in 1949, it was with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's 1951 adaptation of Henryk Sienkiewicz's novel QUO VADIS (produced by Sam Zimbalist) that the enormously successful trend of Hollywood-produced Biblical epics during the 1950's really took off. And even though it's not as faithful to the novel compared to the more recent 2001 Polish version (save for the bare-bones narrative and a number of duplicated scenarios involving Nero and the Imperial Court), and therefore not as historically accurate (Sienkiewicz made a meticulous effort of researching the Roman Empire at the time of the emperor Nero, while fusing it with the religious undertones of the New Testament within his narrative), it has, along with later films of a similar nature like THE TEN COMMANDMENTS and BEN-HUR (also produced by Zimbalist), stood the test of time as one of the most colossal (as billed in the trailers), earnest and emotionally-powerful productions ever forged. Truth be told, it even holds its own when put up against similar, but less-earnest, modern-day epics like GLADIATOR, TROY and KINGDOM OF HEAVEN, films that rely on their visual styles to carry a somewhat emotionally hollow plot line. (The only epic in recent times to really pull off QUO VADIS' style perfectly is the LORD OF THE RINGS Trilogy, although the more recent ALEXANDER and 300 DID make admirable attempts to enhance the level of the human condition within such spiritual/mythological/theological territory).<br /><br />As with the book, the film is set in Rome during the year 64 A.D., about 30 years after the Crucifixion of Christ. Enter Marcus Vinicius (Robert Taylor in a performance that he has failed to top since), commander of the 14th legion, who returns after three years service against the native tribes in Briton for a full period of relaxation in his estate in Sicily. Upon his return, he is introduced to the Lygian hostage Lygia Callina (talented British rose Deborah Kerr, pre-FROM HERE TO ETERNITY and THE KING & I), whom he desires with an erotic intensity - while being completely unaware of her position as the member of the ever-growing Christian sect within Rome. Through the machinations of his uncle Caius Petronius, Nero's arbiter-of-elegance (Leo Genn giving a dignified Oscar-nominated performance), Marcus intends to have Nero legally assign Lygia to him as his property, but through the aid of her sect she escapes. In tracking her down, Marcus eventually discovers the nature of her sect, and upon finally meeting her, in a fit of humility confesses his true love for her, as she does for him. However, he faces the hard decision of whether he should abandon her in order to uphold Nero's rule and the Roman way of life, or forsake his Roman background and join the sect so that he can remain with her. That decision is made for him when Nero (the scenery-chewing Peter Ustinov, who tied with Leo Genn for a nomination in the Best Supporting Actor category, one he would eventually win in SPARTACUS), chooses to fulfill his dream as the \\"true artist\\" by having his Praetorian guard burn Rome so he can rebuild it as part of his \\"epic\\", then chooses to pin the blame on theChristians in order to escape being fatally punished by the Roman mob.<br /><br />QUO VADIS, while it may not be perfect, works on so many different levels that it's Herculean to find something that tops its style (in my book, it surpasses both GONE WITH THE WIND and TITANIC). While those looking for a romance will definitely be smitten by the chemistry between Taylor as Marcus and Kerr as Lygia, the real acting magic lies in the scenes between Genn as the humanly-cynical Petronius and Ustinov as the self-pitying (not to mention matricidal) Nero, particularly those scenes where Petronius is forced to tolerate Nero's ineptitude as a poet in terms of writing and vocal performance. They are aided immeasurably by a strong supporting cast of characters, including Finlay Currie (as Apostle Peter), Ralph Truman (as the corrupt Praetorian commander Tigellinus), Buddy Baer (as Lygia's body-built guardian Arsus), and Patricia Raffan (as the conniving harlot empress Poppoea).<br /><br />Mervyn LeRoy's direction makes excellent use of bright, saturated Technicolor cinematography within the Academy aspect ratio of 1.33:1 that, when combined with the superb sets, costumes and special effects (the latter factor co-created by Tom Howard of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY fame), result in some of the most overwhelming visuals ever generated on screen, especially during those scenes depicting the burning of Rome and the martyrdom of the Christians thrown to the lions and burned on crosses within the Colosseum. It's a truly breathtaking experience of heightened scale, and proves to be even more authentic given that was all accomplished long before CGI took hold of creating such sequences.<br /><br />Also notable is the vibrant score by Miklos Rozsa, at the time a former composer of music for film noir and standard dramas (including his Oscar-winning music for SPELLBOUND and A DOUBLE LIFE), which captures in full essence the love between Marcus and Lygia, the march of the legions, the thrilling action scenes and the relentless spiritual faith of the Christians. Rozsa's score was a first - it created the distinctive theme that many people usually associate with epic motion pictures, and one which he would put to further use in other Biblical epics during the decade, climaxing with a third Oscar win for his music in BEN-HUR. Those epics not scored by Rozsa (which curiously did NOT include THE TEN COMMANDMENTS or SPARTACUS), imitated his sound to perfection, and later composers such as John Williams, Jerry Goldsmith, Basil Poledouris, Hans Zimmer, and Howard Shore have all paid respective homage to Rozsa ever since, in particular Williams within the STAR WARS & INDIANA JONES films, and Shore in the LORD OF THE RINGS Trilogy.<br /><br />Don't miss it, especially if it's released on the big screen. Whether you like it or hate it in the end, QUO VADIS is still a must-see that will remain memorable long after most commercial successes today have faded from memory.order to escape being fatally punished by the Roman mob.

B000FS9MV0|3.0|Renee sings beautifully & sounds older and more confident than her years.But, I find some of these songs don't suit her. I really only enjoyed the ballads.  Hope the next album (which I will buy regardless) has better songs on it. I really enjoy listening to a great singer interpreting the standards with the intelligence and sensitivity that Renee has. Perhaps too many cooks spoiled this broth. Keep it simple next time.

From the first chords, you feel as if she is climbing upward - the upward struggle we understand to have been so much of Beethoven's life and art.  I have 4 other recordings of this piece and none approach Beethoven with such an understanding of music, and the man.  Superb!
B001SF8G1Q|5.0|This and Blood On The Tracks are my favorite two Dylan albums. For my money, New Morning has the best musicianship of any Dylan album, and also a unique spirit that combines both optimism and sadness -- it has brought both me and my wife to happy tears. It is a truly wonderful album.<br /><br />I recall that when it first came out, as a total Dylan fan I was disappointed at first hearing, and at second hearing. It probably took four or five hearings before it finally reached me. And then it became my favorite, and was for many years, though over time my respect for Blood On The Tracks has grown.<br /><br />So be sure to give this album a chance even if you don't immediately see why many people would love it! Its beauty is of a different kind than any of Dylan's other work -- it's a quiet, reflective joy.

B000NA2776|5.0|I am not much of a pop fan. Okay, I'll admit that I have some on my computer and it is really catchy, but in general pop isn't my first choice of what to listen to. Nevertheless...<br />A couple weeks ago, someone linked me to the music video of Lollipop. I was addicted instantly. After checking out some of Mika's other music videos, I knew I just had to get this CD. That investment paid off - I'm not entirely sure just what it is that makes almost every track on this album so irresistable, but Mika's got it down to an art.<br />Most of the tracks are bouncy, catchy fare, although they're far from being meaningless fluff. For instance, \\"Grace Kelly\\" apparently talks about Mika's frustration with the music industry's attempts at creating his image for him, \\"Lollipop\\" is a message from Mika to his little sister about love, and \\"Big Girl (You Are Beautiful)\\" reminds women that big can be beautiful - Mika again draws on personal experience here, as his mother was a larger woman and he saw the way people treated her based on her weight.<br />My main problem with the album is that Mika, like so many other artists, can't resist throwing some slow songs into an otherwise energetic, fast-paced album. Thankfully, his slow songs aren't bad, but I'm still not a fan of artists insisting on throwing slow songs into an album when they're really not needed.
B0026OR1UK|4.0|We've all wondered what the \\"ingredients\\" are to become truly great at something, We've all ruminated on what seperates the average from the good from the great. As a teacher, I have spent many hours reflecting on the constitution of good teaching and good learning, both key things to understand in order to connect with students.     Daniel Coyle's book, The Talent Code, points to three of the most important ingredients to greatness: deep practice, ignition (motivated passion), and good coaching. He also unveils for the general reading public a new, and quite maverick, theory of how the brain maximizes learning and memory: rather than the brain's synapses (connections between neurons) being the key to rapid recall and retention of information, Coyle suggests that the answer lies in myelin (a lipid based chemical that coats the synapse connections). myelin, Coyle suggests, makes neural connections stronger, and the stronger they get, the better and quicker our brains work.     How myelin goes takes us back to the age-old maxim: use it or lose it. myeiin, like the synapse connections they protect, grow stronger based on repeated use. In the language of psychology, this amounts to the idea that the more one practices, the better one gets. But as Coyle notes, not just any old practice makes perfect. DEEP practice is the type of practice that finds the practicer struggling to work through a problem, correcting and monitoring herself as she goes until she gets better and better. So, it is not how much we practice, but how thoughtfully and reflectively we practice.     The next section of The Talent Code is devoted to the idea of ignition, or, motivation. It almost goes without saying that to be great, one needs to be motivated to be great. In fact, one key ingredient of deep practice (that Coyle should have mentioned in this second section) is that deep practice can only take place in people who are so motivated that they can fail, try, fail better, try better, etc. Thatis what 'ignition' is about; it is not only about practice, but the desire to keep practicing and improving.     Lastly, Coyle talks about what makes a master coach. A master coach, it turns out, is not one who is the most knowledgeable, the most inspiratioanl, or the toughest. Being a good coach is about the ability to foster and guide deep practice (and ignition) in pupils. If one cannot see the \\"big picture\\" of what a master should be and constantly guide students towards that vision, one can simply not be a good coach.     Through each of these sections, journalist Coyle uses highly illuminating and engaging examples of his points. What is deep practice? Ask the players on the small island of Curacao, or the players at Brazillian soccer academies. What does optimal ignition look like? For that, we travel to the KIPP charter schools (where the key motivator is college, college, college). A master coach? We examine the likes of famed basketball coach John Wooden and reknowned cello instructor Hans Jensen. Not only is the book very insightful, but it is quite enjoyable.     There is one major complaint I do have about this book - the author's quite myopic mentioning of myelin. Like someone who has stumbled upon the next great x, Coyle is quite over-the-top in his enthusiasm for myelin being the new great answer to the question of how we learn. Even many of the scientists he quotes temper their enthusiasm for myelin saying that myelin's link to learning is only tentative and hypothetical at this point. You'd never know it from Coyle's very non-tentative statements.     Further, I found the chapter and numerous sections devoted to the myelin theory of learning are wholly irrelevant to the book's point. Whether myelin helps coat neural connections to make them faster and stronger is quite unnecessary to understanding that deep practice + ingition help us learn. While it is an interesting idea to think about, we do not need to see ignition as (Coyle's words) \\"nyecinizing\\" the brain: it works just as well to simply see it as igniting the passion required for success. Thus, about 35 pages of this book could have been left out without doing any damage to the author's points.     Anyhow, all that aside, I STRONGLY reccomend this book to people, and particularly to educators concerned with how to better teach their students. Since reading this book, I have tried to incorporate some of the book's ideas about deep practice and effective coaching. While it is too early to see if these ideas have worked in the classroom, I can say that this book can't help but inspire all in the teaching profession (and those puzzling over how to learn better).
076781326X|4.0|I bought this for my kids (9 and 4) and it was really too dark for them. A good version, though.
0307408833|3.0|I had pre-ordered this book because 3 of my family members have Celiac Disease.     First reaction was the general disappointment that a cookbook labeled \\"Gluten Free\\" was not gluten free. Then I was worried that someone would make something for my husband thinking spelt flour was ok for him to eat and he would become very ill. It is very dangerous to throw around words like \\"gluten free\\" when someone's health is on the line.    Second reaction? \\"Holy Crap! This is going to cost me a fortune!!!\\" Every single recipe calls for coconut oil, and after making just 3 recipes from the book I have used an entire $10 jar. Agave is the primary sweetener which is also extremely pricey. I have been using maple syrup instead, but I've used almost an entire $18 jug in those same 3 recipes. Add to that the flours, ricemilk and various other gourmet/specialty ingredients and you've spent a small fortune.    The recipes are pretty yummy, though, I must say. If you've got the money to spend and aren't totally offended by her misuse of \\"Gluten free\\" then I suggest trying a couple recipes out. Though they aren't without their problems as well... If you are used to cooking gluten free you know that it isn't ever without it's hiccups, and adding \\"Vegan\\" makes it all the more challenging. I would say this cookbook is not for the beginner cook at all.    Here are the recipes I made and my reviews:    Lemon Poppyseed Teacake  Very yummy, but a little dense. Not fooling any non-celiacs with this one. It was still moist even 2 days later which is hard to find with GF things.    Chocolate Chocolate Chip Cookies  The batter was super runny and greasy. I had to add an additional 1/2 cup of rice flour just to keep them from running all over the pan. They were very tasty, but my husband thought maybe they could be sweeter. They seemed somehow bland. I think adding chopped dried cherries or mint flavoring or something else would have helped. These also stayed moist.    Chocolate Chip Banana BreadThis one is my favorite. The recipe calls for 6 bananas (SIX!?!?) and I only used 2. I put it in the pan and I thought there is no way this is going to bake all the way through, so I split it into 2 pans, and thank goodness. I think it would have overflowed.    So the down sides:  #1. not entirely gluten free  #2. really expensive  #3. recipes may take some tweaking    And the good things:  #1. the book is beautiful  #2. pictures for almost every recipe  #3. recipes stay moist and are very tasty
015206396X|4.0|This book a great read!!The slow pace in the beginning is the only reason I would give it four stars. However I was elated and very satisfied when I finished reading the book.     In Katsa's universe, along with the normal people live people who possess a 'Grace'. A Grace is an ability or talent that the regular people lack. Katsa's grace is killing. A child with a killing Grace? Katsa was not welcomed in society once this ability was discovered. People maintained a distance from her. But the cunning ruler of her world however decided to hone her ability for his own questionable purposes and so a highly trained Katsa begins to heed the beck and call of her King.     In the midst of this, Katsa realizes her king is not always justified and forms a council with her friends who secretly help the suffering and the distressed. On one of these missions she meets Prince Po, a Graceling prince while rescuing none other than his grandfather!     Soon Po finds himself in her castle and they begin to form a heartwarming friendship. Burdened with the secret of his own grace, Po finds that he can truly understand Katsa. With his help, Katsa begins to fight her own inner demons and tries to come to terms with her inner being. She is afraid of turning into a monster. Soon she defies her King and leaves his court, showing everyone what she is truly made of and what she stands for.     Po and Katsa leave the castle and begin searching for the truth behind his grandfather's kidnapping. The rest of the story is what happens on this journey. Does Katsa come to terms with her emotional issues? Can she find peace within? Does she open her heart to Po like he opens up to her? Can she face her fears and find the mettle to overcome them? Does she find her true place in her world? And can she bring justice to Po's grandfather and help the innocent people who are suffering?     This book is a captivating read with an excellent plot and the right twists and turns. It really picks up pace in the latter half and is hard to put down. Katsa is a very well developed character and a strong inspiring protagonist. Her relationship with Po is perfectly balanced and is just what the doctor ordered for her. The author's ability to convey the manner in which Katsa deals with her emotional issues is truly noteworthy. It is believable and realistic and you will feel every emotion Katsa feels. The only one thing I wish it would have had is some kind of a physical weakness for Katsa. Making her a super human killing and survival machine was stretching it a bit too far. I mean every super hero has some weakness. Katsa had no Achille's heal whatsoever and is pretty much indestructible, physically I mean. Overall, it's a book I cherish and will definitely recommend to others.
0385333846|4.0|Adding my drop in the bucket of reviews:    I enjoyed the book. It is insane at times, a little hard to follow, and leaves certain questions unanswered. But to me, these were all a part of the fun. It has an anti-war sentiment to it that doesn't leave the bitter taste of being preached at in your mouth. It mixes the grimmest of realities with outright science fiction in a way that makes it nearly believable.     The book follows the life of Billy Pilgrim, a tall, odd, mentally unstable un-hero, as he jumps from one part of his life to the next. He spends time in a mental hospital, on his honeymoon, on another planet, drowning in a pool, but mostly, he spends it in Germany in WWII. As a chaplain's assistant, he is taken prisoner by the Germans and witnesses the bombing of Dresden.     Billy is not brave. He is not strong. He is not particularly compassionate or kind. In some parts of the book, I outright hated him for his apathy. In others, I pitied him for his insanity. Overall, his story is just a narrative with no real emotion involved... But, I suppose, that was the intention.    The story made me think. Made me consider everything from old wars to new ones, to time travel*, to family relations... And that is the most important thing to me in a book. I docked it one star because (though there's a reason for it) all of the violence and death made me uncomfortable. So it goes.    *I might add that I like nearly every story involving time travel of some sort or another, and this makes me a little bit biased. It's the nerd in me coming out.
B0015KO52S|5.0|A fantastic record by The Raconteurs.  Well written, well recorded, well worth the purchase.  Even if you aren't a Raconteurs fan, this is a good rock record to keep you in the loop on new music.
B00005QFE5|5.0|Initially (I'd only recently discovered Zhang Ziyi) I was doubtful: the cover illustration gave me the impression that it's a children's story, for children.  On the other hand, though, were others' reviews, so I couldn't quite put it out of mind.  Finally, after passing it over a half-dozen times or so, I decided -- still doubting and hesitant -- to buy it on the strength of Zhang Ziyi's acting in other films.  I'll not attempt to detail the \\"plot,\\" or incidents in it -- others have done that with varying degrees of accuracy.<br /><br />It is not a children's story.  (But will do no harm to children.)<br /><br />At the end of my first viewing I was speechless. Though a published writer, I could find no words to describe, or represent, or capture what it is, what it does.  I've since lost count of how many times I've watched it -- spellbound.  I've struggled to find the words with which to write adequate review; but as that has seemed impossible, only added comments to other reviews.  This is the best I've been able to do:<br /><br />Elementally human.<br /><br />Humane.<br /><br />Universal.<br /><br />Exquisitely gentle.<br /><br />Eventually I put it back into its case and onto the shelf.  But the very next day I had to put it back into the DVD player.  How can so moving a story be made of a few ordinary, inconsequential materialities? --<br /><br />An old chipped and stained -- but favorite -- bowl, both imbued with and vessel for an innocent, open, generous heart.<br /><br />A red jacket.<br /><br />A barrette.<br /><br />Mushroom dumplings.<br /><br />One road to and from a tiny village, which seems most often to run in only one direction: from.<br /><br />Made moving by means of some incomprehensible magic.<br /><br />The film itself, to the eye -- every frame a painting.  I don't know that I've ever seen another so perfectly realized, both perfectly balanced contrasts of crisp black-and-white, and splendid countless soft colors of autumn.<br /><br />The expert use of lines -- hills, trees, mountains . . .<br /><br />It is an extremely rare film which one forgets has a camera present. Even when I consciously reminded myself there was -- that understanding almost immediately evaporated.<br /><br />Flawless acting, especially by the shapeless girl/young woman in pigtails and baggy trousers.<br /><br />A gift from those who made it, beyond the reach of all deserved, humbled, reverent superlatives.  Special as a barrette, as mushroom dumplings.<br /><br />You need to own your own -- widescreen -- copy.  And a multi-disk DVD player as vessel for it -- so you needn't remove it when you want to watch some other film.
B00007KQA3|3.0|Fairly good movie (1984 made in \\"1984\\"), better then the 1956 version of 1984 but still not worth the $40 + price tag!
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|Heyy!!! It's me again!!! 9 hours ago I rated Circus (CD). So check that out too!!! Here is my review for Blackout:    Gimme More- This is the lead single on the CD and probably one of the best. She was supposed to comeback at the 2007 VMA's with this song, but she ended up running crying off stage. 10/10    Piece Of Me- This is my and my father's favorite on the CD. That's right even my father likes this one. It's electrified, although you can't help liking it. I pplay this track over nad over... 11/10    Radar- Like I said in my Circus review, I LUV THIS SONG!!! It's about her spying on a dude. JAMMIN!!! And her new single!!! 2,000,000/10    Break The Ice- This one has a very catchy beat. This is the one my mom likes. Especially in the breakdown. Very technological. 10/10    Heaven On Earth- I'm the only on who likes this one. It's kinda like \\"Break The Ice\\" it gets stuck in your head, and that's what a good song does. 10/10    Get Naked (I Got A Plan)- I give this song very little confidence. It has too much adultness in it for her making her comeback. The most innapropriate song on Earth. 8/10    Freakshow- This is the only song on the CD that I don't like. It's got this beginning intro that sounds like she is farting. And then she raps the whole time. Glad it's only like 2 minutes. 2/10    Toy Soldier- I like the beginning when the dude is talking. This is very danceable and fun. One of her only electrified ones that I Like. 10/10    Hot As Ice- I remember when this came out as \\"Cold As Fire\\". LOL. This one is not danceable, just listenable. Yet, awesome. 10/10    Ooh Ooh Baby- This is my favorite one on the CD. It sounds like Spanish guitar in the beginning!!!                   1,000,000,000,000,000,000/10    Perfect Lover- This song is kinda innapropriate. Although this one is able to dance to. I like it. 9/10    Why Should I Be Sad- It's a ballad/hip hop song that's electrified, about how good she did on the album. It's kinda ego. In all her songs she sings about how everyone loves her when they don't. 7/10    SKIP  Freakshow  Get Naked  Why Should I Be Sad
B001UJUGZY|5.0|According to some info gathered on the net, the rights to the movie were bought by a production company and they are pulling the DVD release to try and release the film in theaters... I am not happy.
B001K3JF7K|5.0|This album is beautiful and great for relaxation or romance.  The lush background orchestration is a perfect compliment to Krall's smoky soothing voice.  Also, each song is slow and keeps the overall mood, unlike some compilations which change pace and jangle the listener.
B001U6YI92|4.0|Don't miss Christopher Frayling's terrific commentary which is packed with production information and incisive observations.  Particularly touching is the way Frayling takes up for Leone's decision to humanize Tuco, pointing out that this movie, far from a straight shoot-em-up, shows Leone coming of age.  (This part of the commentary is during the great scene where Tuco meets his brother.)  Frayling makes a few errors that are a bit surprising... Eastwood says \\"sure\\" rather than \\"pshaw\\" in a key exchange that Frayling gets wrong, and Frayling claims that Lee Van Cleef does not have part of his finger missing, a point definitively refuted by scenes in FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE... but his love for this movie comes through resoundingly.  This is one of the best commentaries I've heard.  And the transfer, despite whatever DNR was applied, looks very detailed, film-like, and beautiful.  Take it from somebody who has seen the movie over a hundred times... this Blu-ray is worth getting!    EDIT: I recently got the Mondo Blu-ray of this title and what everybody has been saying is true; it is utterly superior to the MGM transfer in picture quality.  It's a shame that this Italian version (transferred from a print owned by the Leone family) doesn't have an English soundtrack, but since I know this movie by heart anyway, I'm fine with it.  Let's hope that someday this beautiful transfer is issued in English.

075640407X|5.0|Wow...I just finished this book...rushed to the computer, anticipating ordering the next one in the series...and lo and be hold...it isn't out yet.  Talk about heartbreaking.  I can't wait to read the next one.  This is one of the best written novels I have ever read.  It is very polished.  The main character is extremely well thought out.  Time isn't wasted on non-essential fluff...but you aren't overburdened by it either.  I am very impressed with this writer!  He writes like a seasoned author of multiple series...    anyway...I want DAY 2!  Does anybody know when it will be out?
B0000AUHOH|4.0|While this film is nothing like the others, I find it refreshing in that regard. We need a film in the collection where McCoy, Spock, Kirk are sitting around a campfire. After all, Spock pretty much just died, and is trying to get back to his usual self. But beyond that I thought the plot was indeed sketchy to say the least, but still kind of interesting because it was so different. The conversations between the three main guys, are just priceless though.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|This device is great.  It is much more comfortable than my previously used Nostromo n52.  The software is great and the color changing feature is nice.  The thumb stick works well, but feels like it may only be 8 direction instead of full analog.  The LCD looks nice, but to be honest I hardly ever look down.
0694003611|5.0|I too was once a sceptic as to why everyone liked this book. My niece used to love it and I hated reading it to her. Now that I have my own child (3 months old), it is one of the simplest books to read to him before bed. As soon as I utter those first words, he gets a huge smile on his face. We read it every night and have since he was about 6 weeks old. I just love the basic story and rhyme, and I think the basic colors on the pages are appealing to little ones. I got 5 copies at my shower. Highly recommend.
B00260HH3K|1.0|Simply, a horrible movie for a number of reasons; my review will be more of a summary of SOME of the MAIN points mentioned in the other reviews (that I noticed) instead of a stand-alone review. The movie's acting and story is horrible, it does not follow the origins it's taken from faithfully (and not in a creative way; I don't protest to improvements or \\"evolutions\\"), and all in all a boring and horrible movie. This movie is just an example of Hollywood taking something amazing, stripping it of its glamour, and throwing it back at the audience purely for the sake of creating more $$$.    Simply put, DO NOT BUY! If you MUST see the movie and are desperate to waste two hours of your life, rent or borrow!
B00009RAJH|5.0|Speedy service. Quality product. Happy customer.  Had to get this Fleetwood Mac CD, not only because  it's classic but also for the song \\"Sugar Daddy\\",  which I can listen to over and over again. Stevie  Nicks is sexy.

B0000AM6K2|5.0|My girlfriend and I were taking a drink at a bar in Mazarron, Spain and this   record was playing. We both thought what great tunes but the waitress had no  idea who it was and returning home I remembered the lyric \\"could have taken   the Brooklyn train\\" and we found Josh Rouse. And what a find! Great songs   and great production by Brad Jones. From 1972 to Rise you are made to feel   part of it either identifying with the lyric or riding along on the tunes   and getting a great vibe. A truly satisfying record and I wish I'd found it   when it came out in 2000.
B00292V3PS|4.0|The end of this season? oR Series? I am unfortunate. I can't get the CW.  I live on the big island of Hawaii...I LOVE my home but the cable companies suck big time here,  Anyway  to the review:  Great show acting, plot...but just like other earlier seasons, at the ending there was little clue as to what is going on... Which makes you wonder if they got cut/sacked/cancelled  Or what? I can not think of a series that ended at season 8. the general rule is 5, 7, 10...esspecially with a show this popular.  I wish UNBOX would give it's customer base a link to each show's \\"site\\" so no matter what show you buy, no matter what season it is... the consumer (me) can find out what's what with the show.  Did it occur to any of you at Amazon that many of us unboxers buy what we buy because we are unable to get it on our cable network... in other words, we know it's there but you are our only acess. please provide links to each shows home page.
B000K1P66W|5.0|This is an awesome book. Must be read with an open mind. When you practice these four agreements you can experience heaven right here on earth. It helps you to think about who you are and where your beliefs came from. It gives you a lot to think about.
0756405890|5.0|The good news: according to Pat's blog posts above, he finished the second book a couple days ago. So at least we know it will be forthcoming. The bad news is that as I write this, I only have about 50 pages to go in The Name of the Wind. Then what? Simply a great book, destined to be mentioned as one of THE greats in the fantasy genre. I'm wondering how a trilogy will be able to include everything about Kvothe's life to this point. Hopefully he will then start out anew, as he's \\"younger than he seems\\". Thanks Patrick, for such a great book, and wishing you have all the well deserved fame and success that is your due.
B001TOD92C|5.0|I hesitate to mention that I am a long time wrestling fan simply because of the image that statement can conjure up in peoples minds. Yes, I have all of my teeth, no I do not sport a mullet. Wrestling fans are often derided for their choice of entertainment, and at times when watching some of the god-awful programming WWE has been putting on the air over the years, I sometimes ask myself why do I tune in to watch two men fake fighting? I truly cannot answer that question.<br /><br />When I first heard about \\"The Wrestler\\" coming out I figured it was going to be a throw-away comedy. Something starring David Spade or Artie Lange that would probably go straight to DVD. As I began hearing more and more about the film, I was intrigued. The film was going to be a straight drama, not an excuse to poke fun at wrestlers or their fans?<br /><br />The film is simply fantastic. \\"The Wrestler\\" doesn't really delve into the \\"why\\" of wrestling, but the \\"who\\". This is a character driven film about two broken people who are searching for \\"something\\". Mickey Rourke as Randy \\"The Ram\\" does a phenomenal job, and it's easy to see why he was nominated for Best Actor at the last Academy Awards. His lonely character grabs you in a similar way to Stallone's initial portrayal of Rocky Balboa does. You like Randy, and want to see him succeed. You cringe at the choices he has made, and the choices he continues to make, yet you always root for him to come out on top.<br /><br />Even if you hate wrestling, you will love this movie. Having you chuckling one moment, and with a lump in your throat the next, \\"The Wrestler\\" is a film you won't forget for quite awhile.
0743216458|5.0|If you have any interest in the price that was paid for our freedom in the United States and the world, this is the book to buy.  I actually saw 2 of the HBO specials before I bought the book.  But I have finished the book before I have finished watching the specials.  I think what has impressed me the most is that these guys, through this experience, felt somewhat resposible for the safety of each other.  Some of them would have a wound that would keep them off the line for a while, but they would come back to be with the men they have come to be so close to.  Brotherhood!  I admire that in these men.

1601251556|4.0|I'd rate t a 4.5 if I could.  This thing is huge, has a front and back (one side gray (stone), the other brown (dirt)).  Making maps has never been so easy.  I used to use a dry erase board and had to make the 1\\" squares, now I just have to make the map.  Thankfully, because of the 2 sides I can have 2 maps prepared before a game.<br /><br />The reason for the 1 less star is that it's not as \\"hard\\" as I thought it would be.  It does fold up which is nice for packing, but when you unfold it, it doesn't stay completely flat easily.  Luckily, you just have to put a couple books on the edges and it stays flat enough so the figures don't fall.<br />I use it for D&D and now I can't go back to my old dry erase board (oh, it's easy to clean off too).  I'm certain that I'll end up buying one or two more boards from this seller (they have caves, boats, and keep maps already made).
0142501123|5.0|This book was a gift for my 2 year old son.  He sits rapt while I read the story and enjoys identifying the animals and noticing what has fallen off the witch's broom.

I'm going to buy all Julia Donaldson's other books!
0060853972|5.0|In 1988 two great British humorists got together to write a story about the end of the world.  I'm overselling a little here, but think of it as if the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin got on stage to jam together in the early '60s or so before they were huge stars.  As you'd guess, the result is something unique--and hilarious.<br /><br />How can the end of the world be funny?  Watch and learn.<br /><br />Long ago in the Garden of Eden, a demon named Crawly tempted Eve & Adam to eat the apples off the Tree of Knowledge and thus get kicked out of the garden.  Taking pity on them, an angel named Aziraphale gave Adam his flaming sword to use for protection and making fire.  Since then Aziraphale and Crawly (now known as Crowley) have formed a friendship even as their masters (ie Heaven and Hell) plot to destroy each other.<br /><br />Along comes the big moment when Crowley is supposed to deliver the Antichrist to a satanic group of nuns, who will then switch the evil baby for the normal one born to an American cultural attache--a reference to \\"The Omen.\\"  Except one of the nuns messes it up and the Antichrist ends up going to a normal British family in a place called Lower Tadfield while the supposedly evil baby is watched closely by the minions of Heaven and Hell.<br /><br />Skip forward eleven years to when the time has finally come.  The Four Horsemen are getting to ride out--for fans of Pratchett's Discworld series the Horseman of Death is the same as in those books with the speaking IN ALL CAPS and the same dry wit--only now they've upgraded to Harleys.  The lost continent of Atlantis has risen to the surface once more.  And other weird stuff is happening, but now someone needs to find the Antichrist.<br /><br />Crowley and Aziraphale, who have grown fond of if not humanity itself then at least all of humanity's stuff like books and Bentleys, set out to avert the seemingly inevitable End of Days.  Their efforts are joined by a witch whose distant relative Agnes Nutter wrote a book of prophecies that never sold because of their terrible accuracy, a pair of witchhunters, and a gang of kids.  But can they avert the Apocalypse in time?  (Well, we're still here, aren't we?)<br /><br />It occurs to me now that director Kevin Smith really should have read this book (and taken notes) before making his lamentable \\"Dogma\\" that dealt with similar concepts but was bogged down with too much information and not enough laughs.  Gaiman/Pratchett (or Pratchett/Gaiman) manage to seamlessly blend in Biblical elements without sacrificing the humor.  But as I've come to expect at least where Mr. Pratchett is concerned, there's intelligence behind the humor.  Some of it may be a little too British (like Mr. Shadwell's terribly thick accent) or a little dated (like the jokes about answering machines, computers, and cassette tapes) but even so it's hard not to go more than a page without laughing.<br /><br />This is a superb book that I think would make even those most fundamental Christian crack a smile.  And as I said at the beginning, you're probably never going to see two masters get together like this again, so don't miss this opportunity.<br /><br />That is all.<br /><br />(BTW, as I finished Pratchett's Discworld series I thought this would make a perfect segue into my next book, Gaiman's \\"American Gods.\\")tter wrote a book of prophecies that never sold because of their terrible accuracy, a pair of witchhunters, and a gang of kids.

B000VDDWE2|4.0|I'm not looking to review the movie since you can get tons of reviews everywhere.  All I'll say is that it's a fun movie if you don't take it too seriously.<br /><br />The video quality of the Blu-Ray edition is really good, good enough that you don't notice it, you just feel like you're in the action.  It's as good as being at the theater.  The sound quality is also good, but not perfect; in places it's muddy, particularly when there's a lot of weather howling sounds.  Dialogue is crisp and easy to follow, but this doesn't drive your subwoofer as much as you'd expect given the subject matter, and some of the sound just doesn't pop like you'd figure.  It's not bad, it's just not as good as you'd hope.

B00018D44U|4.0|Every song on this album is well-crafted, well-performed, well-chosen, and enjoyable.  Yet somehow the album doesn't add up to the sum of its parts.  It lacks anything that stands out, or anything that connects its parts together.  It's certainly no \\"Come Away With Me,\\" but if you liked that, you will find this worth having.
B001TH16DI|1.0|When Will You Learn? Think back to the VHS and DVD releases of these movies and learn.  Paramount is playing the same games.  Wait for at least two more releases on Blu-Ray before you buy.  Wait for the fully-restored, Special extended editions and you will be truly happy. Rent them or watch your upconverted Special extended editions until then.

It is exactly what I wanted. It has the classic \\"Sub\\" design, the ultra-reliable Miyota automatic movement, and unlike other reviewers, I find the build quality to be solid. I have about 25 watches in my collection, and this one easily gets the most wrist time. It has become my favorite, and I would highly recommend it to anyone with a large wrist who wants a big, heavy, bold watch that makes a fantastic statement without being to gaudy or \\"blingy\\".

B000I2JDEY|5.0|Elizabeth Taylor won her second Academy Award as Best Actress in 1966 for her portrayal of acid-tongue, foul-mouthed Martha in \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf\\". The film is one of the best movies Hollywood has ever made, and it stars an ensemble of actors rarely seen together in film. Liz's husband at the time, Richard Burton, co-stars as George, the man Martha belittles and disrespects, and Sandy Duncan and George Segal are cast in the supporting roles as Honey and Nick, who are invited to George and Martha's late one night. The film was raw for its time as it featured language never before heard on film. The movie is based on the Broadway play starring Uta Hagen, and many thought Liz could never pull off such a demanding role. For Martha Liz gained 30 lbs, wore a grey wig, and virtually became this character. Liz's portrayl is one of the best female performances on the big screen and it solidified her as an actress with a caliber that many do not possess. Even Joan Crawford became a fan of Liz's after viewing the film.<br /> The movie still holds the record as being the only film that received Oscar nominations for every award that it was eligible for. It won five Oscars, including one for Sandy Dennis.<br /> Mike Nichols directed the film, and he is known by modern audiences as the director of \\"The Birdcage\\" starring Robin Williams, and as being Diane Sawyer's husband.<br /> The DVD is full of bonus features, including commentary by Nichols, documentaries on the film, screen tests, and more.<br /> Come in and have a few drinks with George and Martha: your life will never be the same!

0060595183|5.0|Our understanding of psychedelics is a reaction. We call it a drug and classify it as illegal. As humanity we slowly develop and take a very long time to be free from our old conditions while creating new ones.     Aldous Huxley is sharing, from his own experience, a way to understand these chemicals and the potential they hold as magnifying glass to the conditioned reality of self center and the truth of total union and realization.     I recommend this book to any one who feels courageous enough to take a step aside from the old taboo and travel.

B0014XCMVM|4.0|Far from running out of steam, Alanis continues to evolve as a songwriter.  This album isn't a reinvention, it's not unlike what she's done before, it's not something new or someone new.  But it's also not a retread.  It's a new version of the things that made Alanis great, a new step in her development.  Nothing on this album feels like filler.    Admittedly, nothing on this album feels like the immediately infectious hooks of some of the previous albums.  This is not a few singles on an album with other songs, it's an album that happens to be made up of songs.  And they will grow on you.
0743298039|5.0|This book was a book club selection so I expected a slow read, but I could barely put it down.  The sense of mystery, the flash back, the parallels between two sets of lives...My first outing with this author, but not the last.
B0016HNOXQ|4.0|After so many years passed, I was expecting when I heard there was a third album that it might be weak.  The uninspired name didn't evoke any confidence either.    And while this album isn't quite the match of the previous two, and has a few songs on it that are a bit odd, the album holds together surprisingly well.  Individually, some of the songs are good and a few are really good, and collectively, the album holds up better than you'd think, the songs build on each other.  This is not an album to be played as individual tracks in a mixed playlist for its best experience, it's an album to play straight through.
B00127RAJY|1.0|I have to say starting out that I do not watch The Biggest Loser as I am not a big tv watcher and find most shows a waste of my time.  If I had I probably would not have gotten this video since her voice just *grates* on my nerves and I really don't like it when she says to \\"look at her girls\\" as they are exercising.  Even my nine year old told me never to do that work out again since \\"the instructor scared\\" her.  It is an ok workout, although if you do only one section, extremely short.  I prefer Jari Love, The Firm, Tracy Effinger, and exercising longer than 20 minutes at a time.  This one just wasn't for me.
B000MRA5NS|5.0|I'm not looking to review the movie; plenty of good reviews can be found.  I'll just say it's a solid action movie that takes the best of Bond and sheds the worst excesses and eccentricities of the franchise, and is thus the best Bond movie in a long time, if not ever.<br /><br />The Blu-ray edition is a flawless transfer.  There's nothing at all to complain about regarding video or audio quality.  I haven't watched the various bonus features so I can't comment on them.  But what's important is that you get the movie theater experience, as well as your home theater can give it, at least.  And that's what this disc does.
B0002EXH4A|5.0|I've listen to everything they have and in my opinion this is the most well rounded non-mainstream album ever put together. If you were ever to own a Megadeth Album this is the one to have. If you only like mainstream garbage please refrain from buying this is for only real metal fans!!!
B001FB4W0W|5.0|From the man who brought us Six Feet Under and the network that gives us the best television around, comes another great series.  This is a terrific show, that gets better and better as it progresses.  The story, writing and acting are all top notch.    It is way better than Twilight.    Alan Ball and HBO have done it again.    Watch it, it is a very good show.   Its Twilight for adults and thinkers!
0143038419|5.0|Great price, book condition is new as advertized, very fast delivery, and I will do future business with Amazon.com again because of the efficiency of the transaction.  Thanks for the sale.
B001PJRAUS|4.0|This was a great movie. I liked it much more than the Jane Austen Book Club because it seemed more genuine to me. It's a fun, earthy look at Jane Austen characters and shows how much people haven't changed, despite vast differences in technology and social conventions.
0312360266|2.0|It was a disappointing  book. I was expecting so much more then I got from it. It was pretty boring to me and I got very tired of all the academic talk after she had gotten to school. I really didn't care what page they were on in Vamp.101. Really just give the vampire action! The very last chapter of the book was the only one that I felt had any excitement to it at all. Through out the book there were hints here and there that there  is a bigger issue going on and I am holding out hope for it to be more exciting then this first one has been. But I am also not in any way making a run for the second book if that gives you a clue. For me these would be read when I have absolutely nothing else to read. I don't think I would be recommending these to anyone to also waster their time with them.
B001N26GFM|3.0|I really had a hard time figuring out a rating for this film.  It is also tough to rate this movie without giving away the ending but I have to try.  Overall the movie was very interesting.  You never get to see the other side of the \\"Nazi's\\".  The movie portrays a Nazi military family who doesn't exactly know what their father does.  The movie is the journey of the family from big city life out to a concentration camp in the country side.     The mother is kept in the dark about the actual goings on.  The main story is about a curious boy who can't stand to be stuck in his house.  He is an adventurer who ends up finding out that there is a \\"camp\\" near his house.  Though he is only 8 and doesn't understand what is going on, it is his journey of understanding that we follow in the movie.  Overall I would say it was a 4 star movie until the ending.  The ending is tough to deal with and for me it dropped the rating quite a bit.      I would not necessarily recommend this movie to anybody.  It is a light but dark drama and if I had known what I was getting myself into I probably wouldn't have watched.  Just trying to being honest without giving everything away.
0810979772|5.0|My 8 yr old son started this book last year, and I have had so much fun listening to him read his entries - all written with the imagination and crude humor of well an eight year old and some of them hilariously spot on.  I treasure these glimpses of him, and I'm so grateful there are authors like Mr. Kinney and Dav Pilkey (among others) who are still themselves boys at heart.  When my son has finished his \\"journaling\\" and has laid the book aside, I'll put it up for safekeeping, as I'm  sure it will become one of the most treasured keepsakes from his boyhood.
B001FB55MG|4.0|I was really impressed by Adam Sandler and his latest movie Bedtime Stories.  I picked it up not really sure what to expect.  I thought it was going to be primarily fantasy but it wasn't.  It definately has its part of corny and fun fantasy but is really fun trying to predict what is going to happen.      The story follows Adam Sandler (Skeeter) as an uncle having to babysit his sister's (Courtney Cox) kids.  They are not allowed to have much modern technology around so Skeeter has to make up his own bedtime stories to put the kids to bed.  Little does he realize but parts of the stories come true as the days go on.    It is one of those movies that gives adults something to laugh about and kids at the same time.  I enjoyed it because it is definately Adam Sandler style just cleaned up for kids.  I can't recommend this enough especially for a good family movie night.
B001PA0FFO|5.0|This metaphor-filled, majestic portrayal of the Catholic Church during the Second Vatican upheaval will be difficult to forget.  Set in a Catholic School in the 1960's, the mechanics of how the horrendous scandals of the abuse by priests were allowed to occur, is explained in a new light. The male-dominated church, in which the sisters were treated with little respect and their opinions with even less validity, is portrayed realistically, yet it doesn't point a finger of accusation.<br /><br />The scenes are nothing less than beautiful in their simplicity.  Streep's portrayal of Sister Aloysius Beauvier is realistically spectacular, and John Patrick Shanley's portrayal of Father Flynn clearly depicts the attitude of the priests during this time period. DOUBT is actually a depiction of the importance of trusting yourself, even in the face of doubt.
1416550534|4.0|Most enjoyable story, like being in an epsiode of the BBC production,  Upstairs, Downstairs.
B000002GYG|5.0|I loved this album when it came out 30+ yrs ago but lost it somewhere down the trail. But the images, expressions and vibe are impossible to shake. Waits' cinematic, improvisational riffs disguise the genius of his craft. Think Beat generation poet meets jazz combo while hitching on a boxcar and they hop off to play a gig at a diner in exchange for patty-melted norms and Viceroys. Good thing somebody recorded it but your clothes will smell smoky just from listening. This is one that must be listened to in the dark. Brace yourself for Big Joe and Phantom 309, your heart ends up in your throat. But no Heimlich required.
B001PPLIEG|1.0|I think M (Judi Dench) is right when she calls Bond (as played by Daniel Craig) a \\"cold bastard\\". His eyes are as hard as his body with no trace of a sense of humor. Previous Bonds always had a gleam in their eyes. I'd rather watch Goldfinger for the umpteenth time and wait for Sean Connery to say \\"Poo-say?! I must be dreaming.\\" than to watch this again.
B001TOVZYQ|4.0|I was never a big Donnie Yen fan until now. Donnie Yen is a great martial artist but I never liked any of his movies. Ip Man is his greatest performance. Being a Wing Chun practioner, I really was impressed with his skills, Donnie appeared to be a student of the art for many years. His acting has greatly improved also, he WAS Ip Man. He was the perfect choice to play this role. Asian producers always seem to use Jet Li to portray historical characters, I'm glad they choose Donnie. Fearless was a great film also, but Ip Man is by far superior.
1416955070|4.0|I liked this book, was recommended to me because of my interest in the Twilight series (supernatural theme).  The characters are not really expored too well, just quickly touched upon which is somewhat frustrating.  The story of a 15 yr old girl who finds herself immersed in the supernatural when her mother is kidnapped.  She meets Jace and his friends who help her, along with her childhood friend Simon.  One thing that bothered me is how does Simon not see the shadowhunters in the club or coffee shop, but them sees them later on at Luke's house and thereafter??  I like the ideas of the vampire party and their lair in the hotel, but wish they would've been described more about. However, since it is a young adult book, I do have a problem with the so called \\"Star Wars theme\\" that is revealed in one of the twists.  I felt it ruined the chemistry that Clary and Jace had. All in all, it's a good read and quick page turner. I definately am buying City of Ashes to see what happens next.
B002436WJE|4.0|I'm sorry but I had no problem with this movie it's great. I heard good things about it and more power to them cause it's better than I was told it pwans. 2 people caught my eye in particular Liam Neeson & Fammke Janseen I like her as an actrees. I'll say for a PG13 film it's hardcore. Basically Liam Neeson plays a retired government agent or CIA something in that order and just wants to spend time with his teenaged daughter Kim who has wants to become a pop star. She has a friend who wants her to go to Paris with her while in Paris Kim and her friend Amanda are kidnapped and basically she's on the phone with her dad. and he records the phone call he goes to Paris he only has 4 days to find his daughter.It's a race against time and because his daughter is in a human trafficking ring and has to find her. If you love Movies like Commando revenge flicks like Hard to Kill  I mean there have been great films but this actually lived up to the hype.
1439138311|4.0|Colm Toibin's Brooklyn is an enchanting read that drew me in quietly, quickly, yet dramatically through its understated yet beautiful writing. An Irish-American myself, I was drawn to Eilis and her experience in her new land. She was innocent, of course, and quite naive, but these qualities seemed quite appropriate in a story set in the early 1950s. Toibin's character development is multifaceted, and I came to know the people in this book and found myself invested in their outcomes, a realization that came slowly. But good friendships develop that way too, don't they?  When I finished the book just a few minutes ago, I put it down with a sigh and relished again how wonderfully written a book it is.    Brooklyn is a short book: I finished it on the front end of my weekend and count myself lucky that I had also picked up a book of Toibin's short stories at the library.
B001IZGPJG|2.0|I might be alone in my opinion, but, apart from \\"Seven Lives\\", this DVD seems like a re-edit of other scenes from their other videos, or in the case of the beautiful \\"Same Parents\\", just boring.  Why you would ruin a beautiful song like that with 4 minutes of watching fire is beyond me.  Maybe I am just not seeing the symbolism, but I had a hard time watching all of it without falling asleep.  But I could be wrong.  Still Enigma's music cannot be topped when it comes to bringing me peace when I hear it.
044661758X|3.0|Concrete Blonde is the third book by Michael Connelly featuring Detective Harry Bosch.     The book brings us back to the first Bosch case, which culminated with his shooting of a serial killer: The Dollmaker. Now, just when Bosch is on trial for wrongful death in the Dollmaker shooting, it looks like the Dollmaker is back. That's awkward timing.    As far as Bosch goes, Concrete Blonde has the best character development in the series. Bosch is no longer swimming in darkness. Connelly lets up from Bosch's macho demeanor enough to allow him to interact non-destructively with everyone around him (a first). This is a pleasant change from the previous two books, which were exceedingly grim, and had a protagonist that was hard to support.    When it comes to the mystery, however, the hunt for the Dollmaker Jr. is a seriously truncated affair. There's a small circle of obvious suspects, and Bosch merely jumps from one to the other until he finds the right one. Procedurally, this is a pretty awful process (no wonder Harry is on trial...) and doesn't make for a very interesting piece of detective fiction.    I look forward to Connelly combining the new 'lighter' Bosch (who is still more depressed than a dozen other detectives combined...) with a slightly more fleshed out mystery.
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|Although I am more familar with Next Generation, I went to see it with my Mom and she is a original Trek devotee and she LOVED it. So there's your litmus test. All the younger version of Enterprise crew members are almost all uncanny resemblances. It rocked my socks to have Lenord Nemoy as the older version of himself.<br /><br />It had all the classic feel and really none of the old TV set camp feel. No small order. If you have any affinity for Sci Fi this movie is a must see.....
B001PPLJIQ|3.0|I liked this movie because it was interesting too follow. I liked the actors and thought the story moved well. There are some touching scenes. I did feel there was too much male nudity. I was like is this a porno or what? But It was moving because of my own love affair with a older woman when I was young. Although I also realized while typing this that the woman in this movie is a pedophile. But she is a woman so she gets a pass I guess.
B0014I4KIK|5.0|I stumbled across this CD when I was browsing through BMG.  I was familiar with the hit single 'Mercy' and was curious to hear the rest of Duffy's songs.  I was completely enthralled with her the moment I started listening.  If ever there is to be a Motown revival, Duffy will lead the way.  Her catchy voice with its amazing range and her soulful songs are simply incredible.  I think this album is simply spectacular in every way!  She is so fresh to the music scene...not the normal, run-of-the-mill crap that is all too common with the young female artists with no talent whatsoever.  Duffy breaks barriers with her voice and songs.  She has tremendous talent and this is an amazing album...buy it...you won't be disappointed...
031606792X|5.0|I really loved the way Stephenie Meyer ended this series.  Breaking Dawn was my favorite, probably because everything came together and ended well, but I liked the whole series.  When I finished Breaking Dawn, any other book I started to read was a let-down in comparison!
B001PL4HZW|5.0|It's a very good soundtrack. Almost all the music from the movie is on this cd.
0765342294|4.0|From cover to cover, Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card is a page turner. If I had one criticism, I'd say the flow of the book speeds up a bit abruptly toward the end. Overall a wonderful book - I look forward to reading more from Orson Scott Card.    The binding of this paperback decided to destroy itself within a couple hours of reading, with normal use (not opening it too wide or folding it).
B0012GUI08|5.0|Classic Account of Alienation and Absurdity<br /><br />Review of \\"The Castle\\" by Franz Kafka<br /><br />This book made me into a Kafka admirer. He brings life to characters in otherwise drab situations and makes them seem very real. The reader feels the frustration, absurdity, the pettiness and the powerlessness in a personal way. You feel the haughtiness and aloofness of the Castle staff as if they were a part of your own community. You feel the pettiness and delusional gossip of the townspeople as if you were seeing it first hand. The story is riveting and the pace seems fast even when there is little action.<br /><br />The story starts with the protagonist (identified only by his initial, K.) walking to what sounds like a routine surveying job. Soon he is frustrated by a very confusing series of obstacles. As the story develops the obstacles become more chaotic. K.'s original purpose in going to the castle is never fully elaborated and his motives seem lost or stolen. The forces acting upon K. are shrouded. It seems as if some invisible force has plotted to test K. to the limit of human endurance of tolerance of ambiguity.<br /><br />Kafka combines the themes of:<br />social class commentary,<br />alienation from a heartless social system,<br />absence of any protective power,<br />salvation,<br />redemption,<br />fear of strangers,<br />fear of change,<br />search for the meaning of life,<br />inscrutability of authorities,<br />indifference of forces ruling human fate,<br />persistence in the face lost purpose,<br />abuse of power<br />and<br />acceptance of pointlessness goals.<br /><br />As the plot progresses it takes on a surreal nightmare quality. Is the protagonist having a nightmare, going insane or confronting the reality of his situation?<br /><br />There is no end to the frustration. We are never told if K. is having a nightmare or going insane. We never discover why K. is so determined to enter the castle that he would tolerate and even join in to the absurdity. His original purpose of doing a surveying job could never justify his struggle to gain admittance. We are left seeing K. as a perpetual outsider. Perhaps Kafka is telling us that there is no end or limit to frustration, alienation and absurdity. Those seeking an answer to the ageless enigma of existence will never find a simple resolution.<br /><br />This is a disturbing work that challenges conventional notions of plot and character development while testing the readers conception of his/her purpose in life. The Castle will confront the reader in unexpected ways and raise emotional personal issues that would otherwise be repressed.<br /><br />See:<br /><br />The Metamorphosis<br /><br />The Trial<br /><br />Amerika<br /><br />Collections:<br /><br />The Diaries of Franz Kafka (Schocken Classics Series)<br /><br />Collected Stories (Everyman's Library)<br /><br />The Z&uuml;rau Aphorisms of Franz Kafka<br /><br />Blue Octavo Notebooks<br /><br />Kafka's Selected Stories (Norton Critical Edition)<br /><br />Give It Up: And Other Short Stories<br /><br />Great German Short Stories (Dover Thrift Editions)<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.e absurdity.

B0000257O9|4.0|I still lived in Belgium when the Buggles hit big with the \\"Video Killed the Radio Star\\" in late 1979, and couldn't wait to snap up their debut album, back in the vinyl days. Now, 30 years later, I bought this reissue.<br /><br />\\"The Age of Plastic\\" (11 tracks, includind 3 bonus tracks; 48 min.) plays like a trip back in time, and plays surprisingly well, frankly. The album starts off with \\"The Plastic Age\\", an epic 5 min. track that expands on the sound of the \\"Video\\" tune. The original album only had 8 tracks, 4 on each side, and was a quick listen. \\"I Love You (Miss Robot)\\" sounds as fresh as I remembered it, as does \\"Clean Clean\\" (another single), and the closer \\"Johnny On The Monorail\\". In all, I am quite surprised how well this album has aged almost 30 years later.<br /><br />There are 3 bonus tracks on this reissue: the delightful lite-reggae \\"Island\\" (likely a tip of the ol' hand to their reggae-label Island Records), the quirky but non-essential \\"Technopop\\" and a different version of \\"Johnny on the Monorail\\". The reissue comes with great liner notes from the band as well. In all, just great. This just leaves one question: when will the band's equally delightful (and currently out of print) 2nd album \\"Adventures In Modern Recording\\" get the reissue treatment?
0312360266|5.0|After just finishing the 4th book in the Twilight series(which I loved), I purchased the House of Night series, with little expectation for it to meet the level of reading enjoyment I got from the Twilight series.  I'll admit that it started very slowly for me, and I almost thought that it was a lost cause... until I got about 1/4 of the way through Marked.  By that point, I was hooked.  I couldn't put the books down, and managed to fly through all 5 of them in 13 days!!      If you're a Twilight fan, you seriously need to leave your comparisons at the door, because it's a totally different style of writing.  I'm not saying that's a bad thing at all, because these books turned out to be just as enjoyable.  PC and Kristen cast did a great job, and I am so looking forward to many more of these books to add to the series(I heard that there will be 12 total, and I'm really hoping that's true!).
B000OVLBGC|5.0|This is one of the best experiences I have had in a movie theatre, ever.  It will change you, if you let it.  How?  Because it will show you how a man, a bad man, becomes a good man, a hero, without trying, just by turning toward that void inside each of us that knows, just knows, right from wrong.  You will loathe the main character in Act I.  By Act III, you will love him.  Long after you have left the theatre, you will not be able to stop thinking about him.  In the long run, you will never again be able to look at your neighbors in the same way.  I used to treat everyone the same, as just another potential means to an end.  Not now.  I can't say I'm a better person.  But only that everyone else seems to be.  Maybe this film just reminded me that in a land filled with liars and thieves and fools, it's still better to be kind.
B000F7CMRM|4.0|Normally, I prefer movies that focus more on characters with events as the background.<br />Syriana has a stronger focus on the story/plot. Very involved.

If you like movies like Babel, you'll probably enjoy this one.<br /><br />--

B000GDH9JQ|5.0|I searched for this movie on DVD for a long time.  It contains performances that should be preserved by Mikhail Baryshnikov and Gregory Hines, two of the masters of dance in this century.  And the movie itself is not half bad either.
0375842209|5.0|I looked at the book and thought, wow. .a big one. I read it super fast and couldn't put it down. It is about a girl who gets separated from her mother and brother and her new family hides a jewish man in their basement. Death tells the story and is a very interesting twist on a narrator. It is a great story and although very sad it really will make you think.
B001DTPZNY|4.0|I loved the 1st three, and was excited to find out that they were making a 4th.      I do not want to give any of it away for those that haven't seen it, but it is nice to know the producers/director reprized or mentioned past characters that are familiar.      As for the ending, it is an interesting twist.  A rather odd one, but I have heard the theory before for several different civilizations.
006085880X|5.0|Jodi Picoult is amazing. period. Pretty much every one of her books I've read I can't put down and have amazing twists in turns. .this one is no different. It's more about the 4 parents who were best friends before their children entered a suicide pact, and only one survived. The story is told through them and how it has affected their lives and friendships. I'd recommend it to someone to read.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|Gran Torino is a movie you must see. Clint Eastwood's performance as Walt is his best work as an actor in years.  In fact, this might be the last time we see him in a leading role.  Sure he was belligerent, prejudice, judgmental, and even racist, but it's part of what makes his character interesting.  He's brilliant and imposing, shocking and so over the top he's often funny.  This is the Clint Eastwood we all remember in a perfect, and possibly final, performance. He's riding off into the sunset in typical Eastwood fashion, snarling, growling, and spitt'n blood!
074325144X|3.0|I think many of the concepts featured in this book are useful in helping me improve my running posture. However, I think this is a concept created by one person that works for that person - and has fortunately worked for enough other people to become a 'craze'. Based on the number of years I have been a runner (25) and the number of injuries I have sustained (3), this system of Chi Running is not something I am going to spend a lot of effort trying to learn. The most useful things I took away were some breathing techniques and some posture techniques, but this 'flat foot' way of pounding the pavement simply does not feel natural to me.  Just like everything else in life...take a little bit of different things, think and act critically about it, and make it your own.
B0009QTS1M|5.0|\\"My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius, commander of the Armies of the North, General of the Felix Legions, loyal servant to the true emperor, Marcus Aurelius. Father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife. And I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next.\\" --Best quote from any movie I've seen to date!    ***spolier alert***    Believe it or not the first time I watched this movie I didn't like it.  It didn't turn out how I expected or had hoped.  You know, the typical Hollywood ending where Maximus would ride into Rome with his armies at his back to conquer Commodus in an epic battle of good vs. evil.  Instead Commodus cheats and kills our hero.  After watching it a second time, however, it became my favorite movie of all time and that still holds true today almost 10 years removed.  The real story is Maximus' enduring honor, pride, and devotion to family, country and his morals.  I could go into greater detail, but there are better wordsmiths who have gone to great lengths to write some awesome reviews.  I just thought I'd throw my two cents out there.    If you haven't seen the movie, buy it!  You won't regret it!

B001TODCII|5.0|This movie is a great action flick. If you like the Bourne Identity, then you'll like this. Liam Neeson plays a former government spy who goes on a rampage in Europe, tracking down his kidnapped daughter. My only complaint is that there was not more footage of the ex-wife because she is a major hottie that I loved watching play Jean Grey on XMen.
1439102813|5.0|I manage a retirement community with a memory care unit.  I love my people and constantly try to read and learn more to get a picture of what their life is like inside of the dementia and alzheimer's.  This beautifully written book examines the whole slide into the disease in heartbreaking detail.  It made me cry with anguish as I put myself in Alice's place.  The book, the words, the lesson stayed with me after I put it down.  This read will forever change how I relate to my wonderful residents for no matter what they are going through, they are the sum total of all the wonderful things they have achieved throughout their lives.  I will encourage others to read this.

The only disc worthy of being in the set is the Halloween Extended Edition because it was out of print until now. No bonus discs of additional footage or interviews are included. There are special features on each disc but again, they have all been released previously. I was hoping for a bit more. I understand that due to rights issues, they cant release a complete boxed set with every Halloween film but I would have been happier with just Halloween and perhaps Halloween 2 Extended Editions with some NEW bonus features.<br /><br />To those at Anchor Bay... give us fans what we deserve and have been waiting YEARS for. Id like to see uncut versions of the films Ive loved my entire life. I know of unseen footage that has been shot for Halloween 2, 4, 5, 6, H20, and Resurrection. Lets see it already!<br /><br />This is a nice set to own IF you dont already own the films from prior releases. Otherwise, dont bother. Its close... but no cigar!
B001PJRAUS|5.0|This is an amazing take on a classic movie and novel that has been done in many different version updated and back in the day.
B00004R99F|5.0|Ever since I was 5, I've loved this movie! I haven't watched it in years, and I saw it on tv yesterday and was a good way to refresh my memory. On the last day of school, Max Goof tries to impress Roxanne, a girl he likes. When he makes a fool of himself dressed as Powerline, a famous rock star, his dad takes him on a vacation. Goofy takes Max to weird places, but Max needs to get to the Powerline concert in L.A. to impress Roxanne again. Throughout the film, Max and Goofy get into fights because Max wants to live his own life. I love the part where Bigfoot dances to the Stayin' Alive song! I highly recommend A GOOFY MOVIE!!!
0374139563|5.0|Finally !! someone willing to tell the truth about \\"Aid to Africa\\"<br /><br />very inportant book to read.
015626224X|5.0|This is a work of autobiographical fiction (which includes a pretty fair statement as to what was adjusted to fit things together into a smoother narrative), set in 1933.<br /><br />What's striking to me as someone who works with poverty and poverty related situations for families and individuals is how much of what is described in 1933 makes a new kind of sense of what's going on in 2009.  For one thing, the so-called \\"old fashioned way\\" to help the poor was dreadful and ineffective on practical and moral levels -- the Salvation Army comes off pretty well in this account, but overwhelmed, and most other church groups do not, at all.<br /><br />In many ways, you read this and take a different view of how we respond to poverty today; more to a startling point, you come away with an awareness that the so-called \\"coarsening of the culture\\" has more to do with visibility and awareness than it does with any new view of life and decency by the poorer and less advantaged end of society.<br /><br />What i didn't expect was how \\"familiar\\" this culture of \\"barely getting by\\" was in terms of urban and rural Ohio today.  You'll have an eye-opening experience on every page of this relatively short and immensely readable book -- but don't read while you eat.  Orwell is off-handedly stomach-turning on almost every other page (think the Ministry of Truth cafeteria descriptions from \\"1984\\", and put them throughout the book).<br /><br />But what can put you off your appetite is the realization that these are descriptions of how people still live, just a few miles or even blocks (or doors) from where we live right now.
B00197POXG|5.0|\\"Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman\\" (DQMW) is one of my favorite TV series ever.  Since the series ended in 1998, numerous fans in the US and abroad (myself included) have been waiting with bated breath for the series to be released on DVD.  Over the years, certain episodes and individual seasons were released on VHS and DVD, but fans of the show were never able to own the ENTIRE series on DVD ... until now.     DQMW was the type of series that caught on with viewers from the get-go.  I was completely hooked from the first time I saw the DQMW Pilot on January 1, 1993.  The Pilot was so well done and I enjoyed it so much that I couldn't wait to tune in for the 2nd episode, \\"Epidemic,\\" the following night.  Apparently, I was not alone: DQMW defied all expectations and became a hit with millions of viewers from the beginning.      The series featured the character of Dr. Michaela (\\"Mike\\") Quinn, a female doctor from Boston, Massachusetts in the mid-1860's.  Faced with the impenetrable glass ceiling that frustated women doctors at that time, Dr. Mike relocated to the Colorado Territory on the old US frontier.  There, she adjusted to her new life in Colorado Springs, adopted the 3 orphan children of her deceased friend, dealt with the townsfolks' initial mistrust of a \\"lady doctor,\\" and encountered the brooding, mysterious \\"mountain man\\" and friend of the Cheyenne Indians, Byron Sully (\\"Sully\\").  Eventually, Dr. Mike gained the respect and friendship of the townsfolk, the familial love of her children, and the undying, romantic love of the elusive Sully.  As a series featuring a pioneering, educated woman (Dr. Mike) finding professional, emotional and spiritual fulfillment in the face of tremendous odds, DQMW provided a positive role model for many young women.       The series addressed a variety of timeless topics, such as: Race & gender discrimination; physical & psychological diseases & cures; death; the effects of modernization & technology; family issues; growing up & teenage life; politics & US history; financial issues; romance (lots of it!); and marriage, pregnancy & childbirth. DQMW tackled it all (and then some!), all while preserving its status as a family show that could be enjoyed by viewers of all ages.     As a hopeless romantic, I was (and still am) a huge supporter of the epic romance between DQMW's lead characters, Michaela and Sully. The Michaela & Sully wedding episode was an \\"event\\" that I'll never forget. Joe Lando and Jane Seymour were pure MAGIC together onscreen, with an acting chemistry that comes along only once in a blue moon.  Simply put, they just don't make TV series like DQMW anymore.      After a few years of surviving on Hallmark channel reruns of DQMW (until 2005), and the occasional internet clips, I recently fell in love with the series all over again when I bought this Complete Series Megaset when it was (finally!) released in the Fall of 2008. I've watched the entire series again from soup-to-nuts, and the 2 movies, which are included in the Megaset. And I've been reminded of why I adored DQMW in the first place.  If you were a fan of DQMW back in the 1990's, you're looking for a quality family show to share with your kids, or you're a hopeless romantic, the \\"Dr. Quinn\\" Complete Series Megaset is for you!
1400082773|5.0|While I haven't read the entire book yet, I have enjoyed what I have read so far.<br /><br />Barack is very thoughtful, intellectual and well spoken through out.  I have had to research numerous phrases due to his expansive vocabulary.<br /><br />The book seems well laid out and the events are easy to follow.
B000YAA68C|5.0|P.S. I Love You -- Wow!  I first saw this on a friend's tv and became addicted to all things Gerard Butler!  The next step was to take delivery of a Netflix copy of the movie (which I kept until my copy of the dvd arrived!).  Since then, I have purchased a copy for my daughter and shown the movie to friends.  It's funny, tragic, and over all perfect!        My thanks go out to everyone involved in making a wonderful movie!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|After playing it for the first time I had to buy it! When we play we usually play 3 games it's so fun. Each game is unique so there's no set strategy, which allows new players to easily join in. As my friends said the first time, they lost but they had fun losing.    Only downside is that the pieces don't fit into the border very well, but with a little work it fits well enough. Not a serious detractor from the game.
B0007TKNII|5.0|Strangely enough, I missed seeing this movie when it was released to the theaters.  Now, having discovered it, I'm a complete fan!  Gerard Butler is fantastic as the Phantom; his masculinity, the power of his vocals, the physicality of his performance are all part and parcel of a perfectly realized roll.  Emmy Rossum is lovely, with a vocal range that is very pleasing.        I purchased the single disc first and then went back to find the two-disc set.  I have about worn out both in the short time that I have had the videos.        I thank profusely the director, Joel Schumacher, and the creator of the music/producer of the film, Andrew Lloyd Webber.
0553381687|4.0|While I was reading this book I couldn't help but feel a sense of deja-vu. I felt like I already knew some of the characters. It soon dawned on me that this book borrows a great deal from another epic tale, The Pillars of the Earth, written by Ken Follett. Now I am not trying to knock this book or say it isn't deep, because it is. All I am saying is those of you who claim this is a great leap forward for the genre are in for a great suprise! It is kind of like discovering a really large lake only to find out there is an ocean right next to it. So rather than go into an extensive review about this book, which has been pretty well covered by the looks of it, I offer you all another awesome story instead!
1401216676|5.0|Comic books are often handled as a medium geared towards children, with men in capes flying around punching other men in capes.  Writers like Alan Moore deconstruct the superhero genre in their works like \\"Watchmen\\", and shed new light on characters and events in books like this \\"The Killing Joke\\".    Moore and artist Brian Bolland set out to tell a tale of The Joker, Batman's \\"arch-enemy\\" and the simple idea that all one needs to become in the state of madness that represents this man, this white-faced, green-haired man, is just one bad day.  Criticized, by some, for having done some of the most heinous things in comic books-- including the crippling of Barbara Gordon, who was once Batgirl, but is now Oracle-- this book shows the characters as flawed, human entities in a way that was never seen before and will never be seen again.    This hardback edition, the \\"deluxe\\" addition, is a recoloring of the original 1980s work.  Fans of the original may remember the almost psychedelic feel of the book, with colors floating haphazardly, almost a form of madness in itself.  Bolland, who did not approve of this, re-colored the book to his fancy.  The recoloring is more sterile, a frightening take in and of itself, but I found myself longing for the scenes of odd coloring during some of the more emotional and psychologically challenging scenes.    On the whole, though, this is one of those comic books that many people should read.  Fans of Batman, fans of Alan Moore.  People who, simply, want to get into comic books.  I recommend it to everyone like that.  You won't be disappointed.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Not only is this movie hilarious, the commentary and making of features just add laughs. If you enjoyed the movie on its own, don't hesitate to buy it on dvd.
B001UREJWM|5.0|It feels so good to hear this band still making great music.  This one is HEAVY, the familiar power of Butler on bass, great riffs by Iommi and thundering drums by Vinny, then the guy who I've loved since Rainbow days, Dio, leading the group with still astounding singing.  No speed metal or death growls here, just thick slabs of old school metal.  May they stay together for years to come.
B000002GQH|5.0|Has anyone else ever noticed that Graeme Edge plays practically the same drumbeat on Mike Pinder's \\"Have You Heard\\" as Ringo plays on the Beatles \\"A Day in the Life?\\"   Just curious.....  This is really one of my top 2 favorite Moody Blues albums.  The other one...that's a little difficult to pin down, though Children's/A Question/Seventh Sojourn are all competing for the spot. I strongly disliked \\"Days of Future Past.\\"  That collection of songs was just embarassing. \\"Threshold\\" is another animal - entirely, and has some of the best songs they've ever produced!  The Moodies remain my guilty pleasure of the late 60's and 70's, when I was just 9 or 10 years old and taking in every single note, chord progression/chord change and harmony after endless listening sessions to their great songs!  HIGHLY recommended!!!
B000OYC3J8|5.0|Well, i'm a bit embarrassed to have just heard of this band less than 3 weeks ago. I feel like i've missed a lot, must have been hiding under a rock. I love this band! I bought this CD right away after hearing \\"Little Cream Soda\\". I was shocked to find out this CD came out 2 years ago, i'm a bit taken aback, the music is familiar, but different. They definitely have classic music, garage, metal, & folk all wrapped into one great package. Being born in the late 70's, I don't recall jamming out to 70's music, but it kinda reminds me of the old style rock n' roll, but this certainly isn't your parent's music! I also have heard GBMS & Elephant as well, also just as brilliant! What can I say? I'm hooked!!
B001FOPODS|5.0|This video is fantastic! I used it in my Peter and the Wolf Unit with 6th graders and they loved it.  They laughed at how fat the cat was and the antics of all the animals.  Great way to encourage listening to classical music and introduce the concept of music telling a story.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|My package was sent on the day after the purchase and arrived here in Brazil in great conditions some days later. The seller used FOUR layers of package hence it arrived pretty safely. The item is better physically than in the online post. Thanks Entertainment Emporium. You made a really good job in my transaction.
B001TH16DS|5.0|The tag line says it all.. \\"Where no man has gone before\\" When this show premiered on TV, it was groundbreaking for numerous reasons. One it was science fiction in space like few had imagined before. It had a diverse crew of different personalities and races during a racially provocative era. It featured an Alien as an important meber of the crew. When you watch these episodes, you reminded that many of these ideas have been used and reused alot since they originally came out. Even today, some of these episodes hold up to today's sci-fi. Kudos to releasing a beautiful transfer as well.
B000W91RUG|5.0|This is one of the best shows on TV and I couldn't wait for the DVD to come out.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|My husband and I just finished this series and we both absolutly loved it!! We weren't sure there was life after \\"Battlestar,\\" but wonder of wonders there is! This show is not really like Battlestar except for, its about people their struggles and triumphs, flaws etc. its just good TV. Interesting, funny and characters you can bond with! Why was this ended so soon!!??
1416550542|5.0|A little girl, left alone, with a little white suitcase, on a dock in Australia.  Who does she belong to?  What is her name?  What is there not to love with an opening like that?  Throw in some beautiful fairytales, and you have the makings of another exquisite novel by Kate Morton.<br /><br />This is a multigenerational search to find who Nell really was.  It may be somewhat confusing at the beginning, but stick with it because once you're familiar with Ms. Morgan's storytelling, the pages will fly by and you won't want this story to end.<br /><br />I pre-ordered this book almost immediately after reading her first novel, \\"The House at Riverton\\" and I'm so happy to say that I was not disappointed.  Kate Morgan is a great new author and I can't wait to read her next novel and what type of surprise she has in store for us.
014144116X|5.0|Beautifully written. this book's main character is not one person or even persons; it is the Anglo-Indian relations of early 20'th cen India; a story of hubris in men, easily riled, and a domineering government. written during the bridge between romanticism and realism, it is supremely realistic - showing the bare bones of humanity and nature,it is unromantic. Also,it is laced with oriental mysticism - which is not glamorized; merely allowed to appear briefly. a masterful work.
0385340567|4.0|Having read all of the 11 previous Jack Reacher books, this one started a little more slowly and wasn't quite the \\"grabber\\" of the others, though eventually I couldn't put it down until the end, just like with the others.
B0009W5K0Y|5.0|This cd is better than the first! I love, love, love it! If youre depressed about your love relationship, youll identify with most of the songs!
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|Good movie all around.  By now you know what it is about.  People will hate it or love it because of Walt's colorful use of language.  You know what, he hates everyone.  He has no prejudice in his life, he just doesnt like anyone.  Big difference.  He has a name for everyone, even his friends so I personally dont see a racist here, just an old guy that speaks his mind.<br /><br />Well done movie.  Enjoy it for what it is.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|I love this series, if only they could finish it cuas it had so many posibilities.
B001PPGAIA|4.0|Very good movie a bit long but good over all. very nice scenery of Australia.
B000PTYPAC|4.0|The cd is very good althogh is a bit raw because the band is still starting...overall is good!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I purchased this because I was looking to build muscle and I am seeing really good results. I haven't been keeping track of my weight (not looking to lose any) so I can't comment on that part.   I like that it does not require tons of room or props. Since it comes in 20 minute blocks, it's easier to convince myself to suck it up and do it every day, because I don't have to carve out an entire afternoon or rearrange my schedule. The moves are all fairly simple ones everyone is familiar with: jumping jacks, push-ups, crunches, etc. You do each move in 30 sec-2 minute bursts so you don't even have time to get sick of crunches!  The people complaining about her style being too harsh or the music being annoying.. just hit mute! Sometimes I want to listen to something else, too, but that doesn't mean I'm going to forego working out.  Highly recommended. I feel healthier, my muscles have strengthened, and I can be confident that I'm always getting in at least *some* exercise every day.
1439102813|5.0|Still Alice was the most compelling, heart wrenching true to life story about Dimentia.  This provides the reader with a clear understanding of what the affected person is going through.  I have recommended it to my family and also my nursing colleagues.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|I saw the movie atleast 5 times. It is a must see. I enjoyed watching the movie each and every time. I always learned something more whever I watched the movie
B0002JP4L4|5.0|This movie is awesome...                                               Coming from one of the best decades ever, having an incredible soundtrack, great acting, and a unique story line- this movie is one of the best ever & will continue to be watched by every age group for years to come.    The movie brings back so many memories for me...  I still get just as excited watching it now, as I did back in the day!    Lori Singer and Kevin Bacon were perfect for the roles and what about Chris Penn's performance??? he did a superb job...    This movie never get's old  and is just plain AWESOME!!!    I hope they put it on bluray disc...    Thanks for reading my review...
B00127RAJY|4.0|Although I enjoy a good cardio dance class, this is a great program because of its simplicity. It is NOT hard to learn the moves (in fact, you probably already know them). It is NOT difficult to follow or even memorize, but it IS challenging. You can feel it working immediately and just when you think you can't take anymore, it's over. I would definitely recommend this to a beginner looking to start a fitness program or to someone experienced with fitness looking for a good toning program.
B001U0HBPG|4.0|While watching The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, I kept thinking of Tim Burton's \\"Big Fish\\" as both movies are about a man's incredible life story. Unfortunately, afterwards I felt depressed.The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is such a sad movie - like Titanic or 7 Pounds. But, none the less it is a beautifully filmed movie and the acting is excellent.[[ASIN:B001U0HBPG The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (Single-Disc Edition)]]
B001EN71DQ|5.0|If you are a star wars fan, you must have this movies.  three movies for an excellent price...good deal!
0767903862|5.0|This book is great very entertaining.  I purchased the book because I am planning on moving to Australia and wanted to get some perspective on what it was like.  Besides an a slight feeling that I will die because Bryson constantly reminds you of the creatures in the country that might kill you; crocodile, snakes, spiders, etc.  I am very excited for my future trip to Australia.  I was also very happy to find that he did not concentrate on just Sydney and Melbourne but all over the country which not many books do.
031606792X|5.0|I realize that many people like stories to hold true to reality, which means that happy endings are usually frowned upon, unless a great price is paid---like the loss of many beloved characters.    Well, thankfully, Meyer's didn't care one whit about those type of readers! She wrote this book just as beautifully as she did the other three in the series.  I was left on the edge of my seat the entire time, from the first page to the last page.    First, who says that in order to be realistic an author must sacrifice a happy or pleasing ending? As much as I loved the Harry Potter series, I was immensely disappointed with the ending.  Thank goodness Meyer did not disappoint her loyal fans with an overly painful, tragic ending or an ending that failed to live up to climax of the entire series.      Second, for those who crave reality...why bother reading a fictional book about vampires then? I live in reality every day, I have no shortage of disappointments and struggles.  Reading the Twilight Saga---and Breaking Dawn, specifically---allowed me to escape reality and enter a world that was full of adventure, excitement, love, loyalty, bravery, sacrifice, and commitment.    There was sacrifice in this book, and just because the ending turned out FABULOUS for loyal readers, does not mean that the sacrifice was absent or without price.  In fact, in this final book, all the sacrifice that each character endured throughout the series paid off in a very gratifying way in Breaking Dawn.  Why bother sacrificing, if there is no hope or faith that the goal will be attained?     Meyer did not hand deliver a happy ending to Bella and Edward, rather it was Bella and Edward who made their own happy ending by having enduring faith, love, and trust in themselves and in those around them.  They fought for everything they loved right up to the very end.  If anything, this final book was about the very real power each of us has to create our own destiny and make our own happy endings.  It was amazing to witness Bella discover her greatest weapon against those standing to destroy the whole Cullen family; and that weapon was her deep love for those around her.      This series, and this final book, were outstanding and I cannot give enough stars.  I read all four books in a matter of weeks, despite a full-time job, college, a husband, and two kids.  After just completely Breaking Dawn, I now see where I need to go back and read the whole series again.  There are too many details, too many moments that I know will have greater meaning now.  Excellent book!
0385484518|5.0|Having my friends recommended it, I bought the book few years back and it is still an inspiration to me every time I read it. It's a thin book yet it teaches us alot about to live our lives.<br /><br />Normally people would go depressed when diagnosed with terminal illness, instead, he still thinks of others and even be able to relate with others suffering. He embraces death and accepted it so that it doesn't fear him<br /><br />What a man, what a story !
1400079179|5.0|The Da Vinci Code is a brilliant thriller that keeps the reader engaged, excited, spellbound, and breathless.  Brown's writing is flawless.  He is a master at weaving fact and fiction so closely that they almost blur---almost.  However, The Da Vinci Code is a fictional book that is meant for entertainment, not religious study.  There were many ideas that the character Robert Langdon expressed as fact, but Robert Langdon is not a real person, he is a fictional character in a book of fiction.  In the Twilight Saga, by Stephenie Meyer, Edward states many \\"facts\\" about his vampire coven...but that does not mean that vampires are real!<br /><br />So, as long as the reader can set aside their own beliefs for awhile and enter the world of Robert Langdon with an open mind and a heart set on adventure, then Brown's books are sure to please.  I immensely enjoyed the thrill ride, and I eagerly await the third book in the series: The Lost Symbol, which will be released in September 2009 (according to [...]
B001EBC8U4|2.0|Telling a story through letters is not unique.  If you want to read a book where that is well done: read the Last Days of Summer by Steven Kluger.  This started out with good intentions--history of the Channel Islands and their occupation by the Germans for five years.<br />Unfortunatey the authors turned to romantic musings thus making this book into a romance novel without much substance.

B000GGSM7G|3.0|I can't comment on the reissue, but I've owned this album for years, and here's what I think. Although \\"The Top\\" is innovative enough to warrant four stars, I've always found it hard to enjoy, so I hardly ever listen to it. That's why I only give it three stars. If you're a big fan of The Cure, though, it is worth owning, as it is the halfway point between \\"Pornography\\" and \\"The Head on the Door.\\" It contains some of the gloom of the former, but in terms of musical styles, it is just as eclectic as the latter.     There is a pretty strong theme here, which is the uncomfortable relationship between spirit and body. The top is a metaphor for that, as it is like our body, having to stay in motion in order to survive, and ultimately doomed to fail. Animal images pervade the album, as a look at the song titles shows. Most of these images are creepy, the one exception being \\"The Caterpillar,\\" which is one of the most joyous, hook-laden songs the Cure ever recorded. At the other end of the spectrum, at least in terms of lyrical content, is \\"Bananafishbones,\\" which has to be a reference to J.D. Salinger's short story, \\"A Perfect Day for Bananafish,\\" in which a man commits suicide by gunshot. (Robert Smith sings, \\"Put a piece of metal in your head you said, make you dead....\\")    Contributing to the feeling of uneasiness is the rather vague musical line-up, consisting of Robert Smith (\\"instruments, voices\\") and Laurence Tolhurst (\\"other instruments\\"), plus a drummer and a saxophonist. Because there is no band, the album has no groove and feels like it was assembled one instrument at a time in the studio. That's not a good thing, though for such a disparate collection of songs, maybe it was the only way to go.     Some of the songs are almost unbearable. \\"Wailing Wall,\\" \\"The Empty World,\\" and the title song are all dirges, and \\"Give Me It\\" is a loud, punky jam that disrupts whatever continuity the album may have developed up to that point. There are good moments to be found in some of the other songs, however: the crisp Spanish guitar strums that highlight the chorus of \\"Birdmad Girl\\"; the cascading keyboards in \\"Piggy in the Mirror\\"; the woodwinds in \\"Dressing Up.\\"     In the end, \\"The Top\\" is more of a curiosity than a coherent musical statement. Robert Smith was really branching out here, reinventing the Cure's sound. After the much groovier and more focused follow-up, \\"The Head on the Door,\\" The Cure would return to an eclectic approach a few years later with \\"Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me,\\" again with mixed results. There's no denying that \\"The Top\\" has an important place in the history of The Cure, even if it's a disk that seldom comes off your shelf.
B0009A21R6|5.0|Well recorded, IMHO.  Very enjoyable listening to this SACD in stereo!  If you like the Dire Straits at all, I suggest you buy this.
B001PA0FFO|5.0|The movie is excellent, from the acting to the cinematography.  Beautiful to watch, this movie makes you think.  The DVD comes with director commentary.
0143038419|4.0|When I finished the book, I was glad I had read it.  But it took a long time to read it as the first third seemed to just go on and on and on.  The second third was o.k. reading.  The last of the book was excellent and made it worth the time.    It got mixed reviews from  my friends....people seemed to either REALLY like it or really didn't....few inbetweens.
B001GCUNYO|5.0|First of all, when one thinks of a big action star, they tend to have names like Bruce Willis, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and the such spring to mind.  Then there's the typically quiet and reserved, yet strong character that Liam Neeson plays in so many films. ([[ASIN:B00012QM8G Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition)]])([[ASIN:B00013RC84 Nell]].)<br /><br />Every once in a while, however, a story and script come along which gives the likes of the powerful gravitas Neeson brings to the screen which allows him to kick some serious BUTT.  \\"TAKEN\\" is such a film.<br /><br />From the get go, we get a few things thrown at us about this great man, loving father.  He's meticulous, he adores his daughter (even though he and his wife split long ago and she now lives with his ex and her new multi-millionaire husband.)  We also learn soon that he has a very unique past wherein he's a retired spy.  And throughout the course of the film, we find out that he's a very WELL-trained former spy.<br /><br />This movie is easily one of the types that normally last around 2 hours plus. One beautiful thing about this film is the fact that it doesn't go too deep into the characters backstory.  We don't know what the true reason was for the breakdown of the marriage, how did the ex-wife get with the millionaire? What group of spys did Bryan Mills (Neeson's character) work for, etc.<br /><br />The point is, we as the audience don't HAVE to know all this stuff.  The movie is just there to let us enjoy the white knuckle ride we're about to strap ourselves in for.<br /><br />Near the beginning of the action, Neeson's daughter, played brilliantly by Maggie Grace ([[ASIN:B0019LY5IM Lost: The Complete Fifth Season]]) tricks her father to letting her go overseas.  He, being the concerned and wise father is quite leary about what she's up to and her safety (any parent.)  As it turns out, shortly after her and her friend land in Paris for a visit, they are kidnapped while she's talking to him on the phone. (By the way, this information is in the trailer, so no real spoilers if you're concerned.)<br /><br />From the moment the daughter (Kim) drops the phone and the kidnappers pick it up, the tension is sky high.  We all know Neeson is a force, a hurricane covering a typhooon with tornados embedded in his rage to find out who has taken his daughter.<br /><br />Using his skills and knowhow, he travels overseas to find his daughter and the ones who took her (and her friend Amanda.)<br /><br />Action packed is an understatement for this full throtle movie!  There's so much great about this flick, it may soon be in my top five favorites with the more viewings I give it.<br /><br />The emotion seen in Neeson's eyes, the subtle nuances and grimaces that he flairs upon his face speak volumes about what is going on inside his head, how the cogs of his brain are working non stop on plans A, B, C, D and beyond for his next steps.  Nothing, and I mean NOTHING will stand in his way to getting his daughter back.<br /><br />The cast, as I said, is brilliant.  The script may have had a plot hole or two.  But more or less it's the type(s) which make you just shrug it off and say: \\"Ack! it's just a movie!\\" (the ACK is very important when making the aforementioned statement.)<br /><br />To enhance the nailbiting action, the use of violin music (or maybe cello) really gets the heart pumping, the legs jumping and the fists clenching.<br /><br />Then, on to the editing and sound.  Usually these are two categories which get overlooked by the general public.  However, in \\"TAKEN,\\" it's quite important and quite frankly very hard to miss.  Those punches, thos chops to the neck, the grueling torture is nothing short of awesome.<br /><br />Needless to say, I loved this movie.  If you like action without a terrible amount of bloodshed (I watched the unrated version so I'm sure there was more in that version) and if you like a non-stop thrill ride that only lasts roughly 90 minutes, then \\"TAKEN\\"is certainly the movie for you.<br /><br />Check it out indeed!<br /><br />Watch, and enjoy!<br /><br />Thanks for reading :o)
B0012CJQY6|5.0|I remember this show being on Australian TV a few years back but didn't watch it. After recently seeing the DVD sets on sale at a local department store, I decided to give season one a go. Boy, am I glad I did, as every episode blew me away. I received a buzz similar to that of watching Hill Street Blues on DVD for the first time or seeing NYPD Blue when it premiered on television. The Shield though doesn't have anywhere as much humour as HSB and is somewhat more violent than NYPD Blue.     There are only 13 episodes in the set but the drama and action is in your face. There are times when the strike team cops are heroes and times when they are villians. They'll do almost anything to get results but often leave many loose ends along the way, which have to be attended to in future episodes. Michael Chiklis was born for the role of Vic Mackey.     Soon after watching season one, I went out and bought season two. Took me just a few days to watch all the season two episodes and am now in possession of seasons three and four. Only gripe with my Region 4 DVDs is that I've come across a couple of faulty discs (occasional vibrating/whirring sounds on more than one DVD player) and have had to exchange two of the sets. Still gave my review 5 stars since Amazon.com is not selling Region 4 discs (although did notice that previous reviewer (American?) experienced some problems - is Sony having problems worldwide with these sets?).    Anyway, hold on to your seat and enjoy the ride! One suggestion though: you may want to keep the remote control close by in case you need to refer back to the subtitles after missing some quick dialogue, and so you can turn down the volume of the closing theme music. While the theme suits the show, I do find it quite loud and annoying.
B0015HOFZI|5.0|Recently purchased this item.  I have no complaints so far.  It works great, and it is so nice to be able to play records again.  My only wish is that it could play more than one at a time like the old ones.  One side of a record goes so fast!  I have not used it to create digital files of the music yet.
