B007SGLZP8|5.0|As someone who has read almost everything Grisham has written, I approached this book with great anticipation. I was surprised, therefore, that I struggled through the first 50 pages or so. For some reason, probably more due to me than the skill of the author (obviously), it took me longer to really engage with this story. But once I did, it was a race to the finish!<br /><br />Grisham's skill as a storyteller is top-shelf and he doesn't disappoint with this rapidly-changing story. I most appreciated that while I THOUGHT I knew where the story was headed, I was completely wrong as Grisham headed effectively in a different direction.<br /><br />If you're looking for a great read, and several hours of enjoyable &#34;escape,&#34; you won't go wrong with this.
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|Really not pleased with this product, very poor record Quality and there is way too much cord on this thing
B004GHNIRK|4.0|A little confusing at times....  so many references to French history and personalities....  you need to Google names and events to get all of his allusions.  But - a fabulous story.
B005D63ICI|5.0|Wish Deb hadn't found out though...what is that about. his dark passenger should have remained dark for crying out loud
B00AFROVQC|1.0|I've just finished reading book 3 and I'm tired of buying chapters instead of books. Book 1 was fair and you're left with a cliffhanger, but nothing is resolved. It's not the end of a book, there has been no climax and resolution, it's entirely buildup for the next book. The second book (March of Kings) is even worse, barely advancing the plot and resolving nothing at all, it ends with another cliffhanger. With less than 3 months between the release of book 1 and book 3 this strikes me as nothing more than greed.<br /><br />I will not be purchasing any further books from this author and cannot recommend it to anyone else.
B008CLI3TE|5.0|Game of Thrones is a great ADULT show. Not for kids. Having said that and not wanting to spoil the plot for you I will just say that it is a must watch.
B001UGB1X8|2.0|Not what I thought Dave Robicheaux would be like after reading many of the books.  Rather disappointed as II really like Tommy Lee Jones in most things I've seen him in.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love how it reads for you so smaller children who are unable to read yet can still play without an adult reading it to them.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|it's easy and kills the time and is kind of addicting. and what girl doesn't want her own horse anyway?
B000BYRCGU|5.0|Lots of action and it still has a love story to it. So the men can't complain that it is just a chick flick. It has something for everyone.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|pretty good little game.. im only typing because i have to have at least twenty or whatever words.. but it really is a good game. try it.
B000XR49VQ|5.0|A Found Film<br />I saw this film many, many years ago and it appears that it has become one of those &#34;forgotten films.&#34; I was surprised I was able to get  this thru Amazon and therefore took advantage of it by purchasing it.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love pics art that's honestly all I can say really. its nice to post pictures on my profile and see people take interest.
B008XKT9FG|5.0|This was my first movie on Kindle, and I just loved it! I like Helen Hunt, I liked the clothes.
B007V5CF5K|4.0|This is a fun hidden object game. Intriguing as well. The only problem is there is no zoom feature.  At times it would be helpful if you could zoom the screen.
B002W5UVSM|1.0|I am surrounded by mostly idiots where I work, so having to read about idiots and their actions, was very frustrating and not entertaining at all.
B004WY2M8I|5.0|Very good price for the collection of the vampire chronicles. I really recomend it, im using an iPad and it can be read great.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show so much that I watched ALL of Season 3 in two days!  Even though this ran on TV, it's worth purchasing for your DVD/Blu-ray collection
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved the unique story line, though the ending was disappointing. Cannot put down the book once started!! Highly recommended.
B000V63AVY|5.0|Would recommend to any fans of the great SuperTramp tracks back in the late 70's and 80's. It captures all those tracks and sounds better than the single albums they produced, as it strings all the best tunes together.
B005NJU8PA|4.0|I enjoyed the book, and thought it was worth the money.  I didn't really encounter anything life changing, but I found some of the ideas useful.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I am not too much of a game player, but my girls love it.  Originally had it for my phone, then got it on both their Kindle Fires.  Much easier to play on the larger screen so now even my 7 yr. old is becoming a Surf Junky.
B00275EHJG|5.0|We think this may be the best of the 3 toy story movies.  We love Woody and have the Woody doll in our house (LOL).  This is such a great movie I think it is one of the best!
B001NHNG64|4.0|I am an avid Jack Reacher reader (Lee Childs) and would rate this at 5 stars.  The technical detail and the superior story telling ability of Lee Childs has one more enjoyable read.
B004KD5TQI|4.0|I loved the movie...If you liked the movie, you will like this sound track. Maybe two so-so songs on the whole cd.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I loved Temple run 1, so I was excited when I learned there was a new one. When I found out that it was free, I had to get it. I'm glad I did! It's even better than the original. The effects are much better, the game play is smoother, and I love the new features, like the mine cart. A hundred times better than the original. If you liked the first one, get this one before they realize how much they could sell it for!
0525478183|5.0|John Green is a veyr good author. This is a great young adult novel. I wouldnt say it's predictable. It has good messages in it and I enjoyed it
0762434260|1.0|This thing is a total waste of money. The wand broke within 10 minutes of owning it. Very flimsy and cheaply made.
0525476881|5.0|This book was funny and had an interesting story line to it. The plot is interesting because it slowly reveals things that the narrator knew throughtout the book. just very good overall
B00BHNR1KQ|5.0|This was better than I expected.  Well acted and directed!  Sinister is definitely a good name for this one!  I was not 'thrilled' with the ending.....but that is better than the usual 'lived happily ever after'.
0525423273|4.0|I enjoyed this book but it was a little too predictable and some parts were a little over written in my opinion. BUt I still liked it
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|I am SO NOT an Arnie fan, so this was right up my alley.  Much better than the original as far as I am concerned.  Thoroughly enjoyed this.
0525421580|5.0|I  really love this book. It is definitely for the more mature reader however. But the story is really good and I like the switiching author
B00AB0AR2U|5.0|I will never miss a Resident Evil production and love Milla!  I will say that I liked the first two best, they are not getting better and better, but they are still great!
0525478817|5.0|Not your classic struggle with cancer book, but it is a wonderful story. It is sad but it is also heartwarming and wonderful
030758836X|3.0|this book and a thriller that keeps you wanting to read.  My only criticism and the characters are so psychologically impaired that is loses its realism.
0786955570|5.0|This is a lot of fun even if you aren't familiar with Dungeons and Dragons as an RPG.  A lot of creativity and imagination packed into a complete game.  Only problem is that the later dungeons get a bit hard for just two people to handle.
B000002NJM|5.0|After I saw the movie I had to order this. I could listen to Bobby Womack's &#34;Across 110th Street&#34; again and again. Then there is the ultimate in soul music = Randy Crawford's &#34;Street Life.&#34;<br /><br />The soundtrack is one great song after another. I loved the movie. I love this CD.
B007W1BLN0|4.0|I read the book, and was eager to see this when it first came out.  The story is absolutely compelling - even though I knew how it ended I couldn't stop watching.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really didn't think I would like this book, boy was I wrong .Just could not put it down. Hope the other two are just as good.
B00BGD07KS|5.0|I loved the song and I am a big fan of Mariah Carey. Another great song and her voice is amazing.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Trying to catch up with the new episodes and this one was excellent.  It was worth paying for this one instead of waiting for it to come to USA.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Who doesn't like Angry Birds??? The best game I have ever played. It is a great tension release. Thank you for developing this wonderful game!
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|this is a fun game but the ads are disturbing.  lt test your creativity and I love building things.  I deleted because of the ads.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Simply put, the weather channel can be trusted! I have watched and trusted the weather channel for as long as they've been around
B003JTHXOK|3.0|If you've read &#34;Sleeping with the Enemy&#34;..well, basically this is the same book Still, I loved &#34;SWTE&#34; so I didn't hesitate to buy and read this one too. I liked it and recommended it to a lot of customers (bookseller). The movie is a bit different but still well worth watching.
B00A85EMVK|2.0|I wish I had waited to see reviews instead of pre-ordering the 3D Blu Ray version. As others have stated a good portion of the movie is incredibly grainy as if there was a defect when manufacturing the disc. I'm not sure why they even released it. The quality is that bad. The 3D effect is pretty good for a conversion but still, it is almost unwatchable especially the first 10 minutes which gets you thinking I must have a defective copy...?
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Season 8 has had some great stand alones but still a strong central arc with Crowly and Kevin in the background. Sometimes out of sight but never really out of mind. I'd like to see Cas a little more but at least he shows up more than last year. The Felcia Day episode was a real stand-out as well as the Looney Tunes ep. All in all a much better season that last year.<br /><br />Off topic...has anyone seen the book cover for &#34;Wilder:The Chosen One&#34; by Christina Dodd? You're on Amazon now, take a look at it. Definitely Sam Winchester. Maybe some new money making scheme for the boys? Male cover models for supernatural (what else) romance novels?
B0011Z5IVE|5.0|Excellent album and great price! Led Zeppelin is the best classic rock and roll band out there and continues to rock..
0062082353|5.0|This book is a well writen first person accound of Kris Kyles activities as a navy seal. i was saddened to learn of his<br />murder by a demented marine who he was trying to help.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Good. Not as good as books two and three though.  IMO. Can't wait for a movie sometime soon. N j
B009IEXKXI|5.0|A fun and fascinating story, written with humour, imagination and detail.  This is a great example of science fiction escapism at its best.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This is my second fav. I like the second the best. Good love story.  They are poorly written.  Some can look past that.
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|This is easy to you and when you need to just write down something quick this comes in handy. I recommend this !
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This was my fav of the three. I liked number 3 also.  Like the love story the best.  J m
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Greatest book ever. Buy it and buy all the other books too. Why does it matter how many words I use?
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great game me and my 12 year old love it.  Never played Temple Run one but this one is a great one!
B0027MJU00|5.0|I cannot wait to read more books by Gillian Flynn! They keep you wondering and guessing! Great story lines and characters!
B00999DFP0|5.0|Wow, this is just awesome!!! I love this program and I got this for my husband for his Valentine's present....well it was perfect. He loved it.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Cubistry  am officially addicted to this game. Enjoy an easy--don't have to think much--relaxing game. Bright colors & interesting shapes.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I use this app all the time and find it very useful.  I would recommend it to keep tabs on your battery usage.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a nice horse game. Im just crazy for horses and this game is fun to play. Though it still doesnt really make me feel like i have my own horse, haha, its still pretty close to do that. Also i think this game had a price on it before, but now its free! :D
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Spoiler Alert!<br /><br />I love Downton Abbey but I'm a little irritated that every time a character gets pregnant someone dies... think about it. Cora? The baby died. Sybil? Sybil died. Mary? Michael died. I mean come on find another way to add drama Masterpiece..
B00920HMNM|1.0|DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS HORRIBLY ILL CONCEIVED, POORLY WRITTEN ALBUM.  This piece of awful DREK is not worth wasting 40 bucks on...not even 11 for a CD.  Fagen and Becker are two OLD AND TIRED CURMUDGEONS with horrible attitudes.  It is NO wonder that Fagens girl kicked him and his Kamakirid to the curb.  Fagens voice is old and faltering he looks like something from a skid-row cardboard box.  Notice no image of him on Sunken Condos.<br /><br />In a nutshell...save your cash for a REAL ARTIST with talent and a more cheerful attitude.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Great album, unfortunately it got stuck in my cars rapid changer and I'm unable to use it,Adele is amazing. Doh,lol...
B002QKZLZ6|2.0|Unnecessary. I found the carry case fo the Voyager pro is not very usefull. Save your money and just carry it in your pocket or purse.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I love this album! Bruno has such an amazing voice and he is so good to see live in concert. I love every song on this cd, except the one that has a reggae sound to it. The only thing I wish that he would do as an artist is release more songs on an album rather than all of his previous albums that have 10-12 songs. It is definitely worth the purchase!
B000FS9FCG|5.0|Big Brother in Britain.<br />A futuristic look at an old story.<br />In the not to distant future a great orator<br />takes control of the government<br />and tyranny reins till our boy &#34;V&#34;<br />has had enough.<br />Highly recommend this to anyone<br />who wants to see where America<br />&#34;could&#34; be going..
B005IQZB14|5.0|What a story!  I am at as loss for words.  I loved it.  I recommend reading this book.  It is uplifting.
B001IXXYBA|5.0|very good love story, NOT a chick flick<br />just a good old fashioned love story with a twist<br />kinda makes ya think about things....
030758836X|5.0|Loved it! Story was so well written with a million twists and turns! Great! You will not be able to put it down!!
B000063V8U|5.0|liked the whole series<br />but forgot some of these stories<br />till I watched them again.<br />It was like seeing an old friend.
B0073XV2W2|4.0|Not as good as Daemon and Freedom but still a good &#34;techno-thriller&#34;.  Looking forward to his next one whenever it comes out.
B00000JGHS|4.0|if you like Demi, and I do, you'll see plenty of flesh,<br />but this was NOT her best work as an actress.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|If I wasn't a no,ad I wouldn't be writing this review. :) But I am, so I am here to tell you that this is a great show and I am happy to pay to watch it.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|would have given it 5 stars but it get s little glitchy on my kindle sometimes. love the game very fun
B000001FDP|1.0|Hello Amazon!  YOU HAVE SENT ME A PIRATED COPY, please find your supplier and find out what happened.<br />This is suposed to be a compact disc from Polydor, istead i got a well printed, but pirated CD-R, the logo is also wrong...<br />Very strange!!!!<br /><br />I hope Amazon send me a proper copy, so I can add the 6 stars Vangelis Deserves for this album!
B008IYR2BA|5.0|wish i had showtime so i could be up to date, I was able to see the first episode of season 7
B00821PCJS|5.0|Great show!  Hopefully it will play for many years. Love shows with a theme, hate all the reality shows just for the mindless
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Just loved the whole time travel idea as King presented it....and I'm a child of the '60's, so I remember that day well.  Great story!  King at his best!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Works just as advertised. Cable is extra long. heavy enough to last a very long time. The price is great!
B0084U0IEG|1.0|Although &#34;I hate it&#34; seems strong I just couldn't give it more then 1 star.  I was looking forward to a good spy novel but this one did not live up to its expectations.  A bit difficult to follow in sections and just never really deleloped into a good read.  Last chapter was excellant but that does not make up for the rest of the novel being flat and unenjoyable.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I am not sure what the resaon was why I did anything with this product? Google is Google. it is everwhere, so...... It works good?
B00846F1YW|5.0|I like this game. It keeps my interest. I have only had it a week and I am on Level 8-9. I shared it with my Daughter in Law and she loves it to. I think it is a game that I can play with my grandchildren and they will love it. I have tried some other mystery games and lost interest easily.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|As far as zombie apocalypse stories go, this one makes the most sense on how it might really go down. On a world level, which I have never really thought about, every country had to try to control the spread and eventually fight back on their own terms. Well written and an enjoyable read.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Great page turner. Not knowing anything about Dom/Sub it was interesting to learn what it was all about. Not my thing but loved the book.I
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Character involement and story like keeps the audience coming back. As usual the British hit it spot on, as many of their shows are then copied by US television.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|II like It but there should be a block that u can win and get 1,000coins and I don't lie when u bump the side u losses coin
B00571F26Y|5.0|Dr. Davis puts forth a convincing argument for why our whole grain, wheat-based diets are making us all heavy. While the scientific information may be a bit difficult to digest, the proof is in the pudding with this one.  Try going wheat-free for two weeks and you will be amazed at how different, and good, you feel.
B00025ETIW|5.0|This is my favorite cd out of the albums by My Chemical Romance. It's an awesome cd and I listen to it every day. It also didn't take more than maybe a week to arrive after order.
B001HYY35G|5.0|I watch this whenever i need some motivation when working on music and it work every time.  Great documentary about a great dj duo.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|I like the idea of  \\"glamour\\" hiding the true nature of things that only  super natural beings see. Since I was able to determine the future of this couple, I would like to continue reading about their journey.
B004UBB3KQ|5.0|Not really much to say.  It's a great album and the vinyl came in great shape.  the product was taken care of.
B006X5L6VS|3.0|interesting app, recently used to try  and follow asteroid, didn't work very well.  Constellation identifiers disappear to quickly sometimes.  fun though!
0425252868|4.0|I was very interested to read this book. As it turned out, this was really the story of the German fighter pilot's life. It was a truly interesting read even if it was a bit misleading in the headline. The incident with the American Bomber was also very interesting, but consumed only 10 minutes of the German's flight time.  That aside, it was a fascinating look at WWII aviation, by a person who clearly knows what he is talking about. This inside look at the Luftwaffe was very interesting. And some of the equipment insights were very revealing. For example, for all the reading I have done about the war, and movies that have been shown, I had no idea that the crew had electrical underwear similar to an electric blanket to keep them warm. (It took 40 years for this to make it to motorcycles). But above all is the contrast between the Luftwaffe's moral code and the conflict this encountered in the Third Reich. The flying policy of Germany was; &#34;Fly till you die&#34;. It is amazing that any of these pilots survived. Even the American statistics will drop a jaw. For example, the Eighth Airforce lost more men in WWII than the entire American Marine Corps. For those who are interested in the war, this is a rewarding readk.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|This is a pretty cool game. I really enjoyed the great graphics. The hide and seek games were very interesting and full of fun. I would recommend this game to all my family and friends.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|One thing that I can safely say about this is that it is exceptionally<br />Good price !! It is not only addictive a really fun to play but dosent cost any money or drag you in to buying anything if you are wondering weather to get this<br />App I would strongly 100% recommend it
1451673442|5.0|This book makes you think about all that we have, that we are not grateful for.  It gives instructions<br />for 28 days of being grateful and saying thank you for every thing in our lives.  Shipping was fast<br />and the book arrived before estimated time.  Good read!!!!
B00AHSF4AQ|5.0|I think this is the cutest movie ever!!! My son and I can't get enough of little nemo and dori!!!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This one was more 'sit at the edge of your seat' thriller. I could not put it down and devoured it in 3 days... it took me that long only because I was forced to put it down and spend 8 hours at work each day! The only thing I wished they would 'figure' out is how a mortal and a caster can be together!! It's killing me that he nearly dies when they start getting close. I know, I know, it's a young adult novel, but I'm tired of being stuck at little more than hand holding. Still great series. Currently in the midst of Beautiful Chaos and loving it as well. I will be sad when I do finish the series. These books also have a ton of great quotes, if you like that sort of thing... which I do! I highly recommend them all.
B0096HIEE2|5.0|Love Channing Tatum and the dancing sexy men in the movie lol!! Who wouldn't like to watch dancing men taking off their clothes!??
B00338QENI|4.0|This story was very interesting and well-written. It gave me some good insight into how cell research happened starting from the early days. I felt a connection with Henrietta Lacks and her daughter Deborah. Good read.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Runs fine on my Kindle Fire. Relaxing and addictive.... and at times quite challenging. I laughed several times due to the funny comments and the descriptions of agents and weapons.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|This is probably the best explorer  that Amazon has to offer.  It will more than likely do all that you will ever need.  That said, everyone needs at least one explorer on their tablet.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Very well written. I loved Slammed & Point of retreat  also written by Colleen Hoover...who is now one of my favorite authors! I was engaged from the get go.  I highlighted so many sentences that I thought my Kindle might combust! I wish I would have been so wise as a 17 year old!
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|This movie is pretty much the best thing to come out of the new millenium. I'm not particularly fond of the first film because of the extended plot and unreasonable acting from some lead females, but I would say that the third movie is a perfect closure to this film.
B004ZGI1V0|5.0|I thought the movie held my interest, it is exciting and vrey interesting. I would see all the movies he makes I thought he plays the part very well.
B003VANOFY|5.0|YOU CANNOT PAIR THESE WITH YOUR PHONE OR IPOD<br /><br />At time of review I have owned and used these for two solid days (2/21/13)<br /><br />I bought these wireless headphones after listening my coworkers Wireless Beats by Dr Dre. I was turned off by the on-ear design, overall look, and price-to-quality comparison. I knew I could get and equal or better quality headset for far fewer dollars. You could almost buy THREE of these for the price of one of those. I'm not a huge &#34;sound guy&#34; but I know quality when I feel/hear it. While some reviews said they did not think these had true surround sound I did not find them to be lacking at all in that department.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Inexpensive (not cheap!)<br />Great weight. Not too heavy, but heavy enough to feel expensive.<br />Very comfortable. The band has just enough cushion with the right kind of give and the noise cancelling ear pieces fit over my dumbo ears without irritation.<br />Great range and sound quality for wireless headphones<br />Good bass<br /><br />Cons (important to note that I still gave these 5 stars just the downside of buying these):<br />No bluetooth connectivity to phone or mp3<br />USB not auxiliary so you can't even wire them in to a phone or mp3 player<br />No fancy stand that charges it like similar options<br /><br />tl;dr: A great set of noise cancelling, over-the-ear gaming headphones with quality sound and great control (thanks to the volume roller on the side). My co-worker is returning his Beats for a pair of these.<br /><br />Have already recommended these to friends!
B002BI6SMI|5.0|I am still happy I bought this movie and unknown and Taken 2. This actor  holds your interest through the hole movie. I continue to buy what he plays in. I could watch his movies many times and still want to see it again and I do.

B008TRUDAS|5.0|This book was so beautifully written and continually made me laugh, love, cry....box of tissues are needed. I loved the poetry written and how each perfectly fit into the scenes.<br />This is definitely a true love story with so many powerful life lessons weaved into it.<br />Loved every second of reading it and literally could not put it down...well, I did have to pause to put the kids to bed so I could finish!<br />Defining a wonderful, love life kind of book!

030758836X|2.0|I rarely purchase books, I have plenty from publishers that I need to read for reviews, however I have seen so many positive reviews about this book, even one that said, \\"If you only read one book from 2012 read this one.\\", so I bought it.  What a waste of my money.<br /><br />This is the story of Amy Elliot Dunne and Nick Dunne.  Amy is the only child of author parents who used her as the model for the Amazing Amy books in which the character is a better example for handling the real Amy's childhood problems.  The characterization between Amy and her author parents is probably the only one in the book that is well written and believable.  Nick is supposed to have his own dysfunctional family, in the form of a misogynistic father and over-indulgent mother.  The author shows this by having the father show up from the rest home at various times asking about Amy using obscenity.  She might have written about the relationship between the father and the mother with cancer.  However, it was so incidental that it did not make an impression on me, all I remember is the irritating, constant,- I only know how to show this relationship by showing the same thing happening over and over.<br /><br />Nick and Amy are both unemployed when Nick's mother develops cancer so they leave New York and move to Missouri.  Nick borrows the last of Amy's trust fund money, the rest she had given to her insolvent  parents.  Nick and his twin, Go, buy a bar with Amy's money.  On their fifth wedding anniversary Amy disappears.  There you have the opening of the story.  Telling you any more will spoil it for anyone who does want to read it.<br /><br />This sounds like an interesting story, so why didn't I like it? I believe books that are \\"if you only read one\\" usually will have extraordinary prose that makes you stop and say, \\"I love how the author put that\\".  None of the writing in this book is something that you would remember as remarkable, but I could forgive that if it didn't have so many other things I found difficult to get over.<br /><br />It is a slow start.  If a book is interesting then I find I cannot wait to get back to it.  I was well into the book and could have easily put it away without caring what happened to these characters, but I have learned to keep reading that often a book gets better.  Well it did get slightly better, but still not much.  I never really cared about any of the characters.  There were irritating, never developed characters.  I have already mentioned the father, the over-indulgent mother with cancer is just an after script, it was insignificant when she died.  These under developed characters do not make the character of Nick believable.  I think the author spent most of her time developing Amy.  She is more believable.<br /><br />This book is written in chapters of one perspective from Amy then a chapter from the perspective from Nick.  Without giving away part of the mystery let me just say that it is difficult to follow where and when the characters are in the story and  what it means to the story.  The author tries to explain this later in relation to Amy, but she does some of the same kinds of things with Nick and that is never explained.  I think she meant them as flashbacks, but I am not sure.<br /><br />The author does quite a bit of time explaining how the meida influenced this case.  I am not so sure that she didn't wirte it just to make this point.  Nick's lawyer, a cliche, helps him with his unemotional media appearance.  There is also the woman who goes after Nick because he seemed to have killed his wife and then there are  pictures of him talking to women who were helping hunt for Amy.  This is all so cliched that it is difficult to even read.<br /><br />The ending, there are many people who hated the ending.  I am not one of them.  I don't love the ending, but I do think it is probably a realistic ending.  Truthfully, I didn't care enough about either of the main characters that I cared about the ending.<br /><br />So there you have it, would I recommend it, no.  It is certainly not one of those, if you only read one book read this one.  I often work with people who do not enjoy reading.  This is certainly not a book that I would give to those kinds of readers.  In my opinion this book would  encourage those feelings of reading as something that they do not enjoy..<br /><br />So there you have it, would I recommend it, no.

B000FA5SMK|4.0|Very entertaining story but a lot of details.  They do all come together though.  It was very unrealistic but that is why it is called fiction!
B0095P31L6|1.0|This was the slowest kids movie ever!! We couldn't even finish watching it that's how bad it was. Don't waste your time.
B0064W65UM|5.0|A very interesting dystopian look at what our world could be if we're not careful.  It's all fiction, but it illustrates the dire consequences what fear, apathy and lack of participation in our own democratic society will  lead to.  Good story and thought provoking.  I'd never read a graphic novel before and I wasn't sure what to expect.  I was pleasantly surprised.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I got this app just for the camera feature on the kindle fire hd but have found many more uses for it.
B00486UF52|5.0|I have traveled to the UK many times and have friends there and I often found myself scratching my head at times in trying to figure out English culture.  There were a number of times I exclaimed, &#34;Oh! That's why they do that!&#34;  It explained a lot in my sometimes awkward interactions with the English.  After reading the book, I took another trip to England and had a much easier time of relating to people (and they to me.)  We speak the same language, but our cultures are very different.  If you are and anglophile, travel to England frequently or are and expat living there, I highly recommend this book.  I enjoyed the very humorous writing at times.  It's a book on modern English cultural anthropology, but as dry as that sounds it was well written and highly entertaining.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This series is well written and acted. I've watched it for the past three years and cannot wait for the next season to air here.
B00B0NDQPC|5.0|Best ever in the history of the world. I love it & all my friends love it. It is the best. I had to type this many words in order to post a review.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I first downloaded this app on my Iphone over a year ago and loved it. I was really excited to find it for my kindle, and with the bigger screeen it's even more fun!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is a wonderful book. The beginning took me a bit to get in order in my head, but from there on it was great. It really makes you stop and think of your life and the people in it. It is worth the money and time to read! You will recommend and pass it on, believe me!
0425263908|5.0|Crossfire trilogy is amazing.  Couldn't put the book down until I was done.  Gideon I feel is a better man then Grey.  You will fall in love with the characters.  It is in the same theme as Fifty shades, but I feel it draws more into the life of the characters.  The passion and intensity that Gideon has is truly amazing.  His troubles in his past have caused issues in the sense that he acts out<br />during his sleep, but the reader can only guess what his issues are.  I can no wait until the third book is out so we can find out what his troubled past really is.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It's got all the blood, guts and violence you can stand, along w/the necessary elements of love, suspense, perserverance, determination and true grit. It's survival of the fittest at it's best.

B001NHNG64|5.0|This was a fun and easy read. Plenty of action, humor and mystery that is given at a good pace to keep you itching for more.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The first new episode was a bit shaky but the second one kicked it up a notch,  this panning out to be another awesome season
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hmmmm...what if this really happened? I liked how the series was written..sucks the reader in right from the get go.
B002FQOI0A|4.0|I t was really good and a little hard to follow but I understood in the end. I liked all the twists sand turns the authority in the book it's better that way :)
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I liked it because what I was able to go back in time. If I could change something what are the repercussions? This explores that that theory. The details of what led up to the assination of Kennedy were presented accurately with the facts. I also read Killing Kennedy so I know what I'm talking about. A very good story, but a lengthy book.
B003XRELGQ|5.0|My first Vonnegut read, but it will not be my last.  Good story telling, humor, excitement, satire, character development, the list goes on. I definitely recommend.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The story seem to flatten out near the end.  Some parts left me hanging.  The two previous books were in a class of not being able to put down
B0016OM3TU|5.0|I've loved this movie for years, so I thought I'd check Amazon to see if it was available.  It was, and the price was very reasonable so I ordered it on the spot.  I'm happy that I now own this movie.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I couldn't put it down.  I was looking forward to the next  book. It was thrilling. Wish there was a movie coming out to the end of this adventure.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|The game is addicting and reminds me of the original mario! so much fun! i could play it for hours!
B0036BK6MW|5.0|We need to see more of this type of film. I loved it and have watched it several times which is very rare for me.  It showed that one can live up to his potential.  The family had high standards and expected the best from each other and I was inspired by the mother's courage and great love.
B009BJAZBA|4.0|I tried this show because I had finished the Downtown Abbey series. It's not as deep or richly detailed as Downtown, but still a lot of fun to watch. Wish there were more episodes available, though.
B001HBYH9Q|3.0|I love Julia Roberts but the story was not really very believable to me.  And the ending tied things up too quickly.
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|The airlines investications ends with worn elevator. The investigation on the pilot's drug or alcohol would not be given to the public.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have this on my kindle fire and I really lo e it. It runs smoothly without any problems :)
B005S9EJ14|2.0|Nothing particularly special or memorable about this movie. It was dull, predictable and the dialogue wasn't even interesting.  I truly don't know why this is up for awards.
B00A31UXLW|4.0|I have read most of Michael Connelly's book and like the characterisation of Harry Bosch. It is easy to read but holds your attention all the time. Good Read.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|This is one of the most boring books I have ever laid my eyes on. It's popularity is best explained by mass hysteria
B007ZXK08C|4.0|This book was slow to start then was &#34;couldn't put down&#34;: but I hated the ending. It was recommended by family members and they unfortunately agree with me.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|This is the best greatest hits album I ever purchased! Every song is fabulous and shows Clarkson's range and evolution as an artist.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|This was the first Kate Morton I have read. It was a great read. I look forward to reding more of her books
1423395301|5.0|This is as good as the written copy and each time I read or listen to the audio book I find something new or a better understanding of the book. As I am collecting the entire Honor Harrington series in the MP3 format  this was a missing book and it was well done by the reader.
B005PK56TA|5.0|I sat and watched the whole season in 2 days. Probably not for everyone but I loved it! Good and creepy!!
B008YU0AOE|3.0|My grandson needed a calculator so he downloaded this. He seemed to say it worked to wat he needed it to do
B003UBTX6S|5.0|In love with this series! I was even more in love with this one than the last. Can't wait to dive into the next book!

B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great book as always from N. Sparks. He deals with real life situations, I just wish he's change the covers, it always looks like the cover of a Romance Novel, thank God for Kindles.
B00004RJ71|5.0|this is my husbands #1 fav. movie. even though i do like this movie i gave it a 5 because of my husband
B003Y7AR7C|5.0|I love Miyako and Iohna. I've always dreampt of wearing tights and being the sugar pulmb fairy, and I'm a dude!
B009369Z8A|5.0|This movie was very interesting, and it kept me at the edge of my chair and had all my attention.
B0050XFY4O|5.0|This film is truly amazing, it's a great love story. Aside from the fact that they are brothers, it's an amazing story of how they grow up together , face hardship together, and learn to trust and love eachother unconditionally. They go through the same feelings and emotions that any couple can have and its just amazing. Totally worth watching.
B0052U59F4|2.0|Ok, I actually read this when it was a fanfic and it was better as a fanfic. I actually enjoyed reading the fanfic. The book? Not so much. First of all, I know every female in America has jumped on this erotic/BDSM bandwagon, but there is so much better erotica out there people! I don't see the pull of this story. Christian is a neurotic and pompous man, and not in the &#34;he's so bad, he's good, I just want to eat him up&#34; kind of way. Ana was an annoying, lip-biting, wavering, immature mess of a heroine. What killed the story for me was how she was not a submissive, trying to fit in to the submissive storyline. I get that she didn't like it, it's not for everyone, but she should have just walked away. He is obviously into it and she knew that, so don't try to change him. So infuriating! By the time i was 80% through with the book, I was having to make myself finish it. I didn't even care what happened to the two of them or their realtionship by the end of the book! Needless to say, I did not read the second or third in the trilogy. Let me just add that the only way I will see the movie is if they cast Ian Somerhalder as Christian! lol I would watch that man crochet a blanket for entertainment.
0307279189|2.0|Getting right to the point, I didn't like the book, \\"Born to Run.\\"<br /><br />It is  not that I didn't find the Tarahumara indians interesting. Nor the topic of ultra long-distance running. Nor do I disagree with the author's views on modern running shoes; nor his views on the evolution of man and the relationship of this to early man's  technique of hunting by running prey to exhaustion.<br /><br />Simply put, I think the book was poorly written, poorly organized and used  a \\"hip\\"style of writing that I found off-putting. Our great-nephew, Kevin, saw me reading the book yesterday and asked me if he should read it. I told him \\"no.\\"  I've changed my mind. I want him to see for himself  a form of narrative prose that he should avoid like the plague.<br /><br />Fifteen years ago, Rose and I took a trip to the Copper Canyon and I learned quite a bit about the shy Tarahumara. I even still have a souvenir, a ball made from a tree root, that the Tarahumara kick through the canyons with their bare feet. I don't recall precisely whether we ever saw a true member of the tribe, but I do remember vividly our Caucasian guide telling us that the tribe had been hunted and abused for centuries by Mexicans and that the tribe members had had to  hide out in these wild canyons.<br /><br />The author, McDougall, tells us at the beginning that in \\"Tarahumara Land,\\" there is no crime, war, or theft; there is no \\"corruption, obesity, drug addiction, greed, wife-beating,  child abuse, heart disease, high blood pressure or carbon emissions.\\"  Wow!! This must be another \\"Shangri-La.\\" All human evils eliminated.  The author makes this claim but never produces a single fact in the rest of the book to back it up. In essence, McDougall's Tarahumara are just another hackneyed version of Rousseau's \\"Noble savage.\\" Civilization corrupts us and we neeed to get back to our roots, etc., etc. (But read James Hilton's novel for the sleazy underside to Shangra-La.)<br /><br /> McDougall, instead of telling us interesting facts about the Tarahumara, fills his book with stories  about himself and other misfits who come to \\"Tarahumara Land\\" to learn their secrets. Among the misfits who he describes in endless detail is \\"Caballo Blanco\\" who very much reminds me of my deceased younger brother. This brother never quite fit in in America, and besides drinking himself silly,  endlessly traveled  to remote parts of the world where magically, he hoped, the natives would recognize his genius.<br /><br />McDougall then spends whole chapters on American long-distance runners who come to the Copper Canyon to learn the Tarahumara secrets. This cast of  \\"incredible\\"characters is more interesting than Caballo Blanco, but the authors infatuation with them seems largely based on the fact that they all are hippie-like, heavy drinking \\"party animals.\\"<br /><br />In the final chapters, McDougall finally dispenses with his hip language (which seems more appropriate to teenage texters) and gets down to telling us about the importance of running to the evolution of man.  This is all well and good, but he never does get back to telling us the real story of the Tarahumara. I, for one, would have been interested in that story
B0052VUNHC|4.0|Oh Travis! I loved his character. He was smart, funny, sexy, witty, tough and sweet all rolled into one big muscled up package. There is something about a man who is basically a man-whore player until he meets that one girl that turns it all around for him that makes all of his past transgressions ok! Abby, on the other hand, was just ok for me. I thought she kind of led Travis on, but it ended up ok. The only reason I did not give this a 5 star rating is because I felt like there were two storylines in the book. The first, being the underground boxing venue, which I found fascinating by the way, and the second, with the whole Vegas/gambling/weird father arc. I though the book could have done without that whole part. It was a little bit too much. Overall I loved it. I would recommend it, and have to several of my reader friends.
0525953728|4.0|The recipient said this was a very good book, believable and gritty. It was then passed on to another veteran.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is a wonderful series. I think the stronghold to the whole series is Katniss. She's such a strong and powerful character, in and of herself. For me, she shines right off the pages of the books. Peeta is the perfect compliment to Katniss. Where she is Alpha, he is Beta, where she is hard, he is soft. But he has no problem stepping up to the challenge when the need arises. The story building of the world is fabulous. The overall message of the series to me is that if we all become desensitized to society and the world as a whole, then what is the point? Are we all just cattle being led blindly and acceptingly to the slaughter? Or can one bright shining light in the world of darkness lead the way for everyone? It send a very powerful message that I think behooves everyone to hear.<br /><br />I would and have recommended this trilogy to several people, pre-teen, teen, and adult.
B0090CVJZ4|4.0|These speaker bannana plugs are well made and sturdy, especially for the price.  The design leaves a little to be desired, but the funcionality makes up for it.  Just strip the wire, stick it in, and tighten down.
B005ZO6NRA|5.0|Love him wish he were in more movies great actor!<br />The movie was a great movie fighting, love, hot body what more could you ask for.
B002KS1IJC|5.0|This is one of those movies you find and enjoy so much you wish you could share it with more people.  I loved the characters in this film, the vikings, the outlander himself (jim caviezel did an amazing job) and even the morwen; an amazing and terrible creature.  All of the acting is on point ,and combined with the scenery and plot, will really whisk you away  for an hour and fifty five minutes.  To be fair, there are some cheesy moments here and there, but it's important to suspend your disbelief, and open your self up to the experience of this film as a fan of phantasy, action, and mythology; and not watch it like a hasty critic picking out every tiny flaw.  The Outlander combines several genres, a risky business, and does so very well, give it a fair chance and you'll be impressed.
B0066WJLU6|1.0|I can't give a positive review because the app was never sent to my phone. I am not happy at all!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is just what I was looking for.  It does all the basic calculations and is as big as the screen so it is easy to read.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The best series PBS has ever done. It has a compelling story and great characters.<br />I started watching in 2010 with series one. It is so nice with Prime that I can now watch it on my new tv.<br />Thanks Amazon.!!!
B0054IOWTS|3.0|Great scenery, beautiful locations, a packed with action and thrills.<br />A twist between every corner. James Cameron pulls off another great thriller
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this thing. It's so much easier to check the battery life with thus than to have to go into the menu settings!!!!!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I am still in the process of reading the book.  I am at chapter 5.  I am a 48 year old spinster.  I can relate to the female character in the story.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I can't put it down. Can't wait to start the next book. Not my cup of tea, but living it through Ana's eyes is &#34;OMG!&#34;
B00B2166BS|2.0|As far as the charging aspect of this item goes, yes it is faster. However the quality of this charger is poor, I had it 3 days before the casing that houses the pins fell apart on me when it hit my nightstand trying to connect it to my nexus 10.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|First of all I like Blueray Quality, both picture and sound. I really like that the discs have both versions origional and directors cut first movie and special edition for the mext three movies. However I would have really liked this box set if it included Promethus. I already own Promethus Blueray so it wasn't a deal breaker for me, although if you don't own Prometheus, you might want to wait for the next version of this box set. When Prometheus came out it revived an old set of movies which in my opinion is a must have with this box set. You already knew that or you wouldn't be reading my review.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I got hooked on game of thrones when I saw it advertised on TV a couple years ago now, since which I've watched the TV show religiously, and now I finally came back to read the books.<br />This book is very well-written, especially for an e-book edition. It has a very deep and engaging storyline, and it was better than watching the show, in my opinion. Martin did a supreme job of describing everything so thoroughly and completely, and it is very easy to picture the events unfolding in your head. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys the historical fantasy genre. (I struggle to use &#34;fantasy&#34;, as it is very accurate for a Middle Ages Britain, but fantasy it is with the dragons and 'Others').
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Less the fact that the video freezes up at least once per episode (a problem my friends and I all have with Amazon videos), season three is awesome. I always find the introduction of new characters off putting, but they've managed to do it seamlessly. The plot twists are riveting and will have you hungry for more! Can't wait for season four!
B009G7ZYPY|4.0|Every one of Susan's albums, so far, has at least one stand out. For this one, at least for me, The Winner Takes It All is the stand out. For the rest, her clear voice is still wonderful, but something seems a bit lacking. Still, every song is enjoyable.
B005LAIHR2|5.0|This wasn't too bad.  There is a lot of talent and a good story line.  No regrets on my purchase.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It was an amazing well written book. Suspenseful and mysterious kept you on the edge of your seat!!! Absolutely loved it!
B007SGM084|5.0|Love this trilogy!!! So pleased with story and how it progressed, pleasantly surprised at the ending. Also enjoyed the supplemental reading.
B0092FEVBS|5.0|I read the novel many, many years ago and did not allow myself to read it again, just so the story would more interesting.  The acting was excellent and the costumes authentic.  It was very enjoyable to watch the story come alive.  The photography was beautiful and I was able to &#34;feel&#34; the grandeur and lonliness of the moors.  I would recommend it to any reader whose has a preference for the period.
1409136612|5.0|Vintage Maeve Binchy, but with a twist:  you weren't looking at an Irish behavior, but at the human condition as a whole.  Told in a humorous way, Binchy illustrates what is going on in entirely too many homes around the world.  If I had a complaint, it would be that the book was too short!
B006I1OB0U|5.0|I have bought many DVDs set in the same time period; the end of the Edwardian way of life and the effects that WWI had on the lives of the people living in that period.  This DVD will become one of my favories.  The story, the authenticity of the clothing and the beginning of the end of a way of life for the wealthy, land owing classes all combine to make this a gripping, joyful, yet sorrowful<br />end to the season.  I had already viewed, several times, my copies of the two first seasons and was happy to find that this special show was as good as the rest.  I have placed it with my favorites and viewed it 3 times already.  I am not a TV watcher and do not especially enjoy going to the movies.  I would recommend it highly yo anyone who enjoys seeing a period in history come to life.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Great CD.  The misses LOVES it. ...... ..... ...... ...... .....  ...... ..... ...... ...... .....  ...... ..... ...... ...... .....

B00B5HQLMI|5.0|I've enjoyed this series of Bond movies with Daniel Craig so much more that any in the past; this one is the best yet.  I love the nods to previous versions of Bond as well.  You get a little more of Bond's history.  The return of previous characters almost making it feel like you're going to start at the beginning of the franchise with the next one, fully understanding who Bond is combining what we were given with CR and QoS.  You won't be disappointed; even better you'll fully enjoy it!
B006JPS1OM|5.0|I like this game because I like solving mysteries.  It is fun and entertaining.  I just wish I could continue playing after I purchased the full version.  Hope this problem can be resolved soon.

B00AMBK0X4|3.0|My boyfriend liked this movie better than I did. I've seen it twice. The first time was funny but the plot tries to get too dramatic for a talking teddy bear movie. Its ok and a good movie to watch as a couple, but I wouldn't buy it.
B0050UEVU0|3.0|Not one of his best. Drug out and typical plot. Only 97 mins. long .............seemed like the story lacked substance. But then again, how long can you drag out a cop killer movie.
B009YQJ322|5.0|It's too bad this movie was preceded by that Stallone piece of garbage. This movie was great. It kept to the dark and uncaring world of the dredd comics. Some folks complained about the Judge uniform, but they need to remember that (A) this uniform did resemble some earlier variations seen in the comics and (B) they wanted to give the movie a more realistic feel that anyone could accept, not just prior readers. Other folks complained about the Lawmaster (Judge's motorcycle) but there's nothing you can do about that. There's just no way to build that and make it rideable. There were other nitpicks, but the bottom line is they did an excellent job making a movie that pleased readers and non readers. For those who wanted a little more insight into Dredd and Mega City One politics, lets hope they make a sequel.<br />Just get the \\"Judge Dredd\\" movie out of your head and give \\"Dredd\\" a chance. I bet you'll be glad you did.
B000A7DVRC|5.0|Jeff Bridges at one of his best. Gotta be of this era to appreciate the characteristics of the actors MAN!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|First, This I bought the book because of the recent killing of Chris Kyle and I wanted to learn about him. This is the first book I have voluntarily read in about 3 yrs and I finished it in about 30 hours of actual reading time (and I'm a slow reader). This book is phenomenal and I have already recommended it to 5 people who are currently reading it. Very easy read about a true American Hero.
B001ER4CSO|3.0|First movie was better. If they make a 3, they better go back to the first movie and make it a better continuation. More action less drama!
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Dislike... It don't look like the ones I seen....and I don't use it cuz i don't like it and it looks like it has been used before
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|I  think it is a cool game I am a fan of minecraft but i like this better. I think that it does nee  more time but I am thinking of getting the full game. In creative mode I love it. But in any other modes it is hard. I like how you can make New worlds.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I really like this game, my only problem, besides expanding being so pricey, is running out of gas before getting to rescue the animals. Other than that this game is fun and cute!!! And a bit addictive.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this second version has much better graphics. ropes and mine cars are very challenging. I highly recommend getting this upgraded version.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Same thing. Temple Run 2 is ok. I guess it's still better than Brave Temple Run and the original. But at the same time it's not like... OH My GOD I MUST HAVE THIS APP! I mean you know?
B00005N6KG|5.0|[[ASIN:B00005N6KG Sony Ultra Lightweight MDR-W08L Vertical In-The-Ear Headphones]]These earphones are the greatest.  I use them with all my sound devises (Computer, CD, Smart Phone and Touch Pad) you do not have to try and cram them into your ear and the sound is great.  They also work well with people that have hearing aids which I believe no others qualify for this use at least the small type that fit in your ears.  It would be nice if they had a model with volume control.  This is a winner and deserves high stars.
B008MM9630|5.0|Fun game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Everyone should play it. You taking care of plants without getting dirty. Isn't that everyone dream... it give you some thing to do when your bored
B00821OX98|5.0|good story good acting  mostly believable  good filming good watch like to watch several in a row for continuation  more please
B0060MYM7O|5.0|We went shopping and saw that &#34;The Season Two&#34; was released.  We were unsure of whether our AMAZON &#34;Pre-Ordered&#34; DVD set had arrived and it on sale from $34.99 to $24.99.  We thought, &#34;What I deal&#34;!!  So, we grabbed this set, thinking the two sets would be the same.<br />&#34;THEY WERE NOT&#34;, Your &#34;MUST BUY THIS SET FROM AMAZON&#34;.<br />This set of Amazon's not only includes Blu-Ray, DVD and Digital Copy but the &#34;BEST PART&#34; is that it Includes &#34;EXCLUSIVE BLU-RAY FEATURES&#34;, Interactive looks at the &#34;Wars of the Five Kings&#34;, &#34;Histories and Lore&#34;, &#34;In-Episode Guide&#34;, and what I am excited about the most, &#34;Hidden Dragon Eggs&#34; (they state it uncovers never seen before content).<br />There are even extras:<br />Experience the &#34;Creating of the Battle of Black Water Bay&#34;, &#34;The Religion of Westeros&#34;, &#34;Audio Commentaries&#34; ( w/ 12 Cast and Crew including our FAVORITE ACTORS and last what they call the &#34;Inner-Circle of Game of Thrones&#34;, which are where 5 of our favorite actors speak of their experiences while shooting the Second Season, in a roundtable discussion.<br />Last but not least, it gives you the &#34;7 New Profiles&#34;.  Uh! Oh!, Let me say, the new actors better &#34;bring it on&#34;, even though I hate that saying, but, because we lost so many of our favorite actors &#34;The First Season&#34;.  These new guys better make us fall in love fast given that we, as the watchers, were not only shocked but even heart broken over &#34;The First Season&#34; actors.<br />Good thing HBO had a great final episode for 'The First Season&#34;, otherwise, I would not have been as thrilled about &#34;The Second Season&#34;.<br />&#34;HBO&#34;, knows what they are doing when it comes to their Series shows, being that I am a &#34;True Blood&#34; lover too.<br />That being said so does &#34;Amazon&#34;, when it comes to just about &#34;EVERYTHING&#34;!!  But of course their&#34;Movie/DVD&#34; sales and options.<br />So by saying all the above, it is all said by just looking and reading the differences between these two sets.<br />Letting you know that the &#34;EXTRA $10&#34; you thought you were &#34;SAVING', would be a &#34;GREAT LOSS'.
B002RI9ZQ8|5.0|I think that The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a fantastic novel. Book store owners will be pleased to know that their Top Ten Best-sellers display led me to pick up a copy of Larsson's first novel from a genre I rarely ever venture into. Like many other reviewers of this novel, I also found the first part of the book heavy going but this back story only aided the plot the deeper you read yourself into the twisting storyline. I was soon hooked and immediately ordered the second instalment. Larsson's ability to handle a multitude of plots and characters was formidable. However, I cannot pass up this opportunity of recording my appreciation of the leading character, Lisbeth Salander. Surely she will go down in the history of crime fiction (or maybe all fiction) as being one of the most interesting and complex characters ever to grace the printed page. Sadly, Larsson's marvellous writing talent was too short lived.
B009H442DG|5.0|Love them, still together.  Sounds great & was timely.  Would suggest to anyone.  Lots of fun to relieve this duo.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|After hearing about this book for a couple years I finally purchased it and was pretty disappointed. The entire first third of the book seems almost completely unrelated to the rest of the book and I was very bored. Even then I just never connected with the character and although it was somewhat entertaining the only good part for me was the way it ended, but even then I had a sense from about halfway through that it would be something along the lines of what it was. It wasn't horrible but it wasn't good either.
B007FROH4G|5.0|I would recommend it to anyone who has to work  with a person who has a similar problem.  It helps one to understand them<br />much better and have more empathy with their problems. I found it a great book to read .
B007WKEM8C|3.0|If you love, love, love desserts, this may be the cookbook for you.  I am more of a savory gal, and I found just one recipe (pistachio end lamb chops) that I might try. I was thankful that I could preview this cookbook through Kindle from Overdrive.com.
B009UZBLSG|4.0|Is working great i don't care to much about the image quality, for me is doing the job, BUT!! After pay 30 dollars for this i was expecting something a little better, actually im afraid someday is going to peel off or something.
0374275637|4.0|I gave this book to my college-aged son for the holidays. He has been picking through it and shared many insights.
B009VB7P6G|3.0|While cute, and in some odd way about climate change, I was a little disappointed that magic solved all the problems in this movie. I LOVED Tinkerbell and the Lost Treasure for it's messages of a) bad things can happen when you lose your temper and b) your brain and not magic can solve your problems.  This movie, however, is mostly magic.  I think there was a real missed opportunity at the end to have Tinkerbell live with the results of her decision and thus be able to go live with her sister.  Would have made a powerful ending but it's a Disney movie so magic rules.  And it could have had a little more about fairy activities and climate change and jet streams - through a little science in with the movie and they wouldn't even notice.  So, not my favorite Tinkerbell, but not bad.<br /><br /> ( I loved the way Dewey channeled that old SNL character of Father Guido Sarducci - made us old folks laugh.)
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I am addicted to this game!  very simple concept.  would like to see an update that maybe gives multiple cubes for a harder level. can't put the kindle down!
B0083DJWGO|5.0|It's deep, it's thorough, but also witty and readable. The book delves into how to design strategies for thriving in the most risky and uncertain times. Like today.
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|Roderick Rules is a very good book to have in your collection. I really enjoyed this book, I look forward to reading more of them. I would like to recommend this book to Jeremiah Williams.
B000SEFNMS|3.0|Interesting story about a off-his-rocker young man who goes off into the wild and starves to death.  There I just saved you from having to read it.
B005CRQ4OW|1.0|If you want your role model (or your child's role model, for parents) to be a whiney, blame-everyone-else kid, then this is the series for you.  I don't recommend it unless you just need an example of what NOT to be/do.  This is one very self-absorbed kid.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|best game ever! much better than the first one. I got it<br />last week and immediateley loved it. GREAT JOB<br />IMANGI STUDIOS! AWESOME GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0054LJGWS|5.0|This book is brilliant from start to finish.  It is always my go to book when I need something to read or just a quick perk-me-up.  The writing is amazing and the story line is brilliant.  This book really was my introduction into both Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett and I have not looked back since.<br /><br />The story starts off simply enough with a premise: there was a mix-up at the hospital.  What happens when that mix-up happens to be the anti-christ and, well, not the anti-christ...  apocolyptic humor happens, and that is simply the start of it all.  From start to finish the book is amazing.
B004T4KQJS|3.0|As a generally skeptical person I was very interested to here the explanation for the title of the book. I was disappointed to read the author define &#34;nothing&#34; early on as actually something namely empty space (which by its nature is something) or the rules that possibly define the multiverse. So the whole book sounds like a really hard fought effort for an atheist to pass off the real question that I think everyone understands when they ask it. BUT this was a well written book that gives a great overview of our current understanding of the weird and incredibly interesting universe we live in.
0425252868|5.0|knew the story, the book filled in the blanks.very well written, the photos follow story, helps to get better insight of story
B005KELQEU|5.0|I am very impressed with the quality and it is even more stylish than I expected. I would recommend this if you want to read your kindle without a cover.<br /><br />I have a paperwhite.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The ending was disappointing. Glad I have access to the third book right away. If not I may go crazy. Huge twists throughout the whole thing.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This was such a good book.  I was rooting for Travis and Abby from the start.  I want to go back and re-read it!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|this game is sooper fun....my kindle has a hard time making him move side to side but thats the only problem unless wanting to play it all the time is a problem
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great ending to the series.  Some people don't like it, but I did.  If you have read The Hunger Games and Catching Fire, this is a must read!
B0070Y46UY|1.0|Still trying to figure out how this book relates to the movie everyone is raving about, I am stuck on the first portion of the book, Pi is telling the readers all about life in India.  So mundane I couldn't get beyond the second chapter.  I could have written a much more action pacted book about my life.
B0094K1MH2|4.0|Very enjoyable movie, good for the whole family.  A little weird the way the past and present converged.  People are rarely that enmeshed in their family history.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I like Bad Piggies.The pigs are funny when they go down hills.It makes me go crazy.I hope the creaters are reading this.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I couldn't put the book down for any length of time and stayed up late at night just to get a little closer to the end. There were many surprising twists and turns and many tears toward the end.I have to say this is one of my favorites so far!!!
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This game right here is one my favorites.I can make hair better than ever before.I do wish it had a full version.
B003Y5H5C4|5.0|Not only is Danny McBride the man but you got Nick Swardson in the movie. Tons of laughs come out of this movie, if you're into abductions and whatnot.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I am reading this story to my children  who are 3 & 8. I try to encourage them to be open minded and accepting in general and this book falls into that category. I love how the author managed to express feelings and humor that were written almost like they really were from a child's mind. I went from moments of laughter to moments of tears. My daughter who is 8 was captivated the entire time by this book! Strongly recommend this book! amazing story...
B000ICZD5M|3.0|This first attempt to bring Frank Herbert's science fiction masterpiece to the screen after decades of &#34;development hell&#34; is too condensed and fragmented to be called a great film.  Moreover, viewers who haven't read the book will find it an incomprehensible mess.  For those who have, however, it's still a fun romp.  How can you not like a film that features Patrick Stewart (before he became Captain Picard of Star Trek fame), Jurgen Procnow and Sting?
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I was immediately hooked on this page from the very get go!  It is a little predictable, but it is told in such a cute way that it doesn't matter.
B001EBWINQ|5.0|Perhaps no movie in history has the staying power of \\"Casablanca.\\"  It's as good the 100th time you see it as it was the first.  This tale of love, betrayal, heartache and redemption features some of the most iconic moments in cinema history, the most memorable lines ever spoken on screen and a cast to die for.  It belongs in everyone's video library
B00881VLCE|3.0|A little hard to move some of the pieces some of the time, but otherwise it's a great way to train the brain / eye coordination.
B0092MKFIY|4.0|Great music, worthy of the top charts for sure. I just want more of it; when's the next album coming out, guys?
B006WQLH7G|4.0|I am using Avast for virus protection only on one of my computers, and it's great.  It updates and scans in the background never slowing down or interrupting anything I am working on.
B00136Q6DA|3.0|I got this album because I wanted to see what else Sara had besides Love Song (One-hit wonders usually have some good stuff that no one caught on to). There were a few other songs worthy of a 5-star rating, but only one or two. The rest of the album seems to consist of filler songs, still good stuff though, a worthy buy for $2.99
B001FB5634|5.0|Awesome movie, keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Makes you wonder about the future and what is going to happen
B009G8GRX6|4.0|I've always loved Muse. While this album appears to be quite different from their previous ventures, I thought it was a great leap forward for them. I love hearing new and different music from bands and this definitely hit the sweet spot! I'm not giving 5-stars simply because to earn that, I have to really be blown away; as a musician, I don't really believe that music can achieve a perfect score so 4.5 is as high a rating as I can truthfully give. Great job guys, can't wait for more!
B00999DFP0|5.0|I love this show.  This is the only tv show that I have purchased the dvds for.  I can watch them again and again.  These came in perfect condition.
B00594XOZU|1.0|So i logged off to let my friend check hers and then it decides to not let me log back on or create a new account this used to be my main reason for my kindle :( now i am so sad and MAD &gt;:( please help this problem be fixed!!! PLEASE! Kik Team please! At the moment i wouldnt download it tho. My opinion :/ very disappointed at the moment. :/
B006CQLGXG|3.0|An excellent classic. A great writer but from the point ot view of the subject a bit dated. Anyway it is worth reading and I enjoyed it.
0765325950|5.0|After waiting so long to read the final book of the series, I had pretty much resigned myself to the fact that it would be an all around disappointment and a horrendous ending for a series I absolutely didn't want to end.  Nonetheless I began to read away, and I was surprised at the great pace the book kept.  I was never let down from start to finish in that aspect, and never felt that need to trudge through a few paragraphs here and there to get to the 'good stuff' like I did in some of the previous books in the middle of the series.  The book's central focus is basically on battles.  I am honestly shocked at how many 1 star reviews this book received simply because of that fact, because what did you really expect a book about &#34;The Last Battle&#34; to be about?  Besides, a healthy dose of battle means a healthy dose of Matrim Cauthon, which is always awesome right?  It's a book full of struggle, sacrifice, and pure determination to survive, fun from start to finish.  The writer does a good job in making the reader feel some emotion with some of the major occurrences in the book, which helps to leave a more lasting impact after the read.  I also love that he cycles through some great minor characters that we haven't seen as much of in a while.<br /><br />If I was to have any disappointment with the book, it would be the actual confrontation between Rand & the Dark One.  I can't really elaborate because I'd rather not drop major spoilers, but basically I expected a bit more excitement involved.<br /><br />All in all, a fantastic read.  I think it flows well and has a great story.  It finished a great series in a way that for once, didn't leave me wanting to punch a wall endlessly for 20 minutes.  I absolutely recommend this book(and this series) to anyone who likes a great fantasy read.  Enjoy!
B00AMBH70S|4.0|ok show. Not as good as some of the other ones. All for now no more works to write ok
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love it! Love it! Love it! I never thought that a show could be so realistic and scare the crap out of me! Great acting. Great story. Pretty true to the comic. The best show on TV!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0094K1YHK|5.0|I just love this movie. It succeeds in doing what the Indiana Jones franchise was only mildly successful at. That being an updated version of the B movie adventures that I enjoyed growing up. Great visuals and dialogue. Overall, just a big whopping can of cinematic fun.
B008M721MS|5.0|Works perfectly. You can chat see your other friends and family. Now I can chat with my sister and uncles. The kindle fire VS is great. I'm so glad. If you were having second thoughts about getting it. Then yes you should.definitely get it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game! I play it all the time and its a great way to pass the time
B004SBS8LA|5.0|It is awesome game.  I got this because (at the time) the game was free.  and it was ad-free. score.  Great game!
B003CHGV74|4.0|Just when you think you've seen it all here comes the brilliant writers of Breaking Bad. It always surprises, totally original.
B003FSTN5C|5.0|My friend wanted this really bad for her birthday, and the prices were all extremely high, so after seeing this at the discounted price I had to buy it for her. She loved it and everything worked great.
B004EPZ070|4.0|lAlthough this is obviously a film for chicks, I enjoyed the performance of the actors, and it was funny and pretty human.
B0049VVE7Y|5.0|This is a great show and I recommend it to all my friends and have not heard from a single person that says the don't like it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a great game. easy to play and lots of fun. highly recommend. a bit timely. in loading but not too bad.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A very good inside on what it's like for cancer children to have to endure on a daily basis! Very good read!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Intrigued by best-selling status and one-line description, bought ebook and read. Reminded me of ex daughter-in-law. Surprise ending. Can't recommend because of foul language. Should be R-rated.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|For a film version of the broadway classic it is very well done. Anne Hathaway and Hugh Jackman are amazing, as is Marius (forgive me I can't recall his name). I didn't feel R. Crowe had great vocals (again compared to the musical cast) however he wasn't awful. Also, what he lacked in vocals he made up for with acting. If you have never seen the stage production, you will fall in love with Les Mis when you watch this film. If you have see Les Mis, you will enjoy this new version.
B004EPYZSK|5.0|First of all this is my first review but I have to say this was a very entertaining movie.  The movie might start of slow but the characters are given time to develop that is all. I hope Hollywood makes more like this.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Very gripping.  I wanted to read more.  This book was upsetting to read but also satisfying. I find myself thinking about it long after finishing it.
0307895475|3.0|Delivered on time. Bigger book then expected(over 1000 pages) Covers most aspects of the game, thought the index could have been better and you need a magnifying glass to read.  DOES NOT COVER GLITCHES IN THE GAME, or command codes to fix. Really, that should have been the first priority as the very opening scene tells the player to join a side in the war which glitches the whole game.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book is interesting and filled with allegories and symbolism which makes for lively discussions with other readers.  The ending gives everyone an opportunity to explore possibilities and interpretation.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this is a great game! I have had a lot of fun playing it :) only bad thing is the coins take a bit to regenerate but that isn't that bad I would recommend it to a friend!
B009VYF5E2|5.0|It was a long time waiting for them to release it in the US but it was worth it.  This is a great show.
B009AP2G26|5.0|As a household with a teenager, it's a program we can all watch and enjoy! The singing and dancing is particularly good.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Loved this book. I have read all the books in this series, and I can't wait for the next book.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Homeland, just completed season two and I can't wait until the new season which will probably start in late September.  It is one of two shows that I record so that I don't have to view the commericals and can see it without interruption.  If you haven't seen this show, go out and buy the 1st Season, and I suspect the 2nd Season will  be released in the summer.  You will not be disappointed!!!
B004I744AS|5.0|I downloaded this to my Kindle Fire and I really enjoy it.  Besides giving you the meaning oof the you can also hear the word pronounced which is a great feature.  The opening page is great too as there is a &#34;word for the day&#34;, you can get the weather for your town as well as your horoscope.  Who could ask for more!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This game makes me feel like I'm in a movie! Great graphics, awesome storyline,  not to mention the challenging puzzles within the game. All I can say is I can't wait for part two.
B0093LINVK|5.0|I got this with Intel centrino 6235, 8GB DDR3 & 128GB mSATA.  Installed Win 7 64-bit (make sure you download the drivers from the website) with XBMC.  Bad boy boots in less than 20 seconds (right into XBMC).  I am extremely impressed with its performance.  I know it not a fair comparison but it run all over my boxee box.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Don't miss this one it is so well written and the character development is pristine they brought all of them to life so well.<br /><br />Loved it.
B006FO3ERQ|3.0|The premise of this story is good but this author spends way too much time describing in minute detail things that are not important to the story.  I am going to finish this book because I want to see how things turn out but I would never read this author again because alot of the pages I just skimmed through because of all the ridiculous detail.
B00B0ZT9NI|4.0|A good movie with suspense, political maneuverings, humor, and a great 70's vibe.  The movie had excitement without relying on big special effects.  Alan Arkin was amazing.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this game is so addictive I played it all day and night I was so tired. that's how fun it is but I slept all day you need to buy this game its awesome
B007REV4YI|5.0|I was one of many that questioned Craig as the choice for the new James Bond. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed every movie I had seen the man in and a few BBC television productions I had seen the man in. He is one of those rare actors that seems to have an innate ability to choose scripts well and a \\"loser\\" I have never seen the man in.<br />Well, the first Bond film came out with Craig as 007 and I was blown away. I immediately put Sean Connery into second place as my favorite Agent 007 actor replacing him with Daniel Craig. Besides Craig and Connery, the others were in my opinion dismal failures. What I really liked about Craigs Bond was the steely cruel edge he brought to the role. He also seemed to rid the character of his \\"effete\\" nature. Craig may still like his Martini shaken not stirred but one has the feeling that he wouldn't be hard pressed to take his Vodka not only neat but directly from the bottle.<br />The second Bond film was a bit of a let down and way too short. A definite step down from the initial Craig outing and I was worried that perhaps something was up behind the sceens that spelled an end to Daniel Craigs career playing agent 007. I was thrilled when the third installment featuring Craig came out and if any single scene sums up why I enjoy Daniel Craig as James Bond it was toward the beginning of the film, after Bond finally managed to make it inside the train car. Swinging down into the car and in one seamless motion, Craig \\"shot his cuffs\\" and continued his pursuit of his target.<br />Yes, this movie does end the great Mrs Dench playing the role of M but all doubts concerning Bond \\"losing a step\\" were completely laid to rest. He might have been slowed but the cause was injury related and one left the film feeling that no matter what age the secret agent attains, he will maintain his dominant edge by sure force of will if nothing else.<br />If there was any weakness in the movie it was in the failure to fully flesh out the villian played admirably by Javier Bardiem. I don't know if there was a great deal of his character left on the editors floor or what but a lot more could have been done with the character, especially when the talents of Mr. Bardiem were available.<br />Nothing about this film made it anything but a rousing success in my opinion. We will always have James Bond and I only hope that we continue to have him played by Mr. Craig for quite some time!rably by Javier Bardiem.

B006PTNQGU|5.0|Our kids are movie goers.  This was a bit of a chance on this oldie but they loved the action in it.  Good Guy bad guy with kids never looses.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This is probably the best book I have ever read. In fact, it may be the best book I will ever read, and I have been a college professor for over 20 years. There are very few books that make me feel the full spectrum of emotions like Les Miserables. From sheer joy to a profound sadness, this great work of literature has it all.
B00BESIKWM|2.0|This movie is a disgraced to the previous one. It took something that was brilliant (Silent Hill 2006) and made it something completely unimaginative, boring, 3-D (which was not necessary) and NOT scary.

0767821629|5.0|The Thirteenth Floor was Columbia Pictures answer to the Matrix and is based on the award winning 1964 Sci-Fi novel, Simulacron 3 by Daniel Galouye. I have known about this movie for a long time, but was always hesitant to see it, because when something like this appears in theaters 6 months after a groundbreaking film like the Matrix, you fully expect it to be a complete rip off. I was sitting at home flipping through the channels and saw the Matrix on, but I didn't wanna see it for the millionth time and decided to see if the Thirteenth Floor was streaming and sure it enough it was, and what a terrific story it turned out to be! In the year 2000, scientists have found a way to transfer a persons consciousness into a fully interactive computer program which has the potential to replace video games. The creator however has discovered a major problem with the system and is found dead. The second in charge of the project soon learns the answer to this brutal murder appears in the simulator, which is a replica of 1937. The story is absolutely ingenious and I loved how the film jumps between present day and the 1930s, it was like watching two stories at once that you knew would eventually come together. Craig Bierko stars in what turns out to be one of his few leading roles and he's just terrific. I remember him as the bad guy in the Long Kiss Goodnight and I thought he was great then, and he's great now. To make the cast even stronger, they take the intense Bierko and pair him with Law & Order's Vincent D'Onofrio, who is quite possibly the most intense actor in Hollywood. To top the whole thing off, this movie has a huge twist in the end, a twist that will make a lot of people wonder about the true nature of their own reality. The Thirteenth Floor is a fresh story with an amazing cast that will make you think, movies like this don't come along as often as they should!
B009YN2M7S|4.0|This was a good read. It was not too long but I did anticipate the antagonist's plans early on in the book. However it did have a twist to the plot and that was delightful at the end. I had no expectations except the romance. I do enjoy the anticipation of how the story would play out. The history and the story lines of the three main characters was good. I enjoy mysteries and this one had suspense to it.
B008JFUMT2|3.0|Die Hard was once a great series that featured a loveable charachter facing down the improbable, with great action, in a compelling story. But, the improbable has become the impossible in it's fifth installment, with over the top special effects, a weak storyline, and some very dry acting. I am an action junkie and Bruce Willis is one of my favorite actors, but the essence of John McClane died a long time ago. Right from the start I could tell that Willis wasn't all that into this and it shows, as McClan goes from being the ultimate tough guy to a man just going through the motions. The story centers around reuniting with his son in a foreign country, which I though was an interesting twist, but the angle as well as any semblance of a story was barely touched upon. Die Hard 5 was just one over the top action scene after another, with very little substance, emotion, or appeal for audiences. The John McClan we knew and loved, the man who saved the Nakatomi building, is long gone, instead he is replaced by an emotionless man who expects this sort of thing to happen to him wherever he goes. Willis was going through the motions for a big pay day, and while there were some good lines and some great action sequences, there isn't much of a story or cast to write about. Die Hard 5 is about making money through special effects, using characters who have long out lived their usefulness. If this is how the series has evolved than I pray that this will be the end of it. If the producers want to milk more money out of the franchise, maybe they can wait ten years or so and have some British hunk remake it, with Willis making a cameo, until then, I must declare the Die Hard series official dead with A Good Day To Die Hard.

B005RJ6DUK|5.0|For a long time, A Bronx Tale had distribution problems, was out of print, and was widely unavailable. For those reasons, I hadn't seen it since I was a kid. Watching it again years later, not only did I realize just how good a movie it is, but I also found that I took a lot more out of it. While being widely considered as one of the best mafia movies of all time, A Bronx Tale actually has a deeper meaning, which is not to waste the talent you have in the time you are given. I was also surprised to learn that this story is in fact the true story of Chazz Palminteri's childhood, with Chazz being a nickname for Calogero. For those of you who don't know the story, it's about the son of a bus driver, who grows up in the Bronx, right down the block from a mafia hangout. While this boy learns different things from his real family and his mafia family, who are always at odds, they actually both want the same things for this kid. A Bronx Tale isn't just another gangster movie, there is some of that, but it's really an inspirational coming of age tale that I found to be very eye opening. The cast is of course fantastic, featuring Robert De Niro, who directs and stars in the film, along with Palminteri, who wrote the film. The true irony of A Bronx Tale is surrounded by the true story of Lillo Brancato, the boy who plays Calogero. As I said the story is about discovering right from wrong and not wasting your talent, something Brancato did when he was convicted of an armed robbery, which led to the death of an off-duty police officer. There are many sides to that, but I felt it necessary to mention how ironic it is that the message of the film is actually lost on one it's stars. In closing, A Bronx Tale really is a lost gem, that lives up to all the hype, and I hope that now that's streaming on Netflix, a whole new generation will be exposed to the message it puts out there for them to hear.

B006S053K8|2.0|From the Director who brought us Paul and Superbad, comes Adventureland, which unfortunately is just another predictable, run of the mill comedy. Jesse Eisenberg stars as a kid whose forced to get a summer job at a local amusement park with a wacky cast of characters. Of course the only other normal one working there, just happens to be the girl that he falls for. Bill Hader plays the boss and he should be writing and starring in films like this instead of playing secondary characters. Hader is one of the funniest and most underrated comedians in Hollywood and I can honestly say that he is the only reason to watch this movie, because the rest of the cast is just dull and uninspired. Eisenberg gives another flat and emotionless performance, while co-star Kristen Stewart plays along as if she were still one of the undead. I generally like most of the cast and I thought the story was decent, but overall Adventureland is just another predictable lame duck comedy. It will give you a few laughs, but don't expect too much more.

B005SZAEYO|4.0|American Horror Story is one of the hottest shows on television, but it's origins may surprise you. This innovate, unique drama, has similarities to several different shows, but most closely resembles Tales From The Crypt. Unlike Tales, the American horror stories each last one season instead of one episode. From season to season the story changes as does much of the cast, but one thing remains constant, it has some of the smartest and most daring people behind it. You may know the creators Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk, as the guys who brought you Glee, but American Horror Story couldn't be more different. In this series they show a dark twisted side that they could never get away with on network television. As I said the story changes from season to season, so I can't really do a review of the series, but I can tell you about season one. The first season of American Horror Story introduces us to Los Angeles's famous murder house, which since it's creation, ninety years ago, has known nothing but death and heartache. The house is purchased by Dr. Ben Harmon, who knows nothing of the houses history. Dr. Harmon is moving his family across the country to give them a second chance after mistakes and personal tragedies. The story is gripping and easy to follow, but what I liked more were the flashbacks that told the history of the house and explain all the weird stuff that's happening. While the cast features some very experienced, award winning actors, it's a combination of Jessica Lange and Evan Peters who makes this show what it is. Lange is a veteran actress known more for her roles on the big screen, while Peters only just made an impression on me a couple of years ago in the film Clipping Adam. Their unique yet different styles and personalities are the reason this weird show works. In the same way they are able to connect with every character in the show, they are also able to connect with every member of the audience, and that's why they are two of the three castmembers who are back for the new story, Asylum. American Horror Story is not like any other show you've seen on television, in fact, I'm pretty surprised they are able to get away with some of the stuff they are doing. It's hard to find a good TV show based on the Horror genre and when you do it's usually a lame comedy. Shows like the Munsters and the Addams Family are legendary, while shows like Harsh Realm and Freaky Links just fizzled out. American Horror Story is different though, as it's innovative and pushes the limits of what you can do on television. It's a show that is most definitely not for everyone, but if you're a fan of the unusual and tired of things like Twilight and The Walking Dead, that go absolutely nowhere, check out American Horror Story, you should be pleasantly surprised.

B005FUTBV4|4.0|Kevin Smith's latest film does not feature Jay or Silent Bob, and it's most defiantly not what you're used to seeing from the acclaimed director. Smith not only directed and wrote this film, but he also produced it independently, keeping it out of theaters, but how come? The answer is simple, it's Smith's unique personality and ability to show a film in a context that is as real as possible. Red State is a fictional type story that resembles and mocks the events in Waco. Three High School kids, from a small town, decide to use the internet to find a prostitute. They think they found a bargain, but when they arrived they quickly discovered that all their lives are now in danger. The woman who placed the add, belongs to a religious cult, who owns a compound, where they execute sinners. Michael Parks plays the leader of this group, Abin Copper, and in ever sense of the word he is nothing but brillient! As the pastor with two personalities, a public and private persona, Parks is able to really give us an inside look at what is really going on inside the minds of these people, it really was a great performance. The other standout from this cast is John Goodman, who plays the lead FBI agent in charge, who has to battle his conscious at the same time he's battling Cooper. Red State is a dark and extremely graphic depiction of what life is like in an ultra religious, super conservative environment. Some of the graphic speeches and violence can be hard to watch, but the acting is off the charts good, and you can't ask for a more creative or innovative writer than Kevin Smith. As usual, this film isn't for everyone, but I really loved it.

B005S9ELVC|3.0|This film has received many bad reviews, but not because it's a bad movie. The truth is it's just not what people expected it to be. When you hear about a mafia movie, you expect an epic, inside look like with Goodfellas or Casino, but Gangster Squad is from the cops point of view and more like The Untouchables. Gangster Squad is based on a novel and is about an off the books LAPD operation aimed at bringing down Micky Cohen. In the 1940s, LA had a growing mafia problem on it's hands, and Mickey Cohen was set to become the next Al Capone. Unbeknownst for decades, the LAPD sent a group of cops, who didn't play by the book, after Cohen and by going after his business interests, they attempt to destroy his growing empire. The story is a great one, well deserving of a film adaptation, but what people didn't like was how it turned into an action film. This story has all the makings of an epic mafia drama, an you will be hard pressed to find a better performance than the one Sean Penn gives as Mickey Cohen. It was somewhat disappointing that they didn't get more into Cohen and his operation, but for what it was, it was a great film. As for the cast, it features some of Hollywood's best an brightest as old school meets the up and coming stars of the big screen. Every one from the stars to the ancillary characters give Oscar worthy performances that will be sadly overlooked. because of the nature of the film. If you're looking for a classic mob drama, you're going to be disappointed, but if you want to see an action packed cop movie with a mob element, then Gangster Squad is the film for you.

B005ZCXPP0|5.0|I'm sure the regular followers of my blog are shocked to see that I gave a superhero/comic book movie a perfect rating. It is a well known fact, that while I'm a Science Fiction fanatic, I hate superheroes and comics. I wanted to see Captain America though, because I'm fascinated by the Avengers. I really can't see how all those big stars are going to work together, so I wanted to see all the films leading up to the Avengers, so I could follow along. Tommy Lee Jones, one of my favorite actors of all time, is one of the stars of this film, and I know he won't sign on to do just anything, so I knew that Captain America would at the very least be watchable. The more and more I got into Captain America, the most surprised I was by it's realism and honesty, it's not just the story of another superhero and how he's going to fit into the Avengers, it's the story of a very likeable character who wants to be something more than he is. I also loved the fact that this film took place in the 1940's as opposed to the modern era, because it gave a uniqueness to the story. I didn't feel like I was watching another Superman or Batman type of movie, I was really seeing something unique. The cast was fantastic, Chris Evans in particular, I don't know where the people who do the casting for these movies keep finding these guys, but each newcomer is better than the last. Captain America is unique and doesn't feel like a superhero out of some comic book. Comics are often based in extreme fantasy and appeal to those who want to escape their reality. Captain America was different though as he choses not to runaway, but to continually better himself, making him a uniquely remarkable character and it's those qualities that helped make a unique and remarkable film.

B008220D5K|3.0|Pete and Debbie, the loveable couple from Knocked Up, are back in the \\"sort of sequel\\" This Is 40. The couple are both turning 40, within days of each other, and decide that the number means it's time for a change, for them, as well as their family. They get new jobs and reconnect with family on their journey toward becoming a more mature couple, but it comes at a cost. Judd Apatow writes and directs this unique comedy, so I was expecting another hilarious winner, but they can't all be winners. The cast is fantastic and there are more than a few good laughs here, but this movie is extremely long and drawn out for a romantic comedy, and while it starts out strong, it starts to grow tiresome. There are many scenes between husband and wife that are boring and completely unnecessary. What I did like was how Apatow cast his daughters to be Pete and Debbie's daughters. They really are sisters and there was no pressure working for their dad, allowing them to really make it seem like this is a real family, and it's a good thing too, because for as good as both Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann are, they just didn't have much chemistry together. Both cast members were good in portraying their own characters, but when you put them together you see that something just isn't right about the pairing. I loved the concept and you will definitely laugh during this film, but it does lack a certain chemistry and is far too long for what it is.

B004SKLD9A|2.0|Equilibrium is an underground Sci-Fi film with a huge cult following. If you ask any other Sci-Fi geek, they'll probably have Equilibrium in their top ten list, but I couldn't tell you why. The film is vintage Sci-Fi, with a semi-original idea, unfortunately, the cast just didn't pull it off. I've never been a huge Christian Bale fan and this movie is a prime example of why. He's given a role that suites him perfectly and he mumbles and relies on the rest of the cast to carry him. In the future, emotions and things that evoke emotions are outlawed, and Bale is one of the men responsible for enforcing these laws, but he soon turns to the other side, when he accidentally feels an emotion for the first time. Bale is a cold guy to begin with. He never shows much emotion even when his role calls for it, so aside from Keanu Reeves, he was the best choice for this role. The story was a little out there and the effects were over the top, but it's Bale himself who puts the icing on the turd cake. He's completely dependent on his fellow cast members and the ridiculous special effects his character is given. Maybe I'm just not that bright, but I really don't understand why so many people are so obsessed with this movie. The cast wasn't anything special and the story was okay at best.

B005ILYW1E|4.0|Jason Statham has established himself as the premiere action star of generation X and he shows why in Blitz! Unlike many of Statham's films, this one isn't just about shooting people, it's actually a great thriller, about a serial killer in London, who is targeting the police. That being said, straight action films are supposed to be exciting and fast paced, but when it's more of a thriller, it needs to slow down a bit. I was impressed by Blitz, but I honestly felt like I was watching the film in fast forward. Statham's character is also a bit of a change from what his fans will be used to. Brant is a crude, tough cop, who doesn't follow any rules and is actually quite funny. I honestly never saw Statham as someone who could pull off a role that involved humor, but he was amazing in this movie. His performance as well as that of \\"the killers\\" really enhanced this film. I'm most definitely an action junkie and I've seen quite a few Jason Statham films, and I can honestly say that this is the best one I've seen. The action scenes are intense, the story is intriguing, and Statham's character is the kind of cop that audiences will fall in love with. Action is a very repetitive genre and it's truly refreshing when you find an action film with a big star and great story attached to it.
B00BJK4SE4|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy watching \\"Elementary\\" -- it is a superbly entertaining, updated version of Sherlock Holmes. The acting is first rate, as are the mysteries. There is always the concern with predictably, but that has not yet befallen this show. And I believe the chemistry between Miller's Holmes and Liu's Watson is very appropriate --- since it isn't supposed to devolve into some sort of physical affair. They are reluctant, yet true friends, and this update's FEMALE Watson is a refreshing contribution to the long history of portrayals of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson.<br /><br />I must admit, it is difficult NOT to watch this show ... And I like the surprising, yet plausible journey that occurs in every episode. Miller plays Holmes in a very engaging way -- complete with all of the idiosyncrasies a fan of the character can appreciate. And Liu's Watson is just as engaging -- and plays an excellent foil for Holmes, as any fan of the character would expect. It is always a gamble when writers (and actors) try to update or contemporize iconic characters ... this time, they all got it right! I've watched each episode and am impressed every time!
B006P0FD4W|3.0|Paranormal Activity started the phenomenon of films that are shot on camcorder. At the time, it was considered to be revolutionary, but at this point it's getting a little old. How many of these camcorder films have actually been successful? ...and don't you get just the slightest bit nauseated by the constant movement of the camera? I guess that's for you to decide, back to the film. In the third installment of Paranormal Activity, we learn what happened to Katie and her sister when they were little. To be honest with you, I was pretty into this film until the last twenty minutes or so. Without spoiling it for ya, lets just say the story takes a dramatic turn away from the storyline. The result of this is that the overall story isn't as creepy and really doesn't make as much sense as it should. Paranormal Activity was never that scary to begin with, the film plays on the audience by having things suddenly jump out at them, but the story itself has gotten far less creepier as the series has gone on. Part 3 and 4 do have different writer/directors and that may be part of the problem. The first one freaked me out, the second one was a little slow, but also did the trick, and this one really didn't scare me. They relied much more on making the audience jump than they did on scaring them with the actual story. Number three didn't stick with me for days afterward, the way one and two did. As for the cast, they were all newcomers and the little girls were absolutely terrific! This series has a way of finding newcomers who seem like they've been acting for decades. Paranormal Activity 3 is good for a few cheap jumps and laughs, but the ending was really disappointing, leading me to think less of this film than I do of the other two.

B00A9X9TIW|4.0|You can never go wrong in choosing a movie that stars Bruce Willis or Joseph Gordon-Levitt, but when they come together, that's when the magic really happens! Looper is the brainchild of Rian Johnson, who likes to bring us unusual stories, that mainly star JGL, however Looper is much easier to follow than most of Johnson's other films. While I'm not his biggest fan, his attention to detail has always really stood out to me and is perhaps never more evident than in Looper. Johnson actually used make-up and special effects to make JGL resemble a young Bruce Willis, which I found to be ingenious. Not to be overlooked is of course how clever a story Looper is, as it blends together time travel and the mafia. In the future, time travel has been invented, but like every other good thing, it is illegal. The mafia controls time travel and uses it as a weapon to commit murder. In this future world, it is impossible to dispose of a body, so the mafia sends their targets back in time where they are met an executed by a hired gun, known as a looper. The performances are of course top notch, Willis, the action star of a generation, only gets better with age, and JGL is the simply put the hardest working, most under appreciated actor in all of Hollywood. To be completely honest, this intriguing, action-packed, thriller was not as good as I expected it to be, and I really didn't care for the way in ended. That being said, it is still a great film that is definitely worth your while.

B006RED4GA|2.0|I was looking for a good horror movie, that fell under the radar, to promote for halloween, and I was told that the Innkeepers was that film, but it wasn't. This film is so clique, stealing almost everything from other films of the same genre. They had the nerve to give this movie an R rating and call it the must see horror movie of the year, but truthfully, its slightly more scary than a Disney movie! An old hotel is going out of business and the two remaining employees decide to investigate the long history of ghost sightings at the establishment. There are only a couple guests, giving them the perfect opportunity to investigate. The only thing this film uses in order to frighten you is random things jumping out at you, which most of the time aren't what you expect them to be. There is also a creepy old woman staying there who can talk to the spirits and predict the future, but if that isn't bad enough, there is of course the investigations themselves. Using nothing but a s***ty old tape recorder, they go looking for EVPs, using every phrase and question they could steal from Ghost Hunters. Yeah, the Innkeepers really is that ridiculous and the only really shocking thing about this movie is that someone actually gave it an R rating! Was the MPAA associate a little girl or elderly woman, because honestly, Monster House was scarier than this thing was.

He freely uses terms like engineered along with technical jargon that I doubt he understand completely to describe his passion. A little hypocritical to write a book bashing people who are scholars only to have a passion for automobile technology, don't you think? To bash people for not understanding every single detail and saying that studies using an electron microscope will get us nowhere when you have a love for objects created by intense research in materials science? Where does he think technology comes from? A little materialistic, too, no?<br /><br />Second, it's bizarre to me that he bashes science for having technical terminology and \\"Abstract Philosophers\\" for \\"...coming up with meaningless answers,\\" when his solution is to \\"recognize Inner Nature\\" and work with \\"Things as They Are\\". Talk about painting with broad brushstrokes. It reminds me of Deepak Chopra saying, \\"Consciousness is a superposition of states.\\" I know what each of those words is supposed to mean, but together it's a bunch of gobblety-gook. Hoff is essentially saying: ignore people who use technical terms and abstract ideas to pass as knowledgeable, what you need to do is find your Inner Nature, that'll do it. What?<br /><br />Lastly, he criticizes book-based learning quite often, emphasizing direct experience. Yet, his entire life is based on writing and photography. Why would you partake in industries that are the antithesis of direct experience? Hemakes money off of books and photographs, yet openly says that it'd be better to learn from experience directly. Seems like a sellout. Does Taoism say anything about selling out?<br /><br />To take a page from Holden Caufield, I think this man is a phony, a big fat phony. I can understand having a different point of view - if the guy lived like a hermit or some such, then that's respectable. If he were a hermit, I'd say: He walks the talk. This man doesn't. He bashes things that he deliberately uses, enjoys, and profits from consistently throughout The Tao of Pooh. Would you listen to a preacher who doesn't pray? If not, I probably wouldn't take too much of what's in these pages seriously.

0988262592|5.0|I usually don't read or submit 5-star reviews because they tend to be over-the-top and unrealistically positive about the product.<br /><br />However, this is one book that I feel fully confident in writing a 5-star review for.  Despite studying six sigma and lean principles in business school, I never studied a great example of applying those principles to an IT setting...Enter \\"The Phoenix Project\\"<br /><br />Instead of using a dry, theoretical textbook approach, Gene, Kevin, and George present an entertaining, yet realistic, narrative that explores how to apply lean principles to improve IT Delivery.<br /><br />This book should be required reading for anyone in the IT Operations field...it should also be read by any business leaders who do not have a firm grasp of the true value of IT to establish their company's competitive advantage.
1442357622|1.0|It was repulsive, and I quit reading it because the Author must have been smoking dope and dropping acid when he conceived it.
0061122416|3.0|THE ALCHEMIST is a fine allegory, which the author endows with mysticism and magical realism,<br />sometimes to the exclusion of credible plot development, though the very purpose of magical realism<br />is to escape from any realistic plot development.<br /><br />It works well as a &#34;Bildungsroman&#34; (a young person's coming-of-age narrative)<br />but the examples the author offers for following one's &#34;Personal Legacy&#34; and<br />how that becomes interchangeable with the &#34;Soul of the World&#34; are pretty<br />sketchy.<br /><br />Basically THE ALCHEMIST is an appealing revisiting of some of the themes in PILGRIM'S<br />PROGRESS.--Ultimately the young protagonist finds his own &#34;Celestial City&#34;<br />through faith in his Personal Legacy and its identity with the Soul of the World.<br /><br />The novel's reductive tone simplifies the complexities of life's conundrums in a way<br />that is reminiscent of a homily--a conventional format expressing aspirational intent through<br />proverb and fable.<br />Many readers who are not offended by middle-brow cheer will find this novel heartening and<br />uplifting.
B008AX1HD8|5.0|Read his first book last and convinced he kept the same standard throughout all his books. Edge of the seat!

0451450523|3.0|The world of fantasy literature has exploded and perhaps some of the classics of an earlier time are not holding up as well as we wish they would.  I found the book to be a little simple and maybe even boring.  But then again, it may just be me.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Reading this series on my son's recommendation after many years away from fantasy books, and it's wonderful if also very dark. The characters are richly portrayed - many of the evil players have redeeming features and depth, they are not simply forces of evil like Tolkien's Sauron. The mixture of medieval realism with magical elements like &#34;wights&#34; (zombies) is fun. Don't get too attached to any particular character because most of them will meet a violent and bloody end during the series! Highly recommended.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Doesn't take a lot of time to play which is nice. Fun to play if you've always wanted a horse!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This DVD was a perfect addition to my other sets.  The quality was great and was a nice addition to this series.

B000FCKGPC|5.0|A lot of people have dissed this book as too different from the others with a lot of extraneous characters and nothing about the Starks, but I found it just as good of a read as the first 3, just with new characters!  If you like his writing style, I don't see why you wouldn't like this.  Still just can't wait to find out who wins!  (Although I have a good idea!)
B009O2XY12|5.0|My personal favorite. I even love it more than my child!  Challenging and keeps your attention.  Would highly recommend this

B004SJ3AXI|1.0|Large flashing ad at the top of the screen, tried to play this game but an ad popped up and covered the screen. Crappy :(
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Just look at the headlines in your local paper today.  They are talking about China stealing our secrect through Cyberterriorism.  How real can it be.  Tom Clancy continues to understand the world of Intelligence and he always has cutting edge information in his novels.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|(Minor spoiler alerts ahead) The first half of the movie was absolutely top notch. The pacing was well balanced given the multitude of characters and the plot evolved nicely (although you really had to recall the first two movies for it all to fit together). The acting was fantastic for the most part and I was blown away by Hathaway's Catwoman in particular. (Anyone who says Hathaway's acting here is terrible is saying that based purely on not liking Anne Hathaway.) But at the point Bane takes control of Gotham, the movie REALLY drags. Instead of focusing on Bruce Wayne in prison, the focus is on the siege. Sadly, it's also at this point in the movie that Bane becomes uninteresting. So, 30 minutes could have been cut out of the movie here. During the siege we also see more of a focus on 'Robin' whose backstory is so reinvented, it's not even Robin anymore. As much as I like Joseph Gordon-Levitt, his role in this movie wasn't necessary especially when you consider there isn't going to be another Nolan Batman movie. I also didn't like the twist involving Raz Al Ghaul's descendent which felt like a last-minute, desperate attempt to surprise the audience. Bane should have been the sole agent of vengeance, as he was in the comics. Finally, how the HECK did Batman fly the bomb more than 6 miles out of the city in less than a minute? Sigh, flashes of the 1966 Batman movie. Like The Dark Knight before it, TDKR suffers from trying to do too much. At least Cillian Murphy's Scarecrow had a good cameo. And I'm still blown away by Catwoman.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Mitch is a great Character.  I have followed his exploits from the beginning.  I like the way he is a no nonense sort of guy
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Too much nudity/sexual content for my liking but overall well done. Encapsulation of one man's fight against himself to find himself...
B0071XO8RA|5.0|When I first read Wool, it had been ages since I had truly devoured a book, that a book captured my attention so thoroughly that I couldn't put it down until I had completed it.  Wool was the first book I read using my new smartphone and its Kindle app, and while my eyes may not have been thanking me at the end, I just kept wanting more of the series. Hugh Howey has this magical ability to create such fascinating stories and mysteries that pulls the reader along (and if you know anything about the guy, he's probably one of the most friendly authors out there and really dedicated to his fan base), and I would highly recommend to every lover of science fiction to read his books...or anyone who loves to read! Be prepared to purchase his other Silo books after finishing the Omnibus though, you won't want to stop!
B003E8P9G0|5.0|This book is the best  book l  read. It has a lot  of action.<br />Buy this awesome and action pack book now.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use.  I definitely recommend this calculator. Great for simple calculations.<br />the numbers are a nice size the touch pad is pretty accurate.

B00821OX98|5.0|Great show that has all of the elements... action, love, comedy... the list goes on. I enjoy this show with my son.
1451695195|3.0|First, I was annoyed by the lists of facts(names of schools he and his family went, various towns, neighbor's full name, his doctors' full names, etc) he tried to throw to the readers in the beginning of the book as if he is trying too hard to prove something.<br />Secondly, I will believe his story if he donates all the proceed from this book to a charity.<br />Otherwise, to me, the book was phony plus, I don't really believe anyone who names his kid Eben IV after his name, also it reminds me of Ebola virus.<br />If the dream happens really fast, could it be possible that it happened right before he woke up from his coma?
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe Haven grabs your attention from the first word and keeps you intent until the last.  Easy read. Now i can see the movie.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|I liked this book<br />.  But it made me sad<br />  I would recommend it though good reading.  Very easy reading
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a great book, can't wait to see the movie.  Nicholas Sparks Rocks!!  Good story line and easy read.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|This is an incredible item and it was shipped very timely.  I enjoy this CD and have listened to it numerous times.
B001NEXEEG|5.0|Like a true antique is more than 100 years old, a true classic has stood the test of time and still remains something especially fine.  I am watching this film (for the umpteenth time) as a requirement for  a graduate class in American history on the Western as representing an important aspect of American culture.  I think the professor made a wise choice.  The characters represent icons in our perception of the American West, but they are artfully and realistic representations of bigger than life mythological figures.  And there are no movie stars like old movie stars - John Wayne and Jimmy Stuart do not have stars today who can fill those boots.
B000RZIGVS|1.0|When I received Next Gen full set, it was packed losely and was thrown around during shipment.  Attempted several times to watch series, to find 3 to 5 episodes not playing and a whole disc with 4 episodes was a disc from a different series in another language? HELP  The reason it is son late in hearing from me that I bought the set watch over the holidays, but my mother took very ill and died in Mar 2012.  No real time to get back with you,  the other series DVDs arrived with Next generation in fine condition.  Also, it states that there is a poster that comes with it.  When received it looked like repackaging and reselling trash.  Please handle this company that shipped that Set, disappointed is an understatment.  Thank you Cecilia
B008JFUTUY|5.0|AMAZING! A diamond in the ruff... great flick...Sixto Rodriguez is quite a treasure... hope he gets his well deserved recognition... I'm a huge Bob Dylan fan and I tell you this guy is also an amazing songwriter as well...
B00APJLFEG|5.0|This is one of the best family movies I've watched with my kids in a long time. The characters are great and some of the scenes are so funny; I laughed so hard my sides hurt. I highly recommend this movie to anyone young or old; if you love the horror genre and love a good laugh this one's for you.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I was hooked after the first episode. The entire set is so authentic and being able to see the intricate interactions of the rich with household servants in true life like situations is captivating. I was a skeptic at first but was i was drawn in to the human drama surrounding this family I was hooked.
B004LWZWGK|3.0|A good followup to the prior release, but Bane is no where near what Ledger's Joker brought to the screen.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I use this app all the time. Well worth it. Highly recommended.why isn't it set up on kindle as standard i wonder.
B000X4GXT0|5.0|Great Director, leading wonderful actors backed up with spine tingling music.  From their meeting to their deaths Romeo and Juliet are brought to life in this breathtaking film.
B001TKD4ZI|5.0|I love Ms. sparks Vamp series and How to Marry was a fun lite fare.  The romance was sweet and vamp juicy.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book keep me involved and I didn't want to put it down.  Just as I thought the story line went one way it would change.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|not as a good as the 1st season, but still so entertaining! was excited for season 3! maggie smith is a gem.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I plowed through the first book of the trilogy because of the historical value. However, I can't put this second book of the trilogy down! Has the same historical value, but is on a more personal level. You begin to really love the characters and want not only to see what was happening during the two world war periods but also to see what was happening to the characters as their lives are intertwined!
B002SSUQFG|5.0|I have now find a watcher my husband will wear. He love it. My grandson want one for his Christmas present. Now i know i be looking for one him too.
B003ZHQVJO|4.0|Love the CD however when I received it the case was all cracked:( they need too do a better job packing CD's before they ship them out... Other then that I'm happy with it.
B002W5GPVE|5.0|I got this to help me in my uni study. A lot of the research is a big help to me
B0063GORYU|5.0|Love Spider Solitaire--I've been playing for years, and it's still one of my favorites.  MobilityWare also makes Freecell, which is equally addicting.  Both are good for teens on up.  You won't be disappointed with either game!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is one of the best runner games I've ever played. it can get very difficult and that's how I like it. There aren't impossible obstacles like in temple run and 2 everything is possible. There is also much more stuff to buy in subway surfers and characters to choose from. You can purchase this game off of Amazon.com.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Great actors and acting, but hated the ending where Mathew gets killed. Also, dont think the writers should have hinted that Edith will start living in sin with her editor.
B002GHHHM4|5.0|Skip Fist of Fury and his others and buy Enter the Dragon. For one thing, it's not badly dubbed. It is almost like a James Bond movie. Lee travels to a mysterious island to fight in a martial arts tournament and bring the owner of the island to justice for various crimes. John Saxon plays an American who goes to the tournament for the money. This has Bruce Lee's most iconic moments like the room of mirrors and the tasting his own blood thing. This is one of the best action movies of the 70s so I highly recommend it.
B004SIP8OI|5.0|This move is great.  Good pictures quality on the blu ray.  Uma is great... and who can argue with a tarentino film?
B0000UJL96|5.0|In the same way the movie was made as the Cold War was ending so too was the original Enterprise Crew dealing with the end of the Klingon/Federation Cold War and coping with the fact that a new generation have to be entrusted with the present and the future. It is not just an action movie but also a mystery movie. My only real complaint is that I felt that the female Vulcan played by Kim Catrell should have been the Savik character from Star Trek 2 and 3. This would have made what happens more emotionally impactful. That complaint aside, I consider this to be the 2nd best Star Trek film behind #2 which is very high praise.
0812452240|5.0|I had this book and read it years ago but lost the book somehow. Since I wanted to read it again I purchased this copy. I was expecting t much bigger hardcover book like I had years ago but this one is much smaller. Good thing I have reading glasses. The book contains parts that were cut out of the movie which make it much better.
B0001US62I|4.0|This movie was extremely fascinating. Micky Rourke plays a private-i in the 1950s given a job by a creepy Robert DeNiro to track down a former singer who disappeared over a debt owed. Rourke ends up in Louisiana to track this man down and uncovers a web of deceit, murder and voodoo. I don't want to spoil anything but it is very well written and unique. Fans of horror and/or mysteries should pick this up.
B002ZG99A4|5.0|I bough the second movie  before geting the first by mistake, then I decided not to see the second movie until getting the first one. Woooooohhhh What a movie! This movie is better than the second, but don't missunderstand me, both movies are excellente!
B006Z7Z3S6|2.0|I was pretty underwhelmed by this one. It is the same director who did House of the Devil which is one of the best horror movies of the last decade. This movie is set in a hotel set to be shut down which is supposed to be haunted. The two remaining employees spend their last quiet weekend trying to find evidence that there is a ghost. That's about it. There are some creepy scenes but I feel this could have been a TV movie just the same.
B00792EGES|5.0|I love Alterbridge as band. They sound great in this second concert, but I like more the performance of the first one. Excellent image quality. A must to have for AlterBridge fans! Now I want another eith the AB3 songs included :D
B00687PWQG|4.0|There are 4 people responsible for pushing the US into independence: Washington, Franklin, Lord North and most importantly George III. John Adams is not among the essential people. Adams didn't &#34;out-argue&#34; anyone and convince them but rather King George and Lord North suspended the rights of Englishmen which were won in the English Civil War. Once they did that, a declaration of independence was inevitable. The war was won because Washington fought it and Franklin turned it into a world war. Adams had very little role. I think he was chosen because of his extensive writings to draw from and the fact he didn't own slaves as if audiences are too stupid to compartmentalize that aspect of an 18th century figure. Paul Giamatti is an amazing actor and really encompasses the role. The mannerisms and the formal ways of speaking are really shown. However, Adams's traditionalist Christianity is very much downplayed here. It has become a standard to overemphasize Jefferson's deism in his younger days and downplay the  fact that most of the founders were traditional Christians. One complaint with the filming style is that there way too many Dutch angles; this is a very hacky technique for a filmmaker to rely upon in order to make something dramatic.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Purchased the Blu Ray version, all I can say is wow! As most know the show is amazing, watching in Blu Ray quality is just jaw dropping.
B007REV4YI|5.0|This movie has received high praise and justifiably so. I would rank it up there with Goldfinger, From Russia with Love, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Spy Who Loved Me, Living Daylights, and Casino Royale. That is high praise for a series that is now 50 years old. Craig plays an aging Bond perfectly. Javier Bardem plays a very memorable Bond villain with a real ax to grind against M. We get a glimpse into Bond's past which might be the first time we've seen this in 23 movies. My one concern is that Craig is starting to look a little haggard from age (though no fault of his own) so I really wonder how many more movies he's going to be in. Also I hope that then next Bond film is more traditional in the sense that he gets an assignment and does it as opposed to going rogue or seeing big personal revelations- you can only do that once in a while. Definitely pick up Casino Royale and Skyfall.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I found this game to be quite interesting.  Once you learn how to play it, it becomes fun.  However, it is not free and that is very disappointing.  You should not give consumers mis-information.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|What a wonderful book!!!  Being a dog lover I decided to give this book a shot after reading the reviews.  I was instantly captivated and in love with this story, with Enzo and with his unconditional love.  This is such a beautiful story with so much heart and emotion.  One of those few that I know I won't soon forget.  Have recommended it to everyone as the one book that must be read!

1594487154|5.0|Once again, Dan Pink delivers. In To Sell Is Human, he taps convincing psychological studies that reinforce his ideas about selling and validate the fact that selling today is very different from the approach your parents may have taken. Before the democratization of information made possible by the Internet, sellers held the cards. Based on the availability of product information, quality and pricing comparisons, customer reviews, etc., the fulcrum has shifted and, in many selling situations, it's customers who now have the advantage. This book is loaded with insights and ideas that will make you a more effective salesperson, whether you're selling pharmaceuticals to a physician or an 8 o'clock bedtime to a 4th grader.

B00B0NDF26|5.0|Tbh I only purchased this album because I got a $5 mp3 thing from Amazon. And then I was looking through the albums on here and I spotted this Tegan and Sara one out for like 9 bucks. I didn't even know they had a new album. I didn't hesitate to buy it. I've had all their other songs on repeat and I knew these wouldn't be any different. And I wasn't wrong about that. This album is so freaking amazing. It still has that T & S ness you grew to love but they obviously changed things up a bit because they're growing as musicians. So I would most definitely recommend this album to anyone who loves great music.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The book itself was poorly written, but managed to keep me reading till the end.<br /><br />Felt no uncontrollable urge to rush and download the next book.  Maybe if I get bored down the road.<br /><br />Overall read it if you'd like to see what all the hype is about and prepare to be underwhelmed.
B003XVYLDU|3.0|This was a truly interesting book. I enjoyed reading it and it made me look at things differently. A very interesting book
B007SGM084|5.0|I chose this book out of curiosity. Once I started reading it I got more and more interested. The more I read the deeper I was hooked. I could not put it down.  I would highly recommend reading the whole trilogy.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Bought it for my friend because she LOVES Christian Bale and of course, BATMAN. Very Simple came in on time and in condition described. Thanks!
B000NTPDSW|5.0|The Blu-ray version of The Godfather Collection is amazing. If you are expecting crystal clarity like a new movie, you won't be impressed. However, if you've seen The Godfather through the years from VHS to DVD and then on Blu-ray..... you will be impressed. The colors are much more vivid and the film itself is much more clear than any previous versions of the film. Its like watching a whole new movie, Seriously. The extras disc is awesome too. Because finally you get most, if not all, of the extra footage that was in The Godfather Saga. I highly recommend The Godfather Collection on Blu-Ray.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this series, though I understand it was meant for teens.<br />I haven't taken the time to read for enjoyment (read \\"escape\\") since the marines.<br />I think this series was a good reintroduction. Fast, easy to read, enjoyable. I liked the author's first person narrative; really allowed me to get into Katniss' head, therefore relate to the feelings and moods portrayed.<br /><br />I look forward to the movies to join, though, ultimately I know I'll be disappointed compared to the books lol.<br /><br />Anyhow, now that my mind is being awakened, time for bigger things...
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I enjoyed this book SO MUCH!!!!! I would encourage anyone looking for a suspenseful love story to definitely purchase this one....it is awesome!
B0088P2A7A|5.0|This app makes it so much easier to find information on something. I hate having to go on the internet on my tablet, because there is sometimes lag. This app is really good.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|OMG, I can't even describe how much I love this book.....it is definitely the best book I have read in a LONG LONG time....I cried, I laughed, I was in shock....and I couldn't stand to put it down.....After finishing the book, I even had to email the author to tell her THANK YOU for writing a GREAT story,......did I mention this book is AWESOME?!?!?!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game. Temple Run was good, but this is so much better. I like the gems and the new special abilities.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|It was well written and was very interesting . It showed that people who have been betrayed can find true love
B009FZFONO|5.0|This was a great episode and I'm glade that amazon has them up on the website so quickly, 5 stars from me. Thanks amazon!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|recomend to all, a great family movie and I would even recomend to all my church family. aa  aa  aa
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Yes, my title is lame, but that's how I feel. Why did I wait for years to read this book? [banging head now] It took the HBO show to push me to reading this, and once I did, OMG I could put it down. There is so much in these books. I don't know how you'd give it a genre, because anyone would these books. There should be a George RR Martin shrine ....
B008CPZNL6|5.0|I iniatialy got Flipboard on my Galaxy S III android phone and couldn't stop reading it. A really cool media app that I recommend and tell all my friends about.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|I just didn't find this book appealing or interesting or sexy.... I've known toddlers who deal with issues better. Now, it could be me... all books aren't for everyone and I understand that. I just thought this would have a little more punch, a little more reason for me to care. Obviously I must be in the minority as this has a lot of good reviews. I just don't think it is up to par with books it is grouped in with.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It was a very good book. I couldn't put it down. Now I want to go see the movie. Good family values.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Really good book and hard to put down. Some points are a little perdictable but thats how it goes with Nicholas Sparks. Overall readablity though is great, gets you sucked in and makes you cry.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|More zingers from the Grand Lady, and although I didn't like this season as much as the first, it is a necessary tie-in to season 3.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Stunning conclusion to the hunger games series. You will not be dissappointed the the final chapter of this great series. I have re-read all three books multiple times and they are still exciting. There are so many details that are too easy to forget.
B00820N2JG|5.0|You have to watch this movie.....this movie was as funny as all hell for so many different reasons. I watched this movie with some friends and we laughed so hard we were crying at the the puppet sex scene.......Freakin hilarious.<br /><br />If you have the chance, you should buy the unrated version from Amazon (which is at a great price I might add)....the unrated puppet sex scene takes puppet sex to a whole another level........This movie is a MUST SEE........
B003O86FMW|5.0|A great follow up to the first book. Suzanne again leaves the readers hanging with every new chapter, thus you wont be able to put it down. Do not start reading this book until you have time to finish it.
0679847367|5.0|I got three of these for each child so that i can have their teachers sign them through the years and then give to them at HS Graduation!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is an amazing book. The way that Suzanne writes leaves every chapter hanging on edge. This is a book that you wont be able to put down.
0738212415|2.0|Bought this for my teenager thinking she would love it! She hates the book and doesn't even use it. I wasted my money. It had boring looking drawings in it and nothing she really wanted to draw. She won't even touch the book!!!
B000JMKNV0|5.0|This book will keep you guessing from beging to end. Even if you have seen the movie I highly suggest reading this book. This is a book that you wont easily forget.
B007EECSFA|5.0|It made me realize, once again, that you never really know another person completely. The characters were believable. The mystery was intriguing and the outcome satisfying. What a great read!
B000065K5S|5.0|This purchase is everything I had expected.  There is no need for me to spend time searching stores to find exactly what I want.
B001NLL8LA|4.0|Reacher learns about tough opponents and trained fighters. People younger and harsher than him. Can he handle the job? Who was that masked man?
B005ZUR724|4.0|A routine mmorg elevated by the novelty and convienience of running on android platform. Graphics are just ok but the expansive world and player community make for a fun diversion. Well worth the dollars.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|its ok but only gives you 15 minutes other then that if you buy the full version it is awsome
B00AI5AQPQ|5.0|I rated this book at 5 because I really like Matilda. I recommend this book because I think it is amazing .I would recommend this book because I would .
B003K1EYM6|4.0|I got this for a need and it fixes my problem. Only problem is that I wish the connection into the newer style connection would fit through cases. I have to pop the bottom of my mini iPad to connect it.
B00B7G3Y4U|3.0|I was really looking forward to this coming out, I was a bit disappointed with how the movie ran. Yes there are some edgy moments, but not like the others. Judge for yourself but be ready for suspense LET DOWN.
B004GYY714|5.0|Simply Best and i am listening Overseas Channel and this app is perfect for that. I am big fan of this
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|This site is very helpfully but slightly limited .As many things in this age,financial boundaries are set. I do believe that it seems to me that I have more accessible to me on the computer. I might be wrong due to fact that I'm new to computer use also.
0099579936|3.0|I liked the book. The plot was good. Keep in mind that this is the authors first book. She is very repetitive with the \\"sex scenes\\" though. I hate that the word \\"murmurs\\" is used so much, but again it is her first book. It's worth a read if you can get past the repetitive scenes. You really feel like you want to protect Anastasia Steele from Mr. Grey at first.
B004GYY714|5.0|Very beneficial,with a variety of choices and categories . Although limited on local up - to - the - moment  news ;but  I'm  New to this.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|Just plain rock. Not trying to be who they were in the past, although they end up sounding very much like it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is great it is not one of those rip-off games where someone else does everything. Also, I like that you have to earn your own things
B003YCI1O8|5.0|Purchased this in blu-ray to replace our original dvd.  Love the movie.  I'm a Kevin Bacon fan and enjoyed him, Reba McIntyre and the others in this movie.
0140143505|3.0|This book was ok. I would not read it again. It was just ordinary. I was glad to be done with it.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Stephen King made you feel like you were back in the 50's and 60's and you really did want to see history changed with the time machine. Another book that was hard to put down.
B008M721MS|1.0|I don't like it, the thing doesn't work, It is too hard to set up and doesn't work when it is configured, probably the most useless thing on the planet. It was indicated as being an &#34;app&#34;, what a nimrod description, some idiot can't spell application or program.
B000005JA8|1.0|Don't buy into the garbage that this is some masterpiece that you need to \\"understand,\\" that is \\"complex,\\" or that you just need time to absorb.  There is nothing here and just may be the worst album that I've ever heard in my life.  It is an album of absolute crap and nothing more. It sounds who has absolutely no singing ability, sings lyrics that a 5th grader who is trying to be silly and funny would write, while several other 5th graders with no musical training or competency bang around on their instruments.  It's not that I don't \\"get it.\\"  There's nothing to get and if anyone who claims to get it and enjoy it is only fooling themselves and others.
B008J34466|5.0|Pink's songwriting is superb with a voice to match.  She's incredible...this is the third CD that I've fallen in love with.
B0050SYS5A|2.0|I bought this because I'm using kinect in a small room.  It was able to recognize my movements, but the movements that involved moving forward and backward never registered.  Apparently I was told that zoom lacks depth perception.  DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM, unless you need an expensive kinect sensor protector.  If you cant get a good amount of space between you and the kinect, don't buy kinect.  The only way my sensor would work is turning my tv and removing the zoom
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Wasn't expecting a whole lot (a great way to go into a less-mainstream movie) but I like Karl Urban and Lena Heady is quickly becoming a geek-movie-and-TV goddess, was thoroughly entertained all the way through. Solid source material, treated with respect and executed really very well. One of the only movies I feel like the 3D version would be even more fun that standard.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|This app is a shortcut to the web browser on Kindle.  If is fully functional.  Lets me waste more time looking at kitten pictures.
B0091574VI|5.0|What a precious story this is. It shows lots of love among the chimpanzees. Photography is lovely. What a lucky chimp.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|This book kept me turning the pages, but I felt like I had to work a bit to keep everything straight. Grisham is a good writer, and this is just \\"good.\\" Not \\" very good\\" or \\"excellent.\\"
B00932ANQM|3.0|I'd say this is a family style movie as the love connection between the actors is kind of pure and sweet. The acting wasn't the greatest, but it was an OK story.
B005PK56TA|5.0|A co-worker recommended this series so when I had the opportunity to see it via prime i was eager.<br />If you like drama/horror and out of the box story lines (and this is a good thing) then definitely see this series
B004SBS8LA|4.0|This game is a good time waster, meaning, &#34;Time I need to fill while I'm going somewhere or waiting for something to finish.&#34; Very addicting as the levels become more challenging. Great while passing time on a plane.
0385360169|3.0|I really hate to give a best selling book a not-so-good review, considering the fact that I am no literary connoisseur, but I really couldn't see giving this book more than 3 stars (probably 2 if I weren't writing this review on a good day!).  One aspect that could have hindered my judgement is that I listened to this book on audio instead of reading a hard copy; the narrators voice sounded childish and a bit whiny. And the whole email correspondence got annoying (she read every date, time, to/from, subject).  However, I cannot put all of the blame on Ms. Battoe (narrator).  The first and foremost important thing I would like to suggest to the author is - Please spend some of your millions you earned from this book on a topnotch thesaurus!!  OMG...the eye rolls, the blushing, turning crimson, the breath hitching, the scowling, oh my - OH REALLY!!! The writing was juvenile and repetitious!  Oh and the sex scenes!...at first they were interesting and made me blush a little (especially with a elderly man next to me at the stop light...I know he couldn't hear what I was hearing, but it was still just a little embarrassing!)...anyway, back to the sex scenes - they became predictable and a little unrealistic...COME ON - three orgasms within 15-20 minutes...very rare, even at 21 and 27.  The audio book consisted of 16 CD's and halfway through I was ready to call it quits, but I hung in there until the end.  Several friends, who are fans, assured me that Darker and Freed are better, so I will bite the bullet and read them because I can see the love story forming between the two, but come on Mr. Grey take the BP out of your ass and lighten up!
B003THHIEM|5.0|The characters work well together and the plots are interesting. Would recommend to those who like detective shows. Very entertaining
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I found this to be a wonderful way to waste time. It was entertaining (and humorous) to see that you had a &#34;luke skywalker&#34; bird, a &#34;han solo&#34; bird, a &#34;chewbacca&#34; bird. All with very cute and specific functions.
B004H4XI5O|4.0|Thank goodness this wasn't a how to do it book.  At least not in its entirety.  The book is actually filled with what may be to the reader, little know facts about a group of people we know very little about.  How they do it, and what it has accomplished for some.  Yes, you will learn some techniques for improving memory, but even if you have no intention of using these techniques,  it reveals a lot of the magic behind the scenes.  An entertaining fast read as well.  Upbeat, and useful.
B004I744AS|1.0|The kindle already comes with a dictionary, so such a function is unneeded in my opinion. Unless you want to look up words that you see or hear from other sources...
B007HGPBRC|5.0|If you are at all a Hitchens fan, read this.  It's not a mind bender like some of his fantastic works can be, but the human being stands up well in this fast read.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|You will never go broke if you always bet that a corporation in our free market society will always be scheming up ways to cheat you out of more money in every so subtle ways. Making you pay for this camera is one of them.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong it is a very nice feature, I had some fun with it while me and my wife were on vacation.<br /><br />But it is still a shame that you have to pay for a feature that, frankly, should always be free.
B007PFD90G|2.0|All I can say, is that a book is a very personal experience, so I'm not going to complain about the writing skills of Rushdie.  For me,  Rushdie writing this book in the third person, just ruined it for me.  I believe I understand the experiment.  His life often reads like a Detective / Murder mystery novel, typically done in the third person.  But it's not a detective novel or murder mystery, it's autobiographical, and the third person reads ridiculous, when &#34;he&#34; should be &#34;I&#34; and that's that.  I kept wanting to put myself in Rushdie's place, as he unfolds his story, but that's pretty hard to do, when he is referring to himself as &#34;he&#34;.  Preposterous writing style for the venue.  I'm off to read the next book on my list, I'm actually sorry to say.  600+ pages of unreadable stuff for me.  Shame really.  I wanted to like this book very much.
B009GED3HS|5.0|The characters are rich and the writing is excellent.  The episodes are 22 minutes and it's great for a quick laugh without requiring too much of a time commitment.
B001LPWGE6|5.0|Excelente trilogia. Las 3 peliculas son muy buenas y el blu ray se ve excelente. Totalmente recomendable. Ideal para escuchar con un equipo 5.1
B009UX2YAC|5.0|honestly the most addicting game ever. It is all so super fun and kid friendly. Even though people compare it to temple run, I think there is a big difference.
B008BU70HW|5.0|I loved this book.  Gave a lot of insights to the show.  I learned a lot about the characters and filming of the show.  It had a lot of wonderful pictures.  Money well spent!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks is a great story teller. Loved this book. It has everything in it to keep you interested. From the first page to the last page you can't put it down, When its finished your sorry that it ended.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love Nicholas Sparks.  This book was very good. It had all the elements that you expect from Nicholas Sparks, charm, romance, love and in this case a lot of exitement.  I loved the unexpected elements of this book as well!  Well worth reading.
B00BF2UKDE|5.0|This is a brilliant record made by true masters of the form. It is thoughtful (12 months in the making), minimal, beautiful and powerful. It is much milder than anything they've recently done, yet it certainly fits in with the times. If you're a fan of recent recordings by The National or Bon Iver, you'll feel right at home here.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|the days have passed and Rio has not loaded! was really looking forward to playing this on Kindle Fire! does it take too much space? am I the only one it will not load on?
B005CRQ2DK|4.0|I love it,just like the rest of the series,I would definitely recommend this humorous,amusing,super fun novel.If you like funny fiction books then try this.Thanks
B0002BO05S|5.0|well done - depicts many detailed events in the life of The Master - great for teaching Bible Stories to your children and great for yourself when you need a good movie to think about good things and bring piece in your soul
B007FO5PYK|5.0|I had seen it when it first came out, so I knew what I was getting.<br />May be one of Pacino'e best. Such a smart movie. My two favorite parts are<br />1) racing the Lamborgini<br />2) defending Charlie at the disciplinary hearing.
B0006B7MS6|5.0|they just don't make movies like this anymore - great story - well done - great actors - you will love it
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I loved this season, except that I will miss the people that won't be back. I don't want to spoil it for anyone, so I can't say who it is. This is one of the best shows I have seen in a very long time.
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|you will love it - well done, great for a family gathering or a peaceful evening together... the acting is well done, the story is well done - you like jane eyre...you will love this one
B009AP2G26|4.0|My teenager like sot watch this show. I am not keen on the content of the show, but the singing is creative and well done.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|you will love it - well done, great for a family gathering or a peaceful evening together... the acting is well done, the story is well done - you like jane eyre...you will love this one FOR SURE
B0042TV4IW|4.0|Like the relationships and history of this show. Acting is pretty good too. The countryside scenes are beautiful. Love how they use characters of all ages!
B00007K02F|5.0|you will love it - well done, great for a family gathering or a peaceful evening together... the acting is well done, the story is well done - you like jane eyre...you will love this one
0062082353|5.0|After finally getting this book, no thanks to usps, but to Amazon for making it right thru fed ex,<br />I started this book. This man went to hell and back. In all his experiences, he was always professional<br />and loyal to his country and family. If there are any patriots still out there, this book is for you. Im only<br />halfway through it and its unstoppable. Well written and very sobering.<br />If there's ever been a time this nation is in danger from terrorism (within and overseas), Chris<br />spells it out perfectly with facts from being there on the ground. Highly recommend.
B003U80I5G|3.0|it is again ok for a family gathering or a peaceful evening together... the acting is ok, the story is ok - if you like jane eyre...you might want to add this to your collection
B009LT1YZ6|2.0|Artistic style is nice but the mechanics and difficulty turned me off.  If there was a better method of controll I would like it quite a bit more.  A simple tutorial would help.
B0001NBMEE|4.0|good entertainment for old fashioned evening at home with old friends or young teenagers to show them what clean movies should be like .... :-))
B002LANLDK|3.0|A little better than Tokyo Drift but not as good as the first two.  I didn't feel like there was as much to do with the cars in this one and it seemed like an awful amount of shooting and violence.  Not that I am opposed to movies with some violence and shooting but I just didn't expect so much in this series of movies.  It's worth watching if you liked the other Fast and Furious movies!
B00384RX8W|5.0|add it to your movie collection - it is long but very very very well done.... you can't miss on this one
B003R4ZMNQ|4.0|Great remake of a classic t.v. series.  Action packed with an episode to episode story line embedded.  Definitely worth watching  if you liked the original.
0767020308|1.0|no no no boring boring and again very boring - we all know the old story very well, but is not done well in this movie
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I loved this book. Even though I had part of it \\"figured out\\", there was plenty I didn't. Such an exhilarating book!
B00005JOA0|1.0|perhaps the actors are ok...the actress not well chosen and not well portrayed - very badly done ado not recommend at all...
1936608898|5.0|Today is my 25th birthday, and upon reflection, of all the things I am thankful for in the past year I am MOST thankful for Dallas and Melissa and It Starts With Food.  After years of chronic cardio, cutting calories, low fat, carb cycling, binges on sugary food, digestive issues, and general unhappiness I found this book on Amazon.  I decided on a whim to purchase it and tore through it within a week.<br /><br />This book has quite literally changed my life in countless ways.  What's even better is that it has helped me shape the lives and health of many of my friends and family!  There are a million reasons to buy this book and change your life so just bite the bullet.  Look forward to regaining your health and happiness (maybe after decades, like me)
B000784WMW|5.0|you love jane eyre you will love this one - very romantic and very well portrayed by all actors -
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|I've compared this mic with a Shure SM58 professional mic and with the embedded mic in my notebook and camera. The improvement is really good compared to an embedded microphone, but you might still need to do some noise reduction in your computer. If you look at some videos in youtube, you can do it with Audacity really quickly, but you have to do it.<br />The quality is good taking into account that it costs $17, but don't expect a perfect sound, it's not a professional mic.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Great, easy to listen to.  I enjoy the arrangements of the songs and love watching their videos, which makes a better connection to each song.  I would recommend this anyone who wants a different twist to popular songs.
B007XIC1GI|5.0|This book gives an interesting insight into the person behind the persona.<br /><br />Although I am not a huge fan, I have always been intrigued by MM. This provides a glimpse into why he is the way he is, and also how he became the star behind the face of &#34;evil&#34;.<br /><br />My personal view: A much misunderstood individual, who's talent is overlooked due to his persona.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|A great book that should be read every year by everyone.  I bought the Kindle edition and was very happy with it.  I keep it on my reader so I can go back and read different sections once in awhile.  A great introduction to Austin...
0321356683|5.0|It's really good book. I recommend it everyone who would like to improve Java skills, write effective appolications and  become an expert.
B00881VLCE|1.0|Had a hard time download the app, I gave up waiting for an hour to download the App. As well; in process down the app, there seems to be too much music  to this app. Repeat, I RETURN THE KINDLE FIRE.
B008M87GJK|5.0|Nowadays it is harder all the time to access true journalism (what with industry consolidations and extreme agenda)... BBC is an outlet that is stimulating, even compelling, but never shrill... and provides a view of the world that is not dominated by celebrityphilia.
B00ADYYY50|5.0|Wiz goes hard on this albulm as usual. Good quality and good features. definitately has some great keepers on here
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Great Job in bringing a very complex and massive story to the screen.  Keeps your attention throughout and you get really wrapped up in the characters.
B005PK553C|4.0|This series has great potiential, but at times misses the mark and the story lags. However, overall it's enjoyable and mysterious series.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|All I can say is where is the next season?  What a cliffhanger at the end and what a ride to get there!
B008220C38|2.0|This is a tough one to review  because the comments will, without doubt run the gamut. Going to the &#34;bonus&#34; feature first may  offer some perspective to Tom Stoppard's shrinking 600 pages of the novel to 130 of script, reducing the essence in 2-3 months as opposed to Tolstoy's 5 years and Sergei Solovyov's 10 years.  I disagree with his premise that Tolstoy began to fall in love with Anna, the crux of the novel. In Anna Popoff's THE WIVES which discusses the women behind some of  Russia's greatest authors, the idea of Anna was prompted by a neighborhood woman's suicide. The five years was to complete installments in THE RUSSIAN HERALD, beginning in 1876.There are veiled references to his own life and views...contraception, his own proposal to Sophia, and puerperal fever. A quote from Popoff's book, upon admiration from an acquaintance who admired the novel reveals Tolstoy's response as &#34;I assure you that this vile thing no longer exists for me&#34;. Of course it is known that Tolstoy shifted his views of family life, politics and religion.<br /><br />The director, Joe Wright, mentions the puppet theatre he grew up in and tried to create that atmosphere. I believe he succeeded in that sense with spectacular sets, costumes, and breathless transitions.If this film creates a curiosity in reading Tolstoy, that's an accomplishment in itself, although newbies may be disappointed by the traditional novel.

B00B5HQKNI|4.0|I was a big fan of the old Bond movies, but they had lost me in recent years.  This new movie has me back on board as a Bond fan again.  It's perhaps a little slow in parts, but It's a lot \\"edgier\\" than it's been in the recent past, and a lot more fun!  Daniel Craig is perfect in this role and I like the transitions they've made to prepare for a new generation of Bond support characters.
B003F5NSTW|5.0|When I read the last page of this book I just sat in a state of shock.  It is a shocking story, but it is brilliantly written.  Lionel Shriver is a master of her craft and the characters are so real you feel you know them, it one of those books which is very hard to put down.  I was totally engrossed from start to finish and felt I had lived the whole thing.  I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys good writing.
1592407889|5.0|Very rarely in my life do I start a book then cannot set it down.  My eyes hurt from reading this book from cover to cover.  What a life this daughter of Shirley MacLaine had.  She tries so hard to justify the absolute devastation she experienced from her parents but there is no justification.  Only realization of who they are as humans.  That fact she never let go.  If yoiu love Shirley MacLaine I would not read this - you will go down for a great disappointment.  Sometimes its hard for us fans to swallow the truth about people we don't know.  Side note that Shirley had no problem letting the world know Jack Lemmon was an alcoholic (in her last book) - I didn't know that - didn't really want to know.<br /><br />It was interesting to note how someone who claimed to be so spiritually aware - was conditional and detached most of the time to her own flesh and blood.  Very good story - again - I could not put it down.
B0000A2ZO1|5.0|I ordered this so long ago, now I do not have a VHS to watch it on...but I did enjoy it back then...
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Read once - going to see the movie then read it again :) absolutely loved this book almost as much as the notebook!!!
B002M3SP28|3.0|This book is much lighter in style than I had hoped, lacking the gravity of Mallory's accomplishments. It dwelled too much on Mallory's relationship with his wife - as guessed at by Archer. Historically, it was far from an accurate account. However, I rather hope Archer's proposition that Mallory made it to the top is someday proven accurate. We'll see...
B00005YUPO|1.0|My 11 month old daughter has been watching Baby Einstein, (although on a rather rare basis) since she was about five months old. She loved Baby Mozart, and I was pleased to discover that I could stand the video myself. Baby Bach? Creepy. Creepy, creepy, creepy. Clowns, weird music, and random chickens and children being paraded across  the screen. I'm just thankfully that I purchased this from a children's consignment shop for about $3.00. I would have been even more irritated if I had paid full price like many of the other dissatisfied customers who have reviewed this less than satisfactory video. Skip this one and get Baby Mozart or Baby Da Vinci. This one is just too weird for words.
B008QTVNUI|2.0|This show was recomended to me by a number of people, so I elected to download and watch it. I found it lacking in depth, entirely predictable and the acting generally weak.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Beautifully tragic. To simplify: \\"The definition of humanness is the opportunity to marvel at the majesty of creation.\\"  MUST READ
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|While it was an interesting season, I feel it lacked the intimacy and family of the 1st season. It didn't hold up for a whole season like the 1st. Too many elements and the story just didn't click with me the way the 1st season did. I only watched the 1st couple of episodes on TV. I watched the last 2 episodes on Amazon just to see the ending.<br />You know its not as good if you skip to the end. just like in a book. it didn't quite hold up in the middle. Look forward to Season 3.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is one of the best books my book club has read in years.  We had a worthwhile discussion because this book is so well-written.  The two main characters are fully developed. The secondary characters are developed to add a great deal to the book.  Even though the book was about terminally ill teenagers, it was not maudlin.  I highly recommend it to anyone who loves a well-crafted story.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Fast flowing narrative, wonderfully exciting and with a touch of humor! The author has a unique ability developing his characters to the point where you can actually visualize them as you read.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|A little difficult at times to read and follow along, esp. when names were omitted. Not quite as the musical or movie, more of a history or background story of the times.
B004LUHQ1G|4.0|I like about all the songs but White Limo.. haha, Taylor's an awesome drummer but i think watching dave drum and sing might of got to his head or something, idk.. lol,
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is very good and excellant and fun game to play. really nice games. give this game a good try.
B0006HBZXS|4.0|Do wish they would've been more realistic when it came to starting all those fires with a pack of like 10 wet matches haha.. But it was a good movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|:) love it so much but in survival where can you find diomands and I would love someone to join me I'm Logan.  BUUTTEERR
B0096PS4Y4|5.0|This album is so good it's not even funny. It's a mystery to me as to why more people don't know these guys. The pressing is also perfect. Absolutely no surface noise or anything. I honestly have zero criticisms of the product. I recommend this album in any format wholeheartedly.
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|It got here really fast and she was happy. happy with everything :) she and I really like the season
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I watched this movie about five time in 2 days.  then went and bought it.  would recommend this movie for a good laugh.
B0094K1MH2|5.0|Great story, great characters and just a truly fascinating movie.  I was hesitant to see it thinking that it would be a movie just for kids, but it sucks you in and before you know it you're rooting for the character.  It was constantly moving and never stagnant, the story just kept unfolding.  I will definitely watch it again.
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|story line is terrible and he should not play in any more Bond movies.  Never rent this movie or you will waste part of your life
1594481717|4.0|I stil found this a good quick read...or listen in my case.  I downloaded the audiobook and enjoyed it during my commute.  I would highly recommend this and some of Pink's other works as well as \\"Outliers\\".<br />This one was a little dated but the \\"mindset\\" was right on, it is interested to think about the world from this lens.
B00AB0AXU6|5.0|Wish the beginning wasn't as long before action began.  Wasted sometime playing the beginning in reverse then forward to start
1594484805|5.0|I definitely found this a good quick read...or listen in my case.  I downloaded the audiobook and enjoyed it during my commute.  I would highly recommend this and some of Pink's other works as well as \\"Outliers\\".
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I love the show but sometimes the show takes awhile to load and its not the internet or computer. I watch Netflix all the time and loading time is never more than a few seconds but with amazon instant tv, it doesnt always load and when it does, it takes a while. Other then that, I love it!
0316017930|5.0|I definitely found this a good quick read...or listen in my case.  I downloaded the audiobook and enjoyed it during my commute.  I would highly recommend this and some of Daniel Pink's works.<br />This fits very well with a lot of my entrepreneurial classes in determining what makes a good entrepreneur.
0307165485|5.0|A classic for sure! Thee stories and characters go way back, my little boy loves to look at the pics and there are all different lengths of stories so he can grow with this book and there is plenty of opportunity for him to learn and advance his vocabulary
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I bought this book because of the number of stars and reviews it got. I'm so glad too. It wasn't the normal adult fiction I normally read but it definitely dealt with adult subject matter. I couldn't put it down. I laughed and cried while reading this beautiful story of Hope. I hope you will too.
B0076DELIG|2.0|I don't do this very often, I stopped reading it 3/4 through.  It was just too predictable and got boring.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I thought this book was amazing! A very good read! I didn't want to put the tablet down when I was reading. I would highly recommend it to anyone.
B004QMRHHW|5.0|Fans of Amon Amarth's prior works should be very pleased with Surtur Rising. One pleasant surprise came with the tenth track - Doom Over Dead Man - which has a hidden instrumental track at the end leading into the bonus track of Aerials (cover of System of a Down). Using an MP3 cutter, I separated the instrumental so that it accompanies Aerials without listening through Doom Over Dead Man, first. Just a suggestion.<br /><br />I'll add that Amazon has made buying MP3's very, very easy.
B000ZP814M|5.0|i use at home every days when i have to stay working without sitting. this close are so nice and fix perfect
B003O86FMW|4.0|I was a little unsure when the book started but by the end I was very pleased with the book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is so fun I found hero brine 3 or 4 times in it zombies are cool so make a hole and put shad so it can live and not catch on fire  thanks.<br />For reading play add me on PS3 to :)
B00A8Q1N9S|1.0|The  description states that there is a game included. There is none. My child was very disapointed. We paid an extra 20 dollars for this one because it said it came with a game.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|&#34;The Night Circus&#34; is an amazing feat of imagination; fully engaging--out of words--all the senses. Really a hard thing to do. It is amazing how all the nuances and character developments keep winding together to form a fully realized story of complete originality. This is a tale screaming to have a film made out of it. The production designer and art department would have a field day putting together the artistry. Highly recommended for those who seek something different, something charming, something mysterious, and something rich with an Old World soul.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I know  a lot of these  awful things happened to the orphans in Ireland from reading about it, but to read this man's account of what happened to him as a child made my heart cry for him as I read his story.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The game is the best.I told my friends and they love it . I hope they make a minecraft 2.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|If your a fan of the new &#34;edgier&#34; 007 this is the best for Daniel Craig.  This is one that I will watch over & over again.
B009NPK1IO|5.0|I love gossip girl! I was so sad this was the last season but it's definitely worth watching and comes to a great end!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I am on vacation and could not put this book down.  The twists and turns were expected from the onset but not the insight into the work a marriage takes, makes or breaks!
B000NTPDSW|5.0|This may be the greatest American film ever made. The names have been changed to protect the guilty - but the archetypes remain. Every-bit a story about the great immigration of Europeans; thrown into the American melting pot and a resulting clash of cultures nobody utterly understood. Go to church on Sunday and kill you rivals on Monday. For many, the American way? This is a revealing look at human nature in all its gory glory.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Fantastic.....so glad to reconnect with the characters I love!  Can't wait for the next one, as I'm eager to read more!
B004X8W4A4|5.0|the book keeps  the reader in the loop and up dated on the story .can't wait to read the rest.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This book was a page turner from the beginning.  It was hard to put down once started. i know it's a cliche but the story was actually mesmerizing. The single person narrative explaining in detail the challenges the subject faced combined with his humorous bravado in the face of danger made you root for him throughout the book. Highly recommend this book to anyone who likes science fiction.
B005K17RU0|3.0|It's great for a preview, but wish it gave a little more information.  The paid version probably would give me what I want.
B00AHTYGRW|3.0|As usual, Hollywood can't seem to accept the fact that truth is greater than fiction.  If they had stuck to the facts it would have been a great story.  That plus the fact that they could have used a cardboard cutout of Ben Affleck though out most of the film and it wouldn't have been noticed.  What an expressionless display of acting.  3 stars because the rest of the cast did a fairly good job of being normal people in an abnormal situation.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|I really enjoyed the show. The characters are very interesting and funny. I have enjoyed watching this season 1 and looking forward to the next season 2. Mrs. Angelina Graziano
B008QE9XD2|4.0|I am sure this is a great movie, but it got eaten by the dog.  I am super excited that I also got the digital copy, so one day I plan to check it out that way.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love horses and this is a great horse lover game. it has a lot of in depth ways to take care of your horse.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Love it.  I am a fan of all the Marvel characters so I was thrilled when they made this movie.  It might not be for everyone - there are moments that are purely cheesy - but I love it.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|Some of these new games are just no fun when you have to have so many neighbors or energy or what ever. Its just disapointing.
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|I was told this was a great movie so I bought it.  I watched it, but didn't love it.  I ended up giving it to the person who told me it was great because I am sure I will never watch it again.  They were thrilled with the gift and have watched it a number of times since I gave it to them.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Like I said, I love suspense and mystery. Gillian Flynn, who I had never heard of, is an excellent writer. I will definately purchase more of her novels in the future.
B005LAII12|4.0|okay, so i'm not the biggest fan of 'family guy'. sometimes it's funny and clever and easy to watch.  other times i find it inane and redundant and i need to turn it off.  so it was fairly easy to be open-minded about this latest offering by seth macfarlane.  overall, it was funny and entertaining....but it had a few shortcomings.  of course, the hook is the talking teddy bear voiced by seth (the voice of peter griffin and brian the dog on his show 'family guy').  and with this hook, seth figured he didn't need to focus on giving the movie a plot.  the basic premise is standard chick flick fare: a typical party-animal bozo who refuses to grow up (played well by mark wahlberg) has a very pretty girlfriend who's too good for him (played wonderfully by mila kunis from family guy and that 70s show). she tries to get him to grow up and when he fails to meets expectations and messes up one time too often, she dumps him.  everyone is sad and miserable until the obligatory final chase scene which occurs because some psycho kidnaps the talking teddy bear.<br />so seth figured the comedy and hook overshadowed the need for plot.......and he wasn't too far off the mark.  there was enough profanity and humor to make this an entertaining flick.  comedy is often based on sex, drugs, hookers and macfarlane's own satirical view of the society in which we live.  it's not a movie for kids.  but i found it clever in spots, good for a number of laughs and over all a worthwhile film for a mindless comedy experience.  the entire cast performed well with a 4-star (though pointless) script.....with appearances by sam jones (tv's flash gordon), nora jones and the guy who played david putty on tv's seinfeld.  it's not a brilliant movie or poignant or impressive from a ciematic point of view.....but it's a fun watch, mindlessly entertaining and good for some laughs.....occassionally a few big laughs.  the c.g. effects with the animated bear were well-done and combined with seth's characterization of the weed-smoking stuffed animal, it made for a reasonably believable and likable role in the film.  in closing, there was not much of a plot, but the script was nearly funny and entertaining enough to pull thru even with that handicap.  fun characters and good acting by a respectable cast helped to make this an enjoyable flick.  i think you should give it a chance.......laughing can't hurt you.
B00633W614|5.0|Could not put this book down .  I loved the whole series from Jeffrey Archer.  Great interesting reading.I was spell bound.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|It's not gonna give you a razor edge but it's decent and compact enough to take<br />anywhere. Good for sharpening something away from from home.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Don't get to it very much as I am always reading but when I do -it is great to have on my kindle.  When in a Doctor's office or waiting somewhere -it is a neat pasttime..Great pasttime
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Not like any near death experience books I have read.  It is overwhelming with very technical information but so honest about now believing more than ever before on this subject.  This book is comforting to know someone could share this journey with such truth.
B004WKI204|3.0|It started off witty and really funny. Halfway through, I am struggling to finish as it has become a bit boring
B0034DGPEU|4.0|It is such a reminder of the strife our early Americans went through.  The writer has a way of being sure you connect as a friend of the characters and disrespect the violent ones.  The scenery is touching as well.
B00631VJIC|3.0|Love this shows' music, but was a little disappointed with the soundtrack.  There were TONS of other songs besides what they chose that wouldve made a badass cd.  Its still good, but I listened to it a few times and packed away it is.  Not worth buying new.
B00AZ3KPZC|5.0|I can't say enough about Peter Pan as a movie, and the HD version is amazing.  It's a vast improvement from the version I watched growing  up!
B00A8KJK7G|4.0|Very cute movie, great for animal lovers of any age.  I love Tim Burton, this is a great addition to my collection.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|I didn't have very high hopes for this movie, but I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised.  It's adorable and funny, and my son loves it.  He walks around the house pretending to be Frankenstein.  :)<br /><br />Definitely check it out - it's a great family movie!
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|This album is a personal album and is slightly different then her last album.  There are tear jerkers and then there are some party songs.  I can't wait to see if it goes on tour.  I'm a huge Xtina fan, so this is a winner for me.
0525953590|5.0|Once again Sean Carrol has done it!!  I love physics and if you do..you will like this book as well!!
B001DJ7PMI|5.0|If you're a JFK fan and you believe, as I do, in a conspiracy, then this is the movie for you.  I think Oliver Stone does a great job weaving all of the conspiracy theories together, making a well paced , even riveting movie that will keep your attention over 3 hours.  The extra 17 minutes included simply fills in a few small plot holes and extends some scenes in the movie, but it still makes a great movie even better.<br />  I would recommend this 2 disc edition, not only for the extended cut of the movie ,but also for the bonus features on the second disk that are very interesting.  I do want to say to people that are new to the movie that this isn't meant to be a historical drama.  The movie encourages you to seek the truth on your own.  As Kevin Costner says at the end of the movie it really is up to you.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Any Nathan Fillion fans will love his take on Richard Castle - brilliantly written, intriguing storylines every week, in-depth characters that you'll grow to care about more than you'll care to admit... Captain Mal is alive and well, complete with bullet-proof vest and witty banter!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|If you love horses than this is an absolute must have horse app.  The game is very realistic and fun to play.  It's great that you get to participate in the training an competitions.
B00AEK9BKQ|1.0|The storyline sounded good, the actors sounded excellent, but still the movie failed for me.  I did not find the movie funny or heartwarming.  Even half way through the movie I didn't care about any of the actors, which is strange because I cry watching Bambi!  I was never drawn into the movie, I felt like everyone was just going through the motions, never connecting.  I know that I am in the minority with all the 5 stars this movie is getting, but my advice would be to borrow it from your local library and save your money!
B000HL0EEE|5.0|This is every bit as much Star Trek as The original Series, or Next Generation.  But it is the first Star Trek Series that uses no models.  Everyting is CGI.  So rich people will never have the opportunity to put little space ship models from the show in their conference rooms.
B004RZGUBM|3.0|In tribute to the bicentennial of the birth of Charles Dickens, Delphi Classics is pleased to introduce Dickensiana, a first of its kind e-compilation of period accounts of Dickens’ life and works, rare 19th and early 20th century books and articles about Dickens and Dickensian locales, reminiscences by family, friends and colleagues, tribute poems, parodies, satires and sequels based on his works and much more, spiced with an abundance of vintage images. from Delphi Classics.<br /><br />DICKENS, CHARLES (2011-03-12).

B004XUMMFE|1.0|I don't even remember what this was about and I saw it less than an hour ago.  Three More Word.
B004CHURRS|5.0|Natalie Dessay can do little wrong, and her high-spirited collection of arias from Handel's &#34;Giulio Cesare&#34; reinforces her reputation as an exquisite interpreter of Baroque and bel canto opera. Listeners admittedly lose the context for these arias, but most will be happy to skip the recitatives and the daunting length of the complete opera. It's a great album.
B00846REIS|5.0|Not over ravishing, a realistic romance. With sexual desire from two people in love with pasts they face daily in their own special way
B0007MWZEK|5.0|We have used these for years. Now have one for each floor of 2 homes! Still have the original that i now use in the basement. The Swivel Sweeper has proven effective for picking up crumbs, hair, pet food nuggets, etc from hard surfaces or short pile carpet. Works best on hard surfaces. Periodic cleaning keeps sweeper working well. If you are lazy and never clean the brushes, you will not get the best results. Most folks completely forget there is a small filter to clean. Keep it clean - it is crucial to air flow to allow effective pick up. These do not replace a vacuum, but are great for quick pick ups and reduce the amount of vacuuming you will need to do. Do not use on long shag or other thick carpet if it gets caught or bogs way down When used properly, these are the greatest cleaning tool I have seen. Worth having even just for kitchen use - hard surfaces are the perfect surface for these. I do use them on our short carpets though for surface pickup. Oh - and this $23 price is amazing!!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|This is a good spin on a great detective story.  It is entertaining and thought provoking all at the same time.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|This is a Pocket Pal. I first bought one about 6 yrs ago for $10. Used it like crazy. Works very well. Use it on all my pocketknives and some kitchen knives. Handiest sharpener around. Finally needed to get a new one - glad to see it $2 less. If it goes down another $1, I'll give it a 5
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Easy read, but grasps you.  Couldn't put it down.  Dr. Alexander isn't of my religion, but everything he is explaining, is what I actually believe is true and have faith in.  It's amazing to hear true accounts of what I believe is true, that 99% of other religions don't, including his own.<br /> Not a religious book at all, but anyone who has faith in different realms of this life will truly enjoy this read.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I read all the negative reviews on this book and then went ahead and bought it anyway.  Part of me actually wanted to agree with those negative reviews but the more I read the more I realized this story was, sadly, quite believable.  Gillian Flynn has hit our often sick society right on the head.  You may hate Amy and Nick (and even Ms. Flynn for creating them) but as you read you realize these people really exist in one form or another in our society.  Perhaps a sad commentary but nonetheless true.<br /><br />I agree with all the comments about it being sick and twisted but it is also brilliant.
B0015FN05Q|5.0|Enjoyed this one is school, and still enjoy reading it.  It makes you wonder why we are the way we are.  So stressed out all the time.  This book allowed me to relax.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|I would recommend this movie to anyone who would like to escape for a couple of hours.  It's a blow-em-up, far-fetched, good-feeling movie. It takes you back to your childhood when you used to go the the Saturday matinee's.  (Those of you who are old enough to remember that)
B00AREIAI8|4.0|its a good app fun and all but I wish there was an easier way 2 get energy 4 my horse. I wish the horses were cheaper but besides those 2 things its really fun
B007MJSQSK|4.0|Good for viewing, probably would not watch again for awhile.  Always like Spielberg movies and new directions.  Son encouraged us to watch
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The third season of The Walking dead contains all of the scenarios and situations that zombiephiles complained were missing during the first two \\"boring\\" seasons. And it's done in a realistic and believable (for the presented situation) way that makes connecting the dots from the first two seasons show how Grime's band of weary souls could have made it to this point.
B007REV4T8|4.0|I'm a James Bond fan and Skyfall didn't disappoint. Would highly recommend.Of course the action was off the charts. I like Daniel Craig as Bond.
B009IF8CH6|1.0|hello, so i bought the episode so that i could watch it right away because i have somewhere to be soon. But as soon as i bought it and tried to play it it kept skipping and then stopped playing altogether. I love the show so i was really disappointed when this happened. I wanted to write an email to amazon to complain but this works just as well i guess. If i wanted a low quality skipping episode i would have watched it for free elsewhere. this is beyond frustrating. Amazon is just getting worse and worse.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|My son suggested that I watch season one on Netflix. I was so addicted, I bought season two and season three on Amazon and watched both seasons in two days on my laptop! I have never been so enamored with the series. I wish they would make more!
B003U4ZQRK|5.0|This is such a great show and season 5 is no exception. It's an edge of your seat series that I recommend to anyone.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Wonderful period show! Love the costumes and all that it shows.  The story lines are great. You feel like a part of the family!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Awesome app. Great way to relax while feeding the spatial/cognitive part of your brain. It is a very Zen game.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book is great. It has given me some peace of mind. I believed there was something after this life, but since my husband's passing 7 months ago I had some doubts.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I think this was the best game I downloaded so far.<br />When I wanted to download games that I have on my computer it showed &#34;no plug in&#34; How can I get a &#34;plug in&#34;?
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love using the fb app! I use the app more than I do on my computer if I am not playing games.
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|there are many stacks for that size screen and if you make them bigger then you can't see the entire game
B008XG1X18|5.0|Easy to use and love having it on my kindel. Makes it nice to have it when every I want to get on and not have to get on the computer.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I thought Temple Run was fun, but then Temple Run 2 came out and it was addicting!!! I strongly recommend this game!!!!!!!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. It had a decent story line and a good variety of puzzles<br />The free version actually has a good stopping point but the paid version continues the story.
B0097PW7H8|5.0|LOTS OF IMPROVEMENT IN THE BATTERY. FIRDT MINE ONLY LASTED 6hr BUT NOW.......11hr 32 mins. a must get! I love it! It can manage my charging and it told me the most power consuming app. IT SAVED MY LIFE.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|It is good.  One of the best 007 movies but I don't think it deserved all the extreme Hype it was given before its release.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Scary but keeps u wanting more (in a good way :)) good mix of puzzles and hidden objects. Will be purchasing more g5 games in the future.
B0049J2BSM|4.0|Entertaining and funny.<br />Rented and watched it last night.<br />I was as I expected it to be.  Funny and decent.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|A bittersweet ending. A new adventure following. I hope 's peregrine manages to change back. I feel bad for the children. I hope they stop the winches and hollows,too. It was a little bit short though.
B001UGB1X8|3.0|I watched this movie because Tommy Lee stared and it was filmed in southwest Louisiana.  The movie was just OK.  Acting was fairly good, story line was a step below.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love this app! It actually works and makes you fall asleep really quickly! I would recommend this app to anyone who has sleep problems or would like to test it out.
B000NUXAUO|5.0|I love this album i got it a while ago on here and it is a great album !Especially if you love the 70's elvis and how much his voice could do in this era. I really Would suggest this for any fan or anybody
030758836X|1.0|I would love to red this book, but I am not going to pay more for a kindle edition of the book than I am for the paperback.<br /><br />Pricing for kindle books is out of control!
B005FG2IFY|5.0|This is a great substitute for the full version of Treasure Island.  This book is true to the original storyline and is very well written.  My class loves it and is able to fully enjoy the story.
B006XF5BTG|4.0|I lost a bunch of weight (nearly 50 lbs.) and ended up just skinny. My goal was to add back some muscle but my old method of doing 'light reps' wasn't working. I was spending hours in the gym, hating it, with nothing to show. After giving this book a try, really almost like magic muscle definition started to appear after a couple of weeks and keeps getting better. I'm not worn out, spend fifty minutes tops in the gym (usually 30-40), and really look forward to going back. This method is simple, fast, and efficient - it just plain works.
0425252868|5.0|What a wonderful story of how two people from different worlds came together during a war.  It shows human life is important regardless of who is at fault.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is without a doubt app the best bible app available. When some thing is that good less words describe it the best. This app will enhance any Christian's relationship with God. What a blessing.
B00BJG7H3M|2.0|Suits is by far one of the most intriguing glimpses inside the environs of law without dumbing the audience down.  Not so with season two's finale, \\"War\\".  It was presented as a quickly thrown together mishmash of story lines straight off the chopping block.  It was confusing to say the least.  The characters seemed disoriented and distracted with where they belonged in the story as well.  Suits is crisp, smart, a no-holds-barred saga that has been watched from its beginning.  This is the first of which a commentary was felt greatly needed.  It will continue to be viewed faithfully, yet with the hope everyone wises up and gets some apparent greatly needed off season rest.<br />Best of luck to all involved.
B001F6ZIXW|3.0|Seems like a lot of VoiceOver work. Seems like they made this film at a reduced cost. The plot is ok kind of predictable. I'm going to continue the series, I'm only half way throught season 1
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Shows how the food industry really works. I would highly recommend.  But now I really don't want to eat any more packaged food.

B009IH0ICG|5.0|I grew up with these and it is much smaller than what is required for a full size barbecue, but it's just the right size for me.  For anyone contemplating this over lighter fluid, please try this!  The food tastes so much better and it's easier and safer than lighter fuel.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Downloaded this as a FAOTD.  It is the kind of game that you can pick up and put down when you just have a few moments. You do have to be fast!
B009IJJB8G|5.0|This is an excellent series with a lot of good character development.  As a new twist to Sherlock Holmes, I am glad that they keep Sherlock very much like his original character in the books.  Things like his addiction, his unique skill sets, and his quotes are all taken from the books.  Even some of the more famous Sherlock Holmes lines are uttered in this series.  Watson is also an excellent character but they take more liberties with her development.  However, I do not find this as a negative aspect but instead as a great way to revamp the series while still keeping key features (such as the background as a surgeon).  Overall, this is a worthwhile series to watch and I look forward to more.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Love the history. Would loved to have seen these guys in person.  Great book.  Easy read.  One two three four for enough words

159315724X|5.0|This book is a distillation of many personal development books. It is very well done and gives the reader specific ways to put the ideas into practice.<br /><br />I Have been reading personal development books for many many years. This is one of the my favorites and I have recommended it to all my family and friends.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|So far I love this app and it is helpful. There is s lot of things to learn from this app and I love it.
B004Y6CS8I|4.0|SBTRKT album is truly amazing and if you are into the amazing electronic and acoustic drum sound then this album is not one to miss. The vocals just add to the amazing sounds of the album and for the price for this album it is defiantly worth it!<br /><br />The quality it came in was almost perfect. It lost a star as the corners of the album were a little squished but this did not effect the CD at all which worked a treat!
0345536886|5.0|This book will take you away froim every day drudgery.<br />Get a copyh for yourself as soon as possible.<br />You can't go wrong with this one.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I LOVE THIS SHOW.IT'S GREAT. I BOUGHT SEASON 1, 2, 3, I CAN'T WAIT FOR SEASON FOUR. I'VE WATCHED THIS OVER AND OVER. I'M ADDICTED TO THIS SHOW. THERE'S ALWAYS A SURPISE.
B001Q9J4PG|5.0|as expected from Clancey, a spell binding page turner. looking forward to the next one. and reading my first book on a Kindle was a treat.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THIS SHOW. I WATCH THIS SO I CAN ESCAPE THE TRIALS OF THE DAY. CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT IT.
B009ERK1T0|4.0|I can appreciate the deftones musical ambition. They're artists plan and simple. They wanna grow with each album. Test the waters and see what hits and what misses. I dig that risk taking most bands fear of but not the deftones. Where some bands keep pumping out the same old crap year after year. The deftones experiment. I applaud them for that. So yeah some albums hit and miss as a fan I can admit that. I'm telling you this album is amazing. You can literally hear their artistry in their music. So bottom line haters will always hate. True fans will buy this album and if you're not do yourself a favor buy this and see what art really sounds like.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|Works great with my D90.  Plenty of power.  Much better than the standard on camera flash.  Love the bounce feature. Fits easily in a jacket pocket too.  Very satisfied.  Ordering and delivery was easy and fast.  Thanks!
0061726834|5.0|I love when I can get lost in a novel like this. I enjoyed the characters and their challenges. I also love when characters grow and develop within a story!
B000HF0ISC|5.0|Excellent movie!!! A must see for all!!!<br />IMO, this movie is not for children under 17. I love Kevin Bacon in this movie!
0061978078|5.0|I read this in under a day and thoroughly enjoyed it! I appreciate how the author made Lena upset but not so pathetic that we lose sympathy for her. I enjoyed the growth and change of the characters and even enjoyed the way the novel switched from then to now, though I was hesitant about it in the beginning.<br />A great read and so far I recommend this series!
1401937268|5.0|The instruction manual is really helpful and the cards are, wrap carefully and comes in excellent condition, the drawings on the cards are beautiful, hadn't had time to check if the readings are 100% accurate but i will find out soon lol<br /><br />I just love them

B008NW67E0|5.0|By far one of the best albums I have ever bought. I love this band with a passion. Number one band!!
B000WAEJZ0|1.0|Sound quality of this CD is below average. Sounds like a copy CD. Bought &#34;Whitney Houston - The Greatest Hits&#34; instead. The sound quality is totally different. It's good that the seller refunded me the money!
B009AMAK54|4.0|I enjoyed this movie despite the baseball theme.  It's really not about baseball, though; rather, it's a look at a father-daughter relationship that could be more.  And by the first plot point, we can see that they will have no choice but to face their differences.  It's entertaining to watch as the daughter learns to empathize with her aging father, as he comes to terms with it as well.  Very touching, but I gave it four stars because it wrapped a little too neatly at the end when the daughter tries her hand at her dad's trade.
1449415881|3.0|This calendar is just okay. My view may be jaded since it took Amazon three weeks to get it to me, but as soon as I opened the box I was disappointed with the paper quality; it's very thin and rips easily. The binding on top of the calendar is the same and I needed to tape it down so that it wouldn't continue to rip. As far as the content goes, I can't complain about Dilbert! The stand holding up the calendar is very sturdy - no complaints there.
B004UNX1LS|5.0|This is a must have app for anyone that wants to watch music videos. The video quality is amazing and you can save playlists.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|Beautifully written story of one woman's Sadhana (spiritual path) full of insights, inspirations, lessons and the wisdom garnered from those lessons.
B0088P2A7A|3.0|This app seems to work fine, but I prefer a bigger screen when researching something. This app doesn't have any perks.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|After having read Winter of the World I had a moré objective view of World War Two.it was great to be Able to continúe reading about some of the characters of Book 1, Fall of the Giants.I could imagine What was going on in different countries at the same times e many things made sense.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Good game very cool been playing it for hrs and I love it it could use more building options but a all around great game
B008QMMEOE|2.0|You get the first few levels free but then you have to pay to go to the next one. They should let you know that upfront. I'm using it to teach my grandaughter and its just not enough.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|i love it its fun challenging and fun! its something for everyone. it can be for children or adults! you can even play while eating Mac and cheese!I love love love this!
B008B68IUY|5.0|I bought this for my daughter for Christmas! She was totally surprised! She had no idea that it was available! She is a monster high fanatic!
B005K0HDGE|3.0|I like Kings book, not my favorite author, but a change when i need one. I've read a lot of his books, and this one had an interesting concept, but it would have been better without soo much tedious info.  About 200 pages less would have been better book to me.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|The book never stopped producing the thrill of the hunt from the begining. Tom Clancy did a fantastic job of making us guess what was around the next corner. The book kept me on edge the whole time I was reading, and I often found myself not being able to put it down when I had other matters needing my attention. Shame on you Tom for writing such a fantastic book. HaHaHa Loved it!!!
B0095P29EG|4.0|This is a fun movie. Well done.  Lots of action and special effects too. It l leaves you wanting more.
B0082Z447U|5.0|Very convincing.  Some what sad story.  Kept me awake reading all night.  I recommend this novel.  I felt so sorry for the little girl dressed in white, it was like a premonition..... :-(
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Lots of great twists & turns. Kept me wanting for more & I didn't want to put it down!  Can't wait to read the next installment!
B00A4OALL0|5.0|This is the finest jazz album I have heard in a few years.  Wayne is not getting tired, he is getting better.<br /><br />The ensemble is individually remarkable and they play telepathically.  The writing is provocative and among his best tunes - which is saying a lot.<br /><br />Just when I was getting tired of jazz and was thinking that the genre's best was behind it, Wayne comes back and shows me what it all means.<br /><br />I just wish I had more than five stars to award.
B004V5A7K8|4.0|This game is a good way to kill some time.  I liked to play it when bored. I liked the arcade version of this game better than the other side of it. I played it on my Kindle.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|very high quality and a very low price.<br />this i a great movie, to play with your home theatre...<br />excellent
B0041KBWM0|4.0|Cute and funny and great for a relaxing evening.  I liked the costumes and the beautiful scenery.  The acting was fine.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love this versionof Temple Run.  The graphics are amazing and the new additions to the game make it very exciting.  Can't wait to play.
B004QX07G4|1.0|I wanted a biography, not this. I did not finish it and it was a waste of money. It basically was a list of comedy routines, not funny. I got bored and didn't finish it.
B005LAJ1HW|5.0|HBO continues to prove why they are the leader in original content with the sophomore season of the terrific &#34;Boardwalk Empire.&#34; While the first season focused on introducing us to the characters, hierarchy, and culture of 1920's Atlantic City, this season ups the ante for almost every character involved in the show. While Nucky Thompson (played by the brilliant Steve Buscemi) enjoys his spot atop the Atlantic City food chain, other major players in town want to see Nucky's reign of power come to an end, particularly Nucky's former enforcer and student James Darmody (played by Michael Pitt). Most of the season focuses on the power struggle between these two, the alignment of the other characters as they choose (or are forced) which side to support, and the inevitable consequences these alignments bring.<br /><br />As is the case in season one, the second season continues to boast powerful and award-winning performances from it's strong cast. As mentioned earlier, Buscemi is undoubtedly great as Thompson, who sees his world come crashing down yet refuses to give in. Pitt, who I felt had a smaller and softer role in the first season, really steps up his game here and gives a terrific performance. Another impressive nod has to go to Michael Shannon, whose characters deals with a lot of demons this season and must come to grips with the bad decisions he's made, all while trying to bring justice to the booze-ridden Atlantic City. I could go on about each individual member of the cast but let me suffice by saying that the entire crew is top-notch and is one of the reasons for this show's success.<br /><br />The Blu-ray set itself packs quite a punch; not only do you get the entire season in HD, you also get it in DVD format, AS WELL as digitally. I'm a huge fan of combo packs and digital copies but usually only see them included in movies. I was very happy to be able to add this season to my digital collection via iTunes redemption code. There's also a few featurettes and making-of shorts that give a good glimpse into the world of the Boardwalk Empire.<br /><br />This show continues to impress and if you enjoyed the first season, you're sure to enjoy this one as well.ttes and making-of shorts that give a good glimpse into the world of the Boardwalk Empire.<br /><br />This show continues to impress and if you enjoyed the first season, you're sure to enjoy this one as well.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I loved this book! It was a complete shock to me in the end, what a twist! Can't wait to start on the next book!
1439196834|5.0|If you're a fan of How I Met Your Mother you will be a fan of this title.<br />Not only is it packed full of hilarity, it references the show on multiple occasions, and even caused me to meditate a bit on the human condition. Deep stuff, I know.<br /><br />Anyway, I love how to book is organized. It goes from easy plays in the beginning to the toughest of plays towards the end, ending, of course, with &#34;The Scuba Diver.&#34; Because of this, you can be sure to start trying out plays right away and become even more awesome.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|Very hard to stump Akinater the Genie.  The whole family had fun trying.  Buy it, it's something your entire family will have fun with.
B002NVTSGQ|5.0|Fantastic show- witty dialogue, wonderful characters and just hilarious. Impressive how they are always able to bring the divergent story lines together in an extremely satisfying way.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This game is so much fun! Multiplayer to solo! I lose track of time a lot when i play! I also like how you can even select more characters than having to delete one to start a new fighter.
0446580848|3.0|Not as good as his previous books, and I have read them all. This novel has too much narrative, most of it glib one-liners, and not enough action.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think this game is great and challenging. you guyed should so play I mean really who wouldnt want to play the love it.
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|Wreck it Ralph is very cute movie. Kids loved it, they laughed and giggled through the whole movie!<br />Excellent download quality!

B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great book, you will laugh and cry! Great read, easy to follow. Just what you have come to expect from Nick Sparks!<br />Keep up the good work!
1452110581|5.0|Just read the samples, if you like them, you'll love the book! Each poem is from the cat's own perspective on how they see us and the things around them. You'll laugh 'til you cry!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I could not put down this book! I loved it all the way up until the very end. Can't wait to read the other two!
B005KP7EK4|1.0|So Blackthorne/Butch Cassidy decides it's time to mosey on back to the States twenty years after he was killed in Bolivia. He cashes out (he's a successful horse wrangler/trainer) and sets off across the barren wastes to America, a leisurely three year ride. He finds a dead horse, with empty saddlebags next to it, an obvious bushwhack scenario, but he's oblivious and and follows the tracks and BLAM, he's bushwhacked. He's not hit but his very well trained horse takes off for the horizon, along with all his money of course, never to be seen again. Did I mention he's the most renowned horse trainer in Bolivia?<br /><br />From this humble and ridiculous beginning comes a boring and unnecessary movie, about nothing much. But it's free with Prime so find out for yourself.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Didn't want this book to end! I really enjoyed Gone Girl from cover to cover. This one is a must read!
B0044C5SCU|5.0|I've enjoyed watching this series on Amazon.  I was pleasantly surprised at he quality of the show.  I recommend it, if you haven't seen it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|So awesome best horse game ever. Love it so much love the computation and races. I love how you can have more than horse at a time.
B00AKEMHCA|3.0|but for some reason it wont work and I don't  know if its cuz I'm on my kindle or not.
B009I0QTF8|5.0|This is reminiscent of classic funk albums.  his arrangement and selection are on point!<br />great listen through and through.  definitely a part of my chill-time list!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|A true love story that keeps you engulfed the whole time! A very enchanting read for any romantic! A great book overall!
1250027624|5.0|Who doesn't love 'Downton Abbey'! Well, maybe a couple of Rednecks who can't think beyond pick-up trucks, hound dogs, and good-old-boy American movies. I have the boxed sets of all three seasons of 'Downton Abbey' in my library and two very fine books on the subject. As that little lad in the novel and films says: &#34;Please, Sir, can I have more?&#34;
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Can't figure out how to play.  Want to delete but cant figure that our either.  Don't like this program. at all.
B009POCG0Y|5.0|Based on an early play by Oklahoma's own Pulitzer Prize and Tony winning playwright, Tracy Letts, this one gets as down and dirty as possible for today's screens. The performances are excellent and quite disgusting characters parade across our screen making us feel we need to run away and protect outselves! Go Tracy! You make us proud!
1592407889|5.0|I found this to be such an easy read, always compelling me to read more.  By the end of the book, I didn't want it to end and put it down for two nights just to prolong it.  Mother/Daughter relationships can be complex and in this book it shows that being a celebrity doesn't change that fact.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is so much fun one of the things I like about it is you can unlock cool backgrounds and swords you can cut the fruit with.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Don't have HBO and I was thrilled to find this on Amazon at a decent price that I can just keep in the cloud. Loved the series, it really followed the first book closely. I watched it all in one sitting, I was so engrossed in it! Buy this, if you are a Game of Thrones fan, you will love it too.
B004AGI2L4|5.0|It was a great movie. Filled in the missing parts of the story from &#34;The Eagle&#34;.<br />It was a bit gory in the beginning. The battle scenes were probably very realistic.<br />It was a movie that both my husband and I watched and enjoyed.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I've read all the books and really liked them so when I saw the series on Amazon I bought it instantly. Hate waiting week after week to see what's going to happen, this is perfect for me. I had a marathon and watched all ten at once yesterday in the cloud just like I did with season one. Loved it!!! Now will patiently wait for the next one next year. Will probably watch the first two seasons a couple of times in the meantime too. This is a great story, not for kids though, lots of profanity and nudity here and there but be warned about that. I don't think they even knew the f word back then haha. Anyway the books did not seem as graphic to me at all. Anyway still an excellent series, and I will still be buying them as they come out.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have grandchildren who LOVES this game ages range from 2 to 7 I watch them pass my kindle from one little pair of hands to the next I watched to see what was going on and now I'm with them saying its my turn.... We Love This Subway Surfer Game.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|I've seen all of the Bond films and this was like a retrospect on the old and new Bond persona.  The villain was not quite the devious villains of old.  As usual the stunts, gimmicks and set locations were all fantastic.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Wonderful story.  We really enjoyed  watching the episodes without interruption, and at our own time.  I would recommend this series to anyone who enjoys a good tale with colorful characters.
B00AMSLRAC|4.0|My ten  and seven both enjoyed the game! Easy to use and good quality graphics.<br />We would recommend to others!
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I love this game!  I have played it on my friends opossum and got it for my kindle, but don't know how to sign in as a new player. I have uninstalled and reinstalled before?!?!?!?!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read and very exciting and fun to read! I would read it over and over
B007Q0K9TE|5.0|Great CD if you are an Anre Rieu fan!  I bought this CD for my mother and she loves it!
B00B7803HO|5.0|I always try to avoid series-types.  However, at a dinner party with some very intelligent, friendly rich, acquaintances, all they wanted to talk about was Downton Abbey.  Well, I don't want to be left out in the cold with something good, so I watched .We only have 2 episodes left to watch , so I hope #4 is in the making and this becomes another long-running program like \\"DALLAS\\" or \\"MASH\\".  I will never miss an episode unless I am sick in hospital, and even then, they will have a TV I am sure.  We can always record if we cannot be home on the night it is on.  I am 100% American, white middle class, husband a Colonel in the US Army, flew airplanes and helicopters.  We have been to England 4 times to visit, my 2 best friends are British, and I believe God put me in the wrong time AND country!!!  I would probably have been one of the ladies maids (can't cook!) but somehow I would have lived in a big house like that too.  My favorite characters are Maggie Smith and Mr. Bates and Anna.  Oh yes, I love the little kitchen maid, Daisy.  Such scruples, honesty and cuteness.  I would love to see her go and work father-in-laws farm.  Neither of them have anyone.  I just love everything about the series.  I live in a senior citizen community with a club house.  Maybe we will start a \\"tea\\" movie discussion.  This is just great stuff.  Please continue making more episodes.  Yours from Tennessee ,  Anma Sandy
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love my horse because its great practice for kids who have horses and and for adults its fun too!!!!!
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I enjoy this alarm on my Kindle,  knowing that I do not have to use my mobile or home alarm clock all the time. my only criticism is that if my Kindle is in sleep mode and the alarm goes off,  I have to swipe the screen first to access the clock.
B000H7J9QM|5.0|Although the movie itself is a little cheesy the beautiful cars and amazing car chase at the end really pulls it together into something I can watch over and over.
0307456633|5.0|I loved her thinking--common sense and morals!  I had trouble with the names.  The descriptions of the surroundings were great.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|This whole set of books is amazing. It has a little something for everyone action, adventure, romance,etc. The story can get pretty dark, but it just makes the story all the more real.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|The book was written so anyone could understand, even the technical medical things.  I had trouble putting it down.  What a great experience,  glad he shared.
B008GVD6D8|3.0|This author knows how to write a story that keeps you enthralled right up to the end.Look forward to reading her next novel.
0446554995|1.0|P&C have finally done it. Taken one of the most compelling characters in current literature and made him a absolute joke.  What's with the ever expanding goofy story lines?  Plug Pendergast into a interesting, realistic story and you would have sure fire winner.  Having read all of the P&C books, I must say this will be the last one I purchase.  Maybe the library if I'm desperate.  If you like Pendergast and want to see what might have been, start with Cabinet of Curiosities.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I think this game is fantastic, for the young ones and for the whole family, they can view the puzzles that they like, and you have a good selection of them, it's amazing.
B0073PPKNM|4.0|Great CD. The quality of the music is excellent and so is the content. Also the sound of this CD is clean and well recorded. If you like female Jazz interpreters you will like Melody Gardot.

B004LWZWGK|2.0|Nolan Again Impresses...<br />...with his ability to obfuscate.<br /><br />I do realize that I'm going to be in the vast minority with my stance on The Dark Knight Rises, but I'm used to that, so I'm just going to go with it.<br /><br />I have one thing to say for Christopher Nolan: he's a magician when it comes to making movies. I mean that in a very literal sense. He uses flashy action to distract us from the holes he leaves behind in the story. We can't see them, because we're too busy looking in the other direction.<br /><br />Or maybe it's just that Marvel has set the bar so high with their string of excellent adaptions that I'm just no longer satisfied with interpretations. Maybe if it was more explicit that these are interpretations, I'd be happier. DC/Warner Brothers could just slap their Elseworlds label on  these things, and I might be more accepting of them. As it is, though, there are so many things that aren't Batman in these movies that I have a hard time dealing with it. Like in Burton's Batman when Alfred brings Vicki Vale down into the Batcave. What?<br /><br />Unfortunately, Nolan has plenty of those moments himself. Like in Batman Begins when Wayne allows Lucius Fox to know that he's Batman. Whereas that was almost acceptable in that movie, those inconsistencies with the source material have continued to snowball to the point that by the time we get to Rises, I can't accept them. I mean, by the end of The Dark Knight Rises half of everyone knows that Wayne is Batman. And we're just supposed to believe that some random cop walks up to Wayne and just knows? Seriously. I get that Nolan needs that for his story, but, give me a break, he knew because he saw it in Wayne's face? At least Tim Drake did the research to figure out that Wayne is Batman. And I don't want to give spoilers, but having his actual name be Robin? It just makes me cringe.<br /><br />However, the big issue for me, the thing that set the big disconnect for me, is that we're supposedto believe that this is 8 years later. That Bruce Wayne just quit being Batman and went into seclusion. I get that Nolan is trying to give us a sense of Miller's Dark Knight comics in which Batman had quit and was in seclusion, but that was because he got old. He even gives us a cane like Wayne uses in Batman Beyond, but, again, in those he got old; Nolan wants us to believe that Wayne just quit. I can't buy it. I absolutely can not buy it.<br /><br />This is where I understand the difference between me, someone that grew up reading Batman comics and was heavily invested in Batman lore for...well, longer than I should have been, and the vast majority of people out there that don't have that same investment. These details aren't important to them. I get that. I also get that I am not really the target audience for the movie. I was the target audience for Batman Begins, because that one was more focused on the fans of the comic, but these last two, after hooking everyone in, have been focused on the general consumer.<br /><br />Even so, the idea with Nolan's Batman is that he is set in the &#34;real world,&#34; and, as such, I still can not accept this 8 year hiatus. He wants us to buy into too many unrealistic ideas:<br />1. After 8 years of no Batman, people are still talking about him. Give me a break. Culturally, we barely hold onto anything for 8 days, and Nolan expects us to believe that people are still saying, after 8 years, &#34;is he coming back?&#34; Not to mention the fact that he has kids, like 10-year-old kids, talking about Batman as if he's a reality to them. Or was a reality to them. Yes, all of this bothers me, because none of it's how the real world works.<br />If he'd made it a year after the events of Dark Knight, maybe even two, it would have been plausible.<br />2. There's a Harvey Dent Day and people care about it. See point 1. No one would care after 8 years. Well, they wouldn't care beyond the fact that it was a day off from work. And it's not clear that they, the common people, do get a day off from work.<br />3. After 8 years, Wayne just puts the suit back on, and it's like he never quit. There are so many problems with this:<br /><br />There is an implication, a strong implication, that Wayne has been doing nothing to &#34;stay in shape&#34; during his seclusion (except, maybe, shooting some arrows). He's just been sulking about. Bodies deteriorate pretty quickly. After just a few months, he would have lost his edge and begun losing muscle mass. After a year, it would have taken considerable training to be able to get back into shape. After 8 years?<br />Aside from the staying in shape aspect of it, Wayne has definitely not been sparring or doing any kind of combat training in those 8 years. As an example of what not sparring can do, you can look at the Foreman/Ali championship fight. Foreman was unable to spar for the entire month leading up to the bout due to an eye injury, and just that one month of not training threw his fighting off so much that he couldn't compete. (Ali won and refused to ever allow Foreman a re-match.)<br />On top of all the not staying in shape and not sparring, Wayne has suffered some sort of debilitating injury that has caused him to need a cane to walk. His body is in bad shape. No, it's in horrible shape. So... 8 years of lounging in seclusion and he can't even walk under his own power, but we're supposed to believe that a high tech knee brace returns him to fighting form? Are you kidding me?<br />While it is true that Alfred voiced concern over these issues, it was given in the sense that it would be a &#34;bad idea&#34; to get back into costume. In truth, it would have been an impossibility. Not to put the costume back on but certainly impossible to be Batman again just like that.<br /><br />If Nolan wants us to believe that this is a Batman that could be in the real world, he needs to keep him in the real world. And don't get me started on the &#34;fusion bomb,&#34; because all of that was just bad science. I'll buy into Wayne creating a fusion reactor, but not turning it into a &#34;time bomb&#34; in the way it was done in the movie. They're equating it to a meltdown in a nuclear reactor, and those things just don't happen on a schedule. Not to mention the last minute save after 5 months. It just doesn't get more cliche than that.<br /><br />Nolan also uses sleight-of-hand to hide facts from us. I don't have an issue with this in a general sense, but it takes away from the enjoyment of watching it again. He did this very successfully in The Prestige, because, in that one, he gave us the clues to figure out what was going on so that when the reveal happened it was your own fault for not figuring it out. I like that kind of cleverness, and doing it that way does make for good repeat viewing, because you can go back and see where the clues were that you missed (like in The Sixth Sense). I dislike, though, when not only is the information hidden but the fact that there is information hidden is hidden. Of course, then, when you do see that coming because you have more lore than the average viewer, there's no surprise, so that twist didn't throw me at all, and that made the viewing experience... less than it could have been.<br /><br />Having said all of that, don't take it that I'm saying that it's a bad movie. It's not. It's a good movie, and I'm glad I saw it in the theater. The acting is good (Oldman is still great as Gordon, Hathaway was good, Gordon-Levitt is quite good), and the action and fight sequences are spectacular. But the movie, if you look beyond those things, is not great

B00AZNEW5G|4.0|I really had no preconceived notions about this movie when I went to see it other than I'd hoped I wouldn't be flushing $10 down the toilet. What surprised me was how quickly I got sucked into this story. A prisoner is going through only what I can describe as a rough interrogation. It became quickly evident that this movie was going to portray plenty of inhumane treatment and that the people conducting these interrogations would quickly adapt to methods that were not officially sanctioned by the U.S. government but apparently practiced by the CIA and other government agencies. Quickly propelled into these interrogatory sessions is a young security analyst named Maya. Portrayed by Jessica Chastin, Maya is smart and driven and has quite a mouth on her. Recruited straight out of high school into government service, she is a driven and dedicated woman who is seen as being obsessed with locating Osama Bin Laden's whereabouts. After 9/11, it seemed as though the entire non-Arab world was trying to figure out where he was. In reality, few credible leads surfaced regarding Bin Laden's whereabouts except for plenty dead ends. However, the security community was busy with other things such as foiling terrorist attacks on the home front and foreign soil. As the movie progresses, Maya and her co-workers work a lot on the emerging threats and Maya is portrayed as hunting down Bin Laden by herself in her spare time. I found it hard not to think of Maya as a tiny vigilante working alone to bring down the giant based on the way her character is developed. As the movie progresses, world events get in the way as do government assignments and changes in leadership, but Maya perseveres with little verifiable information for her trouble. Maya finds herself thrown in harms way on a few occasions as when she gets caught in riots or when the hotel she is dining at is blown up. In the process of watching this, the viewer finds that huge bribes are offered in exchange for information and gets a sense of how information is obtained without torture.<br />As Maya's leads begin to pay off, it becomes a waiting game regarding if and when the government plans to act. The information is circumstantial at best despite a large number of people on the ground covertly attempting to get significant information. Tension builds as the Navy Seals congregate at a desert outpost awaiting word to proceed with their daring attack which is tantalizing to the viewer but not completely explained before hand.<br />Quite a lot of the scenes that lead up to the Seal operation to apprehend Bin Laden are interesting and provides a groundwork  as to how the intelligence community works in tandem with the military. Obviously, the part of the movie that I found most interesting was the invasion of the Bin Laden complex as the Seals scoured the property for Bin Laden. It was tense and electrifying as they moved from room to room in pursuit of the prize.  It was so intricately planned and executed that I found myself sitting on the edge of my Visually, this entire segment was really well done and justified the Seals reputation.<br />Overall, I liked this movie. The story was told in a way that was easy to follow. The acting was good though it was clearly Jessica Chastain's trash mouth Maya who dominated this story. I thought she gave a strong performance as the tough young analyst and ultimately it was her character that drove the plot.<br />The things that I viewed as negatives? Other than it's slow pace at times, I wasn't exactly crazy about how torture was continually being advocated, but I found myself accepting it as a necessary evil while i watched this movie play out.  The story got a little heavy handed with the premise that it was only Maya that singlehandedly cornered Bin Laden. Realistically, many other people in the security network supported this project and planned for it.<br />I don't think this was the best picture I've seen this year, but it was a complex story thathad a big payoff, featured some of the best actors you've never heard of, and had a gritty realism that was decidedly not Hollywood.had a big payoff, featured some of the best actors you've never heard of, and had a gritty realism that was decidedly not Hollywood.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Reason for docking a star is the fairly common random crashing of the program. Ads can be somewhat annoying but it is free so not a huge issue. Overall great game.
B000H1RFKA|5.0|In my opinion this was both Robert Downey Jr's comeback movie (and still my favorite of his) as well as the last great thing to ever feature Val Kilmer.<br /><br />I won't go into the plot too much. I will tell you though that it is okay, not amazing, but sufficient to move things along. However, that doesn't stop this from being a great movie in my opinion since, much like Lethal Weapon, the characters and comedy are far more intertaining and well acted than most stories could match anyway.<br /><br />A bargain on Blu-Ray and should be in every collection.

B006LSZECO|1.0|Do yourself a favor and don't spend time on the laziest book ever written. Some novels take a few chapters to get completely sucked into the world of the book. I expect it, I'm not put off by that at all. With \\"Gone Girl\\" I kept waiting for that moment, but it never happened. Worse than that, the whole book seemed like a cop out. And the \\"twist\\"? Well, that was the sorriest excuse for a resolution. It's convoluted, it's confusing, and it's not worth the money.<br /><br />Get another book. Any other book. Even Harlequin novels have a more grappling storyline and less plot-holes than this book.

B00003CXPJ|5.0|This is just one of those movies, either you love it or hate it! And I just love goofy comedies. The story line is with the garment industries using male models to carry out assassinations of world leaders. Anyone who messes with the designers profits on a large scale better use caution. The outfits and hair styles are outrageous. Has some cameo appearances of celebrities, designers and models. The story is over the top, and hilarious! Great comedy!

B0028MBKVG|5.0|Born to Run was a joy to read. It  reads like a well written novel, while it covers intertwined personal and cultural histories as well as some aspects of human evolution,  all about how we are born to run. Most importantly, the  book has inspired me to rekindle my love of running.
0765325950|1.0|For a series that I had been reading since I was in like eighth grade, this novel was certainly the worst, despite that it should have been the best. Let's start with some glaringly obvious things.<br /><br />1)The battle scenes. Yes, it's the last battle. Yes, I want to know the main points of what happens during it. However, Sanderson just drags unimportant scenes out too much. If there was one thing about Jordan's battle scenes that sometimes irked me, it was that they were too short (such as the Seachan invasion of Ebou Dar). Sanderson, on the other hand, does the exact opposite.<br /><br />2)Logain. After Min's vision of glory, not to mention all the attention given to it, only a few pages are devoted to developing it. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't the manner of how he obtained glory that irritated me, it was that only a few pages were devoted to it. I mean, it was essentially \\"and people smiled at Logain\\" and nothing more.<br /><br />3) Elayne. After her idiocy for the last however many books, I expected something more grand to happen to her. But no, she is saved at the last minute and doesn't meet any consequences. Really, I would have much preferred that she die.<br /><br />4) Demondred (sp?). Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the idea of him conquering shara, but standing around and just sword fighting people? And not even doing it fairly? I could see if he fought Gwayn (sp?), Galad, and Lan without using the Power, but by doing so, that completely defeats the purpose of him engaging them in the first place. It seems to me, he would have just wiped them out right away without a thought of trying to fight them with a sword.<br /><br />5) All of the other main characters that are barely given any attention to. Seriously, where are the conclusions for like half of everyone?<br /><br />6) Mat. It seemed to me that he was thrown in as an afterthought in the battle. More of a \\"Oh yeah, we have this general that taveren (sp?). Maybe we should use him.\\" And where are the redarms?<br /><br />7) \\"Foodstuffs\\". When I saw this written as part of someone's dialogue, I couldn't help but cringe.<br /><br />8) And so on and so forth with the subpar writing.<br /><br />On a brighter note, I did enjoy the conclusion with Rand and the Dark One. However, his switching into Morridin's (sp?) body should have been given a better explanation, along with Alivia's (sp?) part of his death.<br /><br />Overall, I'd suggest reading it, but only to figure out the conclusion. I mean, typically with Jordan's novels, I get to a certain point and I just power through the novel because I'm interested in what's going on (even with his longer, drawn out mini plots). With this book, however, I finished it in about a week. I read through the first two hundred or so pages slowly because I was busy with school and didn't want to end up neglecting assignments and whatnot in case I got enveloped by the novel. Once the weekend hit, I hammered out the last of the book. But...I just didn't feel invested in it as I should have. The majority of it, I felt as though I was doing arduous academic reading rather than reading for fun and enjoyment. In other words, it was a task, rather than an activity.<br /><br />Oh, I did also enjoy the character of Androl. Not sure if he was Jordan's or Sanderson's idea, but either way, he was one of the few highlights in the book.

B001XULSG6|4.0|Star Trek series and movies have a positive, upbeat attitude about our future as a race.  Two BIG necessaries:  anti-matter power and Faster than light (FTL) technologies.  If humans have to develop these themselves, the timeline may be a bit stretched.  This movie shows one possible way that we join the space-faring races while having fun at it.

B008220DGE|5.0|Easily the best film of 2012. For those of you looking for the complacency of familiarity and the comfort of a conventional narrative, you will not find it here. For those of you who can't or won't keep an open mind, I suggest you turn away. The film is fragmentary, transient, impressionistic, beautifully photographed, powerfully acted, and masterfully directed (pun not intended). Paul Thomas Anderson proves himself once again to be one of the most promising directors working today -- and one of the most consistent in terms of quality, too. Not everyone will end up enjoying The Master, and many will accuse it of pointlessness and vapid meandering, but its emotional potency rewards the patient viewer and delivers an experience that, if nothing else, is wholly unique and endemic unto itself.

B0077ATSZE|5.0|I had a hard time getting in to this movie, but it was good.  I have a grandson that has Autism so I was glad I watched it.  It is very touching and really helped me understand that illness.  Good acting.  Parts of the movie were quite emotional but that happens.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I can't possibly add more to the almost 700 4 and 5 star reviews already posted about this book so I'll address a couple of the 2 star reviews that might put some people off of this book.<br /><br />At least one reviewer stated that he did not care for the author's excessive use of expletives.  Excessive is certainly a subjective term since I did not find Mr. Weir's language to be excessive at all (and like the reviewer I am also a Sailor...).  That being said, if an occasional F-Bomb here and there makes you turn red and feel like you need to scrub your eyeballs with a pumice stone while reciting 100 Hail Mary's then perhaps this book isn't for you.<br /><br />A few people did not like the journal entry format.  I can understand this but keep in mind that it is essential to the story.  The guy is stranded on Mars and wants his story to survive him...he knows his odds of survival are pretty slim despite the light he often makes to keep himself from giving up.  Stick with it past the 9% the one reviewer gave up at, the journal format does not follow all the way through.<br /><br />From a professional standpoint I can say that Mr. Weir's science and engineering is a bit off in some places of the story but this does not detract from the story at all.  Botany and Chemistry play key roles as well but I can't comment on these as about the only things I have ever been able to grow are hangnails...<br /><br />Bottom Line - The book is only $.99 for goodness sake.  If you like hard sci-fi you really owe it to yourself to at least give it a shot.

B00BB8SKPW|3.0|all the action is in the first 30 minutes. The rest of the movie is spent watching Denzel (who is great in it) drink like a fish. I can see how it could be a good story, but's soooo badly told. The whole heroine junkie whore character is out of left field and makes no sense, but the biggest disappointment is the end. A bunch of moralizing Hollywood hogwash. I'll say no more for the sake of those who haven't seen it.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I like all of Lee child's books.  This on was excellent and it was good from start to finish.  It was one of these books you can't put down.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is soo fun and addicting u should download it and it neva messes it uph and it is better than temple run 1 and 2
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy playing this game so much, I find it very challenging, I spend a hour playing each time I play, it keeps you thinking...
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This Book sis absolutely amazing from the<br />Begin to the end ! The ending was soo sad it made me cry a little. Cant wait for book two.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Jessica Lange is awesome in Season 1!<br />I watched Season 2 first and decided to check out Season 1....so glad I did!
1616550414|5.0|This version is a lot bigger and heavier than the Japanese version but once you go through it, it all becomes worth it. Definitely a something an LoZ fan should have.
B000JMKNV0|5.0|Another case where the book is ten times better than the movieThe movie changed the order in which things happened in the book the books sequence of events makes more sense than the movie
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Enjoyed Denzel in this &#34;fall from grace&#34; story of washed up pilot. CGI on airplane scenes were great. Not a 5 star but worth renting online
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is a pretty fun game to play, the only problem I have wit it is that the gems is very hard to earn but otherwise I love playing this game
0385535147|4.0|I have always enjoyed this genre and John Grisham, in particular. A good read. The twists and turns keep you turning pages.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Good game...just no way to shuffle tiles until the game allows<br />Still good for hours if fun<br />I enjoy playing as does my daughter
0316228532|4.0|My review isn't totally honest at this point because I've just begun reading it. Having never read any of the Potter series, I was interested in reading her first adult book.
B007SGM084|2.0|OMG. Enough sex for the most intrepid wanderer in porn.<br />It got pretty boring after awhile.  The plot, what there was of it would have made a novella and the epilogue went on forever.  A few laughs here and there.  Oh well, I finished it.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|Enjoyed the movie, lots of action, I love alien type movies and this was very good for the amount of alien interaction and the visual looks of the aliens. Having them looking similar to humans was nice.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|A delightful show that feels like you have been given an opportunity to observe what life was like back than.  Acting, locations and costumes are superb.  A guilty pleasure to view.
B007IUBU86|2.0|As a fan of Symphony X & Dream Theater, I expected so much more from Russell Allen and Mike Portnoy.  The songs are just plain boring.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Another wonderful book written by Nicholas Sparks.  He has a way of weaving the story, keeping you reading and enjoying every word!  I highly recommend this book!
B003L77GG0|5.0|What's to say.  It was a great series and it ended with a good finale.<br />Once you've invested in seasons 1-9, how can you live without the end....and I still like having the discs, not trusting that I'll be able to download the correct avi or mp4 or whatever comes next year without paying again.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I absolutely love the rovio franchise but when I bought this app, I found that it was not ad free. Every level has at least one ad that pops up and it gets annoying. Other than that, great game!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This historical fiction book begins pre-WWI and follows the events that lead into the war through the characters created by,  author Ken Follett as well as real people who are referenced through their contact with the characters.  It has everything:  intrigue, spies, diplomats, royalty, upper classes, lower classes, unions, overseers, owners, women's suffrage, violence, romance and sex.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is an easy upgrade from the more popular temple run and is much simpler with no tilting with the world tour extending across the globe its a great overall game
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|My family is very picky about shows we watch. I love this show except for the increasingly sexually suggestive behavior and scenes. It is fun and intelligent but my husband and I are ready to fast forward through the suggestive scenes. We had to skip probably 10 minutes of the show to shield our eyes and get back to the real story line. I like it but be ready to fast forward if you do not want to let yourself commit adultry in your heart.
B001EQ5ZJK|5.0|An excellent example of converting a scientific material into laymans language. The book was inspiring, informative and I have recommended it to 6 people.
B008TMA1LY|3.0|There's no way to earn the little heart coins you need to buy more characters.  How are broke people ever supposed to gain the characters you need to get good at this game?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is a great app and very fun for my brother. I play on it offten when there is nothing to do.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game subway. Surfer is a good but yet challenging game. I love this game because it challenges me to beat my opponents off of facebook in which I want to beat everyday and inspire to play.
B006GHA9QQ|4.0|Wish that Andrew L. Webber had checked his dates.  The timing just doesn't jive between Phantom and the sequel.  However wonderful score with suprise ending.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|After seeing the movie I HAD to have the sound track.  Fantastic job and fantatstic music. Can't stop listening to it.
B0093FNZT6|5.0|If curiosity about what exists after death haunts or piques the imagination, Dr Alexander's personal journey into the afterlife may well answer some questions if not present a worthy challenge to accepted beliefs.  Whether one is religious or not, the experience of neurosurgeon Eben Alexander, demonstrates there are some definitions of brain-death that are not clear cut.<br />  Dr. Alexander tries to define the gateways of death in scientific terms and he is convinced his experience took him to another sphere, a reality that did not match the customary description of a christian heaven but certainly had the all consuming sense of peace and acceptance that many religions grant exists in an afterlife.<br />  It goes without saying that his survival of this near death experience changed his life.  Dr Alexander doesn't claim to have all the answers, however.  He concedes there are many people who have different experiences.  His personal journey is offered as another glimpse through the fog that surrounds the question where do we go when we die?<br />  Whether or not the reader agrees with all of Dr Alexander's conclusions is not important.  That this story was shared gives opportunity for deeper consideration that each of us can give the concepts.
0345803485|1.0|Awful book. It lacks of creativity. The characters lack of developing and emotional intelligence. I would have liked this book 20 years ago when I was an impressionable teen.
B003G8Y4QO|2.0|Dr Who used to be good and I greatly enjoyed it but it has begun to be nothing but a platform for pushing &#34;alternative lifestyles.&#34;  Do not misunderstand me.  I do NOT have &#34;something agianst gays.&#34;  I am just not gay and I get rather tired of a show which, more and more seems to be nothing but an, &#34;in your face&#34; advertisement for &#34;gay is ok.&#34;<br />It is supposedd to be entertainment, not propoganda.
1401322786|5.0|Have passed the book onto friends, couldn't put it down. Had some good lessons on life. Recommend it to others
0425252868|5.0|I had heard of this story before.  As a matter of fact There is painting at the Tumwater, WA aviation museum which is signed by both pilots.  It is good to get the whole story behind the painting
B004LZFWJO|5.0|This little game can be played for hours.  It's colorful and allows you to anticipate your next move.  Any age group can enjoy it.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|I was hooked from the first show and was glad I had purchased the season so I could keep going.  Looking forward to season two.  Very gripping, clues are there but well done by all of the characters.
B008133MDK|5.0|The BBC's Sherlock is easily the best retelling in film of the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's short stories.  Better than the recent movies, better than &#34;Elementary,&#34; better than all older attempts (although I'm sure the film nostalgic types would probably disagree).  Season  2 is just as good as Season 1, and if wasn't for the hounds of baskerville episode, which is in my opinion the weakest episode of Sherlock from both seasons, it would stand out as more entertaining.<br /><br />The show is just melodramatic enough to emulate Doyle's writing.  The criminals are a bit too villainous, the crime scenes a bit too gruesome, the characters a bit too hyperbolic, to be taken as &#34;true-to-life&#34; storytelling. This is just in line with the rogues gallery of Holmes books, and of course it makes the episodes that much more entertaining.  Cumberbatch does a fantastic job of playing a flawed genius.  Freeman is just right for Watson.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|What can I say about this most fantastic tale?  It's so well written....it transports you to wherever Yann Martel wants to take you.  I loved this story.  I love the tone of it.....I could almost hear Pi telling me the story.  The movie was wonderful, but I'm glad I saw it before I read the book or I would have been waiting for things that just didn't make it into the flick, as good as it was, it's not nearly the amazing adventure the book is.  Excellent.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|The movie came on time and it was sealed in the original packaging. The movie itself is excellent and everyone should watch it.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|The whole movie seemed like it was lacking something. A lot of things in place but still seemed that something was missing. Could be the weak plot (the initial scene seemed pretty weak, for example), absence of a &#34;Bond girl&#34;, very weak Bardem's character. movie is worth watching only for die hard Bond fans. The previous one, even though criticized heavily, was much better, but the best of the Craig's Bond movies is undeniably &#34;Casino Royale&#34;.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|The movie provides a good narrative of the events and you will know what happened to many minor details. Affleck attempted to recreate everything true to the facts. That would be great for a documentary, but for an action movie (or thriller) the main point is to move the audience through the magic of filmmaking. It is severely lacking on the thriller or action movie part. Affleck is a terrific director but his Boston-based movies are much better and actually touch hearts (and have more action than Argo).
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is probably my most used app. It works great for rigging notes at school or in meetings, or for a grocery list. Great app.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I absolutely love the series and cannot wait for the next book. This book did not disappoint if you loved Bared to You. I am very very excited for the next book out 06/04/13
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is so addictive and no one I know can resist subway surfer. You're. Crazy not to get this app
B00006JJ1O|5.0|Always wanted to get their cds when they first came out but I was never able to. I have 3 so far and I am loving every song from them, not to mention Russian is one of my favorite languages as well. Cd made it in perfect condition and shipping was pretty fast.
B000092WD8|1.0|Not the actual movie, its great!  The DVD that was sent did not play in my DVD player, which does not seem to have any issues with my other DVDs.  Ended up sticking it in the laptop, and my CD/DVD player was able to read it there.  However, watching the DVD with my daughter on the laptop was not the family night I had hoped for.  I just won't buy from that retailer again.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Laugh, tear up, respect and appreciate! Thanks Kyle and Taya for such a good book and sharing you life! Chris will be missed!!
B008OJ291W|5.0|Great tunes from a great band. Well produced. Sound quality excellent. If you like ELO & Jeff Lynn it's a must.
B005H5H3LW|2.0|StarBlazers and Robotech are my 2 favorite cartoons of all time, I remember running home after school to make sure I didn't miss StarBlazers.<br /><br />unfortunately Space BattleShip Yamato is another opportunity to make an epic movie wasted.<br /><br />Gamalons are omnipotent until the script doesn't want it, humanity is outclassed in every way until the script doesn't want it, broken tone, no credibility, a very slow pace with huge drawn out monologues doesn't help.<br /><br />to be clear their is a lot to like in this movie, bridge set design is great, the wave motion gun was every bit as epic as I remembered it, I liked that the story worked hard at acknowledging the enormity of the task, music is great but then it's all let down by a monumentally slow pace, the apparent reality that the entire Gamalon fleet can be taken out by a smattering of black tiger fighters.... really?... should have sent those sooner.  the Yamato's guns are the only guns that actually work?.... should have equipped those on the warships they sent to Mars, the Analyzer robot can take out 1000's of gamalons at a time, should have made 2 or 3, why are the Gamalons allergic to firing on Yamato, why would Gamalons only have 1 stealth warship, why, why, why, why.... bother?<br /><br />what could have been better isn't... it's not horrible but it's not good either and while it might sort of almost be worth the time to watch it's definitely not worth paying money for.<br /><br />here's an idea gift wrapped 40 years ago by the series for the movie, use the onboard manufacturing they mentioned in the series to replenish lost fighters and for fixing damage so they can lose some, so Yamato can take some, then mention that a considerable number of crew are being held in stasis to be woken as required, then require it.
B0009X7664|2.0|My rating reflects the product (NOT the movie). This is an amazing story.  I use the video to assist teaching students who struggle to read independently.  The text is very hard, so using the video to activate their thinking is a helpful strategy.  When I first played the DVD (Which was brand new), I was getting &#34;skipping over damaged area&#34; messages repeatedly.  I'm trying to make it work.  Might have been a fluke.
030758836X|3.0|Overall fine, nothing special.  Good beach reading.  Not sure I would recommend it, but it went quickly.  Like others, not sure how I feel about the ending.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|Music just sounds better, to put it simply! I recently purchased the Audio Technica ATH-M50s, and they sound FANTASTIC with this amp plugged in versus standalone. The blue light setting amplifies the midrange and a bit of the low end as well. Great, great product!
B005USZML4|5.0|Fast paced story that kept me reading.  The main character is a 13 year old budding attorney.  Soon I forgot his age and was totally engrossed in the story.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|The Downton Abbey saga continues, this time with Shirley MacClaine as the American mother-in-law, Cora's mother, who pops in to make her presence known in Downton Abbey. Maggie Smith is wonderful as always. And the cast is always superb.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|Love the condition the DVD came in. Loved the movie and the quality of the used DVD. I am happy with the product.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|Loved the movie when it came out. Found a DVD in a good price, almost bought a new one at the store. But I am happy with the used one.
B005CRQ2IU|5.0|Great way to get a book I am reading for class and on the same day I was very impressed by the quality as well.
B0052RDHTM|3.0|Though I am loathe, I have to admit that I enjoyed this book. The author does a wonderful job of inserting factual historical information into the narrative, and the plot moves along seamlessly.. However, there is a major fault the discerning reader must face: Fall of Giants is full of preposterous coincidences.The first part of the book introduces the characters, who are all well-drawn though with a tendency to stereotype. Later on, the protagonists repeatedly run into one another in situations that defy logic. Examples: A Scot and a German meet again on a WWI battlefield; a Russian peasant who emigrates to the US runs into a Russian princess from the family that had hanged his father. One tries to suspend belief, but it's difficult. It also doesn't help that the protagonists are all posed as major agents in every important world event of the period.<br /><br />Reading this book was like drinking good whiskey; you gag, but you enjoy the experience.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Whenever I choose a book by David Baldacci, I am not disappointed.  There's always enough action to keep me turning pages and ignoring the bedtime hour.  Zero Day did that for me again. I'm hoping CID Special Agent Puller will become part of a new series of government intrigue novels.  Please don't let me down.  I'm not ready to get a full night's sleep yet!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|easy transaction - discs in great condition - wonderful series - well worth the low price - will purchase series 4 from same place
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Enjoyable. Definitely a real aspect to this story when it comes  to not wanting to feel love by  the  ending gives hope to readers an  overall was a good read here  the plot find wait til the very end  to develop like most romance  novels!
B00992CF6W|5.0|.Mine Craft is awesome because you get to build giant storie houses.So think of it mine craft is mineing blocks.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Good Book! Can't wait to read the last one! Hope it ends the way I want, if not I will be disappointed!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This was an awesome book  and I loved it I'm glad it was free or I would not of gotten this awesome book
B009A3NGF4|5.0|This was a nice addition to my audio collection.  And at a great reduced price for a trending band. I love the energy in their music.
0307960471|5.0|I have read every Harry Hole novel, and as another reader mentioned, I strongly suggest that you read the previous ones first in order to fully experience this amazing book.  Despite the fact that the books are quite dark and more violent that I usually prefer, I was immediately drawn to this series because of Jo Nesbo's intricate plots -- so convoluted and so satisfying.  Excellent plotting seems to have become a lost art, but with Nesbo, everything fits.  Even the smallest detail, a whiskey bottle or a nylon cord, has a critical role to play.<br /><br />I just finished an hour ago, and I am totally shaken.  This book is so much more than merely an exciting read (although it is certainly that!).  It has left me pondering the age-old questions of who we are and why we seem incapable of escaping our fates.
0345529057|4.0|First 2 books were fantastic.  Third book started to drag a bit and fourth book pace ground to a halt.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|It took a little practice, but once I got the hang of it,my typing speed at least doubled. I've had no problems with the software, and I either got more proficient using it or it better learned my style of writing. I had used Swipe in the past, but, for me, this app is better.
0375851569|5.0|Our daughter really enjoys these stories.  This collection is a really good set. What more can I say about it.
0765325950|5.0|This was a wonderful final volume to the Wheel of Time.  While I suspect that it would have been better had Robert Jordan lived to complete it, I also suspect that it would have been even longer!
1898929246|5.0|This sturdy booklet covers 30-some square miles (about 100 square kilometers) of Central London -- from Kensington Palace on the west to the Tower of London on the east, and from the London Zoo on the north to National Army Museum on the south.  An older edition was so useful on our last trip to London that I plan to buy the new edition for our upcoming trip.<br /><br />The booklet format fits easily into a purse or coat pocket, and is far easier to reference on a windy street corner than a fold-out map would be.
B009I2UH2W|5.0|Bought this for my iPhone 5.  Works just fine and can be used with an Otter Box case in place.  It does fit pretty tight in the car outlet, but after a couple of uses, there is no problem.  Really pleased and would recommend.
B00687PWQG|5.0|I'm taking History 101 in college and 'dreaded' the class. Luckily my professor is interesting and one class period we watched this episode. Tired and in a sardine forum room - I did not gleam much from the 'in-class' showing so I purchased it (we had to write a paper about it).<br />The acting is phenomenal and I feel like purchasing the entire series. I understand why it won so many awards and MOST importantly I had a better understanding of the historical context than had been gleamed from the textbook readings.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Super hd great movie I love it , amazon is the easiest way to rent movies , I'd recommend this ton everyone .
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|Methods such as \\"Agile\\", \\"Lean\\", \\"Continuous Delivery\\", etc. are transformational on their own, but only after reading this book did I truly understand how they could be used together to generate exponential increases in business value. Now this book is just a novel, so I do not have any illusions that a company like \\"Parts Unlimited\\" could resolve all it's issues in such a short time, but it does make a strong case for why IT Management is not so special that it can't be managed efficiently.<br /><br />The book uses a fictional company to convey the value of applying time tested management practices to solve age old IT challenges. It is a truly entertaining story based on a fictional company \\"Parts Unlimited\\" that has made more mistakes than any real company ever could, so you will both sympathize with their challenges and get some satisfaction that other organizations have greater challenges than yours. For those of you have read \\"The Goal\\", you will be pleasantly pleased to hear that the authors modeled this book after that classic novel.<br /><br />About the Movement<br /><br />I began following the IT Revolution Press, and the thought leaders that are behind it, as part of my research on topics such as DevOps and Continuous Delivery.<br /><br />This book is part of a march larger movement by the \\"IT Revolution Press\\" who aims to \\"positively influence the lives of 1 million IT people over the next 5 years\\" by \\"uniting thought leaders in all the relevant domains with a common sense of purpose and passion to help us achieve our goal and improve IT for generations to come\\".<br /><br />Here are some of their major milestones:<br />- Their movement started in 2012 with the publishing of a manifesto outlining current economic and human costs associated with inefficient management of IT within companies from all industries, and how they plan to affect change in these organizations.<br /><br />- They published this book \\"The Phoenix Project: A Novel About IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win\\" in January 2013.<br /><br />- An extended group of authors are currently developing the follow on book \\"The DevOps Cookbook\\" that \\"aims to \\"catalog and codify the practices of high performing DevOps organizations that result in extraordinary performance. Our goal is to create a prescriptive playbook that organizations can follow to replicate the extraordinary culture and outcomes enabling IT Operations to operate at scale and win in the marketplace.\\"
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game its very fun and it gets you to the point where you don't want to stop playing you just Want to keep going  till you can get the character you want or the board.
1477467041|1.0|While the ideas set forth are compelling, the grammatical, punctuation and spelling errors make this edition the worst thing in print that I have seen in a long time.  The publisher should be embarrassed to sell this booklet.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game lets you feel like you own a horse<br />it shows you the responsibility  and expenses of having a horse and is a good experiance
B00942V1J4|5.0|a wonderful love story of a different kind.... nice story line ! had the perfect actor and actresses for the movie.love happy endings.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I thought that this book was exceptional! Susan did a fabulous job on describing the characters and scenes! I read all three books very quickly and was completely entertained throughout the whole bool series.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Seriously, the grammar alone is pathetic!!!! How is she the number one best author???? - REAL DEAL - Stephen King says. LOL... I just don't get it -- other writers work so hard to catch grammar mistakes, and this author comes along with the worst grammar, editing, run on sentences, as such, and ppl are raving. It BEATS me! How can anyone complain about &#34;editing, commas, etc....IF THIS IS THE BAR THAT GILLIAN HAS SET for the # 1 book....Amazon needs to stop the review system. Struggling authors get one review about a simple typo and their sells -- crash..this book has almost every comma misplaced...sentences that would make a English teacher cut her wrist....I found thousand of sentences in this book that are half the page!!! REALLY? Please, Gillian, you are a great storyteller -- but study sentence structure!! Thanks!! Comments welcome...someone else surely must feel the same way I do....
B007SGLZP8|5.0|No disappointments here. I enjoy all of Grishams work. This book is right in step with his prior work. Good stuff.
B009R5GR1K|2.0|Can't see the benefit of this version over the free one. Thesaurus is disappointing to say the least. No latin translation.
B0060MYM7O|1.0|I would advise anyone considering purchasing this fine series to avoid the blu ray editions.  Save yourself some money and a boatload of frustration by going with the dvd versions instead.  The older blu ray software (powerdvd) on my home theater pc will not play these disks without purchasing an upgrade to the software which costs more than the disks themselves.  This is extremely frustrating to say the least and has led me to conclude that these will be the last blu ray disks that I will ever purchase.  Just as a point of information, there are hundreds of FREE Game of Thrones torrents floating around the internet.  None of these copies are crippled with the drm that prevents me from watching my legally purchased version.  Must I employ questionably legal actions to view the material that I legitimately obtained?  Somehow, I feel like a victim of a scam.
B00B2QA2F4|5.0|Excellent, full of action and entertaining, even funny at times, I enjoyed it and would recommend it as<br />a watch it again movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My grandsons love playing this on my kindle fire. I tried it but I am not as quick as they are but it was still fun.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I did not like it at first until I Got the rhythm of the acting with the music. It is defiantly not like the Musical but the passion and story is even stronger than I have ever felt it to be. It is a negatively based story but an awesome  story none the less. The Good Guys, the bad guys, they all win, they all lose, and life goes on.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|cute and enjoyable. simple and the minigames are fun. wish some of the cooldowns weren't so long like the balloon game.

B000001E7T|4.0|For people who are new to PJ Harvey, she is an incredibly hard artist to classify. On \\"To Bring You My Love\\", she brings an album that like I said in the title of my review is incredibly dark and at times you can feel torture/yearning in her voice. PJ Harvey is known for experimentation and she brings it here but also at the same time presents straightforward ballads or just rocking songs (with her unique brand of eclectic instrumentation or sound).<br /><br />This album was hard for me to fully appreciate at first; when I first gave it a listen, I thought that it should've been whittled down to an EP or something. After 3 listens, I finally began to understand how the songs complimented each other as a whole and picked up/enjoyed things I had missed before. My favorites would have to be: \\"C'mon Billy\\", \\"Long Snake Moan\\", \\"Down By the Water\\", \\"Send His Love to Me\\", and \\"Teclo\\".<br /><br />The most experimental songs that might be hard to appreciate for most mainstream listeners would probably be \\"Working For the Man\\" and \\"I Think I'm a Mother\\" due to the fact that in the first song I mentioned, she practically whispers and sings at the same time except for the chorus. The second song I mentioned has a very lo-fi quality to it and again, her vocals aren't as audible.<br /><br />The reason I gave this album 4 stars is that even though there are some incredible songs on here, a couple of them just don't fully come together; they're decent but had a lot more potential. For the most part though, this is one of the most emotional and soul wrenching albums I've heard in a while with great, raw musicianship.<br /><br />For people who are familiar with PJ Harvey, you know probably know this is a really good album already and if you don't own this, you should pick it up.<br /><br />For people new to PJ Harvey, I would say listen to some of the song samples off the album to see if you enjoy the music. If I had to describe Polly Jean Harvey, I'd say she's a hybrid of Bjork and Beck with a much darker edge and a much more raw approach.Beck with a much darker edge and a much more raw approach.
B00AZL3PBK|3.0|This game is fun but it has problems on last level where it wont let you climb the wall.  Its impossinle to finish the game.  If you played LEP 1 you will find it easy.  But its free so no big loss...just no satisfaction when beating the game
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Great game, easy to play and it makes you lose track of time. I recommend it to everybody that likes hidden object games
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I reviewed season three first, but five stars for season two for all the same reasons. Excellent writing, directing, and Maggie Smith is a gem. A must-watch for everyone!
0060594896|2.0|Let me start by saying I'm a fan of the self-help genre: what could be more noble than trying to help others help themselves? Writers like Dale Carnegie and Norman Vincent Peale are my idols. For this reason, I should have been predisposed to enjoy Jack Canfield's _The Success Principles_, right? Well, the expectation turned out to be unfounded: I consider this heavy tome a failure.<br /><br />There is a saying in my native language that goes like this: \\"Self-praise stinks.\\" Oh my, if that saying is true... then this book stinks all the way to heaven! The book is extremely long (artificially so), but on what seems like every second page, Jack Canfield congratulates himself on his monumental worldly achievements, his fabulous career, his immense wealth, and so on.<br /><br />The self-praise, overblown out of all proportion, is not limited to Jack Canfield himself. Here is how the book's co-author, Janet Switzer, is described in the \\"About the Authors\\" section:<br /><br />&lt;&lt; Today, she's the marketing genius and business growth expert of choice for some of the world's top success gurus [...]. Additionally, Janet has counseled more than 50,000 companies and entrepreneurs worldwide in leveraging their intangibles and information assets for untold millions in potential windfall revenue. [...] She regularly speaks to thousands of entrepreneurs, independent sales professionals, corporate employees, and industry association members on the principles of success and income generation. Additionally, she helps achievers who are experts in their field attain worldwide status and million-dollar incomes by building publishing empires around their business strategies, training concepts, industry expertise, and unique market posture. >><br /><br />Erm, exaggerate much? Are we reading a book here, a work of literature, or some advertisement, a promotional leaflet perhaps? And it's not just the \\"About the Authors\\" section that makes you feel as if you were reading an advertisement produced by a corporate PR/marketing department -- you can't quite get rid of the feeling *throughout* the book. You get the idea: it's all about the many dozens, hundreds, thousands, and yes, \\"untold millions\\". Reading a passage like the above may be good for a laugh if you just read it *once or twice* -- but if the book contains very similar statements on practically every page, this gets tiresome soon.<br /><br />It's not just the ceaseless self-praise that is repulsive about the book. The focus the book places on materialism is astounding. I agree that this is only the superficial impression, and that Jack Canfield does imply there are other values in life as well. However, those subtler undertones get completely drowned out in the odes Canfield tirelessly sings on material riches throughout the book. And here is the quote by Wallace D. Wattles, chosen by Canfield to introduce Chapter 60, that nicely sums up what's wrong about the overall tone of _The Success Principles_:<br /><br />&lt;&lt; Whatever may be said in praise of poverty, the fact remains that it is not possible to live a really complete or successful life unless one is rich. >><br /><br />Oh, really? Well, it's definitely Mr. Wattles's and Mr. Canfield's prerogative to believe this -- but to those readers who believe otherwise, reading this book will be a struggle. By the way, I wonder what a certain figure named Jesus Christ would have thought of the above statement -- one only needs to recall his (mistranslated) \\"camel and eye of the needle\\" metaphor (Mt 19:24). Here is another sample:<br /><br />&lt;&lt; Multimillionaire Dr. John Demartini is a resounding success by anyone's standards. He's married to a beautiful and brilliant woman -- Athena Starwoman, the world-famous astrologer who consults and writes for 24 well-known magazines, including  Vogue. Together, they own several homes in Australia. And they spend over 60 days a year together circumnavigating the globe in their $3 million luxuryapartment onboard the $550 million ocean liner World of ResidenSea -- a residence they purchased after selling their Trump Tower apartment in New York City. >> (chapter 15)<br /><br />If that doesn't elicit a guffaw from you, I don't know what will. In fact, there are so many silly passages in the book resembling the one just quoted, that you sometimes feel the book should perhaps be sold with a warning label or sticker on it, \\"Do not open if your IQ is in three digits\\".<br /><br />The \\"Acknowledgments\\" section of _The Success Principles_ implies that a great many people were involved in the production of the book: proofreading it, suggesting improvements, and so on. In light of this, it is surprising how the book appears to be so weak structurally. A clear, systematic, internal organization of ideas seems to be missing, despite the 6 sections and 64 chapters -- reading the book felt more like, \\"anything goes\\", and \\"let's throw this in as well\\". The book definitely seems overlong; you feel as if much of it could be cut; the text sometimes gives you the impression of just being an unending series of anecdotes, with a few homespun pearls of wisdom thrown in here and there. The book lacks depth, and seems comfortable with sliding on the surface most of the time.<br /><br />The authors' intention apparently was to write in an as easy-to-understand way as possible -- in this, they definitely succeeded. However, there are two ways of writing simply (which is a commendable goal): discussing complex matters in an easy-to-understand way, without neglecting any complexities underneath; or just write in an easy-to-understand way, *ignoring* the complexities underneath. Unfortunately, _The Success Principles_ falls into the second category.<br /><br />It is surprising to see so many 5-star reviews of the book here on Amazon. It's not just surprising, but suspicious. Most of the 5-star reviews seem confined to a few brief, general sentences of praise that *anyone* could have said even *without* reading the book; there seems to be no *personally felt* connection between the reviewer and how the book affected him/her. You also get a weird feeling while reading the many endorsements of _The Success Principles_ printed right inside the book. Again, the personal connection between the book and the quoted person, praising the book so effusively, seems to be absent. You get the impression as if the endorsements originated more in the way of, \\"Hey, buddy, can you please endorse my new book? I'll make sure to endorse yours the next time around.\\"<br /><br />Why, then, 2 stars for _The Success Principles_, instead of just 1? Because reading it is not a complete waste of time. The book does contain important insights, many good anecdotes, and lots of impressive quotes. The quotations are more impressive, in fact, than the main text of the book. Here is a sample of a nice anecdote, from chapter 16:<br /><br />&lt;&lt; Legendary violinist Isaac Stern was once confronted by a middle-aged woman after a concert. She gushed, \\"Oh, I'd give my life to play like you!\\"  \\"Lady,\\" said Stern acidly, \\"that I did!\\" >><br /><br />And here are a couple of impressive passages written by Canfield himself:<br /><br />&lt;&lt; When you perform any task in real life, researchers have found, your brain uses the same identical processes it would use if you were only vividly visualizing that activity. In other words, your brain sees no difference whatsoever between visualizing something and actually doing it. >> (chapter 11)<br /><br />&lt;&lt; I've had people in my seminars who, when they finally *truly* forgive someone, release long-term migraine headaches within minutes, find immediate relief from chronic constipation and colitis, release their arthritis pain, improve their eyesight, and immediately experience a host of other physical benefits. One man actually lost 6 pounds in the following 2 days without changing his eating habits! I have also seen people subsequently create miracles in their careers and financial lives. Believe me, it is definitely worth the effort. >> (chapter 29)<br /><br />The thing I liked most about _The Success Principles_ were the many delightful quotations interspersed throughout the text. Here are a few of them to give you a foretaste:<br /><br />&lt;&lt; If you can't, you must, and if you must, you can. >> (Anthony Robbins, in chapter 15)<br /><br />&lt;&lt; You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with. >> (Jim Rohn, in chapter 25)<br /><br />&lt;&lt; You are a living magnet. What you attract into your life is in harmony with your dominant thoughts. >> (Brian Tracy, in chapter 26)<br /><br />&lt;&lt; You must begin to understand, therefore, that the present state of your bank account, your sales, your health, your social life, your position at work, etc., is nothing more than the physical manifestation of your previous thinking. If you sincerely wish to change or improve your results in the physical world, you must change your thoughts, and you must change them IMMEDIATELY. >> (Bob Proctor, in chapter 56)<br /><br />&lt;&lt; Too many people spend money they haven't earned, to buy things they don't want, to impress people they don't like. >> (Will Rogers, motto of chapter 59)<br /><br />&lt;&lt; It is one of the beautiful compensations of this life that no man can sincerely try to help another without helping himself. >> (Ralph Waldo Emerson, motto of chapter 62)d even *without* reading the book; there seems to be no *personally felt* connection between the reviewer and how the book affected him/her.

B004D0YB5S|1.0|The main reason for my low rating is no because of the album it self, but what showed up was the instrumental version of this album. Very disappointing to open your package that you've been waiting to be \\"back in stock\\" for it to be the wrong one. I own a digital copy of the vocal album but really wanted it on vinyl. I'm extremely reluctant to re-order this through amazon.<br />...Update...<br />Even greater disappointment to discover the wrong vinyl sent was also warped. What a shame.
B005HSL626|5.0|So addicting couldn't stop playing!When ever my friends go on they play for the next hour! Should totally be rated five star! Everyone should get this app in my opinion!
0451232852|4.0|First: I enjoyed this via Audible so I didn't \\"read\\" it so much as I listened to it. Second: I started the novel *expecting* to like it because I'm already a Follett fan.  Third: I enjoy historical nonfiction very much, so this is close to my wheelhouse... if you aren't fascinated by history, you may not enjoy this.<br /><br />The basic story here is the leading up to, and the time during World War I. The characters represent German, British, Russian, and American cultures. The plot touches on love and loss, sexual choices, womens' liberation, freedom of speech, corruption and loyalty. There are a few cliches (the demanding father) and a few turns that I didn't see coming.<br /><br />What I particularly *loved* about this novel was how the characters were all different - age, class, and culture. I loved feeling the story from multiple perspectives and it actually helped shed some light on things I hadn't considered before.<br /><br />This was long and short at the same time.  It was a long novel but it ended somewhat abruptly, and a little too tidy for my personal taste. I understand that is a set up for the next in the trilogy, but it was distracting in a way, and I wasn't totally satisfied upon the book's conclusion.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this story, and I recommend it to either Follett fans, historical nonfiction or fiction fans. I can't give it 5 stars because I didn't rush out to get the second book as soon as I was done (though it was available at the time of my reading).  All in all: a great, solid read... but not a new favorite.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|When this app first came out, I was excited and rushed to get it. It's a lot cooler than temple run and it's free. I mean, how many apps this awesome are free? I loved it and played it a lot. But then about a three weeks after I got it, it stopped working. I tried to open it and it went to the Imangi studios screen. It stayed there for about 30 seconds and I thought it was loading. Then the screen went blank and it went back to the home screen. I tried multiple times to open it and this happened every time. I waited a few days, tried to open it, and the same thing happened. Maybe there is a glitch in the K Fire version, or is everyone having this problem? Or is it just me?

B00A9X9TIW|2.0|The part of the movie I saw was alright, but I fell asleep because it just wasn't all that great.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Game is pretty sweet I have it on my iphone but on my kindle it is very laggy you die a bunch she to the lag. And its hard to get coins to buy anything
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|If you like teenage slapstick, this movie is for you.  Also, teddy bears and old men do not sit around and do the same things that these two do together.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Wonderful show, can't wait for this week show, very good and would love to see this show go on for a few more years.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|There is much food for thought in this book for those who aren't quite sure about the possibility of an &#34;afterlife&#34;
B00A2BTCM4|4.0|I am a huge Rush fan and this cd has been enhanced to perfection. Any true Rush geek like myself must upgrade their regular copy of 2112.  Please check out some of my songs on the MichaelJamesDavis Music Channel. I have been a Rush fan for over 30 years. The DVD that comes with this package is the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars. It is quite lame to say the least .
B00785P2QC|4.0|Fun and fast moving. It is also like a real economy. It hard if you do not want to spend any real money in the game.
B001GCUER0|5.0|Even better than the first season, this show is so powerful and dramatic.  The whole house watches it together now.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I have always been a fan of Lincoln and Child. Their Pendergast stories are always so intriguing and unexpected and leave me wanting more. This is no exception. Well written always with the anticipation so much more in the future. Very enjoyable.
B000V86OKG|5.0|Possibly the best season of this show, every season I think of getting showtime just to be able to watch the next one faster.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|The movie was great, and now the Angrybirds freeing all the friends by crashing into the bird cages is all sorts of fun!! It is interesting to find all the hidden objects and awards!!
078322611X|5.0|This film was practically an institution in my house growing up.  It still makes me cry when I watch it now.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Game of spacial orentation and strategy. Lots of fun and gets progressively more difficult.  This is a free game, but clues  must be bought after you use your ,3 free ones. Also to gain access to some of the game a purchase is required.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|I'm still in love with this show and Dexter's crazy antics, don't care about how unrealistic this whole scenario is.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game and so does my sisters. We play it every night before bed. It is really good if your looking for a game like Temple Run but a little bit more childish. I recommend the game for 5 - 15 years. Enjoy! :) :D
B000YABIQ6|5.0|I love this show so much that I give seasons of it to people at Christmas.  The whole family watches it together now.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Alot of this was Neurosurgeon talk, a bit hard to understand. I did enjoy it and will tell  friends they hould read it.
B000M5B6Q0|5.0|I didn't see this movie when it came out because I honestly expected it to be another lame rom-com.  But a friend told me how much she loved and made me watch it one night and I loved it too! The main highlight is the amazing soundtrack; I couldn't get the songs out of my head!
0525953728|4.0|I bought this for my husband and I hope to read it soon.  He said it is an excellent book.

B005GFPZYK|4.0|What a great book and a revealing look into the mind of a great warrior this County has produced to defend our great nation.
B0017I1IZA|4.0|Hard Eight is my personal favorite in the series this far. I can agree, Stephanies incompetent antics get a bit old, and was relieved to find she developed some chutzpah! The story line remained fast paced through out, and was well seasoned with the trademark hilarity. The villain in this one was also more gritty and dark, with an eye for terrorizing our crazy gal. The smoldering romance triangle gained much needed ground. I'm really looking forward to reading the next one. Woo hoo!
159420411X|5.0|If you do statistics or data mining, this book is for you.  It is basically about qualifying your data for making predictions.  Well written and pervasive in examples.  Touches on many areas of interest.
B007K3JCAE|5.0|Love the visual effects and always a huge fan of the level of intelligence and investigation that goes into a Sherlock Holmes story.  Although loosely based on the books/stories, fun to see the little elements that were included.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|The author's writing present an interesting diversion to some of my other reading selections which might lean toward historical material.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Great movie. Always love Denzel in most of his movies. Great ending that demonstrated the integrity needed throughout our nation.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Buy it now or else a roving pack of rabid badgers will maul your ears off and you'll never listen to anything again.

B00003CXBK|5.0|loved it so so so much i plan on getting more of hayao miyazaki's moves i really enjoy his work have scene i was little
0446554995|1.0|I was so angry when I finished this book. What a waste of time. Too many different stories going on that had no relevance. It broke up the main Pendergast story line way too much. I am not going over the details of the book because so many have already done that. It was just so disjointed and unbelievable that I just wished he would die and end the series. The big battle of twins was so beyond ridiculous, look at each other, you are brothers and sisters and don't really want to kill each other. Pick up your pitch forks and brooms and whatever thing is lying around and revolt!! HA Ha, silly. Not exactly like that, but really close to what that battle was like. Cory, what in the world was that story in the book for? Other than to perhaps start a new series later, great, but don't put her in this book because it was a waste of space! Constance, and the doctor? Again, why in this book, save it. Other than trying to tie these far fetched stories together, which was just to far out there to make it interesting. Nope I am done with this series for good.
B004HW7JH4|4.0|5th time/season same high level. Unfortunatelly more and more political correctness issues. Lack of that aspect was a strong side of this series.
B004HD61KE|4.0|I like the &#34;cheaper&#34; kindle books and this one gave me plenty of bang for my buck. It will keep you turning the pages. Had a little trouble keeping track of all the characters initially but they are all necessary to the outcome of the story. A good read.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Love this series!!  Nothing like it on TV.  Kings, Queens, Dragons & frozen zombies!<br />Too much good stuff to mention.  Everyone trying to out-scheme everyone.  Delicious<br />mischief.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It's fun when I have nothing to do at the Dr. Office waiting for my visit, I'm glad I downloaded it.
B004DM0UII|5.0|This is an easy program to use to find channels in the genre chosen. I like finding stations from around the globe. Stations come in easily and quickly each time I use it.
B007EECSFA|4.0|I love books that have a twist at the end that you never see coming. Loved the writing, although something a little confusing with British terms but very gripping read.
B00A4YVHXQ|2.0|I play the piano and don't know if that made this more difficult for me. I had trouble figuring out the point and how to make it work, but I also didn't try very long. Didn't enjoy it, so deleted it.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Works well on a Kindle. Not too many choices or settings that sometimes get confusing. Sometimes doesn't go off so pay close attention to AM/PM and volume settings.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The book was a really good book couldnt stop reading it. Recommend it to everyone.  Collens book are always amazing
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is an amazing book and I recommend it to everybody over the age of about 13 or 14. This book is a little bit depressing and I've cried several times, but I usually can't re-read books, and this one I can. I can relate to Charlie and Sam and Patrick and pretty much everybody in this book except for Craig.<br /><br />Love always,<br />Delia
B0091REZMW|5.0|Love the game has a few glitches but overall it's great.<br /><br />This game has updates but I can't update them in the app store.
0307592731|5.0|I could hard stop to do anything while reading this book.  I read through it in 2 days and loved every chapter. This is a great read for any man or woman that is undertaking something big, a goal, a passion. It's inspiring for sure.
B005CRQ2DK|4.0|I thought this book was interesting and funny. Great book for all ages. I think all children should read this book.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|By the 3rd episode of season 1 I was hooked.  So glad to be able to watch season 2 right away for free with my Amazon Prime account.  Now I'm on to season 3 which is still free for another week on PBS.org.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It took one night to finish this book though. It is easier to read on a kindle fire than it is a normal book

B006LSZECO|5.0|This book is full of twists and turns and the first real page turner I've read in ages...it really is.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I pick this because I like it.<br />I don't like it because it have a lot of words.<br />I like it because it is challenging<br />I would give it to mom, dad,bean,leads,Janice,shanell,Kathleen,<br />Cisco.
B008OOYALE|2.0|Cool man!<br />Really good for you can get a good idea to get a chance to win.so fun!! Good luck.
B002RI9ZQ8|5.0|The characters came across as real. The story kept my attention every page.  The setting in unfamiliar Sweden added rather than subtracted from interest.<br /><br />A great crime story.<br /><br />I bought and read the two sequels over a week.<br /><br />What a pity the author is dead and did not produce more.
B00A85EMVK|3.0|As others have noticed, there are some areas of this 3D transfer that are really grainy. But its odd because it will look absolutely beautiful on the next scene. The grainy stuff is NOT the entire film, but there are a number of sub-par scenes where its pretty bad.<br /><br />Having said that, the 3D effect is quite good...considering the age of this movie. The 3D is no Avatar, but I was impressed for sure. The flight ops sections are excellent and are worth buying the 3D copy.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is an addictive series. Great actors, wonderful period scenery and costumes and a peak into a world that does not exis. And if it did i probably would not belong to it. Plus an involving story line. Altogether it catches you up and carries you along. Beware of finding yourself sitting up until the wee hours watching episode after episode.<br /><br />For someone who is used to the utter simplicity and of Netflix, it was a bit annoying clicking my way through to the right page. ALso streaming was interruped from time to time for the buffering? to happen. A minor frustration.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book keeps you on  your toes when it comes to knowing who is the good person in the relationship.  Many twists and turns.  Even though I was warned by another reviewer that there was a lot of fowl language, I thought it was a bit excessive. My reason for only 4 stars.  Otherwise, it is a good read
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|I've read the series, in order, and have enjoyed all is the books addressing parts of his past.  This is no exception.  Like most, I do not put them down!  A perfect revenge story!
B001HNE3NO|5.0|I love fiction written in an historical setting.  Sarah's Key gives a human story in present time and sets you in a historical period at the same time. A nicely written novel that keeps your interest throughout the book.
B004YW4L5K|4.0|I have been in a travelers state of mind for a while, and this book really had the type of journey that leads you on a weaving path. It also seemed particularly vivid for me to be reading it during a long cold Midwest winter. Gaimans fantasy is interesting because it takes place right under the nose of an unsuspecting world.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love this show and hang on to every word that is said.  I have season one and two.  I watch them repeatedly, never tiring of this excellent show.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|Not what I expected. Totally different that the angry birds game but still fun. Great for kids' problem solving abilities.
B000OB5UU0|5.0|I happened upon this documentary one late evening on Satellite TV.  Never a fan of Metallica other than their mainstream singles \\"Nothing Else Matters\\" and \\"Enter Sandman,\\" I was nevertheless utterly fascinated by this glimpse inside the psyche of Metallica.  When I thought of Metallica I thought of these tough guys who played fast and hard metal, never letting their guard down from that image.  But, here were the members of Metallica close to tears, engaging in therapy sessions, attending a daughter's ballet class and discussing the merits of sobriety.  As the documentary unfolds, we learn that their bass player of 15 years (Jason Newsted) has just quit.  Apparently, he wanted to explore side musical projects and Metallica's lead singer/rhythm guitarist James Hetfield vetoed that freedom of expression.  Complicating things further, James Hetfield is suffering with his own demons of alcoholism and checks himself into rehab.  Remaining band members drummer Lars Ulrich and lead guitarist Kirk Hammett are left behind to ponder whether Metallica can continue recording their album, but more importantly...do they have a future at all?  In comes therapist Phil Towle (hired by Metallica's management) to help the band better communicate their feelings with the goal of keeping the band intact.  Documentarians Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky came into this project to provide some promotional film for Metallica's new album.  Instead, they wound up working with Metallica for three years on this documentary as the situation unfolded in ways they never predicted.  James Hetfield in particular becomes a focal point for the documentary.  We watch him grow from a father missing his son's first birthday to drink vodka and kill bears in Russia to a dedicated father taking the time out from recording to attend his daughter's ballet lesson.  Therapist Phil Towle keeps the band \\"together\\" as well as record producer and friend, Bob Rock.  Bob is actually recruited to play bass on the new Metallica album in the wake of Jason Newsted's departure.  When James comes back from rehab, his change in attitude and demeanor is striking.  It is very heartwarming to see his renewed dedication to being a husband and father.  He eases himself (with some trepidation) back into the recording studio with Metallica.  His new schedule for the recording studio is from noon to four so he can be home for dinner with his family.  This causes a bit of a problem with the other band members who would like to continue on while the inspiration is flowing in the studio.  James doesn't want the other band members to listen to their recordings or discuss/decide things while he's gone.  As part of Lars Ulrich's personal therapy, there's an INCREDIBLE session with original Metallica guitarist Dave Mustaine (replaced by Kirk Hammett).  Dave Mustaine is the \\"Pete Best\\" of Metallica.  He was unceremoniously fired from Metallica just when they were on the cusp of success.  Although he immediately formed his band Megadeth to much much success, his life has always been clouded by the fact that he was kicked out of Metallica.  As he says in the therapy session with Lars and Phil Towle, \\"Am I happy always being number 2?.....No!\\"  An intensely honest and poignant confrontation about how being kicked out of Metallica has defined his life, followed by actual tears was an incredible thing to behold.  Towards the end of the documentary circumstances finally bring Metallica to a place of searching for a replacement bass player. In doing so, they are confronted by unresolved grief over the death of their original and beloved bass player, Cliff Burton.  Cliff was an amazing talent; a classically trained musician who taught Metallica about music structure and melody.  His influence in their songwriting on their first few albums cannot be understated.  His life was cut tragically short when Metallica's tour bus turned over as it traveled from a gig in Sweden.  Instead of properly grieving his death, they hurled themselves into auditions for a new bass player as a tour had already been booked overseas.  The band was just about to break big, and it was a decision to go forward rather than disband.  Therapist Phil Towle tells them to treasure each other as no one knows when will be the last time you see each other.  Producer Bob Rock cautions the band not to settle unless a bass player \\"knocks one out of the park.\\"  It was fascinating to see Metallica audition and jam with other famous bass players/peers like The Cult, Marilyn Mansion and Ozzy Osbourne.  They pick Rob Trujillo, former bassist for Suicidal Tendencies and Ozzy Osbourne.  They joyfully exclaim how Rob plays the bass with his fingers much like it had been played by the late Cliff Burton.  And so, the documentary ends on a hopeful and satisfying note with the band not only intact, but re-energized by the talents of Rob Trujillo as they embark on a world tour.  As James Hetfield tearfully admits as their recording sessions for St. Anger come to a close, \\"This is the hugest chapter in my life.\\", they hurled themselves into auditions for a new bass player as a tour had already been booked overseas.

B00A2BTCXI|5.0|I don't think I need to tell anyone how great this classic album is so I'll just keep my remarks to this new version. It is really really excellent!!! First of all, and most important, is the sound and it is as good as it gets. Both the stereo and surround versions sound absolutely fantastic. If that's not enough then there is the comic book style story board that you get to watch and navigate through while you listen to it. I've always liked this album but until watching and reading the accompanying picture book I never really understood what the songs were about.<br /><br />I love this and recommend it most highly. I'd buy it again in a heartbeat knowing what I know now.<br /><br />I sincerely hope that this idea of taking a classic album and putting it back out in this kind of format catches on and that we'll start seeing more of this sort of thing. I'll want to buy them all! That said, Rush's &#34;2112&#34; is not my personal favorite Rush album. That honor goes to &#34;Farewell to Kings&#34;. I'll be holding my breath until they release that one in a similar manner; storyboard, remastering, and in surround sound. I'll be one of the very first to purchase it if released! :)
B002SAUCBC|3.0|I have been reading King for over 20 years.  The Long Walk was an okay read, but I didn't like the ending.  It was also a little too sci-fi for me.
