0061726826|5.0|This is possibly one of the most difficult reviews I've ever written because, like many other people, I have been infected with amor deliria nervosa. Meaning: I loved this book.<br /><br />Delirium was an exquisite read. Lena's life, her world, is one of control and awareness. Her mother committed suicide when she was younger because she was afflicted with amor deliria nervosa - Lena vows to never be like that. She fears the procedure that will change her life forever, but she also welcomes it, wanting the normalcy that it will provide. Upon meeting Alex, a cured boy, things begin to change and Lena starts to see her world for what it really is.<br /><br />Lauren Oliver has crafted this dystopian world that, on the surface, does not appear harsh or cruel or bad. But underneath, below the blank faces and the shiny atmosphere, is a world where people are losing their emotions, the feelings cut right out of them. The setting of Portland, Maine is a character all on its own. I felt like I was right there, in Portland, smelling the ocean and feeling the salt on my skin. Oliver's writing is, for lack of a better word, breathtaking. Her characters are so human and filled with the life that the cure takes away.<br /><br />I was instantly taken with Lena and her desire to hold onto her mother's memory, but also to separate herself from it. She wants to be a good image in her family and knowing that the cure will tear her apart from her best friend Hana, is devastating. In Lena's world, love is a disease and diseases must be inoculated. When Lena begins to have deliria-like feelings for Alex, she begins to see reasons why there are Invalids and people who would rather die than lose themselves to the cure. It is terrifying and tragic and haunting and beautiful all at the same time.<br /><br />The premise of Delirium is so entirely captivating that I did not want to put the book down and I cannot stop thinking about it. Lena, Alex, Hana, even Gracie all tore into my heart and made me love them. If this is deliria, then I do not want the cure. Lauren Oliver's writing is stunning and the ending, oh, the ending, it killed me. I implore you to buy Delirium, open it the second you get it, and don't stop until you reach the back cover. It's amazing and incredible and this review does not do it justice.<br /><br />Opening line: It has been sixty-four years since the president and the Consortium identified love as a disease, and forty-three since the scientists perfected a cure. ~ pg. 9<br /><br />Favorite lines:<br />Sometimes I feel like if you just watch things, just sit still and let the world exist in front of you - sometimes I swear that just for a second time freezes and the world pauses in its tilt. Just for a second. And if you somehow found a way to live in that second, then you would live forever. ~ pgs. 110-111<br /><br />And this one:<br /><br />As I lie there with the hurt driving through my chest and the sick, anxious feeling churning through me and the desire for Alex so strong inside of me it's like a razor blade edging its way through my organs, shredding me, all I can think is: It will kill me, it will kill me, it will kill me.

0312370849|5.0|I bought this at an airport ages ago, but didn't get to it over my trip and it sat for months.  I finally picked it up and was hooked within the first page!  I learned a great amount about this time period growing up, so that alone would of held my interest.  However, I didn't even need that to hold my interest as the story was fascinating.  I felt so connected to Sarah throughout all of her experiences, and I was also intrigued by Julia.  I honestly, could not put this book down.  I literally haven't read a pleasure book in over 18 months, and this was my first in my return to reading.  Within 48 hours I had finished it - I read it at any free chance I had!  I loved learning about this actual event (the Vel d'Hiv roundup), as I hadn't known about it before.  It made it all the more real reading about someone who was going through it.  All in all, I highly recommend this book - and already have done to some of my more literary friends.  I just got DeRosnay's newer book \\"A Secret Kept\\" and I can't wait to start that!
B001LF4ARC|4.0|This book about Steve Jobs is a good indicator of character, however at some points, the author may cause the reader to become tired and discouraged,<br />but for a smart person, there are still points to learn.<br />Change your point of view and you shall benefit from the book.
B00466H3DG|4.0|The Film:<br /><br />I won't wax too rhapsodic about the movie itself. Others have done so effusively. I can say, without reservation, that this is my personal favorite film of all time. I have watched it a good 10 to 15 times, and it rewards me upon each viewing. I think it's one of the most affecting, well-observed, and *real* portrayals of a relationship ever committed to celluloid. The structure of the story is inordinately clever, and the performances are superb.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray:<br /><br />What I am reviewing here is the blu-ray edition. I have owned and watched the DVD since its release. So 14 of 15 viewings were in 480p, and now my 15th was in a new 1080p transfer. This is an upgrade, certainly. Detail, color, and contrast are quite a bit stronger than the DVD transfer. There is nothing that takes away from the presentation generally, such as edge enhancement or obtrusive Digital Noise Reduction. It is not competitive with some of the best Blu-Ray material on the market today, but this owes more to the soft, dreamy, somewhat hazy filming style, than to any technical deficiency of the disc. Don't get me wrong - this looks better than the best cable or satellite HD. It is just middling in terms of Blu-Rays. You shouldn't be getting this in order to \\"demo\\" your new A/V setup. You should be getting this because you love the movie.<br /><br />The extras are a direct port from the DVD. If it was there, it's here. None are upgraded to higher resolution, but this is to be expected. There are no new extras. The extras are quite good, it should be said (with the exception of the short EPK \\"documentary\\"), so it's nice that none have been dropped.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />I gave this 4 stars because it's not the sort of \\"home run\\" upgrade that simply demands to be purchased no matter what editions you already own (DVD to BD upgrades in this category include 2001, Fight Club, Star Trek The Original Series). Instead, this is a competent Blu-Ray that, while it definitely improves on the previous transfer, is not the sort of revelatory experience that the aforementioned discs represent. The lack of new extras make this less of a value proposition, too.<br /><br />If you don't own it already, then definitely buy this one. If you are only a minor fan and own the DVD, stick with that. If you're a huge fan (as I am), then go ahead and get it, but wait for a good deal. I'm very happy with my purchase, but can't help but feel that this film might have deserved a bit more window-dressing., is not the sort of revelatory experience that the aforementioned discs represent.

1439107955|5.0|When I saw this was a newly released book, I read Kenneth McWilliams' review - and then some excepts from the actual pages.  As Mr. McWilliams so eloquently says, the skill Dr. Mukherjee brought to making what could have been a dry, scientific tome into a can't-put-it-down story is amazing.  I've personally experienced Hodgkin's Disease, a remission of same and, later, breast cancer.  Seeing how the time-line of treatment options coincides with my own life was amazing, and provided insights into many questions.  Even though I've been actively participating in my own treatments over 25 years, I was stunned that there was so much I didn't know or understand adequately.  It was also so informative to read, from an oncologist's point of view, how their patients' situations influence, affect, inspire and [too many times] sadden them.  I'm recommending this book to everyone I know.
030746363X|5.0|I bought this book with high expectations, and I was not let down. You must be an out of the box thinker, searching for the life hacks that will make it so much easier. If you are a scientist looking for a nutrition book, you will find the evidence here, but you will have a lot more fun doing it. Do yourself a favor and buy this book. If you start with the audio version please note: It is very limited compared to the book. What a valuable resource that I will consult forever. Thank you for your research, Tim. I will implement it all.... well most.     David@GearsofBiz.com
B00008RH3L|5.0|I saw the very end bit of this movie on TV and thought it looked interesting, so started looking up reviews and looking for it in the stores.  The reviews all called it an under-rated gem, and because it's an older movie no one had it.  So I went to Amazon.  The reviews were right, the movie is a well measured web of personalities and double crossing, the prohibition era is viscerally depicted, and the relationships are multi-layered.  Each actor is exceptional in his/her role.  It is a good movie to own, because it can be watched again and again.
B002TLSSXO|5.0|I was looking for some colorful new kitchen utensils and these absolutely \\"fit the bill.\\"  They are brightly colored, and have a small elevated ridge on the bottom so that they do not directly lay on the counter or stove top which is very helpful.<br /><br />I really like the fact that they are also heat resistant since I like to leave my utensils in the pots for a while after serving.  I do not have to worry about these melting if the pot is still simmering.  These are also very easy to clean.

B0042U94UQ|5.0|This is really a great cartoon, which teaches children many virtues, especially the virtue that evil can become good.  Although the characters are not really that evil (thank goodness, children should not be exposed to true evil), the idea of the transformation brought on by true love, true charity is still remarkable considering the junk Hollywood likes to produce in regards to children's movies.  This is the only cartoon I know that shows children praying, and it also promotes reading (my three year old who did not have much interest in books beforehand started asking us to read him stories after this movie).  And it is so full of excitement and fun that kids can never get bored.  There are a couple moments of crass humor that some good editing should have removed, but you can't expect Hollywood to rise out of its dung-heap completely.  This is the only modern cartoon that can match the great Pixar movies, the only other cartoons worth seeing for children.
B003WTE886|5.0|Where to begin? For me, this album is and I will say it again, a work of art. Weather how original it is, that's really up for you to decide but you can't deny that this is very moving and haunting music which is what music should do. How original or if it's in a genre of itself is really not the point. I will admit that Taylor does fit into a genre but she does it so well and with great passion and even maturity. If you want to think of her as nothing but a celebrity, listen to the tracks \\"Enchanted\\" and \\"Last Kiss\\" and try telling me the same thing. It's kind of hard if you ask me.<br /><br />I usually listen to groups like R.E.M., The Cure or Sarah McLachlan and even old school alternative rock groups like The Replacements so including Taylor Swift in my collection feels a little out of place, I do agree. I guess that music is music no matter what and it doesn't matter what style it fits in. This album has moved me in ways that I don't think anyone who feels the same way can explain. These melodies are beautiful and uplifting which is what makes them great. I put this in my top 10 albums, along with the likes of U2's The Joshua Tree or Sarah Mclachlan's Fumbling Towards Ecstasy.<br /><br />I will end this review by naming other great tracks on the album. Every song is pure perfection in my mind but if I had to pick, Dear John, The Story Of Us, Enchanted, Innocent, Haunted, Last Kiss, Long Live. Even the cute pop style of Sparks Fly and Better Than Revenge are perfect. You didn't think that I was only going to pick the ballads did you?
B0048LPRD2|5.0|Beautiful, slow, frustrating, colorful, empty, visceral, sad, loving...are just some of the ways i can describe this film.  Once again, Noe has made something interesting and full of everything.  In this film, you are given the opportunity to die.  To transcend into the void.      This is one of the films that either has to be seen in a loud pitch-black theater, or trapped in your own dark room with a good pair of headphones.  Each sound, each conversation-along with the street noises-has to be digested.  It is the feel of the film...to be involved both in audio and visual.  If you are unable to do this, you will not enjoy this film.  It requires your full, undivided attention.  Even if it lulls you to sleep.  That's kind of the point.  Ironically.

B00433TO52|5.0|Shakespeare must be one of the most recognizable names in the world and I think it is wonderful that we have collections like this that allow us to preserve his immortal words for the next generation and the next.

That said, I think this a great collection and I only wish Shakespeare had written more! Anyway, I look forward to reading the words of one of my favorite writer on a digital screen!
0754054446|5.0|REVIEWER'S OPINION:<br />I gave this a high rating because very few books make me laugh.  The funniest parts are Sherry's guy friends helping Sherry be responsible for Hero's care.  When Sherry first travels with Hero, the guys are helping him figure out where she should sleep, how to hire an abigail for her, etc.  There's one scene where Hero's former guardian Mrs. Bagshot visits Hero.  Sherry walks in with a comment to Hero, but as soon as he sees Mrs. Bagshot, he says \\"My God\\" and immediately leaves the room.  It had me laughing.<br /><br />One of my frequent complaints with romance novels is how the author creates conflict to separate the couple.  Not so in this book.  I was impressed.  I could easily understand how Sherry was angry at leaving his hunting fun to fix things with Hero once again.  His anger and proposed solution made sense from his point of view.<br /><br />Toward the end, some events felt contrived and a bit silly, but I accepted them since the rest was so good.  One of Heyer's strengths is creating so many different types of characters.  I was intrigued and entertained with weird Ferdy.  His mind was slow and his thinking odd.  During one event, he was reminded of the Greek goddess Nemesis he heard about in school.  Then when he wrote a note to Sherry his mind wandered in his note, which was so confusing it was funny.  He meant to write a metaphor but made it sound like a Greek fellow was after them.  A lot of different things happen in the book.  It was a fun read all the way through.<br /><br />The narrator Eve Matheson was wonderful - as usual.<br /><br />STORY BRIEF:<br />Sherry is 24 and will inherit his wealth at age 25 or when he marries.  His uncles manage his money and are too restrictive.  He suspects one of the uncles is skimming money from estate.  He has no desire to marry, but he wants possession of his money.  So he asks the local beauty Bella to marry him.  She refuses.  He decides to head to town and marry the first girl he sees.  As he is driving, he sees Hero sitting by the road.  Her parents died early and she is being raised by Mrs. Bagshot.  She is treated poorly, and Mrs. Bagshot plans to send her away to work as a governess.  She is 17.  She is crying.  Over the years Sherry has been a bit of a bully to her, but he always liked her.  When he tells her his plan to marry the first girl he sees, she laughingly says \\"that would be me.\\" As he thinks about it, he decides she would be a good choice since she would let him continue his current lifestyle of gaming and chasing women.  There's no way for her to pack her bags without alerting her guardian, so Sherry takes her as she is, and off they go to London.  When he gets there, his friends help him decide where to put her up for the night and where to get clothes, etc.<br /><br />Hero is like a kitten and that's what Sherry and his friends call her.  She is so innocent and trusting of others that she is constantly getting into scrapes.  Sherry and his friends repeatedly come to her aid.  Although they marry, they don't kiss or sleep together.  Sherry treats her like a younger sister.  She does everything she can to make Sherry happy.  He doesn't know that she loves him.<br /><br />DATA:<br />Unabridged audiobook length: 13 hours 46 minutes.  Narrator: Eve Matheson.  Swearing language: none.  Sexual content: none.

031603438X|1.0|Keith Richards unfortunately unmasks himself with this work. He is a bitter man who we consistently find whining about his circumstances and colleagues. He is so detached from reality he doesn't seem to understand why people might want to avoid a dangerous drug addict who sleeps with a gun under his pillow. And his remarks surrounding his son who died in infancy \\"I don't even know where the Son of a Bitch is buried,---or even if he is buried\\" is a clear window into his soul. He trashes nearly everyone one of his bandmates from the Rolling Stones and is ungenerous to all of them. This has to be the most ugrateful musician who has ever become famous and lauded.  Inadvertantly his pettiness and smallness elevates Mick Jagger, a result I'm sure he'd puke on.
044654759X|5.0|I have read many of Sparks' books and this one has been my favorite by far! It doesn't follow the typical sequence that most of his other ones do... that's why I loved it! It was a lot like The Last Song in that two people didn't meet, fall in love and make love all in the same day. Great read!!
B004D7GU3C|5.0|I am a huge Ricky Martin fan, so I expected to enjoy this CD. But I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of the material. There are beautiful ballads, dance tracks and songs with messages that Ricky really wants to convey. The first single (The Best Thing About Me is You) is not my favorite, but it is a nice re-introduction of Ricky to pop fans who haven't followed his recent efforts in Spanish. The other song with a Spanish and English version (Shine) is very catchy and more to my taste, but the real gems are the Spanish songs. Ricky's voice has matured and sounds fantastic. Desmond Child is clearly a master who understands how to present Ricky effectively. Give this CD a chance even if you don't remember much about Ricky. It really rivals his masterpiece, Vuelve. In fact, buy both of them and have a beautiful evening. This CD reminded me of everything that I love about Ricky.

B001IBIHQ4|5.0|Unfortunately, some comparisons between The Pacific and Band of Brothers have not been kind to the former series. The reason seems less about movie-making and more about the disturbing reality of war, which is so graphically captured in The Pacific.     Band of Brothers was based on the book by the late Stephen Ambrose, whose books on the American Army in World War II talked constantly about how the volunteer soldiers of America could defeat soldiers produced by fascist regimes and suggested that war--or the right type of war--can be an act in nobility. Indeed, the violence in BOB served to underscore the nobility and heroism of what happened in the European theater.    In the Pacific, the emphasis is not on nobility and moral superiority, and is much less an ode to the Greatest Generation and the Good War theme than was BOB. In the Pacific, the emphasis is on survival, unimaginable brutality and the depths to which men in war can reach. You come away from BOB feeling uplifted. You come away from The Pacific feeling numb.     Regarding the movie-making aspects of the series, I had no problems with the sex and language. If someone is not good enough to watch the sex scenes and hear the language, he probably is not old enough to watch the graphic violence. And if a few of the non-combat scenes were gratuitous, the scenes involving the Basilone and Lena relationship were great television.
0743277708|5.0|I've heard that one of my favorite stories, The Hobbitt, was originally written by J. R. R. Tolkien for his children - it wasn't even meant for publication.  If not for the prodding of his friend, C. S. Lewis, it might never have been published.  And in the introduction to Watership Down, Richard Adams explains that it was borne out of a request by his daughters for a story on a long car ride - not just any story, but a story made up just for them.  And luckily for us, they encouraged their father to finish the story and have it published.<br /><br />Watership Down (which is a very dramatic-sounding title) starts when Fiver has a foreboding of danger for the warren.  His prophecies, however, are rejected by the chief rabbit, and he and his friend Hazel convince a few others to leave the warren in search of a place to start a new one.  But there are a great many dangers out in the world: foxes and wolves, weasels and stoats, and not least of all man and his machines.  That's right, this is a story about rabbits.  No, they're not rabbits who wear little mittens and coats with buttons - they're real rabbits who forage in the grass and occasionally raid gardens.  But they also have their own language and legends and mythology, and we're treated to plenty of that in this captivating story as we follow Hazel, Fiver, Bigwig, Silver, Dandelion, Pipkin and the others on their odyssey.<br /><br />This book is often called an allegory, although Mr. Adams has insisted it was never meant as such and was simply \\"a story I told to my little girls.\\"  But there certainly seem to be elements of symbolism.  The legends of El-ahrairah, a type of Brer Rabbit, are told by the rabbits with almost religious reverence.  The Black Rabbit of Inl&eacute;, another figure from their legends, might be compared to the Devil, and General Woundwort made me think of Joseph Stalin, ruling with an iron fist - errr, paw, I mean.  And Fiver certainly seems to have a gift of prophecy, but the comparisons are only conjecture on my part and the legends add color and texture to a wonderful story.<br /><br />I'll admit I was hesitant to read this - a \\"classic\\" about bunnies?  And it's not even very old, having been published originally in 1972.  But I think it's certainly deserving of the attention it's received ever since and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  There's some violence and it can be occasionally frightening or sad, but I loved it and found myself genuinely concerned for Hazel and Fiver and Bigwig and their group.  I listened to the audio book read by Ralph Cosham (and my kids would cast questioning looks my way: \\"A story about rabbits, Dad?  Really?!?\\") who does an excellent job.  In fact, I plan to follow Mr. Adams example and listen to the audio book with the kids the next time we have a long drive.

B002WPVNOS|2.0|OneRepublic hit it big when their song Apologize became the biggest song of the year; the track still gets prominent airplay even today, four years later. No followup single ignited quite the way that one did, with Stop and Stare being the only real success on Billboard. This time around, the band doesn't even try to replicate Apologize, which is a good thing. The beats are a bit harder and deeper, but not altogether dissimilar to Dreaming Out Loud. What results is an album that peaks high and doesn't so much dip low as just fade into facelessness.    Made For You: The opening track is solid, though not all that memorable. The hook is catchy, but the added outro is unnecessary and doesn't add much. C+    All The Right Moves: The lead single sounds like nothing from Dreaming Out Loud, making it a great song to introduce this album. The vocals are urgent and the beat is great, but it's not particularly epic. B    Secrets: The second single, and the best song on the album. The subtle beginning sparks and then ignites with the chorus, which is as catchy as anything OneRepublic has ever released. This should've been more successful. B+    Everybody Loves Me: A very odd song for this band to record, but very welcome. The beat is different, focusing on more percussion, and the whole thing is just fun with the ego in overdrive. A-    Missing Persons 1 & 2: Just as some momentum was forming, this stops the hooks dead. This isn't a bad song, but there's absolutely nothing exciting about it. C-    Good Life: A great song to recover with. The third song on the album to eclipse anything the band has done thus far, with a quiet melody that is very pleasant. B+    All This Time: While too similar in rhythm to the previous song, the hook saves this track from obscurity. Not too great, but not bad either. C+    Fear: Another song that recycles the beats of the previous song. The vocals are pretty strong, but this just isn't original enough. C    Waking Up: The same thing can be saidfor this track. This could have been merged with the previous two tracks without much hassle. C    Marchin On: Barely different from the previous two, and the same in nature lyrically to the previous. This is getting a bit ridiculous. C    Lullaby: This song was written to be sleep-inducing, and it does the job. I'm just not sure what the purpose that has on an album. D    Mercy (Bonus): Previously on the first album, this is a much better end to the album than the previous song is on the regular edition. This deserved more success as a single. B    This album is incredibly frustrating, due to how much potential was wasted. The first half is solid for the most part, but it seems like Ryan Tedder loves the beat on Good Life and decided to replicate it in very similar ways on the four songs that followed. Lullaby refuses to put a flailing album out of its misery, and this all equates to a 'singles' album. Combine four of these songs with the singles from Dreaming Out Loud, and that will get you a lean, solid OneRepublic release. As for this, it should be skipped.

B0025UHKNS|3.0|I got this for Christmas following MUCH comparison between the GF 305 and the GF 405. Bought it on Costco website. I eventually chose the 405cx based on the size of the unit, the wireless sync to the computer, and reviewer's reports of increased speed in satellite acquisition over the 305. I started running in September, after going for a run with my brother who has the 305. I could see that for serious training having a GPS watch would be a great help. I figured after reading all the reviews that the pros for the 405 outweighed the cons, or in the case of this watch, the CON, which is the touch bezel. So I opened it up Christmas day, and started to play with it. I will say that the touch bezel did not impress me out of the gate, and being the only means of navigating through the watch settings, that was a little worrisome. I took it out for a run, and did what many reviewers suggested, which was to set the data screens to auto scroll, and then lock the bezel while running to avoid inadvertent bezel touching. The satellites acquired very quickly, although I don't live in an area where satellite acquisition should be problem. The watch worked great during the run, and following the run I was able to upload the data using the ANT agent and included software to my Mac without a hitch. Subsequent runs proved the same, quick acquisition, no GPS or battery issues, and no problems uploading to Mac. I've run in temperatures ranging from 5 degrees F to 60 degrees F, anywhere from 2 miles to 13 miles, and the watch has worked well. I haven't been able to update to the latest software version, I ran through all the steps but the watch still says it's on version 2.1, and it won't allow me re-attempt the update to 2.3 again, not sure what's going on there. Heart rate monitor has worked flawlessly.  Overall, I'm pretty happy with the 405cx. The reason I gave 3 stars (I would give 3 1/2) is because the touch bezel is truly a lame feature. After running and getting sweaty, the bezel is pretty useless. Even sitting at home on the couch, it can be frustrating to operate. It's either too sensitive or not sensitive enough, and it doesn't seem to make a difference what sensitivity setting you select. All of the other features are great, I can't complain. The software is pretty plain jane, but works well enough, and Garmin Connect is what I use after I upload my runs anyways. We'll see how it holds up in warm/hot weather when summer comes, but I can't imagine much difference.  Pros:  quick satellite acquisition  wireless sync to PC or Mac  customizable data fields  virtual partner can be a good motivator  small form factor  accurate  Cons:  Bezel sucks  Kinda feels cheap, scrapes easily  Can't update software (possible user error)
B000IMVMGQ|5.0|One of the first great movies of the new millenium, GANGS OF NEW YORK failed in its initial run to earn back a $97 million dollar cost.<br /><br />Set in a violent NYC slum called Five Points, the story centers on young Amsterdam Vallon. When Amsterdam was a small child, his father, 'Priest' Vallon, leader of the Dead Rabbits gang, was slain in a vicious street battle by the Native Americans' boss, Bill (the Butcher) Cutting.<br /><br />The parentless boy is sent by his father's killer to an orphanage some miles away. When finally of age, he returns to the Points to learn that Irish immigrants still clash for control of their run-down neighborhood with the Butcher's forces. Young Vallon has sworn to avenge his father's death, but first he becomes Bill's prot&eacute;g&eacute;. His later failed attempt on the Butcher's life leaves Amsterdam alive, scarred and temporarily humiliated. After recovering from his wounds however, Vallon, as leader of the revived Dead Rabbits, challenges Bill and his minions to a formal rowdy-dow.<br /><br />Meanwhile, widespread riots and the lynching of innocent blacks occur when necessities of the Civil War impose America's first conscription act on those too poor to pay $300 for a military service waiver. The Army is called in and chaos reigns, even as Bill's Natives and Amsterdam's Irish meet in a grand street war to determine the future of their horrid tenement neighborhood.<br /><br />With an attention to detail that few motion pictures have every approached, director Martin Scorsese's superb modern masterpiece is equally brilliant in every other respect.<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(7.4) Gangs of New York (USA/Italy-2002) - Leonardo DiCaprio/Daniel Day-Lewis/Cameron Diaz/Jim Broadbent/John C. Reilly/Henry Thomas/Liam Neeson/Brendan Gleeson/David Hemmings (uncredited: Martin Scorsese)
B001P9EQH8|5.0|I purchased the amplifier for the purpose of increasing the sound output of my laptop when watching movies.  The problem we had was trying to watch a movie on a plane.  The normal volume level was too low to overcome the internal noise level of the plane. With this attached in-line, and the volume level at about 1/2, we were able to watch the movie with plenty of volume and the sound quality was great.  It performed beyond our expectations.  Great investment!
B0026P3G12|5.0|This is the best CD in my collection. We have given the albums to family and they too enjoy her tremendously.   The voice control and song selections are truly outstanding.
0060752610|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, and found alot of the advice to be very practical.  I especially enjoyed the authors candidness about the Wall Street types and how, in a gentlemanly fashion, he railed against them and all their \\"know it all\\" ways.      The book, in this edition, focuses alot on what two types of investors should do: The classic defensive investor and the enterprising investor.  One would think this advice and the book is common sense, but sadly it's not.  There are some good guidelines and mottos to invest by in this book, and I seemed to have dog eared most of the book!
B0047VEE0U|3.0|I had pre-ordered this set with much excitement. When I received it, however, (like others), my discs were loose and moving around the box--disappointing. The discs really need their own protection and not just slid into a couple of slits in the flimsy holder.  It's a shame, really, because it probably wouldn't have taken much to improve the quality for this collector's item.  That said, I still love the concept and the music (the important part) and will keep it to add to my few Harry Potter limited edition collectible items.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|Golden Globe nominated for best comedy.  In truth, it's an action comedy in which you get that the picture isn't trying to take itself too seriously.  A lot of \\"well aged\\" actors and actresses who are or were \\"A\\" list are in this picture which bumps up the quality some.  Humor is over the top and some of the \\"A\\" list people are not in their typical roles.  The love interest wasn't to my liking but she worked enough to pass the bar.

B00127RAJY|4.0|I took a look in the mirror one day and I realized that I need to work to maintain my figure.  It might sound funny to you, but I always looked like I was naturally in shape through my teens and early twenties.  I always got compliments on how fit I looked and how I must be in really great shape, but that didn't mean that I was always fit and in great shape!  Over the last three years, I gained about 20 pounds and a few months ago, I took a look at myself in the mirror and was NOT happy with what I saw.  I had to start buying pants one size larger and those x-smalls were now too small for me to wear.  Let's just say I was not happy with the way I looked.  My husband of course loves me and tells me how beautiful I am every day, but I really wanted to be happy with me, too.    So about two weeks ago, I started working out.  We have a gym at our new office building and that definitely helped, but I needed an extra push, so I got Jillian Michaels' 30 Day Shred video.  All the reviews here said it was a great video and even those who only gave it three stars had great things to say about it.  I have a few work out vidoes at home but they're collecting dust.  I figured I'd give it a try.      I will update this review some point soon, but after the first workout, I'm sore!  I can especially feel it in my deltoids and my thighs!  I plan on using this video at least five days a week on top of 35-40 minutes of elliptical and 20 minutes of free-weights at the office gym three times a week.  That and eating healthy... we'll see how it goes!    Bottom line is, she puts on a great routine for you and doesn't let you make any excuses.  That really is the biggest thing - not making excuses for yourself!  If you're not happy with YOU, MAKE you happy with you!
030746363X|5.0|If any book can uncover ways to do something, such as lose weight, more effectively than ANYONE else has suggested, the book is a must buy. We need to support authors like this! There are many gems in this book, like using cold (ice) applications to lose weight. Brilliant and I can't think of any other person who has mentioned it in the huge supply of weight loss books. There are many other great ideas in here. It is a collection of various \\"hacks\\" or tricks to achieve in various areas. This really is an eye-opener. Aside from the facts, it is just a great reminder to be open to new ways of thinking about how to do things. Cool! And I also always recommend the life-tranforming book [[ASIN:097430770X Effortless Wellbeing: The Missing Ingredients for Authentic Wellness]], a book that continues to astound me with its simple but ridiculously effective approach. Seriously great resources in these books. Well worth it!

B001FB5634|5.0|Disregard any bad reviews on this movie, it is incredible. It is a \\"real\\" end of the world movie that doesnt have one of those same ol endings, you know the one where the person struggles through hardship and finds a oasis at the end of the movie. The story is great and the acting is even better.  A++++
B004GCJ11C|4.0|this book is amaing! i bought it for my kindle however and the pages with lists are shown so tiny and the lettering so light that i cannot read them. that is the only flaw.
0061726826|5.0|I just don't know where to begin this review.  Every time I try to think of a way to explain how this book made me feel I just come to a complete loss.  Delirium was a novel that pulled me in so subtly I didn't realize it was happening, but once it did, it held on hard and fast and refused to let go.<br /><br />Delirium was a such an emotional read, you need to have a box of tissues beside you while you read it.  Watching these two people fight for love, struggling to keep it secret, afraid what they're doing is wrong, was a powerful thing.  It really made me realize how lucky I am to have love, to be free to show it, and enjoy it, and treasure it.<br /><br />Each of the characters in this book are so well developed that I completely lost myself in their story.  They were all unique and a true pleasure to read.  Their personalities came to life as I was reading and I felt like I was missing a friend when I was done with the book.<br /><br />Overall, this was a powerful read that has stuck with me for a long time after finishing it and I'm sure will stick with me for a long time to come.  I cannot wait for the next book to see where Lauren Oliver will take this story.  I'm sure it will be even more amazing then the first.  This book left us with an ending that promises to make for a fabulous book 2

B000002O7C|3.0|I'm not going to reiterate what other reviewers have pointed out about the severe editing, the non-chronological order, or the lack of included lyrics. Although totally true, I could have dealt with all of that and said \\"4 stars\\" (due to MANY missing tracks) but I'm knocking off an extra star because I can't listen to it on my computer without all of that #$%* anti-pirating static, which is almost unbearable on the first track and crackles throughout (which are absolutely NOT from the analog-to-digital process).<br /><br />I understand that the multi-million-dollar music companies like MCA need to protect their investments. However, I bought the CD in the hopes of transferring it to MY PERSONAL iPod so that I could listen in my non-CD-player-available car. And because MP3 technology is so ubiquitous, it's nigh impossible to locate a plain old CD player anymore so I don't own one.  Funnily enough, all of my old CDs play in my computer just fine...and I'm not about to buy one just for this CD so I guess it'll have to go into the Yard Sale box which is a damn shame because I really liked the music.<br /><br />If I were just rating the actual music, I'd say 5 stars. Beautifully composed and performed, it's stirring to my core. (I just wish there were more of it.) I am confused why \\"Two Wives\\" wasn't in the film but is on the soundtrack, but it still has the same feeling as the rest of the score, so it didn't seem out of place as I listened.  The Analog-to-Digital conversion isn't usually an issue for me, and wasn't with this recording, but then I'm not using super-high-quality headphones/stereo equipment.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|Very funny show! Great inexpensive gift for anyone as all can relate to family things. Rave reviews from everyone I gave this to as a gift. Highly recommend.
B000002V1D|4.0|So I'm new to Duran Duran. I've heard only two of their songs: \\"Sunrise\\" and \\"Come Undone.\\" Now, I've explored the Wedding Album, released back in 1993, and I can see now why this band became very successful. Their music is colorful, catchy, and beautiful. From beginning to end, it's an almost hypnotic experience. Songs like \\"Ordinary World,\\" Love Voodoo,\\" \\"Come Undone,\\" and \\"Shelter\\" bring out the best in Duran Duran with their compelling melodies and interesting lyrics. However, there are some songs in here that I didn't like. For instance, \\"Drowning Man\\" didn't do any wonders, while both \\"UMF\\" and \\"To Whom it May Concern\\" seem very bland. But still, I've enjoyed listening to this album. The popularity of Duran Duran may have expired, but there's no denying that the band has created some nice music in the 80's and 90's.<br /><br />Grade: 7.9/10
B00000IREA|4.0|This was partly a vehicle to showcase Jane Fonda's face and body, but I thought it was amusing, and in some ways is even moreso, now. Cheap special effects, 60s type of science fiction comedy. I am not sure if some of the bits which come across as comedy are meant to be comedic, but they are. This is a film everyone needs to see, because sooner or later, it will come up in conversation about movies. Even if it turns out that you don't like it, and a lot of people probably won't, it is one you need to know a little about.

Naked<br /><br />February 2nd, 2011<br /><br />Avril's debut album [[ASIN:B000066NW0 Let Go]] is a pretty good pop album. Don't listen to the haters. If you don't like her, then you shouldn't be on this page anyway. But if you do and STILL haven't tried this album out, PLEASE do because it's good. It's Avril's best album out of her first three. Is it deep? Well, some would say yes, but I'm gonna say no. It's just a fun, somewhat-varied-in-sound album. Some of the lyrics are the opposite of deep, but she was just starting out. I liked her attitude on this album. Then she had to go off the deep end with her 2007 effort, [[ASIN:B000NA1OXY The Best Damn Thing]] which was just childish and had minimal good songs on it. I think most of us agree to that. ANYWAY, onto my favorite songs.<br /><br />*\\"Losing Grip\\" starts the album off perfectly and is one of the many standouts. It's decent pop-rock and was one of my favorites even way back when. Still love to play this song.<br />*\\"Complicated\\" is another goodie, and was Avril's first single. I don't think I need to speak much more about this upbeat pop number.<br />*\\"I'm With You\\" is one of the best ballads on the album and was a single for a reason. It's great and tells a tale about feeling lonely and wanting someone to take you away.<br />*\\"Tomorrow\\" is a track that I didn't like right away. But it's up there with the best standouts because of the way she sings the song as well as the song's topic of maybe not being ready to have sex or to take that next step in a relationship.<br />*\\"Anything But Ordinary\\" is yet another standout. It's a great song about wanting to just freak out and \\"let go\\" of everything because you've always done things the right way.<br />\\"Nobody's Fool\\" is another standout, but to a lesser extent. Some people hate this track and I can see why because Avril kinda raps in it. But it's still a fun track that tells others that she's not gonna change (which sadly she kinda did) and that she's \\"got a backbone stronger than yours\\".<br />\\"Unwanted\\" is the last standout, but to a lesser extent. I just love the opening riff and wish it would come into the song more often. It's about how Avril introduces herself to some boy and he pretends she's not even there.<br /><br />The rest of the tracks are fine, if not extraordinary. They fit fine on the album but some of them aren't that exciting. However, this is a solid listen throughout and that's why I'm rewarding this with a<br /><br />\\"B-\\", 4.1 stars (or an 8.2/10).<br /><br />DOWNLOAD:<br />\\"I'm With You\\"<br />\\"Tomorrow\\"<br />\\"Losing Grip\\" &<br />\\"Anything But Ordinary\\"<br /><br />HONORABLE MENTION:<br />\\"Complicated\\"Some people hate this track and I can see why because Avril kinda raps in it.

B000062Y44|3.0|The songs and music here were written by Badly Drawn Boy (Damon Gough), and while a couple of tracks are outstanding, a lot of it turns out to only be good as background music. To be fair, of course, that is what it was intended for, but I thought it would be more of a \\"listen to\\" than it has turned out to be. You find yourself wanting to forward to the good songs, or to program just to play a couple. One outstanding track is \\"A Minor Incident\\", But I think I would consider downloading that as an MP3 in lieu of buying the CD.
1400079276|4.0|I read this book shortly after reading Murakami's \\"The Wind Up Bird Chronicle.\\" I found that both stories had much of the same themes and writing style. I was a little disappointed because I was not expecting there to be so much similarity between the two books. However, the plot is pretty different than Wind Up, so it was still a very enjoyable read. Kafka on the Shore is more of a coming of age story. Between the two, I enjoyed Win Up Bird Chronicle more, but it might be because I read it first.

0786868724|4.0|This is a true story about three men, a Jewish Rabbi, Albert Lewis; a young man named Henry Covington, and the author himself. Mitch is asked by Reb (this is the way Mitch refers to his Rabbi)to give his eulogy. At the moment the Rabbi is not dying and Mitch is confused as to why the request is made. Although he has been educated in the Jewish faith and still attends on feasts and high holy days,he doesn't seriously practice his faith. He begins to visit Reb in order to become better acquainted.  The second part of the story is about a young man, Henry Covington, who was the second youngest in a family of seven. He grew up in poverty and turned to crime. He goes to jail for a murder  which he hadn't committed. Eventually he finds faith in Jesus and becomes a pastor of a run-down and abandoned church. He begins to lead a life of helping others and in the end, due to Mitch's help, he finds those who will help him with work and donations of money and goods. Reb dies and Mitch delivers his eulogy.  In his efforts to learn more about his Rabbi,Mitch finds his faith renewed. This is a sweet sad story but the lesson is not only one of faith but tolerance for those of every religion.  As always,Mitch Albom, writes with sensitivity and warmth.  Alma Winters, author-Once Upon a Time Tales
B002ZG993Q|2.0|It was inevitable that Clooney would gray and that his face would one day show some wear. I love it that he doesn't give a rip, too. Why would he? He's been the sexiest man alive all of his life. His self-esteem is completely intact and he flaunts it in this movie.     I like to watch movies over and over. This is a one time through movie. I don't care for that. Clooney is ill at ease the entire time, and this doesn't suit him. He's at his best in a movie like Michael Clayton (where he played the law firm's fixer).     This movie was a fair way to pass some time, but it wasn't a \\"wow\\". Any time spent with Clooney is decent, but I prefer him in roles like \\"Up in the Air\\" where we see him play off his true and believable character flaws. It's not fun to see Clooney so distracted. He's a smooth one and we rely upon him to show us that cool that just rolls off of him like water. Watching Clooney in a constant distressed and nearly defeated state throughout the film is unnerving. It would make for fantastic acting only if it were believable and desirable. Who wants to see Clooney overcome? Not me. He's the guy that's too cool to be cast in the role of James Bond.
0061726826|5.0|I just finished this book, and I'm awe struck?  No... speechless?  Yes, definitely.  But first came the tears.  I made it through the book without crying (much) until the end.  Then I bawled.  Straight out, bawled.  This story was beautiful, devastating, infuriating, and oh, so very very beautiful.<br />I started out being unsure about Lena.  She says herself that she's in between.  Not beautiful, not ugly.  Doesn't stand out in any way.  She's always been a good girl, does what her aunt and everyone tells her to do.  Accepts the way of things with no questions asked.  The day of her evaluation comes and that is the day her life changes forever.  The day she says gray is her favorite color because of the way the sun sets on the water (or something like that, that's NOT a quote!), and says Romeo and Juliet is beautiful instead of saying how it's scary.  That's the day she first sees Alex and her life is forever changed.  She doesn't know it yet, at that point, but as a reader it's clear to us that this is the beginning.  It takes Lena awhile and a few out of character acts for her to realize that all the numbness around her is wrong.  That taking out a piece of someone's brain so they can't feel love, so they can't feel, is just. plain. wrong.<br />This book takes place in a city that isn't so different from cities we live in today.  There are still the rich and the poor, people still go about their daily activities of cooking, cleaning, working, etc.  But there are fewer (almost none) cars on the road due to fuel rationing, there's a fence surrounding the city keeping the wilds out and the people in, they only allow certain reading material, if people 'get infected' with deliria they can be put in prisons and even killed for it.  Love is not allowed.  Love is an infection and it will kill you.  There's even a handbook about the symptoms.<br />Alex, oh Alex.... I loved Alex.  He was sweet, and accepting and he showed Lena what is really truly important in life.  He showed her what deliria really felt like and made her realize she'd rather die then live without it.  He was an amazing character and I only wish we could have gotten to know him even better.<br />This story really makes you feel.  Makes you appreciate and makes you cherish your life and loved ones even more.<br />The side characters were great.  Hana, Lena's best friend is a bit of rebel and it's due to her rebelling and them going in restricted areas that leads Lena to Alex.  Hana is a true friend who is there for her through anything.  Encouraging her that she's making the right, or wrong, choices.<br />This book was amazing and I really don't know what to say other then that.  It was beautiful, poetic, horrifying and oh, so much more.<br />I have a feeling that I'll be choked up for days.  This is a book that as soon as you finish you want to discuss it with others.  You want to call every single person you know and tell them to READ IT NOW!  Unfortunately, I have MONTHS before I can tell the world to go buy this book so I'm just resorting to discussing with my blogger friends who have read it.<br />I can tell you this.  Go now.

031603438X|5.0|Start to finish, \\"Life\\" is a surprise. It's breezy and light. It's extremely matter-of-fact. I guess if you're writing an autobiography, you are going to want to come across as likable and Richards manages to look in the mirror and back on his life and see the things he likes.  But it's clear he was living in a different world with different rules.  Here's a brief recap: Learned to play the guitar, found some band mates, studied American blues, learned to rock, learned the music business, started to rake in serious money, could flit about the world anywhere and anytime, found money was an easy ticket to some amazing women and tremendous quantities of powerful drugs and high-quality liquor, lost some friends to drugs, learned that it's hard to keep a band together, learned that it's even harder to stay friends with a lead singer who loves/craves the limelight, met some amazing musicians along the way and gradually grew mellower with the help of courts, old age and, well, life perspective.  If you're a fan of the Rolling Stones, you should read \\"Life.\\"  If you're not, it's hard to believe you might be curious or interested in Richards' indulgences or precisely how certain records were recorded or certain guitar tones were achieved.  But Richards is one of the great rock and roll icons and it's hard to imagine a more enjoyable account of the last 45-plus years of making rock music at the level of pop stardom and musicianship that he achieved.  Richards projects perspective and while he doesn't come right out and say it, you get the sense that he knows he was extremely lucky--surviving legal scrapes, heroin and finding a band that managed, through lots of ups and downs, to hang on.  Even his image, the whole Keef thing, wasn't his doing. \\"They imagined me, they made me, the folks out there created this folk hero. Bless their hearts. And I'll do the best I can to fulfill their needs.\\"
014241543X|5.0|Wow!  I'd heard so many things about this book.  Heart-wrenchingly beautiful.  Heartbreaking.  The list goes on, but you get the idea.  And yes, it was all those things, but it was also about life, about living, about accepting and about family.  It's about a girl who is looking back at her life and all the wonderful, and less wonderful, experiences she's had in her short life.  It's her watching herself dying and having to make a decision whether to live, or to die.  And it is all in one day (well 24 hours).  It's a love story.  It's a family's story.  It's just so much!  And although I teared up quite a few times, I also giggled a time or two when she was remembering things.<br />I read this book in a day.  It's a fast read, but it's hard to put down as well.  The characterization is perfect.  I loved Mia and I loved her family.  Her punk rock unconventional parents and her cute little brother that says the most adorable things.  Her grandmother that sees Angels in birds and other animals and her grandfather that doesn't say much but clearly loves her.<br />I loved her friend Kim, who we only got glimpses of but seems to have an amazing and strong personality.<br />I loved her boyfriend Adam, and the amazing things he would do, even though I felt like we didn't really get to know him enough.  But in his punk rock style and amazingly sweet personality I found a boy I could really love.<br />And the end of the story.  I can't say much without spoiling it, but it was beautiful how the author had things unfold.  Beautiful.<br />I highly recommend this book.  It's not depressing.  It's sad, but not depressing.  Don't put it off for that.  Seriously.  Just don't.
B003EYVXTQ|5.0|First of, I didn't read the novel, so the whole discussion whether the film is bad because the book is better is irrelevant to me.  Secondly, this didn't feel as a thriller at all.  I know one thing, however:  I watched this film and was deeply impressed by the casting, the acting -- in particular the protagonist's performance -- the dialogue, and last but not least, the sets.  This film truly deserves an Oscar if only because of the set decoration.  I was allowed a 100 minutes peek into a dark, depressing world in which a stubborn, unflinching teenager fights for some security in a hostile world, an experience so intense that afterward it felt as though I had really met these individuals, traveled down there during a cruel winter and witnessed the behavior and way of living of these rough people in the Ozarks.  If a film can do that, making us forget reality and live with fictional characters, truly feel the atmosphere of a particular place, then I think it has accomplished something.  A remarkable movie!
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I love this series I just started getting into this show and have finish watching the first season. To my understanding this show is based off a book which I did not know and had a following before the series. What I love about the first season it introduces you to each of the main characters and you get to know them even though there is still some mystery to each characters. And I LOVE LAFAYETTE and of course every one else. Get for a collection and would recommend for a collection.
B001GZ6QEC|3.0|The Dark Knight, oh how my opinion has changed. This is a fresh review, after years between when I saw it in the theater, and on the original DVD release.<br /><br />The Sonar-Vision scenes were completely stupid, hokey nonsense; almost completely absurd to the point where it's unwatchable. It reminds me of that totally lame scene in Batman Begins where Batman avoids the SWAT by unleashing, or calling, a flock of bats to get away.<br /><br />The 'Batman voice' is annoying, and totally off-putting.<br /><br />Christian Bale is a horrible actor, 99% of the time. You have notable exceptions, like The Prestige, but the rule of awful definitely applies in The Dark Knight. He's basically the weakest link in the chain, outside of the hokey technology outings.<br /><br />Now that all of the hype surrounding the movie has died down, and I am able to just watch it for a movie to see, I find that I can't just sit through the entire movie for a regular viewing. What invariably ends up happening is my watching the opening bank heist scene, and all the joker and Harvey Dent/Two-Face scenes. I then take the disc out and call it a night.<br /><br />It's an OK movie, but that's all. It's not as good as the hype surrounding it.<br /><br />A word about the Blu-ray disc: I find it asinine that they printed who knows how many discs with a BR-Live feature that occurred on one day, just after the disc's release; so the feature is completely useless on the disc, now; a menu that doesn't work.

B002KSPKRS|2.0|I read the reviews and decided to try them out.    Set up - Set up seemed easy enough.  Plug in a couple wires, insert batteries, and turn it on.      Construction - The plastic felt cheap and flimsy.  The padding was nice and thick and they felt pretty comfortable on my head.  Buttons on the headphones felt loose.  The base felt very well constructed.      Performance - They worked well enough at first.  I started playing some Call of Duty: Black Ops and things sounded really nice.  Then people started chatting.  Either I couldn't hear them at all or they were blowing my ears out.  I tried adjusting the chat volume.  Turing the chat volume halfway was akin to hitting mute.  Also, I could see that people were speaking but couldn't hear anything.  I'd have to jiggle the cord and that seemed to work but would stop working again.  I don't think anybody could hear me speaking.      Overall - If you can get a pair that works right, they're probably nice.  Seems to be hit and miss on whether you get a good pair or not.  I'm not the type to keep exchanging them until I get a good pair so I returned them.
142311339X|2.0|[...]     Why all the love?  Seriously, why? While certainly an entertaining read, The Lost Hero is nowhere NEAR as good as the Percy Jackson books, and it does no deserve the overwhelmingly 5-star reviews it is getting.  First, the characters.  The characters in Percy Jackson and the Olympians (PJO), were well-rounded and three dimensional.  Percy himself was a sarcastic, goofy, and completely  believable hero. Annabeth was a proud, smart, and loyal girl.  They were like real people, with strengths and weaknesses.  You may not agree with everything they did, but you could still understand and sympathize with them.    On the other hand, Jason, the main character of TLH, is very flat.  He has the personality of a robot, and his only character traits seem to be a bit of courage and looking hot.  (Note-I have no problem with brave, good looking guys,  I just want them to have a bit more personality.)  I'm aware that Jason's memory loss  will affect his personality (or lack thereof), but I will argue that it should not erase all traces of his former character (whatever that was).  Why?  Well, for a start, all of Jason's memories have NOT been taken.  He remembers plenty of things about people and the world.  He's not like Nienor from Tolkien's The Simarillion, who, when her memory was erased, no longer remembered the most basic things.  She didn't know what light was, or how to feed herself.  All of Jason's memories were NOT stolen like this, therefore he have at least somewhat of a personality.  But he doesn't.  His thought and reactions to anything are very bland and emotionless.  His entire story reads like a fanfiction of PJO, what with his coming from another demigod camp and being the brother of a beloved character from PJO.    But while Jason is boring, he isn't nasty and completely unlikeable.  Those traits are reserved for out \\"heroine\\".  Whether she deserves this title is highly questionable at best.  Ah, Piper.  The most pathetic, whiniest, weakest, most obnoxious female ever created by Riordan.  Her \\"charmspeaking\\" powers are a Dues ex Machina, which the characters can use to get out almost every tough situation without having to work at it or use their brains.  She's better at it then almost anyone, despite the fact that she's known she had this power for less then one week.  Piper is (supposedly)beautiful, which I wouldn't mind if it was handled with a degree of subtlety.  But instead it is slammed over our heads with a two-ton brick.  She's \\" extremely cute\\" \\"seriously pretty\\" \\"beautiful\\"  \\"the most beautiful thing [Jason's] ever seen\\", ect, ect, ect.   Another problem I have with Piper is her constant whining.  She whines about her dad, she whines about her friends, her mom, Jason and how he won't hug her, her siblings, her looks, her cabin, a beauty blessing that takes pimples off her face and makes her hair tangle-free . . . the list goes on and on.  And Piper never has to make sacrifices to get what she wants.  She never truly has to make the decisions that is hinted at throughout the first two-thirds of the book-that is, she never has to choose between rescuing her father or betraying her friends.  She gets them both handed to her on a silver platter.    Why everyone loves Piper's \\"showdown\\" with Drew (her cabin's head counselor) is beyond me.  It's like almost every book/movie set in a high school-awkward new girl comes to new place and is bullied and humiliated by the school Bully Girl.  Then new girl goes through some experience that strengthens her, then returns and humiliates Bully Girl.    I fail to see why Piper holding a dagger to an (unarmed!) Drew's throat and telling her to have a duel or step down (how the heck can she have a duel when she has no weapon and can't get to one), is any better then Drew's \\"tyranny.\\"  But despite this, everyone loves her.  If they don't, they're automatically villains or stupid, jealous b*****s    So in short, Piper is a whiny, pathetic, Mary Sue.    Give me Annabeth anyday.  Moving on-to the only one of the trio that I actually like.  Leo Valdez.  Is.  Awesome.  He has a real personality, he has humor, and he has REAL and REALISTIC feeling and emotions.  He's had a hard life (much worse then Piper's, in my option.  I mean, she doesn't get attention from her dad.  He's lived for 7 years convinced that he killed his mother), but no way is he the whiner that Piper is.  He gets jealous of Jason's perfection and how much everyone loves him (hey, who can blame Leo for that), but is still a loyal friend to him, no matter what happens.  Also, did I mention Leo's interactions with Thalia are HILARIOUS? Definitely my favorite part of the book.    The relationships.  Riordan has seriously taken a nosedive with those.  PiperxJason was shoved in our faces with the subtlety of an angry elephant.  Piper is constantly mooning over how hooooooottt Jason is..  And he does the same for her.  Neither cares for much for the other aside from looks.        The book's plot, unfortunately, is very similar to that of PJO, especially The Lighting Theif.  To quote percabethluver, (from Blue Trident, a PJO Fansite), who explained it all much better then me-    1. The story starts with 3 demigods at a school, totally unaware of their heritage. Then, they get taken to Camp Half-Blood, and on the way, there's a big battle. In the battle, someone \\"dies\\"(later, they find out that they are taken hostage somewhere, and can be saved) trying to get them there.  2. There are three main characters, just like in TLT.  3. The three demigods are latecomers. All the other demigods came to Camp Half-Blood at an earlier age.  4. When they get taken to Camp Half-Blood, they are initially a bit skeptical of the Greek gods, but are quickly convinced by the weird events of the above-mentioned battle and some explanations.  5. The demigods somehow find out that certain powers are very, very rare. They turn out to have those powers, to the amazement of everyone.  6. They get a quest to travel cross-country, to California(in both books, they go to the exact same state. Lame much?) But on the way, they must stop somewhere to get advice from someone.  7. At their final destination, they battle the main threat of that one book, and win. They are warned that this is only the beginning- and that another, more powerful force is slowly rising.  8. When they come back to Camp, they face their old fears, and think \\"Only *short time period* ago, I would have been scared. Now, after facing *things that happened on their quest*, this is nothing.\\" They then go and conquer whatever fear it was they had before.    I'll be reading The Son of Neptune, but only for the sake of Leo and Percy, who I think will appear in it.    My advice for The Lost Hero is to get it from the library, instead of spending 18 bucks on it like I did.
B002ZG977Y|1.0|\\"Clash of the Titans\\" is a truly amazing film -- never before have I seen a movie that is so BUSY, and yet so staggeringly DULL.<br /><br />This stupid movie was apparently made to cash in on the wild success of [[ASIN:B000QXDED6 300]], but it pretty much missed everything that made that movie enjoyable. Instead, this remake of the classic cult film is full of everything and nothing -- Louis Leterrier crams it with horrible acting, endless CGI, and an obnoxiously preachy plot that ends up being brain-bleedingly boring.<br /><br />A fisherman finds a floating coffin, which holds a dead princess and a still-living baby. He adopts the child, Perseus (Sam Worthington), and raises him as well -- until the god Hades (Ralph Fiennes) destroys Perseus' family and fishing boat. He's marched to the city of Argos, where he sees the king and queen declare war on the gods...<br /><br />... only to have Hades proclaim that if Princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos) is not sacrificed within ten days, the kraken will destroy Argos. A mysterious woman named Io  (Gemma Arterton) tells Perseus that he is actually the son of Zeus (Liam Neeson), and is the only hope of slaying the kraken and saving Argos.<br /><br />Honestly, the story of Perseus is one of the awesomest, most movieworthy stories in Greek mythology -- you've got a demigod hero, a sea monster, a flying horse, and a snake-headed creature that turns people to stone. But apparently, THAT story isn't good enough for the people in Hollywood. They even mock the original movie in one scene involving the mechanical owl Bubo.<br /><br />Instead director Leterrier crams all sorts of weird random stuff into the movie -- it's a constant onslaught of giant scorpions, CGI monsters, djinni, and witches who look like Guillermo del Toro discards. The plot feels skeletal and bloated at the same time, with horribly silly dialogue (\\"It is death who should be afraid of us!\\") and dozeworthy action scenes.<br /><br />Even worse, the screenwriters seem hell-bent on pushing their own theological philosophy on us (\\"God sucks and ruins everything, so don't worship him\\") NON-STOP. There's scene after scene of \\"We hate the gods! Gods are awful! Let's stupidly anger them even though they're incredibly powerful!\\"... only for them to undermine their own message in the last reel.<br /><br />And really, how can you go wrong when you have Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes in your movie, playing GODS? Well, you can cast the bland lump that is Sam Worthington as your lead, a pouting prettyboy who brings no charisma to his role, giving Neeson nothing to do except throw divine tantrums and Fiennes nothing to do except slink around being vaguely sinister (since a god of death HAS to be evil, right? WRONG!). As for Gemma Arterton, she just sort of wanders in and out of the story, serving as a source of convenient information.<br /><br />\\"Clash of the Titans\\" would be better titled \\"Flush of the Titans\\" -- a reeking lump of brainless cinema that stupefies even as it preaches. The original is flawed, but infinitely superior to this one.hilosophy on us (\\"God sucks and ruins everything, so don't worship him\\") NON-STOP. There's scene after scene of \\"We hate the gods!

1934030198|5.0|I used Joe's cyclists training bible [[ASIN:1934030201 The Cyclist's Training Bible]] to help my training schedule and I think it is the single most important thing I have done for my bike racing.  The cycling book is approachable for both beginners and advanced racers, but it you are in your first year of bike racing you are not ready for Joe's training schedule yet. (Read it for next year, but just try not to burn out your first year...)     I bought the tri bible for my wife, and from flipping through it I'd say it is the same book, but with two more sports.  That being said, I only race bikes (no tris) but Joe's cycling bible really taught me how to train and set up a schedule to build up to target races.  I think that you have to approach these books knowing that they are written for people who are serious about training for their sports and committing to the lifestyle.  Joe teaches you what to do to be the best racer you can be, but to do that you are going to have to follow his training cycles and peaking schedule.  By far the most informative book on training I have come across.

Another amazon reviewer said she had the same problem but to try it again because it was worth it once you finally got \\"into\\" the story.  I have to say, I was annoyed at first by all these different characters being introduced through letters.  But once I got to know who everyone was, the story was really really good.  I learned a lot about what \\"probably\\" happened during WW2.  The characters were interesting and very well described.  Sad to read the last page, didn't want it to end.  If you are struggling like I did, keep going.....  It is a very different writing style for a book, being that it is all letters but it works.
B002N1AEN2|4.0|I try to refrain from giving an album a five star review, especially a debut album. The coveted five star review suggests a classic or one for the ages, so luckily, The xx's debut falls slightly short and rightfully so. Now that doesn't mean the album is without it's charms. There's plenty of it as a matter of fact. Yet, it's also not without a few flaws. With that said, xx is one intoxicating and sensual album that evokes an all at once sweltering hot and steely cold mood and tone that's very addicting.  \\"Intro\\" is without a doubt one of the best, if not THE best, introductions to an album I've ever heard. It's 2 minutes, 7 seconds of moody and brooding beauty soundscape that's definitely worth the price of the album purchase alone. The rest of the album is a unique blend of duet drenched love songs that tread heavily on both pain and joy. The vocals are precisely downbeat. Some may call the vocals deeply sustained or monotonous. However, I find the vocals quite appropriate, and they accompany the music brilliantly. To classify this album into a specific genre may prove to be difficult. If it were up to me, I would classify The xx as electro-pop, post-rock, and contemporary r&b. A lot of listeners take offense to the latter. I suppose there's a stigma attached to the genre of r&b. One may think of Beyonce or Mary J. Blige, but don't forget that r&b does stand for rhythm and blues, something The xx has plenty of. My favorite song on the album has got to be very carnal \\"Infinity,\\" an homage to Chris Isaak's \\"Wicked Game.\\" It's fantastic! Though the flaws on xx are minor they still keep it from being the classic many hipsters are clinging to. All of the songs, aside from a few, sound the same. It's one thing for an album to be consistent as a whole, but perhaps the xx mistook consistency for repetitiveness. Though the album certainly does work as a whole, there's really no distinction between individual songs. I found myself mistaking one song for another after pressing the shuffle button in my car. Make no mistake, this fact has no bearings on the quality of the songs. It simply just means they cannot act or play independently. Also, after a short while, perhaps a few months or so, the album may become slightly dreary. It doesn't quite stand the test of time it should if it were a five star album. Alas, all is not lost. The xx album is still far more interesting than most albums released by bands who've been around much longer. As far as debuts go, this is one is quite impressive. It absolutely deserves a listen to.

0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game is an engrossing saga following a young prodigy who becomes the hope of the human race. It would be utterly unfair to pigeonhole it as a sci-fi classic, because it is so much more than that. Ender's Game is a fantastic story that will grip you from cover to cover.<br /><br />Orson Scott Card's preeminence as a writer comes from his deft character development that drops you into their shoes and subtly brings you to feel every emotion they experience. This story follows the boy protagonist, Andrew \\"Ender\\" Wiggin, from his troubled childhood, to school, and into an early adulthood. Although the novel is set in a science fiction universe, it masterfully incorporates the themes that underly all great stories. Competition, fear, alienation, and friendship swirl in Ender's mind as well as yours as you enter into his experiences through Card's brilliant writing.<br /><br />While Ender's Game is a great work of sci-fi, it is so much more. Pick this book up and you won't be disappointed; it has quickly become one of the modern must-reads.
B0049GYXDG|5.0|Of all the feature films Walt Disney personally produced, \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" is one of the best. It easily holds its own with the Big Five, and is one of the high points of post-War animation. It is a near-masterpiece.<br /><br />I didn't used to think this way. This was partly due to feeling Disney deviated too much from the original (which I was wrong about), as well as recognizing that Carroll's original is impossible to dramatize in a way that preserves the character of the original (which /is/ true). If you kick back and take the sequence of largely disconnected events as they come, it's a lot of fun.<br /><br />Kathryn Beaumont's Alice is spot-on, perfectly capturing the character's hard-headed common sense, and occasional naivete/vulnerability. Her performance gave the animators exactly what they needed, and they capture her personality perfectly. (I'm not bothered by her brief song about not taking her own advice. It gives a rather hectic film a moment's pause, and it's consistent with Carroll's description of Alice as someone who boxed herself on her own ears in annoyance at her own behavior.) She also looks a lot like Shelley Long. Ed Wynn and Jerry Collonna are perfectly cast as the Mad Hatter and March Hare. (Rocky & Bullwinkle fans will note that Captain Peachfuzz is a direct lift of the Mad Hatter.)<br /><br />\\"Alice\\" represents a major change in Disney's animation style. For the first time, characters are drawn in an un-naturalistic, severely minimalist style, no more complex than a comic-strip drawing (Tweedle Dum/Dee, the Carpenter, Mad Hatter, Queen of Hearts). Some backgrounds verge on the abstract, particularly in the Queen of Hearts sequence. The March of the Cards, with its memorable music, is a tour-de-force of animation, especially the startling end.<br /><br />The songs are of consistently high quality, with the settings of several Carroll verses standouts. For comparison, listen to Alec Wilder's boringly academic settings for the otherwise delightful readings of the books by Cyril Ritchard.<br /><br />Box-office-wise, \\"Alice\\" did the ol' flopperino, which Disney ascribed to its \\"having no heart\\". Well, neither do the books. Disney has to be congratulated for largely sticking with the original, and not trying to sentimentalize the books. * For someone so determinedly middle-brow, Disney was often well-ahead of his audience.<br /><br />As with similar direct transfers from the Technicolor negative, there is a huge gain in sharpness, resolution, and shadow detail, along with a reduction in \\"smear\\" and \\"muddiness\\".

032147404X|2.0|Scott Kelby comes across as an affable buddy.  This book is perfect for the beginner who doesn't want to be overwhelmed with theory and just wants to be told what to do.  Minus the chit-chat, the real 'meat' of this book could easily be contained in a short article. If you want to understand your camera, understand photography, be enlightened in any way--look elsewhere.  As a novice, it should have spoken to me, but I'm not knowledge-adverse.  I would have given it 3 stars as there are some useful tips for a beginner, but the silly humor and 'beginner reader' writing style was annoying to me.    Pros:  - Mercifully short  - Well illustrated with nice photos  - Some useful tips  - Easy to understand    Cons:  - 24.99 msrp for an article?  4.99 would have lessen my pain  - No attempt to even explain digital photography  - Essentially just a list of tips:  get a tripod, use RAW, use Photoshop, etc.  - Probably as much inane humor as any real information.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|My son had this knife and after a hardcore camping trip where I watched him hack down small trees and chop wood with it, I knew I had to have one too.  It is truly a heavy duty survival knife that comes out of the box incredibly sharp.  (so sharp I cut myself unboxing it!)  Great weight and comfortable handle.  Plus it gives you the confidence that you are carrying a knife that you know will perform any way you need it too.  Will be buying more as gifts for my friends.
B004IAR4Q6|1.0|It's like T-Bone created yet another of his projects from some other era and had Gregg come in and sing on it.  While Gregg's singing is fine, it really feels like he's a guest vocalist. Does T-Bone have to approach everything through his retro vision?

I dont have the problem w/ the comfort as the Crocs promise, this the best comfort piece of footwear I've ever wear inside the kitchen for my entire carrer as a chef.  The problem I encountered with this BISTRO MODEL was the under sole WORKMANSHIP! the glue being used was too weak and AFTER two months of used, the sole was detached, I tried to re-glue w/ shoe glue but the same things happens, the sole detached again after two days...I AM NOT RECOMMENDING THIS OR I WILL NOT BUY THIS particular model again. I hope the MANUFACTURER will offer GUARANTEE OR REPLACEMENT on this product, AS A PART OF THIER GENUINE COMMITMENT OF THE QUALITY OF THIER PRODUCTS & CONSUMER SATISFACTION. Now I looking for a new replacement of this footwear. of course, same brand! any recommendation???

B001BNFR6W|5.0|I love this box set.  After watching some of the episodes, I realize that they had some of the best comedic writers for this series, not to mention the actors' hilarious talents!  Compared to what sit-coms we have to watch today, none even come close to Will & Grace.  I am so glad that I purchased this set, and will enjoy it for years to come.
B003UESJH4|5.0|I took my 85 year old mother to this film.  She remembers her 5th grade teacher talking about the abdication of King Edward. She and her brother didn't know that King George stuttered until we saw the movie.    This film was the most incredible and moving movie I have ever seen. The pain that King George lived with was unimaginable and I amazed at all he accomplished without the world knowing his handicap.
B003EYVXTG|5.0|WINTER'S BONE is one of 2010's most honored movies earning 4 Oscar noms including Picture, Actress and supporting actor---and they deserve it.<br />Jennifer Lawrence is brilliant in her emotionally mature performance as the determined Ree.  With just a look, she melts your heart.  John Hawkes is superb as her druggie uncle who manages to convey both fear and compassion.  The whole ensemble is perfect.<br />WINTER's BONE is a grim, unflinching look at family relationships and trapped people, but it is also moving and tender.  Ree's love for her family is inspiring.<br />WINTER's BONE probably won't win any Oscars but it's a stunning movie.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
0393327655|5.0|I read this book when it first came out, and was so profoundly inspired by his thought provoking ideas that I couldn't put it down until I finished it.  I then proceeded to reread it and tell everyone I knew about it.  You may or may not like his ideas, but he is a courageous author who makes us think about what it means to be human.

B003KGBISY|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time.  It's got well-drawn characters with amazing subtlety.  It's got a ton of heart, humor and pathos, without flinching from realities and concerns of the people it presents.  The battle sequences big and well-choreographed, though one might complain there aren't as many explosions or splurting blood as we're used to nowadays (though I would say none of that is a substitute for this high of quality).  Though very long by most any movie standard, the pacing is perfect and never leaves you bored.  An ensemble cast elevates it further and really inhabit the characters they play, especially Toshiro Mifune who makes it a lot of fun.    The Blu-Ray transfer is very well done.  This movie has certainly never looked or sounded better. The extras are the same as in the previous 3-disc DVD release as far as I can tell; which is to say the extras are extensive and a pleasure to watch.  The cost, as with most any Criterion Collection release, might be prohibitive to some, but if you are a fan of great cinema then the quality and extras are easily worth it.
0525951652|5.0|I love Ken Follett and this one did not disappoint!  The only bad thing I can say is that it went too fast and the second in the trilogy won't be out until 2012.
B002ZG981E|5.0|Most people don't associate action movies with well-developed ideas and smart plotting, but this movie accomplishes that and more.  You could have a ton of fun with this movie even without delving way too deep into it, but for those who desire more from their movies, there is a decent amount to think over and notice with repeat viewings.  Definitely a must-see.
0790729407|5.0|I saw this movie recently and I was glued. Completely captivated. Of course I love Liam Neeson movies, but I also like Alan Rickman (played Prof. Snape in \\"Harry Potter\\" films, \\"Quigley Down Under\\"), Aidan Quinn (\\"Legends Of The Fall\\"), Steven Rea ( i believe he was in \\"44 Inch Chest\\") and I was surprised to see Julia Roberts in this. She played her part well. I didn't recognize her for half of the movie.<br /><br />This role was tailor made for Neeson. I don't think there could of been any other actor that could of done it better then him. He really did the part very well. Everyone cast in the movie, acted their roles very well.... Definitely a great movie from start to finish!! This is a movie to own.
B000UX6THK|5.0|This is a TV series that seems to start off with many of the elements of your typical '90s soap opera, but with a murder mystery thrown in the mix.  However, as you watch it you'll notice that not only are the characters more quirky than what you might be used to, but things just seem... off.  Strange things happen, people aren't always idiosyncratic so much as they are just plain weird, and possibly insane. The farther you get into the series the more it evolves into something never quite seen before on television. The DVD transfer is good, and the extras are nothing to sneer at. Definitely worth the buy.
0684830485|5.0|[[ASIN:0684830485 For Whom the Bell Tolls (Scribner Classics)]][[ASIN:B001OW5NX2 For Whom the Bell Tolls]]    By the time Ernest Hemmingway wrote For Whom the Bell Tolls, he was already a major celebrity in the international literary world.  His early and celebrated books, The Sun Also Rises, and A Farewell to Arms, had many fellow writers as well as critics seeing For Whom the Bell Tolls as a work comparable in stature to these earlier works.  Hemmingway himself volunteered for the republican (democratic) cause in Spain, and served as a journalist on the front.  He was present at the republican last stand, the Battle of the Ebro, and was among the British and American journalists who were some of the last to leave the battle, just before the Nationalists dominated the field.  Hemmingway writes as only those who have experienced war can.    On the surface, For Whom the Bell Tolls may appear to be a dated war novel in an age of increasingly abundant graphic literature.  Dig deeper, however, and given time, any reader can appreciate Ernest Hemmingway's distinctive style, and acute attention to detail.  The book is set during the Spanish Civil War--or rather, three days during the entire war.  Hemmingway makes the reader feel as if they are experiencing the hardships that these outnumbered and outgunned freedom fighters endured every minute of each day.  Robert Jordan, the protagonist, is an American dynamiter sent to enlist the assistance of local guerilla forces in the destruction of a bridge controlled by the fascists.  For those not familiar with the Spanish Civil War, it began in 1936 after Francisco Franco toppled the democratic government in Spain.  These conservative and fascist forces came to dominate most of the fighting, due to the aid they received from Nazi Germany.  Three years of brutal fighting ended in the defeat of the republican forces, and the beginning of Franco's dictatorship.  The \\"good guys,\\" in the eyes of a modern audience, did not win.  This is not about the Second World War, or the triumph of good over the forces of darkness.  Darkness comes to dominate all of Spain, and Robert Jordan and the guerillas are not excluded.    Robert Jordan successfully encounters the guerilla forces and lives with them for three days until the time comes for him to embark on his mission to destroy a bridge critical to the fascist forces.  In the opinion of some, For Whom the Bell Tolls may not have enough plot twists or changes of events.  This may be because of Hemmingway's career as a short story writer.  Each scene in this book is incredibly vivid and at times the reader even smells the stew over the fire in the freedom fighter camp--all detail is described.  Perhaps the definitive aspect of Hemmingway's work is the physical layout of the text.  All dialogue is written as if it were literally translated, word for word, from Spanish to English.  Over time, the reader comes to understand Spanish culture and their modus operandi through \\"hearing\\" the language.  This style of writing has a unique impression on the reader, for the reader is placed in the minds of the characters.  Supporting characters that have no major impact on Robert Jordan, are given incredibly detailed backgrounds and each of these side characters are almost as fully developed as the protagonist--Hemmingway's short story writing style has its impact here.  Spend time reading the book, and Hemmingway entirely immerses the reader in the Spanish mountains.  Nothing is left without a vivid description.  The novel has the intensity of a short story.    For those who cannot go through life without categorizing and sticking a label on everything they come across, For Whom the Bell Tolls is an anti-war novel.  No, the `cavalry' does not come riding to the rescue and the surround the innocent `homesteaders' in the end, for the cavalry has been ambushed and slain by a better supplied, better armed, and a better informed foe.  In the end, Robert Jordan realizesthe ultimate futility of his mission to have any impact on the events of war.  He contemplates whether any one person can truly change the course of a battle, and comforts himself with thoughts of his grandfather, who survived the American Civil War.  Jordan seems to wish that he could have made a difference, or that he could live up to his grandfather's achievements. Overall, For Whom the Bell Tolls is a phenomenal book and one that every person should read at some point in their lives.  Its messages about selflessness, futility, and sacrifice are timeless, and the book itself should remain at the top of the charts in this modern age.
B003L5BRXK|5.0|This is one of their funnest albums to listen to and, though it contains a lot of music, has a great pace throughout and never leaves me bored.  For those of you new to the Rolling Stones, it took me a decent amount of time to get into their sound and those who feel similarly may not want to jump in with a sprawling album like this.  In fact I still prefer Sticky Fingers and Let it Bleed just barely over this one, so you may want to start with something like those.  But this is still a classic, and a must have for any fan.
1594202842|3.0|Part of me DOES want to give this only 1 star just because I disagree with her parenting style so much but I cannot deny that this was a quick, well written, funny and entertaining read. Can you imagine being the child of TWO YALE PROFESSORS? To get an inside view of that kind of lifestyle was a real treat and I appreciate \\"tiger mom\\" for sharing her story with us. I give it 3 stars for that reason. I wish I could give her more because I did enjoy reading this a lot but... I just can't. If she wrote some other kind of book NOT about parenting or being Chinese or only of interest to academics, I would probably enjoy it a lot and give it 4 or 5 stars.<br /><br />I'm also glad that she didn't snap and beat Lulu bloody with a stick near the end of the book and finally managed to unclench! I grew up in NYC, am a child of immigrants myself, and went to jr high and high school with a lot of Asian kids. I vividly remember one time in 7th grade when I had been glad to get a 70-something (a C) on a test, and the girl who sat next to me, a close Korean friend started CRYING HER EYES OUT because of her grade. At first I thought she must have gotten something awful and wondered how bad it could possibly be and was gobsmacked to find that she was crying because she got an 88 (a B+ or A-!!!) After talking to her about it I realized that some immigrant parents are REALLY PUSHY AND OBSESSIVE when it comes to their kid's grades. It's not just Chinese moms. It's not just my mom. I guess it kind of bothers me that \\"tiger mom\\" keeps going CHINESECHINESECHINESEEE throughout the whole book because it's not just Chinese parents that do this/not all Chinese parents do this/etc etc etc... I mean my mother was like that and I got around her insanity by just hiding all my tests, lying all the time, going to the extent of PRINTING FAKE REPORT CARDS and oh yeah, stopped eating, developed a horrific eating disorder and depression with suicidal ideation. I haven't talked to my \\"tiger mom\\" (actually I have a different animal in mind for her but I'm afraid it would be impolite to use that word here) in over 12 years.<br /><br />So yeah... \\"tiger mom method...\\" not for me. I think if any moms are actually reading this thing to get parenting advice, the best thing to do might just be to hand the book to your kid and say \\"Aren't you glad I'm not like this?\\"<br /><br />On the other hand, if your kids really do have talent and passion for something, helping them and pushing them is a nice thing to do, but not to the point where you make them miserable.<br /><br />Good luck to the Chua family, thank you for letting us into your lives and I wish you all success in the future!!a different animal in mind for her but I'm afraid it would be impolite to use that word here) in over 12 years.

0385751893|1.0|I read this book for a homeschooling class with my son...and unfortunately, this book was regrettably poor. Bruno, the German 9 year-old boy protagonist, is extremely naive and it almost seems he is completely unaware of anything going on around him besides his own pursuits. He is the son of a Nazi commandant, and yet he still thinks his father is being a great soldier and managing a \\"fun\\" work camp at Auschwitz, which lies just beyond their new home. He even thinks a cafe, hotels, restaurants, shops, etc. exist at the camp. There are also a number of factual errors in this book, starting with the fact that for over a year he goes successfully unseen meeting with a 9 year-old Jewish boy, Shmuel, at the far side of the concentration camp fence. In reality there were Nazis guarding all perimeters around the camp and no such meetings would have been possible to conduct without being spotted. Additionally, anyone who could not work - mostly all children, like Shmuel (with the exception of Mengele's children) - were immediately killed upon arriving at the camp. Bruno climaxes his nativity with thinking things like Shmuel could visit him \\"on holiday, when the camp ends\\" and that in the final chapter - spoiler alert - he thinks that herding the prisoners into the gas chamber is a temporary shelter until a thunderstorm passes.     Overall, I would not recommend this book as very worthwhile to read. There are much better Holocaust historical fiction novels that capture the significance of what happened a lot more accurately and correctly then this book. However, though, we did rent the movie adaption of the book and found it to be much better portrayed than the book itself - excellent acting, more realism, and less naivety.

I had the feelings the author realized she had enough material for another installment (book), but had committed to finishing the series with this 3rd book. So in a sense the final book seemed a little rushed and compacted...there was more to tell, but it just didn't make it to the printed page.<br /><br />2.)And as much as I loved this series...I'm glad it's over! Don't misunderstand, I loved the main protagonist, Katniss, but I wonder if the author 'closed' off this series rather quickly because she, like me, was becoming tired of her heroines rather fragile personality; a personality that was rather schizoid, immature, constantly self-analyzing and full of self-depreciating logic. Towards the end of this third book, I found my self getting weary and apprehensive when Katniss would launch into another of her diatribes directed either toward other people or just thinking to herself.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />Despite my 'concerns' mentioned above, I love this entire trilogy. Great writing...an intriguing, action filled, violent story. 3 1/2 to 4 Stars for this book...5 Stars for the series.<br /><br />Ray Nicholsononclusion:  Despite my 'concerns' mentioned above, I love this entire trilogy.

B000XR4OC0|1.0|I also bought a pair of these shoes because I thought they would go to a good cause. How stupid I was to believe that a shoe that looked like that would hold up at all.. They lasted maybe just over a month before they feel apart and started to get holes in them. I had to find a shoe that would go well in my work enviroment and I wore them every day because thats what shoes are made for. After a few days they started to get very uncomfortable. I HATED THEM. It's horrible to think what the needy children think of them. They need shoes that will actually last if you walk around for long periods at a time and NOT fall apart. I do have to say that it was a great scam on TOMS part. I will never buy such a crappy shoe again.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|When you ask film geeks what is the one film they absolutely love but that they could never watch again, Darren Aronofsky's Requiem For a Dream is either the first to be mentioned or lies amidst the top five.  I normally don't keep note of who directs what picture - that's just not the type of film geek I am.  But with this film, Aronofsky became a household name for me in much the same way that Edgar Wright did, and it is because of the brilliance of both men that my ears will perk up whenever I hear of new work being released by each of them.<br /><br />This may sound cliche, but it's true: Requiem stays with you long after you've seen the film.  I for one can say that it will stay with me for life, whether or not I ever choose to watch it again, which is something I desperately both want and don't want to do.<br /><br />Many critics say that Requiem is a film about drug addiction, but it is so much more than that.  Cole Smithey perhaps put it best: \\"[Requiem] is a movie about drug addiction, but that's only where the plot resides so the thoroughly drawn characters can work toward their imperfect dreams.\\"  Exactly.  Drug addiction is at the heart of the story, but Requiem is really about how quickly potential can decay into grit, and how quickly things can unravel when desperation makes you sacrifice everything past, present, and future for even just a glimpse of leaving your s***ty life behind once and for all.<br /><br />Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto), the son to Ellen Burstyn's Sara, is in love with the beautiful Marion (Jennifer Connelly), an aspiring fashion designer. Marlon Wayans is Tyrone, Harry's best friend, and these three kids believe that their next \\"big score\\" will allow them finally to leave their Coney Island homes behind for \\"the better life.\\"  Of course, we know that this will never end well, especially as the kids' use of their supply increases and where they will find their next hit rises in importance.<br /><br />While the events that play out in the lives of the younger three as the movie unfolds are tragic enough, it is Sara's story that, when pinned up next to the others', adds extra weight to what was already pretty weighty material. Sara is, arguably, the character for whom most people's hearts break the hardest, probably because we can see our own moms, or someone we equally care about, in her place.<br /><br />Sara's demise begins when she receives a phone call wherein she is told that she has been chosen to be a guest on her favorite game show. She sees this as a reason to live and begins taking pills to help her fit back into the dress she wore at Harry's graduation, the one her late husband loved so much.  We realize that this is obviously just a scam call, but it means everything to poor Sara.  Which makes it all the more upsetting each time she checks the mailbox, and there's no invite to the show.<br /><br />This movie is the personification of hitting rock bottom, and I don't mean when you're down in the dumps because your boyfriend broke up with you, or when it was raining outside when you wanted to go to the beach.  No, Requiem captures the kind of sadness and utter helplessness of the death of a child, followed by the death of the relationship that can't survive the death of the child, then the foreclosure and ultimate homelessness that results because you're too depressed to work.  Yeah, that kind of depression.  Dark? Yes, but then, so is Requiem for a Dream.  If you've never seen it, you need to know what you're getting yourself into.<br /><br />You may be asking why you should even bother seeing a film that will make you feel so much like s***, and the best and simplest answer I can give you is because it is a complete masterpiece.<br /><br />Because of Leto's performance in this film, I have complete faith that he will not screw up The Joker in the upcoming Justice League film.  I had never before heard of Burstyn or Connelly, but they earned my respect at first watch with the downright incredible performances they put out here.  Same goes for Wayans.  While I had heard of him previously, I knew him for his comedy, and he is an entirely different actor here, like a split personality.<br /><br />Requiem is a novel adaptation, the book authored by Hubert Selby, Jr., and this is one of those rare cases where the film was able to make its source material all the more haunting with its eerie imagery and unsettling score.<br /><br />Speaking of the score, by Clint Mansell and the Kronos Quartet, I read an interesting piece of trivia in that the film's main theme, Lux Aeterna, was slowly inserted more and more into each song on the soundtrack to essentially warn you that danger was coming.  Once you hear Lux Aeterna in all of its delicious glory (because it is delicious, despite being the darkest piece on the album), that's when you know that all hope is gone, that there's no going back, and that our characters have hit bottom.<br /><br />Requiem's soundtrack will ear-worm its way into your mind and lay eggs there for days. Per the film's Wikipedia page, the pieces here are notable for being so adept at making normally softer sounding instruments sound colder, harsher, and uninviting.  I can second this.  While I guess a violin could be considered a softer sounding instrument, Psycho has certainly shown us that the instrument can have two faces.  Requiem does a good job of backing up that claim.<br /><br />Words cannot do this film justice. What can, however, are its 2,000 cut scenes (in a film that would normally receive a treatment of between 500-600), its performances that redefine the term \\"gut-wrenching,\\" its haunting score, its heartbreaking plot, and the power of the hold it will have on you, a hold that you won't be free from until long after you've forgotten the film.

0307455874|4.0|I read Obama's book \\"Dreams of My Father\\" in 2009 and finished it in Kenya. It was a great book and provided personal insight into a politician which is rarely seen.  This book was instructive about American culture and the challenges facing the world's largest economy where individualism transcends the common good. Here in Australia we struggle to understand how a country as prosperous as USA can argue against the provision of universal health care for its citizens. Obama provides insight into the American psyche and culture which explains how the richest nation on earth leaves so many of its citizens behind. His analysis of public debate is excellent and explains the polarity in US politics and the decline in cooperation between the Democrats and Republicans who have taken politics to a winner take all approach, rather than what is for the public good. He covers a range of policy issues and clearly poses the challenges that America faces in foreign policy, race relations, family issues and a number of other major areas of public policy.  Obama writes from a personal perspective and provides examples of how issues of race, family and foreign policy relate to him and then expands it to the macro level.  It is rare for a politician to be so open and honest in a personal way.  America is in good hands with a president like Obama. Many could learn from him.
B000I2J6K0|4.0|Erin O'Brien is heavily pregnant in this video, and so am I- but I had trouble doing the moves and transitioning as quickly as she did. I chalk it up to my being taller and less fit, whereas she is obviously fit and one of the shorter \\"firecracker\\" types! However, I just attempted each move at my own pace, and paused the video when I needed to. I really enjoyed that she gets your heart rate up and challenges you to \\"keep it up, you're okay!\\"  I find too many of the other prenatal vids are too slow and only focus on stretching or yoga-based movements. Pregnant women still (with their doctor's consent) need to do sustained and safe cardio!  She advises during the workout that if you're panting or can't talk through a sentence, you need to slow down. Overall, a great 40 minute routine that emphasizes legs, arms, back and core, plus a good warmup/ cooldown and stretching.
0060920084|1.0|I admit that I did not read this book in its entirety - about 1/4 of the way through the pages, I could no longer fight my urge to throw the book across the room. When the book met the floor, the spine crushed under the weight of Mr. Bryson's negativity.    If you are interested in (and/or originally from) small town America, be prepared to sit through the most random set of cynicism that I have come across in recent years. It is clear that Mr. Bryson has not one, but instead has multiple chips on his shoulder. One wonders why he even decided to tour small-town America when he obviously could not get over his apparent distaste for anything mildly different than he had previously experienced.    When he wasn't making fun of the 'locals', he was snidely commenting on their economic status, their history (none of which appeared to be relevant to the book)or their accents.    I am originally from the Midwest, and even though I have determined that it is not the place that I wish to live for the rest of my life, I see far more that is positive about the area than negative. That's the thing about perspective, which is typically what moving away from a location will give you. Unfortunately the author offers nothing in terms of perspective, and instead only hoists the antagonistic prose down the reader's throat.
B0000029GA|5.0|This is the rap and hip hop music that I enjoy listening to. Highly skilled rhymes, simple beats and a story to tell. Nas does all this with such flair and skill that it's easy to just sit back and let the majesty of this album show its brilliance right infront of you. If I was going to take one album to a person to try and show them how good rap can be, this would the record.
B0015DROBO|5.0|This series is like the crack rock of avid mystery fans... Once you take a hit (or turn a page in this case) you are hooked. It's simply tragic that this talented writer has been taken from us.  If you need eight hours of sleep a night, don't read this unless you can finish it in one day!!!
B002ZHKZEM|5.0|Fortunately, the creative team led by Russell T. Davies had an opportunity to wrap up thier work on the series in a meaningful manner.  I will miss David Tennant as the Doctor, as well as the writing/producing team.  I will keep my few disappointments out, spoilers.  If you have enjoyed the new run of Dr. Who, you will undoubtably enjoy this collection of specials as well.
B000FC1MCS|5.0|I was unsure of what to expect with this novel, but I ended up loving it.<br /><br />I can't claim to know or understand the circumstances of autism, but I felt this novel seemed authentic.<br /><br />Beyond that, it's a very thoughtful story of a young, curious boy.

B003YFIUW8|4.0|There are true stories similar to the premise of Room, and Emma Donoghue does a thoughtful job of exploring and considering what it must be like for the people in these circumstances.<br /><br />The story is compelling, and I was eager for the characters to prevail.<br />Sometimes I thought the plot was a little too far-reaching, and setting up a for a \\"cleaner\\" ending than a story like this might really have.
B004B32532|5.0|Very interesting movie.  Not your typical 'Hollywood movie'.  I have a large collection of foreign movies and this is in the top 10%.  Most of the actors were unknowns or 'extras' from the shooting scene but they were excellent.  This movie was much better than his previous movies.  It is a murder mystery movie so there are some 'bloody scenes' which may offend some.  The documentary in the extra section was just as interesting as the movie itself.
B000FA5TTW|4.0|The most interesting thing about this novel was it written from a fresh perspective.<br /><br />At times, I felt the plot was losing it's way...but maybe that's the reality of a situation and experience like this.
1579128149|5.0|XXXXX<br /><br />\\"The periodic table is the universal catalogue of everything you can drop on your foot...The Earth, this book, your foot--everything tangible--is made up of elements.  [An element is a substance whose nuclei contain a specific number of protons]...Elements have two faces: their pure state, and the range of chemical compounds they form when they combine with other elements...In this book I try to show both faces of every element...<br /><br />I started collecting elements in 2002...Thanks in part to eBay...by 2009, I had assembled nearly 2300 objects representing every element...Element collecting isn't a big hobby...Compared to [other collecting hobbies], we element nuts are few and far between.\\"<br /><br />The above is found in the introduction and conclusion of this unique book by Theodore Gray.  Gray is a science author, science magazine columnist, and the proprietor of periodic table dot com.<br /><br />This book is based on seven years of research and photography.<br /><br />How many people or even scientists can boast that they have actually seen all of the chemical elements in their pure form, not combined with other elements?  This is what makes this book unique.<br /><br />Most of the pages of this book are composed of a double-page spread of each of the elements.<br /><br />On the left page of each double-page spread is a large photograph of the pure element (where physically possible) along with the element's chemical symbol and atomic number.  (An element's atomic number is the number of protons found in the nucleus of every atom of that element.)  You can see what I mean by looking at the cover of this book (displayed above by Amazon).  Here there are seventeen pure elements displayed just as they appear in the book.  (Actually the pictures in the book are much larger).<br /><br />For example if you look at the top row of elements displayed on this book's cover, you'll come across an element every organism on Earth is familiar with, namely oxygen.  It's chemical symbol, as shown, is O.  It's atomic number is 8.  (This information is commonly written as \\"Oxygen (8)).\\"  What really stands out is the picture of oxygen which is pale blue.<br /><br />You might be saying to yourself, \\"What's this guy talking about!  The colour of the oxygen I breathe in has no colour.\\"  That's true for oxygen gas.  But liquid oxygen (\\"LOX\\") is actually a beautiful pale blue.<br /><br />On the right page of each double-page spread is \\"examples of the ways that element lives in the world--compounds and applications that are especially characteristic of it.\\"  As well, there is brief text describing interesting aspects of the element.<br /><br />On the right page is also a column showing selected physical properties (such as atomic weight, density, and atomic emission spectrum) of the element.  The explanation and definitions of these physical properties are explained at the beginning of the book.  (In fact, there is much explanatory material at the book's beginning that should be carefully read so as to enjoy the rest of the book.)<br /><br />Note that in this book the elements are presented in sequential atomic number order beginning with Hydrogen (1), Helium (2), Lithium (3), Beryllium (4), and so on.  The double-spreads for each separate element end at the element with atomic number 100, named Fermium .  A few elements that have many applications (such as Gold, Iron, and Copper) have a second double-page spread.<br /><br />Elements Mendelevium (101) to Meitnerium (109) have one double-page spread devoted to them as do elements Darmstadtium (110) to Ununoctium (118).  (Note that \\"Ununoctium\\" is a temporary placeholder name only.  Also, this element is, at the time of writing of this book, the last one discovered.)<br /><br />I almost missed this since there is no table of contents with this book.  At the very back is a \\"picture\\" periodic table (that has no atomic weights).  You can tear this out.  In my case, I just didn't have the heart to tear it out of this beautiful book.<br /><br />Finally, I wish the author had included for every element the element's date of discovery and country of discovery.  (To be fair, he does mention these for a few elements.)  I would also have liked to know the number of stable isotopes for each element.  (An isotope of an element has the same number of protons, but a different number of neutrons.)<br /><br />In conclusion, this book is a rare combination of hard science and photographic artistry.  Question: Who is this book for??  Answer: It is for every sentient creature in the universe.  Personally, this book deepened my appreciation of the chemical substances that make up me and the world!!<br /><br />(first published 2009;  quotation and introduction;  the periodic table as a whole;  the major groups of the periodic table;  how the periodic table got its shape;  explanations and definitions of the physical properties presented for each element;  elements with atomic numbers 1 to 100;  elements with atomic numbers 101 to 109;  elements with atomic numbers 110 to 118;  conclusion: the joy of element collecting;  main narrative 235 pages;  bibliography;  acknowledgements;  index;  periodic table tear-out poster)<br /><br />&lt;&lt;Stephen Pletko, London, Ontario, Canada>><br /><br />XXXXX't have the heart to tear it out of this beautiful book.<br /><br />Finally, I wish the author had included for every element the element's date of discovery and country of discovery.

B004E547D8|1.0|It is not the first time I have bought a blu-ray title in a bare bones edition. I got no extras, just the movie with the highest audio and quality pictures available. And I was more than happy with that. However, with \\"RED\\", a bare bones edition also means NO lossless audio, just your dvd-average dolby digital audio track. And I find this unacceptable. I do not blame Summit for this but Amazon.com. I feel cheated, like a second-class customer or something like it. The movie itself is not great, but it is lots of fun. If you have the money, do not waste it on this edition. Shame on Amazon.com.
B000007492|5.0|I have always liked this band and I finally decided to get a best of collection so I could have all my favorite songs on one CD.
141041678X|5.0|Although this is a children's book, I really enjoyed reading it.  It's basically the next Harry Potter, but with Greek gods instead of witches and wizards.  I went through the whole series in less than a week.  Definitely worth your time.
B0049JPU8A|5.0|I´ve listened to The Script since 2008 and although their first album was great (especially The end where I begin and Before the Worst), Science and Faith is about a thousand times better! There isn´t a bad song on it! I listen to it all the time - I just wish that there were more tracks on it. That´s why I´ve ordered the US version. Not sure about the B.O.B. collaboration, though...I cannot wait to see them live - unfortunately I didn´t manage to get hold of a ticket for their Copenhagen gig this Friday and it´s killing me!
1440503257|1.0|I was perplexed when I received this book as a present. In my opinion it's a clever device by the author to cash in on the Harry Potter franchise. The author obviously has never written a cookbook before - the recipes are overly complicated and wordy. In all it lacks any cohesion as a cookbook bar the hook of Harry Potter. And no pictures - not even vague illustrations to liven it up (I'm assuming copyright issues here ); Rowlings et al have disowned the book and well they should. It is nerdy Potter fan meets amateur cooking hour. One for the fans but not for cooks...
6303921248|5.0|This film adaptation of Pride & Prejudice is brilliant; it far outshines every other adaptation for a variety of reasons. The casting and acting are superb. The script is basically the novel verbatim. This gives the sense that the movie's producers made a point to actually stick to the novel, rather than editing and interpreting and changing things around at will. While some people might not consider this so important, I really appreciated this because I love the book and think it is brilliantly written. Consequently, I was so glad to see how carefully it was adapted here. I never get tired of watching this series. I really can't say enough about how well it was done.
B0014VPFTA|5.0|This is my favorite, I frequently listen to this CD during driving, especially \\"on the road\\" traveling a longer than normal amount of time, e.g., up to 70+ miles from home. Great sound quality.
B0001XALTG|5.0|I love this movie. There's a mix of funny parts and sad parts, and the characters (for the most part) are great. I like the way that the movie is filmed and the soundtrack is GREAT. This movie certainly isn't for everyone, but it's definitely one of my favorites.
0439023521|5.0|Wow.  Literally a book I could not put down.  It's split into 3 sections and after pacing through the first section finished the second 2 in one sitting.  The story has fantastic and real characters, real emotions, real hardship, and never once could I figure out exactly what was going to happen next.  If you enjoyed Harry Potter you will definitely enjoy this!
0679745203|4.0|This novel is very well written, as one would expect from Ondaatje. The four characters are woven together brilliantly and it is an excellent example of Ondaatje's skill in doing this. It's not my favorite of his, but it is still a wonderful book and a great read.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Love it! Hilarious! My family started watching the show together and we just love it! Great service and pretty timely shipping.
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|This a terrible adaptation of an excellent book. I'm not denying that the movie is entertaining to watch, since it is. But it does no justice to the actual book. Granted, I'm comparing with A&E's brilliant adaptation, so it would be hard for any movie to stand up to that. Obviously, this is a shorter movie and necessarily cannot follow the book as closely, which I don't necessarily have a problem with. The real issue that I have with this movie is the incorrect portrayal of the characters, particularly that of Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bingley. Mr. Darcy looks like scruffy slob in much of the movie, which is ridiculous. The worst though is Mr. Bingley. His character is portrayed as stupid throughout the whole movie. While Mr. Bingley is certainly a bit goofy in the book, he is anything but stupid. Here though, the directors or whoever else have made him seem like a bumbling idiot. This is such a shallow interpretation of his character, as if he serves no other purpose in the story besides comedic value, which is preposterous.     Realistically though, this movie was created purely for entertainment and they did do that. I guess I just love A&E's version too much to be satisfied with anything else :) But if you don't have 6+ hours to devote to watching all of that and just want to curl up on the couch and watch a good love story, this one works well :)
1569242739|5.0|I think allot of people will agree that the hardest part of going vegan is not being able to partake in yummy desserts, especially cupcakes! And that was me before I found this cookbook a few years ago. I thought how in the world can I survive without cupcakes. I found this cookbook by chance while I was in a local book store. I opened it up and was sold as soon as I laid eyes on the first cupcake picture. I couldnt believe my cupcake deprived eyes... they were BEAUTIFUL! Page after page of the most beautiful cupcakes that I have ever seen. I wasted no time purchasing the book and then off to the store I went to buy the ingredients. And for an added bonus, everything could be purchased at a regular grocery store, which was a major plus for me since I live about an hour from a Whole Foods store. I was in complete shock how easy it was to make these cupcakes, and even better, how great they tasted. You would never guess the arent the \\"real\\" thing. Everybody LOVES them. My life was now complete, I could eat cupcakes again! This book is a MUST HAVE for a VEGANS. You will not be disappointed.
B0042RJWTM|5.0|If you are a fan of the old west and cowboy lifestyle, you can't do much better than \\"Monte Walsh.\\" Throw in, \\"Will Penny,\\" and you'll have one of the best double features available to enjoy. While there is some gunplay in both films, it's the story and characters that make these two fine western films the hidden gems that they are. These are what the real west was like...
0671027344|5.0|I first read this book in high school, and was blown away. Even though the protagonist is in high school, it is obviously a very adult book. The characters are engaging and sympathetic, and the narrator never stops challenging the reader with his insights. Anyone about to enter high school should be required to read this book, and anyone who has already survived high school with any sort of moral compass in tact.
B004DF3S7A|3.0|When it has came down to Rod Stewart, he has honestly been one of the most iconic, and most influential voice of the past 40 years. On his own, and as a part of The Faces, he delivered some of the strongest songs that've still remained as iconic as the soulful singer. But the past decade, Rod has gone from soulful blue-eyed soul singer, to crooner of the last decade. While it has won his a lot of new fans all over the world, it has unfortunately lost a bit of its luster in what had made Rod Stewart so iconic all these years. While it has nearly been 10 years since Rod Stewart unveiled The Great American Songbook series, and now a new hits collection of Rod's crooner era is finally here. But is it honestly worth the money? Well, not definitively yes and no.<br /><br />The Best Of The Great American Songbook, is a noble reflection of Rod's 5 volumes of The Great American Songbook series from 2002-2010, without the offshoot records, 2009's Soulbook & 2006's Still The Same albums. There are some of Rod's best songs from the series here  including Time After Time, The intimate The Way You Look Tonight, What A Wonderful World with Stevie Wonder on the harmonica, and These Foolish Things to name a few. While there are a lot of good standards here, there honestly is still a lot that could've been covered from his classic duets with Diana Ross of I've Got A Crush On You from Volume IV, and Bewitched, Bothered & Bewildered with Cher from The Great American Songbook Volume II, to some of his recent covers including Frank Sinatra's I've Got You Under My Skin, and a classy rendition of Smokey Robinson & The Miracles, The Track Of My Tears. I just felt there were a lot of good songs that should've been showcased, but yet missed being iconic.<br /><br />All in all, Rod Stewart's The Best Of The Great American Songbook isn't a bad sampler of what made Rod Stewart transform himself brilliantly the past several years, but honestly not enough to make the collection collectively a better buy than all the five Great American Songbook Volumes seperately drive as one. While I have grown with Rod going a customed to his crooner ways, I just felt that there should've been more to follow for die hard fans who've missed what made Rod Stewart so good with covers in the first place.<br /><br />Album Cover: B-<br /><br />Songs: C+<br /><br />Price: B-<br /><br />Remastering: B-<br /><br />Overall: C+the five Great American Songbook Volumes seperately drive as one.

B0041RTE50|4.0|This is a very high budget British comedy.  It's pretty fun to watch but my wife likes it much more than I do.  So far the comedy is centered on \\"Emma\\" who gets herself into trouble by meddling in other peoples business.
0375842209|5.0|The book is all written from the perspective of Death telling a story about the main character.  I really enjoyed the story, though sad.  It really brought a different perspective to what happened durring World War II from the German citizen's point of view.  You see a lot of people reaching their breaking points durring the war and how it all affects them.  It's beautifully written and I couldn't put it down once I started reading it.
B002ZG9940|4.0|The movie was an alright movie, not great, but not bad.  If you are looking for a movie which will pass the time, this one will work.  I like that the setting was in a small Italian village.  Most movies are in larger cities with little scenes in villages, this was the opposit.  Because it is in a small village the movie moves at a slow pace like you was in a small village.  Not much dialog in the movie, which I think hurt the movie some and made it a little slow.  Over all it was an enjoyable movie, if you could take the slow pace of it.
B0012NVGHU|5.0|I heard the soundtrack before ever seeing the movie.  I heard \\"Falling Slowly\\" on the public radio and heard a lot of talk about the movie.  When Swell Season came locally for a concert, I had to sit down and watch to movie.<br /><br />I'm so glad Amazon had it on demand.  I could not find it anywhere!  No rental place had it, no store had it for me to buy.  Amazon really came through so I could download it and watch it.<br /><br />I love the story and the music throughout.  You can really see the chemistry between the two leads, no wonder they had a relationship outside of the movie.<br /><br />Oh, and you have got to love Glen Hansard's accent!

B0034G4P7G|5.0|Oh, boy, oh boy, oh boy, Alan Sorkin has written one of those screenplays that come once in a lifetime David Fincher has directed this marvelous film. How do you portray a nerdy brilliant Harvard student who has little or no social skills?<br /><br />It became apparent that Mark Zuckerberg, the brilliant developer of Facebook, might have Asperger's Syndrome. Brilliance and a remarkable lack of social skills. We are introduced to him when he is in the midst of a discussion with a girl he really likes and she finally gets up and leaves and calls him an 'a**hole'. There you have it, he had no idea he had upset her so, and went on to cause her more anger. Jesse Eisenberg is perfect in the role of Mark Zuckerberg. Off in his own world, but able to snap back in an instant. His story is told in a back and forth between a court disposition and the real world. Eduardo, played by Andrew Garfield, one of Mark's Harvard friends becomes the CFO of this new fledgling site called 'The Facebook'. Along the way there is some confusion surrounding the Winklevoss brothers, Cameron and Tyler both played by Armie Hammer. They are rich kids who believe Zuckerberg stole their \\"Harvard Connection\\" in making Facebook. Of all of the people in this story the Winklevoss brothers come across as real 'a**holes'. Along the way, once Facebook become known we are introduced to entrepreneur, Sean Parker, played by Justin Timberlake. He is one of those men you would like to throw a pie in his face, manipulative, jealous and smirky. Zuckerberg may have had the insight to develop Facebook, but he could not do it alone, and along the way he gets lost at times. He is not interested in money nor the lifestyle of drugs and rock and roll. The dialogue is wonderful, you find yourself rooting for Zuckerberg. A man of great intellect, but little insight into himself and the outside world.<br /><br />This is a wonderfully made film, and I found myself so wrapped up in it. The two hours went by very quickly. Great performances and a film well worth an Academy Award.<br /><br />Highly Recommended. prisrob 02-02-11<br /><br />Adventureland<br /><br />Saturday Night Live the Best of '06/'07 (Widescreen)ces and a film well worth an Academy Award.

1439152780|3.0|I was a little disappointed in this book, because the other ones by her are very good.  It was very disjointed, convoluted,hated the ending.

B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I went to see this film in the theater with several friends. The cast was amazing, the character developement believable. There was never a dull moment from beginning to end. The dialog was extremely clever and it would be a hard job to figure out who was the actual star of the film. John Malkovich was hillarious and loveable (loveable? Malkovich?... yeah!), Bruce Willis delivered his usual sterling performance as a tough guy with a boyish charm, Helen Mirren was perfect as the Martha Stewart of hitwomen, and Morgan Freeman was, as always, an understated yet powerful character.<br />The only thing I would have changed would have been to add at least 30 more minutes to the movie, there was so much action it seemed like the opening credits had just finished when the end credits started rolling.<br />I'm really hoping for a follow up!!!
B0034G4P7Q|4.0|This movie is not about a social network but about some of the people involved in its formation. The story about this phenomenon's formation from the ground up I found to be intriguing but if it was really about the social implications of Facebook and how it deceives people into believing you can have a social life without being around people is another story. Another unintended result is how it can be instrumental in toppling autocratic regimes like the one in Egypt. I bet Zuckerburg never imagined that during his days at Harvard. It's ironic that one of the most socially inept people portrayed in film is its founder.

B002OG5GT8|5.0|I bought this as my first headphone amp to use with a set of UE Triple-fi's I received for Christmas. Made the sound much warmer and when the bass boost is turned on, fuller. Definitely worth the $20, if you have high end head phones you should at the very least have this amp. I just got an e7 amp and highly recommend it as well, what you sacrifice in portability you gain in sound quality, especially if you are listening on a laptop or computer without a high end sound card. I had not considered myself an audiophile, but you owe it to yourself to listen to some music at 96Hz/24Bit with high end headphones and one of these amps.
B002ZG99QS|3.0|If nothing else, 'Tron Legacy' is Sci-Fi eye-candy.  Of course 'Tron Legacy' has some visual appeal that immediately hooks in the audience.  There are discuses which are thrown as weapons in stadium duels between man and machine, artificial crowd cheering, and vehicles that ride in Matrix-like slow-motion arcs that splash wild neon colors in high-tech chase scenes.    There's a trade off that takes place between the original Tron and the sequel, 'Tron Legacy'.  And judging both entities is really a matter of separating the story from the special effects.  (Although taking a movie apart in not an entirely fair way to judge a movie.)    Call me old-fashioned.  Call me clueless, but, while I love how the new visuals' striking appeal, and I really enjoyed how they linked time together by having Flynn's son visit his father's old arcade after he mysteriously disappeared from his Fortune 500 company (as well as rebooting the sequel by having Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner on the screen) the pregnant pauses for narrative and a too-often pensive story-line take away the excitement and urgency found in the primitive original.     Further that with more stagnant and less compelling chase sequences in between, and I thought much of the magic was lost.  The fights in the inner space bar seem lame and familiar--especially if you consider the original 'Star Wars' as the standard.  Chris Pine or Channing Tatum could just have easily taken the part of Sam Flynn (Garrett Hedlund).  This young protagonist, along with a few others were far from a stellar cast, except for Bridges who could play his character with the vitality and looks easily reminiscent of his younger performance--alongside with his aging counterpart, a Zen recluse (a captive to his own technology) and his nemesis/alter ego (Clu).  Olivia Wilde as the heroine, Quorra, doesn't do much for the proceedings either.  Bruce Boxleitner is merely a token memory of the original.    I truly remember the original 'Tron' backin the early eighties.  It transported me to a place I had never been before.  In college video games had invigorated our recreation time with \\"Donkey Kong,\\" \\"Pac-Man,\\" and \\"Centipede,\\" which gave us study breaks and a hefty escape from the pressures of college.  Tron delivered us into that same world in a sustaining way by combining a convincing mix of arcade life and real life.  The visuals and the world created there were both unique and mesmerizing.  By the time the protagonist was brought back to life outside the game, I felt I had been gone a long time.    'Tron Legacy' remains worthy as a minor arcade, a nice milestone party, and a bit of memory filing experience--not unlike a thirty year high school reunion, but, in the end, the film is a forgettable ride that might be worth taking only once.

B002ZG993Q|1.0|I dont know what the good reviews are about, I don't understand exactly what it is these good reviewers saw in this movie, after reading them I was convinced I would like this movie, I didn't even come close to liking it. After the insteresting beginning, where Clooney and his girl are threatened by assasins, I spent the whole movie waiting for something interesting to happen til the credits were shown I got the message that this so called movie was over.      My guess is that the director wanted to portray the lonely life of a veteran hitman and the package that comes with such a life, don't get me wrong the movie is well performed, I just don't agree that this is an interesting way of telling a story.        A lot of people think that with no dialogue, no emotion, not a hint of an interesting plot, that the filmaker is letting the spectator come to its own conclusions, but I wouldn't care reaching conclusions from a dull and pointless storyline as this movie has, and I like the type of movie this director (is my guess) tried to make, but in my opinion he missed the mark completely.       My other guess about the good reviews are what people like to see in this movie, what inspired them just by showing good actors with little dialogue, the fact is that this movie only gets mentioned because Clooney is the main character. So for me watching this movie is as interesting as watching paint dry.

B0042U94UQ|5.0|Okay, I confess.  I'm a 30 something woman with no kids, and my husband and I LOVED this movie.  We've seen it three times in the past two weeks!<br /><br />Universal Studios did an excellent job making a film that will appeal to the masses.<br /><br />Meet Gru - he wants to be a super villain.  He'd love to be the evilest man on earth - but he can't do it alone.  He has Dr. Nefario and the minions...but he also needs the help of 3 orphan girls if he wants to succeed.  The girls bring lots of chaos and humor with them.<br /><br />Some little kids are easily scared by bad guys on screen.  But no worries with this movie.  Gru WANTS to be evil, but he's not, really.  The kids in the movie aren't even afraid of him.  Universal Studios throws in a lot of scenes to make little ones giggle, such as physical comedy, potty humor, and of course those cute little minions.<br /><br />But they don't forget us adults.  The plot is deep enough to hold our interest, and they throw in things that most kids will miss, like simple physics, clever wordplay in English AND Spanish, and amusing details in the background of the action.  There's also a funny scene where Gru moans about how terrible children's books are.<br /><br />The movie pulls at the heartstrings a little, but not so much that it becomes too sweet.  There's always humor at appropriate moments to keep things light.<br /><br />If you have young children, you should definitely watch this movie.  And even if you don't have children, if you enjoyed movies like Monsters Inc., Toy Story, The Incredibles, and Cars - you will want to try this one as well!
B0043EV774|5.0|First saw it in 2D on a rental. It was OK; but, then saw it on blu-Ray 3D on a Panasonic Plazma. Now it was worth seeing. Well done in 3D (don't bother seeing the 2D version).
B000B5MI3Q|5.0|Ordered watch from KG Company fulfilled by Amazon.  Watch came packaged in original Seiko box with all tags, paperwork, etc.  It has ran approximately 5 seconds a day fast out of the box which for my purposes is more than acceptable.  The rubber strap that came with the watch is comfortable but adds considerable thickness around the wrist.  I switched out this band for a nylon strap which I think looks very good on this watch.  All in all a classic, automatic watch at a fair price.
0811870413|5.0|I'm very grateful to Chad Robertson and Eric Wolfinger for reaching deep to convey the secrets of making incredible bread.  The book is remarkable in that it is both textually and visually composed to provide the home baker with extremely helpful and informative step-by-step guidance.  Moreover, Chef Robertson has done an extraordinary job of describing the aromas, textures and moistness that signal readiness for each stage of the process.  Armed with this information, the home baker can confidently identify these key points of transition to ensure success.  He also offers advice on how to correct problems, while sharing imaginative techniques to work around the limits of the home kitchen.  This is book that can take your bread making to a level almost unattainable to home bakers.    That being said, prepare to commit to baking bread for an extended period to gain the knowledge that can only come from experience.  Fortunately, your freinds and family will be supportive because they benefit.  Once you start, you begin to appreciate how carefully this book is composed.  You'll find nuggets of guidance in the text and - all of a sudden - one photo makes the difference between failure and an AHA! moment.      You will need to plan ahead.  Bread for dinner tomorrow requires preparation today.  That takes some practice to anticipate.  You'll also want to invest in some tools: a digital scale, silicone mat, bench knife, flexible scrapper, muslin towels, instant-read thermometer, and large bowls.  These items are not expensive, but make a world of difference.      Lastly, FWIW - the best way to clean up a dry flour mess is your bench knife.  If you use a damp towel or sponge, you'll make glue.  And before you wash out that goopy bowl, use your scrapper to clean it and dump the mess in your garbage or compost.  Plumbers love bakers for a reason.

1599219751|2.0|I was intrigued by this story of a Polish officer taken prisoner by the Russians in 1939 and his amazing journey to freedom by sheer determination and willpower.<br /><br />The book is well written and gripping. It makes the reader appreciate what a human being is actually capable of under extreme conditions.<br /><br />The only problem of this \\"true story\\" is that it is not true at all. Documents surfaced after the fall of the Soviet Union demonstrate that the author was actually liberated by the Soviets a few years after being captured, and transported to a camp in Iran. The escape, as described, simply never happened.<br /><br />This information was published by the BBC after his death, but it is a shame that he falsely claimed having lived through this ordeal, most likely for profit.<br /><br />It is a good read nonetheless, but to me, it was a major letdown, mainly because the title claims \\"The TRUE story.....\\"
0545265355|4.0|Suzanne Collins is a wonderful, easy-to-read author. This series was great and the characters were all interesting. I couldn't put them down!
0312600844|5.0|While in the process of sending my sister (in Minnesota, coincidentally) a copy of \\"Freedom\\" I thought I would read a few Readers Comments. I was stunned to see so many less-than-(5)stellar reviews. Rather than reading the favorable reviews, I start where I usually start with an Amazon purchase: by reading all of the one-star reviews.<br />I simply don't get it. \\"Freedom\\" is on my short-list of all-time favorite novels. I was especially amazed by comments by readers who seemed to not appreciate Franzen's character portraits. Every one of the characters resonated with me. These were people I knew in the time period in which the novel was set. Franzen's skill as a writer is stunning. I found myself constantly re-reading certain phrases that were often laconic but never embittered. I began to read more slowly, trying to extend the pleasure that I thought would end on the last page. However, I find that weeks later the pleasure remains.<br />My only explanation of how I could be so gratified and yet many others be so disappointed is that I believe that many readers simply did not 'Get It'. \\"Freedom\\" works on so many levels. It is an elegy of a recent time now disappeared. It is a book of separation, forgiveness and redemption. It is hugely ambitious but finely crafted and a joy to read out-loud. Above all, it is a very kind and knowing book. Yes, the characters are iconic in some blurred way, but this is not a morality play. Franzen weaves his characters through a changing time, takes them...anti-heroes all, mires them with their individual shares of human imperfection, lets them crash, then lifts them up, one at a time with transcendent plotting and writing. Reminiscent of F.Scott Fitzgerald and every bit as good. Six-Stars!

0823015033|5.0|I only recently discovered polymer clay, and had so far only made a few beads, and a few failed attempts at simple animal sculptures.  I wanted to attempt figure sculptures, but I had absolutely no experience with anything like that. After looking through all the books available, I chose this one, primarily because the figures were more realistic and life-like than some of the other books available.<br /><br />Choosing this book was one of the best decisions I've ever made.<br /><br />I got the book on a Saturday afternoon, and on Sunday sat down with it and began working on my first face.  In a few hours I had a figure head completed that amazed me - it was incredibly realistic and life-like.  It looked like a real person.  Even I hadn't expected such advanced results on my first project.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong - it's not perfect, and I still have a lot to learn and practice.  I expected that - but what I didn't expect was for my very first piece to be that good.  While it's possible I have some previously unknown skill for sculpting (though it's certainly never shown up before this), I give most of the credit to this book - because the instructions are so incredibly detailed that if you pay attention, do what it says, and take your time, you can't go wrong.  You CAN learn to make beautiful, life-like figures in clay.<br /><br />The book starts out with a good overview of different clays, so you can make an informed choice in that regard.<br /><br />Then the author shows you how to make every tool you'll need to complete a figure as she describes the process.  You would need to buy only a few simple and inexpensive things, some of which you might already have on hand.  It's wonderful to be able to create such beautiful things without having to spend a fortune on specialized tools.<br /><br />I was too impatient to make all the tools before I dived into attempting the sculpting, so I made my first head and face sculpture with nothing but a couple of knitting needles, a craft knife, and a needle which I already had on hand.  Astounding what you can do with clay using a knitting needle.  But having gotten that out of my system, I do intend to make the simple tools she describes, as I can see how valuable they will be.<br /><br />After those chapters, the author gets right into the meat of the book - teaching you how to make the figures.  The instructions are incredibly detailed and precise, even down to measuring exactly how much clay to use for each part - which may seem tedious at first, but getting proportions right is one of the hardest parts of creating a realistic figure, and this takes the guesswork out of that, until you build your skill enough to be able to 'eyeball' proportions on your own.<br /><br />But none of that means you're going to turn out cookie cutter figures that all look alike. The author also gives you the information you need to customize and personalize each figure you create.  She gives a lot of information about the differences in sculpting male and female figures, and different ethnic features, creating figures at different ages, and giving the face different expressions, from happy to sad or angry.  This combined with your own creativity and willingness to experiment would enable you to make any type of figure you could imagine.<br /><br />The book is filled with detailed pictures and diagrams, so you don't have to guess at what you need to do for a particular step.  The background information on anatomy is just enough to make sense and help you, without getting so detailed your eyes glaze over and you give up.<br /><br />The book also provides detailed information to make figures in 4 different sizes, and plenty of information on clothing your figure, adding hair, and other embellishments for a beautiful, complete finished figure.<br /><br />To sum up:  Sculpting is a skill that takes time to learn, but with your own patience and willingness to work at it, this book will give you all of thefoundation information you could ever need to make beautiful figure sculptures.

The character build-ups were simply immaculate and the story line was just fabulous.  I literally loaded this book to my kindle last night at 6 o'clock...and i've already finished it by 1:30 this afternoon!!! and i'm SO sad it's over.  It was such a great read.  Needless to say I cannot WAIT to read more of Sophie Kinsella's work!!!!

0470913029|5.0|This is the most common sense book on dieting available. Humans have survived for millions of years without the industrialized / modern diet. The Paleo diet explains why humans should not eat grain-based products, food additives, preservatives, and genetically modified foods.

A must read for anyone looking to clean up their diet and their life and find optimal health and wellness.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|The overall quality of this movie is stunning. The visuals, the nonstop action, and the hunger-inducing food theme all made this a treat to watch. I even got the urge to cook my very first omelette after the movie was over. (It was somewhat edible.) Even the extras were rather charming.    The one thing that keeps me from rating this as a 5 is the characterization. It gave the movie a depressing overtone, as most of the characters' personalities are overdone and don't have very many redeeming qualities. Linguini is a massive dope, Colette is an ice queen with a penchant for stabbing knives through shirt sleeves when she wants to be intimidating (who defrosts only partially by the end of the movie), the head chef is a raving lunatic who acts about ready to brandish a couple of extra large, extra sharp knives of his own, and the rest of the characters are just... grim. Remy and his family are at least realistic. They're kind, and actually act sane towards each other.
0385342039|5.0|What I love about Sophie Kinsella's writing is that her heroines are always full of life and spark. Their thoughts tend to run wild but never off on tangents and they always seem to get themselves into hilarious situations. It's always a fun adventure when I pick up a Sophie Kinsella book, whether it is Lexi Smart who can't remember the past 3 years of her life or Lara Lington who thinks she gone mad because she's being haunted by her Great Aunt Sadie.<br /><br />Twenties Girl is a bit different from other Kinsella books, this way, because not only is there a vibrant pinch of the paranormal in this contemporary chick-lit but also two heroines taking us for a ride. From the moment Sadie enters Lara's life there is no doubt that these two ladies are very different. Lara's life isn't going the way she wants it. Still pining for her boyfriend after an abrupt split (over email) and in a business that is going down the drain, after being abandoned by the best friend who talked her into the business in the first place, the last thing she needs is to be haunted by a woman who likes to scream to get her way. A woman who only Lara can see or hear and who convinces Lara to stop her own body from being cremated until Lara can find her necklace.<br /><br />Sadie is a wild spit fire and although she died at a hundred and five she's always felt like a twenty three year old and that's how she looks and acts while always dressed in a fabulous twenties frock. Sadie loves fashion, lovers, and dancing and as for love? She says she doesn't believe in it.<br /><br />With sprinkles of humour, charm, romance, and wild antics Twenties Girl was a very quick read that reminded me of the value of friendship, family, and love, and of living your life beautifully without fear.<br /><br />If I want to nitpick I will say that there were moments when I wanted to strangle both girls - Sadie so I could shut up her incessant screaming and Lara because she would not see the truth when it was shouting her in the face.<br /><br />A great pair who clashed and bonded all through this book I couldn't help but feel sad to say goodbye to Lara and Sadie when I read the last page.who clashed and bonded all through this book I couldn't help but feel sad to say goodbye to Lara and Sadie when I read the last page.
B003ZDZ1WG|4.0|The CD was brand new and in perfect condition.  The only downfall was that it was pretty slow to ship.  It took about 2 weeks to receive it, but I wasn't in a hurry to get it.  Therefore, it was no problem for me, but something to keep in mind....
0061474355|5.0|I'm happy that I got to read this book again after so long. It has been years since I read Sabriel and although I remembered a lot I had also forgotten a lot so it was refreshing to reread it. I found this book to be a story rich with fantasy and magic. Garth Nix really does know how to create a unique world filled with brilliant detail and his heroine Sabriel was a young woman I couldn't help but admire greatly. I don't read much high fantasy and I am going to guess that this is the type of story Sabriel was so the writing at times went a bit over my head and I had to stop myself and read over a paragraph or page more slowly so I could know what I was learning or what was happening but for the most part I enjoyed Garth Nix's eloquent and descriptive writing style.<br /><br />My favourite characters would have to be Mogget the dangerous and cheeky cat who found it very easy to make one feel like an idiot but who's advice and aid were greatly valued, and Sabriel who was an intelligent girl not prepared for the world she was thrust into but not running away from it either. I read a review where someone said that in high fantasy they tend to find women who are damsels in need of saving or warrior women and that Sabriel was neither of these. I don't how true that is with concern of your typical females found in high fantasy but I did appreciate that Sabriel not only thought like a young lady (raised in a boarding school) but she was also a very able bodied sword fighter and a great necromancer or specifically Abhorsen.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the relationship between her and Touchstone, it wasn't that of rescuer and rescuee (not a word right?) but equals standing side by side ready to give help to the other when it was needed.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|I can't believe some of the negative comments regarding this cd!  This is definitely a great album showing a different side to josh's  superb voice!  Stand out tracks for me are Hidden away, Galileo (Someone Like You), Higher window    Give it a try! You won't be dissapointed!
B003XKPPOU|4.0|This movie was very well animated as usual and it had many great moments.  Our problem was that we watched it with our 2 and 5 year old kids and there a few different scenes that were just too intense for them.  My 5 year old daughter, who is admittedly pretty emotional, ran from the room in tears at least once.  She came back and we finished the movie, so I thought it was a temporary thing.  But a couple weeks later I suggested we watch it again when some cousins were over and she yelled out, \\"Mom said I never had to watch that show again!\\" and was upset.  Anyway, YMMV but just be warned that this movie might be too intense for young kids, which I assumed was the target market.  By the way, they both loved both of the other Toy Story movies.

B004132HZS|5.0|When I first bought the original books, this title was recommended to me. I have to say I'm glad it was. The episodes stay as true to the original stories that they are based on. The changes they made are ones that are deemed necessary and also quite humorous at times. For any fans of mystery or Sherlock Holmes himself, buy this set. It is a very good show and I can't wait until the next season comes out.

The idea behind it is genius.  Every time she describes the \\"symptoms\\" of love I think back to a time that I experienced them.  I think that the age has a lot to do with it because I believe that love is more real and all encompassing when you are in the late teens more than any other time in your life.<br /><br />There was nothing about this novel that was not thought out and fully expressed in my opinion.  I did not feel like I was reading a Young Adult novel, I felt like I was reading the journal of a friend.  I felt for her; scared, vulnerable, angry, sad, happy, love, wonder and fear.  Lena felt exactly as I think I would have if I had been in her place.  I could only hope that I would be as brave as she turns out to be.<br /><br />There have been and are going to be reviews of this one everywhere so I do not want to tell you what happens.

I sometimes wonder if you all think I do not actually read the books I review! I promise that I do, but to tell you what happens is to take away the joy of reading it, and with this book especially, that would be a tragedy.  I would challenge you to not even read the synopsis!

B0015DROBO|3.0|While I was reading Stieg Larsson's `The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,' I found myself constantly in a position of setting the book down and saying to myself: \\"Eww.\\" This book is not for the faint of heart. There are repulsive graphic scenes the make you cover your eyes (but then you realize your reading a book and not watching a movie, and that the story doesn't go on unless you keep looking). Larsson attempts to draw our attention towards the horrific occurrences of sexual abuse and violence towards women, and masterfully accomplishes his task by making you feel weak in the knees and warping your mind into thinking you need a bath regardless of your cleanliness.<br /><br />That being said, Larsson weaves a story with painstaking detail to food, technology, cars and coffee, and cannot be read unless you have a family tree of the characters at your fingertips. But even though the protagonists are not the most likable people to support and cheer for, the addicting mystery will have you turning page after page, even if your stomach squirms with each graphic scene.<br /><br />On a 5 level book shelf, 5 being the best/highest it goes on shelf number 2.

B003Q6D27S|2.0|After surviving the RBT that Jill Tuck (Betsy Russell) so elegantly placed on his head at the end of \\"SAW 6\\", and with an entire police force now after him, Jigsaw's protegee Detective Mark Hoffman (Costas Mandylor), who has the uncanny ability of healing from an electric shock and facial mutilations rather quickly, decides to even out the score. He wants Jill dead but she has gone to the police and in exchange for information, seeks police protection. Meanwhile a dishonest Bobby Dagen (Sean Patrick Flanery), a proclaimed Jigsaw trap survivor who is capitalizing on his experience, is put through a series of gruesome tests. If you've seen any of the previous films, you know the traps are set to a timer and if not completed in time, the unfortunate victim will meet an unpleasant demise. More of the same? Yes. But considering this is the final film in the franchise, I was expecting a lot more.<br /><br />In regards to the gore, the film delivers the goods. Yes, the gore and grisly deaths are here in abundance so gore-hounds will not be bored and the squimish will most likely be sick to their stomachs.  The film also boasts in having the most traps of any SAW film. I originally saw this film in the theatres in 3-D and felt the 3-D effects were under utilized. Watching it on the small screen I wondered why they even bothered filming this in 3-D at all and many have already complained about the fake looking blood which looked good on the big screen, on DVD ... not so much.<br /><br />Now, as mentioned previously, since this is supposed to close out the series, I was expecting a lot and my expectations were firmly set high. What I got was an all too familiar premise and some very unfortunate character developments thanks to the not so clever writers. My biggest beef with this sequel is with the treatment of 2 key characters: Jill Tuck and Detective Mark Hoffman.<br /><br />I had grown fondly attached to the character of Jill. Her character in previous films, SAW 6 being the exception, did not get much screen time but from the few seconds you saw of her you knew that she was somehow involved in Jigsaw's warped game. Her wicked smile, her cool and detached demeaner gave her an air of arrogance and yet she remained an enigma. There was a self confidence to her that convinced me that if there was anyone capable of outsmarting Hoffman, it would be her. There was an opportunity here to fully flesh out her character but instead the writers decided to turn on her and transform her from a slick, detached babe who oozed mystery and quiet malice to a whimpering idiot and a damsel in distress. Prior to this film, there was a build-up to her character but the writers decided to use her as a prop and went the other direction. Detective Hoffman, on the other hand, reaches his final transformation here into HE-MAN.. or \\"The Terminator\\" .. or maybe 007? His character became a caricature of ludicrous proportions, a Rambo-esque powerkiller who is able to annihilate the world using his mad skills and a knife. Really?<br /><br />Judging by the reaction from those I saw this with and by public reviews, \\"SAW 3-D\\" or \\"The Final Chapter\\" is definitely receiving a mixed reaction. I most definitely hated it and purchased it simply for completing my SAW DVD collection but in my heart of hearts... my true final chapter is \\"SAW 6\\". This installment is disappointing on many levels. Instead of giving us a satisfying conclusion, the writers got a little lazy and gave us a more of the same by-the-numbers sequel. It was predictable, the dialogue was cheesy and the final twist was something that was predicted years ago. Watch it for the never-ending gore and the elaborate traps but don't expect much else. Game Over? I should hope so...unless they find a clever way of resurrecting the series and finally give us a proper closure.et much screen time but from the few seconds you saw of her you knew that she was somehow involved in Jigsaw's warped game.

B001GA1RFA|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Colin haas had many pitfalls when looking for love & you are happy when he suceeds. I great read! :)
B004EQAVHI|5.0|Never Let Me Go left me speechless.  I am not at all surprised by the hype this movie has accumulated.  The acting is fantastic and the plot is heart-wrenching.  I loved everything about this movie, the setting, the characters, the direction, all of it is an amazing film.  Never Let Me Go is a must-see for all movie-lovers.
0525951652|5.0|The book I received was in excellent condition. The delivery time was prompt. Would definitely buy from this vendor again. Go for it.
B0032JTV6U|5.0|Glee season 1 is an amazing sit-com. I love it from the beginning to the end. If you have a gray and sad day, spice it up with some glee, you will not be dissapointed !
B000V1Y43W|4.0|It's a little thin on story, but the characters are so charming and the visuals so dazzling that it's hard to knock this movie. PLUS ... it holds my nephew's attention every time we watch it together, and that's saying something. Now if only I could stop him from saying the lines out loud; he's memorized the whole thing.<br /><br />I grew up in an era in which cartoons were pure fun ... Looney Tunes stuff, that kind of thing. Lots of modern animation doesn't grab me. This film did.
B0016116A0|5.0|In trying to sort out some mp3s I have, I find that the 10 mp3s listed and for sale here are not as those listed for the CD, \\"Strauss: Four Last Songs / Wagner: Wesendonck-Lieder [Original recording remastered, Import]\\"  The first 4 tracks indeed are surely the Four Last Songs, but at least some of the final 6 tracks are NOT by Wagner but also by Strauss, at least the Opus 27 pieces, judging from what I've just found at Wikipedia:  \\"..., track 8, \\"Ruhe, meine Seele, Op.27, No.1\\" and Wikipedia says, \\"Ruhe, meine Seele!, Op. 27 No. 1, is the first in a set of four songs composed by Richard Strauss in 1894. It was originally for voice and piano, and not orchestrated by Strauss until 1948, after he had completed one of his Four Last Songs \\"Im Abendrot\\".[1] The words are from a poem \\"Ruhe, meine Seele\\" written by the poet Karl Henckell.\\"      Elsewhere Wikipedia says, \\"The other songs of Strauss' Opus 27:  Op. 27 No. 2 \\"Cäcilie\\" (Wenn du es wüßtest)  Op. 27 No. 3 \\"Heimliche Aufforderung\\" (Auf, hebe die funkelnde Schale)  Op. 27 No. 4 \\"Morgen!\\" (Und morgen wird die Sonne wieder scheinen)\\"    My tracks were labeled by Gracenotes, and the final 6 each is labeled \\"Orchesterlieder:\\"  Consistent w this, Wikipedia cites this book:  \\"Jackson, Timothy L. \\"Ruhe, meine Seele! and the Letzte Orchesterlieder\\" in \\"Richard Strauss and his World\\", ed. Bryan Gilliam. Princeton University Press, 1992.\\"    In summary, the mp3s appear to be properly labeled, but are not the same as those listed on the CD.  Probably a better name for this mp3 collection than \\"Strauss, R.: Four Last Songs, etc. by Jessye Norman\\" would have been \\"Strauss, R.: Vier Letze Lieder, Orchesterlieder. by Jessye Norman\\"
1401307450|5.0|gives so much insight into the chili pepper's career. great for hardcore fan or casual, but any casual fan will find themselves looking up all the songs ak talks about it this book. def worth it.
B0036T31YY|4.0|I can't see what is wrong with this movie other than it's running time is way too short, but that is the case with almost all movies anymore. Anyway it's a very vivid well written and well casted movie. I would watch it again.
B002RSDW8A|5.0|Enjoyed the movie.  The acting was very good.  Amy Adams brought a fresh face to the movie.  You felt as if you were living her life.  Meryl Streep becomes the characters she acts.  Don't know of anyone who can be in any movie and make it work...she's the Betty Davis and Joan Crawford of our time.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|Darren Aronofsky haunted me with Requiem For A Dream and has done it again in a different way with the psychosexual drama Black Swan. The film has inspired forum upon forum to psychoanalyze ballet dancer Nina Sayres, grippingly portrayed by Natalie Portman who is sure to win the Academy Award for her performance. Nina pursues perfection in auditioning for the lead role in a production of Swan Lake. The role calls for capturing both the innocence and restraint of a white swan and the seductiveness and free spirit of the black swan. The white swan comes naturally for her; the black swan, on the other hand, calls for getting in touch with her repressed sexuality according to the production director. So begins her mental spiral due to the inevitable tension of such a high-level competition and the pressure she brings upon herself.<br /><br />Black Swan sports a stellar cast that heightens the tension and tone of the film. Supporting cast members include Mila Kunis as a rival dancer and looming threat, Vincent Cassel as the manipulating production director, Barbara Hershey as the unrelentingly overbearing mother, and Winona Ryder as the exiting, \\"washed up\\" dancer with issues who injects guilt into Nina's pysche. Are these characters really as malicious as they appear, or is it all in Nina's mind? This has been the beauty of Black Swan. Where exactly does reality end and where do figments of Nina's imagination take over?<br /><br />Black Swan is weird in a GREAT way by my measure. It's not for everyone, but I think the trailers are spot-on in previewing the tone you can expect while there are still some thrills in store for the viewers who decide to see it. It is unquestionably my favorite movie of 2010!Kudos to Portman, Aronfsky, and the entire cast and crew.
B00004XONN|5.0|i've owned this album since the day it came out. it is when radiohead started to depart from the guitar heavy sound to something more electronic...yet they didn't lose they're soul in the process. i've seen them play most of it live,i've seen them play live five times and they are my favorite band so i could be a little biased here but they are one of the most beautiful bands, both on record and live.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|This was a book well worth waiting for. It had so many twists and turns that it kept me enraptured. Thank you Karen  Moning!
B003O85W3A|5.0|this album was recommended to me by my ex boyfriend and unlike him i love it! its catchy yet haunting. it gets stuck in yr head for weeks. definitely go get it!
1599218011|5.0|I just started the book this week and so far it is awesome, I literally never want to put it down, but I am forced to because of work haha The book is inspiring, informative, and motivating. I absolutely love it so far and I know I will love it even more once I get to the end! I would recommend it to anyone and everyone!
B002N1AEN2|5.0|i heard this album on a local indie rock station and i was so happy something this great finally came out. i saw them live shortly after buying the album and they are even better live. definitely check it out.
1592332803|5.0|I just want to reassure people. There's something for everyone in this book.  I learnt how to make my first focaccia, my first loaf of wholewheat bread,   my first vegan apple pie, my first vegan muffins, my first vegan buttercream  and my first pumpkin bread, vegan of  course.    It ALL came out SO SO good. I trust the recipes and have made those recipes  over and over and over.    Can't wait to try all the rest.  There's enough for a lifetime of experimenting.    PS For those of you who like me dont like hte idea of the egg replacer,  i only made the recipes which dont call for it and there are plenty.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love this video. I'm a runner who runs 25-30 miles per week and regularly practices yoga and lifts a few times a week. I bought this dvd for something different to try. I usually don't like workout videos  because I don't feel like I am getting a \\"great\\" workout. With 30 day shred, I really feel like I have had a great workout and did something for the day. Plus, 30 minutes is such a short time to get in a good workout. The level system is great as well. It's a great way to build up, or each level is great on its own.
B004LRZ2YC|4.0|Fantastic atmosphere and fanastic pacing! The child actors were fantastic, yet the amiance created by the director and photographer was what drove me to write this review. Seldom do I watch a movie and not care where it's going, just as long as it doesn't end.
B0030IIZ56|5.0|my daughter loves this movie and i can't complain!  it's fun to watch with her and even to listen to from the other room.  very very good
0316069884|5.0|I do...I love meat!! As soon as I finished this book my husband asked me what I wanted for dinner. I answered \\"not meat\\". That was over 2 months ago, Dec. 2010. I haven't had it since. No plans to in the future. Just like you can't unsee something...You can't unread something either. If you don't want to know where your meat comes from....What does that tell you?
B001IAOEXU|5.0|I ordered the triggers in October 2009 and have not taken them off my controllers since.  Really helpful for 1st and 3rd party shooting games.  Others have mentioned triggers will pop off which is true.  But I have found this only happens when I am in a tough game situation and pressing to hard.  Easy installation and good durability.  At the price, it is worth a try.
B003NFM3JU|4.0|Was concerned that Disney would veer from the Dickens original story line and presence of Jim Carrey would \\"ham it up\\" but was pleasantly surprised how well this version stayed true to original. 3D wasn't used as a gimmick either, it did add to the viewing experience. Worth viewing!!
B00322PKBW|5.0|I ordered this watch for my 13-year old daughter just before Christmas and it arrived shortly after Christmas.  I let her pick out the color because this Swatch comes in many colors. I wanted to get her this analog watch because she was having trouble telling time in the digital age.  We ask her to tell us the time and I see her making the effort to correctly read the time.  She loves it and wears it every day! One thing about the watch is it has a loud tick. Even though its a men's watch it fits her great and she has slim wrists.
0743454537|4.0|Jodi Picoult gives us plenty to think about in this novel.  She tugs at a parent's heart in ways that most of us never consider.  You find yourself rooting for everyone - there are really no bad guys, just people trying to live their lives under very difficult circumstances.  Even though the characters are at odds with each other, Jodi Picoult makes it easy to relate to their plight.  I recommend reading the book before you watch the movie.
B004D7GU3C|3.0|Musica+Alma+Sexo is not only Puerto Rican heartthrob Ricky Martin's comeback record, but also his attempt at staying relevant in a world where every five seconds a new pop star is born. Is he successful? Somewhat. Does he sound like he is trying too hard? Sometimes. Could he have made this a memorable work? Absolutely.     Where to start when talking about Ricky Martin and the legacy attached to the name? True, he is a pretty boy. True, he popped out of a prefabricated boy band. True, he got on the spotlight at the right time. But it is also true that the guy has talent. His voice is as malleable as his looks and his knack for setting a trend has worked. Until now, at least.    The first thing one notices when listening to MAS is how he continues to embrace the crowd pleasing sounds of today, but does not really look much beyond that, so the results are stale. Take Frio, for instance, a Latin-infused song that will surely be a single soon, that never takes off even in the remix version (featuring Wisin and Yandel) mainly because its construction is basic, flat. Lo mejor de mi vida eres tu is a feel good jingle that sounds more like something a soccer mom would be playing on the way to pick up her kids, than something a young listener would sing along to, that is, unless they do not what good pop is. Title track Mas (or Shine n the English version) sounds more contemporary and gives the record a great intro and a little edge, but unfortunately it leads nowhere past the third song.     I believe the problem with MAS is that Ricky has tried too hard to make it a multi genre record. In doing so he has lost perspective, shot in every direction possible, and dwindled the great possibilities lyrics and rhythms used here had.     With Cantame tu vida he scores a hit. A simple, acoustic song that sails smoothly and where he shows his vocal skills. The complete opposite happens with Te busco y te alcanzo, which departs from a mellow verse into an unbearable whine that is as annoying as surprising for someone who is a master at nailing ballads and infusing them with a living soul.     It is impossible to not bring up Martin's recent admission of homosexuality and its influence in his image and his creative process. Where it may have opened the gates to writing a successful memoir and been the key to gain acceptance from the audience (and disgust from those looking for hidden reasons), it has not contributed to delivering a solid record, as many of us expected. Musica+Alma+Sexo sounds contrived at times, over dramatic at others, but overall it is not the explosive comeback we wanted to hear from him.     The question of whether he is a relevant figure may be tricky for he is a recognizable icon in the arts, but is it because of that alone or because of the quality of his work?
B00006JL1Z|5.0|Absolutely love these two discs and urge those who are fans of Fleetwood Mac to get this set.  Christine and Stevie are fabulous and the live tracks are stellar.  The remastering of favorites like \\"Over my Head\\" and \\"Rhiannon\\" is superb; and, of course, the   cuts from \\"Rumours\\" are as satisfying as ever.  I heartily recommend this package.
B003VR5PPY|4.0|The only reason I gave it a four was because of the pain of having to redo all the puzzles you've done in order to get all six endings (it'd be nice if they had a skip option). Other than that, the game was great. Characters were interesting, and the puzzles were fairly challenging. If you're a fan of the When They cry series by Ryukishi07, or love murder/mystery genres, then this game is for you. :)
0385341008|5.0|What a gem! I loved this book. Gorgeous story, awesome characters. You'll be drawn in and you'll fall for each character in the book, but especially Juliet. Was gutted when I'd finished the book!
B004307O1G|5.0|Nicholas Sparks has created an intense storyline with the novel Safe Haven; with its first edition published in September 2010. Sparks has accomplished a successful level of versatility by mainly mixing suspense, romance, and mystery in a way that appeals to different emotions which makes the story seem realistic by creating a relation between the reader's and character's struggles. Katie, which is later known as Eryn, starts a new life in Southport, North Carolina and is afraid to reveal the reason why she's decided to randomly move in an unknown, small town. She begins a new adventure but remains silent and secretive as she establishes two relationships but little did she know that she will later find herself having to face what she's ran away from. As the story flows, it builds up in to a dynamic plot.          The suspense, romance, and mystery all make Safe Haven a very interesting novel, given that Sparks has never written such a versatile piece. The secret that Katie keeps to herself make readers want answers, forcing them to put pieces together and make an attempt to uncover answers while the story slowly but surely reveals clues until their confusion is gone. Also, throughout the novel Katie struggles to keep her secret from being obvious as she falls in love with Alex, the owner of the small super market she shops in. It makes readers want to see more improvement in their relationship since due to her secret, their relationship moves at a very slow pace but an ideal relationship is fulfilled in the end. The darkness of Katie's secret brings her into a dangerous situation that she faces towards the end of the novel and by that time her relationship with Alex has become serious enough that they both find themselves dragged into fighting with Katie's past until it is entirely gone.               The versatility with the three genres causes mixed emotions in readers. There are parts that will make you laugh, cry, sick, melt and parts that will make your heartbeat at full speed. The relationship between Katie and Alex builds up to a warm relationship that relaxes the readers and help the pages flow calmly. Alex is the type of man that every single woman dreams about for their future; he is a sweetheart. But a negative side is that as Katie shuts him down many times and even when she finally gives him a shot, readers will become frustrated because she refuses to share her thoughts and open up to Alex which brings their relationship to high and low points as he remains patient. When both Katie and Alex face Katie's past, the story turns around completely. Readers will be on the edge of their seat, causing them to feel nervous, anxious, and desperate. The story is one big emotional rollercoaster.          The novel may focus on a few characters outside Katie and Alex but the three main characters are Katie, Alex but also Kevin. Many readers can relate to at least one of the characters. There's Katie, who is trying to move on from her past but is also afraid to let go of it to proceed towards her future. She refuses for a while to share her feelings with her new friend and next door neighbor and rarely tells Alex anything about herself and even less information about her past, which challenges their relationship. Some readers may find themselves in the same situation, struggling to open up to new people in their lives because of painful past experiences as Katie did. Alex is a harmless man that faces a great challenge every day: not only running his own business but also raising his two children by himself. His wife died and he tries his best to raise his children the right way while he keeps his business going. As he attempts to move on and find a new mother for his children, he finds Katie and decides that she is the one but he gets pushed away until she finally gives him a chance. Some readers can connect with Alex's feelings, that when they find the best solution to their everyday problem, something may stop them from taking a hold of it. The last main character, Kevin, is a man that has done a lot of damage. He lives with anger and regret and although he is a very intelligent man, he begins to hurt himself by abusively drinking alcohol everyday which later results into him getting more out of control than ever. Many can relate to him and not because they might drink but because they've allowed anger and regret to take over their actions and has resulted into making poor decisions. These characters are all dragged into one big circle of problems that connect to each other but everything comes together in the end in an unbelievable way.               Many readers that follow Christ can look at the story not only in a literal but in a symbolic and spiritual way. Although Safe Haven is a secular novel, it can also be used as a great lesson to believers. Like Katie, if you are a believer now you may have gone through a situation similar to hers: that once you decided to let go of your past and started over by moving far away from your old life (converting to Christ), you were also still thinking more than you should have about what you left behind. When God comes into your life and tries to change you and make you happy because He loves you and wants what is best for you, you might find yourself pushing Him away because of the pain you hold on to from the past, which is what Katie did to Alex. Katie faces her past like never before towards the end but she decides to not let her past take over her anymore and she does everything in her power to completely remove it out of her life, which helps her relationship with Alex and his family move forward and it all comes together in the end. The Christian perspective lesson is that if you decide to let go of the past once you are in Christ, you will be able to move forward even if you find yourself going through situations, which positively make your walk and relationship with God become stronger and better. Safe Haven serves many purposes; whether it is to read it for enjoyment if you simply want to read it as is by taking it literally or for fulfillment if you decide to look at it symbolically. Either way, readers will appreciate the work Nicholas Sparks put into Safe Haven from beginning to end.

B00004U8P9|5.0|Defiantly would recommended this edition of the movie. The audience participation section is a good idea but not very well done.
B001UHOWXI|5.0|This is the greatest movie ever made.  I bought this for my co-workers as a Christmas present and everyone really enjoyed it.
B0000E6XH3|5.0|If you're a Daft Punk fan you're on your way to listen to some of their best music, if you're aa Anime fan you're on your way to see beautifully animated Leiji Matsumoto characters in a cool compelling stroy that doesn't need a script while the music alone tells you an awesome adventure. If you're both, Daft Punk and Anime fan this is not only a must see but a must HAVE in your anime library. Simply amazing
B002OFWG7O|4.0|Have been a Foos fan from the beginning and indeed it has been an amazing trip!!! One of my fave bands all-time for sure.Have also been a fan from the Nirvana days.As unfortunate as Kurts death was,the Foos prb would have not ever happened.I have all the albums and mainly purchased this cd/dvd set for the videos and the new songs that were recorded for the album and the acoustic version of Everlong.If you like the Foos and their awesome videos and the songs,of course,and don't have all the Foo albums,there is no reason not to buy.I didn't buy it when it was released,but knew I would have to buy for my collection...April 12th 2011 new album...can't wait.
B004AKCMD4|5.0|At the risk of sounding immature, this is one of the best animated movies I've watched. The movie kept me interested enough that I could watch it 10 times after my initial viewing. I'm truly aching for a sequel.
B00436GNVC|5.0|DUFFY JUST KEEPS GETTING BETTER!. THIS PRODUCTION IS FULL OF SURPRISES AND WILL KEEP YOU WANTING FOR SOME MORE, I JUST HOPE SHE KEEPS RECORDING MORE OFTEN.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|Very good series but not as good as Band of Brothers.  You don't seem to get to know the characters like you did in Band of Brothers.<br />Update: After reading Robert Leckie's book \\"Helmet for my pillow\\" and watching the series again I was able to follow the characters more. The book is a must read before watching the show.
B0049GYXDG|5.0|\\"Alice in Wonderland\\", the 1951 Walt Disney animated classic is probably more well-known to this current generation for the live action film that came out in 2010 but for previous generations, the Walt Disney animated classic, the 13th film of the Walt Disney Animated Classics Series captured the hearts of Americans as it technically was an impressive and colorful film.<br /><br />But \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" was one of the most difficult films for Walt Disney.  Originally planned for creation in the '30s, the film would not come out until the early '50s.  With various written adaptations, the difficulty was trying to take the original 1865 novel and bring it to life via animated.<br /><br />Part of the problem lies in the fact that the original novel featured a unique style for its fantasy world from its artwork to its original story.  Many wanted to capture Lewis Carroll's story but Walt Disney felt it was too literal and it was not what he wanted.<br /><br />It's important for people to know that prior to \\"Alice in Wonderland\\",  Walt Disney and its studios were heavily affected because of World War II, also where the first animated film \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\\" were a financial success, the second film \\"Pinocchio\\" was not and other films that would recoup money through worldwide release, wouldn't happen because of the war.  They needed a film that would be a financial hit at the box office and something that would doom the company.<br /><br />While \\"Dumbo\\" was cheaper and did make its money back, \\"Bambi\\" would lose money because of World War II and this delayed \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" (and also \\"Peter Pan\\").  In fact, Walt Disney was heavily in debt from the '30s and '40s that in 1950, everything was put on the line with the film \\"Cinderella\\" and fortunately, the film was financially successful and eventually gave Disney the freedom it needed to create more animated films.<br /><br />\\"Alice in Wonderland\\" (which can be seen as one of the books in the opening of \\"Pinocchio\\") would finally be created after nearly 18 years of discussion of the project and almost 30 years after Walt Disney made the original \\"Alice Comedy\\".<br /><br />And this film would follow visuals full of color courtesy of Mary Blair and company.  Music would be the focus of the film (the film has more songs than any Walt Disney animated film) and would be loosely based on Lewis Carrol's books (this of course would anger British film and literary critics).<br /><br />But unfortunately, the film would not do well initially at the box office and unlike other Disney films which would be re-released theatrically, \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" was not re-released during Walt Disney's lifetime but only on television.  In \\"The Disney Films\\", animator Ward Kimball is quoted as saying the film failed because there were too many directors.  Each director trying to one-up the other director.  In his words, \\"had a self-canceling effect of the final product\\".<br /><br />But \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" did find new life and that was during the late '60s as drugged out college students loved films that were trippy and cool and eventually along with \\"Fantasia\\" and \\"The Three Caballeros\\", \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" became popular.  But of course, Disney didn't want this film associated with the drug culture and withdrew prints from universities.  But Disney eventually would issue a re-release of the film in 1974.<br /><br />But for today's current generation who have watched only the live action film of \\"Alice in Wonderland\\", now is the time to watch \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" as the film is receiving its 60th Anniversary Edition on Blu-ray and DVD.<br /><br />But before watching this film, for those only familiar with the live action film, think about \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" (live action) as a sequel to this animated film.  Where the live action focuses on Alice as a young woman, the animated film focusing on Alice as young teenage girl.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Alice in Wonderland: 60th Anniversary Edition\\" is presented in 1080p High-Definition, Full Screen (1:33:1).  And as anyone who have watched any of the Walt Disney animated classics on Blu-ray, knows that Disney's treatment has been nothing short of perfect.  And because this classic is known for its colors, its animation and presentation, the picture quality of \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" is magnificent.<br /><br />I have tested this film on two different types of televisions and suffice to say, this film doesn't look 60-years-old at all.  Wonderland looks absolutely beautiful!  Colors are vibrant and really come out with clarity and as always with Disney, their frame-by-frame restoration shows as there is not one blemish at all.  Alice's blue dress, the Queen's red and black dress, the artistic backgrounds used throughout the colorful world, everything is full of detail.<br /><br />There are no color blemishes, artifacting, banding, DNR that takes away this visual presentation of this animated classic.  Once again, Disney continues to aim for perfection and again, Disney has achieved it!<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"Alice in Wonderland: 60th Anniversary Edition is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA and French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  The lossless track sounds exquisite and because this film does feature a lot of music, this is the best I have heard of \\"Alice in Wonderland\\".  Dialogue and music is crystal clear, I didn't notice any hissing, crackle or pop despite this animated film being 60-years-old.  This release is the best I have heard of any video release of \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" thus far.  Magnificent!<br /><br />Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Alice in Wonderland: 60th Anniversary Edition\\" features the following special features:<br /><br />  * Disney View - While watching \\"Alice in Wonderland\\", instead of black borders on the sides, Disney View adds artwork that on those black borders by Michael Humphries.

The DVD is presented in full screen (1:33:1), Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound, Original Theatrical Soundtrack, French and Spanish language tracks and subtitles.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />I find it quite interesting because as a child, I admit that I didn't care for \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" as I felt it was devoid the action/adventure of \\"Snow White\\", \\"Pinocchio\\" and \\"Dumbo\\" and even when it was released on video during my teenage and young adult years back in the early through late '90s, I passed on the VHS, LD and the later DVD version.<br /><br />But with these animated classics being released on Blu-ray, as a reviewer, as a parent, \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" has been a film that I have stayed away from until today.  This is the first time I have watched \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" since it was re-released in theaters back in 1981.<br /><br />And 30-years later, watching it today, I have a better appreciation for the film.  For one, how close the animators were in capturing Kathryn Beaumont's mannerism and movements via the live tapings that were done of her back then.  But also watching how Disney has evolved animation-wise with the overall look and feel of \\"Alice in Wonderland\\".<br /><br />Having watched the documentary \\"Walt & El Grupo: The Untold Adventures\\" and seeing how the 1942 South American  trip helped illustrators grasp a new style with colors, and of course knowing the phenomenal Mary Blair's contribution to \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" because of her influence from that South American trip, although this film has been discussed since the '30s and it went through so many screenplays and character designs, the long wait by Walt Disney seemed to pay off as the film is a visual feast.  The animation is fantastic, the artistic backgrounds painted for this film is spectacular and if anything, it's a different kind of animated film that Disney has done before.<br /><br />I have to also say that part of my accepting of this animated film is the fact that I have not read the entire Lewis Carrol stories.  I know that this is a very loosely-based adaptation of the book but Walt Disney wasn't going for accuracy, at the time, he knew what Walt Disney was facing as a company and he needed to create films that were big box office hits and having to tailor it to an audience who have been used to prior Disney-style of animation and storyline and family friendly has always been Disney's focal point.<br /><br />With that being said, if one was to ask me how I rank \\"Alice in Wonderland\\", I would give high marks for animation but as for storyline, while a good and fun family film at times, because Walt Disney was going for a visual film with music than a film with a tight narrative, it's not a film that I can easily compare to a \\"Snow White\\", \\"Pinocchio\\" or \\"Dumbo\\".  It's like comparing apples and oranges, \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" is entertaining but I similar to \\"Fantasia\\", I feel that I enjoy parts of the film.  I can say that I enjoy when Alice meets up with the White Rabbit and Dodo Bird moreso than when she met Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum.  When it comes to music, I felt I enjoyed songs that were sung by Alice vs. songs sung by the walrus and Cheshire Cat.<br /><br />I also have to admit that while I enjoy the beginning when Alice arrives to Wonderland, I felt that my interest in the film was more towards scenes in which there was some sort of action.  May it be Alice trying to get use to her changing sizes or her encounter with the Red Queen.<br /><br />But overall, \\"Alice in Wonderland: 60th Anniversary\\" is an amazing Blu-ray release.  The amount of entertaining and vintage special features included in this release is impressive and the fact that even some of the original special features from the previous DVD release have been given HD treatment is awesome!<br /><br />If you are a big fan of this animated Disney classic, you can feel confident that you are going to get the best looking, best sounding, most complete (in terms of special features) version of the film as of this time on Blu-ray.  It's another magnificent Disney classic released on Blu-ray and is highly recommended!Original Theatrical Trailers (1951 & 1974) - The original theatrical trailers for the 1951 release and the 1974 theatrical re-release.      * Walt Disney TV Introduction (1954 & 1964) - The original TV introductions by Walt Disney for \\"Alice in Wonderland\\".      * The Fred Waring Show (Excerpt) - (30:56) The Fred Waring show featuring Kathryn Beaumont and Walt Disney promoting \\"Alice in Wonderland\\".      * Deleted Materials:        - Deleted Scene: Pig and Pepper - (3:12) Ron Clements and John Musker (writers of Disney's \\"Princess and the Frog\\") sharing  sketches of the \\"Pig and Pepper\\" that was cut from \\"Alice in Wonderland\\".        - From Wonderland to Neverland: The Evolution of a Song - (6:49) An entertaining look at how a song originally written for Alice in Wonderland, finally found its home in another Disney favorite, Peter Pan.

B0001CCY7E|5.0|What can I add?  If you remember the film, then you feel as though you are seeing it again by listening to the music.  However, beautiful as the film was, it was some of the music which really moved me and it still does.  Superb emotional and emotive music.
B003EI2EH2|2.0|Ferriss should be ashamed of this this amoral money grab.  This book has no merit.  I bought it based on the reviews and only found out afterward that the good marks are from his supporters.  Its a total scam.  Endless pages of why the book is great and MAYBE one paragraph of useful content buried under all of the bs. Follow Atkins or Southbeach..this is basically where he swiped the info from and the rest of it is pure crap.  Also this book doesnt work on Kindle because its too hard to skip around between chapters. Lastly he constantly refers you to his blog tor more info instead of giving you the actual info. More money from more blog hits. transparent mercenary. I feel ripped off and angry. Never buy anything else from this clown. NEVER.
1401323952|5.0|I love Nigella's latest cook book, of course for all her excellent recipes, but especially for the words of wisdom preceeding them.  She is so no-nonsense in her approach, and her mastery of the English language is superb.  I am still chuckling over her Kitchen Gadget Hall of Shame - so true, and how human is she.
0316069884|3.0|I wanted to like this book. I wanted to support any effort to bring the ethics of eating animals to a mainstream audience. Unfortunately the book irritated me too much to recommend it.      As an ethical vegan already, of course it broke little new ground. However I didn't expect to be enlightened about the issue; I'm already familiar with it. I expected to appreciate and value the way he framed the topic - opting to engage the reader with narrative, rather than dry research. Foer is a fiction writer, after all. But in service to that goal, it is overwritten and overwrought. Animal-lovers are often accused of sentimentalizing the ethical issues, and this book takes us down that same path. Meanwhile it oozes pretension by name-dropping Kafka, Derrida and Lincoln along the way.    That said, the book should appeal to a sensitive metrosexual urbanite who had childhood pets and a close relationship with his grandma. Someone exactly like Foer.    But my main complaint is that the book holds up the \\"humane\\" ranch, and the people who raise animals in \\"ideal\\" conditions, as models to emulate - while at the same time admitting that these kinds of operations couldn't feed Long Island, let alone America or the world because of the enormity of our demand for animal foods. Foer is overly infatuated with the people who make eating animals more acceptable to the consumer - not less.    An increasing number of people claim to want to know where their food comes from and how it is produced. However they are primarily looking for evidence that justifies the choices they already make. They want their bacon and their turkey melts and their omelets, so they hold up these ranches, which represent a tiny, tiny fraction of the total, as examples of why it's okay. Relieved to read that there are some who are \\"doing it right,\\" and fighting the good fight on behalf of eaters, they close their eyes again and continue to support killing sentient animals for their pleasure of taste. A person like Foer, who at the time of writing was firmly vegetarian, and had done enough research to understand that animals have as much right to their lives as we do ours, should not be adopting the position that it's merely factory farming that is the enemy. In doing this, he's no different than Michael Pollan, whom he seems to loathe (and for good reason).    Frankly Foer's book, like Pollan, allows people to believe that simply being \\"conscious\\" consumers (or having \\"reverence\\" for the animal killed, in New Age lingo) is some sort of moral pinnacle. We can't pat people on the back for eating \\"happy meat\\" and at the same time point out that pigs are as playful as dogs, fish are intelligent, and chickens use language. We can't make a moral and ethical case against eating animals and idolize these \\"happy farms\\" too. It's schizophrenic. Either it's wrong or it's not, and Foer, like most of the country, wants it both ways. (Isn't it more \\"humane\\" to kill an animal who is suffering in a factory farm, rather than an animal whose life is idyllic?)    Finally, the essays inserted into the text by other people, generally experts in their fields, are riddled with hypocrisy and logical flaws. They are cringe-worthy, and not because they're graphic or upsetting, but because they're as pompous in their certainty as Foer.
B00000J6AG|3.0|I bought this CD when it was released in 1999. Back then, it seemed very avante garde. I thought I'd revisit it more than ten years on.    The fact is, it hasn't worn very well. What seemed new and innovative then seems rather old fashioned now. The sounds have been overtaken by better produced, more technologically interesting creations and the revival of melody has left these non-melodic pieces behind. It's not unpleasant, just repetitious and soporific.    Moby, like so many others, was a fad. Briefly popular as the latest thing, ultimately the material didn't have the staying power to be more than a passing success. Buy it for nostalgic purposes, if that's a time you look back on fondly.
0060936223|5.0|I had minimal background knowledge of Patti Smith and Robert Mapplethorpe, but this book thoroughly entranced me.  This work is an enthralling study of friendship, as well as an interesting glance into New York life during the 1960s and 1970s.  I appreciated Smith's resistance to name drop or capitalize on the more sensationalist aspects of her story and to concentrate instead on the importance of this one relationship.  The result is a work of non-fiction that reads as quickly as any novel I've picked up.  I would recommend \\"Just Kids\\" to anyone.
0307272702|1.0|Throughout the book, Taubes focuses on reducing carbs, but there is a long list of differences between modern humans and hunter gatherers besides refined carbs and increased insulin: Grain fattened meat with more saturated fat and less CLA and omega-3, vitamin D insufficiency, a sedentary lifestyle, a shortage of phytochemicals from fruit and vegetables, a shortage of omega-3, eating too much salt, smoking and alcohol. And according to Weston Price, organically grown food, minimally processed food, calcium, fat soluble nutrients and whole grains were important reasons for the health of the people he studied. All these things effect Western diseases including heart disease and cancer.<br /><br />EVIDENCE THAT HUNTER GATHERERS ATE MEAT THAT WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT MODERN AMERICANS EAT<br /><br />On page 163 Taubes says, \\"The idea is that the longer a particular type of food has been part of the human diet, the more beneficial and less harmful it probably is---the better adapted we become to that food. And if some food is new to the human diets, or new in large quantities, it's likely that we haven't yet had time to adapt, and so it's doing us harm.\\"<br /><br />Yet he lets the reader assume that grain fattened meat is no problem even though it has been a staple in the American diet for less than 100 years (it increased during the same era that sugar and white flour increased.) It contains about 10.2 times as much palmitic, myristic and lauric acid as wild elk and about 5.4 times as much as lean grass fed meat. Stearic acid lowers LDL so it wasn't used in the calculation. And I adjusted for the fact that the t-bone had 22% refuse (leaving only 78 grams meat), the grass fed beef had 34% refuse (leaving only 66 grams of meat) and the elk was all meat. You can check T-bone, grass-fed beef and game meat elk in the USDA food composition database for yourself. Not only does grain fed meat contain more palmitic (16:O), myristic (14:O) and lauric acid (12:O), but it contains a lower percentage of LDL lowering stearic acid (18:O) and very little omega-3 or CLA and don't forget, added hormones and antibiotics. And the blubber of sea mammals that live in the arctic contains a much lower percentage of saturated fat than the fat of land animals.<br /><br />On page 164 - 65 Taubes says, \\"The best we can do is what nutritional anthropologists began doing in the mid-1980s---use modern day hunter-gatherer societies as surrogates for our Stone Age ancestors. In 2000, researchers from the United States and Australia published an analysis of 229 hunter gatherer populations that survived deep into the twentieth century to have their diets assessed by anthropologists.\\"<br /><br />Taubes says this is \\"the best we can do\\", then he decides to ignore their findings on saturated fat, because they don't fit his preconceived ideas.<br /><br />In his latest book, [[ASIN:0470913029 The Paleo Diet: Lose Weight and Get Healthy by Eating the Foods You Were Designed to Eat]], published in December 2010, Professor Loren Cordain says that hunter gatherers ate about half the palmitic acid eaten in the modern American diet (this is the main saturated fatty acid that elevates LDL in the American diet.) This is in spite of the fact that they consumed the entire carcass of the animal. This is because they ate wild game (average of .89 grams saturated fat per serving) instead of grain fattened domestic animals (average of 7.04 grams saturated fat per serving). Cordain et al actually gathered the data and did the calculations. Modern HG diets ranged from very low to very high in saturated fat consumption. They were not uniformly high. Because one group can eat a high saturated fat diet proves nothing about people whose ancestors didn't do this. No one with basic knowledge of natural selection and genetics would assume we are all equally adapted to eat a high saturated fat diet. And according to Eaton et al (1988) the average cholesterol of the hunter gatherers they studied was about 124. This can't be achieved on a high diet high in grain fed meat and dairy, unless you have genetic hypocholesterolemia like the Masai.<br /><br />In metabolic ward trials where all variables are controlled and people live in the ward and eat meals prepared by the research staff, LDL is routinely increased by increasing dietary saturated fat when carbs are at a moderate level as well as when carbs are virtually eliminated. For example, Dr. Stephen Phinney conducted a normal caloric intake metabolic ward trial with nine healthy lean men, \\"The human metabolic response to chronic ketosis without caloric restriction: physical and biochemical adaptation.\\" These men consumed nothing but meat, fish, eggs, cheese and cream for 35 days. Their carbohydrate intake was less than 20 grams a day. Their blood cholesterol went up from 159 to 208 on average in 35 days. That is a 31% increase. The average adult in this country has a cholesterol level of 199. A 31% increase would give 261. The high risk category is anything over 240.<br /><br />Humans have always eaten saturated fat, but the average human has never eaten as much as they do now. Then along comes Dr. Atkins and Mr. Taubes who tell us to eat even more. If you are going to recommend a diet for life long consumption by the general public, the burden of proof is on you to show that it's safe. However, every long term study shows that high saturated fat diets are associated with more heart disease than the control. Therefore recommending this kind of diet to the general public seems reckless. Especially since there's no need to eat a lot of saturated fat in order to eat low carb.<br /><br />HOW SOME BUT NOT ALL SATURATED FAT CONTRIBUTES TO ATHEROSCLEROSIS<br /><br />Chemicals in the body have a healthy range. When they're too high or too low it makes us sick, whether it's glucose or LDL or something else. As long as you keep them in the healthy range, I guess it doesn't matter how you do it. Your body needs LDL, but if it's too low there is an increased risk of infection and stroke. If it's too high, there's an increased risk of atherosclerosis and heart attack. You could keep meat consumption moderate like the ECo-ATkins. Or you could eat a lot of meat as long as you avoid fatty cuts grain fattened meat like the Cordain Paleo.<br /><br />Certain dietary saturated fatty acids (16:O, 14:O and 12:O) down regulate LDL receptors on the surface of your cells. This interferes with the cells ability to take in the LDL they need and causes the level of LDL in the blood to go up. In the blood, macrophages absorb oxidized LDL and become foam cells. They continue to grow and eventually rupture depositing plaque inside the artery walls.<br /><br />People are different. Some have more LDL receptors than others which means that eating the same amount of saturated fat does not elevate their LDL as much. And people with too few LDL receptors have hypercholesterolemia and premature heart disease. Saturated fat is not the only risk factor for heart disease but the fewer LDL receptors a person has the more important it is for them.<br /><br />According to a study by Nicholls et al in 2006, consumption of saturated fat impairs the anti-inflammatory properties of high-density lipoproteins as well as endothelial function. And according to a meta-analysis of 24 studies by Ip et al in 2009, higher LDL particle number was consistently associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease, independent of size or density.<br /><br />There are different kinds of saturated fat. Stearic acid lowers LDL. And the diets of HGs had a higher percentage of stearic acid and a lower percentage of palmitic acid than modern diets. Coconuts are rich in saturated fat, but Pacific Islanders consume the coconut water and coconut fiber which contain chemicals that lower LDL.<br /><br />WHY UNCONTROLLED STUDIES CAN GIVE INCONSISTENT RESULTS<br /><br />Heart disease has multiple risk factors. In uncontrolled studies we see a lot of inconsistent results. But associations or lack of associations in an uncontrolled study can only suggest, not prove cause and effect or lack of it. The results depends on:<br />1) CONFOUNDING VARIABLES. These include genetics of the population, smoking, sedentary lifestyle, hypertension, diabetes, trans fat, high glycemic index carbohydrates etc. For example, in an uncontrolled study lower saturated fat can be associated with either less heart disease or more heart disease depending on whether people replaced the saturated fat with olive oil or stick margarine with trans fat.<br />2) THE RANGE OF THE VARIABLE. Studies where the difference between the lowest level of saturated fat and highest level is very great have better resolution than studies with a smaller difference. When the difference is large, the effect of confounding variables is less pronounced. For example, in studies of very high saturated fat diets, even if they are not controlled, the harmful effects of saturated fat override the confounding variables and give consistent positive associations between saturated fat and heart disease. This is why the Seven Countries Study with large differences in saturated fat consumption showed a strong association and other studies where everyone was more or less similar didn't.<br /><br />EVIDENCE THAT EATING LESS SATURATED FAT CAN BE HELPFUL<br /><br />Since there's more than one risk factor for heart disease, it makes since that interventions to treat heart disease that reduce the most risk factors would be the most effective. And the most effective interventions usually involve eating less saturated fat and lowering LDL. For example:<br /><br />In China and Japan where they eat less saturated fat and over 50% carbs, they have a low rate of heart disease and they don't have an obesity epidemic. They eat less sugar and white flour. That seems to be all the vast majority of us need to give up.<br /><br />Dr. Esselstyn used a 10% fat, high fiber diet plus low dose statins to arrest or reverse heart disease in 18 severely ill heart patients. We know it worked because of before and after coronary angiograms and cardiac PET scans. Some had been given less than a year to live by their referring cardiologist, yet are alive and healthier 20 years later. During 20 years only four patients died and none of them had a heart attack. There was no requirement to count calories or exercise to get these results. See [[ASIN:1583333002 Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease: The Revolutionary, Scientifically Proven, Nutrition-Based Cure]].<br /><br />Dr. Ornish also reversed heart disease using a similar diet plus exercise and meditation but no statins. Since then Dr. Ornish has enrolled at least 3800 patients in demonstration projects (to demonstrate savings on surgery) which resulted in over 40 insurance companies including Medicare covering a program in diet and lifestyle for heart disease patients. According to Dr. Ornish, \\"In brief, we found that almost 80 percent of patients who were eligible for bypass surgery or angioplasty were able to safely avoid it for at least three years.\\" See [[ASIN:0345496310 The Spectrum: A Scientifically Proven Program to Feel Better, Live Longer, Lose Weight, and Gain Health]]<br /><br />The Mediterranean diet which is low in saturated fat is also associated with low rates of heart disease. Statins, exercise or meditation are not necessary to produce this result. See [[ASIN:0060578785 The Mediterranean Diet]].<br /><br />Statins alone or exercise alone or meditation alone can't achieve these results. So it appears that diet is partly, perhaps mostly responsible for the favorable results.<br /><br />The book makes no mention of Dr. Esselstyn or that heart disease can be reversed consistently on a diet that restricts saturated fat and cholesterol or that taking fish oil with a high complex carbohydrate diet reduces triglycerides better than eating a high fat diet according to a study by Jim&eacute;nez-G&oacute;mez et al in 2010.<br /><br />All that the book shows conclusively about saturated fat is that it can't be the only cause of heart disease and everybody knows that already. And while high glycemic index carbs are associated with heart disease, low glycemic index, high fiber carbs are associated with reversal of heart disease.<br /><br />The book uses the false dilemma logical fallacy to make it seem like you only have two choices if you're overweight; follow the USDA recommendations and continue to be part of the obesity epidemic or follow Atkins and lose weight and reduce your risk of heart disease.  There are many things wrong with this characterization. First, there are at least two ways of eating low carb that don't require you to eat a lot of saturated fat (Eco-Atkins and the Cordain Paleo). Second, people who are not insulin resistant can effectively reduce blood glucose and insulin, lose weight and reduce the risk of heart disease by reducing high GI carbs and saturated fat, even if they eat 70% carbs. Third, while a few risk factors look good on a high saturated fat diet, many other risk factors are not even measured, and tests show that atherosclerosis is accelerated in the short run and there's more heart disease mortality in the long run. Also, the book uses the straw man logical fallacy to make it seem like the obesity edipemic is the result of eating less saturated fat. However, Americans have not been following the USDA guidelines about the kind of carbs to eat and they have been eating out (with large portions) more than ever, and they are not even close to following the Ornish diet or the Mediterrnaean diet.<br /><br />EVIDENCE THAT EATING TOO MUCH SATURATED FAT CAN BE HARMFUL<br /><br />Six long term studies show that high saturated fat diets are associated with more heart disease, cancer and/or all-cause mortality than the control. This may not seem like very many, but there are no long term studies that show otherwise. All the studies that some people think show otherwise are either short term and don't measure mortality or they only compare one moderate level of saturated fat with another moderate level.<br /><br />First study: \\"Low-carbohydrate diets and all-cause and cause-specific mortality\\" by Fung et al published in 2010. A high-meat diet with about 20% saturated fat had 43% greater all-cause mortality and than an Eco-Atkins diet with 12% saturated fat. This was not an uncontrolled epidemiological study; it's the kind of study that can be used to establish cause and effect because confounding variables have been controlled. The high-meat group ate the same or less trans fat, omega-6 and refined carbs so there's no reason to think something other than the meat caused them to do poorly. This is an prospective cohort study, a kind of controlled observational study that's suitable for hypothesis testing, in spite of what critics say. This kind of study was used to establish the link between smoking a lung cancer. Critics are nihilistic about any evidence against animal fat. But when it comes to uncontrolled observational studies of other cultures (studies that don't have a control group or control for confounding variables), they accept them without critical thinking. The reason they devote so much effort trying to tear it down, is because the evidence against a high animal fat diet is so compelling.<br /><br />Second study: \\"Low carbohydrate-high protein diet and mortality in a cohort of Swedish women\\" by Lagiou et al published in 2007. \\"CONCLUSIONS: A diet characterized by low carbohydrate and high protein intake was associated with increased total and particularly cardiovascular mortality amongst women.\\"<br /><br />Third study: \\"Mediterranean and carbohydrate-restricted diets and mortality among elderly men\\" by Sjogren et al published in 2010. The low carb, high meat group had 48% greater all-cause mortality and 81% greater heart disease mortality than the group eating a MediterraneanDiet.<br /><br />Fourth study: \\"Low-carbohydrate-high-protein diet and long-term survival in a general population cohort\\" by Trichopoulou et al in 2007.  \\"CONCLUSION: Prolonged consumption of diets low in carbohydrates and high in protein is associated with an increase in total mortality.\\"<br /><br />Fifth study: A study of patients on a high-meat diet by Fleming in 2000 showed a worsening of blood flow after one year with an overall 39.7% progression of coronary artery disease.<br /><br />Sixth study: People are different. A high-meat Atkins is especially bad for people with the APOE4 allele. In a study by Corella et al in 2010, when saturated fat intake was greater than 10% of total calories in individuals carrying the APOE4 allele, the risk of heart disease was over 300% higher. About 25 to 30 percent of Americans carry this allele. And people with the metabolic syndrome are more likely to carry APOE4 than other people.<br /><br />Taken together these six studies show that measuring the few risk factors that improve during the weight loss phase does not accurately predict what will actually happen after decades on the maintenance phase. They are giving people a false sense of security.<br /><br />CONCLUSION : THERE ARE SEVERAL WAYS TO BE HEALTHY<br /><br />People are different. People who are insulin resistant have a greater problem with carbs. People with fewer LDL receptors have a greater problem with saturated fat. People with the APOE4 allele are more likely to have problems with both. The Cordain Paleo diet, the Ornish diet and the Mediterranean diet all have less high GI carbs and less saturated fat than most Americans eat and they are all good for heart disease. The list of foods in the Appendix of WWGE only reduces carbs, while increasing saturated fat. It makes sense that the more risk factors you reduce the better results you will get.<br /><br />1.

0451228731|5.0|Daemon - Pronounced like Demon - A computer program that runs continuously in the background rather than under the direct control of a user.<br /><br />Daemon is the first novel from Daniel Suarez. It is a Tech thriller and moves at a rapid pace. This book would make an excellent and very easy translation into film because every chapter can be visualized with ease. I doubt the converson to screenplay would even take much time.<br /><br />The plot revolves around a Dead Programmer (Matthew Sobol) who unleashes a Daemon upon the world through a MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game), video games he created which are the games everyone currently plays. The Daemon sets up a vast network and monitors feeds that set off events which makes people in the real world Avatars like the ones being played in the games. Instead of gamers being in control the Daemon is in contol and manipulating events in the real world.<br /><br />It is up to Detective Peter Sebeck, Technology consultant Jon Ross, and Agent Natalie Philips to discover the plot that was set into motion upon Matthew Sobol's death and try and stop the Daemon before control of the world through technology is completely lost.<br /><br />Gamers and people who love thrillers will love this book. The writing is fast paced and the action scenes are never hard to follow. The dialog makes you feel like you are watching it being said in a movie. There is some tech speak but nothing that a good reader can't follow.<br /><br />As soon as I finished I opened the sequel Freedom(tm) so I can get right back into the action from the cliff hanger.<br /><br />1 Star - Bad/ 2 Stars - underwhelming/ 3 Stars - Good/ 4 Stars - Very Good/ 5 Stars - Excellent
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Many of the negative reviews of this novel refer to the vast differences between this and 'Ender's Game', the preceding novel in the series. For me, that opinion holds no weight at all.    Card doesn't sell out here. Gone is the face-paced action of the first novel, now replaced with a sensitive and slow observation of human relationships and social constructs within a colony on a distant planet in the future. If the first novel was a hyper-intelligent action film, this would be an emotionally biting human drama; more people would see and hear about the former, but the latter has, arguably, more substance and depth. Card could easily have had Ender going on more tactical adventures and given the fans of 'Ender's Game' more of the same, but instead he's stayed true to the character of Ender Wiggin, letting him mature and grow into an adult with an incredible burden on his shoulders. I have never seen an author take such a vast turn in how a sequel is presented. Even Card's writing style has adjusted to portray a more mature perspective and world.     That's not to say that there's nothing at stake here. Present again is the threat of annihilation of a self-conscious species, but presented in such a way that it forces you to look at the events in the first novel in a completely different way.    Don't let the negative reviews persuade you from giving this a try. It's difficult to compare the two novels, as they are so vastly different, so it's better to judge SftD on its own, for what it attempts to do. I first read EG almost 15 years ago, when I was in 4th grade, and I attempted to read SftD shortly after, only to find myself hating it. It took me years of thinking back on it to begin realizing how brilliant it actually was, and that I, like Ender, had just needed to mature and grow up to appreciate what I had experienced.    Short Version: Don't expect more of the same if you're a fan of Ender's Game; you will be very disappointed. I wouldn't recommend for childrenwho were fans of the first book either. I do think Speaker for the Dead is even greater than Ender's Game, but it takes an open mind to accept its differences with the original.

B004EQAVHI|3.0|Coming into this viewing experience I was expecting brilliance.  Yes, I had read the reviews and I had heard the mixed responses, but truth be told I really expected BRILLIANCE.  Sure, a lot of that comes from the fact that the novel was a stunning portrait of growth and adolescence and life lessons and I was hoping (praying, crossing fingers) that the film would follow suit.<br /><br />It doesn't quite do that.<br /><br />The story told is that of a group of clones who grow up with the knowledge that their whole purpose in life is to supply their `originals' with valuable organs at the time needed.  The focal point of the story is on the love triangle that forms between Katie, Ruth and Tommy.  Growing up together at Hailsham, the three friends go through many changes that shape them, for better and worse.  Of course, their life must come to `completion' as they start caring for donors and then eventually donating themselves.<br /><br />I'm just going to get right into my issues.  I may have actually liked this film a little more had I NOT read the novel, but my biggest pet-peeve here is the fact that the film omits some serious plot embellishments that the novel weaves so beautifully into the prose.  Without those moments, those lost conversations and glances, the film loses a bit of its heartfelt core.  That isn't to say that the film doesn't deliver in the sympathetic department, but the lack of follow-through on some of the plot developments left the film feeling a little thin.  It just doesn't `go there' or at least not `all the way there' like it could have, especially with a subject this controversially intriguing.<br /><br />While I loved some of the directorial choices (I am not one for narration, but Mulligan's was astonishingly well placed) I found some of the script work to feel rushed and underdeveloped.  There were so many small facets from the novel that were nonexistent here, facets that would have certainly helped flesh out the characters.<br /><br />Sadly, the rushed feel to the film leaves the ending conclusion feeling uneven.<br /><br />But, where there are negative things to be said, there are also some positive.  Carey Mulligan makes good on the promise she made with last years `An Education' by delivering a beautifully in tone performance that digs deeper than the script initially allows.  She tries to hand us Katie on a platter, uncovering her darkest secrets, and even though her ending resolutions don't quite feel heavy enough, it is solely the fault of the script and the films direction; not her performance.  Keira Knightley is slightly uneven, but when she delivers she delivers quite nicely (her breakdowns are legitimately felt).  UGH, another pet peeve is the handling of Ruth.  When I read the novel I really felt that Knightley was going to WIN the Oscar because that role was just so baity.  After watching the film it is obvious why she wasn't even in contention this year.  The film fails to really flesh her out the way the novel does.  You interest does not fall on her, like it does when reading the novel.  The film is far fonder of Katie and Tommy.  Speaking of Tommy, Andrew Garfield is astonishingly good here.  This guy, I mean where has he been?  This year is the year of Garfield (that Oscar snub stings more and more every day).  Between this and `The Social Network', he is the highlight of the year for me.  The way he molds Tommy is so effortless, so moving.  It is such a quiet performance, one that is almost unnoticed until that last moment when he just collapses.  That moment on the couch when life leaves him and you see his face turn every shade by the natural one; it is just flawless.<br /><br />But, enough gushing over a film that just doesn't truly deserve it.  I mean, outside of a beautifully manipulative score (some gawk, but it really works), some intriguing camera work and Garfield's Oscar worthy performance, `Never Let Me Go' fails to make a mark strong enough for us to hold on.<br /><br />We don't resist letting go; it just seems right.

1439190275|3.0|No one is more concerned with health than I am. I have serious issues that need attending to, and when it comes to \\"diet plans,\\" you name it, I've tried it. I totally agree that grain-based food -- carbohydrate -- is the \\"bully\\" on the block, butting ahead of body fat as fuel, and should be limited -- especially for those who have become oversensitized to carbo intake -- especially sugar/flour simple carbs. But one does not have to go overboard on animal foods to get protein. Let's remember that animal food -- especially animal fat -- has been proven to be closely correlated to all sorts of disease. Let's remember the pollution we inject into the earth, sea and sky from the animal food industry, to say nothing of destroying the forests to make room for cattle grazing. Cattle destined for the world's hamburgers. One can cut back on simple carbs and still maintain a healthy plant-based diet and gain health and lose weight. (Even the Atkins book supplies a vegetarian approach.) I recommend at least taking a look and listen to the other side: [...] -- before going further. No matter what new diet plan comes out, after I study it, I still find myself going back to a diet free of animal food. It includes the health aspects of all the rest of the diets: high nutrition, no excess carbs, no excess fat, no excess sodium or sugar, and at least as importantly: none of the harmful additives that we inherit from what is put into animal feed.
B002ZG98VE|5.0|Another Robin Hood movie?  Really?  Do we need one more retelling of the same story again?  Were these the thoughts that ran through your mind when you heard that there was going to be a new Robin Hood movie starring Russell Crowe?  We have grown up with Robin Hood and his Merry Men through movies like Disney's animated animal adaptation or Kevin Costner's attempt to sound English.  In most Robin Hood movies, Robin is a nobleman who, along with his Merry Men, became outlaws and spent their days robbing from the rich and giving to the poor and causing mischief for the Sheriff of Nottingham and Prince John.  Once the great King Richard returns from the crusade, he blesses the marriage of Robin and Maid Marian and there is peace throughout the land.  Could there really be a different way of retelling the same story yet again?  The answer is yes!  Ridley Scott, in his new adaptation, gives Robin Hood a fresh perspective while keeping the film historically accurate through the story, performance, and the production value.    In Ridley Scott's retelling of Robin Hood, Robin is a commoner pushed by circumstances into a role of leadership to be the voice of the people against the injustices forced upon them.  Robin is portrayed as an honest man who even told the King the truth when he did not want to hear it, but despite this honesty Robin takes the clothes of a dead nobleman and assumes his identity.  This Robin Hood is in a sense still the traditional antihero, but Ridley Scott gives a  better understanding and the reasons why he is this way.  This version of Robin does not rob from the rich to give to the poor just because it would be fun to mess with the Sheriff of Nottingham but rather he does it out of pure necessity due to the oppression caused by the crown.  The tag line of the film is \\"Rise and Rise Again Until Lambs Become Lions.\\"  The meaning of this phrase is to never give up.  There is a strong theme of not giving up throughout the film that is represented through Robin's quest of identity and fulfillment. In this version King Richard is not the good king we're used to seeing, but rather a more cocky man, out for glory who is killed in the first ten minutes of the film.  Another difference is Maid Marian, she is in fact not a \\"maid\\" at all but a married woman.  Ridley Scott takes all that we know of these beloved characters and completely changes them by taking out the cliché bits from the traditional folklore so that we are left with new story lines to explore.   There is a truthfulness in the performance of the actors in this film.  The serious and humorous interactions between Robin (Russell Crowe) and the Merry Men (Kevin Durand, Scott Grimes, and Alan Doyle) feel real and more believable than in so many previous productions.  The fact alone that Russell Crowe keeps a consistent accent through the whole movie unlike Kevin Costner makes it that much better.  The subtle and slightly unconventional nature of the romance between Robin and Marian (Cate Blanchett) brought a new twist to how their romance is typically portrayed.  There can be a tendency in movies to force a romance, and by doing so it can come across as fake and boring but in this film the romance is understated.  It's interesting to note that Alan Doyle of \\"Great Big Sea\\" plays Allan A'Dayle and can actually play the lute. This idea of a musician playing a musician is yet another fact that leads to believability.    Ridley Scott's eye for detail gives credence to the time period through the films art direction and production.  The choice of the locations that were used seemed to be untouched by modern society.  The architecture of the sets from the large castles to the small villages was nearly all constructed by hand.  There is an added depth to the film when the characters are surrounded by real, constructed items that are not just CGI images.  The choice of colors and the cuts of the silhouettes of the costumes give a look and feel of grittiness appropriate to the 12th century.  The cinematography and the artful editing during the action sequences add to the intensity of the drama in the film.  Another important aspect of the film is the score; there is a strong Celtic theme that was thoughtfully composed to keep in line with the time and location portrayed in the film.  Usually when the end credits start to role the movie is over and you go home but the end credits in this film are probably the most creative end credits in a film to date.  Even though the movie is over you can't help but stay and watch the artful animation depicting different scenes from throughout the movie.  It should be noted that this film is rated PG-13 and contains mild violence and some sexual content that may not be appropriate for younger audience members.  Also, some of the actions of Robin and his comrades may be seen as morally objectionable.  That being said, there are also things in this film that can be great learning devices in exploring the main themes and the film.  Robin Hood is a story that has been passed down from generation to generation over centuries.  Although Robin Hood has been told over and over again Ridley Scott brings a new perspective to the story that has not been done before.  This is perhaps the first time that Robin Hood has ever been portrayed in a historically accurate way.  There are some things in the   screenplay that may not have been historically proven but add to the affluence of the story.  The actor's performances and the film's production are what make this classic tale come to life.  One of the foremost reasons this movie can be recommended is because the main theme of not giving up and persevering through whatever obstacles may come your way is a theme that can be beneficial to all ages.
0765326353|5.0|Epic fantasy readers are no strangers to the works of Brandon Sanderson.  His Mistborn trilogy and work on finishing Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time proves that he has the potential to be among the all-time great writers of the genre.  I'm happy to say that The Way of Kings is his best work yet.  Part of this is the passion that you can feel the author has for the world of Roshar.  It's his Middle-Earth; this is the sandbox that Sanderson truly wants to be playing in.    Roshar is a world plagued by monstrous regularly-occuring storms and thus the land is a harsh one, populated by crustacean-like creatures and plants that suck into the earth to avoid the fierce winds.  The narrative focuses on three characters; the soldier turned slave Kaladin, the young noblewoman Shallan, and the honorable high prince Dalinar.  Of these, the most focus is given to Kaladin, whose life is shown through flashback chapters that span the novel.      Kaladin is Sanderson's best character, well-rounded and compelling to read about.  Dalinar, who suffers realistic visions of Roshar's rich history during storms, also has a fascinating storyline.  The same, unfortunately, cannot always be said for Shallan, whose \\"witty\\" dialogue often comes across as contrived.      It should also be noted that The Way of Kings is a beautiful book.  Numerous illustrations including maps, creature drawings and pages from Roshar's history are placed throughout the novel.     I've read of complaints here about poor editing.  While the occasional misplaced word or off-sentance does exist, the novel is so fast-paced and ultimately satisfying that I found them easy to ignore.  Later printings will likely correct these.    The Way of Kings is the first of a planned ten of The Stormlight Archive.  It's an engrossing introduction to a vast new fantasy landscape that readers can look forward to enjoying for many years to come.  Highly Recommended.
031603438X|5.0|this is an excellent read.  Its like listening to Keith talking, telling his story; like sitting around having (insert your bad habit of choice) with him and shooting the breeze, swapping old stories.
B003L20IFQ|1.0|all but the last picture show him in a coffin. the last picture is just him and the director (not in the movie) this movie starts and ends in the coffin. there is seriously no other scenes. he was the only actor other than like maybe 3-4 people he talked to on the phone (which you never saw). stay clear of this trash.
B001E45XT4|4.0|If you are a person that likes to wear headphones for videos, games, music etc. for long amounts of time, this is one great headphone for you. I've been using these for 4 hours now, and my ears feel no different, and nothing has happened to the headphones. Comfort is great, Sound quality is good, mic is great.         The bass is a bit low, but its the BEST you can get for around $20. Yes, you can spend $60 on good sound quality headphones, and they will be great; but if you only have $30 to spend on headphones, they these are the best available. It works great for movies, games, and music. Stereo is fine for music and movies, but seems like these days everyone is using 5.1/7.1 Surround sound. But don't get me wrong, I can hear footsteps of enemies fine, and also suppressed gunfire in-game. You can't quite make out if the sound is above, or below you, but the direction is clear as glass        The casing of the actual headphones is pretty great. It's made of very hard plastic, and seems like it wont break ever. It is a closed-ear headphone, so  it does go all the way over your ear, but you can still hear outside sound pretty well (when nothing is playing). It has a nice thick wire which wont break unless done intentionally. The ear muffs are made of soft velvet (couch type material), and not leather which I like. It does attract fallen hair sometimes, but it's no big problem.        I gave it 4 stars because the sound quality isn't at it's best, BUT it is the best you get for this price. Don't hesitate to buy them!
B00021HBGS|5.0|I bought these for my 18 month old son, and he loves them. He's crazy about cars, and loves taking baths, so it's a good combination. The pack includes so many \\"stickers\\" that I only put half in the bathroom, and saved the other half for later, in case the first batch gets yucky. But it doesn't seem that they will so far, they dry very quickly and seem durable. I also like that the storage net was included, so I can keep the stickers separate from his other bath toys. This is a simple & fun bath toy, I highly recommend for toddlers.
1400031354|4.0|I dunno know why I never wrote a review about this book. I enjoyed listening to it on cd last summer.The main character Mma Ramatswe is a middle aged lady detective of traditional build who is aiding an American woman whose son disapeared years ago and was never found.Mma Ramatswe sympathises,she lost a child too and it still bothers her sometimes. The mystery is a bit of sleeper, but that is fine. Because their are all these little subplots happening,( along with a romance going on) along with musings from all the differant characters about what Botswana used to be like versus what the country is like now.( It reminds me of what America was like forty years ago) How woman in Botswana are having a little woman's movement of their our own and trying for their voices to be heard. I also like that Alexander Mccall does this weird thing called humour taps. He taps you on the shoulder with little zingers of humour and then leaves.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|This set looks great, and the Bluray discs are awesome.  The comentary by Ridley Scott is awesome.  IF your a fan of the directors, or the movies I highly recomend this.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I read this  book (paperback) several years ago but didn't continue the series because the third (and at the time, the final) book wasn't yet finished.  I always planned on picking it up again and continuing the series when it was completed.<br /><br />After I received my Kindle (3rd gen), I immediately thought of this series.  When I saw that the third book was completed I jumped to reread Game of Thrones.  However, due to some negative reviews about the Kindle version (and the fact that I couldn't find my paperback) I put it off and almost didn't buy.  Several months later, I could wait no longer and took a chance on the Kindle version.  Are there some typos?  Sure, a handful of very minor ones.  Don't let the negative reviews of the Kindle Edition dissuade you from buying this book.<br /><br />The characters are excellent.  The twists are unexpected (Martin isn't afraid to kill his characters).  The world is rich.<br /><br />On a side note, almost immediately after purchasing Game of Thrones it came to my attention that the series was to be expanded beyond the originally planned for trilogy.  Oh well.
B001PLOK4U|4.0|With great anticipation I sat down to watch two favorite actors, Denzel Washington and Forrest Whitaker perform in a movie whose title intrigued me no end. The Great Debaters is a fictionalized real account of a debating team from a small black college in rural Texas rise to challenge the Debating Team from Harvard.<br /><br />First they must be selected, which means candidates have to get past a professor with a hyper mercurial mind and spirit, and who spits out questions and challenges like the snap of a rabid dog. That would be Denzel Washington who explains to his team how slave owners tried to break the mind while salvaging the body for work.  In one of the better lines of the show he tells them he is going to teach them how to take back their minds. \\"Debate is a blood sport,\\" he declared. (I loved it already).<br /><br />The movie develops around the four students he selects for the team, and their personal lives. James Farmer Jr. (Denzel Whitaker and related to neither) is the youngest of the team, and the son of a strict father and preacher played by Forrest Whitaker. He appears to be an unlikely character for convincing oratory, but his facial expressions are like beacons that bring light from your screen. His acting career should go nowhere but up.<br /><br />Nate Parker plays one of the conflicted debaters who uses the debates to fight his demons while he continues dalliances at the local dive with ladies regardless of their marital status. He turns on enough charm to seduce another team member, Jurnee Smollett played by Samantha Booke.<br /><br />The moral of the movie is that those who strive for excellence will achieve excellence, but this message is almost contradicted by the rampant, violent racism that permeated the South. Dr. Whitaker accidentally runs over a farmer's pig, and gently negotiates his reparation while maintaining his family's safety. It is obvious that the white trash he is bargaining with is just itching to get physical. But the second incident is beyond the physical. As the team is riding down the road in the professor's car, they come upon a lynching in progress. When the crowd discovers that the occupants of the car are black, their bloodlust sends them toward the vehicle, which manages to shift gears and turn around just in time. Such morbid racism suggests that excellence achieved is not just the pursuit of excellence but random selection in a predatory environment.<br /><br />I enjoyed the film and the dialogue, but there was something missing. There was little build-up in who was selected or why. (Perhaps that comes from being forced to view The Bachelor too many times). Under the direction of Denzel Washington, the suspense, which is key to a good debate, was missing. There would be a few lines, or sometimes none at all. Suddenly, you found out they won or lost.<br /><br />My score is four stars for a movie worth watching once. If you don't agree with my review or my score, well, I'll be happy to debate you.cal.

1936594234|2.0|This is a great subject.  The content is good, but the book I received has no chapters.  It is like a run-on sentence.  It does not have an index either.  I have no idea why this is the way it is, but it is very annoying and I have trouble continuing to read it.
0307346617|5.0|I was expecting something lighthearted, tongue-in-cheek, a global melee of headshots and brain-eating--in the vein of [[ASIN:1594743347 Pride and Prejudice and Zombies]], a zombie take on General Sir John Hackett's 80s classic [[ASIN:B000JI517A The Third World War]]--yet was very pleasantly surprised to find instead this deep, well thought out fictional oral history, a collection of interviews and short memoirs of survivors of the global zombie war (this is a future history, a la Kunetka and Strieber's still surprisingly comparable [[ASIN:B000O7WYO4 War Day]]).  It holds together very well, and is very interesting and thought-provoking.<br /><br />First off, there is no attempt whatsoever to explain the scientific basis for zombies, which is just as well.  We know only that they came out of mainland China, strongly implying an avian influenza-type mutation, or at worse military medical-chemical experimentation gone really wrong.  Coming up with some kind of zombie science, of course, would be a self-defeating exercise, inventing necessarily ridiculous and bogus medical/scientific descriptions, which in the end would subtract from the true power of these (fictional) oral histories.  This book is not about the origins and rise of the global zombie threat, it's about how mankind reacted.  It really doesn't matter why/how the zombies emerged; they did, and the far more interesting story is how mankind couldn't imagine it, ignored it, initially failed to address it, and eventually rose to the challenge.<br /><br />This book takes on most of the big-picture issues of what a global zombie war would involve and affect.  It talks strategic decision-making, unpleasant sacrifices, economic effects, military strategy, operations and tactics, as well as communications and the role of propaganda, politics and international relations, with some unanticipated nuclear exchange thrown in for fun.  But the one issue I was really hoping Brooks would take on, that he would have some of his narrators latch onto and wrestle with, was religion.  Disappointingly, religion didn't get a thorough treatment.  Brooks touches on it here and there, but never fully confronts and tackles it.  World War Z sure as hell ain't The Rapture, but it's a resurrection, and not the good kind.  So what does this do the Big Three belief systems, and how do they fare?  What new beliefs come about, and how do they evolve and then grow/fade?<br /><br />I really enjoyed Brooks' deep exploration on the true nature of the zombie enemy, and how to beat him.  He's not bright, fast, or thinking rationally, but he never ever stops, with no pain, remorse, ethics, morals or fear, so our humano-centric military doctrine goes right out the window.  The zombie is a \\"...self-contained, automated unit...;\\" there is no reasoning with him, and no single or collective will to fight to target and cripple.  The only option is eradication, and it has to be done with proper training and equipment.  Brooks spends lots of time on this, and it is very engaging reading.<br /><br />And because they're already dead, water is no problem for zombies.  They can't swim, so they sink, or more correctly, sort of wander around the bottom, and if the water gets shallow, they can come on up and grab you.  I never thought of that before, but Brooks sure does explore it, in a number of fascinating ways.  But the narrative went a bit off the rails here.  We saw on land that animals would not go zombie (zombie raccoons, bears, coyotes, deer would have made it really interesting), so it was unclear--and not addressed--if sharks or other sea predators would have a carnivorous go at zombies, and if you would then end up with Great White zombies (isn't that a Danish thrash-metal band?).  Wouldn't that be awesome, a horde of zombie sharks?  I see a wide-open opportunity for the zombie fiction oceanographer...and an enterprising B-movie producer...<br /><br />Lots of people and organizations get a grilling, and some folks get good press.  The underfunding of the FDA is decried.  Vapid celebrities like a certain unnamed \\"...little rich, spoiled, tired-looking whore,\\" and her idiot-ilk get what they deserve, from zombies and an enraged human populace.  Military greats MacArthur, Halsey and LeMay are called \\"...insipid, egocentric clowns...\\"  Political decisions are implicitly criticized, such as any number of US \\"brushfire wars.\\"  A certain Vermont \\"whacko\\" (Howard Dean, mayhaps?) gets a lot of time, most of it positive.  Colin Powell (apparently) comes through as The Man, President of the United States, and REM's Michael Stipe apparently makes it through.<br /><br />Brooks is good on his terms and equipment, getting the use of \\"ChiCom,\\" \\"maskirovka\\" and many others right, as well as just about perfect descriptions of almost every modern weapon system and their employment.  His geography is spot-on.<br /><br />Great to see a name-check of the 3rd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry.  I played rugby with and against these guys in Germany in the 80s.  We even get a mention of the Tri-Nations tournament and a notional trouncing of the All Blacks by the Springboks, and later another All Black mention.  Good on ya, Mr. Brooks.<br /><br />And in the end, what did it all mean?  For those who survived, it was a forced return to the vitality and reward of life, having to be aware and alert, having had to defend globally against a common enemy for survival, and a forced return to a simpler, significantly more empty planet.  It wasn't about starting over, but still a fundamental re-set.  In the end, it was a cleansing, with the weak and ignorant culled without mercy, an undead Malthusian solution.<br /><br />Bottom line: this book is surprisingly inventive, creative, and fun, and the value-added is that it's really well thought out, an almost scholarly meditation on what it really would be like if the dead were to rise.

0803726570|4.0|We received \\"Room on the Broom\\" as a gift 4 years ago, and it remains one of my daughter's favorite books. It may seem like a Halloween story, but it's appropriate for any time of the year. With its sweet story of a friendly witch making room on her broom for other animals and the story's excellent rhyming and lovely illustrations, it makes for a very good bedtime read. (I also highly recommend The Gruffalo and the Gruffalo's Child, both by the same author/illustrator team)<br /><br />As such, we wanted to give a copy as a birthday gift, and so I ordered the Hardcover version (we own a paperback). But when it arrived in the mail, the publishing error that Tanya Fox wrote about in her review had NOT been corrected. Our copy of the book has the \\"I'll have witch without fries\\" line (which we find funny). But the hardcover book I purchased has the \\"I won't let you go, do you think I'm a fool?\\" version, which I don't think is as nice. I ended up giving the book as a gift, since I didn't have time to buy another gift or search for another copy.<br /><br />I don't know which version of the story is the original one (the author is British and the book was originally published in England), because both our book and the recently purchased book has the publishing date listed as 2001. I can only guess that one version was written for the U.S. market, but again, I don't know which version. It's still a good read, but I do prefer the \\"french fries\\" version of the story.<br /><br />Update (March 2012): I have purchased the Hardcover version of this book two additional times after I wrote this review. The first had the \\"french fries\\" line, so I was quite happy, thinking that perhaps the mix-up with the word changes had been corrected -- or at least, the french fries version is what was going to be published in the U.S. But then the next copy I ordered had the other lines in it again! Very frustrating. We still adore the book, and my daughter still requests it, but if you decide tobuy the book, it's still caveat emptor (buyer beware).
0143116177|4.0|Not what I expected.  Ferguson outlines origins of various asset classes (banking, stocks, bonds, insurance, etc.,) and ties them neatly to larger events (war, revolution, booms/busts) in history.  A good and quick read, although does not go into tremendous depth.  That being said, I'd still recommend it.
B0046UGSNS|1.0|I gave this movie 1 star because it wouldn't let me choose 0 stars.  I chose this movie because it was a comedy and the description said \\"heart-warming\\" modern family movie.  I only watched 2 minutes of this movie before I realized that it was not something that was going to warm my heart.  The first scene showed a teenage girl considering sex, the second scene showed 2 teenage boys snorting drugs and getting into a big fight, and the third scene showed the two teenagers sitting down with their gay female parents for dinner.  All this in the space of 2 minutes!  Since I disliked all of the characters from the very beginning it seemed pointless to continue watching.  I think the description should have referred to a comedy about a \\"modern dysfunctional family with serious problems\\".  If you are a traditional family values oriented person I would recommend you stay far away from this movie.
B001E2JNA6|5.0|I have just recently realized how much I love Colin Firth as an actor (I don't know how he escaped me so long!), so I have been on a search for all of his films.  I struck gold with this one!  I loved this miniseries!  The chemistry of the entire cast was fantastic, and the day flew by!  Like others, I couldn't pull myself away until I watched every episode.  I found the blue ray version locally for close to $50, but I was able to order it for barely more than $20...great deal!  The picture was a bit grainy at times, but it didn't take anything away from the film.  I haven't watched all the extras yet, but so far I have enjoyed the ones I have seen.  I would highly recommend this film to any Jane Austin (or Colin Firth) fans!

B0034G4P7Q|5.0|From the opening conversation, you can tell you're watching a David Fincher movie, just by the lighting. After the conversation, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross's score first plays and it was from that moment on that I knew I was about to watch something really special. This is a film I didn't get to see in theaters due to the never ending calling of the parenthood drum. I wish I had but hey, I got my hands on the Blu-Ray and I'm happy to say that the film gets a very well deserved treatment.<br /><br />The film itself is really something. It maintains a level of intensity that rarely lets up, something pretty impressive for a film that is about 99.5% dialogue. The acting across the board is perfect. Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, Justin Timberlake all turn in exceptional work. I'd really also like to point out the efforts of Armie Hammer and Josh Pence, who play the Winklevoss twins. Seriously speaking, they had their work cut out for them and they achieve something truly awe inspiring with their performance with the help of digital effect magic. I am not the biggest fan of CGI but when its used in the right way and as seamlessly as it is presented here, then I'm a happy camper.<br /><br />Aaron Sorkin is indeed a master of the written word and his dialogue comes off as near perfect. Fincher is running on all pistons and really, were you expecting any less? This guy has come a long way since being the plucky filmmaker screwed by a major studio. I'm happy to see that he's still putting out great work that walks a fine line between flashy and superbly efficient filmmaking.<br /><br />OK, enough about the film. The Blu-Ray presentation is pretty well laid out, with a feature length look at the making of the film. It covers just about everything you could ask for. There are several other featurettes that focus on other topics, the most interesting being the one concerning the score. I think the score is one of the things that make this movie work and in a way is its own character. Two separate commentaries provide you with plenty of insight from director, writer, cast and crew. The film looks pretty crisp and the sound design, as it usually is on Fincher's films, is high caliber.<br /><br />Yeah, I'd recommend this disc. If you liked the movie, you will like the presentation and appreciate the supplemental materials, that is if you're interested in that sort of stuff. And if you haven't seen this film, you should. It's a film that has received an insane amount of praise and nominations and I can honestly say that it's a very rare thing when a film or anything else for that matter lives up to the hype.ate commentaries provide you with plenty of insight from director, writer, cast and crew.

There's a reason this book has the reputation that it does. And by the way, if you're going to get this book, make sure you get this hardcover edition. It will withstand the wear and tear that a normal paperback edition will undoubtedly suffer.

B000IZ7YMY|5.0|This movie was, quite possibly, one of the most poignant movies I've seen in a long time. I'll spare you the plot details- you'll find those in other reviews or the summary- but \\"The Four Feathers\\" is, essentially, about trust, bravery, cowardice, love, and above all: friendship. It made me laugh, smile, and sob when the situation called for it. Lovely, and definitely worth watching!

B001IBIHQ4|4.0|Not really as good as \\"Band of Brothers\\" and not nearly as well produced, \\"The Pacific\\" does address the fact there was a part of World War Two that was more terrible than most have heard, and the men who fought that war, never really were given as much credit for surviving what they did. There is a lot of family dram in the series that makes it a little too much like a soap opera and that distracts from an otherwise fine performance by the cast. I'll watch it again, if that means anything, but I won't sit there and play it for hours on end like Band Of Brothers.<br /><br />Don't watch the Okinawa part while eating, please.

B003Q6D2B4|4.0|Someone wants Frank Moses (Bruce Willis), retired CIA/assassin, dead. Now living a very uneventful life, Frank finds solace and companionship with Sarah (Mary Louise Parker), a seemingly bored customer service representative. Monthly he uses the excuse of his checks being issued in the wrong amount to work his way into her life. After an attempt is made on his life, the unknown enemy decides to kidnap his new love interest and use her for bait, which inevitably turns in a game of cat and mouse. Determined to rescue her and discover the truth, Moses visits other retired agents seeking their help. And what a group of talented actors, who each brought an authentic quality to their roles (with the exception of one that I will mention later). Joe (Morgan Freeman) is living in a retirement home, literally dying and this seems to be an opportunity for some last minute fun. Victoria (Helen Miran) is enjoying her life as a simple woman (who once put three bullets thru the man she loved simply because the agency wanted her to) and would remind you of a loveable but deadly grandmother. Paranoid, conspiracy theorist Marvin (played by the delightful John Malkovich) is only to willing to show Moses how the present events are related to a past transgression of someone they know.  Ivan (Brian Cox) is simply willing to spend time with the woman who he has never stopped loving, even if she shot him (3 times) and left him for dead. There is the devoted and dedicated CIA Agent who will stop at nothing to get his man. And finally, there is the very shady Alexander (Richard Dreyfuss) who is not what he appears, and who believes that he single handedly has created the Vice President (Julian McMahan) who is destined to be President. Both are willing to stop at nothing in an effort to protect a secret. Eventually, Moses figures out why they all have been scheduled for elimination and works hard to reveal the truth.     I thought that this was a decent movie with a great cast. However, I didstruggle with the final rating and ended up giving this movie a 3.5 to 4. I tend to rate it higher because the fabulous actors made me overlook the defects in the storyline. The only character that I was never sure about was that of Sarah. I kept thinking that the final twist should have been that she was an agent meant to seduce Moses but also learn the truth (or something...more), instead she just seemed a little too simple lacking the same depth that the other characters. She moved from wanting to get away, to falling into line wanting to participate in a dangerous adventure. I don't know, she was the only character that I really didn't like, which was hard since she was the center of the storyline. Perhaps another actress would have made the character more likeable for me. Anyway, I definitely would recommend this for someone who is looking for just the right amount of humor and adventure.

B0034G4OUO|4.0|I know this movie did not do that well money wise, but I thought it was the Rock at his finest. He was made for this role and performed it like a veteran actor. It is similiar to other movies involving revenge, but this movie takes it to a much higher and violent level. The action is very fast paced and actual bordered on brutal killings, which are great and crowd pleasing as you root for the protagonist to \\"Get Even\\". Billy Bob Thorton is good as always while playing a burned out detective.  I can not say too much more or it will spoil the different plot twists in the movie especially towards the end. You don't have to be a Dwyane Johnson fan to really love this movie. Johnson simply excels in his role due to his physicality in looking the part he is playing, and the bonus is the action and excitement. Great movie. If you saw \\"Walking Tall\\" and liked it, you will love this one all that much more as it is a much better movie.

1439107955|5.0|What a marvelous and important book.  On so many levels -- as a cancer patient, biographer, and reader -- I feel indebted to Siddhartha Mukherjee for writing this strange history. Armed with the gifts of a born storyteller, a sympathetic heart, a first-rate mind, and a proper humility in the face of the formidable and ingenious \\"emperor,\\" in all its guises, Dr. Mukherjee has done a public service with this great and beautifully written book.  Though his ultimate message is that cancer may always be with us, I finished the book feeling more hopeful about treatments than I ever have before.  And if a book about cancer can be called a pleasure to read, The Emperor of All Maladies--with its fine architecture and literary references as varied as Alice's Red Queen and the writings of Susan Sontag, etc--is it.

B001E45XT4|3.0|These headphones, for the price are phenomenal. I use them while playing StarCraft 2: Wings of Liberty, and for skype calls. My friends all agree, that these are great mostly due to them being unable to hear my typing anymore, and for the fact that I am still clearly heard. The comfort is great too. They are tight enough to not move while I'm moving around my room or living room table, and at the same time, they are loose enough for my glasses that I wear while I play SC2.    The sound quality is great as well; rich heavy basses, and pure, clear highs. I cannot recommend these highly enough.     ----EDIT: PLEASE READ----  So, after about half a year of usage, I discovered something rather crappy; the microphone had broken without me ever realizing it. This led to a long, and tiresome time figuring out what had broken. But after cleaning the contact points, having the motherboard replaced on my computer (it's a laptop), and finally fooling around with my connections, I am not too happy that these broke so quickly.

B003ODL004|5.0|Hans Zimmer has hit it out of the ballpark, again. This is a really amazing score that is filled with moments of quiet reflection that suddenly lead into eruption of action. It works on so many levels. Sure, there are a couple of tracks that are a bit long, but they are still really well done.   My only complaint with the tracks is that there is a ton of music missing. We need a more complete edition to be released. I will hope for such a thing in the future, but I won't hold my breath.

B0038Z5T4Q|4.0|This movie was riveting -- it fed right into my latent, grandiose desire to become rich and powerful and to win the contest.  Then, bang, it turned my fantasy on its head, and showed the incredible ugliness and soullessness behind the fantasy.  (At this point I considered turning off the movie, as I started feeling physically repulsed.  Thankfully I hung in there.)  But then, shocker of shockers, the plot changed, the ugliness was exposed for what it was, and the protagonist came to his senses:  he realized the false path he was on and used the power he had gained to try to salvage himself.  He may not have salvaged himself perfectly, but he did a damn good job.<br /><br />The acting, overall, was excellent.  Michael Douglas and Martin Sheen were stunning, and so were most of the lesser characters.  Charlie Sheen was great overall, but had some occasionally weak moments that detracted from the film's believability.  Daryl Hannah was good overall but at some key moments came across as too sweet and gentle for the part.  Yet by no means do they kill this film; it's bigger than they are.<br /><br />Also:  excellent writing too.  I was impressed.<br /><br />There's a reason this film remains a classic after over two decades.  Overall it's brilliant.  Someday I'll watch it again.<br /><br />My final thought:  Charlie Sheen (who, as of February, 2011, is presently self-destructing with drugs and women and money) would do well to watch this movie for its deeper messages.

B000UAE7RW|5.0|This movie was spectacular.  Everything about it was just off-the-charts.  Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway (and all the other actors, without exception) were at peak performance.  The story was crisp and tense and kept me on the edge of my seat.  The cinematography was stunning.  (Okay, maybe the music could have been a drop better, but it was still quite good enough.)  And what I loved was that you really didn't know where the plot was going.  I'm so sick of the average Hollywood movie that feeds you what it wants and lets you know exactly what to expect.  Not here.<br /><br />So, all in all, although I find Roman Polasnki repugnant as a human being, he has a wildly creative and unique gift as a film director, and I respect that.

030726999X|4.0|I still found the book gripping and read it in less than two days.  I was hooked on the trilogy, so there was no way I was not going to finish it in order to \\"find out what happens.\\"  And in large part this book did not disappoint.  Some parts stood out brilliantly, especially the trial at the end, with the evil Teleborian on the stand.  I personally happen to be pretty strongly anti-psychiatry, so I found this part especially pleasing and tension-ridden.  I've had all too many debates with arrogant, \\"evidence-based\\" psychiatrists to underestimate their cleverness, closed-mindedness, and subterfuge -- and these are psychiatrists who strive to be ethical, and are only hobbled by denial.  The skewering of the evil Teleborian was nothing short of lovely.<br /><br />This book, however, was the weakest of the trilogy.  Its biggest flaw was that several times the plot just didn't quite add up to reality.  I don't find myself further gripped by a novel when I feel I'm more clever than the author.<br /><br />For instance, when the author placed Salander and Zalachenko on the same open-door, unlocked hospital floor after they'd both tried to murder each other:  silly and unrealistic.  Even a half-witted hospital or police staff would have prevented that.  I understand, though, that the author did this to further the book's plot.  But, oddly, keeping them on the same floor didn't even further the plot that much.  C'mon, Stieg, get with it!<br /><br />Also, I thought to myself several times (and in the previous book as well) that the \\"Section,\\" as they were called, would realistically have murdered Zalachenko and Salander long ago.  The fact that they waited so long to even consider doing so came across as ludicrous to me, especially given their obvious lack of ethics.<br /><br />A few other weaknesses (sorry, I know I over-focus on the weaknesses):<br /><br />1) This was the first book in the trilogy that I found myself skimming.  Several times I skimmed the author's long background descriptions on Swedish political history and the history of various spy organizations.  Editor, editor, wherefore are thou?<br /><br />2) I also skimmed, and then utterly ignored, the book's chapter (or section) intros.  They were pointless and added nothing to the book except proof of the author's grandiosity.<br /><br />3) Rather weak ending.  I understand the author wanted to tie up all loose ends, but I was hoping the book would somehow depart in a blaze of plot glory.  Instead it just petered out.<br /><br />4) There were several unanswered questions that I felt sure the author would address.  For instance, in the second book the author dropped hints that there was something physiologically deficient about Niedermann -- his weak face, his utter lack of sexual interest. Was he somehow neutered?  Occasional similar hints were dropped about Salander.  The author never addressed these.<br /><br />But, overall, this book, and the trilogy as a whole, was a gripping, captivating read, and all the more so if you have any interest in Sweden.

1439152780|5.0|The Distant Hours by Kate Morton is a book about three sisters living in a decaying castle that has belonged to their ancestors for centuries; it is about the relationships between mother and daughters, sisters and family.  It is a haunting novel about books and how stories that we read as children can inspire the rest of our lives. A book about family secrets, past mistakes shaping future generations that keeps with the same tone and spirit as the classic gothic novels of the 18th and 19th century.      I can't begin to describe how much I loved this book!  Kate Morton has become one of my favorite writers and I have enjoyed her other novels, The House at Riverton and The Forgotten Garden but in my opinion this book surpasses both of the others.  I have been saving this read for a while now, waiting until I was in just the right mood to pick it up and I figured that the dead middle of winter would be an excellent time for a good gothic read.      I think one of the strongest aspects of this book is the writing of the book.  Kate Morton keeps the same gothic, creepy and suspenseful tone throughout the whole book, and it keeps the readers interested and intrigued.  It is very easy to imagine yourself discovering the Milderhurst Castle for the first time right along with Edie.  Readers feel the same emotions that the main characters feel while they are feeling them.  I also thought that the transitions from one time period to another or from one tense to another was smooth and kept the story going.  I noticed that in her earlier books these transitions were not as smooth and there were times I found myself confused but in this book she masters these transitions and when she decides to switch time periods is always the perfect time giving the reader just enough information but not too much.  She ties all of the ends to the story well and makes her characters easy to believe and sympathize with.      I would strongly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for theperfect winter read, dark and creepy but with the right amount of plot to keep the story going.  I look forward to reading anything that Kate Morton writes because I think she gets better and better as she goes.

0399536108|4.0|This book definitely applied to me since I read it right after I left the previous company I started to form another.  I liked some of the ideas in this book and it's a good read for those people who have never worked for themselves.  If you've already been in business for yourself then I think you will have a much better grasp for the book.  The thing I don't really like about this book is it talks about making changes in your life and never really goes about saying specifically how to do it.  If you're not experienced running your own business, then the book doesn't seem much more than something to get you excited about leaving your corporate job.  I think Tim Ferriss' The 4 Hour Work Week, in conjunction with this book will help take you a little farther than this book alone, but together there are still holes in making the serious life change that both these authors speak of.  Overall, certainly worth the read, I've already recommended it to a few friends.

The kings of symphonic rock were riding a wave during the Brain Salad Surgery Tour and this was originally released as a 3 album set that was panned by critics as being pompous for its gatefold cover that opened to show their initals that were as large as the albums themselves.

B004EQAVHI|5.0|This heart breaking film is one of the most over looked films of 2010 & also one of the best. I rank this right alongside \\"Inception\\" & \\"The Social Network\\" as the best of '10. However is also very elusive & opaque except for the emotional kick which builds like a slow forming tsunami before it crushes you. I have not been this wrecked by a movie since \\"The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button\\".   The 3 central performances by Carrey Mulligan, Kiera Knightley & Andrew Garfield (again) are elegaic & deeply moving.   It is about as anti-commercial of a film as I've seen in quite a while. It is a sci-fi film without any of the hardware. The futuristic concepts are never explicitly spelled out. You have to bring your brain to this movie.   But this film is about about emotions: innocence lost, youth betrayed & love never fully realized (for better and worse).    Word-of-mouth & a cult following will one day make this film a classic (ala \\"BladeRunner\\"). I know I'll be talking about it tomorrow and beyond.

Me being a spanish speaking person, while watching the movie also found numerous mistakes on the subtitles making some scenes incomprehensible, so in my opinion a bit more work on the revision of these details would make this a perfect edition, but besides that everithing is A+.   If you like cult films, you will fall in love with this beutiful disturbing and sad movie, it takes you trough diferent stages and emotions of a highly disturber man, based on his traumatic childhood.

0061726826|5.0|My Thoughts: Honestly, I didn't think anything Oliver could write could outshine Before I Fall. I really loved Before I Fall. But I loved Delirium way more. When I first read the description I knew I had to read it. I am a hopeless romantic so the concept seemed so intriguing. I had to learn more about Oliver's world of no love. Would heartbreak end from love? Or would it just enforce more heartbreak? How can you truly be happy if love is out of the question?<br /><br />We are introduced to Lena who lives in a society where love (delirium nervosa) is frowned upon. At the age of 18, everyone undergoes a procedure to take away all emotions leading to love. Lena is 17 so her time is coming. She just wants to get it over with, she wants to be cured. It's all she has ever known and going against the government would result in dire consequences. But Lena agrees for the most part, she just wants to get it over with so she does not end up like her mother. We are introduced to all of the side characters. We meet Lena's family; the only family she has left after her mother, whom was claimed by delirium nervosa which led up to her death. We meet Lena's best friend Hanna. I really liked her best friend. She reminded me a lot of the girls I hung out with during my teens. The relationship between them was beautiful, they were there for each other like best friends should be. We are than introduced to Alex, who tells Lena he's already been cured so its safe to hang out with him. Of course Lena starts to have feelings for Alex. I loved Alex. At first glance, at first wink, I adored his character. He was sincere, sweet, and he was an all around good guy despite the rumors about those who were outsiders.<br /><br />The relationship between Alex and Lena was beautiful. Beautiful I tell you! Nothing could compare to the way they treated each other. When Lena is caught holding hands with another guy (the guy she is to be married to after the cure) instead of getting possessive Alex goes and tries to do a good thing for Lena. He was unselfish and thoughtful. Alex and Lena decide that they must take the next step to be together and even though it is very risky, they love each other so they know they can not exist in this society and must find a way out.<br /><br />I read Delirium right after Matched by Allie Condie and even though they were both set in a somewhat dystopian world, I liked Delirium more than Matched. Matched felt more dystopian while Delirium felt more worldly, even though the laws existed. I started Delirium and I didn't stop once even though it was 450ish pages. Delirium was marvelous and Oliver sure has an imagination! Be prepared to cry and have the tissues handy. Delirium is a epic love story full of emotion and how one choice (to be in love or not to be) could effect the rest of your life.<br /><br />Overall: Loved it! A must read for 2011. Get your wallets ready and rush out and buy this one right now!<br /><br />Cover: It's neat. It's somewhat plain but really neat.<br /><br />What I'd Give It: 5/5 Cupcakes<br /><br />Taken from Princess Bookie (blog)a good thing for Lena. He was unselfish and thoughtful.

0062007297|1.0|If you wanna get some good photos of Bon Jovi, this book will accomplish that. The photos are indeed very good. SO, why, the harsh rating? Simple: the text.<br /><br />The text is shallow. It's a totally self-congratulatory and ego-driven narrative by the band members. I almost choked while I was reading it.<br /><br />A big, big dissapointment. Acurious fact: I bought the book to read about a band that I like, and finisht it thinking about never buying anything from them ever (and even looking suspiciously at their back catalogue).
B0049GYXDG|5.0|Disney continues its slow roll-out of its classic animated features on Bluray; this time, taking another tumble down the rabbit hole to view Alice in Wonderland in all its high-def glory. Rather than yet another review of a much-discussed classic film, I'll talk about the features unique to this latest re-release.    The digitally restored, high-def transfer is breathtaking in scope in that it seems not one frame was left un(re)touched and cleaned. The film sparkles with vibrancy and appears to have been shot yesterday. The colors seem to be as on-target and faithful as those in the Sleeping Beauty bluray. There is a 5.1 Dolby sound option that offers somewhat mixed results in the battle between modern sound-mixing techniques vs. 60 year old monaural masters. Purists can take it or leave; because a restored original monaural version is also offered on the disc.    There are actually few extras that weren't seen in previous dvd releases, but this version trumps them all with its \\"Through the Keyhole\\" option. This is a very unique commentary/documentary that can be played during the entirety of the film. It offers informative and chatty on-camera interviews with Disney and Carroll historians, generous with little-seen artwork. It plays more like a feature-length documentary than a dvd commentary, is loaded with witty and interesting commentators and is something that I hope dozens of other bluray producers take to heart and attempt to recreate for future releases.    The 1:85:1 aspect ratio of the film is misleading and confusing to many, it seems. The film has not been cropped; it absolutely appears in its original aspect ratio. The widescreen format only refers to the film as seen in \\"Disney View\\" option, which is an extra that adds an illustrated frame on either side of the original film. (Similar frames were used on the Snow White and Pinocchio blurays). The frame was created solely to placate those persons who'd otherwise freak out at the sight of blackness on the vertical sides of their widescreen televisions while viewing a 1:33:1 film. Film purists and the not-so-easily annoyed will be more than happy to ignore this feature completely.    As to the question of whether to upgrade; well, it depends on what you want from this film and how high it is on your list. As I said, \\"Through the Keyhole\\" is almost like a feature unto itself, is interesting and is probably worth the price of the disc itself. Seeing \\"Alice\\" in high-def, of course, is a glorious thing: unseen details pop out for the first time, background characters spring to life and the colors and timing are unsurpassed. Therefore, I give the disc 5 stars, remove my hat for the Disney technicians who worked so hard on faithfully restoring this film and engineering it for bluray, and hope that you will join me in enjoying this release.
B002VPE1PW|5.0|I wanted a sleeve for my Dell Inspiron Duo that would protect it from weather and provide some cushion and keep my computer safe. I was worried that the Dell Inspiron Duo might be too big for standard sleeves due to the border around the screen that makes this netbook bigger than most other netbooks. I found this sleeve by Amazon and figured I'd try it out. When I first got it, I didn't think it would fit, but it does! I can't use the straps, but the computer stays in there pretty well anyway. I was skeptical about the inside being orange because I thought it might clash with the blue color of my computer, but it doesn't and I really like the bold orange inside. It gives it some unexpected flair. It's a great product made my Amazon and I highly recommend it!
1594202842|5.0|I'm a first generation Korean-American immigrant; like Amy Chua, a Harvard educated \\"Tiger Dad\\" raising two cubs. I see the mirror reflections of myself in reading her book, and I understand it all too well what it takes to be a Tiger Dad from a similar cultural point of view. I've taken many of same steps as Chua, too. Up to a certain point, that is. I have two boys who, like Sophia and Lulu, are straight-A students. My thirteen year-old plays piano and viola while the eleven year-old plays piano and violin. Like Lulu, too, the younger one started violin early on (when he was five), is the youngest concertmaster of his youth orchestra (where his older brother is principal violist) and won a respectable string concerto competition when he was ten. No, I didn't make my boys practice four to six hours a day; and I never made them take their instruments along on our family vacations. Yes, they still play their instruments - with growing passion. I hope Lulu picks up her violin again someday - of her own accord, that is.<br /><br />The most brilliant thing about Chua's book is the timing itself. Whether intentional or not, it comes at a most critical period -- when the U.S. education system is being seen as dilapidated with a litany of disappointing reports and studies of how the U.S. kids are faring poorly in comparison to their international counterparts. The latest major report to hit the mass media, Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) rankings, prompted Arne Duncan, U.S. Secretary of Education, to call the study \\"an absolute wake-up call to America.\\" Throw in the current state of national anxiety in the widespread perception of the Decline and the Fall of American Empire vis-&agrave;-vis the rapidly rising superpower, China, you can see the inspirational source of Chua's dare.<br /><br />Chua's Battle Hymn is either a source of deep pride or utter embarrassment to Chinese-Americans, as evidenced by highly polarized reactions among them. The reason for such dramatically divergent receptions among Chinese-Americans is entirely Chua's fault: while Chua thinks and writes as if she represents a typical product of Chinese-American education system, Confucian values, traditions, and philosophy, she fails to understand the simple differentiation between the \\"Chinese way\\" and \\"Amy's way.\\" The fact that she lumps these into the same package, \\"Chinese Mother,\\" is what riled so many Chinese and Asian-American readers. Indeed, they recognize much of the \\"Chinese way\\" in what she says and does. But then when Chua crosses the Chinese border into the unfamiliar land of \\"Mommie Dearest,\\" there's the cultural disconnect.<br /><br />It's quite ironic that the book starts off with the three year old Sophia being able to recognize the words in the title of Sartre's famous play, No Exit. Little did she and Lulu know at the time that the existential play was really going to be about their own future scripts, the characters on actual life's stage torturing one another: \\"l'enfer, c'est les autres\\" (\\"Hell is other people.\\") At one point Chua says, \\"Even I had to admit that it sometimes got hard.\\" Either utter foolishness or remarkable candor, she made sure she's the cynosure at every page. \\"I'm sure it's [the book] all about you anyway,\\" as Lulu sarcastically but correctly mutters. Chua's vicarious living through her daughters is simply explained away as justifiable \\"because in Chinese thinking, the child is the extension of the self.\\" Yes, especially if the child happens to be of the dispensable and malleable female gender.<br /><br />What Chua meant by \\"bitter clash of cultures\\" is most poignantly surfaced when Chua discusses Florence, her mother-in-law, and her way of raising children. One thing that is glaringly missing in all this is the question of Jed, Chua's husband. Even by self-glorifying Chua's own accounts, the readers can deduce that he's arguably more intelligent, accomplished and talented - and here's the kicker - he's more balanced, EQ, IQ, and otherwise, than Chua. I suspect that Jed was born in the Year of the Pig and not in the Year of the Monkey. Whatever the year of his Chinese zodiac, he provided the badly needed stability in his, I mean, her, household.<br /><br />For a highly intelligent woman like Chua, it's rather surprising that she was so viscerally opposed to Florence who brought up an enviously successful son, Jed. A tree can be told by the fruits it bears. So if Jed is more successful and well balanced than Chua, wouldn't it then make sense to pay attention to what Florence has to say about how to raise successful and well balanced children? If Chua had listened to her for once, then I'm sure Florence would have had her greatest wish fulfilled before her death, namely, having just one full day to spend with each of her granddaughters. That was heartbreaking. Apparently, the Confucian virtue of filial piety only applies to the Chinese side of her family. As Chua herself mused at one point, what would her girls think about all this twenty years from now? What would the girls think about their own childhood? Chua saw \\"childhood as a training period, a time to build character, and invest for the future.\\" By contrast, Florence believed that \\"childhood should be full of spontaneity, freedom, discovery, and experience.\\" Who's right, the Chinese mom or the Western mom? The simplest answer is: both. How each parent balances the best of both worldviews and then adapts carefully to each individual child according to his or her personality and aptitude is the daily struggle and the real challenge.<br /><br />Although Chua didn't herself know why she spent a good portion of the book on her dogs, and didn't have the answer to Sophia's question, \\"Why are they in the book?,\\" it's hard to avoid the feeling that, in spite of her self-mocking and self-parodying humor, Chua was training her own daughters in many ways akin to Pavlov's dogs. Children are not born tabula rasa, a blank slate upon which parents can leave whatever egotistical or vicarious paw prints they want to make. For all the hours Chua shackles her daughters to this controlled learning, for all the hours she unwittingly robs them of other areas of critical and significant development. Chua proudly lists thirty-nine major cities around the globe to which she and Jed took their daughters by the time they were just twelve and nine. But other than being able to recite them alphabetically by memory, what have Sophia and Lulu gotten out of their impressive globetrotting? Other than remembering how they had to practice their instruments in each of these trips in a hotel, bitter fights with mom that dragged on long enough to miss museum's visiting hours and dinner? What do they remember in terms of people they've met, the cultural differences, customs, foods, languages? In other words, what have they experienced? Would they turn out to be \\"well rounded\\" like Chua herself wants them to become - if she understands what that means at all? Or age well into emotionally stunted adults by a lack of interpersonal people management, group dynamics, and socio-political navigating skills that would only steer them into safer Ivory Tower career havens in New Haven?<br /><br />Only after a series of costly pyrrhic battles that culminated at a restaurant in Russia with her final capitulation, Chua, to her credit, saw that nothing is worth losing her daughter. Witnessing her favorite younger sister, Katrine, who had devoted all her childhood and youth in training for a successful future Chinese style, pouring everything she had into earning three Harvard degrees and a promising career at Stanford, only to be faced with the grim prospect of losing it all to leukemia. Watching Katrine valiantly fighting off the disease, hanging dearly onto each day and savoring every minute of her remaining mortality with her own young children, Chua must have seen how precious and fleeting life is.<br /><br />Chua's Battle Hymn best serves as a significant, thought-provoking case study (for which reason I'm giving it 5 stars) as a warning to us all parents that any form of extreme parenting, Chinese or Western, is not the answer. Remember, Battle Hymn \\"was SUPPOSED to be a story of how Chinese parents are better at raising kids than Western ones.\\" So, perhaps it's now Jed's turn to speak?us paw prints they want to make.

This is the first time I have been able to create \\"bakery\\" quality bread.  Having grown up in the San Francisco Bay area, I have tried many many great breads.  This is the first time I have been able to produce a bread that I consider to be perfect. Although I read through the process for making your own starter, I took the quicker route and just bought mine from King Arthur Flour.

The book is wonderful already, but Spacek's comfortable, wistful Southern accent is the perfect accompaniement.  Do yourself a favor (and for goodness' sake, help a struggling reader if this is a class assignment) and listen all over again.  I am a teacher who does assign this book upon occassion, and playing selections from this audio version is an instant hit.  Students love to borrow my copy!
0671207822|5.0|I read this book for extra credit in a psychology class and it's now among my favorites! Frankl uses his real life experiences from a concentration camp to explain what people value in life. Through these experiences he helps to explain exactly what it is that man looks for. Through this book I found it was easier to define what was really important to me, and even how to achieve those goals. This book is a huge eye opener and a fantastic read!
B003UYV08E|3.0|It seemed like there was too much going on.  I had to rewind a couple of times to figure out how the characters tie into each other.

B0034G4OXQ|5.0|This film is my immediate favourite film of the year. It had me totally involved and I found at the end I had been sitting on the edge of my seat for most of the film. It is a long while since a film has done that. In this era when movies are mostly about action and blowing things up comes a movie that has action and does blow things up, but is in essence a peaceful , thoughtful, heartfelt treatise on life and death and dying. Eastwood is a better director now than he has ever been, he has grown up from his big kid western adventure days and his movies now address the most thoughtful and important issues known to man. The last six years he has given us \\"Mystic River\\", \\"Gran Torino\\" and this, along with many other films of strong if variable quality. He is now the master film maker. This film actually delivers up a Matt Damon who is sensitive and acts and his story is the centre piece of this master work. I believe this film will expose audiences, those who are cynical, ignorant and dont have a strong understanding of human connection (which is ultimately what the movie is about, the healing of troubled souls and the connections we make on this earth)will hate it. Those who embrace life and all it offers and find the question of the after life fascinating will love it, the cynics should go and watch an action flick. This is a master piece that has already been over looked in America. It will grow in stature and reputation over the years.

B004H8ZQKU|5.0|A few years ago, I read a book that kept me thinking for a long time: It prompted discussions amongst booksellers, and avid readers alike. It had me wondering about the possibilities. I thought about where it was set, I thought about the origin and home land of the author. In fact, I pondered many, many aspects and nuances. Much like how the characters in the movie had been portrayed, I found myself struck speechless, staring out upon my world, mouth slightly agape... and I wondered.    Among the thoughts that blanketed my mind, were thoughts as basic and as interesting as the human condition itself; Of what elements had I been composed, modeled and resolved? What is my essence, and how am I so able to connect to others. What separates us?   Of course it would be no small feat for an actor to portray such abstract concepts. But the director chose wisely, and the actors probably made him proud.    Perhaps, my only discomfort with the movie and its direction was the -too often used- shot from a distance.  I got the point but it felt a bit like the visual attempt at the portrayal of the book seemed to grasp uncomfortably while they book allowed my queries to flow...(I laugh!) unimpeded by art! I recommend: see both!

1592332803|5.0|I first found out about Colleen Patrick-Goudreau via a \\"Compassionate Cooking\\" presentation and gathering at my local Unitarian Universalist Church, presented by friends who had been vegan for a few years after slowly transitioning from traditonal to vegetarian to vegan cuisine.  Along with the savory items offered at the gathering such as Eggless Egg Salad, Colleen's recipe of Chocolate Chip Cookies were part of the buffet, and they were absolutely delicious - still are!<br />  When I became aware she was going to publish \\"Joy of Vegan Baking\\", I bought it soon after it was available.<br />  Now, one of the other reviewers finds this cookbook boring and bland, and not creative at all.  I find this cookbook to be a cornerstone for vegan baking in that it takes conventional recipes and turns them into delicious vegan fare, food for everyone to enjoy, not just a specific select group of food-lovers.  Many of us have our favorite desserts and snacks, and when we decided to make the transition to vegan cuisine, we were in need of such a cookbook.  I've been vegan for some time but, in the \\"early days\\" of my personal vegan mission, I was hard-pressed to find an actual vegan cookbook.  In \\"these wonderful days\\" the selection is phenomenal with Colleen's \\"Joy of Vegan Baking\\" at the forefront with a collection of delicious, fun, inventive, compassionate fare.<br />  I've used it time and time again, and will continue to use it to the delight of myself, and everyone else I bake for as they love (and devour) the finished products of this cookbook.  I love it when first-timers, after tasting a cake, cookie, etc., argue with me - they are convinced dairy and eggs are involved!  No, just deliciousness, thoughtfulness, and compassion.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I think that Suzanne Collins wrote an amazing series that is adventurous, daring, and definitely will leave you on the edge of your seat! She combines so many topics that will appeal to all audiences, such as fighting, friendship, choices, and even a little romance.

I loved this series and is great for teachers, parents, adults, kids, teens, and anyone else willing to read it. I must admit I was reluctant to read such violent material, but when I finally did, I had found my favorite book of all time!
1563898586|3.0|I was predisposed to love The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Vol. 1, as alternate history is a favorite genre, and famous character mash-ups a particular favorite as well. Volume One introduces a \\"menagerie\\" (as they are often referred to) of otherwise famous literary characters brought together to help Queen and Country with dangerous tasks in a somewhat steampunky Britain of an alternative history. Two characters, Mina Murray and Allan Quatermain, are favorites of mine from their original novels and I loved the idea of them having more adventures.<br /><br />This graphic novel has many literary references, both in the text and illustrations, which is a delight for a book nerd. The pseudo-Victorian style and parody of Victorian serials used throughout the novel was highly amusing for a fan of that era and added an extra level of enjoyment.<br /><br />Character development and setting introduction took the first few chapters (\\"issues\\") and was pretty well done. The personalities of the five members of the League were nicely established and tantalizing hints given about the world from both the illustrations and the text. I became quite fond of the characters, even the amoral Griffin, and was eagerly awaiting plot development.<br /><br />When the plot did develop, however, it was unsatisfying. Perhaps because so much time had been spent developing characters and world, very little time was able to be given to generate a decent plot. It was a messy, mishmash of explosions and overaction (not to mention overacting) and made very little sense. If it was meant to be a parody of Victorian fiction, it didn't read like any of the multitude of Victorian novels I have read.<br /><br />The art was nothing spectacular. While there were some scenes drawn with \\"hidden\\" references, these occasional treats did nothing to add to the story. The illustration of the panels is a very straightforward, comic book style, with no artistic angles or composition. The lines are harsh, the backgrounds busy, the colors generally unappealing. There were even times when panels were so busy with so many irrelevant details, that it was hard to find the action. I certainly did not feel that I was reading a graphic novel where the art is vital to the storyline; I felt as though I were reading a comic book.<br /><br />Despite my interest in the characters, the lack of a real plot line and the average art made this very promising premise a mediocre read. I truly am interested in the characters, though, and may still give the second volume a try to see if Moore and O'Neill were simply getting established with this volume.generally unappealing.

0783225903|5.0|When this originally came out way back when, it was before its time.  I do not remember how many times I paid to see it in the theaters.  Now I have added it to my collection.  I have always enjoyed the art of the film.  When it came out, I really did not grasp the story it was telling.  Now that I am older, I see the direction this film was going in, because we are not too far behind it now.  I have no idea why this was titled Brazil because it has nothing to do with Brazil.  The movie is about a big socialist government, into your business all the time.  You are told how to act, dress, live and work.  I like this movie because even though we are faced with big brother watching us, you cannot take away the desire for freedom and individualism.
B0036S4CTS|4.0|Again, a new author for me. I really have no particular method for picking books. I select my books by: 1, reading the  \\"blurb's\\" and pick one the strikes me as interesting, 2. making sure it isn't too expensive or 3. heard/read a recommendation in various media outlets.  I must say that this book was well written and very emotionally moving! By the end I was just bawling... but I won't say why. You need to read it to figure that out! The story of two people linked together for almost a life time can seem contrived at times but David Nicholls manages to make these characters and their story believable and relatable. Many of us have or had that one person in our lives that has effected us and who we are. That one person that you cannot escape no matter what; for better or worse. It almost seemed like a guilty pleasure reading about the relationship and lives of these two characters; almost as if you were a fly on the wall. You become invested in these characters and the story. You will be surprised how fast the day goes by while reading it. I was so enthralled by this book that I stayed up until 2am to finish it.  My only reason for not giving it 5 stars was I think that there were some parts that could have been whittled down or just plain left out. There were a few sections in the middle that I found myself wanting to just skip over and felt wasn't imperative to the plot of the story, but that could just be part of my ADD qualities! Overall, defiantly a good read! I plan on checking out more of David Nicholls stories in the near future!

It is also very convenient to carry around as it fits in the belt.  The cushioning is really good, and as a result this is not the one that will fit in quietly in a corner of a bag.  I would any day trade in the space it consumes to the protection it provides.
B003YWUTJI|2.0|This isn't what I want to hear from Nora Jones. Guess I'm spoiled by her earlier albums and style. Didn't like the rap. Some songs are more 'the other artist' than Nora. Others, especially \\"Dear John\\" just didn't work. On that track it seemed their voices never got together. It was a mess! My opinion anyway.
B000A2IPP0|5.0|This movie is a classic.  For the era, the special effects are great and the acting was VERY well done.  I still find myself quoting some of the lines from the movie.
0439023521|4.0|There were things that I loved and things I hated about this book. I hopped on the Hunger Games train a lot later than most of my fellow book bloggers, but thanks to all of you I was convinced I had to give it a try.    When I was writing this review I made a pros and cons list, because I kept sitting down to write it and ending up with 2-3 pages worth of gushing and ranting. Maybe it's that The Hunger Games is so widely known, and everyone already has something to say about it...     So anyway, let's talk characters.    The characters truly made the story for me. Don't get me wrong, the plot was made of awesomesauce, but the characters are what I won't be forgetting anytime soon.    Peeta...where have you been all my life? If i go in-depth about Peeta it's just going to make me sound like a bubbling fan girl. So I'll just say that i was very impressed by Peeta.    Katniss Everdeen, is my hero. You don't know how relieved I was to finally find a self-reliant female young adult character. I kind of feel like I'm complaining but with all the YA romances it's getting a little annoying how many Bella Swans are popping up (no offense to the twi-hards). Although Katniss gets her emotions mixed up a lot I feel that she's a great role model for young girls.    Rue was a character who's role at first may seem small, but later on it becomes apparent that she makes a big impact not only on Katniss, but on all of Panem. Rue was one of my favorite characters and when she died it brought me to tears.     What i hated about this book was all the violence. I'm not one to complain about a little blood here and there. The wild dogs tearing people apart limb by limb i could handle but did a little girl really have to get killed? Yes i know it sets up a lot of the story...but still that scene was just heartbreaking, no matter how you cut it.     In the arena everything changes. The ones who make it out are changed forever. Some of those scenes were so intense I'm almost convinced theychanged me just by reading them.     The Hunger Games was an interesting, complicated and sometimes scary story. It was one of the best starts to a series I've seen in a while.

B0025UHKNS|4.0|I guess I am a simplistic runner.  I want to slip on my shoes and hit the road.  But in the realm of milage tracking and trying to improve performance I wanted to know how far I am really running and at what pace etc.  This Garmin seemed like the ideal, GPS tracking of mileage, HR monitor, pace/lap virtual monitor.  WOW so many features I needed 3 days to get it set up and I'm still not sure I have all the bells and whistles working properly!  What I don't like is that it seems to take forever to track the satellites to get the GPS up and running then once I finally get that after 5 minutes it drops the dam things again and starts searching all over again! Dam the orbits and all!  Then I just want to see time, distance and HR, Good so I set up those data fields and think I am good.  Nope.  Get ready to run Turn on GPS wait 5 minutes to get aquainted with the satellites then try and find my training data field but all the watch wants to let me do is run against my virtual partner (who I don't really care about to be honest!) after much random \\"bezelling\\" I somehow magically and mistakenly come across my running profile that I set up and hit start timer and lock the bezel so I don't screw it up again, start to run and then after about 5 minutes notice that hey the distance isn't tracking!  Well guess what lost the GPS again so we start again to try to find the satellites, find them I lose my profile, and I am so pissed off at this point I don't care anymore and I just run 'cause this blasted $260 toy has just cost me a half hour of my running time and as a working mom, I don't have a lot of time to dink around.  Not every day is this bad but just be aware this is not a simple thing to operate and you are going to need to read the manual multiple times.  Over all I get it to work for me now about 80% of the time I have had it for 2 months so who knows maybe we just need more time to get aquainted!!!  Over all I think it is a good product just wish it was a bit more user friendly and easier to operate!

B002VECM6S|5.0|Well done movie!  How can you save all the children?  Regardless of their age.  This movie is not just about football.  It is about the potential of every person.  This movie shows that not everyone is seeking a handout.  Some have just been handed the crappy end of the stick and are stuck.  This kid was very humble, and I hope he remembers to always be humble.  I have to remind myself to be humble.  He had a great teacher/student.  Awesome movie!
0439023491|5.0|Having read the entire hunger games trilogy prior to writing this review, I have to say that Catching Fire was my favorite out of all three books.<br /><br />The characters go through an even tougher emotional struggle in Catching Fire than they do in the first book. The struggles they go through suck you in completly as you read them. Not only do we get Peeta and Katniss back we get a whole new cast of characters introduced that I fell for instantly. Yes I'm talking about Finnick, but I'm also talking about the old lady from his district, and fox-girl.<br /><br />Let's not forget President Snow, now that I know how he ends in the last book I won't rant about his horribleness too much. I know you're supposed to hate his character...but I'll say it anyway: I HATED Snow, he was completely whacked! Props to Collins for dreaming up such a slimy villain.<br /><br />The element of surprise was in the authors favor.Who would've thought after The Hunger Games that Katniss and Peeta would get swept back into the arena? I know I didn't see that coming. And then you have all of those returning Hunger Games champions fighting each other? It was intense to say the least, and pretty violent too.<br /><br />My favorite part of this book was actually the clock. I won't spoil it for you if you haven't read this book already...but make sure you keep an eye out. I was impressed and enchanted by that bit...as well as a little horrified.<br /><br />Catching Fire fills in gaps and answers questions, It sets you up for the next installment, but it also takes you on a ride. At this point The Hunger Games is a series that just keeps getting better...<br /><br />Collins writing in Catching Fire depicts raw emotion. Believable and relatable as well as insane and scary things happen in this book. Catching Fire will kidnap your mind, and won't let you go until you've read every last word.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I needed a good book to get me back into reading and this did the trick.  I thought the first half was better than the last half of the story but overall I really enjoyed it.  I one hundred percent say \\"buy it\\".
1592332803|5.0|I bought this as a fledgling vegan and it was such a wonderful resource.  It and VCTOTW helped make me a GREAT baker.  There are lovely photos, great sidenotes, and the intro section about how to bake, vegan substitutions, etc, is so helpful.  I also love the apple chart that tells you which apples are good for pies, sauce, etc.  The only bummer is the binding, which makes it hard to lie the book flat.  That may have changed by now though (I bought my copy back in 2007)    My favorite recipes include: the peanut butter cookies, the chocolate chip cookies (OMG so good), the cornbread, the apfelkuchen, the chocolate-almond smoothie, and the lemon cheesecake.

0439023521|5.0|i finished the trilogy a few weeks ago. it took me a few days to finish the three books and i am so happy that i came across the hunger games. truly one of the best series i have ever read.    i'm not going to be too detailed because spoilers are annoying in reviews, even if you're warned. i think you can go to the discussion section to talk about crap.    i'm 25 years old and i came across this book because a 7th grader in a class i was assisting in had it. i thought it looked interesting so i went out to get a copy. best idea of my life. i fell in love with the characters quickly. suzanne collins is a wonderful author who captured my heart. in all honesty, i haven't felt like this in a while about characters in a book. she brought me in and made me care. the storyline is great although at times it was a bit difficult to handle emotionally.    what i wish someone would have told me before reading this series is that it is NOT a love story. it's easy to forget that. but i think it's important to keep in the back of your mind, especially when you get to the third book.
B003BW0CB6|1.0|If Kindle can't bring the prices of books like this one down I will go back to haunting the used book stores.  This is certainly not the best work by this author and relatively short for good measure.  I actually wonder if Michael has a ghost writer these days.  Not a bad read for around $6.00 but not anywhere near worth the price they are charging.  Simply put, I felt ripped off.

B004BLJQOK|3.0|I really thought this would be a good horror movie I could add to my collection.  Sadly, it is just a good movie with some gore in it.  A bit predictable as well.  Thankfully it is not a sappy movie like \\"Twilight\\" and unfortunately not scary like \\"A Haunting in Connecticut.\\"  So what, the vampire child gives the wimpy kid some advise on dealing with bullies, it really did not work.  And as predicted, she comes to his defense in the end.  Stephen King added his two cents \\"the best horror movie in 20 years.\\"  Really???  It is just a good story.  Some of the reviews on Amazon say that the American remake has more special effects.  If that is true, then I won't waste my time watching the original.  Kids are great in creepy movies and have the potential to make the movie that much more creepier or fun.  This movie failed at both ends.  It was just a good story with an open end.
1594202842|5.0|I totally disagree with some of her opinions!  And I am Chinese. For instance, an 'A' is not important to me at all since its all relative.  I can get C but if the rest of the class fail, that is good enough for me. And I cannot relate to why playing an instrument exceedingly well is important, if playing it \\"good enough\\" can help me get a scholarship. The time is better spent studying! Can you earn a decent living from playing music??!    I was being neurotic and tongue-in-cheek (although I was often first in school, and I m a doctor now). I think that the political incorrectness in her book is self-deprecating and more for laughs. I am sure she embellished quite a fair bit. So do not take the book too seriously.    I do believe that her core beliefs of setting high standards for her kids that was mentioned repeatedly in the books are reasonable if you could see things from her perspective. Sophia and Lulu are kids of 2 Yale Law Professors and they have the genetic potential of achieving great academic success. She probably felt that she needed to put in more effort to engineer their success.    Overall, she wrote really well and I could not put the book down. It is a must-read for people who were very competitive as students and get a lot of gratification from being first in class. We can best relate to her!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This bag is about the perfect size for my cameras and accessories. I have 5 lenses, 2 bodies, flashes, diffusers, and so much more. I really wanted something that could hold everything that I would need when I went out on a shoot and this worked perfectly.<br /><br />The bag is well padded for the the camera and the user. This makes it much more comfortable.. because camera equipment can be really heavy and uncomfortable after a while.<br /><br />The bag fits all of my needs and then some.<br /><br />The only argument I had against it was a small one... the aesthetics. It wasn't as pretty as it could be but it still looks professional enough.<br /><br />THE PRICE was amazing for this bag. For it's size and comfort and durability it was well worth the price. Overall I would give this bag a rating of 4.75  out of 5.0  it was a great deal and I would have bought it again! I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Small cons:<br />Camera equipment will always be heavy. This bag doesn't change that.<br />I wish there was a place to put a laptop!
0452295548|5.0|I bought this book for my sister in law because her husband suffered a mild stroke in November. I decided to get a copy for myself because when recommended to me it was spoken so highly of. It was insiteful and interesting for anyone to read and extremely well written. I read it in two days while traveling and it made the time go so quickly I've passed it along to several family members and friends.
B0034G4OY0|5.0|Hereafter is a European art-house movie with Hollywood production values.   It's yet another Eastwood movie that ranks as the best American film of the   year because it engages both heart & mind with its tale of three individuals   in different parts of the world disconnected from life by a brush with death.     In Paris, famous TV reporter Marie (a luminous Cecile deFrance) briefly  dies during a horrific natural disaster & has a vision of what she  suspects may be the afterlife. Back home she can't get the experience  out of her mind & her obsession threatens her high-flying career &  friendships. In San Francisco, lonely, middle-aged factory worker  George (Matt Damon) can talk to the dead but his 'gift' makes it  impossible for him to form relationships with people. Finally, on a  grim housing estate in South London, young brothers Marcus & Jason  (George & Frankie McClaren) try to fend off social workers from taking  their druggie Mum (Lyndsey Marchal) away. But when tragedy strikes  Marcus finds himself all alone & desperate to speak to his beloved  brother one more time.     This is Eastwood's quietest film & one of his very best. The director  has always exhibited a fondness for emphasising character over plot but  here he goes further than ever before, luxuriating in the lives and   surroundings of these three very different people. Hereafter has almost   no plot, a third of it is subtitled, there's no villain, the film asks   questions without supplying answers, the actors don't 'act' in any   Hollywood sense of the term, the most spectacular scene comes right at the   start instead of at the end, & death is the starting point for both the  characters & the story rather than the climax.     All things that are clearly going to alienate a section of the movie-  going public simply because they're so unaccustomed to experiencing  that. And yet the same film features three ordinary people - not the  buffed up superheroes of so much contemporary American cinema - the  mood isn't one of overriding anger or self-pity (again, as so much  modern American cinema tends to be) but compassionate & thoughtful,  kind of contemplative, & in its quietness remarkably compelling. As the  critic Roger Ebert noted, it induces in the viewer something  akin to the feeling of a reverie.     The actors are extraordinary. Matt Damon gives the best performance  I've ever seen from him. His lonely psychic who aches for human contact  & goes to sleep listening to Dickens audio books is so heartfelt you  find yourself completely rooting for him but at the same time it's a  totally unshowy performance. That same low key quality applies in fact  to the whole cast. Cecile deFrance, looking a little like a young Julie  Christie, is simply terrific here, both intelligent & vulnerable, & the  McClaren twins have a rawness & authenticity that just works.     The craft side is equally impressive with the film moving smoothly  between the three story lines in 10 min chunks thanks to Eastwood's ace  editors Joel Cox & Gary Roach. Tom Stern's excellent photography gives  each setting - Paris, San Francisco & London - a distinct look & on the  musical side Eastwood himself contributes a lovely & sparingly used  piano piece.     Those fearing some sort of preachy Hollywood confection needn't worry.  Even Damon's psychic abilities are ambiguous. If you watch carefully  you'll note that he tells his subjects nothing they don't already know  or could have imagined themselves. Revealingly, what messages are  delivered all reinforce screenwriter Peter Morgan's key point; there's  no help to be had from the dead, you're on your own & what matters are  the connections you make in this life.    Morgan's script gives short-shrift to both organised religion & the  network of New Age frauds who profit from people's misery. One of the  more amusing sequences shows Marcus visiting a succession of con men  'psychics' each of whom offers increasingly ludicrous methods ofcontact with the afterlife. Yet if all that sounds coldly atheist and secular,   Morgan's script is deeply sympathetic towards the need for those   who've lost loved ones, not just to grieve, but to talk publicly about death, &   skewers a materialistic western culture that fears & sidelines   anyone who does.     Hereafter doesn't say there is an afterlife. It doesn't pretend to have  any answers, it simply asks the question & it does so with intelligence  & compassion. It tells a story about people under the shadow of death  yet comes down on the side of life, love & simple human connection, not  with ghosts, but with each other. I loved it.

B003L20IHE|3.0|I heard great things about this movie, so I had high expectations going in.  I have to say, I was disappointed.  It was a beautiful piece in regards to cinematography and storyline, but the actual substance of the movie was lacking.  The characters were distant, so the emotion of the movie fell short and the relationships seemed superficial (although, the first fifteen minutes were promising).  The movie was rather predictable, as well.  I'm just glad I rented it instead of bought it, and I advise others to do the same.  While, it's not a terrible movie, I really wouldn't want to watch it more then once or twice.
B004132HZS|5.0|By now, I'm guessing you're puzzled by the high rating I gave this set and my review title. Believe me, both are connected. Read on.    The title is accurate. Generally I hate, despise. detest and loathe when characters are updated, moved to different time periods, given 'spins' which usually resemble the swirling water down a toiler bowl. So, when I heard about Sherlock, I groaned. Here we go again: Whoosh!    But as a Holmes fan and award winning author who owes his trophy to the traditional Holmes story he penned, I sat down to watch this series pretty much with a hand clasped to my forehead, prepared to throw something at the TV and storm out of the room.    And yet the first of this series of TV movies held my attention. It wasn't great but Holmes was Holmes and seemed to fit modern London rather well. Watson wasn't quite right, I felt in the first of the three movies. The second film really stumbled, I thought although folks seem to like it the best of the lot. I didn't but thought the characters really took shape and Holmes, miracles of miracles, had been transposed to the modern day to this viewer's satisfaction. Again, take a glance at the title for this review.    Thus I eagerly awaited the third movie and, boy, was it worth the wait. To put it simply, the last movie in this set is one of the best Holmes movies EVER DONE! Absolutely brilliant. The whole thing clicked into place and had me riveted from scene one. I would recommend buying this set just for the last film! It's that good. How the creators here managed to transpose Holmes and Watson to the modern day and satisfy this viewer is nothing short of a miracle to me. But they did it and did it very well!    This is a must-have set for Holmes fans and I can't wait to see the future films currently in the works. Bravo!
B003UESJF6|4.0|The movie Mega Mind, by Tom McGrath, was one o the best animation movies of the year since Finding Nemo. It's an action, comedy, and silly yet a great animation that is worth the watch. As a Christian, talking about a secular movie, I would say that this movie is safe even for the younger ears in the family because they sugar code some inappropriate languages. The movie picked a perfect roll for the voice actors, the special effects in the animations, and a plot that keeps you interested through the whole movie.  The voice character's are all well known people who you can relate too when it comes to comedy. Will Ferrell was one of the voice actors and in fact he was playing the main character name Mega Mind. His voice fit perfectly for the character's personality. Will Ferrell had the voice of an evil genius during that role and with his comedian skills he had made the character flawless. A famous actor name Brad Pitt, who I have now see that he is more into comedy, decided to play the main hero of the story, Metro Man. At first in the story he had a little serious act for his role until you seen the whole movie. It had a good twist that will leave you laughing. Tina Fey, a well known comedian in Saturday Night Live, comes back from a retirement in SNL and surprises us by playing a role in Mega Mind, Roxanne. She played the typical girl character that all ways get kidnapped. The perfect part of her character is that she makes her character sarcastic and not like the woman that cries for help all the time, like in most super hero movies. In conclusion, these characters brought out the movie well, and of course the sub characters like Jonah Hill from \\"Get Him to Greek\\", and David Cross from \\"Alvin and the Chipmunks\\".   The special effects in the movie are something worth mentioning because it came out really well. The director, Tom McGrath, who was also know for Madagascar, made a perfect action sequence that even surpass The Incredible, in my opinion. Mega Mind action and special effects has brought something to the table, not even Superman, the movie, couldn't bring out to entertain most audiences. Although Mega Mind was suppose to bring out a \\"copy\\" of a Superman like storyline, it had made it to a story that will make you wish that was Superman's main story from the beginning. Mega Mind would have to be the best Villain / Hero of the year. The reason why I say this is because he just presented himself to the audience what a true genius he could be. You wouldn't find any bad guys that kids would love in a million years. One of the fiction character, played my Jonah Hill, name Tighten (Ironically not spelled as Titan). He was the character that shocked the audience. Tighten became someone or something you didn't expect to happen to him. With a nice twist, Tighten was the spice in the movie, the way he uses power and the special effect was just amazing. One aspect would be the obsession with Roxanne; he would do anything it takes to get her. The characteristic for Minion was very creative, the way they put him together. Minion, the side kick of Mega Mind, brings you back memories of the animation movie \\"Hercules\\". How Pegasus was with Hercules since born and been with him till the end, watching, and guiding him. That's how Minion but in an evil silly version. Voice actor David Cross, who was know for playing Dave's boss in \\"Alvin and the Chimp-monks\\", just made the character cute and very evil. He is just the perfect sick kick an evil villain can ask for, in a good way. Super Star Brad Pitt played the Former Hero of the story, or should I say Mega Mind's rival, Metro Man (Ironically name after the city they live in). Metro Man is what you would expect being Super man like. Seeing from the movie he is like imaging Super man giving up on all he has done just because he was tried of being a Super hero. It was nice to see that this character wasn't the main hero of the movie because it would have been too cliché. As I was saying,Metro Man was the character to boost up Mega Mind's appearance and appreciation  more then he was suppose to be and he made it happen. In conclusion, the special feature and the character background was just amazing put together.  If you were to watch any introduction of Super man movie you will see the semblance that Mega Mind uses. Mega Mind would be the satire version of Super Man the movie. But Brainiac would be the main character of the story. As a said before this plot would be like if everything goes wrong, bad guy wins and good guy loses. What I love about the plot is how Mega Mind has to change up his character since being a bad guy without a good guy made him nothing and lonely.  In conclusion, the story Mega Mind was an outstanding piece of comedy art that made it worth to watch, in my opinion. Having a well picked voice actors, neat special effects and an interesting plot uplifts the movie to a must watch with friends, a party, or with family. Any family can enjoy their favorite actor's voice, since they are so popular, without a doubt. Special effect will also surprise you and the audience because it feels so fresh. This story will keep you interested until the unfortunate ending of the movie. I would say that this movie is definite recommended.

0882709194|1.0|Darwin was quite brilliant, and \\"On the Origin of Species\\" is a great book for anyone interested in the preliminary theory of natural selection. His insight provides an interesting background for modern theories of evolution, and the meticulousness with which he presents his findings may provide useful insight for individuals interested in biological field research.    The introduction, on the other hand, is simply embarassing. Ray Comfort provides arguments that are illogical and irrelevant. He is disrespectful and shallow-minded to other religions in this introduction and adds absolutely nothing to Darwin's work. The only reason I could fathom anyone allowing this introduction to be published would be some non-religious individuals laughing to themselves about how the absurdity written by this man will turn people away from religion entirely, or perhaps some eccentric Darwin supporter who realized how much more intelligent Charles Darwin seems when juxtaposed to Ray Comfort. In addition, four chapters from Darwin's original work that described the evidence for evolution are omitted in this edition.    Unless you want this long-winded introduction as a guide for what to avoid doing when trying to produce an intellectual argument, buy a different version.

0439023521|5.0|Kept me hooked from beginning to end.  I am in my late 20s but still have a huge heart for junior fiction.  While there is quite a bit of violence, there are some deep morals woven in, but not so openly that it's a turn-off.  The storyline is unpredictable, and yet realistic at the same time.  A touch of romance, but not sickeningly sweet or senseless like the Twilight books. Mostly action that keeps you reading until you realize you've read all night long!

0307266303|5.0|This book helped me when I was having muscle problems and unable to run. It let me know that trail running is a fun way back to a healthy body. I love being on a trail running or hiking. It showed me running isn't all about keeping your times or being faster than someone else. It's about having fun and running because it's good for the head and body. I tried the five finger shoes, I will stick to my Asics, my stepdaughter loves them, my partners wierd toes don't fit in them. Read the book for what it is about \\"Running\\", then run whichever way is best for you.  This book is my 2010 favorite.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|Great movie. I saw it in theaters when it came out and i was not blown away by it; I thought it was good but not great. At the end on Jan I ordered it for some odd reason and I'm glad that i did. The visuals are great and the story is also better than i remember. If you are a sci-fi fan you owe it to yourself to at least watch it once.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|I saw this twice at the theatre and can't wait to see it on DVD, as well.  The acting is brilliant.  The story is brilliant.  The timing is exquisite --I mean to the SPLIT SECOND perfect.  The direction, editing, characterizations are all, well, brilliant.  Since we first saw it, there are so many scenes that my grown sons and I have re-played, re-told, quoted, joked about, discussed at length...... it's just simply a classic.  Yes, it is a bit on the gory side sometimes, but I'd say war is a pretty gory affair.  \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" sure had its gory moments, too, you know.<br /><br />Although this is totally fiction, it's certainly based on real WWII circumstances and characters.  We absolutely loved it.  We were disappointed the Academy Awards did not nominate it for more awards and that it did not win more. In my opinion, it was the most enjoyable film of 2009....  and one that will be watched and enjoyed again and again by fans of its genre for generations to come!
B002VECMAE|4.0|Personally, I find The Men Who Stared At Goats funny, but not Jack Black-funny or Will Ferell-funny, which is a good thing.    I'm impressed that the stars of this show did not try outshine each other. Each played his part well. I am particularly tickled by George Clooney's and Kevin Spacey's acting.    Job well done, soldiers.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought this because I need to get in shape for my wedding, it's only twenty minutes and there were great reviews.  I'm now ten days in and still sticking with the first level, due to a past injury relearning how to do a pushup has taken some time but I'm just about there.  Jillian seems to be just what I need to keep my butt in gear.  I've lost 7lbs in a week and a half!  I'm heavy, but not that heavy, I never thought that I would get more than 2lbs a week!    I've ordered one of her books and a couple of the other dvd's now.
B003F3NDP8|5.0|Overall, a really great season.     Susan, after so much drama and terrible experiences finally gets her happiness again, remarrying Mike Delfino, her show's regular beau. Lynette has to deal with her pregnancy and Bree with her affair with Karl Meyer, Susan's ex-husband. Gabrielle, now mother from last season, has another child to take care of, Carlos's neice, Ana, a troublesome teenager from the start.     Meanwhile, the most troubled housewife probably remains the one that isn't one: Katherine. Having to deal with Susan and Mike's relationship, and her own failed one, she isn't someone to be called stable in this season for those who are fans of her.     The show also introduces a new family onto Wisteria Lane: Angie Bolen, and interesting, historical last, name, fitting to the fiery spirit this mother has when protecting her family. Also included in this seasons wild showings is a plane crash right in the middle of the lane, and the reprecussions from that, as well as a mysterious strangler who begins to kill and hurt many of our girls.     Definitely a great season not to be missed.
B00004BZ16|5.0|...This is one of the best records (yes, that's what we used to call them) by one of the greatest bands ever. Accept no substitutes, accept no qualifications...this is a timeless, sprawling masterpiece.
B002XMGGK6|4.0|The show's great but in all honesty, I've seen better endings.    At the end, it seemed that Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) still could not fathom the bitter anger that Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) has felt. Neither did he appreciate the leniency that Clyde has given (by not killing him or his family).    My heart sank for Clyde.
B002ZG99N6|5.0|Ben Affleck's second directorial effort, The Town (after the brilliant debut \\"Gone Baby Gone\\") is another thrilling, suspenseful film.  The movie had me fully engaged from the first few seconds, through the very ending, where the only known is that a lot of people are gonna get hurt, but how many?     I found myself so caught up in the film, I was fearful for the safety of the assistant bank manager who becomes Affleck's girl friend; worrying that if she ever successfully identified Affleck as the bank robber, then Affleck's buddy (Jeremy Renner) would probably end up killing her.      I hope Affleck continues to write and direct movies, he seems to be good at it.  Also, his acting, which was extremely annoying for so long, has matured to the point where he is okay on the screen (although he's still not what I would call a great actor). The Town is gripping, tense stuff, very nicely done.  However, as one reviewer on this site pointed out, \\"The Town\\" would have been a lot better if he hadn't seen \\"Heat\\" first.  The Town is really good, but Heat is a total classic.
B00002ZMNV|5.0|I had the cd already but wanted to see it live. It is fantastic. I was almost like being there in person.
B000M9BPEY|5.0|In Big Fish (2003)--what if you think your daddy has told you nothing but tall tales which you prefer to call lies? A son thinks his father is a blowhard who can't be honest with him. Edward Bloom (Albert Finney in a kind of Southern accent) loves to tell stories that he perhaps embellishes and exaggerates, but maybe not that much. There may be more than a kernel of truth in those tales. But, at any rate, this causes a rift and separation between the father and his son William Bloom (played by Billy Crudup, a frequent Broadway player). The senior Edward Bloom as a youth is played by Ewan McGregor. He's a winning actor you can't help liking because of his smile and his openness. As a youngster Edward Bloom saw his death in a witch's eye.<br /> The movie is part fantasy and part realism. Along the way there are monsters, giants, man-wolves, a witch, an enormous catfish, a phantom town, and other amazing sights.<br />Danny De Vito plays a circus ringmaster, Steve Buscemi plays one of Bloom's neighbors who is living in a dreamlike utopian town, and Helena Bonham Carter plays a witch and a woman who is in love with Will. Jessica Lang plays Finney's adoring wife.<br /> The movie creates a pleasant mood, a fairy tale-like atmosphere. It has an upbeat ending, and I don't know why exactly but the movie reminded me of Forrest Gump; this film has that same kind of romantic and sentimental flavor.<br /> It was directed by Tim Burton who often deals in fantasies and oddball stuff. He's provided some eccentric roles for Johnny Depp. This is a satisfying, pleasant movie. Just don't take it too seriously, and you'll have fun with it.<br /> Filmmakers like Burton have a unique opportunity through their medium to present imagery that is bizarre, over-the-top, surreal, dreamlike visuals. He sometimes goes further than necessary as in \\"Alice in Wonderland,\\" But this movie combines just enough fantasy with the everyday to make it a lighthearted  experience.
B0027BOL4G|4.0|Really informative and enjoyable.  Things that we all should know and be aware of.  This combined with a little research of your own should prove extremely important to the push you may need to make a lifestyle change.    Wasn't quite what I expected but certainly didn't disappoint.  Good movie that everyone needs to see at least one time.
0061914177|4.0|\\"Crush It!\\" is a good book.  Ironically, it solidified for me that my passion is staying home with and homeschooling my kids... neither of which pays a dime.  My husband works in ministry which doesn't pay well.  C'est la vie!  It's one thing to live a life of quiet desperation.  Quite another to live a life that makes your heart sing but doesn't pay monetarily. And Gary's philosophy still applies:  put in the time, give it all you've got, use any and all available tools to their fullest, and maintain an attitude of gratitude.  If you aren't passionate about what you are doing, if you aren't willing to give it your all, if you find yourself getting jaded, get out and do something else.  I agree.
B0015DROBO|4.0|This book is very good!  You have to get through some of the Swedish Government history, but it is great.  I love comparing books and movies.  I feel the Swedish versions of the movie were very accurate.  Love this series, I am sad that there will not be any more!
B002N5N5M0|4.0|America's favorite serial killer good guy returns for another season and faces off against his most powerful adversary--the Trinity Killer (John Lithgow). Dexter needs a role model for balancing family and murder. He thinks he might have found it once he I.D.'s the Trinity Killer who seems to have it all just exactly as Dexter (Michael C. Hall) does.<br /><br />Dexter suffers from exhaustion due his new baby and butts heads with Quinn. Special Agent Frank Lundey (Keith Carradine) returns now retired but he's trying to catch the one killer that got away--the Trinity Killer.<br /><br />I rented the DVD before buying the Blu-ray. The Blu-ray is worth the extra coin if you plan on watching the series again as the imagine quality, detail and colors are all superior. For most folks though the DVD will do just fine.<br /><br />The special features aren't exactly all that special. It's cross promotion time with episodes of \\"Californication\\", \\"The Tudors\\" and \\"Lock 'n Load\\" It seems that Showtime has been watching too many Universal TV show boxed sets.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the show the special features won't matter all that much but it would have been nice if Showtime had taken the time to include some on the DVDs.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the special features are only accessible via Blu-ray Live (or in the case of the DVD set on the internet) and include the second episode of the fourth season of \\"The Tudors\\" and interviews with the cast.<br /><br />This remains one of the finest seasons of the show. I just wish that Showtime would put more effort into their Blu-rays and DVD special features. I'd give this season 4 1/2 stars overall as it rarely missed the mark but give the Blu-ray 4 stars and the DVD 4 because of the lack of special features. I'm a special features geek so like that stuff when it's done well and here Showtime has dropped the ball fairly consistently with \\"Dexter\\".
0802136834|5.0|Amazing book. Never have I gone thru a 600 page book in a week! Alison Weir does a wonderful job in keeping historically accurate while still putting emotion and character into the story. You will love it.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This bag was exactly what I was looking for. I was looking for a well padded, comfortable bag with plenty of room. The bag has several large pockets, two convenient side pockets (that's where I keep my film so it's accessible), 2 large outer zipper pockets with mesh pockets inside (for filters or whatever).<br /><br />I can easily fit my two film SLR bodies (Minolta SRT-102 and XD-11), 2 flashes, 4 lenses (50mm, 24mm, 28mm, 70-210), several 55mm filters, a tripod, several rolls of film, and I still have room for 3 more lenses or another body (although those 4 are all I could ever need to take somewhere).<br /><br />The other big thing I like about this bag is unless you have a tripod strapped to it, it isn't obvious what's in it. Having a bag with a big Canon or Nikon logo (as others have said) is an invitation to steal it because the contents are definitely going to be a camera.<br /><br />I don't really know what else I can possibly say about this bag. It's big, it's cheap, it's well made, it holds lots of lenses and 3 bodies...
B0041CGP02|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this CD.I wish they used more songs from These Days and the first album. The newer songs don't WOW me but that's just my opinion. They're enough good tracks on here to make this collection worthwhile.
030746363X|4.0|Tim Ferris is crazy.  But that doesn't mean he doesn't have a lot of good things to teach you.  I really appreciate that there small changes you can make in your life that can have big results.  I can't wait to get started.
B003EY7IUY|2.0|I am a huge Shopaholic fan and devoured the other books in the series.  However, I noticed that the further I got into the series, the more difficult it was to try to get through each book.  This book was by far the most difficult to read, and I found myself having to stop reading on numerous occasions out of sheer frustration.      Becky's irresponsible and frivolous behavior was funny, charming and relatable in the first couple books.  However, as a loyal follower, you would expect her to at least learn *something* along the way.  Unfortunately, every single book shows Becky up to the same old tricks.  As other reviewers have said, it seems incredibly unrealistic that Becky would be able to pull the same capers over and over again and still have loyal and doting friends and family.  Her lies, trouble and drama are all maddeningly self-created, making it near-impossible to root for her.  And if you can't root for the main character, it does not make for a good or even fun read.  I really hope Kinsella either lays Becky's character to rest or finds some way to refresh her and give her a decent storyline that readers can get behind.
B0021L8V0M|5.0|Good entertainment, Great action, it moves right along. One flaw imo, was that there was no effort made to find Salt's husband...zip...nada...that just didn't make sense...it only took a moment to put that in...that's on the director.    The one CIA guy that does his darndest to kill her ....that was a bit poorly done and but the upside was it kept things just slightly off kilter which isn't a bad thing.    It was sort of predictable, but not so that you couldn't enjoy it. One stunt pushed the limit a little too far, but it was still entertaining. My wife said she felt like she wanted a nice action with some drama movie and she decided on Salt. We weren't disappointed and in this version, you definitely feel like it was left open for a sequel. Angelina Jolie made the character believeable. Her expressions in the closeups in tight moments was good. The fight choreography was really good, imo and she carried it off without a hitch. I hope there is a sequel.    For what you pay for a night's entertainment, 5 stars.  Not bad to watch again later on.
B00284BMBM|3.0|I always have to put a disclaimer in front of a review because there is always some joker out there who likes to argue taste which I find annoying. I Like this album, some of the songs are better than the first release. This album had fewer hit songs but the songs seem a little better polished this time around. If you like Nickelback you would probably like this album. The lead singer of Nickelback co-wrote one of the best songs on this disc, No Surprise. Check it out.
0060934913|5.0|This book was incredibly funny.  It must be said that, although Bourdain is definately NOT a writer, his down-to-earthness comes through with every word.  I found it hard to put down because of the way he organizes his ideas.  It is not just an autobiography, but a real snapshot of the life of what he says is marginal.  Anyone who has ever been in the restaurant business should read it, anyone thinking of becoming a chef should read it, and anyone who has ever had a bad experience at a restaurant.  I know I will definately think twice about some of the things I do in restaurants.  It's a great read!
B002KDUDG6|5.0|All of the songs in this CD are very well done, with some unusual adaptions that make the song truly Michaels.
B002ZG981E|5.0|Great and original. Super exciting and believable. If you cant follow this movie, you might need to go back to school! j/k its great though.
B0036OS3Q0|5.0|I got one size larger than my normal so I can slip in my comfort insoles.  These boots are light weight, durable, waterproof and easy to slip on and off.  The traction on the bottom is really good stuff too.
B002RI9ZQ8|4.0|All my friends had already read this book before I started, and raved about it. As a result, I was nervous about picking it up, in case it didn't meet my expectations. I needn't have feared.<br /><br />I love murder mysteries, but most are completely predictable and have a sense of 'been there, done that, bought the coffee mug'. While a minority of plot lines in this book were predictable, the majority catch you unawares, and leave you breathless at their ingenuity.<br /><br />The pace in the beginning feels on the ponderous side - probably because of having to get used to the unfamiliar spellings of the Swedish names (some of which are fairly similar) - but by the end it's racing. As I reached the last third of the book I knew that I would have to stay up late to finish reading, because I simply could not put it down.<br /><br />The unusual setting (i.e. not in the USA or UK or Europe) adds a certain 'je ne sais quoi' to the novel - the pleasant flavour of which remains with you long after you've read the last page.<br /><br />Often, in a translation, something of the brilliance of the original language is lost as idioms or a turn of phrase particular to the language cannot be wholly translated, or else what is produced often feels heavy and slightly disjointed. Not being able to read Swedish, I can't comment on how faithful the translation is to the original. However, this novel flows beautifully.<br /><br />At the conclusion of the novel, while justice is served to the perpetrators (in some measure), there's no Hollywood ending. Instead, just as it feels like everything is resolved to the reader's satisfaction, something goes horribly awry. Of course, it's all a ploy to get you to read the next book in the trilogy. Even being aware of that trick, it took me all of 2 days after finishing this book to buy the next one and start reading. I simply HAD to know what happened next. You'll be just as hooked, I'm sure.
B000WAEJZ0|5.0|All whitney's fans should get this album! Years later, we still enjoy those songs...This CD is a pure treasure!!!! go and buy this CD ;you won't be disappointed
B000021XS0|5.0|Previously I'd heard a couple of Dream Theater tracks from various albums, so recently I purchased a few CD's locally - but only limited albums were available.    I always liked the \\"Fatal Tragedy\\" track, so after a quick search, I located & bought this album on Amazon (worked out way cheaper too!)    Man !  Am I happy with it !?!  -  Absolutely !  Can't stand the opening song \\"Regression\\", [although it does set up the premise for the album], but who cares - The rest is awesome !    Being an old muso, I always look for quality of writing, production, & musicianship, rather than just boring repetitive 'Head-Banger' material.   We all know that just being \\"Top musicians\\", doesn't always equate to great music.  No need to worry about that with this offering...    This album has Great melody/musicality throughout, Soloing is excellent on almost every track, and your interest is carried along through the theme of the whole album (The killing of Victoria).  Good balance of light/shade/dark.  It has re-kindled my interest in the slightly heavier side of the rock/metal genre.  Good twist at the end too.  This one, I Definitely have to recommend...    Now I will start looking for more of their other albums for my next purchase...
B0026OE2NY|5.0|I have seen many beautiful documentaries by BBC and IMAX with superb cinematography but none comes close to this one for showing this beautiful blue planet with an aerial voyage. So many locations, so many spots in different countries that you can not see or visit unless you are in the air. With such beautiful colors you will be glued to your set for 120 minutes. Absolutely unbelievable how he got that many breathtaking aerial shots at the right time of the day and the year from all over the world... shocking. Chronos [[ASIN:B0001Z48WU Chronos (Special Collector's Edition)]] was one of the first IMAX movies. It takes you to different places in world which is very stunning and educational.  The same concept is behind BARAKA [[ASIN:B001CDLATE Baraka [Blu-ray]]] with the same people but Baraka shows more of the culture and individuals than Chronos. First version was released in 1985 and now they have updated to Blue Ray DVD in 2007. Regardless, these are very entertaining and in order to see the film you need to watch it few times or use pause and rewind since these are extraordinary shots of extraordinary places and environments and there are so many colors and details that is a feast to the eye. Infact at the end of the films you can read in credits for the locations of their shooting and do more research and even visit those places if you happen to be a lucky individual. To be truly shocked, to see so many unbelievable places, HOME [[ASIN:B0026OE2O8 Home [Blu-ray]]] tops it all. All of these are masterfully done. If you have any appreciation for places, beauty, culture, religion, art, nature, details, color and more importantly god's creations you certainly will not be disappointed. Double Bravo.
B002W1HBN4|5.0|This is rare material! seeing and hearing whitney at her beginnings shows us the incredible talent of this woman! Interviews, videoclips, rare performances and great music(remixes included) make this CD a \\"must have\\" for all music livers. Thumbs up, miss Whitney and thanks to Clive Davis to bring this treasure to the world of music.....
B000001FTD|5.0|This has been my favorite Anthrax CD since it was first released. Well, back then I had it on cassette. Every song on \\"Among the Living\\" kicks booty!
0446615641|5.0|David Baldacci is my all-time favorite author and the Stone Cold series was my favorite of his books.  There are plenty of reviews on this book already so I won't waste a lot of time.  All I will say is that the books keep my interest (and then some!) and they're very well written.  He doesn't bore you with long, useless descriptions of things.  I have read just about every book of his and I've liked them all.
0307272702|5.0|Wow - what a revolutionary book. Like a previous reviewer, I too found myself angry at times while reading this book -- angry that the medical/science community up 'til now was so quick to label overweight people as gluttonous sloths that just need to have some self restraint and get off our butts. But mostly I was relieved that there is hope now. However, like Mr. Taubes says, our society has such a tough time escaping the paradigms. I have tried so many supposedly \\"healthy eating,\\" calorically reduced diets following the FDA's food pyramid. I did sometimes lose weight, but was always hungry, always thinking about the next meal. And now, just past my 50th b-day, I'm heavier than I've ever been - and eating supposedly \\"healthier\\" than I ever have! I am researching and planning my new low-carb lifestyle. But I'm also preparing myself for the naysayers - all those well-intentioned people that are just eating the way the \\"experts\\" have told them we should eat. I'm getting ready for the, \\"you're falling for one of those fad diets? Just eat less, eat low fat, exercise...\\" comments. Now how to we get Mr. Taube's research to be taken seriously by our doctors and get some seriously considered research out there that is not afraid to defy the status quo, like Mr. Taubes has?
B0043GXYBO|3.0|So, I'm a huge fan of vampires. Certainly one of my favorite topics of urban fantasy, especially when seen from the all-too-rare female side of things. I like some nice fluffy YA now and again, and while I wasn't expecting anything mind blowing from this, I wasn't exactly expecting what I got, either.    First off, the good. The vampire lore is mostly intriguing, especially with their ties to the goddess Nyx, something that gives them a little more background than being just your average bloodsucker. The book also has a fantastic sense of atmosphere, with the school's gothic gaslight style described admirably, and the unique facial markings are a nice, appealing touch.    There is a lot to be annoyed about, though. Alternate spelling of vampire aside for absolutely no real reason at all, the main issue with the book is sadly the main character. Given that this book is co-written by Cast's daughter, I can't help feeling like a lot of the parentheticals Zoey adds to statements in order to provide her own views on certain things are instead the views of Kristin Cast herself.    Things like an overly stereotypical view of girls hating video games (\\"Um, ew\\", as Zoey herself says...or should I say Kristin?), constant belittling of dark clothing, and an overly common tendency to name the brand of every item of clothing (and even bedspread) she possesses makes Zoey nothing more than a rather irritating, frustrating, and downright annoying stereotype that only perpetuates the vision of vapid, shallow high school girls interested in nothing more than boys and clothes.    Cast's obvious view on female sexuality is also made all too clear, with random, unasked for proselytizing on the idea of oral sex being \\"degrading\\" to any girl who would dare perform such an act, for her own enjoyment or otherwise.     All in all, it's hard to say whether or not to recommend the book. The lore and setting are certainly interesting, but Zoey being a blatant, poorly disguised mouthpiece for Kristin Cast's all too stereotypical and conservative viewpoints makes it difficult to cheer for her at all. One could make the argument that Zoey's ideas are ingrained in her from her overly religious parents, members of an obvious fundamental Christian analog, but whether or not this changes throughout the series will remain to be seen. Whether or not one wants to risk being stuck with Zoey's cliche of a character is up to the reader.
B001FB4W16|5.0|This show is great, not that dimond-sparky-flesh-blood-suckers.  This is cool, not only for the MA rating but the quality of the show itself.
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|This is an inspiring story.  It shows that two different characters with different backgrounds can come together and become good, if not, best friends in the end.
0553381695|5.0|Many editorial reviews of book (or movie) sequels claim that the second is as good as, or better than, the original. I read the same thing about \\"A Clash of Kings\\", George R.R. Martin's sequel to \\"A Game of Thrones\\". I was a bit skeptical, I mean...how can one not question whether Martin could duplicate what he accomplished in the first novel, let alone better it. \\"Thrones\\" is magnificently expansive and epic...how could book 2 match the energy and intensity?    Martin absolutely knocked the ball out of the park with \\"Clash\\". I don't know if it's better than \\"Thrones\\", but it's easily its equal. He takes the core set of surviving characters (Arya, Sansa, Bran, Catelyn, Jon, Cersei and the wonderfully rich Tyrion), and picks up almost immediately where \\"Thrones\\" left off. And I don't just mean in terms of plot, but also in building out his fantastic world of intrigue, adventure and politics.     \\"Clash\\" is complicated, intense and absolutely epic. It sprawls majestically over a widely varied physical and literary landscape. The politics within the plot, focused on four Kings battling over a land that's used to having only one, are intricate, but not difficult to follow. Martin's writing is clear, his dialogue is smooth and the interplay between characters is enjoyable and completely in sync with the overall tone and 'place' of the story. The book is very serious and heavy - at about 1,000 pages, the book is actually heavy, but I love the weightiness, with corresponding depth, of the story.    Like \\"Thrones\\", there's not a ton of fantasy in \\"Clash\\". It's very middle-ages-historical-fiction with a tinge of supernatural. There's more fantasy in this book than in the first, though, and it feels like it'll build into much more for the third book. There are dragons, but they set up a certain tone and act more as a plot device than anything else. There's no fire-breathing and attacking and destroying. There's further development around Bran's supernatural connection with his direwolf Summer, and we see that the bastard Stark, Jon, has a bit of the gift as well. There are a few more fantastical devices scattered throughout the book, which Martin develops slowly through his world's mythology rather than hammering in a slew of de facto dungeons & dragons.    The characters are Martin's true accomplishment. He feeds off a character's strengths and deficiencies, and each one is perfectly human and in some way relate-able. Individuals-as-'outsiders', is the base upon which the best characters are built. And he uses that foundation frequently. Tyrion, the dwarf prince, has become one of my favorite and most memorable characters in the series, and perhaps one of the most well-developed characters in any popular fiction. He's witty and smart, and sometimes obnoxiously flip. But his deep-seated insecurities which evolve slowly over the course of both of the first books make his chapters the most anticipated. Arya develops into a wonderfully three dimensional character as the tomboy princess cut off from her family, trying to survive and find a way back home. Sansa's princess-ly arrogance dissipates under the strain of trying to survive as a hostage, and finds friends in very un-princess-ly places.     There's no reason to read this book before the first. There's a wealth of back story upon which \\"Clash\\" is built. Some of which Martin explains, most of which he doesn't, which I found enjoyably and surprisingly subtle. I would've been more lost if I'd not read the books back-to-back. And yes, they're that good that I was willing to invest over a month of precious reading time in two 1,000-page books.    I'm looking forward to seeing HBO's creation of Martin's world of Ice and Fire coming this spring. Until then, I'll start digging into book 3 - \\"A Storm of Swords\\". I expect that the overwhelming wealth of positive reviews mean there's more of Martin's great stuff ahead.
0920668372|1.0|1) why do we never see the mother with the child during the day? why is he alone exhibiting awful behavior? why should i ever put the idea into my baby's head that putting my watch down the toilet might be cute or funny, or that being a rude teenager who won't clean up after himself is okay? there are plenty of books that say how much and truly you love your children, and show parents and children together doing positive activities.<br /><br />2) why is she creeping across the floor? why is she driving across town at night with a ladder and climbing into his window? why can she not say she loves him except for when he's asleep? i find all this disturbing.<br /><br />3) you have to come visit me because i'm going to die.  apparently, he never comes to visit, and now only will because she is sick and going to die. maybe if she told him she loved him when he was awake and played with him more he would've come to visit sooner. i don't want my children being reminded that one day i'll die, especially not at bedtime.<br /><br />4) so mom has a creepy relationship with son, no papa around, no wife in that single bed of sonny's that his mother climbs into at night. mom dies, now he magically has a daughter, whom he will apparently treat the same way. what is going on here?<br /><br />5) the artwork isn't even very good.<br /><br />there are so many lovely children's books in the world, i have no idea how this has stayed in print other than people thinking from the title it'd be a good gift.<br /><br />one beautiful book is [[ASIN:0312549660 Wherever You Are: My Love Will Find You]] the words and illustrations and the sentiment are right on. i want my son to know that as he grows up and goes on adventures my love is with him everywhere, no matter what.<br /><br />a more playful one is [[ASIN:0439634695 I Love You Stinky Face]] in which a mom assures her son that she loves him no matter what, even if he became a smelly skunk, a terrible dinosaur, or a big ape.<br /><br />i am a lover of books and have been since i was little and i just can't believe how awful i love you forever is.t can't believe how awful i love you forever is.
B002KSPKRS|1.0|If they don't hiss or make THE most irratating screamming popping sound now, they will soon and it won't stop. It gets so bad that I used to keep the volume at low, but what's the point when you can't hear anything for the sake of not having that stupid crackling and popping sound scream into your ear. The x41's are WAY overpriced and seem, build wise, more like $60. At $160-200 you can just forget it! Do yourself and your wallet a favor and don't buy this absolute piece of garbage. Even without the the hissing, crackling and popping noises, the x41 is mediocre at best. I do admit however the nice convenience of it being wireless but that's it. Period.

Just when you think you know where the story is going, something totally unexpected happens. I had been looking forward to the day this book would come out since I finished the previous one, and it was well worth the wait. I cant wait to see what other books Moning has in store, and look forward to reading those as well.

0060936223|4.0|Patti Smith, a rock-n-roll poet who moved to New York City in the late 1960s and rose to fame in the 1970s, was privy to a fascinating period in the city's cultural growth.  On some occasions, William Burroughs staggered out of a bar near the Chelsea Hotel, where Smith lived for a while; as Smith tells it, whenever she saw him in this state she helped him into a cab.  Alan Ginsberg tried to pick her up, until he realized she was a young woman rather than a young boy.  (He bought her lunch anyway, and they remained friends.)  Andy Warhol's influence was palpable but on the wane, and his cohorts abounded, many on the brink of self destruction but full of life for the moment.  And in now legendary clubs such as Maxwell's and CBGB's, bands like Television and Velvet Underground ushered in a new musical era.  Smith, who ultimately collaborated with some of these individuals, describes them all with a profoundly generous spirit.  She finds the quirkiness, and the beauty, in even the most misguided souls.    In addition, Smith tells a non traditional love story: her relationship with the late photographer Robert Mapplethorpe.  When they met, they were barely into their twenties (the \\"kids\\" in the book's title), determined to make it as Artists but still struggling to figure out just what that meant.  They became lovers at once and remained together for a while even after Mapplethorpe embraced his identity as a homosexual.  She expresses an abiding gratitude that they found each other early on.  They \\"got\\" each other as artists from the start, providing critical support during those formative years.  As their deep friendship went through its twists and turns, they also began to discover their voices as artists.  The book describes this journey of discovery and offers a fascinating glimpse into their creative processes.    Smith is a romantic who counts Rimbaud and Jim Morrison among her heroes, and at times her prose is a touch \\"purple\\" for my taste.  More importantly, though, she writes throughout with sincerity, grace and humor.  As for rating this book -- I find the five-star system a bit constraining.  I'd give it over a 4 but under a 4 ½ star review because it's lovely and touching but not transformative.  Therefore I will give it a 4.
1594488843|4.0|In Drive Daniel H Pink, a former political aide-turned author and lecturer, overturns the conventional notions that operate modern companies' dealings with its people and debunks what we think are true regarding motivation and people management.<br /><br />Much like a Malcolm Gladwell, who translates academia and science into layman's terms for wider dissemination, Pink digests behavioural and management science from the last 50 years into a surprisingly effective essay regarding how to motivate human beings, which conventional and accepted ideas are gibberish and which actions are counter-effective. The book is interesting in its audacity and perhaps startling in both its conclusions and how so much that is so tested and known in some circles has not seeped into mainstream business. I say 'perhaps' because much of the contents is actually coherent and often what many of us have experienced and subconsciously identified, but never put quite found in one tome and in this way. Many managers, business owners or human resource professionals should prepare for a jolt judging by how seldom these ideas are practiced and, indeed, how often they are resisted. Apparently, much of the business world is still in the Dark Ages.<br /><br />Speaking of which, Pink begins with definitions of Motivation 1.0 (early/basic man who seeks survival), moves to Motivation 2.0 (the carrot and stick model for reward and punishment) and his central theme of Motivation 3.0, which address intrinsic motivators for creative and non-routine work. Imagine how a reward could be a negative. Pink does! And when one thinks about the impossibility of that notion Pink pulls the example of volunteer-run success of Wikipedia versus the paid staffers of the deceased Encarta, which was previously a product of Microsoft. Perhaps Motivation 2.0 is increasingly irrelevant in the Western world. While routine and programmatic work can be outsourced, heuristic and non-routine work generally cannot. Since job growth in our circles is mostly from the latter carrots and sticks are a dangerously anachronistic paradigm that need to be severely reconsidered. As well as Pink explains the concept well; imagine the ways we have to go when imagining telling a sales manager to forego assigning a bonus/commission-based model to his or her salespeople. Unlikely, right? Pink seriously challenges that type of thinking. Adding rewards to pleasurable non-programmatic work has the opposite effect and indeed make the job unpleasant. Taking the extrinsic reward away renders the job pleasant in itself and gives it a sense of purpose and achievement. Pink will explain that financial incentives will make performance worse. Rewards, science shows, narrow the focus when the work calls for thinking and creativity and excitement. To be clear, he hesitates to render the same judgement for algorithmic work.<br />Having said that, Pink clearly elaborates and explains that 'baseline rewards' need to be sufficient for this model to work.<br /><br />In the second part of Drive, Pink explains the three elements of true motivation. These are Autonomy, Mastery and Purpose. He then offers examples, actual case studies and techniques for unleashing these elements. Most managers and leaders prefer and seek Intrinsically motivated people (he calls them Type I) to Extrinsically motivated (type X) individuals. What if there was a template for unleashing the latter and harnessing the ensuing talent and energy? To be clear, Pink insists on fairness and equity being a prerequisite, but not as a form of carrots and stick rule. Going back to the three elements, Drive addresses the dominance of purpose over profit, specific goals over constant reward systems and giving people control over their work environments (including team-mates, work hours and tasks) as essential to motivation and success. Imagine it. Pink and many businesses did and the case studies are enlightening. The examples are there, but whether, as the bookjacket proclaims Drive is \\"paradigm-shattering\\" depends on the dissemination and acceptance of the idea at the top echelon of the business and workforce entities. After all, Daniel Pink is telling sales managers, just to cite one example, to stop the commission-based system and to instead discover that the new hires have longer-term visions of their work. The news is that the message is hard to dismiss.<br /><br />The book is padded with chapter summaries, conversation starters, an index and even a helpful glossary. This makes it a useful handbook on top of its exciting content. Having read it three times over the last several months, useful and exciting are certainly appropriate words here.<br /><br />Challenging conventional wisdom could be termed Drive's first and last word were it not for its drawing from actual academic studies and learnings.paradigm-shattering\\" depends on the dissemination and acceptance of the idea at the top echelon of the business and workforce entities.

044654759X|3.0|I am a Nicholas Sparks fan so he automatically gets 3 stars in my book.  While his books never truly disappoint, Safe Haven was way too similar to the Julia Robert's movie Sleeping with the Enemy (and frankly not as good).  It is about a woman who flees to a small town to get away from her abusive husband and she meets a man who could perhaps save her from her horrible past.  Although I enjoyed the book, I was a little disappointed in Nicholas Sparks since I wait all year long for him to come out with a good book and this was just okay.  If you are looking for a five star Nicholas Sparks book try [[ASIN:0446696137 A Bend in the Road]], [[ASIN:0446605239 The Notebook]] (obviously) or [[ASIN:0446696110 The Guardian]] as these books are written by Sparks at his best.

0783230079|5.0|I've been looking for this movie for ten years because I watched it once in my youth and got hooked. I was just about to order it from Amazon, but I found it just recently in a thrift store and bought it for two dollars.<br /><br />This movie is excellent! 4 ghosts that remain attached to one kid who was born around the same time they died. When the kid begins to be classified as \\"strange\\" because he's conversing with ghosts that no one else can see or hear, the ghosts decide to leave him alone for the next 25-some-odd years. In the present day, they make themselves known to the kid, who is now grown up and having forgot all about his friends, and also find out they have to repossess his body in order for them to achieve their unfinished business and catch the next \\"bus\\" to the eternities. What I thought hilarious was the scene where the singer with stage fright booms out his rendition of the Star Spangled Banner in front of a live audience, which was very impressive and quite catchy.<br /><br />This movie would be an impressive addition to any movie collection and can be watched for many times to come. Anyone who says different has no business making movie reviews at all.

B001GZ6QEC|5.0|The Dark Knight Movie Review   In all movies there is something that hits right at home for everyone who watches. The director can make you think, make you laugh, cry or even make you leave the movie in all out confusion. That is how I was when I first saw The Dark Knight, confused. After I watched this movie a few more times I started to realize a few outlooks on Christianity through the director's point of the movie. Like Jesus and Satan fighting over someone's soul or a figure who is like a \\"Jesus\\" to Gotham city, another outlook I could see is a figure in the movie playing the role as Satan. Everyone can be tempted by the devil but it takes the followers of Christ to try to not fall to the temptation from Satan.    There is now and always will be an ongoing battle between Jesus and Satan to win your heart. Everyone has been tempted by Satan somewhere down the road. With being tempted by Satan he is trying to win you over to his side. The one thing Satan hates more than anything is when Christians chooses God's side. In this film Harvey Dent is Gotham cities attorney. The Joker in this movie picked him out because he thought that he would be the one to fall. It says in the Bible in Matthew 26:41 to \\"keep watching and praying that you may not enter into temptation; the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.\\" I believe that this verse is every way what happened to Harvey in this film. He was on top of everything in Gotham city, until he was tempted by \\"Satan\\" in the movie. Harvey held up for as long as he could against Satan, until he had all that he could take. When he finally broke down and went to the dark side he was there for good. That is what can't happen to us as Christians we absolutely cannot fall to the Satan. Satan hates it when he sees us doing God's will that kills him inside. We need to be the ones that make's Satan kill on the inside. The ones who love God so much that we would die for him. God has to be the rock that we establish our ground tofight off Satan.   All of this brings me to my next point which is that batman was the \\"Jesus\\" of Gotham city.  As Jesus protects us, so does batman. Although batman does not heal a leper, or make blind men see, he protects Gotham city like Jesus protected us. To Christians Jesus is everything to us, batman is Gotham's everything. He is the one we go to when everything goes wrong. He is the one we praise when there is time of praise. I believe that Gotham city saw batman as that figure that would protect them through everything that went wrong in the city. Just like every other city in the world the people who live there knows who batman is. Much like everyone in Galilee knew who Jesus was. Although in Gotham the ones that lived in the city did not see batman everyone knew who he was. Batman is the protector of the city just as Jesus is the protector of the flock. The Bible say's in 1st Peter 2:25 (For you were like sheep going astray, but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls). I feel as if batman came to be the protector of the city because he knew that the city was like that stray sheep. That needed guidance in their darkest hour, much like all of the non-believers in this world. We need Jesus like the city of Gotham needed the protection of batman. Without him that whole city would crumble, much like Christians without Jesus.   In every movie there has to be a bad guy. In most cases in movies the bad guy is a mentally disable to understand what is right and what is wrong. I see that aspect in the joker, he thinks that his attacks that he is doing are right. Through all of his attacks in the movie I see Satan written all over his face. Throughout the whole movie he is tempting Harvey Dent. He is tempting him by killing his fiancé. The joker tempted Harvey all the way until he finally breaks down and turns to the other side. The side filled of villains, killers, robbers and, rapist, just every type of person imaginable that would be your typical bad guy. That would be the side that Satan is on, he just wants you be just as evil as he is. I personally don't think that Satan will stop until the day we all leave this earth. All of this is just a simple example of the power that Satan has on a \\"strong\\" person. If you don't guard your heart from him you will fall to him.   To wrap this whole thing up, you as an audience has read my opinion on The Dark Knight. From how I can see that Harvey Dent's soul is being fought over by the \\"good\\" side or batman and the bad side also known as the joker. With that I can see how Jesus and Satan fight over average peoples souls in the world today, batman being Jesus and the joker being Satan. This goes into my other points of batman being a Jesus figure to all of the city of Gotham. You see that with his actions of being the protector of all of Gotham city. This brings me to my last point of the joker portraying the modern day Satan, by corrupting the city and pretty much turning it upside down with his evil ways. Throughout this review you have seen a little bit deeper into The Dark Knight from a Christian world view.
0385341679|5.0|I don't know what book the people who say Shadowfever is boring are reading but it's certainly not the same book I read. I have to agree with the vast majority, this book is a roller coaster ride but it's not full of gratuitous whiplash. Once things come to light you're like, OMG, brilliant! or OMG, I can't believe I didn't see that! or OMG, of course!  Everything that happens follows perfectly if you've been paying attention.  Never once did I think boring, I was too busy, crying, laughing, jumping up and down in joy.      KMM writes a story and characters that are so vivid that it doesn't feel like I'm reading the story so much as I'm living the story. I relished every word in this book except two, THE END. I never want this story to end. I love the characters and I hope that KMM continues to write their story for years to come because I'm just not ready to say goodbye.         I hate to put this on KMM but she has written a book that has pretty much ruined me for any other book. I have been anxiously awaiting this book since I finished Dreamfever last year. If you're worried that Shadowfever won't live up to your expectations, worry no more! This book exceeded every expectation I had of it! I just can't imagine how it could have been more perfect.       What I love about this story and the series overall is you can read the Fever series on a surface level and enjoy it for what it is, a fabulously written tale or you can delve into the many various layers woven into the story and get to enjoy the many threads that are woven throughout the book to create this beautifully written, intricate story.

143350393X|1.0|I refused to believe other reviews that claimed there were mistakes in the printing. However, I did check each page to verify and they were right. There are several sections in Leviticus,1 and 2 Kings, Luke, Galatians, etc. That the difference between pages is evident. It seems like one page is printed normal and the very next one is printed in bold letters. You can see the difference in printing color immediately. It is still readable but annoying because that much ink in visible from the backside of the page. The paper is thinner than usual, and even though Crossway used the thinnest paper they could find, this Bible is still very thick and heavy. I understand the size ad weight because it is packed with information. So do not expect to be able to carry this Bible to Church each Sunday. This is a stay home Bible.  I have no complaints about the content, it is one of the best. But the quality control is unacceptable.I paid $47+ for this Bible and I expect it to be flawless. And since I was not satisfied with the quality I sent it back. Hopefully, Crossway would make some changes in their quality control department and then I will buy this Bible again.
0061537934|4.0|Enzo is a highly evolved dog who dearly loves his owner Denny. On the eve of his death, Enzo recalls his life with Denny which started when Denny was single. Enzo saw Denny through getting married, the birth of his daughter Zoe and great tragedy and adversity throughout their time together.<br /><br />The Art of Racing In the Rain was my book club, Conversati-om's, January pick. I was a bit apprehensive about it because 1)I am ambivalent toward dogs 2)I do not like car racing. I think it's a true testament to the power of this book's story that I loved it anyway. The racing parts were brief and mostly used as metaphors so I was not bothered by them. And I kept forgetting Enzo was a dog, he was so insightful as a narrator. On the brief occasions that he did do something dog-like, it caught me off guard. I thought the author did a great job of explaining the rational behind Enzo's actions when he did do something that I wouldn't think a highly evolved dog would do - like tearing up Zoe's stuffed animals.<br /><br />I was totally caught up in Denny's journey throughout this book. I don't want to give to much away but my stomach was in knots for him at times. This the first book by Garth Stein that I've read - I'm looking forward to reading more.

B00394A4UK|5.0|Lehane's narrative momentum throughout this novel is gripping and nearly impossible to put down once you start reading it, the poignant descriptions, the flowing, realistic dialogue, the continuous mood that makes you feel that \\"something is just not right\\" keeps you turning pages.  What the author is most skillful at is interweaving dream scenes into the plot without resorting to superficial devices like using italics or parentheses.  The shift between actual events and probable events, or imaginations, are seamless.  The way Lehane collapses the past, present and, sometimes even the future, into crisp, encapsulated moments of narrative passage is nothing short of masterful.  Having seen the movie version of the novel first, I was not in the least bit disappointed in reading the book afterwards.  The screenplay writers did an excellent job of maintaing the integrity and artistic merit of the work.

B00005RDRO|5.0|I used to watch this movie as a kid.  Decided to buy it as an adult.  Very silly and funny.  Worth the purchase.
B004BLJQOK|2.0|Hackneyed vampire story with a script and directing that was predictable, disjointed and lacking in creative storytelling that, sadly,  was potentially possible in this unique juxtaposition of two misunderstood needy lovers. Opportunity missed! Instead we just get shallow personifications of characters such as parents, guardians, caretakers, professionals and teachers that are presented as incompetent expendable meals that have no more depth than a shadow. These people were given such small stereotypic roles that we seem to care little whether they die or do nothing all film long. Just not real! The rest of the unreality of this film was the heavy reliance upon ripping people apart which, again, did nothing to advance our understanding of our misunderstood protagonists.     Two stars for the cinematography and Chloë's presence. Although, wasted in a movie where her talents were diminished by very fakey blood; CGI teeth; bare feet endlessly filmed (another reason why Americans need to wear sandals more often) and posing for the camera with \\"the look\\" punctuated by limited scripted lines that seemed almost tritely comical. She needs a new agent.     You would think that a nearly 1000 year old 12 year old vampire would have experienced love at least once in that long life span. Also, you would think that raiding blood banks and hospital blood freezers would be a whole lot quicker and safer source of hemoglobin (you know - AIDS; other viruses and pathogens would be screened out). Also, what does a Rubik's cube have to do with innately primitive blood hunting savagery - there's  just not a whole lot of abstract creative intelligence transfer between the two activities.     Conclusion: Just a poorly thought out and directed script.
0061122416|5.0|Whereas I understand why some people might have a problem with the author's straightforward writing style in The Alchemist, I think that very simplicity serves the book's messages well. I am confused however that anyone would mistake the book for a superficial read. If The Alchemist doesn't get you thinking about your own life, dreams, relationships, and choices then I'm not really certain what will. One of my favorite books of all time, and one I re-read when it seems like I'm just going through the motions of life.
B000OTM1PO|5.0|Is there a christian view in the film Superman Returns?  What can be seen as similarities of Christ in superman are; neither are of this world, the care and love of humanity, and both are seen as saviors to many.   The main character Superman could be seen as a Christ type character.  Not saying that Christ is  going to fly around the world wearing blue tights and a red cape.  He also isn't going to use heat vision to blow things or use super breath to freeze things.  Neither would Christ use x-ray vision to look through things.  But what can be seen as similarities of Christ in superman are; the care and love of humanity, neither are of this world, and both are seen as saviors to many.  From the beginning to the end of the movie you can see the compassion that superman has towards humanity.  Just as the society in biblical days was looking for a signs of the coming savior in before Jesus was born \\"But Ahaz said, \\"I will not ask;  I will not put the Lord to the test.\\"  The Isaiah said,  \\"Hear now, you house of David!  Is it not enough to try the patience of men?  Will you try the patience of my God also?  Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign:  The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel.  He will eat curds and honey when he know enough to reject the wrong and choose the right, the land of the two kings you dread will be laid waste.  The Lord will bring on you and on your people and on the house of your father a time unlike any since Ephraim broke away from Judah he will bring the king of Assyria.\\"(Isaiah 7:12-17) so was the society of the movie.       After he return back from space and was at his home in Smalleville, he watched the world news and saw the problems that that the world as a whole is having.  With the first action scene in the movie he seem com-paled to save the people on board the out of control plane.  Even though his love of Lois Lane might have played a big part of him saving the plane there still was compassion for saving not just the people on the plane but in the stadium full of people where the plane was going to crash.   Further in the movie he is seen flying up into the upper atmosphere to listen to problems of the world were having.  He is then seen going to from place to place to help people from big to small problems.  Just as Christ during his time on earth and still is helping people.  \\"When the sun was setting, the people brought to Jesus all who had various kinds of sickness, and laying his hands on each one, healed them.  At daybreak Jesus went out to a solitary place.  The people were looking for him and when they came to where he was, they tried to keep him from leaving them.\\"(Luke 4:40 and 42)  In another scene from the movie where superman shows his compassion towards society, is when he has to make a decision between saving Lois Lane and the city of Metropolis.  In this scene superman puts personal feelings aside and focuses on saving the city from disaster.     Even after saving the city and Lois Lane from danger, superman put himself in a position where he was vulnerable to be attacked.  Lex Luther his arch nemesis used superman's only weakness against him.  That weakness as everyone knows is kryptonite.  Even after being stab with a blade made of kryptonite and with the help from Lois Lane who removed most of it from his side, he still was able to regain strength from the energy from the sun.  This scene reminded me how Jesus overcame Satan not only in the wilderness \\"After fasting forty days and forty nights, he was hungry. The tempter came to him and said , \\"If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread\\"  Jesus answered, It is written 'Man does not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.  Then the devil took him to the holy city and had him stand on the highest point of the temple.  If you are the Son of God he said throw yourself down.  For it is written:  \\"He will command his angelsconcerning you, and they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.  Jesus answered him, \\"It is also written:  Do not put the Lord your God to the test.  Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor.  \\"All this I will bow down and worship me.\\"  Jesus said to him, \\"Away from me, Satan!  For it is written:  Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only.\\"  Then the devil left him, and angels came and attended him.\\"(Matthew 4:2-11).  When superman cut through the island made of kryptonite and carried it into space, it kind of reminded me of how Jesus carried the sins of the world onto the cross.  Just as Christ did not have to do what he did for by sacrificing himself for us on the cross, superman did not have to do what he did for the people of Metropolis.  He could have said I am going to make sure I that I am okay, forget about everyone else.  But he didn't he put self aside and dealt with the crisis at hand.  There is a moment in the movie where superman flies Lois Lane up above the city of Metropolis, and explains to her that even though she said the world didn't need a savior, he hears the cries for one.     As Christian I tend to look for the Godly aspects in films. I for one did enjoy the film, even though it was quite long.  I love the fact that it stress the love and compassion of superman.  Just as Christ showed through out his ministry.

B000BP86OG|4.0|The Darkness are what rock 'n roll needed and still does. A singer who has enthusiasm, great guitar riffs, and a solid back beat. This band plays and it's FUN!! \\"Permission to Land\\" was basically a demo according to Justin Hawkins. This album is what \\"Permission...\\" would have been if the band would have had more time and money.        The album kicks off with a great anti-drug song, \\"One Way Ticket to Hell and Back\\". I heard this track and I knew the band weren't going to let me down with this second effort. It's ironic that Justin Hawkins writes a song about cocaine abuse when he's in the midst of a serious habit himself. It was this habit that led to him wanting to leave the band...pity.        \\"Knockers\\" is a dirty song about a fling with a heavy-set girl. The chorus is hilarious. \\"Hazel Eyes\\" and \\"Blind Man\\" are excellent tunes as well. Roy Thomas Baker's production on this album harkens back to those classic Queen albums he worked on way back when rock bands wanted to achieve a sound and a feel for their albums.          The band's playing throughout the album is excellent. Ed Graham's drumming probably doesn't get enough credit. The secret ingredient to any good rock song is a competent rhythm section. I can't fail to mention the fabulous guitar work of the Hawkins brothers. Dan lays down concrete rhythm and string-bending leads, and Justin drives it all home with his over-the-top tapping and quick licks.           Overall both this album and \\"Permission to Land\\" are great rock and roll albums. This band took flack for Justin's singing and their \\"copycat\\" sound. I've got news for you: Every rock band has either lifted and /or stolen beats and riffs from some other artist. Don't believe me? Listen to Howlin' Wolf's \\"Killing Floor\\" and then to \\"The Lemon Song\\" off of \\"Led Zeppelin 2\\". If it's good it will be copied. The Darkness show their influences, that's for sure, but they never claimed to be totally original, either. If you want rock in an era of dog-bark singing and riff-bashing, check out this album
B003BVK2ZS|3.0|I saw this book ages ago when I was scanning the new release table at my local bookstore, but did not actually purchase it until I found myself stranded at an airport in bad weather.  I found \\"The Man Who Loved Books Too Much\\" and thought it would capture my attention.  Allison Bartlett dives into the rare book industry and retells the true story of John Gilkey, a remarkably successful rare book thief.  I admit that I have never felt the pull of rare books and would rather fill my shelves with as many volumes as possible than just a few that would increase my homeowner's insurance.  However, Barlett gives us an introduction to the rare book market, its sellers and its patrons, from the perspective of a wide-eyed admirer.  For me, this was the greatest success of this book and I found the stories, some of the most notorious historical players, and statistics fascinating.  Throughout the years, many have felt the pull of rare books, though collectors have very different reasons for desiring them.<br /><br />John Gilkey loves rare books because of the image they inspire - wealth, intelligence, the finer things.  The problem is that he does not have the means to obtain the books he so obsessively desires.  In this book, Barlett sets up his primary adversary as Ken Sanders, a rare book seller out of Utah and security chair of the Antiquarian Booksellers' Association of America.  She speaks extensively with both of them to understand their relationship with the industry and with each other.  I found both players interesting subjects, however I have problems with the way Bartlett uses them.  \\"Uses\\" would be the operative word here; I felt that she exploits their stories and at the same time passes judgement on them.  What should have been an interview becomes a conversation peppered with Barlett's opinions on her subjects and her own doubts about what she is being told.  As a reader, I wanted to come up with my own opinions about these people, but the author simply could not restrain herself.<br /><br />If you have any interest in the rare book industry or have ever been enamored with old books and their markets (or the pursuit of finding that literary treasure a la Antiques Roadshow), this is worth a read.  However, be warned that the author is far from unbiased.  Not bad for an airport find, but \\"The Man Who Loved Books Too Much\\" will not make it onto my \\"books to rescue if my house is burning down\\" list.ain herself.

B003UESJJC|5.0|I bought it, because in Europe we wont get this fantastic set of film-history due to licencing problems.    Fantastic Sound (where do you get a 5.1 Version of \\"Ride of the Valkyries\\") and the Picture looks amazing. I have the DVD Edition of Redux, so i knew some of the specials, but there are quite some other interesting things about the story behind the film and his creation.
B003EYVXUU|5.0|I saw the original last year. I waited patiently for this version to be released on DVD. I was not disappointed. I watch many movies, searching for the ones that I can recommend to my friends and co-workers without hesitation; this one is on that short list. To classify it as \\"yet another vampire movie\\" is incorrect; it is a dark, romantic story that happens to have a vampire in it. The acting is superb. The story is very much in line with the original. If you prefer movies that utilize plot, pacing, and story to achieve success, then watch this. If you prefer movies that are as shallow as a reality television celebrity, see something else. My apologies to the people who made \\"Snakes on a Plane.\\" I enjoyed it even though I was ridiculed by my wife and daughter for purchasing it; it didn't require much thought, but was entertaining. Let Me In is in a different league; comparable with such movies as \\"The Lives of Others\\" and \\"The Road\\" (unrelated, but excellent,  recent movies). Thanks for reading my (novice) review.
B000V86OKG|5.0|I enjoyed this DVD of Season 2 even more than Season 1.  It explores in greater depth what is behind Dexter and his struggles with who he is.

B000O59AFW|2.0|I bought many Blurays although I already own DVD titles before only because I wanted to upgrade into High Def. Some of them are quite satisfying in terms of video quality as well as audio quality.    This one is one of the total failure. Video quality is the same as DVD, MPEG-2. There are a really few bluday titles released in MPEG-2 that have good quality. This isn't.     Audio does not have HD sound because it was released early.     Now I don't even know why I bought this title.     Above all, I think I have waste my money on this. The thing is I don't even wanna keep it.
B0045HCJ6M|5.0|This is a wonderful film, having seen it on stage it has more debth. Yes, some  scs enes drag yet if ever a remake I would hope the \\"book\\" would be expanded.\\"  The music, sets, costumes are simply remarkable, as is the late \\"RICHARD HARRIS,\\"  who I saw perform this on stage. That production had more depth for I think  they added speaches for him. And I don't compare \\"apples from oranges,\\"  or \\"My Fair Lady,\\" which came with a book and \\"Camelot,\\" which didn't. But it  came from many written books.    ONE COMPLAINT: the first review is in the year 2000. Nothing from the newly  released, repackaged version. Been told the only change is packaging. This  has not been restored. And I've seen no one review the packaged one so I felt  you should know that the \\"art\\" looks wonderful but you get the same picture  from years before.    But it is being put together on \\"BLU RAY.\\" And perhaps there will be some  remastering and more extras. Many are included in the dvd versions.  And as for Blu Ray I'm disappointed that they are doing what is bein done  with dvds. Less price for a Blu Ray that only includes the picture. No extras.  So why buy? But I love the combo packs for what I dislike about \\"Blu Ray\\" is that  is should be programmed to play in any dvd player.    Camelot will always be special.

B0046ECFRM|4.0|This book started well with Anna explaining about her life and kept the pace going with passion, friendship and difficult families. It is a typical teen book; how she wants a guy she can't have and friendships get hurt along the way. However, it was still well written and makes you want to keep reading. It is a good holiday read and explains Paris so well it makes you want to go there. I enjoyed it and it kept me up to see what happens next (even if there are some times when I wanted to slap the main characters). Overall it was a good, fast-paced read.
0061726826|4.0|It's interesting that a book in which I could have predicted almost every turn of the story was still an amazing read.  I am a huge fan of Lauren Oliver's writing and this book was a great follow up to her previous book, Before I Fall.  The premise of the story is a refreshing take on the dystopia genre.  I've read other stories that compare love to a disease based on how it can make people feel and behave but I would have never imagined a world in which people would try to \\"cure\\" this affliction.<br /><br />Can you imagine living in a world in which people above the age of 18 couldn't love anyone else.  Couples are paired up based on factors other than love.  This state does leave me with one question that while it is sort of addressed I still did not find the explanation plausible is why do families still exist?  It seems to make more sense that couples would have children that would be raised in some sort of separate community instead of with their parents.  It's hard to imagine people who are incapable of love raising children.  They make mention about how very few people did kill their children because of emotional detachment but really as a parent I can't imagine putting up with infants, toddlers, teens, etc without love giving you patience to get through the hard times.<br /><br />Other than that I liked both Lena and Alex.  Lena wasn't perfect but that made her all the more relatable and the supporting characters of her best friend, Hana, her young cousins and her older sister Rachel all provided a nice foil of how living in this type of world can affect people in different ways.  This is another amazing story from Lauren Oliver.<br />You might also like:

B002ZG993Q|1.0|The most boring movie ever. Waste of time. I kept waiting for it to pick up because the previews made it look like a pretty good spy movie but you will feel duped if that's what you think it is. Clooney spends most of the movie chewing gum and assembling a gun that will eventually be used to kill him. Why not just kill him and get it over with. The sex scenes were over the top and rediculous. The ending stinks as well as the rest of it.
0061726826|4.0|My Summary: Welcome to a world where love is an unwanted disease. 17 year-old Lena Holoway is counting down the days until she undergoes the standard operation to eradicate the potential of developing amor deliria nervosa- love. No love means no pain, and everything and everybody will be content and predictable. But it's day number ninety-five, and Lena catches a glimpse of someone who will send her life spiraling out of control. He takes her breath away. Could this be love? And is it worth her life? The summer days are ticking away, and it's time she followed her heart.    My Review: OHMYGOSH! I dove headlong into this book only vaguely knowing that it was about a girl who was anxiously awaiting for an operation of some sort. To my pleasant surprise, it was SO much more. Humor me for loving this book even more since it's dystopian. I'm madly attracted to this epic genre (though some people argue that the futuristic/defying-the-government love scenario is getting old.)    Moving on... Lauren Oliver has succeeded in weaving a world filled with star-crossed love and sacrifice. There's something innocent about your shorter-than-average 5'2\\" teenager who's scared of love. She's ordinary, average-looking, and doesn't even believe someone will fall in love with her. She's lived her entire life thinking it's a deadly disease that only surgery can cure. The government has spent decades spreading and reinforcing lies. But the glimpse of one boy, Alex, completely uproots every rule Lena was raised to obey. His honey-colored eyes and brunette crown are striking, and his voice: cajoling and gentle. He is undoubtedly the epitome of a perfect lover and firmly sincere in his intentions and beliefs. Through a series ohttp://www.amazon.com/review/edit-reviewf coincidental meetings, they fall in love. Quickly, beautifully, and painfully.    At first, Alex and Lena's romance seemed trivial and shallow. Two inexperienced and cautious lovers who were navigating the waters of emotional infatuation for the first time. But as the story progressed, and the pages began to fly by, I could almost feel the sweet thickness of their raw emotions flooding over me. The story is moderately paced, with a hooking plot and drawn out middle. The ending, however, was deeply instigating and heartbreaking. One girl, one boy, secrets, and a love that is forced to endure the injustice hurled at them by society. Some books are interesting, while others are entertaining. But once I read the very last sentence, on the very last page, I realized, Delirium, is beautiful.    As for the negative side, there wasn't much that struck me as odd or bothersome. The middle is a little slow, and Oliver gives away telltale signs of her inexperience as an author writing \\"suspense\\". She has a magical way with words, however her portrayal of many characters are stereotypical, although, that might be intentional.    Rate & Recommend?:  Yes! DEFINITELY! Delirium is a story that makes you bubbly with every detail and frantic to share every memorable quote with the person sitting next to you. It easily scored a 4.5 out of 5. As I inhaled the ending, so many emotions came crashing down on me, and I couldn't believe the adventure was already over when I flipped the book close. Luckily, I've been informed that Delirium is to be a trilogy! I'd like to end on the note that Lauren Oliver has painted a lyrical masterpiece. It is a MUST read.    -  -  -  visit my blog at:  [...]

B003EYVXTG|3.0|Being from Kentucky, I was excited to see that the lead actress, Jennifer Lawrence is a KY native.  Perhaps this background assisted her in bringing her character to life.  Although this film is set in Missouri, I must say the the resemblances to my own state are pretty close.  Anyone from a area that has high rates of rural poverty and an over-abundance of meth labs are sure to relate with this storyline.    Instead of going into whether this film was good or not... I would like to compare it to the westerns of the 60's and 70's.  This is the type of film that you will either relate to or not; there is no middle ground.  If you have a hard time sitting still and paying attention to the subtleness of things, then this film is probably not for you.  It is quite slow.  However if you enjoy paying close attention to details and can respect rich actor performances, you'll enjoy it.    As with any western, there is always the following character types:  -the protaganist, in charge of taking care of the family farm when the head of the house is gone, who in turn finds her strength  -the snake-ish middle-of-the fence character of conveinence, neither good nor bad throughout, but in the end redeems himself by making the ultimate sacrifice  -the gang of bad-guys, enforcing their criminal behavior upon everyone in town  -the weak sheriff, who chooses to turn his head when the bad guys retaliate  -the money hungry banker, or in this case a bondsman (he could also be compared to a bounty hunter, although we never see him actively pursuing Ree's father) who will take the family farm away from starving children    However, instead of the bad guys losing in the end, they are untimately untouched at the end of the movie, and you are almost made to feel a connection with their strong family bond.    I at first I did not enjoy this movie, as I felt it depicted rural people as backward and ignorant.  But after thinking about it, I realized that this movie is about events that take place all the time.  It is the real world for some, and I think that is probably why Hollywood has made such a fuss over it.  Whether it's the inner-city or hills, the real issue is poverty and how some have chosen to fight against it with the drug trade.
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|I was pretty intrigued by the artwork of \\"Mezmerize,\\" so far System of a Down's second to last album (rumor has it that they could be coming back).<br /><br />Objectivity:<br />The span time of \\"Mezmerize\\" is 36:15. The album features a booklet and art.<br /><br />I didn't feel an impulse to throw this CD away, unlike \\"Hypnotize.\\" Most of this album is fast-paced. \\"B.Y.O.B.\\" is a legitamite outcry to the unfairness of war initiated by America; very fast most of the times; \\"Why do they always send the poor?\\" \\"Revenga\\" provides a unique rapid flow of words; I just don't like that \\"shoulda been, coulda been, woulda been\\" idea. \\"Cigaro\\" is profane but acceptable. \\"Radio/Video\\" pleads for attention. \\"This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm On This Song\\" provides the hardest rhythm of this album; \\"Killers never hurt feelings.\\" \\"Violent Pornography,\\" when it gets to its chorus or hook, has the best rhythm of this album; it presents problematic...well...pornography, but it's catchy. \\"Question!\\" has the weirdest sound on this album; it questions death. \\"Sad Statue\\" is another legit song about how our generation is messing up, but like many other System of a Down songs, it's subtle, abstract, and could be subject to different viewpoints. \\"Old School Hollywood\\" is at least irrelevant and repetitive, but enjoyable. \\"Lost in Hollywood\\" is downright the worse track on \\"Mezmerize,\\" making fun of others; it doesn't even have a pleasant melody.<br /><br />10 out of 11 tracks worth the listen? That's 91%. Doesn't mean that every song is brilliant. Here go the cons:<br /><br />\\"Soldier Side-Intro\\" is a mere short, skip-worthy, poignant and ignorantly selfish.<br /><br />\\"Revenga\\" seems deadly.<br /><br />\\"Cigaro\\" is irrelevant.<br /><br />\\"This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm On This Song\\"---with the title of it, the connotation to, \\"When we're crying for our next fix\\" makes the song suspicious.<br /><br />Now, it comes down (the grade). 5 out of 11 songs didn't get criticized by I. It's the harmonies of this album that make it enjoyable. People should be open to different things like uncommon lyrics like the ones System of a Down are popular for. This is the last album in their discography that I've listened to, so I checked out all their CDs.<br /><br />Professional critics such as Allmusic, Popmatters, and Kerrang! gave \\"Mezmerize\\" a good grade.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I got this DVD for Christmas. I am already a regular gym and workout person, so I figured the video wouldn't really be that hard. SO WRONG.    This is a great video to tone. It targets your arms fast. Within two weeks I could feel how much stronger my arms were and see a difference in the mirror. It also targets your abs, butt and upper thighs. I feel so much tighter after 30 days.    The DVD says you can lose up to 20 pounds in 30 days. I actually lost nothing. But I can see huge results looking in the mirror and more importantly, I lost inches. I lost an inch and a half from my waist in 30 days. That is incredible. I've never done a workout routine that gives results that fast.    The DVD has 3 levels. Each level has 3 circuits. Each circuit has 3 minutes of strength training, 2 minutes of cardio and 1 minute of abs. After the first day of doing level 1 I was so sore going up and down stairs. But push through and you'll feel better in a few days. Level 1 has lots of lunges.  Level 2 focuses on planks. Level 3 incorporates a lot of jump movements.     Jillian never explains exactly when to switch to the next level. (Just \\"when you're ready.) From what I found online, they recommend doing each level for 10 days and then switching to the next.    After finishing the 30 days, I went back to level 1. Some of the moves were easier - I had definitely gotten strong but its still a hard, great workout.
0061726826|5.0|Lena is a 17 year old girl living in a world where love is now regarded as a horrible and deadly disease. Everyone is required to undergo a treatment or \\"cure\\" procedure when they turn 18. After this their lives are basically mapped out for them and they are stripped of any emotions that allow them to feel love.<br /><br />Originally Lena is excited about the procedure. She just wants to get it done and over with and go on living a life that is pretty much mapped out for her. That is, until she meets Alex. Alex ends up changing the way she views the world and the way she views love. He makes her see things about the world she is living in that she refused to see before. From the time she meets him it turns into an amazing love story.<br /><br />I don't even know where to begin with this one as far as my feelings go. It's one of those books that I feel like I just can't put into words. It was absolutely amazing. It caused me such a mix of emotions that I never thought possible. It was a beautiful story that was extremely well written.<br /><br />As much as I was looking forward to the book it far exceeded any expectations that I had for it. I didn't even think that was possible! It is now, beyond a doubt, one of my favorite books of all time.

B002WCLG3O|2.0|Babysitter, Homecoming, Prototype, and both origins were my favorites out of all of them. While Halo Legends features amazing animation from the start (except for the duel), the overall feeling that this gives me is that this was pretty much a cash in. Rather than have a bunch and mix of different directors with different styles they might have been safer choosing one style and director. Having read all the books when I finished watching this it made me think that the directors didn't have a feel for the games or the previous adventures and set out to do their own thing. The package had good animation but was just too corny and over the top. I skipped the duel and odd one out because as a fan of Halo I couldn't stand for how lame this was. If they ever attempt another try at this they need to make it a feature length film with a good plot, they should also keep to the japanese anime style used in prototype, babysitter and homecoming.
B004E547D8|1.0|Bottom line...DO NOT BUY if you are an audiophile. This \\"cheap\\" version of RED does NOT contain DTS-HD MASTER 5.1 audio. It is only a Dolby Digital 5.1 mix. The more expensive version has the DTS-HD MASTER audio mix.    Sorry people. I did not see the movie. i just want people to know who care about the audio/video to know what they are getting cause this small but big matter (to some people) is not really known. i just wanted to inform people.

I actually had a friend of mine who i happened to be working with at the time, him and i gathered info and spoke about this film for a good month or two before it came out.  It was all over the net.  It did pretty good actually, very interesting film.  I went to see this in Long Beach i remember, early in the morning actually.  Great film.  A lot of POV shots, a lot of running and a lot of unanswered questions.  Pretty much, without giving this film away, it is about a frightened creature.  Rising from the depths of the ocean.  Reason? Motive? Watch the movie, see what you get...

B0044RUSZM|3.0|This is a beautiful, space saving laptop stand. I do love it, but NOT for the machine I intended. The description says any laptop over 10\\" - but I would not recommend it for 17\\" machines. The width on this stand is fixed - not adjustable. We are now using it for my little 13\\" machine. Originally, we intended to use it for our 17\\" laptop, but it really isn't deep enough to support the machine - nor wide enough - very precarious. Much of the weight in our 17\\" resides in the back. With the front clips installed on the stand, the back of the laptop hangs over the back edge and teeters off. I would not feel comfortable using this without front clips.    Great stand, but I wouldn't recommend it for any laptop over 15\\"    Otherwise, the quality is great, as is the case with most Griffin products.    Amazon is great - fast shipping and I strongly recommend Prime.
B001UFQNF0|3.0|As huge fan of the Back to the Future films I was ecstatic to receive this replica of the iconic time traveling Delorean as created by Doc Brown.<br /><br />Overall this is a fantastic toy that actually does much more than I thought, almost everything lights up, the headlights, taillights, vents, the bandings around the body and even the Time Circuits but what I was most impressed with is that the Flux Capacitor also lights up and flashes giving this car a real sense of authenticity.<br /><br />Other cool features are the wheels that flip down to convert the Delorean into flight mode as seen in BTTF Part II, even as an adult your tempted to play with it hehe. The vehicle also plays back many different sounds that were taken directly from the film that accompany the various lights, be sure to switch it from 'Try Me' mode to 'Play' mode, though, the switch is located under the hood.<br /><br />Now the drawbacks, I'm not sure why but the DMC logo is missing from the front grill and the name 'Delorean' is also missing from the back bumper, your guess is as good as mine as to why but with some modeling paint and a steady hand the DMC can be added to the front.<br /><br />Another note, when you first receive it you'll notice that Mr. Fusion is missing, don't worry, it's inside in a small plastic bag for you to attach so be sure to look for it when you pull the car out of the box.<br /><br />Also, the coupling boxes on the front of the front wheel wells where the cables connect lack much detail that could have easily been included, I have smaller die cast Deloreans that have much better detail in that area, and the worm hole emitter on the roof is also missing much detail, it's just a gray piece of plastic really.<br /><br />Overall the pros outweigh the cons and since this is a limited edition I would highly recommend picking it up if your a fan of the films or a Delorean enthusiast.
B0034G4OXQ|4.0|Went to see this with family...walked into the theater not knowing what the movie was about.  After the movie i thought it was entertaining...but i could not stop thinking about the movie.  Events or actions take place in your life and they create a turning point.  Highly recommend this movie!
1401307450|5.0|This book is awesome!  The music means so much more after reading this book.  It's especially cool because I was born and raised in L.A. and know many of the places he is referring to in the book.
B003E8P9G0|1.0|Worst book ever!!!!! Yes i know I will get like 1,000+ reasons why I should like it but really? I couldn't even finsh it it was so boring and bland ughhh why would people buy this!?
B003NFM3JK|2.0|This movie is very dark and since we watched both this version of A Christmas Carole and the musical version with Kelsey Grammer, there is no comparison. This version is not fun. Our young son didn't care for it, although my husband liked it far more than I did.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|Amazing video series - highly recommend it! Everyone should watch this and not forget the sacrifice our service men and women made for us to live the lives we have, and also so we do not forget what war is all about. Excellently done, not only in the realism of the war scenes, but also in the scenes that give us a glimpse into the everyday lives of the characters portrayed. I felt like I was walking through this with them, and I did not want to say goodbye at the close!
B0002EXH54|4.0|This is their second album and one of their best. The <<melodies>> from the thrash guitars are crazy and evil...Mustaine is a maniac..you can feel this. Peace sells is one of their best songs in their entire career. I recommend this album to all metal fans.
B0000027RL|5.0|If you haven't listened to Pearl Jam's debut album, \\"Ten\\", then either you haven't been born yet, are too young to know how to operate electronics, or have been in a coma.  This album does not simply contain music.  It contains each and every memory that I have of my childhood wrapped into a 50 minute earth-shattering juggernaut of an experience.  Like I said, if you haven't already bought it, then after slapping yourself for idiocy, go to the nearest record store or itunes and purchase it.
B000002V0Q|5.0|This album with Youthanasia is their best albums. I recommend these two albums to all metal fans. Anyway this album is cool. It has very good melodies and it gives you a flowing metal feeling. Skin on my teeth - This was my life - symphony of destruction are master songs as the others.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I could barely put this book down.  Stieg Larsson grabbed me in the first book didn't let go until the last word of The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Next.  Very well thought out and painstakingly arranged to give the ready the most bang for the buck.  Well worth the time to read this series.  Rest In Peace, Mr. Larsson.
B000002HMH|5.0|Guys this is a masterpiece. I remember how many times i have heard this album. It has great songs . the problem is that is not like the previous Black Album ...and this makes the people get annoyed. Its not so heavy metal. Its heavy but a little more rock than metal. In the beginning i remember i didn't like it too much (i was waiting for a metal album that can be compared to Black album -> Well black album is the best album in the history of heavy metal , its very difficult for an album like this). Anyway i recommend this album to all and to rock and to metal fans.
B004EQAVHI|5.0|Kazuo Ishiguro's best selling novel NEVER LET ME GO has been transformed into a screenplay by Alex Garland that condenses the novel but allows the mystery of the writer's concept to come shining through.  Mark Romanek directs a perfect cast and manages to make the whole strange idea of the story seem hauntingly real.<br /><br />Through the mists of England develops the image of a tranquil appearing old school,  Hailsham,  a special school where the students are all selected, segregated from society to be taught and nurtured into becoming transplant donors.  The school is run by Miss Emily (Charlotte Rampling) who is strict but also benevolent.  The story focuses on three students - Tommy (Charlie Rowe), Kathy (Isobel Meikle-Small), and Ruth (Ella Purnell).  Kathy longs for Tommy's affections but Ruth is the bolder of the two girls and makes her feelings for Tommy known. The only person who brings a semblance of reason and solace to the students is Miss Lucy (Sally Hawkins): she is dismissed as insubordinate for telling the truth to the students. The students age into young people - Tommy (Andrew Garfield) and Ruth (Keira Knightley) have become a couple and have also begun their donations of organs while Kathy (Carey Mulligan) has taken the role of Carer and follows the lives of the two friends.  As Ruth approaches her third organ donation she expects to enter 'completion' and clears her guilt of having taken Tommy from Kathy by joining Kathy and Tommy in a romance that she hopes will lead to a state of delay (the school has always informed them that if two students are truly in love they will be spared their destiny for a while in order to live together).  Tommy is an artist and thinks that by proving his presence of a soul that he and Kathy will be granted this choice.  Hailsham has now closed and the two seek the art gallery curator for the school Madame (Nathalie Richard) to request permission, only to be met by both Miss Emily and Madame with the reality that the concept has been a false one all along.  The destiny of the students is served.<br /><br />The trio of actors - Mulligan, Garfield, Knightley - is superb, seducing us into believing in the story. The supporting roles as performed by Rampling, Richard, and Hawkins are equally strong.  This film, as the book, requires the audience to relinquish disbelief in the premise and instead bask in the beauty of the story, the acting, the lush cinematography by Adam Kimmel and the stunningly lovely musical score by Rachel Portman. Highly Recommended.  Grady Harp, February 11t has been a false one all along.  The destiny of the students is served.

B0002EXH40|5.0|Yes this album is probably their best. All of the songs are incredible. I recommend this album to all metal fans. Just amazing album, Highly recommended to all. Up the Irons
0448444216|3.0|Cute story but way too much white space and the muted animals were not that interesting to my grandson. The flaps present no challenge and the fact that this is not a board book would give it a short shelf life if he bothered reading it more than once. This one was phoned in and not up to the colorful standard of other Carle favorites.
030746363X|5.0|I own Timothy Ferris' book \\"The Four Hour Workweek\\".I loved it so,I knew I had to buy this book.He has not let me down.I just started reading it and I am about a quarter of the way through.I am already putting his advice into action.
B003405MF6|5.0|For my money, no other guitarist in the world can evoke the same level of grace from his or her axe as Jeff Beck.  By grace, I don't mean technical ability (even though Mr. Beck is unsurpassed in that area).  Rather, I mean the long, sustained tone and color that cries and tears right through your soul.  Brian May and David Gilmour are the only other guitarists in popular music that tell stories with their insturments that are this rich, colored, emotional, and in the same vein....but Jeff Beck is a master.  Just listen to the track \\"Where Were You\\" that came before this album and you'll know what I mean.     I can't say anything else about this album that hasn't been said in other reviews. If you like the smooth, soulful Beck (long sustained bends, searing emotional solos), this may become your favorite album by him.  It is marvelous and a testament to this man's total control over his instrument, the ultimate objective of any serious musician.  Purchase this album immediately.  It is awesome.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|I picked this unit up mostly on the description on Amazon and the detailed reviews.  I figured at a minimum it would be adequate, I am pleased that it works better than expected.  Everyone has their opinions about sharpeners and the BEST way.  This is mine... I am an avid knife user and collector. I frequently maintain all of my knives which include EDC folder, kitchen, field/camp/hunting.  I prefer them to be surgery sharp.  When I have the time I profile/reprofile as needed and wet-stone in many steps to do this.  This has become a necessity b/c retail sharpening has become a lost art!  I number of years ago I took my work chistles to a local HW store who contracted them out to a local guy.  This \\"old timer\\" did a great job, then the HW store for whatever reason started using a new guy who in one fell swoop literally ruined a set of Marples chistles I had for a decade!  He basically grinder-sharpened them...my 4 year old daughter could have done a better job sharpening them on the sidewalk!  Hence the reason I became proficient in sharpening skills.  This unit does not make the edge surgery sharp, BUT in the instances where time or personal skill is lacking it will put a respectable edge back on your blade until you can take the process [if you desire] to a higher level.  I have a mid-line \\"working-knife\\" that I beat the S**t out of in the field and this sharpener gets it back into service quickly.  For my higher end knives like Spyderco they offer free factory resharpening which is nice.  I don't know how much the replacement stones are for this unit, it may be cheaper to just purchase another one...?  I also can't attest to the longevity of this sharpener yet.  but so far it has proven to be an excellent value.
B003XQM2YU|4.0|I don't know why this movie doesn't get more fanfare. I did not see the theatrical release, but the unrated version is great! Superb scenery and costumes. Great stars and performances. The combat sequences are great (no brainless hordes and masses like 300, and so many other movies succumb to).Good plot with twists and turns. You need to watch it at least a couple times to understand all the subterfuge going on. I think it is Scott's best work, and a wonderful presentation of the 12th century.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I bought this documentary for my father.  I thought the price was more than reasonable so it was no brainer.<br /><br />I watched a couple of discs with my dad, and it was GREAT!.  Picture quality, sound, takes... everything is just fantastic.<br /><br />I recomend this pack for any nature lover.
B0043JDUNS|4.0|Great movie! I am a fan of the Comic books and I'm not easy on comic book movies. The action sequences are great. The Hammer character was comedic, yes, but also great and perfectly played by Mr. Rockwell. Although, I like Rourke's recent performances, I thought the Whiplash character was kinda cheesy-and could have been eliminated for screen-time for the other characters.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|This is a great action movie, and the kind you'd expect from Bruce Willis.  If you're looking for something like The Departed, then, no, this isn't the movie for you.  I really can't understand why any of the previous reviewers saw fit to complain that this wasn't an in-depth, emotionally driving story.  It's an ACTION MOVIE, and it's GOOD.  The fight scene between Franks and Cooper alone was worth it, and that's just about the midway point of the movie.  John Malkovich was hilarious, Helen Mirren was perfect as always, Brian Cox was a surprise, as I didn't know he was in it, but he was great, too.  Karl Urban was a real selling point in this movie and just further proves that Karl Urban needs to be in more movies, preferably physically assaulting the crap out of someone.    Look, it's an action movie, it's good, and John Malkovich has a stuffed pig.  Watch the movie.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|Very interesting ending to a good book. The author had a great way of pulling it all together. Wish there would be more books by him.
B00418NVMQ|5.0|Halestorm has true talent. Lzzy's vocals are amazing! I love this album. the best live cd/dvd I heard. I paid $19 for it, but it would be worth more than that. Highly recommended for those who like hard work and live cd/dvds.
B003Q6D1YW|1.0|I believe that this film should actually be called \\"SUCKER\\". Jeez, I'm glad I didn't buy it. The hype was very good! Too bad the film was not. If by now people don't realize meeting people by way of the internet is a \\"crap shoot\\" than the are really naive.
B001SGEUNI|5.0|My brother told me about this band, so i tried them out. I heard \\"It's Not You\\" and I liked it. I made the cd...all I have to say is....AMAZING album! one of my favs that I have ever listened to. Lzzy has great vocals for a hard rock band. Really would pick the best band out of any other bands with girl singers.
0316098337|1.0|Even if you can buy the premise (and it's a tough sell) it's hard to get past the 5-year-old narrator who treats the inanimate objects in his life as if they're people, calling them Room, Melty Spoon, Wardrobe, Rug...what's up with that? Do you know any 5-year-olds who do that? Perhaps the little guy's mentally challenged, and who wouldn't be if he lived in an 11' X 11' room for his whole life and was never able to leave. It's an interesting vehicle to try telling the story from his perspective - too bad it doesn't work.<br />It took about 85 pages (way too many and I have no explanation why I kept at it) to get semi-involved and then there's kind of an exciting part in the middle (SPOILER ALERT) where they escape from The Room and then...well, who cares? Nothing of real interest happens after that.<br />Not completely relevant but throughout the story (ANOTHER SPOILER ALERT) this kid is breast-feeding, which was really distasteful (no pun intended) and totally unnecessary. He's FIVE, for Pete's sake. Ick.<br />If I liked either the boy or mom it would have helped immensely but not only is the premise a tough sell but the characters are as well, and that's a bad combo.
B003WTE886|5.0|Taylor's done it again! Her best album yet! Strong vocals, amazing lyrics, amazing songs! Great job, Taylor! You never dissapoint.
B004KPLVW2|5.0|Very happy with the final announcement which according to sources is scheduled to release on April 5th, but on the other hand not terribly happy with the horrendous cover art! The 20th anniversary DVD cover art was substantially better, heck my placeholder blu-ray cover art for TRON blu-ray on Amazon is better than this! Oh well, guess we'll just have to make our own cover art. Hope the special features from the 20th DVD edition are retained and maybe even expanded.
B000PTYPAC|5.0|Paramore is the best! Their lyrics, vocals, and everything are #1. Now I know why this cd was such a hit. It's amazing!
B0041KKYDS|5.0|Aron Ralston (portrayed brilliantly by James Franco) is a real individual, and this film is the story of 127 hours of his life - the 127 hours that changed him forever (both literally and figuratively). While hiking in Utah, a rock is wedged free and falls on his arm, pinning him in a deserted cavern far away from civilization. Without cell service, limited water, and options, Ralston must decide how much he wants to live, and how far he is willing to go to leave his fateful predicament. If you haven't heard of this story in the news, I won't spoil what happens. If you have heard, don't NOT see this movie because you think it will be too disgusting. Boyle has a way of making even the most horrid of moments emotionally moving - and you can always squint.<br /><br />Overall, this is one of the best movies of the year. It's not just a movie about getting stuck and the will to survive. It's a film about how important life is, no matter where you're at in your life.
B002FRNCG0|5.0|It was a fall September day. my sis bought this album. I bought miranda lambert's hit album, revolution. Well,  my sis played this quite often and i fell in love. THIS ALBUM IS THE BEST ALBUM I HAVE EVER HEARD! I really wish she would give me this album. because of this wonderful record, I am totally obsessed with paramore. i will definately be buying their next album. hayley's vocals are wonderful. the best band ever. i love the lyrics and the songs. they just show....passion and grace. My favorite one is \\"Careful!\\"<br />1. Careful: 5/5 stars. Wonderful story with cool attidude. true song.<br />2.

B00008IHN1|5.0|This fictionalized account of what life is like to have \\"the black marching band experience,\\" brings back so many memories, that each year before the super bowl, I drag it out and watch as if it were a family religious rite. Why do I do this?<br /><br />Because, although the movie conflates the marching band and college fraternity experiences -- obviously in a crude attempt to enrich the former -- that conflation was totally unnecessary. For, of all the experiences that a young struggling black student could have, it would be difficult to beat that of becoming a member of a marching band. To wit: learning how to master a musical instrument; how to read and appreciate music of all varieties; gaining self-confidence through this mastery; and most important of all learning how to excel at a craft whose only predicate is not just \\"making money.\\"<br /><br />As well, there is the constructive collaboration with fellow students, other schools, professional artists, etc. that the movie brings out beautifully. There is also the intense competition and rivalries, which although they also have many positive aspects, can and often do get out of hand. There is the close interaction between students and their band directors, who, more often than not, are proficient in music and on several musical instruments themselves. And thus more often than not, band directors serve as more than just overseers and administrators of the students they teach. They are more like mentors, with the students being their apprentices.<br /><br />But this is not all: The movie did not depict what happens to those who find success in those bands. Not only do most of them go one to become well-adjusted, socially successful productive citizens, but also successes professionally. In fact one of the best kept secrets in the black social realm is that it is the black college band that is the \\"feeder system\\" for most of the black professional musicians, including Jazz musicians and concert and symphony orchestra musicians. And as strange as it may seem, it is the black college band that is also in large measure responsible for black professionals in other areas such as law, medicine, and even engineering.<br /><br />Why is this so? I think it is mainly true for two reasons. First there are so few opportunities for black kids to get on a secure track that can lead to consistent self-development. The band, like sports is one such alternative track. And second because of the Darwinian process involved in both sports and music: only the strong can survive the rigorous schedules involved in balancing normal studies with the discipline involved in mastering a horn or sports at the same time. Everything about the black band experience as it turns out is profound and sound preparation for life. When you complete your tenure in a band, you are master of at least one important thing in life: your instrument.<br /><br />Which brings me to my final point about the movie. When I saw this year's Fourth of July parade, in which the DC black high schools were represented by overweight baton twirlers accompanied by a ragtag drum corps, it took my breath away and left a knot in my stomach. I was not ready for this surprise. For in that instant, viewing these faux black bands, I saw the arc of a whole generation of black failures marching in lock step into a dark American future.<br /><br />By not supporting inner city music programs, while hiring an expensive Superintendent, Michelle Rhee, to further cut the budgets, under the pretext of making the schools better, DC had made its choice: \\"To hell with enriching the lives of inner city kids, we are trying to save the taxpayer money at all cost? It is school vouchers and gutting the public schools as far as the eye can see, that can make the difference (in the budget but not in the quality of the schools).\\"<br /><br />No, Rhee has got it all wrong:The way to make a difference in DC schools (as well as all the other inner city schools in the U.S.) is to implement the 1954 Supreme Court Decision to the letter instead of rendering it null and void, and then make sure that all black kids have the same right to enter music programs as white kids do. QED. Five Stars.
B003L77TZI|5.0|We purshased the first album which we really didn't like. But then we bought this one, and everything has completely turned around. katy perry did awesome on this album!
0385341679|5.0|I just completed reading ShadowFever and I was not disappointed. Karen has once again taken us into Mac's world and left us spinning in circles, right up to the very end.<br />  Many questions are answered and although this series has come to an end I do not see an end to Mac's universe and I see several stories yet to be told taking place in the new Dublin.<br />  If you have read any of the previous Fever books, you will definitely want to read this one. It answers so many questions that we have been asking since book number 1. Karen<br />Marie Moning is a true story-teller and I look forward to her next series.
B001QXE0OC|4.0|Selena did a good job with this cd. Its good. Here are a few things I recommend though: The vocals are not really good. Umm...the lyrics are cookie cutter popstar cheesy...Good job though! I like all of the songs.
0439796644|5.0|Although War Horse by Michael Morpurgo is a Scholastic book for children, this endearing story will relate to readers of all ages. No wonder Spielberg is making a movie based on this book. Because of this publicity, I wanted to read this story which was published in 1982 but I had never heard of it. Also, I was curious about the format since it is written in first person point of view - from the horse, Joey!<br /><br />Like Black Beauty, Joey explains his earliest memories as a colt, his traumatic weaning and life with a British farmer's son, Albert. The pair become very close as the teenager teaches him the basics about horsemanship, and later about riding and driving.<br /><br />Then World War I changes their idyllic life. Joey is sold to the military and is trained as a cavalry mount and later pulls military wagons such as canons. He meets interesting horses and people, and the scenes kept me turning the pages. I especially loved the scene in No Man's Land.<br /><br />Although I knew he would be reunited with his beloved Albert, the circumstances were not predictable.<br /><br />Wow, what a fantastic story! I look forward to seeing the movie.<br /><br />Visit the author's site at [...]
B001IB63KQ|5.0|Awesome live cd and dvd. I could never get tired of it. Paramore did an amazing job, and Hayley did good with her vocals. This set is addicting and I could never get tired of it.
B001E9641K|5.0|I'm a big fan of the Ticket to Ride games. This is the first one I've owned. I picked this one because I wanted to learn more about the Nordic Countries, though it didn't occur to me at the time that I'd have no idea how to pronounce the names of the cities! My mother-in-law has low vision, so this game was difficult for her to play because of the unfamiliar territory. I think that she would have liked the US or European map because she would have been more familiar with where the cities were in general.
B0009W5K0Y|5.0|the debut album from the awesome band called Paramore. its a hit! a great album. 5 stars.<br />All We Know 4/5 nice song about Jeremy leaving the band before he came back<br />Pressure 4/5 one of the truest songs. nice tune<br />Emergency 5/5 wonderful song. one of my favs<br />Brighter 5/5 another one of my favs. sweet song<br />Here We Go Again 5/5 nice song with a magnificent ending!<br />Never Let This Go 4/5 a song about love gone terribly wrong. ha i like this song alot<br />Whoa 5/5 catchy song to sing along to<br />Conspiracy 5/5 a really nice song with a beautiful intro<br />Franklin 5/5 MY FAV song off this album and my 2nd fav song from Paramore. something special to it. beautiful song with josh's wonderful backing vocals.<br />My Heart 5/5 what a wonderful, sweet song. nice screamo. one of their bests efforts
B001TH16DI|5.0|A/V absolutely amazing! I've never seen it this great. Worth every penny!  I believe this is the best set you can get on the market. So if you haven't upgraded to Blu-ray, this is what you'd want to buy.    Questions? Comments?  Leave some feedback and Amazon should auto alert me to it. I'll try and help you with deciding to buy this or not.
B000002LCB|5.0|The soundtrack to \\"The Princess Bride,\\" Rob Reiner's adaptation of William Goldman's book, is as good as the film. One of my favourite tracks is \\"Florin Dance.\\" I also like \\"Morning Ride,\\" \\"The Swordfight,\\" \\"Once Upon A Time... Storybook Love\\" and \\"Storybook Love.\\" I highly recommend this soundtrack.
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|Whether you call her music Afro-Punk or Urban Alternative, this is the best album since T.V. On The Radio's \\"Return To Cookie Mountain\\" (2006).  Beautiful, creative, hip-hop-rock performed by a super talented phenom!  This album is a classic!
B0043EV774|5.0|dont know how much i can say about a movie that can put you right in it but love it
B0018BB20W|5.0|This is a splendid concept album by The Moody Blues. As musical journey through both day and night, I'd say that it's an excellent achievement in the band's part. The songs fit very well with the natural tone that they're striving for. The song that especially works is the famous \\"Nights in White Satin,\\" which is almost divine in its music and lyrics. Score one for the Moody Blues for that song. Actually, score one for the entire album. Days of Future Passed is a classic concept album, and it deserves huge praise.<br /><br />There IS one problem I have with Days of Future Passed, though : the poems \\"Morning Glory\\" and \\"Late Lament.\\" They sound a bit corny sometimes, but otherwise, they sound decent.<br /><br />Grade: 8.7/10
0465043577|4.0|As a Series-7 licensed investment advisor, I felt pretty confident that I'd be able to follow what this book was about - as I work with the numbers of the market every day.    Wrong.    Totally went over my head. Financiers beware. Unless you're a mathematician on the side, this book might do you little more than add sex-appeal to your nerdy bookshelf.
0307474275|4.0|Okay, it took me a while, but I, too, got caught up in the hype. First I read Angels and Demons, which I like more than this one, but this has its own intriguing plot: the search for the Holy Grail.<br /><br />I can't believe the amount of time and research Dan Brown had to go through just to write this thing. I'm no historian or teacher, but I do know a thing or two about writing. I wouldn't want the tedious, never-ending job of finding out where to get ANY of this information.<br /><br />But somehow he did. He did it well, too. This book is already pretty much a classic, and I think it should be. I wouldn't tell anyone to take it as 'the gospel truth'. I don't think it was intended to be. I think this book was written to spark and start fires of curiosity in people's minds; to open up the vault of wonder in all of us.
031603438X|3.0|Life is an excellent book and a must read for any Stones fans.  Especially interesting was the early history of Jagger and Richards and the in's and out's of band life, that any musician will surely appreciate.  I also enjoyed the descriptions of Richards' unique relationship with John Lennon and Beatles and the give and take between bands during a time when both groups were tearing up the charts with hot new songs. Richards' description of the drinking and drugging was everything and more than I expected.  On a different note, I quit reading the book about 2/3rds of the way through. It was getting monotonous and sounding like an AA 4th step diary.  So the only reason why I didn't give it all 5 stars is that the book just became tedious. Otherwise, it's a great book and one that any Stones fan should have on their bookself.

0345479092|2.0|I was recommended this book by a friend, and I must say that it has some good information. It is well-written and the more you read it, the more you like the author. It has good information on how to interpret your baby's cries. I think it's really meant for FIRST TIME parents because experienced parents probably already know how to interpret a baby's cries. Additionally, it gives no mention of older siblings in the entire book, which leads me to believe that the book is for new parents and most (if not all) of her clients were first time parents. I like the part about YOU (the Y in EASY) because many first time moms forget that they need rest, relaxation, and solid nutrition. The whole EASY concept is clever and I like it *in theory* but it's quite difficult to implement (esp. when you have a toddler in the house that requires nearly as much attention as the baby), because, hey, we all know that it is difficult to get a baby to sleep...that's why there are hundreds of books out there written on how to get your baby to sleep.    This book has very little useful scientific information, in fact, it mentions some statement about scientists in a lab creating milk that will be even more nutritionally sound than breast milk...hmmm...ok... yeah, pretty much just ignore most of what she says about breastfeeding. It's obvious she's not a true advocate for it. She also bashes Dr. Sears and La Leche League, which IMO are much more reliable sources than some nanny to the stars.     Just look at the back cover of the book and the only people endorsing it are Hollywood types (producers, screenwriters, and actors)....people that have no experience in nutrition, medicine, or child psychology.
031603438X|5.0|I would start this review with a warning to readers that only Keith Richards can say negative or critical things about Mick Jagger<br />and only Mick can counter him with his own oppinion.I would not take sides or would ever try  to make peace in between them if I would be in the position to do so,you may get beat up by them .Even in his meanest words towards Mick you can sense love and rather bitterness from Keith ,but who knows is most of the kinky or silly stuff very well just and added color to the book for their own entertainment. They are as close and tight as ever after all they are the Glimmer Twins and as Keith said it, he is the Pop in this<br />marriage and they can't divorce and leave a larger then them child on his own.Also you can't split up Rock & Roll ,  The readers<br />that are doom sayers  or anti Rolling Stones all of you are not reading the book right. His drug habits and drinking are opened up and<br />looked at by him like it was , elegantly done and in control ,never turned blue in someone elses bathroom ,he thinks that, it is the<br />rudest thing a person could do. His love towards music and family shows a deep caring man and in this including the whole Rolling<br />Stones family.His extraordinary talent earned him respect and Icon status that he said sometimes hard to live up to, some of the<br />legend about him and his lifestyleis not recommended by him and you would need that endless sours of income he has..He made funny jokes on himself that was blown out of irreversable proportion and can't even change it now himself, like the blood change  and the snorting.<br />The book is very funny really ,just like the interviews he gives and loughs at himself and his views , probobly thinking I can say<br />anything you will like it. He  looks the part and acts the part and writes the part of being the one and only individual that made<br />himself larger then life, sofisticated ,charismatic ,elegant yet very down to earth superstar that millions idoliz and try to imitate.<br />But there is only one individul you can call Keith Richards on Earth is the man behind the book called LIFE. It is an entertaning and<br />highly recommended book by me and  a  5 star rated because that was the highest I could give. Thanks for the opportunity to review this<br />book ,Sandor Fonadere is only one individul you can call Keith Richards on Earth is the man behind the book called LIFE.

B003ZJ70W4|1.0|I rented this movie to pass time during a blizzard. I thought I would watch a cute comedy, drink a glass of wine and get some laughs, I only laughed a couple of times.  I enjoyed SATC the series and the 1st movie was pretty decent. The second movie....... not so much.     The gay wedding scene, for me was not that bad, the Liza Minnelli \\"single ladies\\" performance, I could deal with that, I thought it was slightly funny.     Carrie started whining about not going out every night, really Carrie; you are 1,000 years old, too old to be on the scene all of time. Younger women laugh at older women like Carrie's character who are always on the scene; you look pathetic. I am not married but the t.v. in the bedroom and Carrie thinking she is too cool to stay in w/ her husband being a big problem in the marriage was lame, immature, and made Carrie look like an old pathetic brat.     For the first time Miranda was actually the cool one; she was more chilled out, and the only person who was the voice of reason on their trip to Abu Dhabi.    Charlotte, a dumb plot, I mean storyline; there was no plot. Who is going to allow their nanny to walk & play around their children and husband w/o wearing a bra; come on.     The trip to Abu Dhabi was pointless, I was expecting the plot to begin once they arrived in the U.A.E. That did not happen. There was no plot. I have been to the U.A.E. I thought they would use the movie as a platform to break stereotypes about the middle east, they just reinforced them. The biggest one is that all women in that part of the world wear a veil, not true. Many of the women dress just like us. Samantha seemed tired and trashy,in America if a women grabs her dates crotch in the middle of a restaurant there would be plenty of people who would by outraged by it, why make it seem like the middle east is overly sexually repressed in that situation.    I was done when Carrie ran into Aidan in Abu Dhabi, so dumb. Kissing him, calling her husband to tell him about her misstep, and upon her return home he rewards her with a diamond. I pretty sure that just does not happen.     I was hoping the ladies would be growing old gracefully and being an example to younger women about accepting who you are at every age. But instead Carrie is old and whiny, Charlotte is an airhead, Samantha is a tired tramp, and all wore bad make up and even worse clothes.
B0040UAYI4|4.0|For someone who is toggle switch challenged like me, this devise allows me to \\"not suck so badly\\" at FPS games.  The mouse has challenges especially when you are trying to turn around or swing a torret but it allows me to aim more accurately and quicker than the toggle switch.  Some additional benefits are the ability to program combos to one button and assign buttons that make sense to you.  One warning though - product came with all switches set to turbo - turn these off so that you can hold buttons down without issues i.e. zoom, jumping, etc.  Item was very easy to set up and I am please with its performance.
B003L20IFQ|1.0|This movie is terrible. You first of all don't care what happens to the main character as he is not likable at all. He is lazy and does nothing to help his situation except scream in a phone. He apparently can hear people talking and music so he obivously not buried too deeply. Only at the end do they attempt to pull at your heart strings. Don't waste your time you should bury yourself in a coffin and try to get yourself out as this will be more entertaining then this movie could ever be.
B0023SDPS6|1.0|I've read Craig Johnson's \\"Dark Horse\\" on my Kindle for $9.99. I thoroughly enjoyed it and wanted to read the series from the beginning. Much to my surprise I'm finding that older, backlisted books in this series are priced at a ridiculous price of $12.99 and higher. That is just highway robbery and I will be either forego the pleasure of reading Mr. Johnson's earlier works or find them at a local used bookstore.    Please spare me the comments about writing a review of a book I haven't read, I've heard all the arguments and in many ways I agree, but this is one of the few forums for expressing discontent of the publisher's greed driven decisions. Anyone who will take the time to actually read this review will understand my rating has nothing to do with Mr. Johnson's writing and everything to do with the publisher trying to wring the last penny out of it's customers. I, for one, refuse to be taken for an idiot and will not pay prices that indicate that I am one.
B00005JOA0|3.0|This DVD is OK, but not my favorite by a long shot.  It's dark and disturbing.  I've seen worse BBC Videos, but I've also seen better.  I don't like some of the Cameraman's way of inserting flashes of the past into the scene, and when they did show intact scenes from the past, I couldn't tell where the past scenes ended and the present scenes started. The Female main character acted so bazaar and unlikeable through most of the movie and it's not until the last quarter of the mini series that you find out why she's acting that way. I think this Mini Series could have been done much better by a different director, cameraman and screen play writer. The actors were good, but they should have re-thought the female actresses hairstyle, it did nothing for her face.
0439023521|5.0|As I write this review there are now 1,756 reviews already posted; which is a lot of reviews when you think about it.  I seriously doubt if I will be able to add one thing in my little effusion here that has not already been said but since it will soon be buried and will probably never be read by another human I suppose that will not matter much.<br />Anyway....<br /><br />I have to tell you that like many folks here I was absolutely hooked on the first page and went through torment when I had to put the thing down in order to eat several times and to sleep once.  I cannot remember when a book captivated me so.<br /><br />The plot has been given a pretty well going over here so I will not dwell on that much.  The story, as told through the words of a young girl, takes place in a future totalitarian society; America, after things have gone horribly wrong.  There is a place called the Capitol which pretty well runs everything and the country has been broken up into twelve districts (There is a thirteenth district but in this book it has been supposedly completely obliterated.)  Because these districts had, 75 years ago rebelled against the Capital, they are required to give up two of the children each year, a boy and a girl.  These kids are taken to an arena and forced to fight to the death until only one is left. The people in each of these districts are treated like slaves and for the most part are simply starved or worked to death in the end.<br /><br />That in brief, is the essence of the story.<br /><br />Is this somewhat brutal?  You bet it is.  Is this somewhat horrifying?  Most certainly.  Is the story plot realistic?  Unfortunately, yes it is...quite believable.  And this is why so many are reading this work and the two books that follow in this series.  The author has done her job.  Most of us are horrified and most of us do see the brutality in the situation and most of us deplore it.  To be quite frank, I would quite worry about someone who was not horrified and a bit disturbed.<br /><br />I have some random thoughts about this book:<br /><br />The writing is good.  We are not talking high literature here, and thank goodness for that.  We are talking about a well written story that, after reading the many reviews here and on other sites, holds the readers interest page after page. Excellent plot, excellent dialog, lots of action, very fine character development...it is all here.  Maybe it is not to everyone's taste, but it most certainly satisfies the reading needs of a lot of folks...both young and old.<br /><br />The premise of this story is certainly not new.  Right off the top of my head I think of the old story \\"The Lottery,\\" and a more recent novel by Stephen King, \\"The Long Walk.\\"  Both are similar but this idea is no worse the wear for being used again and I really think this author got it better than King did with his shot at it.<br /><br />Designating this work as a YA book is really a bit inaccurate as the age group who will enjoy this thing has a very wide range and in many ways the book is more suited for the adult reader than the pre-teen.  I personally would have no problem with a younger child reading this thing, but each child is so different that this would be a hard call to make.  I do have a great problem with those folks who seem to want to ban this work from school libraries...that is one of the silliest things I have ever heard of.  Folks who want this have no clue as to what their children are reading right now.  I recently read three YA books by different authors.  In those three books there were vivid descriptions of vampires sucking the blood out of the necks of virgins, (and a goodly number of non-virgins), blatant and casual recreational drug use, sex, group sex (a cool thing to do, by the way), gang rape (no big deal), infidelity, murder, robbery....oh where to stop?  I can assure you that none of these subjects were addressed in this book.  No folks, our libraries are no longer filled with `Little House in the Big Woods' books...it is more like `Little Meth House in the Big Woods'...truth be told.<br /><br />The concept of having a drawing to decide which child (ages 12 through 18) be sent off to fight to the death is upsetting to be sure.  On the other hand, does anyone here remember a thing called The Draft?  We have been sending children, and make no mistake, an 18 year old is still something of a child, off to fight and die in wars since the beginning of so called civilization.  This concept of not putting children in harms way has never held much water.  During most of our previous wars we had children, young men, as young as 15 fighting and dying in them.<br /><br />The author has done a very nice job with the violent scenes.  They are well done, not gratuitous in the least bit, are an important part of the story  and not overly graphic when compared to a lot of books that are on our shelves today.<br /><br />Taste in books is wide ranging.  This book will not be for everyone.  I personally found in one of the better reads I have had over the past ten years are so and am already on the third volume of this series and dread that it will soon be over.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarkstle Meth House in the Big Woods'...truth be told.

B003YFIUW8|5.0|Makes you think about things differently. Fascinating, quick read. You go through the roller coaster of emotions with the characters. A must read.
0316098337|5.0|So many readers rave about the Stieg Larsson books, but this unique book about  unspeakable crimes, told with the engaging narrative voice of a 5-year-old boy transcends those other books, as possibly one of the best novels of the past few years. This may be one of the few books that you should read where you should skip the book jacket copy and plunge right in. Due to events that happened prior to the opening scene, Jack and his mother live in a world that is confined in more ways than one.  But their relationship is riveting, and its a testament to Emma Donoghue's skills as a writer that you will remember her characters, and their story, for a very long time after you finish reading this book. I plan to hear Ms. Donoghue read on Sunday from this book at a panel of Irish writers at Princeton University, and I am very much looking forward to this event.
1439181780|5.0|A very uplifting/tranforming book that follows on from the film entitled 'The Secret'  I have just completed reading this book and have found that I continue to revisit sections. I would urge anyone to read this book, be open minded, you will not be disappointed. It's a treasure. And for many as I - if you allow it, will change your life.
B00081U7HC|5.0|Love this movie inside and out. Strongly recommend.
1400052173|5.0|This was one amazing book, I didn't expect much since my sister just gave me the gist of it but you get so involved with the really individuals of the book that you feel like you have met them before. It was a different way of writing then I am used to but it worked perfectly for this story. Buy the book and you will love the story! Enjoy!
0439023521|5.0|I had seen press about this series here and there, but hadn't thought much about it until my friend's 14 yr old told me it was her favorite book. I loved that it made her think about so many issues, from the necessity of questioning/challenging authority in order for a society to function in a healthy way to the sheer idiocy and cruelness of reality TV!    The series did not disappoint. The first couple of chapters of the first book are a bit slow (lots of character development, very little by way of plot), but the action (and strong political message) intensifies quickly after that and continues through all three books.    In short: It's a quick read (I finished the trilogy in about 3 weeks. If I hadn't been so busy during those weeks I likely would have finished it in 3 days), but incredibly thought-provoking. Highly recommend.
0553328255|5.0|Hullo.   These are the best books I've bought in a while, certainly not a disappointment. Conan Doyle is actually a literary genius and his work never fails to draw you in. Perfect for those who have a bit of a soft spot for crime, drama and plots that never fail to suck you in.  The books are in exceptionally good condition too, arrived within a few weeks of me ordering them (impressive because they were shipped from America)  I'd recommend the books and the site for high quality and no disappointment.
B0036EH3XE|5.0|Lost   While watching the television show Lost its hard not to get, well, lost. During the sixth season it's important to pay close attention in order to catch all of the underlining meaning. Lost, from a Christian perspective, has a lot of inner struggles of good and evil. It's easy to see these struggles more clearly in all of the characters as the show goes on. However, some of the changes are so subtle that from a non-Christian perspective it may not be noticeable at all. For most of the final episodes the inner struggles of the characters are more prominently displayed in both the present and the \\"flash backs\\". It's easy to see these struggles in the main character, Jack. Jack throughout the last season must come to grips with his struggles with the black smoke, to his sudden launch into a position of control, and with his alcoholic father's death.    The inner struggles of good and evil are prominently displayed in Jack. These struggles start for Jack almost as soon as he comes back to the island and they do not end until his death. From the beginning, Jack is thrust into a position of leadership mostly because he's the island only doctor. But during the final season he becomes even more so when the \\"others\\" leader, Jacob, dies. Jacob, up until this season, had been only someone that was referred to when things needed to be done. He was simply always just someone to use as an excuse as to why things were the way that they are. This is a lot like the way many people view God. Just as a person who, when things can't be otherwise explained, we tend to blame. When Jacob is murdered in a plot set up by the black smoke, otherwise known as Locke, Jack chooses to take up the position of leader. Thus in my theory making him the new god of the island and forcing him into an even deeper battle between good and evil. This I will try and explain further in the following paragraphs.    During the `flash backs' and the present it's easy to see the subtle influences of a Godlike figure in Jack. Jack once he had taken on the role as leader really developed a selfless attitude much like the one God had for us. When he took on the role as the \\"good\\" leader of the island he basically gave up his life. When he took on the role he knew that he would never be able to leave. But he was okay with that and was even okay with the fact that in order to save the island he himself would have to die. This is a lot like the story of Jesus in that God saw that the earth needed a savior. And in order to save it he became flesh and came into the world to give his life to save us. An example of how Jack did this is when Desmond went into the underground cave to unplug the energy so that Locke would be able to get off the island. Instead of simply getting off the island with everyone else he went back, saved Desmond, and ultimately ended his life. This is symbolic of how even when Jesus could have simply turned his back on us because we are stupid, he instead went to the cross so that we may have life.      From a Christian perspective, the struggle Jack faces when he loses his dad is more than just emotional. It's spiritual as well. You can clearly see this inner battle during Jacks' `flash backs'. In his `flash backs' Jack must first learn to love and treat his son the way that he always wanted to be treated. Before he is able to move on and come to terms with losing his own dad. This is a lot like the way that we come to God. In order to come to God we must first go to his son, Jesus.  \\"I am the way the truth and the life. No one comes to the father except through me.\\"  (John14:6)  They also talk about something that was being said throughout the last couple of episodes. \\"I hope someone will do for you what has been done for me.\\" What this means of course is I hope that someone will open your eyes to the `flash backs' the way that mine have been opened. But from a Christian context it could mean that I hope that someone will open your eyes to God the way mine were.   In the `flash backs', which we find out later is really a heaven like place; Jack finally finds his way to where he belongs. In the last couple of scenes Jack finally see his father again. They have a quick discussion about what the `flash backs' really are and then they start to go deeper into what it means that their there. To me during that discussion all I could think about was how it relates to the discussion I imagine myself having with God one day. Jack and Christian, his father, talk about forgiveness and about everything leading up to that point. It's easy to see how much during that point that they love each other and how that even though they've been through a lot all that matters now is the forgiveness. That's the kind of relationship that I hope to have with God. I would love one day to get to heaven and have my heavenly father say that nothing else matters now without saying a word. So in conclusion, from a Christian point of view I can honestly say that I really enjoyed this TV show. I would also hope that the next time you watch the show that you should definitely keep your eyes open for the little things. The subtle little hints that God is present everywhere. =)
B003F3NE1Q|5.0|Season 6 lives up to the usual drama we're all used to with Grey's.  Maybe not quite as many tears as season 5, although I reckon the first episode of 6 will make you cry enough for the rest of the episodes!  It's quite funny in places and it's good to see other characters getting a look in as Meredith and Dereks relationship takes a back seat as they start to settle down.  A token appearance by Addison made me happy as she's one of my favourite characters!  A must see if you're a fan of the series, let's just hope season 7 is just as good :)

It is not only a cookbook, but educational.  Want to know the differences in sugars?  Milks? How to replace chicken eggs in baked goods? This book will help you become more confident in Vegan baking.  Colleen has an amazing podcast called \\"Vegetarian food for thought\\" that is a great companion to all of her amazing cookbooks!
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I have watched this movie for the sixth time and love it more and more each time i see it. I do not believe this was a few camera put together documentary as stated in the beginging of this film. This was a full feature film directed by the man himself and shows his brillance beyond words. Body doubles are used, but I don't care(Sorry Kenny). Big things are coming ahead for mj, as Jermaine said \\"This is not it\\"

B004HWR406|1.0|I was so dissapointed in this movie. The subject was interesting enough, and I wanted to see it after hearing all the hype about it.  It was so boring!  I could have cut the movie in half and then the wit of the writing would have been much more evident.   A few scenes were great - the twins in the Harvard President's Office, the sculling race...but the rest was too long and boring.

B004LRZ2YC|5.0|This was an absolutely great flick. We all like to see the bad gus get it in the end, and this flick does not disappoint.    The most intriguing aspect however is the mix of innocence and evil.  There's young love with out the over the top sexual back drop.    I could say much more but I think it will be better if you watch it for yourself. It will leave you spell bound. And I think I need to watch it again, right now.

B0044XV3R8|4.0|I love the movie and I wanted the collector's edition for the special features. It's really neat that they have all three versions of the movie (original theatrical release, the re-release, and the directors cut) HOWEVER, they put all three versions on 2 discs so half way through the movie (whichever version you are watching) you have to get up and switch to the second disc. I don't understand why they did this... it's a pain in the butt. The special features are on the third disc which are fantastic. Great DVD package to have, but just be warned that if you are going to watch any of the versions of the movie, be prepared to be interrupted halfway through to switch discs.
B003Y5H4SO|4.0|I liked this movie.  It has an interesting plot; a competent cast; creepy atmosphere; and a M. Night twist ending.  My only disappointment is its final scene, but I understand the writer's intent.<br />It's far better than Night's other disasters--SIXTH SENSE excluded.  Spook fans should enjoy.

B00169N0BK|3.0|I use this unit to calibrate 17 laptops, and another 10 or so desktops several times a year. It works great it is fast. It is accurate. However, it is not easy to physically use. Every time I touch it in any way I am hitting a button or setting something on it I don't want to.<br />That is my only major complaint. The smaller complaint is I have had some issues running the updater software so I just don't.<br />-Michael
B004B32532|5.0|my favourite movie finally on blu ray!!!!  must be seen to be believed it encampasess many genre's  unforgetable and undeniably great this movie leaves me speechless  not for everyone only those with some intellect and an open mind   you will either love it or hate it......
B003EYVXUU|4.0|The prevailing feeling that comes from this film is not one of horror (though that it there too) but of utter despair and sadness.  The two main characters, but in particular Owen, are extremely sad and isoloated.  The scene where Owen is on the phone with his dad is so beautifully written, directed and especially acted by Kodi Smit Mcphee, that you might find yourself wiping tears from your eyes. This movie is very slow moving, but this is deliberate as it builds this overwhelming feeling of dread that becomes almost unbearable.  Part of it is because you care so much about these characters but part of it is because there is a realism about the whole thing that makes the movie that much more powerful.  No sparkly vampires here!   But again, you can't walk away from this film without having the utmost respect for the creators and especially the two young actors.  Powerful, moving, gruesome, sometimes painful to watch, but ultimately a very satisfying movie (be warned; it aint the FEEL GOOD movie of the year).
B003L20IFQ|5.0|My favorite part was his last conversation with the agency that was his employer, which sent him to Iraq. I'm a contractor for a very big, well-known company, and I work through an agency, too, as most of us do. That's about the way it would go.<br /><br />So there was more to this -- political and social commentary -- than just the terrible situation, and it seemed realistic. Held my attention closely, and it's worth watching and paying close attention to what happens and what is said.

159102594X|4.0|I loved The Blade Itself.  It's a tremendous debut for Abercrombie.  Buy it.  Read it.  Laugh with it.  you won't regret it... if you enjoy adult fantasy along the lines of GRRM.  If you have problems with violence and language, stay away.  There's plenty of both.  No overt sex scenes though.      If you're like me, waiting for GRRM to hurry up with the next book in his series, you couldn't choose a better author than Abercrombie to pass the time.  His tales aren't as epic as Martin's, but his characters are similar, in that they aren't all bad or all good.  Most are very gray.  Glokta reminds me a lot of Tyrion Lannister.    Beware, TBI is very light on plot.  Most is setting up for the next books.  However, it's the characters that make a good story anyway, and each POV character is enjoyable to spend time with.  My favorite scene in the book was the last Logan chapter in part one... it was some of the most truthful writing I've read in a long time.  Thanks Joe, I'm already on to book two!
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|This is the CIA's version of Space Cowboys. You have a group of old, retired agents who are thrust back into action in order to solve a conspiracy.    Red stands for Retired, Extremely Dangerous. It stars a stellar cast of greats: Bruce Willis, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, Karl Urban and Morgan Freeman.    Bruce Willis is a lonely ex-agent who finds himself in the cross-hairs of a special wet team. Wanting help, he grabs his old team, Malkovich, Mirren and Freeman, in order to discover who wants them killed and why.    Karl Urban plays the CIA agent in charge of their disposal.    There are some wonderful action moments and John Malkovich is as funny as ever. He is the best part of this movie by far.    I felt jilted by the Morgan Freeman character - or at least how his character was dealt with.    It almost feels like watching the 80s version of Bruce Willis and his movies of that decade where there's serious explosions with a high mix of laughs while they don't quite take themselves seriously.    This is a terrific movie to rent for a weekend.
B002VPE1PW|3.0|My ASUS Eee PC is a 10.1\\" netbook. This sleeve was listed as being for 7\\" to 10\\" netbooks, but let me tell you: My 10.1\\" netbook was swimming in this case. There was way too much room inside, and it seems more like it's fitted to an 11\\" netbook, or one slightly bigger than that.<br /><br />Construction-wise, it's a nice case, but it's WAY too loose for an Eee PC 10.1\\" netbook. I wouldn't trust it simply because it doesn't seem any more secure than just throwing my netbook into a sack. The straps are meant to hook around the corners, but it's too big to fit snugly, and the netbook just kind of slides around inside this sleeve.<br /><br />I appreciate the effort, but they need to change the product title. I don't see any way this is a good fit for a 10\\" netbook, and I really can't imagine putting a 7\\" device inside this sleeve. It's just too darned big for things of those sizes. It might fit a 10\\" netbook if the netbook is really thick, but I can't imagine that being common enough to warrant selling this as a 10\\" netbook case.<br /><br />Maybe it's really just meant for the Kindle DX, and if your netbook happens to fit, that's nice too.<br /><br />Anyway, if you have an ASUS Eee PC 10.1\\" netbook, avoid this. It's not tight enough to give any real protection.<br /><br />Five stars for quality, but minus two stars for poor marketing on this item.
B000UJ48SQ|4.0|I remember seeing this film for the first time and being blown away by the music and actually this film was responsisble for my initial interest in classical music in a lot of ways.  I just watched it again recently and what struck me was Ryan O'Niel and he never really had another great part in his career.      But besides all that, this film is a total tour de force and probably the best film ever made on life and times in the 18th Century.
B000002WNP|5.0|Unlike the 50s box set, the 60s does not include his movie songs, and also his live albums and specials are not included. Of course you probably don't need his movie songs or live albums as you can find those in separate box sets dedicated to Elvis's movie career and live albums. Still it is a little upsetting to see songs like Return to Sender or Viva Las Vegas excluded for that reason. It contains all his singles and studio album songs of the 60s, which was the most in Elvis' career and the only full decade which he recorded. The sound quality is slightly better than the 50s set and a few rare alternate takes and live performances on the final disc. Overall a must own for Elvis fans.
B002ZG980U|2.0|This was a decent movie but my problem was mostly with the performances.  Most of the stars of this movie are from the younger generation and while they no doubt have the intensity down, there seems to be a certain lack of creativity and inventiveness in the performances.  It's something one can't always put their fingure on but I used to example of the film The Departed.  Now compare Jack Nicholson's performance with Leonardi DiCaprio's.  DiCaprio no doubt has the intensity down and knows how to find the \\"correct\\" emotion with which to deliver a line, as he does in Inception, but the \\"correct\\" emotion isn't always the most interesting or exciting.  As much as I love Ellen Page and as much as I respect the people involved in this film, the performances left it far too grey and drab.  I will say that the second half is much better than the first so I'm glad I didn't leave half way through like I wanted to.  Although, dreams have been explored in a number of other films much more effectively and there is nothing new here.  See David Lynch for better films on the subject.
B003EYVXUU|5.0|This film's rating on Amazon is being skewed by people unfairly. If you don't believe me then read the 1 star reviews. One person admits in the first line of their 'review' that \\"this is not a bad movie\\". Another person admits to having never even seen it ! All the 1 star reviews are biased because the film is a remake of a foreign film they loved. They are not reviewing this film only the hypothetical idea of remakes in general.    This film was not perfect but it was darn near it. If I could change one thing I would have changed the way they handled Eli's movements in some portions of the film. I personally didn't like how fast and jittery she looked when she 'fanged out'. Other than that it was perfect. And far better than the original in my opinion. Please watch it yourself and make up your own mind. And do watch the original because it is a fine movie.
B00005QGAV|5.0|I think this is one of the best CD's that Michael had produced, I like this one a little better than Thriller, so much more should have been done with this album just as the Thriller CD, great songs on this one, very easy on the ears.
B000SQKZKG|2.0|In the 70's, ELP was an entertaining live act. When they were with their 80 piece orchestra, double size drum kits and flaming/ wobbling pianos, those 30 minute instrumental solos seemed great.<br /><br />Without the visual, that same music is very boring and lacks the \\"punch\\". ELP is no \\"jam band\\" so the 3 minute radio version of \\"Karn Evil 9\\" blows away the endless 30 minute live version. The Greg Lake works (Lucky Man, Still... you turn me on) are much better in their recorded form.<br /><br />Only \\"hoedown\\" generates enough energy to make it interesting.<br /><br />I'm not saying this is bad but a 3 record live ELP work represents the good, but also the bad of the band.

B000001FS3|5.0|There are great albums, 5 star works and then there are masterpieces that transcend the normal manner to judge albums. Like iconic albums such as \\"Revolver\\", \\"Who's Next\\",\\"Blonde on Blonde\\",  \\"Sticky Fingers\\", \\"Led Zeppelin II\\", \\"Thriller\\", and \\"Born in the USA\\" , \\"The Joshua Tree\\" is among the most important albums that emerged from the 1980's. It's so significant that I associate it as a soundtrack with historical points in my life.<br /><br />There are no highlights since the work is made up of all entirely terrific songs. A highlight would mean which magnificent song affected YOU the most.<br /><br />Between the amazing production, the drama and emotion, the anthemic nature of some of these tunes or the exsquisite pacing of the album, this is an important work of art as good as anything that has been put out there. Some of these songs have been used so impassionately, that it is impossible to seperate the music from the visuals (i.e. the unraveling of 9/11 victims while singing \\"where the streets have no name\\")<br /><br />This is what catapulted U2 into being giants in their field. I cannot really think of any other artist that accomplished so much merely on the power of a recording (as opposed to today's artists that are largely created by media and hype)
B004KPQK2S|5.0|This is a movie that will keep you on your seat. It is a real heart to heart movie! Something that is hard to find these days. The acting was awesome.

B0009XT8YW|5.0|Sometime ago, Sony started embeding code onto their recorded CD's so they wouldn't play in most computers. Their thinking was so that illegal copies couldn't be reproduced and sold mass black market. But consumers became upset because they couldn't burn their own personal copies to protect the original. Well things are different now. No doubt because of the bad press and consumer outrage, they reluctantly agreed to give out the code so newer computers could recognize the CD which would allow consumers to burn and rip their tunes to portable devices. If you have an older computer I believe you can download a patch that will allow you to burn and rip your CD. Now that that's out of the way. Barbra Streisands Guilty! What can I say exept 5 STARS! I can't believe it's been 31 years since it came out. After all these years it's like fine Wine. It get's better and better with age. We were newly married with our baby girl and Guilty would play for hours on end. My daughter would sometimes become irritated when the record stopped. (Yes, Guilty originally came out in LP and tape form. No CD's yet). We would have to keep it playing to make her happy. How crazy was that? Go and purchase this dual-disc version of Guilty and don't worry about playback issues. It's been taken care of. It's been Remastered and sounds phenomenal. Better than the album. No cracks or having to turn over the album. Looking at the original artwork from the CD liner, I can't help but think that Barry would have made a fantastic looking Jesus in a movie about his life on Earth. He was and still is so handsome. What a great album. It's timeless. Go and get it now!

1932100660|5.0|This book offers compelling facts about the relationship between nutrition and some diseases that are very common in the United states: various types of cancers, heart disease and strokes, obesity and related conditions, Alzheimers, etc.  The evidence presented shows a strong correlation between the kind of food we eat and the incidence of these diseases.  The correlations are so strong that one has to also infer that there is a strong causal relationship between diet and disease.  I have never had a doctor give me the information about diet that is in this book, and there are compelling reasons why that is true.  Those reasons have to do with powerful vested interests in the food industry, and its infrastructure which supplies the retail stores, restaurants, etc.  Animal fat and protein are the centerpieces of the American diet, and we pay a huge and unnecessary price for this, with most of us not having a clue what we are doing to ourselves when we are eating.  This book should be required reading for anyone who cares about maintaining good health.   Keith Longberg

B003UESJH4|5.0|Top 10 Movies of 2010 - seems like Hollywood or the Academy got it right for a change!<br /><br />An old-fashioned  movie of quality. Albert, Bertie (Colin Firth) is Prince of York, second in line to the British crown and his suave brother, Edward the Prince of Wales is first. Bertie is shy, retiring and a bit priggish and definitely repressed.  Both the King, George V and the Prince of Wales make fun of Bertie for his awful embarrassing stutter. But that's OK, the King is on the throne and the Prince of Wales stands ready to take over the reins of government in the future, and Bertie can stay far in the background, away from the public eye, and ear! Bertie seeks the help of speech therapists, many of them, lastly Lionel Logue, played by Geoffrey Rush.  But wait, Hitler is rising to power and is taking over Europe, the King is deadly sick and the Prince of Wales is a drunken playboy, in love with Wallis Simpson, an American divorcee of dubious character who is also fooling around with various Germans and Edward is a crypto-Fascist, who is in sympathy with Hitler! Rulership of the United Kingdom and stewardship of the Free World during World War II is soon to be thrust on the unlikely shoulders of shy stuttering Bertie. Logue recognizes the psychological origins or Bertie's problem applies unconventional therapies.<br /><br /> Helena Bonham Carter plays the role of the woman who would become the current Queen Mother (!)<br /><br />  Ultimately, The Kings Speech is a vague kind of buddy movie, but one unlike any other. The roles and sympathy the actors, Firth, Rush and Carter come to share for each other is the hallmark.<br /><br /> There was a time when the film industry produced many films each year with the superb quality of acting and meaningful plot in the Kings Speech. Now they are a rarity and we have mostly trash designed to appeal to 12 year olds. Here is a movie without car chases and super heroes, but real acting. Firth seems as if he has had that stutter all his life, he is so convincing.<br /><br /> Some of the audience stood up and cheered and applauded at the end, it's that good.<br /><br />Now that WWII is over, it's conclusion seems predestined. But if England had fallen and America was trying to land, not in Normandy but in Ireland, the whole world might be speaking German now and celebrating the 1000 year Reich.ncing.

1440503257|3.0|I bought my girlfriend this book because she's a chef and she loves Harry Potter. She liked it well enough, but didn't seem to really understand what most of the recipes had to do with the books. There was one sort of funny comment about the Weasleys not explicitly being called Irish in the novels, but being Irish all the same. It was something like, \\"J.K. never comes right out and tells you, but they've got red hair, freckles, a bunch of kids, and you know...\\" If I was Irish, I might be offended after reading such a blatant stereotype, but, as I'm not, it gave me a chuckle to see that some editor somewhere let this slip by AND that it appears as part of the description of more than one recipe. Anyway, I don't necessarily recommend this one unless you're interested in old recipes from the United Kingdom. It doesn't have much to do with Harry Potter and some of the recipes call for sheep brains. I'm not squeamish, but Harry Potter themed sheep brains just isn't my idea of a good time. Alas.

1608870081|4.0|I was unable to give this item five stars not because of any complaint specific to this product, but instead because of a complaint I have when it comes to all pop-up books. They break too easily. The book itself is full of excellent artwork and would probably make a good gift for a child you want to get into reading, but make sure you supervise while they're turning the pages or it will get destroyed. I gave the copy I bought to my girlfriend, a huge Harry Potter fan who loves most Harry Potter related stuff, and she loved it, but one of the tabs on the dragon page (the best page in the book in my opinion) snapped after she had looked through it only two or three times and she was handling it with care. Now the dragon has a wonky wing. So... Call it a grain of salt? Don't get me wrong, this book is very cool. However, it is delicate. So be warned.
B000U7169M|3.0|this was a pretty, fairly good movie, sticking to regular formula of the typical excoricism-ish appeal.    CONCLUSION:  if you have time to kill i would definately recommend buying/renting it for the price, you can't go wrong.

I got it because I thought it would put our more bass to my Sennheiser HD595 Dynamic High-Grade Premiere Headphones but it just didn't really make a difference in the sound or bass.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I wanna start off by saying I was a little kid when Daria originally aired on mtv (when is was actually music television) so I didn't really get the humor back then but I remember still liking it.<br />Anyway I was flipping through the best buy catalog when I saw \\"Daria The complete animated series\\" and I got so excited to see mtv FINALLY listening to the fans. I got it the day it came out  and I'm glad I did!<br />Its not hard to see why it has such a cult following. Most shows and movies considered funny these days are either bathroom humor (think scary movie series) or sexual humor which has been way overdone.<br />Well that's surely not that case with Daria! Its clever, intelligent humor that actually makes you think. The one liners from both daria and Jane are so clever and its funny to see when they totally go over the other characters heads. Thats also where I see a minor flaw in the show.<br />The popular kids and even some adults are a little too stupid, for instance kevin and britney. I know they were just trying to contrast them from Daria and Jane but even so some things that say and do just aren't realistic ( unless they are \\"special\\" if you know what I mean).<br />Another thing I kinda didn't like was and the end of season 4/ beginning of season five Daria gets a boyfriend. For me giving Daria a boyfriend (not to mention she stole him from Jane) just didn't fit her outsider persona. I'm glad they didn't focus on their relationship that much. I know many fans will probably get mad at me for saying anything bad about about Daria but even if you're a fan of something it doesn't mean you love everything about it. I still think the show is an all time classic and one of the best animated series EVER so don't get me wrong. Shes the hero for all the people who felt like outcasts in school or even in life in general.

If you enjoyed On an Island, you will love it even more live.<br /><br />Biggest selling point: You get Echoes played live in its entirety!!! And guess what? It sounds even better than it did on Meddle.<br /><br />Go out and buy this album and let the greatest guitarist in rock history take you on a trip.

B000006TRV|5.0|No need for me to write a full review of this album. It is a masterpiece and my absolute favorite album of all time. It never gets old. If you don't own it, you can't call yourself a fan of rock music. PERIOD. Greatest album ever made.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|I've been listening to everything since funky Rick James, to sweet but vindictive Taylor Swift.  I have embraced Euro industrial and electronica, pop/neuvo-disco in American musik for the last few years.  I have to say Linkin Park has been a life saver.  I was taken in by Gaga, entranced by Nirvana, but the ones who touched my heart and brought me out of the darkness were Linkin Park.  MTM is definitely the next chapter in their progression.  How people can complain or doubt, I can understand.  If you like/love a group and their albums, you hope the next will be a continuation of the former.  But groups want to grow, experiment, evolve.  They are getting older and have amazing new experiences that are represented in their music. MTM seems as good or better than  Meteoria or Hybrid Theory the more I listen.  Yes my initial reaction was along the lines of \\"uh, this isn't the same.  Do I like it?\\"  Geez, Chester obviously throws his heart soul and guts into everything when he's singing, whether rockin' or reflective ballading. I thought Mike's influence was lacking at first, but man he is there in bounds.  I really think it was great for Mike to record with Fort Minor.  Gave him opportunity to express himself and let go of what's deep inside.  REANIMATION also allowed alternate expressions with guest rappers to add dimension to the emotion and expression of the songs.  Then MTM.  It's the expression of a maturing group.  No, not every song needs a rap, as Chester soulfully expresses the immensity of feeling and throbbing of the heart in his lyrics.  Then he explodes, and it just hits your soul like a tsumnami. Meanwhile Mike is throwing a heartful, killer rhyme from the heart out there.  LP always has hope in the end of their songs. Yeah life is a killer and takes us for all we're worth, but we try to evolve from what we were to something useful and have hope for the future.  I'm a pessimist or a realist, as you look at it, so I relate to the disappointment, fear, andlack of understanding in LP.  This album just continues the feelings of rejection, fear, but hope of resilience and acceptance in a hard world.  I think this is why LP still is relevant to their fans.  So many artists lose their edge as they age and make big money, but LP seems to see the real people.  MTM might be different than previous albums, but the more you listen, the more small touches or amazing lyricism shows through.  Yeah, give it a chance through quite a few listenings.  I don't think you pick it all up the first few times and have to make a judgment after familiarity as it surrounds you, before you can make a fair analysis. I think they still understand how it feels to be one of \\"us\\".
B000002U82|5.0|The title of my review says it all. This is the only album that I've ever heard that I consider to be perfect. This album stands the test of time and will live forever. Hundreds of years from now, people will be listening to this masterpiece. You've heard it, you most likely have owned a copy. This was Pink Floyd at its finest. One of the few times during their career that EVERYONE was on the same page. They truly created something wonderful. 43 minutes of musical bliss.<br /><br />You should already own this.
B004BJMEO6|5.0|Elena Undone.Yes this film has lesbian aka woman love subject matter in it,but it's a universal love story. With heart,and deals with relationships in general,family,faith and work.A story about soul mates.The film was shot so beautifully.It's a great film.It makes Herstory with the longest screen kiss in cinema.The lead actresses did an amazing job.Traci Dinwiddie nailed the role of Peyton.She is very easy to watch,and giving as an actor.She reminds me of Lauren Bacall. \\"Just put your lips together and blow\\".She has natural spunk,fire,and sexuality and you can't help but be drawn to her,mezmorized by her.She can carry a whole room with those eyes.Talent is rather abundant with her.Ever clear with the orgasm scene,this was the most believable one I have ever seen.How brave to be that free,and it's beautiful.The way she played on the subtle verge of tears,bravo sister.Many of us have felt this,and now we can see it on film thanks to you.And Necar Zadegan totally embodied Elena.Necar is stunning visually and quite obviously has acting prowess.She can do dramatic,make you feel emotions.Quite rare when you believe an actor is feeling rather than acting,and she does this.I really felt she went on this journey.And maybe the actress herself felt she did while making this film.But she did a super job.Going from a closed off reserved robot,to a free,open,confident woman.She made me feel her every emotion.The chemistry is so hot it pops off the screen.You almost feel the two actors are falling in love.That's talent.We need more films out there that show this kind of passion.The cast,the crew,the director,I don't think a single person involved in this film didn't give it their all.What a job by everyone.Thank you so much for the art.Please keep films like this coming.Blessings of love and light to everyone.Watch the film.Share the love.
0920668364|2.0|I didn't love this book.  I find it a little odd, the mother carrying around a grown man???  Maybe after a few readings I'll like it better but the overall theme of the book was a little much for me.
B004132HZS|5.0|Great plot, great acting and GREAT story lines - especially in the 3rd episode.<br />So Very Much worth purchasing this 3 episode set.

1594202842|3.0|I read this book yesterday in one sitting. As a young mother I found it fascinating and thought provoking, which is what I like in a book. I didn't read it expecting to agree with everything and I didn't. At the same time, I found some strengths to her approach and wondered if they would be worth applying. I also didn't finish the book hating or disliking her, and was surprised by the extent of the anger toward her, although that's easier to understand regarding those who have only read the newspaper account. In fact, after all the hype I'd heard, I'd expected to HATE the book and found it was different than I'd expected.    Still, a few problems with her outlook in general:  - She defines success too narrowly, in terms of jobs that earn high salary and have prestige.  - She seems to be out of touch with the lifestyle of those who have much more moderate incomes and living styles. For instance, she works long hours at a high stress job and also spends countless hours with her children practicing musical instruments. I wonder, then, if a maid and hired help take care of her house and cook their meals? Otherwise, when does she have time for this? While she states that her parents stayed at Motel 6's and the like, she takes her children to fancy hotels. I would consider a person more successful who realizes success does not equal material flamboyance and chooses to live frugally and uses extra money to help others. I would have liked to see more emphasis in her parenting on using talents to serve others, not only to obtain greater personal opportunity. In addition, I felt many of the \\"opportunities\\" she did give her children were possible because of the combined salaries of two law professor parents.    And a few things I was impressed by:  - She values her family greatly and spending time with them. She mentions she and her husband took her children on every vacation they went on and they took their child all over the place. I don't care if a family only goes campingdown the street, but I admire her family's commitment to togetherness and think that will benefit her children. In addition, I admire her decision to let her mother-in-law live with the family and to take care of her when sick, despite concerns over different parenting styles. Of course, that was made much easier since she could afford to pay a nurse to help, but still I admire her devotion to her extended family and believe that choice will have a positive impact on her daughters. In addition, although she may have been overly negative, I also admire all the time she spent with her daughters while they practiced. Yes, she may have overdone it, but I still think her willingness to work with them was a strength.   - She actually says she lets one of her daughters go on a sleep over and her daughter didn't enjoy it as the girls were gossipy and one talked of sexual exploits (if I recall correctly). Sleepovers are not a prerequisite of a happy childhood. Instead, her daughters were busy with positive activities that helped them build a positive self-esteem and I find that a strength.  - I value that she pushes her daughters to achieve excellence. Still on the idea of piano and violin study, I think it admirable that developing her daughters' talents was such a high priority, worth investing both her time and money. I think it was my parents' encouragement and high expectations for me that helped me have a higher vision for myself in school and life. At the same time, my parents also taught that talents and money both come with important obligations to be used to serve other people, which I feel were important. In addition, time with family was more important than money.    Ultimately, I think she's playing on Western fears and fascination with China as a growing world power, amidst news reports of American students falling behind in testing, and using that to market her book. It worked. She puts people off, understandably, by comparing one culture to another and stating the superiority of one mothering style to another -- or at least that's how it sounds in the title. But, if you give the title a second read, you can also take it as her saying that is what she started off thinking, but that as she went along she was humbled by the experiences of motherhood and ended up learning something else. For instance, at the beginning of the book she expresses a Chinese belief that parents are not there to learn from her children (if I recall correctly), but later on she starts admitting ways in which she has learned from her children and admitting that not all of her \\"Chinese\\" parenting styles worked.    Another thing to consider: Those who leave a culture whether that be China, England or Mexico and live in a community for some time removed from that culture, tend to have more conservative, strict, notions of what that culture stands for. This makes sense because while the culture they left behind continues evolving, their connection to it stays the same, and often in an attempt to hold to that culture they'll in many ways be holding to a past notion or their own created understanding of it. This is not bad or good, necessarily, but is true. Thus, I believe, is the root of her understanding of Chinese motherhood, although she does admit at the beginning that not all Chinese mothers are the same and that not all Western parents are either.    I think she is reacting against many of the very real problems we have in American culture with drop-outs, drugs and drifters. Also, remember that at the end of the book she credits many of the Founding Fathers as being very like Chinese mothers. (I found this a little ironic as they exemplified the values of Western Protestantism.) She also expresses her gratitude to live in the U.S. and enjoy all the opportunities she has here. I think what she's trying to get at is a work ethic. What she may have missed is that play for children, in my opinion, is work. Still, she makes the point that work can become play and I think in many ways that became true for her daughters and I've seen that in my own life as well.    I don't see her, generally, as abusing her children. Sure, I try to praise my daughter and I'm generous with that praise, but I think she says that she does that in private. What she says is that a \\"Chinese mother\\" doesn't praise her children in public. And yes, she's sometimes very critical, but I think she's also very loving. No parents are perfect and she certainly is not. As a mother, reading her book made me want to spend more time with my daughter helping her develop her talents. Her book may be overstated, but it's in response to an American culture with extreme emphasis on \\"fun\\" and less on \\"work\\" on one hand, although admittedly too much competitiveness in many circles (including hers, apparently).     All in all, I enjoyed the book and will enjoy discussing it at my next book club meeting.
0393037010|5.0|When I saw the Russell Crowe movie based on this book series, I enjoyed the historical setting and engaging plot, but I was most intrigued by the friendship of the characters Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin. It was this relationship and its development that elevated the movie from good entertainment to something that addresses the human condition. That's why I picked up the first book in the series, and I was not disappointed. In fact, I was overjoyed to find that the movie had not led me astray.    For all the seafaring lingo and historical accuracy, these are books about friendship. They elucidate our human need for engagement with and affection/affirmation from peers. They also examine the challenges, conflicts and dilemmas that result. For this reason alone I am overjoyed to have 15 more books in the series to read. But beyond the friendship thematics, these are beautifully written books that transport the reader to a world that has been lost since the age of the steamship: the world of canvas, timber and rope where the science of harnessing the wind ruled the fates of nations.    I recommend the companion book [[ASIN:0805066152 A Sea of Words, Third Edition: A Lexicon and Companion to the Complete Seafaring Tales of Patrick O'Brian]] for help with decyphering obscure terminology and historical intricacies.
0786868724|4.0|Loved this book by Mitch.  Not as good as Tuesdays with Maury, or Five people you meet in heaven.  But, a book well worth the read.
1601251505|5.0|With all the new feats and optional class features for every class, there is little need to opt for prestige classes.  You can customize your characters better with this beautiful tome.  The art of Wayne Reynolds is in top form in the classes section (Check out the sexy exotic sorceress).  I love this book!
0385341008|4.0|Was drawn initially to this book by it's unusual title. Familiar with the Guernsey Islands, but did not know much about their culture and heritage.<br />This book was fast reading, interesting, and always left me anxious to resume (after a break) to find out what was happening in the lives of these colorful characters in those troubled times.
B00082IJ08|5.0|I got this CD quickly, and I simply love it. the title says it all. Not much more I can say. Thanks!
0345528581|5.0|I am 66 a year old woman and am trying to do bone strenthening exercises. I also want to get firmness, which has left me at this age!  I have read Al Sear's book on P.A.C.E and have found it very helpful.  But I have struggled with doing strength training at home.  This book, You are Your Own Gym is the help I needed.  Also all the preliminary information was valuable.  I even llked his pep talks.  I am so glad I bought this book!
B004L3AR0K|5.0|I was very surprised to find this movie to my liking. I went (rather grudgingly I'll admit) to see this movie and I was blown away, it wasn't just a comedy, it wasn't just a romance, it was a deep, intricate experience that mirrors (to the best of hollywood's ability) the real relational component that we never really know what will come next with any of our relationships. This movie throws you for several unexpected twists and turns but this is one not to miss! Do be warned it's rated R for a reason, you see just about everything Hathaway and Gyllenhaal have to offer. This movie also packs some pretty good comic value. Ultimately its a heartwarming story about a man who had never found a desire to approach anything with all of his heart and/or ability until he meets Maggie, then everything changes. This will definitely be added to my personal collection just as soon as it comes on DVD.
B00129H7VS|5.0|I ordered the Band of Brothers Blu-ray Box set... EPIC. This thing was in damn near perfect condition. Had it been wrapped in plastic, I would have believed it was brand new.
B0031ES8P6|2.0|i bought this to find out its only three dollars at my local stores here the same thing well made my niece loved it is all i can say.
0823095223|5.0|Wow, I have spent countless hours trying to learn as much as possible about this industry and trying to complete some good works.  This book blows all of my knowledge out of the water.  It should be noted that in order to really \\"follow along\\" with the project presented in the book you will need A LOT of supplies.  pressure pot, compressor, wax pen, camping stove, rubber mold materials, resins, the list goes on but all of it is required to get the job done.  A very daunting task indeed.    The book is very well written with lots of witty comments and animations.  I have only had it for 2 days and am nearly done with it because I love to read it so much.  It makes the process seem much easier than it is and encourages me to spend more time in the studio.  My only gripe would be that their is a lot of editing issues, missing words, odd image references est but its no biggy.  The pictures are as a whole very good with only a few blurry spots here and there.  It is certainly a must buy for anyone interested in the industry of Toys.
B000PY52EU|4.0|One of the greatest movies you've never seen.  It suffered from incredibly bad marketing (and an incredibly challenging film to market).  This film is much more about faith, love, and redemption, than it is about sex and violence. (but be warned, sex and violence are present in large measure)    This is an actors movie, and it delivers some of the most mesmerizing performances I've ever seen.    Samuel Jackson: Possibly his most intense role ever, certainly his most intense since Pulp Fiction. He is at his most tortured, most complex best. As a bonus, he learned how to play blues guitar for this film, and is surprisingly good.    Christina Ricci:  A career performance.  One of the darkest, most disturbing female leads ever.  The fact that she wasn't nominated for an Oscar, Golden Globe, People's Choice, etc is a damned crime. This is up there with \\"All About Eve\\", \\"Monster\\", and \\"Thelma And Louise\\".  She is incendiary, bold, honest, fearless, raw, etc, etc.    Justin Timberlake is surprisingly effective as a young soldier who is shattered and broken.    S. Epatha Merkerson is her usual brilliant self in an unfortunately small role.    Craig Brewer's writing and direction is occasionally uneven, but it delivers so many phenomenal scenes makes it easy to forgive.    Overall, for a small, overlooked film, I cannot recommend this strongly enough.  It is brilliant, eminently re-watchable, and one of those rare films that make you re-think the possibilities of cinema.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|One of the most interesting and engaging books i have ever read. It gave me a few heart attacks along the way, but is well worth reading.
B004APVI1G|5.0|A friend of mine said the visual geek factor in this movie is worth getting past the story line.  Well I agree with him, but not on both parts.  The visuals are indeed phenomenal.  The feathers, the flying, the slow motion, the movement of the owls and bats, the snakeskin, the eyes.. Just WOW!  I watched it four times in two days with my kid.  Kids loves the story and I found it good.  Yeah they kinds sped up events in it, but kids will not even notice that.  I am still stunned at the computer animation craftsmanship in this movie.  They have owl movements down pat for me with what I recall seeing Owl move in real life and on nature shows.  I also watched it in 3D.  Looks even better.  I am not sure about any great pop-out moments, I still soaking in the textures in this movie.  Voices are great as well.  Sound is great.  Character expressions great.  Wish I saw it in the theater on the super big screen!
B002ZG97RE|3.0|My review for this item is to be taken from only one person's point of view and not as a whole. I really think this movie has a large political value. If it doesn't scream 'I hate Bush'. Nothing does. This movie is nothing more than a cheap way to make pop shots on behalf of the liberal media and liberal agenda. You may personally agree or disagree with the war in Iraq, but to make a movie about how the war was a lie and we are killing thousands of civilians everyday...I mean come on. Personally, I think the movie is pretty anti-american, anti-republican, and anti-Bush.    Outside of the political movement...the movie was filled with action. Similar to Borne Identity. Good fight scenes, good action. It is enough to keep your eyes on the TV at least! But the movie isn't like anything you haven't seen before. So with that being said...I give it 3 stars or originality.
0061726826|2.0|Delirium has a fantastic dystopian premise. What if love was considered a disease that could be vaccinated for? What would life be like for people in a love-free society? The concept was so full of potential, but the story inevitably got bogged down in the romance.<br /><br />Lena isn't eighteen and hasn't been cured yet. This makes her still susceptible to love. She meets a boy and falls in love, causing her to be considered infected and much like a criminal. The problem I have with the relationship is that it is so convenient. Minors aren't allowed to spend time with uncureds of the opposite sex, so Lena predictably falls in love with the first one she talks to. The relationship continues with both of them falling deeper in love to the point where they are willing to give up everything to be together. It's very romantic. And stupid. Especially since they've known each other for about two months.<br /><br />Is the love story in Delirium realistic in the society of the book? Sure, but it's also unbelievably annoying. I'm usually all for rebelling against dystopian society, but the argument against love in Delirium is rather convincing. Love is messy. It can make you seriously ill and possibly homicidal or suicidal. Can you really fault a government for trying to find a solution. The cure seems to be working, society is benefiting, and no one is complaining. Lena was excited to receive the cure until a boy paid her the slightest bit of attention. She acts in the exact way the society warns people about, yet we're supposed to see them as the villains.<br /><br />I was disappointed with Delirium. The concept was promising, the hype was huge and other reviewers seem to absolutely love it. Yet, I just could not fathom someone throwing away a good future in the name of love. Or, more accurately, in the name of infatuation and lust given the length and super sexy secret nature of the relationship. When I wish for the dystopian society to win, I know something has gone horribly wrong with a story.
B001VNB54A|5.0|This is a very good film.I didn't realise that it was based on a true story before I purchased it.I think movies like this have more meaning for people who have been in the military and especially war veterans.Anyone who has been in the military will enjoy this film whether in Blu-ray or regular film.the metal case the Blu-ray comes in is artfully decorated which makes the entire package a collectors item.
1559408855|4.0|Probably a little bit of both.After I watched this movie for the first time, my first impulse was to throw it in the trash.A few days later I watched the documentary where Passolini says you must view this film from the perspective of an artist.He also appears to be a gentle, quiet, soft spoken type, that may well be far ahead of his time.When I started watching the film from the perspective of an artist, I discovered that every frame of the film is artfully crafted to have the absolute maximum emotional impact.From that point of view, you could even say its a masterpiece!And the message Passolini is trying to convey; how absolute power can corrupt a group of individuals into totally dropping out of the human race, is unforgettable.I cannot erase those images from my memory.I believe this may also be a portrait of the darkest side of each of our own selves.And that those who object the loudest to this film are probably seeing themselves and cannot accept it.The sadism of the last chapter is when those who drop out of the human race become totally bored with everything around them and every second seems to last an eternity.I know because I have been there.So this film is definitely not for the faint of heart, but it is a graphic study in human degeneration when given total power over others.One problem however is the portrayal of homosexuals as being insensetive and brutal in a lawless sexual situation.I have witnessed sexual lawlessness, and it was not the homosexuals but the heterosexuals that were the most brutal and insensitive.I give therefore 4 stars.  (Unless Eli Roth or Quentin Tarantino were to do a remake or sequel, in which case it would definitely be 5 stars)
0340837748|4.0|My Sister's Keeper is written so carefully and so vividly.  I was there in person with every word and sentence I was pulled further and further.  I can't imagine going through such a hurtful experience. But, it's definitely a must read. I wholeheartedly recommend it. Have your tissue box ready.
B002ZG976U|5.0|The movie is pure escapism.Cher is unworldly in her potrayal of Tess the Burlesque Queen.There is noone as unusal and iconic.She captivates the screen ,and is up to her game with her tongue in cheek performance.Christina isn't up to great acting,but the musical numbers are so beautiful and excitable thatt this isn't that important.The show songs that she does are her strongest.her song  Bound to you is a memorable screen performance, beautiful pathos reigns.<br />Cher is great on her two songs,proving some singers really sing better as mature performers.The storyline is so corny and sweet that one has to believe in ones' child emotions to enjoy the diversity and talents of the cast.Stanley Tucci is wonderful,and his scenes with Cher are loving and the chemistry is there.<br />This movie dares to be what it needs to be-fantasy and song,BRAVO! Give this movie a chance! Buy the dvd! You will enjoy the new escapism that musicals need to be.So much for the critics,Burlesque will live on past their cynical diatribes.
B001VNB54A|5.0|Formidable. To say the truth, the best war movie/series ever. Could only be better if it was produced using some kind technology that could imitate reality itself.
B0000074EF|4.0|If you have the Deram remasters of the 1st 3 CDs, you already have this material in a remastered format. If you want to hear the original lp mastering, this might be worthwhile. If not skip this and just go for the Deram remasters, theres a reason it's out of print, it's no longer needed.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|I had neglected to purchase this album till now amazon had it for $5. Anyway i have to say it was well worth 5 even worth 10! Great album Relapse was a fail in my opinion his raps where at an immature level on Recovery he shows you a more adult side and it is excellent. He still has his funny side on some songs which is fine but he also has more serious tracks that are amazing. This album is also produced very well with catchy beats and great bass in some of them which i enjoyed. I would almost call this his best album yet.
B003OPUZYY|4.0|This is a collection of remastered albums during Ten Years After time on Chrysalis records, which is post Woodstock. Some non lp single mixes are added with the original albums to fill out the 3 CDs of what many consider some of their best material.  A nice set for those looking to upgrade their old vinyl copies or a great place to start if you are new to the band.
0765326353|4.0|i had a hard time reading approaching this book.  I think its incredibly arrogant to start a projected 10 volume series.  It also limits the amount of time an author can spend doing other new work.  in this particular case, i had divided emoitions about the authors previous work.  Warbreaker is awesome.  The mistborn books, while great world building and incredible imaginative, where very predictable in plot development.  i really like his work on the Wheel of Time. His work there is almost better than robert jordans.  So he is both execellent and poor in quality.   Add to this that the first couple chapters are hard to adjust to (the world building here is completly new, nothing else like it in the genre)  and it makes it a slow starter, something to hold your opinion about until you get in there waist deep.         IT IS WORTH IT.  The payoff here is great.  I could explain in detail, but stories are best told by the author.  If you like fantasy, read it.
B003L1OACO|5.0|After reading all the other reviews I had to grab this, even though i already had the 2 CD deluxe edition from 2005, that this is based on.<br /><br />I was not disappointed, even though this is more about the packaging than the music inside.<br /><br />The Stooges Handmade album seems to be the 2005 remaster and a good part of CD 2 is also on the 2nd CD of the 2005 Elektra deluxe edition, but this is all about the complete Cale \\"Closet Mix\\" mix of the album.<br /><br />Some people seem to think the mastering by Rhino was flawwed, but if you know the history of the album, you know it was rejected by Elektra and now you get to hear why. The Cale mix cuts on the Elektra edition were pitch corrected and sound more lively, but it was studio trickery that did it, speeding up the tape to give it a more upbeat feel and make it closer to the released mix.<br />Now you get the original drone sound that Elektra refused to release in all it's sludgey glory.<br /><br />If you are a Stooges fan you will enjoy hearing the original album and 2 completely different versions for comparison.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|The description of this book captured my attention, but time after time I talked myself out of reading it, thinking it would be childish written from Enzo's perspective. I wish I would have read it sooner!  From the very beginning, you are drawn into the story of Enzo and his master, Denny. Somehow, Enzo becomes real, and if you look closely, you can see him tilting his head and trying to make you understand the language he speaks.<br />Enzo is complicated and simple at the same time, with an understanding far beyond what we give animals credit for. The Art of Racing in the Rain is well written, detailed and emotionally charged.  I found myself laughing at his antics, shaking my head in agreement, all the while picturing what was going on in my own dog's brain.  Seldom do I read fiction that grabs me from the beginning and holds me until the very last word, and then wishing there was more. This was a wonderful escape from the cold, harsh reality of winter.  It was funny, sad, heartfelt and simply beautiful.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|The only thing wrong with this book is that it ended.  I missed 2 meals and some sleep.  I couldn't put it down.  I only wish there were 1000's more pages.
B002M9WW30|3.0|I recently received the Blu-Ray box set collection of the Rocky movies for Christmas and was very happy to receive them until I began to watch them. Upon viewing Rocky II, the disc seemed to be corrupted. During the beginning of round 2 of the final fight between Rocky and Apollo, the disc stops and the movie becomes distorted where the movie stopped. I cleaned the disc and the player, but it stops at the same spot at approximately an hour and 45 minutes in to the movie. There is no scratch on the disc. I am wondering how I go about replacing the disc. If it wasn't for that disc, I would have given this Blu-Ray 5 stars.
B00008LOS1|5.0|For my money -- and heaven knows I've spent it on this album, owning or having owned probably ten different copies in various formats since the mid-1970s -- \\"Who's Next\\" is The Who's greatest work, and also one of the top five classic rock albums of all time. Give me this one, plus Led Zeppelin's \\"Physical Graffiti,\\" the Rolling Stones' \\"Beggar's Banguet,\\" The Beatles' \\"White Album\\" and Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon,\\" then come see me on my desert island in five years. Musically speaking, at least, I won't have reached boredom stage yet.<br /><br />The original issue of this album, with just the nine songs from \\"Baba O'Riley\\" to \\"Won't Get Fooled Again,\\" was killer. Guitarist Pete Townshend had discovered synthesizers, but instead of falling prey to the kind of syrupy goo other people were doing with the instruments, Townshend used his new toys to create rhythmic pulses or subtle colorings. The result was still rock 'n' roll, but a new kind of rock that soared into musical landscapes unimaginable back in the era of Fats Domino and Chubby Checker.<br /><br />Now, here's all you need to know about the Deluxe Edition: It isn't nonsense. The additional tracks aren't just filler -- they're all good, and many of them are amazing, like \\"Naked Eye.\\" They add to the set by showing that Townshend's songwriting at the time had reached new levels. He was working at the very top of his game -- even if the Who as a band didn't manage to turn all these songs into the planned rock opera Pete was calling \\"Lifehouse.\\"<br /><br />This is essential stuff. Highly, highly recommended.
1416550550|5.0|I discovered the books of Kate Morton last summer when I read The Forgotten Garden. I loved that book! I have to say that with all the jumping back and forth in time and characters, it could be a bit confusing at times, but to me it seemed to be symbolic of the ways the past and the present are all connected and interact/mesh together. I had to go back a few times to just remember specific dates in the story, but not so much that it lessened the intrigue for me. I was hooked by this story that spanned several generations, and the twisting mystery that it had. I have since read Morton's other two books, just finished The Distant Hours a few days ago in fact, and though The House at Riverton, didn't draw me in as much, The Distant Hours was another hit for me.   I just love Morton's writing style and the way she describes things.   All in all, I definitely recommend The Forgotten Garden, but don't stop there read her other books too!
B00377V6J2|5.0|Fantastic ... I have the CD in the car and the DVD at home on the  player.  When I feel down after a hard day I just play the CD and it puts a smile on my face.  The DVD is even better, watching Stevie Ray and Albert interact is just great. There is a chemistry between these artists that must be seen. It's unfortunate this is the only album they made together.

B004BLJQOK|5.0|My husband and I got Let Me In in the mail yesterday from Netflix.  After dinner, we decided to watch it and both of us really enjoyed it.  I especially liked when Abby got Owen to stand up for himself.  I was cheering from the couch.  This isn't your average vampire movie, it's unique and fresh.  I highly recommend it to horror lovers.

159562015X|5.0|I LOVE THIS TEST.    The book itself is kind of unnecessary and isn't the point of this.  It's the code at the end of the book (therefore, don't buy this used!).  The code allows the user to take a test online that reveals your strengths.  Once the strengths are revealed, then the book can be handy as a glossary reference to further meaning.      I have learned a lot about myself, and this was especially handy when I was applying for jobs and grad school.  It provided me with language to answer questions in regards to, \\"What do I bring to an organization\\".  I never had a real answer to that question until taking this test.  I have recommended it numerous times, and have purchased several copies of the book to give friends/family as gifts.      This is not a book for reading.  This is essentially the definitions to the results you get from taking the test.      I wish in order to take the test, I didn't have to buy each and every person the book just to get the code to take the test.  I would happily pay the price for just the code.  In our house alone, we have four copies of this book, which is unnecessary.
B000002LK1|5.0|Their best.  'World in My Eyes', 'Personal Jesus', 'Enjoy the Silence', 'Policy of Truth'.  All classic songs.  Great electronics, great vocals.  But the best song here is 'Waiting for the Night'.  Subtle synths and vocals.  Their most sublime effort.  'Waiting for the Night' is the song that makes the album.  Excellent work......
B003ASLJQS|5.0|Before I viewed this DVD, I had no expectations. I'd just been told who was in it and my interest peaked. I am so glad I chose this film--the acting, the writing, the past/present overlays, the storyline, the intrigue--whew.Practically a perfect film, on par with \\"The Secrets in Their Eyes.\\"
B003DZX3SA|5.0|Disney DVD's are a perfect gift for kids!  I collected almost all of them for my own kids (in those days my only choice was VHS!), now I'm collecting them for my grandchildren.  And DVD's, I'm sure, will withstand the years a bit better than the VHS models!  Be careful you don't miss out on the \\"Limited Editions\\"!  I did...I missed \\"The Little Mermaid\\", but  one day I just may find it!
0316098337|4.0|I enjoyed this book and the odd perspective it affords, although there were definitely areas that could have been improved, such as development of Nick and explanation of the fact that Jack has been nursed his whole life since his mother was trying to provide adequate nutrition in such a situation (if that was the case?).  Overall, quick and worth your time.

B00014X8KO|3.0|Magnetic Rose - the best short on the DVD, by far.  Great imagery, captivating storyline, wonderful imagination at work.    Stink Bomb - Stupid.  Totally unrealistic/unbelievable and not even funny.  Waste of space on the DVD.    Cannon Fodder - Got through about 10 minutes of it and fell asleep.  Skipped through to the ending after I woke up, but didn't miss much.      The DVD is worth it for Magnetic Rose alone, so I recommend buying it.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This DVD tells a story that is appalling to people concerned with truth in general and with their and others' health. Are the facts in the story true? I believe they are because there are a number of confirming books, videos, and magazine articles that tell similar stories. So, if the story is true, then the situation regarding many foods sold to the public in the United States is appalling. I suspect the situation is the same to at least some degree in other countries so the story concerns all of us. I mean who really has faith in the mass-produced foods imported from China or Brazil? Have you ever seen the videos of Pangasius fish farms in Vietnam or  salmon farms in Norway and the ones the Norwegians have opened in Canada? What is truly scary is the extent to which we suspect the corruption of some of our representatives in Washington and some key officers in the federal agencies meant to protect the public. With the disastrous Supreme Court decision in the Citizens' Union case which opens the floodgates of corporate and self-interested money that can be spent toward political ends, whose influence was confirmed absolutely in the recent Congressional elections, we, the public, are left exposed and unprotected unless we take action ourselves.  How can we take action? Stop buying processed foods, farmed fish, non-organically raised meat. Buy organic from trusted sources. It will cost more money but then you know that you need to reduce the volume of food that you eat so do it now and save some or all of that additional cost.  No amount of public outrage will persuade a representative to vote against the interests of a corporation that finances his election campaign because our system is such that he has no option to get elected or re-elected. No amount of public outrage will change our overly technical and procedure-heavy legal system that allows a hugely wealthy Monsanto to financially exhaust a farmer whose non-GM fields become polluted by wind-borne patented GMseeds and spores. The only way to cause change is to stop buying these terrible products and by-products and make market forces do the work that we can no longer trust others to do for us. We'll become slimmer and healthier at the same time.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|'The Pacific\\" is a stirring look at the so called \\"other war\\" that was fought during World War II and the Island Hopping Campaign to Japan. It is also a character study of the Marines that fought with the 1st Marine Division and how they transitioned to the brutallity to deal with the war and how they had to re-adjust to the civilian world that was left behind.    I recommend both the Pacific and The Band of Brothers for your library. It is a justified acknowledgement of the sacrifice that these World War II Generation troops went through. Since their was a movie about the Navaho Code Talkers and the 322nd Black Fighter Group ( The Tuskegee Airmen. Their should be a  movie about the American Japanese Infantry and Black Infantry Unit that fought in Europe and the Black Marines from Montford Point that fought in the Pacific along with the service women who sacrificed so much and the saga will be complete. Their should also be a movie about WW I trench warfare and Belleau Woods    World War I and World War II Vets thank you for your service.
B002ZCDR88|5.0|I found this quote about \\"NM\\" and thought it was as true today as in was in 1988: \\"Natalie Merchant possesses a purity of spirit and sincerity that most of today's disposable pop demons could never achieve, let alone comprehend.\\"<br />Sounds, 1988<br /><br />The songs on this double album grow on you as you listen to it. The songs are very relaxing. I enjoy playing the album while I work in my home office.<br /><br />This album was a labor of love and a great financial investment on her part.<br /><br />I think the songs are timeless. I believe people will be enjoying the songs decades from now.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|I had the pleasure of being assigned this book in my senior year English Literature class.  It quickly became my favorite book.  20+ years later....I've read it cover-to-cover so many times, I wore the binding off.  I now have this on my Kindle and read my favorite chapters quite often.<br /><br />Don't we all secretly wish for our own Mr. Darcy?
B0013FSL0C|3.0|Don't buy this as this is the third time I have purchased the box set and the fourth disc is blank!!!!!
0393312836|5.0|Ok, I'm way behind the times with this one.  But, lately I've been into dystopian fiction and this one seemed like a classic that I needed to be able to say I've read.  I have never seen the movie either and I figured I'd better read the book first.  When I first pick it up... I honestly could not get past the first page or 2.  The nadsat language really through me for a loop.  So, I put it aside for a few weeks, then came back to it and tired again.  I decided to just go for it and see if it started to make sense.... and after about a chapter I had the flow down.  In the end, the language of the book really hooked me.  It made it that much more fun and interesting.  So, if you too have a hard time at first, stick with it.  I promise it's worth it.<br /><br />I really liked this book.  It was much more thought provoking and intersting that I thought it would be.  The character Alex starts off real arrogant and annoying in the beginning... really asking for it.  But as the story goes on I really felt sorry for him.  He really makes his own bed the whole way through, but you still can't help but feel for him.  What I find really interesting is that the final chapter was originally left out of the American version fo this story.  Personally... I don't think I would have liked the book as much without that final chapter.  For me, it really made the whole story.  But I don't want to give anythign away so that all I have to say.  :)
B00280LYIC|5.0|i read this book a few years ago and loved it. i read the whole series in a month. now i have to read it again for school and im so excited. you just cant put it down once you pick it up
B002ZG981E|5.0|Please buy this movie!! In my honest opinion this has got to be the best movie of the year, Leonardo di Caprio and the rest of the cast are unbelievably good. Excellent performances, excellent story!! My respects to the person who wrote such a complicated, perfect story. The special effects are awesome!!!!! It's gonna blow your mind away!!! I went to the movies to watch it and when I came out, I wanted to go right back in and watch it again. I definitely recommend you buy it!!!!
B004I7IPL2|4.0|This is the final movie huh,good,the series was getting well off track.That being said,I recommend this video since it ties up all the knots in the end,but there is two knots that aren't tied in the end: why is the guy from Linkin park chosen? and what happens to the guy that created the fake story at the end(does he just die there or gets out of that place he's in?)  -The ending is epic,definitely worth watching for those original SAW(I) fans...
B0041KKYD8|5.0|This is what the new breed and standard of horror should be like.  ISoYG was executed brilliantly through out and kept its respect for the first film but took it to the lengths of what hardcore horror fans want.    The acting was good, the pacing was great, very difficult to watch in places and the gore was brutal and realistic.    Just like the original it will have its controversy, but for horror fans it is a must see.
B0031ES8P6|5.0|Got this beanie baby for Christmas \\"gag gift\\" and I see it NOT to be a gag gift at all. Goes well with my other Hello Kitty gifts. Great for babies and children of all ages !!
0399226907|5.0|I heard a lot about this book, and even saw it on TV once. So I thought it would be fun to buy a famous book like this, and I bought it a couple months ago. Now, I'm not much of a book reader, but I gotta say, I could not put this book down! It's a nice story about a catapiller that has lots of suspense in the middle, when he gets stuck in the cocoon. Who are the bad guys who trapped him in the cocoon??? You have to read it to find out.  It also has some magical \\"science fiction\\" stuff where (SPOILER ALERT!) the catapiller escapes from the cocoon and somehow turns into a butterfly. That was a plot twist that really caught me by surprise!<br /><br />This book is sturdy, and has pages made of nice thick cardboard. So it's perfect for me to bring on the bus to read on my way to work. Now, I've got a question for all you \\"Hungrey Catapiller\\" fans out there: is this supposed to be a comedy book? Because whenever I read it on the bus, people around me look at the book, then look at me and start to laugh, like there's a \\"inside joke\\" in the book. But I never thought it was a funny book, just a suspenseful mystery. Maybe I just don't get the jokes, I guess.<br /><br />Anyway, I recommend this book to readers of all ages! Even when my daughter comes to my house on her court-ordered visitation, she will pick up the Hungrey Catapiller book and understand some of it. She likes it almost as much as her coloring books. So it appeals to Kids, too.<br /><br />I wish I could give this book more than \\"5 Stars\\"! I also wish I could feed the Catapiller, so he wouldn't be so hungry anymore.
0062502182|1.0|I bought and read this book. Very disappointed. My impression is a cross between Huck Finn and Harry Potter with a blurry line between innocent fable and spooky distortions of religion.
0439023513|5.0|I love how this trilogy ended, if for no other reason than - it always kept me guessing...nothing was truly predictable.  I was actually shocked to realize that some had rated this book so low!??!?  I think that if the author would have ended the book like they wanted, then yes, she would have sold out, but she didn't! Great books - I'm recommending them to every one that I know.

6304711905|5.0|It seems strange to review this movie after so many years have passed since its release. I have been a western fan all my life, and in my opinion this is the most accurate tale of the Earps and Tombstone, and especially of the gunfight at the OK Corral. With minor exceptions, everything in this movie, the events, dress, weapons, dialoges, are period accurate. ALL similar, previous movies were a big joke.  Even John Ford, in My Darling Clementine, messed up the story and everything else.  TOMBSTONE is one of the best, along with Shane and High Noon. To appreciate this movie go to Tombstone, like I have done many times. The duel between Doc Holiday and Ringo fits nicely into the plot, but to this day, Ringo's death has been a mystery, and historians disagree what happened. A similar situation existed regarding the Vendetta.  Wyatt never wanted to talk about it.  We have to remember that the late 19th century was a world in transition.  The frontier was ending. Things that were done in 1881 were unspeakable in 1900.  But, who cares.  TOMBSTONE is a classic, a delight for any western lover.
B000XCZGV8|5.0|I had never seen Zodiac before Christmas 2010 when it was on TV.  I became fascinated with the theme and found the 2 disc director's cut here on Amazon.  It is an amazing bargain.  There is a complete documentary showing interviews with remaining witnesses and police from the various jurisdictions involved.  There are specials on the Visual production - this is my favorite - much of the film is Computer Generated, and who would know?  There are two commentary versions - one with David Fincher, director, and the second with a whole bunch of people - this one was for me a little lacking, because I would have preferred to hear more from the two actors involved (Downey and Gyllenhaal), but still interesting.  Also the film can be viewed without subtitles or with English, Spanish, and French subtitles, which to me is a plus, although I realize not everyone is into subtitles.  If you are a Zodiac fan, or any time of crime drama fan, this is worth owning.
B001H9MWW2|1.0|Don't buy this. It might have just been me, but if it's not, this seller (especially this item) needs to be avoided. Why, you might ask? Here's why:    When I order a \\"two-disc special edition\\", I expect to get TWO DISCS. NOT ONE.    The case looked right: \\"Coldplay Viva la Vida Prospekt's March Edition. The back had both track lists. It would have been impossible to tell it was missing a disc from the outside.    But when I opened it, I found that, lo and behold, ONLY Viva la Vida was inside. No Prospekt's March to be found. I thought that perhaps, both discs were on one CD. Nope. The disc only had the 10 Viva la Vida tracks. I got conned out of 8 bucks.    The best part is, I can't return it, because it is now opened, and Amazon cannot replace/refund open items that were not their own fault. And since this is an independent seller, that qualifies.    My only chance at this point is to hope that enough listens to Violet Hill will make the CD worth twice as much to me.    My advice? Avoid megahitrecords. I know I will be.
B000EGDB10|5.0|By the mid 1990's Tom Cruise became the biggest box office star of his time. In 1996 he starred in the theatrical revival of the 1960's and early 1970's CBS TV series \\"Mission:Impossible\\" playing good-looking Ethan Hunt, an undercover spy working for the CIA. Many ardent \\"Mission:Impossible\\" TV show fans regard the filmed versions as stand alone stories as the only similarity between the series and films are the title and jazzy theme music. In the first outing Ethan is accused of killing his team of co-horts and it's entirely up to him to find the culprit who framed him.<br /><br /> \\"Mission:Impossible\\" was produced on an amazing $80,000,000 budget and it shows: the movie was filmed in many areas around the world including England and France and the action sequences are some of the biggest ever produced. The film eventually grossed over $450,000,000 and would go on to spawn four more sequels as of 2011.
0307270807|5.0|A Unique Achievement in Writing about War    The first and most important thing to say about Michael Herr's \\"Dispatches\\" is that it difficult to begin to do him justice; by its very nature, praise is comparison and Dispatches is incomparable: when you talk about Dispatches, praise is not praise enough.    A memoir of war-reporting written from the left-wing-peacenik perspective, Dispatches is like no other book and the world knows it credentialing it with reference and imitation.     John LeCarre gave it superlatives, Salman Rushdie quoted it in a speech; scenes from it are the basis of scenes in several of the most successful movies about the Vietnam War and, when one former soldier from the Soviet Union during it's occupation of Afghanistan wanted to write about the soldiers on the ground that his country put there, he used ideas and language garnered directly from reading Dispatches.    Among the things that are most striking about Dispatches are its truth, its depth and Herr's raw talent for transforming experience into a digestible, relatable experience that is so rich and so deep that the reader is filled with a sense of the writer's truth on both the large and the small scale; whether he was talking about the history of the war and our involvement in it    \\"it was spookwar then, adventure; not exactly soldiers, not even advisors yet, but Irregualrs, working in remote places under little direct authority, acting out their fantasies with more freedom than most men ever know.... hot on the sex-and-death trail, \\"lost to headquarters.\\"    or about the men on the ground, the actual soldiers, who were an amalgam of every human feeling. They were lost, lonely and lethal--but sometimes, some of them could be kind and caring beyond words    \\"Take your pills, baby, a medic in Can Tho told me. \\"Big orange ones every week, little white ones every day, and don't miss a day whatever you do. They got strains over here that could waste a heavy-set fella like you in a week.\\"or of subjective experience lived inside a savage, inescapable now    \\"Or dozing and waking under mosquito netting in a mess of slick sweat, gagging for air that wasn't 99 percent moisture, one clean breath to dry-sluice your anxiety and the backwater smell of your own body. But all you got and all there was were misty clots of air that corroded your appetite and burned your eyes and make your cigarettes taste like swollen insects rolled up and smoked alive, crackling and wet.\\"    That last sentence is the mark of Herr's real genius: his voice.    Herr's voice in Dispatches is something that every writer, would kill for: pure golden music wedded to an intensity of focused purpose that says \\"war\\" more effectively than a thousand words of battle description would.     Herr's writing is the true poetry of a war that was unlike any previous war in the American experience; one that had left behind the idea of steeling yourself for battle and facing death in a way that would rush in like the tide, go on for a time and then recede. Herr's voice was the voice of someone on a regular military's side of guerilla war; of being surrounded by the real and constant possibility of dying by surprise, dying before you were ready; by ambush or by booby trap or sniper shot, or simply putting your foot down on the wrong six-inches of unknown ground.    Herr sets feeling to the rhythms of his gift so well, with sentences so full of twists, turns and afterthoughts, that you're carried along and you wonder if it isn't all some sort of magic trick: you wonder if Herr could have sat down one day at a desk to describe pink tissue paper, closely, precisely and in a way that would make you want to run screaming...    Dispatches is not a good book, it is not a great book, it is unique and everyone who wants to read and feel should read it.     It is one of the few books of its time and subject matter that withstands multiple readings and if you are reading it for the first time, you're luckybecause it might very well change your conception of reading: you will never have read it before and there will be many, many things afterwards that you will never read the same way again.
B00003CXDG|5.0|After fighting with Paramount to spend some big bucks in producing the theatrical version the the TV series \\"Mission:Impossible\\" in 1996 the studio gladly shoved $125,000,000 in the budget of its sequel that came out in 2000. Even better than the original, \\"Mission:Impossible 2\\" has more car chases, more action-packed sequences, and bad guys than a normal James Bond film. If anything with the release of \\"Mission:Impossible 2\\" this movie franchise really has become the Bond film's greatest competitor as Ethan Hunt has everything Bond has: looks, charm, guts, and sheer luck.<br /><br /> In the sequel Ethan Hunt's mission is to track down a deadly virus and its cure before a mad man takes control of it and destroys the world. The plot sounds absolutely rediculous but the film is high-energy, fast-paced, and exciting.<br /><br /> \\"Mission:Impossible 2\\" made over $540,000,000 at the box office and spawned two more sequels as of 2011.
B000SZQNLC|5.0|I bought this vinyl for one song: Fool In the Rain.  I played the vinyl and of course listened to the song I particularly wanted and was amazed by the sound quality of all the tracks. This album sounds just as good if not better than my 2010 release albums. Plus the album as a whole was very good. Now I own the only Zeppelin album that my dad doesn't own.
031603438X|5.0|HIGHLY recommend Keith Richard's autobiography. Great history of Rock N Roll from a living legend who should have died about twenty times over, but still miraculously remembers every vivid detail.  Charming, funny and smart, it will win you over even if you're not a Stones fan.  I don't feel that it sagged through the last third, for me it was intriguing from beginning to end.    I was quite sad when it was finished.  Would love to listen to his voice telling the story next time, that would give it all the added dimension of hearing that voice tell the story.  Enjoy!

B004A8ZWT2|2.0|When I got dragged to see this in theatres, the one bright spot i kept telling myself was depp is a good actor and he is, well most of the time, in very good movies. In the very least, one that makes you think....For this Movie, that was not the case. It was well-acted, the scenery was great, but it was very obvious how it was gonna end in the first 30 mins.
B003YK42M0|5.0|I liked Kings of Leon before I bought this album, but had no real knowledge of anything they had done on this particular one. I really just wanted some interesting indie sounding rock for my vinyl collection and knew that KoL could deliver that if nothing else. I put this on my turntable with no expectations at all and was quickly blown away. I soon found myself playing the album over and over again. This album has my vote for sure. Great work KoL.
B00377V6J2|5.0|Just watch this last night for the first time and it gave me chills. The hair on the back of my neck literally stood up while watching two of the blues greatest guitarist at the pinnacle of their powers play together with such joy. The DVD release is long over due. Like many people knowing that there is more material out there I would like to have seen a more complete release. The CD has three songs that are not on the DVD and the DVD has three songs not on the CD. Hopefully we will not have to wait another 11 years before double CD\DVD sets come out. Also, it would have been great if the film continued to roll at the very end when they are finished with their jam. Man what a release and at a great price.    I have long said that SRV best release is actually an Albert King album In Sessions shows a young Stevie playing with restraint, but with great joy. Albert really puts in the effort and it was great to see him backing up Stevie on songs like 'Don't you lie to me'. Albert does a great job on the two Stevie tunes (Texas Flood and Pride and Joy). Albert is clearly holding court and Stevie is only too happy to be playing with his idol.     The back up band is excellent and they are clearly enjoying the session as much as Stevie and Albert. It is great to see and hear Albert with a high quality back up band - this has not always been the case with Mr. King throughout his career. Speaking of high quality the sound and video quality is excellent. This is basically studio quality sound. Thank god this meeting was captured. Leave it to the Canadians to capture one of America's most significant cultural contributions.    If you have only the CD - buy this right away. If you don't have either and are a blues fan - buy it right away. If you like good music - buy this right away. Let's hope they release the whole thing someday. Its an important piece of work that needs to see the light of day.
B002SF9YUM|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect with this film but it is stunning.. beautifully photographed, the acting - heart breaking.  I have watched this film several times.  It is compelling, gripping, and sad; it draws you in and haunts you.<br /><br />The acting is wonderful and genuine.  Javier Beltran beautifully creates the tragic Lorca but it is probably Robert Pattinson that has people seeking the film now.  Mr. Pattinson may have critics who begrudge him his Twilight success but his performance here as Salvatore Dali is captivating.  He transforms from the painfully shy and frightened young student to the eccentric, grandiose, successful artist.  It is the most challenging role in the film because this character goes through the most changes.<br /><br />Dali created himself much in the way he created his art.  And Pattinson captures this.  You take the journey with him.<br /><br />I think this was a pretty courageous role for a young actor.
0385341008|5.0|I thought this book was completely delightful.  It came highly recommended and I was not disappointed.  It is uniquely written, unlike anything I have read before.
B004615WKM|5.0|I know the sole reason that a band gathers a following is from there first works...check go it! However; C.A.S is a great album and I like the direction Kings of Leon have gone.  There original sound did not sound like the right style for there band.  They are a little more contemporary / main stream now but I love the guitar riffs and bluesy bass chords.  I would highly recommend this album to anyone.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|This is a very nice Blu Ray set of the Alien movies.  I expected to get a dinged up or defective package for the $60 price, but it arrived in perfect condition and the discs all seem to play back normally, although they are a little slow to load.  As for the movies, I can speak for the first two: Alien and Aliens. Both of these features have redefined the term \\"remastered\\". Both feature look incredible and the sound is era appropriate having been made in the late 70's and mid 80's.  One feature I would have really liked is a remastered soundtrack in 7.1 sound. I guess we may see that feature when the movies are released later this year individually (speculation only).
0545123275|5.0|I'll make this quick. I COULD NOT put it down! I spent the first few chapters praying Sam and Grace would meet but when they did it was so unexpected and clever. The book then flows into the two getting to know each other and finally exploring their love. The constant fear of Sam changing is always there making you afraid to step away from \\"Shiver\\" for even a second. It is cleverly written and the characters easily lovable, even straight-forward Isabel. And the ending? AH! I immediately rushed to find the next book, I can't get enough. I give it 5 stars for it's original and captivating take on werewolves and the much needed break from vampire stories.
B003ZK58WM|3.0|In Follett's best books such as &#34;Pillars Of The Earth&#34;, he succeeds by showing us history. Truthfully in &#34;Pillars&#34; the storyline is not over complex. The protagonists aren't really either, but in the end I didn't especially care as the book became a peep show of the past and cathedral building. In this book the scope is far wider and the history better known. This forced the author to rely on human story, and really, this is not Follett's strength. His old spy novels lacked nearly all action and human &#34;juice&#34;. The same problems exist here. A far more effective book may have been the story of a squad of British Soldiers during years of trench warfare, or the early air service, or the trade union movement when people still had the over-classes out in the open and blatant in their use of violence. In the end, this is more history than novel. The sense of place so strong in &#34;Pillars&#34; is entirely lacking here.

She has the heavy-hitters in every field - nutrition, medicine (functional medicine, at that!), spirituality - all adding the the research and experimentation she's done in her own life. Truly one of the best health and wellness books I've read since China Study and Michael Pollan's books (Kris' \\"nerd crush\\"!). It's not a diet, it's a lifestyle.

0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games = WOW! Absolutely fantastic. I couldn't put this book down. First, for those of you who haven't been fortunate enough to read it yet, here is the back cover blurb:    \\"In the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts. The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV. Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives alone with her mother and younger sister, regards it as a death sentence when she is forced to represent her district in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead before--and survival, for here, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weigh survival against humanity and life against love.\\"    I'll be honest, after reading this blurb, this didn't sound like my type of book. I've never really been into dystopian fiction, or dystopian YA fiction. However, I'd heard so many great reviews of this series that I finally bought the book and just had to see for myself.    I literally COULD NOT put this book down. My fiance had to finally pry it from my hands, so I would finish up studying for my finals and writing my final papers. Word to the wise, if you have something important to do, don't start reading this book because you won't get it done--save it for a nice weekend read.    The Hunger Games is addicting. Not only is the story full of non-stop action and adventure, but the novel is very well written and will keep you on the edge of your seat and in love with the characters from page one. I can't say enough good things about this book. It is definitely being archived on my shelf as one of my new favorites, and I've already bought the two sequel books (Catching Fire and Mockingjay).    This book appeals to any one of any age, whether or not you are usually a sci-fi dystopian reader--this is a book for anyone.    This book is absolutely fantastic, and if you don't like it, there must be something wrong with you. Lol, just kidding about that last part, but seriously, this book is great and you NEED to read it. I give it my highest recommendation.    So for those of you who haven't read the novel, run to your local bookstore this very second and buy this book! You will not regret it.
B003MC5N28|5.0|must book ever i read this for a book group my friends and i thought the community was full of cannoballs . best series ever
0545123275|3.0|Synopsis: \\"For years, Grace has watched the wolves in the woods behind her house. One yellow-eyed wolf--her wolf--is a chilling presence she can't seem to live without. Meanwhile, Sam has lived two lives: In winter, the frozen woods, the protection of the pack, and the silent company of a fearless girl. In summer, a few precious months of being human... until the cold makes him shift back again.    Now, Grace meets a yellow-eyed boy whose familiarity takes her breath away. It's her wolf. It has to be. But as winter nears, Sam must fight to stay human--or risk losing himself, and Grace, forever. \\"    Genre: Young Adult--paranormal romance    First Sentence: \\"I remember lying in the snow, a small red spot of warm going cold, surrounded by wolves.\\" What an awesome first sentence! That is definitely a good way to open a novel. From this, not only do we know that she is in trouble, which sets the tension rolling, but we know the setting and roughly what time of year it is as well. Great opening!    Brownie Points: Stiefvater has a great ability for creating a surreal tone. As a writer of both fiction and screenplays, I can honestly say that it's hard to give a movie a surreal feeling, let alone a novel where you only have words to work with. But Stiefvater manages to do this, and seemingly, with ease. I would describe her writing as entrancing. Kudos to her! On a non-writing related note, I love the covers of this series! Do you see the wolf that blends into the background? Awesome!    Beefs: Once I'd reached around page one hundred, I wanted a bit more conflict and action. The romance between Grace and Sam was sweet, but I wanted something to actually happen. There was lots of internal, emotional conflict, but very very little external conflict. If you like plot driven novels, Shiver is not for you, but it would definitely appeal to those who like character driven stories. However, for me personally, by the end of the novel, I didn't feel connected to either of the characters. I thought their romance was sweet, but I didn't really feel like I knew either one of them as people--or as wolves.    Ending: No qualms with it. It was equally as good as the rest of the novel.    Recommendation and General Comments: I had heard many people say that this novel was full of commercial appeal with literary quality writing. I can definitely agree with that. However, the literary and whimsical tone of the novel faded around page seventy. This certainly wasn't a bad thing and the writing was still great, but I did notice the shift. I'm looking forward to reading the next novel, Linger.    This novel is recommended to lovers of young adult, paranormal romance, and character driven stories. While I'd have liked more plot, it's a good read. If I had purchased it in paperback version, it would be something I would loan to friends and family. If you're a fan of the aforementioned genres and novel characteristics, you should definitely check this book out.    To read more review details please go to [...]
B004EQAVFU|1.0|*** This review contains spoilers ***<br /><br />If there is one film you should avoid like the plague in 2011, it's 'Never Let Me Go'! Based on a pretentious novel by the Japanese novelist Kazuo Ishiguro, it's a story set in a dystopian England roughly between the 70s and the 90s.<br /><br />The story begins with three children, Kathy, Ruth and Tommy who attend Hailsham, a boarding school, run by an autocratic headmistress, Miss Emily, well-played by Charlotte Rampling. The children are brainwashed to accept the idea that when they grow to adulthood, they will become organ donors, in order to save terminally ill patients.<br /><br />When we finally flash forward to when the three children become adults, they continue to passively accept their fate as organ donors. In this film, we're asked to accept the idea of a world where there is no free will and adults walk around like zombie-like robots, simply waiting to accept their preordained fate.<br /><br />As the story unfolds, Kathy, Ruth and Tommy end up at a place called 'The Cottages'. There Kathy is turned off by the physical relationship between Ruth and Tommy. Ruth here is the antagonist, who taunts Kathy for her inability to accept her sexuality. Later, Ruth starts the organ donation process and begins to physically deteriorate. A rumor has been going around for a long time amongst the organ donor people that a couple can get a 'deferment' if they prove they're in love. Feeling guilty, Ruth gives Kathy and Tommy a contact address where they possibly can obtain a deferment since Ruth is no longer in the picture to drive a wedge between them. When they arrive at the house, they meet the old headmistress (now in a wheelchair). She tells them that the deferment was simply a myth and they can't get out of being organ donors.<br /><br />On a deserted road, Kathy stops the car she's been driving and lets Tommy out; he breaks down since he realizes he can never have a relationship with Kathy. Soon enough, Tommy's organs are harvested and we fade out as Kathy awaits her turn. Unbelievably, that's all there is to this ludicrous story! The only real significant conflict is between Kathy and Ruth over their affections for Tommy. They never attempt to revolt against the 'system' which would have made the film more exciting and interesting. Instead, the principals' ongoing passivity is a big bore and the love triangle is ordinary.<br /><br />While Carey Mulligan is certainly pleasing to look at it, her taste in scripts is highly questionable ('An Education' was only slightly better than 'Never Let Me Go'). The cinematography here was impressive and the soundtrack had a moody, haunting quality to it. But why do we hear the soundtrack almost continually throughout the entire movie? Could it be that the story is so inert that the director had to rely on the music underneath to suggest true emotions?<br /><br />'Never Let Me Go' is perhaps one of the most 'one note' films I've seen in recent memory. Avoid this one at all costs, unless you enjoy waiting around to see your main characters have their body parts extracted without the slightest protest!awaits her turn.

0439023513|5.0|Synopsis: \\"Katniss Everdeen, girl on fire, has survived, even though her home has been destroyed. Gale has escaped. Katniss' family is safe. Peeta has been captured by the Capitol. District 13 really does exist. There are rebels. There are new leaders. A revolution is unfolding.    It is by design that Katniss was rescued from the arena in the cruel and haunting Quarter Quell, and it is by design that she has long been part of the revolution without knowing it. District 13 has come out of the shadows and is plotting to overthrow the Capitol. Everyone, it seems, has had a hand in the carefully laid plans--except Katniss.    The success of the rebellion hinges on Katniss' willingness to be a pawn, to accept responsibility for countless lives, and to change the course of the future of Panem. To do this, she must put aside her feelings of anger and distrust. She must become the rebels' Mockingjay--no matter what the personal cost.\\"    Genre: Young Adult Dystopian    First Sentence: \\"I stare down at my shoes, watching as a fine layer of ash settles on the worn leather.\\" Not a very invigorating first sentence, but the first few paragraphs and first page as a whole are definitely interesting.    Beefs: I'm absolutely in love with this series, but I wasn't a huge fan of this book's ending. I'll elaborate more on that below. (SPOILERS AHEAD): My main beef with this book is Peeta's brainwashing. She changes his character and taints the rest of his and Katniss' relationship--forever. That kind of ruined the romance for me. I also didn't like the turn she took with Gale's character in making him become a ruthless fighter and severing his and Katniss' friendship. Further, I didn't like how Katniss' mom abandoned her after Prim's death. I was happy that Katniss' killed President Coin, however, I wish she had also killed Snow, rather than him being trampled to death. (SPOILERS FINISHED).    Brownie Points: Perhaps I said this in my review of the second novel, Catching Fire, but Suzanne Collins is a master at what we writers call \\"black moments.\\" Black moments are good because it puts the characters at their ultimate low, which allows us to identify with them on a very basic, human level--we all suffer at some point in some way. Every time I think that it can't possibly get any worse for Katniss and her friends/family, I'm proven completely wrong. Yet while Collins loads on the pain and torture, she manages to walk that tight line between the perfect amount and overkill with total grace. Not once during the entire series did I think she went overboard with the torture.    Ending: My main beef with the ending was how bleak it was. Katniss had to lose absolutely everything and everyone she loved before she was able to be with Peeta, and even then, her relationship with Peeta was tainted because of the Capitol. Even the epilogue about their future was bleak, thanks to the very last sentence about having to explain the Games. I would have preferred just a slightly more hopeful ending. Not necessarily happy, just hopeful.    Recommendation and General Comments:  I am in LOVE with this series. I'm completely, head over heels, ga-ga in love with it. It is now filed on my bookshelf next to the Harry Potter novels--that is the highest honor a book can have. The Hunger Games is excellently written, perfectly plotted, and keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the whole series. As the old saying goes, \\"I laughed, I cried, it became a part of me\\". I can't say enough good things about this series. I liked it so much that I'm writing one of my graduate school entrance essays (it has to be about YA literature) on The Hunger Games. Everyone should read this book. Whether or not you are a fan of young adult or dystopian literature, this series is something that everyone should at least try.    This is the mother of all recommendations. You NEED to read these books. There is nothing I can say to give them the proper amount of praise.    To see a more thorough review, please visit: [...]
B002BU0DPE|3.0|Gave to my 13 yr. old on Christmas and they broke on Jan. 16..but he thought he fixed but now Feb. 4 and they are broke again. Too late to return to Amazon.
0439023491|5.0|Synopsis: \\"Sparks are igniting. Flames are spreading. And the Capitol wants revenge. Against all odds, Katniss has won the Hunger Games. She and fellow District 12 tribute Peeta Mallark are miraculously still alive. Katniss should be relieved, happy even. After all, she has returned to her family and her longtime friend, Gale. Yet nothing is the way Katniss wishes it to be. Gale holds her at an icy distance. Peeta has turned his back on her completely. And there are whispers of<br />rebellion against the Capitol--a rebellion that Katniss and Peeta may  have helped create.<br /><br />Much to her shock, Katniss has fueled an unrest she's afraid she cannot stop. And what scares her even  more is that she's not entirely convinced she should try. As time draws near for Katniss and Peeta to visit the districts on the Capitol's cruel Victory Tour, the stakes are higher than ever. If they can't prove, without a shadow of doubt, that they are lost in their love for each other, the consequences will be horrifying.<br /><br />In Catching Fire, the second novel of the Hunger Games trilogy, Suzanne Collins continues the story of Katniss Everdeen, testing her more than ever before...and surprising readers at every turn.\\"<br /><br />Genre: Dystopian--young adult<br /><br />First Sentence: \\"I clasp the flask between my hands even though the warmth from the tea has long since leached into the frozen air.\\" I have to say, not the most intriguing of first lines, but for anyone who read or will read the first book, that doesn't matter, as I'm sure you will be as eager to dive into number two as quickly as I was.<br /><br />Beefs: For about the first hundred or so pages of Catching Fire I wasn't quite as intrigued as I had been previously. I can't say it was slow moving, because it wasn't, but I didn't feel the urgency to keep turning the pages as I had throughout the entire first book. But after those hundred or so pages, the novel quickly made up for it's slightly less invigorating beginning.<br /><br />Brownie Points: Suzanne Collins is an AMAZING author and one thing that I have to hand to her is that every time I think the Capitol can't be any more evil, it is. Every time I think Katniss and Peeta can't be any more gutsy and defiant, they are. She is amazing at torturing her characters, which is a major compliment, because who doesn't love tortured characters? It makes for fantastic conflict, raw and honest characterization, and characters we can ultimately identify with.<br /><br />Ending: FANTASTIC! There were certain parts that I somewhat expected, but others that totally blew my mind. I don't like endings that come out of nowhere and are completely unexpected, so this ending was perfect to me, both surprising and realistically fit to the story at the same time. I couldn't have asked for a better ending. Collins is a master at great endings.<br /><br />Recommendation and General Comments: I'm absolutely and completely head over heels in love with this series. When I fall for a series, I fall hard and I have fell so hard I've smashed into the ground with this series. It is definitely in my favorites. It's right up there with the Harry Potter Series and the Southern Vampire Series. Harry Potter is still my favorite hands down, but the Hunger Games is a close rival and definitely an equal favorite to SVS, though for different reasons.<br /><br />This is the mother of all recommendations.

0553381687|5.0|This book is the most real feeling fantasy I've ever read. George R.R. Martin did a phenomenal job of making each character and event feel so real that visualizing what was going on was effortless.  I've read authors that are too detailed and use too many words when trying to describe something, but Martin achieved this with a fraction of the amount of words (despite the length of the book!).  He was incredibly efficient with what he wrote down.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|Natalie Portman was so incredible in her role as a ballerina sinking into madness as she seeks perfection in her dance.  Mila Kunis was superb as her \\"rival.\\"  Vincent Cassel was totally believable as he pushes Portman to find that perfection. The film was disturbing to watch early on showing the pain and suffering dancers endure to become the best.  It becomes more and more surreal and disturbing as the Portman character begins to lose touch with reality. But, the movie is so convoluted one is never sure what is real and what is imagined.  The graphic scene with Kunis making love to Portman - real or not? Kunis as the rival - real or not? The movie is masterful as the madness is shown to slowly manifest itself until it completely overwhelms not only the character but the viewer as well.  I gripped my seat as I watched and although I wanted to avert my eyes at times I was transfixed until the culmination.  While I recommend seeing this film, I would suggest to not watch late at night in order to not have nightmares that would unavoidably come.

B003UESJHO|5.0|The best boxing movies aren't just about boxing and that's what makes David O. Russell's The Fighter such an impressive achievement. With an impressive cast of actors lead by Mark Wahlberg (also a producer) and Darren Aronofsky as the executive producer, The Fighter takes a story that's been told before but presents a fresh, entertaining take on it. The title card `Based on a True Story' and the idea of a \\"boxing movie\\" has become a cliché but The Fighter isn't just a feel-good movie about a down-on-his-luck boxer making a comeback and that's where it really succeeds.    The film begins in Lowell, Massachusetts in 1993 where Dicky Eklund (Christian Bale), a former professional boxer who knocked down Sugar Ray Leonard fourteen years ago, is being followed by an HBO documentary crew who, he claims, is documenting his comeback. Dicky is known as the Pride of Lowell, but his career has fallen by the wayside due to crack addiction. Crack hasn't taken Dicky's drive, but it's ravaged his body and withered his potential. His younger brother Micky Ward (Wahlberg) is a 30-year-old welterweight boxer trying to prove his worth in the boxing world, but going nowhere with his overbearing mother Alice (Melissa Leo) managing him and Dicky training him. Coming from a large family that includes seven (loud-mouthed) sisters and his father George Ward (Jack McGee), Micky puts family above all matters but is becoming disillusioned with the idea of trying to make it as a boxer with Alice as his manager and the increasingly unreliable Dicky as his trainer. George, the frequently berated, disrespected, and unappreciated husband, is the only level-headed member of the brood. Frustrated by how his commitment to family has affected his career, Micky takes a hiatus from boxing and meets a bartender named Charlene (Amy Adams), whose assertiveness drives Micky to realize his potential.    Movies of this type come out every year, but this film benefits from more depth and more classic themes than the usual predictable boxing fare. Set to a great classic rock soundtrack, the film's main theme is the importance of family and is about family ties and personal relationships while maintaining the boxing film motif with themes of overcoming personal boundaries and not giving up on your dreams. It's an inspiring film, exciting even when you're aware of the eventual outcome, with well-handled, entertaining boxing scenes. It's quite humorous too, but this humor doesn't come from the script but from the characters and how they may remind us of people from our own lives. For this reason and the existence of over 100 years of cinema before it, some characters may seem familiar to you. Alice is a selfish woman, more concerned with her children doing things for her than doing things for themselves. She puts on a show for the documentary crew and likes the attention she gets because of her two boys, whether it's as a result of their successes or failures. Along with everyone else Alice is aware of Dicky's drug habit but refuses to acknowledge it, even when she has to go to the crack house to retrieve him, prompting him to jump out of a second story window out of fear. Micky has a daughter named Kasie whom he sees every other weekend, but is not on good terms with the mother. This relationship with both the daughter and her mother is underdeveloped, but we get the idea from having seen it before. I mention these familiar areas to emphasize how great the performances are in this film. The Fighter is a very good movie, but the performances here are so nuanced and so layered they lift it to greatness.    Wahlberg plays Micky as tough, but sensitive; not too bright, but sensible, trying to do what's best for himself but not wanting to turn his back on his family. He hits all the right notes as Micky and, in a different movie he would probably be the center of attention. Wahlberg is completely overshadowed by the supporting characters and the film's biggest flaw could be thatthe main character is not as interesting as the characters around him. Leo is probably going to win the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress and it would be a richly deserved win, as she's a remarkable actress that impresses me more every time I see her. She disappears into her characters to such an extent that I sometimes don't realize it's her until the film ends. Alice is an unlikable character familiar to most moviegoers, but Leo doesn't make Alice into a caricature by effectively tapping into what drives this woman and making her feel like a real person. The Melissa Leo in The Fighter is indistinguishable from the Melissa Leo in another 2010 film called Welcome to the Rileys which is a testament to what a remarkable actress she is. In a scene late in the film, she changed my entire opinion about her character by simply looking at Wahlberg. I was floored. Amy Adams is a very talented actress that plays Charlene with fiery conviction, but she has no chance for Oscar glory next to a performance of Leo's magnitude. Rarely mentioned is the performance by Jack McGee as George, but he's the hidden gem of the performances. As the submissive husband who sometimes suffers physical abuse at the hands of Alice, McGee brings great humor and humanity to the role. But the real star of the show is Christian Bale:    Dicky Eklund was once a star to people, and he still is, but for a different reason which he doesn't seem to consciously acknowledge. He's nice and likable, with good intentions but is a flawed character. Dicky is a role with Oscar bait written all over it, but Bale doesn't seem to tackle it the way many actors would. Ironic, since Bale is going to win the Academy Award for this role. With significant success in Hollywood blockbusters, people tend to forget what a great actor he is but this performance will remind them. This is more than just an actor losing a bunch of weight, and while Bale's physical transformation is remarkable (particularly when he's standing next to Wahlberg, looking so much smaller in comparison) he brings so much more to the character. The nuance he brings to Dicky; the way he captures the mannerisms, the voice, the personality, and the physicality is incredible. He shares a convincing brotherly charisma with Wahlberg and brings emotional potency to the film too, such as the scene where Dicky is arrested. A role like this would lead some to overact, but Bale is in complete control of the performance. There's no lesser way to say it; Bale is a revelation, further demonstrating he's an actor capable of anything. Look at the big scene between Bale and Adams in the last few minutes of the film. Think of how many times you've seen this scene played out in movies before. Now watch how Bale plays this scene and how it compares to the way other actors would have played it. It's a flashy performance, but not one without subtlety. It's a perfect collision of style and substance.    As I said, the best boxing movies aren't just about boxing and the movie is aware of that going in and manages to come out as a terrific entry in this tired genre. It's not profound or unpredictable, but it's one of the year's best films due to brilliant performances and smart execution. You may think I'm over-rating the film when I admit that it hardly differs from a familiar formula, but The Fighter is so much better than its familiar storyline implies. Even the most unique films of 2010 didn't have performances as great as these. Love it or hate it, you can't deny that nor can you deny that this is one well-made, entertaining movie.    GRADE: A-
B002ZG9940|4.0|\\"The American\\"(2010) is directed by Anton Corbijn (Control). The film is an adaptation of the 1980 novel \\"A Very Private Gentleman\\" by Martin Booth. George Clooney(Jack) portrays an assassin who is also a custom arms dealer who flees to Italy in the mountains of Abruzzo. The movie is reminiscent of Antonioni's film \\"The Passenger\\" (1975) in its slow pace, feeling of alienation and spiral to a place where death waits. Jack is in hiding but is also extremely exposed being the lone American in the small Italian town of Castel del Monte. The town is a labyrinth which both conceals and traps Jack. He is always looking over his shoulder as he is continues to be pursued by assassins. What unfolds very gradually is his changing outlook on life, and his future possibilities when he befriends another foreigner, Clara (Violante Placido), who's a prostitute. The film reads more like an existential film, than a typical thriller of cat and mouse, as it focuses on the life a man has chosen that leads him essentially to a dead end with little chance of escape.
031603438X|4.0|I have a large collection of classic rock biographies and have enjoyed \\"Life\\" more than most.  I was a huge Rolling Stones fan when I was young and am still fascinated by their story.  Keith is frank, this is no cover-up or glossed over story.  Keith is frank about all the grit and the ups and downs of being a Rolling Stone. As might be expected, a great deal of the book revolves around his decade long addiction to heroin and the impact it had on his life and those around him.  Keith complains that even though he kicked heroin decades ago, he is still thought of as a junkie by the public at large.  As a musician, I was especially interested in the detail Keith gives us on how he achieved the unique guitar sound of the Stones by removing his E string and playing in an open tuning.  He spends a great deal of time discussing his musical influences and paying tribute to many of them.  The most fascinating portion of the book deals with his slow estrangement from his longtime partner, Mick Jagger.  If you enjoy rock books dealing with the Classic Rock era, You'll enjoy Keith's autobiography.<br /><br />Martin Rots author of [[ASIN:1449976662 The Woodstock Conspiracy]]
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Like many others, I was skeptical about reading a novel for \\"young adults.\\" I just turned 40! What am I doing reading this book? Ohhh, but I'm so glad I took the chance and downloaded it to my Kindle! It's a great story, with a great plot, great characters, lots of action... I devoured it within a couple of days.

142311339X|5.0|This book was great! I picked it up with a little hesitation, not sure how Riordan was going to continue the Percy series using new characters for the main point of view for the story. I loved how Riordan brings back characters from the original series and had them interact with the new in some interesting ways.    Another thing that was great about this book was the fact that it brought in new gods and villians. Riordan is digging deeper into myths and educating so many kids, and adults even about, greek and roman mythology.    Overall great book, can not wait for the second one in the series to come out in the fall.

B004BLJQOK|5.0|Owen is a boy that doesn't seem to have that much in life. He is bullied and not really seen by his parents, leading him to dream of other things. Amongst those dreams is something dark and hard, allowing him to see himself sticking a knife into those who pick on him. He also looks out his window and sees other people and there he envisions himself with another role. This play and this want leads him to see a 12 year old girl named Abby, whom he seems to like right away. Never mind the fact that she smeels different and never mind the fact that she doesn't wear shoes in the winter or know what a rubix cube is. she is something that he desires and that sees him as someone. She smiles after a time and she gives him advice, telling him to hit those who hit him harder than he dares. Still, she also says she cannot be his friend because she is not a she at all.<br />what does all this mean? Is Owen finding love or another dark hole? The questions and the answers are what makes Let Me In so good and then some.<br /><br />When it comes to Let Me In, the book and the foreign release are already in the books. They are good, too, adn they have a lot to bank on. Still, this release adds more, and makes its own remarks. Whether it is on the man that Abby lives with or the way things transpire with the acid and the man, it all takes its own shape. Even if you have seen it you will see more, and the more is great. The hospital, for example, shows you more of Abby and the first attack shows you more as well. you also have a new way of \\"collecting,\\" and a new presentation.<br />It all changes.<br /><br />I personally thought this was good and that it was its own thing. It had its own comments and its own style, making it make its own way forward. From the special effects window to the way the people are seen, there are changes and there are staples that are either needed and stay or that are played with and go. The people that live across from here are changed and yet they are still there, and these things are good and they leave other ways to see. I also like the way everything rounds to a close, with it changing and yet keeping things open, allowing it to be more. I like this as well, and I like the way that it is all seen. It makes a great dynamic and a horror movie, playing to all those invovled. It really deseves a watch.<br /><br />I admit I was afraid of this at first. I learned quickly, however, and this was good. It said that I would want to see and I did, and that left things in a nice place. It also left me with a 4.5 - 5 star movie, and a shocked look on my face. I expected good but not this. I am pleased and then some.<br /><br />Thank you.gs are good and they leave other ways to see.

B003JTHESA|1.0|I didn't grow up listening to Maiden. I only heard them for the first time at 17, so maybe to a point I did. I do really like these guys, but they have their good moments and their bad. Piece of mind, Fear of the dark, Brave new world, and Powerslave are all fantastic albums, and pretty much all their others have at least a couple really good songs, classics if you will. I have to say that since the stellar Brave new world, I've been very disappointed with this band, each album getting worse. Dance of death only had a couple songs I really liked, and none were classics, simply because I can't remember how any of them go now, and A matter of life and death only had one, The Legacy. Hell I don't think there were any other songs I enjoyed on that one. I could go into how they keep doing the same thing over and over, but none of that would matter if the songs were good, oh and memorable.   First off, if you're new to the band DON'T START HERE. Either get one of the albums I suggested, or Number of the beast, or Seventh son, or a compilation.   Enter 2010 and The Final Frontier. Well the lack of memorable songs is back, along with the songs all sounding the same. The songs on this album are way too long, and they in some cases, blatenly rip off previous Maiden songs. The intro to When The Wild Wind Blows is a rip off to Sign of the Cross. The intro to the first track goes on forever and serves no point, except to make a 4 minute song an 8 minute one. When I put it on my computer I had to remove it, and it made the song a much better one for it. The rest of the tracks don't really do anything for me either way. The last time I listened to it, tracks 2-4 started to grow on me, but without the instant classics, it makes it hard to force yourself through an album of songs that on a 1-10 scale would rate at 5's and 6's. Heck every time I've tried to listen to this straight through I pretty much fail, except for twice, and both of those times I was doing something else and notpaying close attention to the songs. Also most every song starts with a slow intro, another modern Maiden staple that could go away anytime now. It's BORING.   I will agree with some fans of this album in that the more you listen, the more it does grow on you. The last time I heard this album I actually made it all the way through.   Overall I guess it's alright for background music. I just get that, been there done that, feel to this album. I'm sure it'll please most fans, but for me I think they're capable of so much more... Well maybe not anymore if their last three, now, albums are any indication.
B003UESJH4|5.0|While this movie seems simple, it is anything but. It is a hearty and interesting film that takes the viewers into the world of the British monarchy from an angle most of us have never seen or heard of. Whether you're a history buff (like myself) or a general viewer, you'll love this film. It moves swiftly and interestingly, as well as allows plenty of space for its characters to grow and entertain you.    Colin Firth has been taking on more serious roles recently and his role as HRH Prince Albert/King George (AKA Bertie) is his best to date. His performance is unlike anything I've seen in recent films, which is why he has garnered so many honorable nominations and wins (so far). He plays the character in a very likable manner and well, you just can't help but feel sorry for ol' Bertie and his stammer. The way Mr. Firth stammers as if he were someone who actually had a speech impediment is amazing. I know he's mentioned he's had a hard time talking normally since filming the role, which goes to show you how dedicated of an actor he is. He made his character more than a character or a representation of a real person. Mr. Firth made Bertie a real person. A person we can relate to, even in the 21st century. Geoffrey Rush as his unusual speech therapist Mr. Logue is refreshingly humorous and helps round out this film into something more than just a historical story come to life. Even Helena Bonham Carter is quite good as HRH Elizabeth. Her accent and the way she utilizes her facial expressions makes you want to watch more of her on screen. It's nice to see her back to playing a normal British person and not 'Harry Potter's' Bellatrix Lestrange or some other crazy role. It's a well-rounded cast in a well-rounded film. 'The King's Speech' is a film people would be dumb to ignore.    The only thing I found to be a little off, but humorous at the same time, is the portrayal of King Edward's lady friend/future wife, Wallis Simpson. As a young person, I don't know much abouther, but I've read some about their love affair and eventual marriage, but my god they play her as such a gold digger. You really just want to smack her. Which I think adds to the movie. I did have a good laugh at her appearance in the film, though. As an American who has lived in England, I can see why they portrayed her the way that they did (Also, it's a film funded by the UK Film Council and the National Lottery! Guess they had to portray her a certain way to appease certain people). Whether it's based on fact, I don't know, but it's pretty funny. And annoying at the same time. At least she doesn't take up much of the story line for very long. Edward's arrival and departure from the throne really is an important part of the story, so I guess we have to put up with Wallis for a little bit.    'The King's Speech' is a film worth viewing over and over again. I can't wait to own it on DVD.
0545123275|5.0|Grace has had a weird obsession for the wolves that live behind her families home ever since she was attacked by them as a child. You would think she would be scared of them but instead she is left fascinated, especially by the one with yellow eyes. The one who saved her from the rest of the pack that terrible day.<br />This book was alittle hard to follow for the first 30 pages but hang in there. You'll be soooooo glad you did! After you get over that hump the pages start flying and before you know it, you've laughed, you've cried, and you left staring at the last page. I finished this book in a day and thank goddess I had Linger sitting there because I don't think I would have made it through the night. I dove right into the sequel.<br />This is a touching and tragic love story with a twist that I really enjoyed!!
B002ZG98C8|1.0|Omg... I laughed throught  it.. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY     Just an awful movie
0385341679|2.0|I like so many others could not wait for this book to come out. We were promised the conclusion to a very good Shadow series. What was delivered was anything but. Too many questions left unanswered. The other books kept me on the edge of my seat, this one I had to make myself finish.

0061801313|4.0|The books were not the way the other reviews made them out to be. i was ready to read a different type of book but ended up with these. i really enjoyed reading them though. they had so many twists and everytime you turned the page you had something new catch your attention. Very well written!
0812550706|5.0|I first read this book 6 years ago, and it change my life forever. It was my initiation into science fiction, and created an avid/monstrous reader in the process, for better and for worse. For the better, because I learned how to truly enjoy reading; for the worse, because I have been overcome with a toxic obsession for the next good book. For the first time in my life, I didn't want to eat, sleep, let alone do any real work/studying. So if that is what you're looking for, read this book!    If you are looking for something for your pre-teen to adult child, this is the book for you. If he/she hates reading, this is the book for him/her. My brother didn't like reading...until he read this book, followed by the co-quel Ender's Shadow, then Xenocide, then Hegemon, Shadow of the Hegemon,....that's right, he became a reader!    This is, by far, the best book I've ever read, and I re-read it frequently. I don't think you'll be disappointed.    Note: Although I didn't purchase this item on Amazon, this review is long overdue.
159562015X|5.0|This is an awesome tool.  It's great for individuals, including those in the job hunt.  Some results won't surprise you a bit, others put things in ways you wouldn't have seen so clearly, and some are pleasant surprises.  This is a particularly effective tool for teams to use.  Understanding your biases in your work habits and those of your teammates can be enormously beneficial.  The first time I used this tool we had a facilitator lead our analysis and discussion, which was great.  This time we self-facilitated (small team of 3), and it worked OK too.
B0034G4P7Q|5.0|The movie was great! I loved the low price for the Blu-Ray 2 Disc set and how fast it arrived, just two days after the release date!

B0034G4P7Q|2.0|Everytime I ask a person what they tought about The Social Network, they always say something along the lines of \\"it's a brilliant film about friendship and betrayal\\" or \\"It's just a movie about Facebook\\". I fall on the second camp.    The fact that the main theme of this movie is supposed to be betrayal just goes to show you how manipulative it really is. The Social Network's one fatal mistake is that it's set on making you hate the main character from the start, making him into a predictable and manipulative device with a completely uninteresting personality.    I'm all for amoral characters, I love stories when the line between black and white is not exactly defined and I think the characters in that grey area of moral ambiguity can make a film great. This movie tries to sell Jesse Eisenberg's character as an interesting person along those lines, only failing to realize that to pull that feat off you need to add some depth.     There was no friendship between the two main characters to begin with, making their dynamic feel forced from the start. They want you to believe that the creation of Facebook and greed tore these guys apart, and that the great irony of Facebook is that it was created from a number of strained social relationships; when there is really nothing there. The story ends up being a shallow, manipulative story about a completely uninteresting person getting rich.    ...Or, in other words, it's just a movie about Facebook.
0743244257|5.0|Walter Benjamin has said that a critique of a work of art is about the truth of the work. A commentary is about the content of the work of art. Unfortunately almost all of these reviews of Cosmopolis are commentary reviews about its content. To fully understand-not necessarily enjoy-this book one needs to be familiar with the work of Jean Baudrillard. Read Cosmopolis through Baudrillard and it will become a shining star for you. It is brilliant, contemporary and now that Cronenberg is filming it with his own screenplay in cooperation with De Lillo, maybe its meaning will leak into the thickest of its readers' minds. I'm not necessarily optimistic though after reading three pages of reviews before I screamed in silence and quit.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I ordered the movie late sunday night and received it in the mail on tuesday, was very pleased with the fast service, and I loved the movie  so i was very happy with amazon.com. i would use it again

I find myself popping in Sex and the City to play in the background when I want something on but don't necessarily have to pay attention. This series has been hard to duplicate since it ended airing.<br /><br />I actually purchased this gift set some time ago but had to comment on how the packaged product affects the quality of the discs.  At first look, the item is pretty stylish.  A book binder full of discs. Unfortunately, the discs are held in place with paper slots which scratch the surface of the cds. I'm annoyed because one of my discs skips now. If anyone knows where I can go to exchange that disc, please share :)
0060925000|4.0|This book came in nice condition, and it was SO cheap. But it did take a really long time to get to me.
B00005QGAX|5.0|SPOILERS FOLLOW<br /><br />\\"Bad,\\" Michael Jackson's 1987 smash album, is peppered with some of the singer's all-time signature songs.  Leading off with the fairly hard-edged title song, it overcomes at least one clunker (\\"Speed Demon\\") to deliver timeless pop and rock music.<br /><br />The album's second song \\"The Way You Make Me Feel\\" is a superbly constructed homage to the doo-wop sound of the early 1960's, complete with playfully romantic lyrics.  Additionally, \\"Liberian Girl\\" is an underrated gem in Mr. Jackson's catalogue.  A slow-simmering romantic number, it sneaks up on the listener with Jackson doing an uncharacteristically understated vocal.  A final song from this album that addresses romantic concerns is the classic duet \\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You.\\"<br /><br />Personally, this album also marks the first time I heard a definite social concern in Jackson's music.  (I was 9 years old when this record came out, and wasn't exactly listening to Michael Jackson's music for socially relevant themes).  I heard them clearly, though, in a famous masterpiece entitled \\"Man In The Mirror.\\"  It is a moving, highly creative song.<br /><br />Something also must be said of \\"Dirty Diana,\\" a flat-out rocker that would probably be higher on the list of Jackson standards if not for its mildly explicit lyrics.  As young as I was, I remember the controversy the song caused when it was released as a single.  The controversy is fairly overblown, as there are no curse words or other lewd lyrics in the song. Sexually suggestive language is the song's lifeblood, though.  The song is created with such artstry that the references should go over most young heads while losing no appeal to a mature audience.<br /><br />Also featuring \\"Smooth Criminal,\\" albeit in the shortened 'radio edit' Michael Jackson's \\"Bad\\" is one of the best pop and rock albums ever produced.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|THe lost hero is a great book I have read the entier Percy Jackson seres and i think the lost hero is the best of them all and is a great book for any one who likes reading action and  advencher books.
B004KPQK2S|3.0|I really wanted to like this movie, but...meh.  I felt like every scene contained stilted, unrealistic, proverb-like dialogue; people just don't talk to each other like that.  I couldn't see any real connections between the various characters, and most felt completely one-dimensional - despite valiant attempts to inject some life into the roles (particularly by John Malkovich).  And I had a very difficult time rustling up any compassion for Tweedy, who seemed to abandon her children completely to follow her own desires.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Wasn't quite sure about ordering this movie but once my nephew suggested it I haven't regretted it. A great clean family fun movie
B000002U82|5.0|As a young black man in 1973 (I wasn't African American yet) this is the first album that I remember that even the brothas use to listen too back in the day. Sure we were high most of the time but even through the years I've gotten a different essence from the music based upon where my life was. Let this be a lesson to never grow up because that's frankly is what many of the songs are about, avoiding the institutional thinking and traps that wait for us all. Bottom line is that it still Rocks!
B0049P1N3K|5.0|I cannot say enough great things about this book.  I found it (or, it found me) at one of the darkest times of my life.  From the first few sentences, I kid you not my life was changed.  This book holds the secret to true happiness and well-being.  I remember reading the reviews thinking, \\"this can't be real, these have got to be fake reviews by the publisher,\\" but something told me to buy it.  And it was one of the best decisions I have ever made.  In fact, I can't think of anything else that has impacted my life in such an amazingly positive way.    Thank you, thank you, for bringing this book into my life!
B001NLKT60|5.0|This is so intense.  I could not put it down and was unhappy when it all ended just because I got so involved I didn't want the story to end.  You must read them in order or at least watch the movie The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo. Can't wait to read the next one (The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets Nest).  Unfortunately, it will all end there since Stieg Larsson is no longer with us to tell us these \\"edge of your seat\\" stories about Lisbeth.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This fabulous series belongs on the shelf for that chilly evening when nothing is on the telly. For those times you want to show off that new HD television.   And for those grandkids who are not quite old enough to understand, but will someday.  And to see species and migrations that may no longer exist in the near future. And it's easier to store than 30 years of Nat Geo!
0061122416|5.0|This book should be read by everyone! Its such an awesome tale! It will def be required reading in my household! lol
B004DTLK8A|5.0|I'll just keep this short and sweet.....WOW...!!!!!!!  I'm not a professional music critic, just someone who knows good music. I gave \\"Polaris\\" 5 stars...I wish Amazon would let me give more for this one!!!  I've been a big Stratovarius fan every since I heard \\"Kiss of Judas\\", back in the day. I've been wrong in the past for not giving Timo his credit, but with Matias on board...it takes this band to a whole new level...!!!  This could be the one that brings them to top!!!  My favorite song is \\"Lifetime in a Moment\\"...at least for now. That might change after I listen to the CD 100 times or more (which there is no doubt will happen)....then I'll have another favorite...then another....then another....  CHECK THIS ONE OUT.....YOU WON'T BE SORRY!!!!!
B0040JHWKS|3.0|I just finished listening to the new Bruce Springsteen CD- 3,4 times and its pretty good.  Interestingly it doesn't sound anything like Darkness on the Edge of Town-  the howling voice isn't there, the hard rock sound, the razor edge guitar is not there,  I guess the great songs aren't there either, but that's the point.  These songs didn't make it, but I think he could have gotten a very decent single album out of this before he released Nebraska.   I don't know how critically acclaimed Nebraska was, but I know it wasn't commercially popular.  I think The Promise (maybe 10-13 songs) album could have rated up there with The River album, and even so, it rates a hell of a lot higher than some of the crap he released in the 80s.        It starts out a little disappointing listening to disc one- 5 of the 10 songs are not good at all- in my opinion.  You also have alternate versions of Racing in the Streets and Factory, as well as Fire and Because the Night- all good but nothing new.  But then side 2 starts right off very good and ends with the best songs- Breakaway, The Promise, and City of Night.  some of it sounds like Roy Orbison, some like Bob Dylan, no hard rock, more like Bruce's electric pop and folk sounds.  I find it hard to believe it took him 30 years to release these songs.  There some really good stuff here.
B004APVI1G|2.0|same hackneyed story about the progression of an underdog to a hero.  the 3D is pretty well done but the soundtrack is generally awful.  overall tone is pretty serious, but a couple attempts at comic levity are thrown in and fall flat.  if you like owls and Zack Snyder, stick with the Watchmen.

B001IBIHQ4|5.0|People who say is bad probably didn't even get the T.V. series trust me it made me cry, because it was so sad so that should indicate the history is very rich. The history is so rich, so emotional, and interesting. GET IT RIGHT NOW! Everything about it is great. (BLU RAY ALL THE WAY)
0439023513|5.0|***CONTAINS SPOILERS***<br />It's surprising to me that so many people dislike the ending of this book so much.  This series has been about war and sacrifice from the very first book.  The Districts were always paying for a war that happened a century ago.  The kids were sacrificed for punishment and entertainment. The people of Panem were starved, abused and neglected. None of this is happy stuff, why everyone thinks that there should be a fairy tale ending is beyond me.  Revolutions happened not just by fancy talks, but by the blood and sacrifice of a great many people.<br /><br />Katniss is turned into a soldier from the very first Games and everything that happens to her after is a result of that.  She very clearly has PTSD and mental issues by the end of the book, just as many front line combat vets do.  Did people really expect her to walk away from 2 Hunger Games and a war offensive in one happy little piece? That's just not that way life works.  It's not just the movie extras that die or the \\"Handsome Hero\\", it's anyone and everyone because war doesn't always just pick off the unimportant ones.  Yes, I wish that a few more people like Prim or Finnick had been left, but I think the point was to truly make you feel Katniss's loss, pain and detachment from the world around her.<br /><br />I loved the Gale character too, but after Katniss having been through so much and the philosophical disagreements that she and Gale had, I don't think they would have ended up happy.  Peeta not only loved her completely, but he understood and agreed with her on her moral principals.  They were the only two people that could truly understand what the other had been through and the only ones they may ever really trust.<br /><br />My only small gripe is that I wish the epilogue was a just a little longer and went into more detail about what happened to Panem and the peripheral characters in the book (Annie, Johanna, etc)as well as the recovery and relationship of Katniss and Peeta.  But really, it's a small gripe, I appreciate that there was an epilogue at all.gripe, I appreciate that there was an epilogue at all.
B002ZG981E|3.0|I will admit that after all the glowing reviews I heard about this movie, I was a little bit disappointed. Thats not to say it isnt a good movie, but it didnt live up to my expectations. Its very complicated, and if you stop paying attention for even a second, youll be completely lost. I dont mind that so much- in fact I usually like movies like that. And this was definitely interesting and action-packed, but still a bit of a letdown from the OMG THIS MOVIE IS AMAZING SEE IT NOW hype I heard when it was in theaters. Definitely worth a watch, and Im glad I saw it. But dont be fooled by everything you read. B+
0439023521|5.0|The world that Suzanne Collins has created is not happy and wonderful, it's actually sad and often horrifying.  However, it's also completely engrossing!  I could barely put it down, though there were times when it was so suspensful that I had to take a break because I was gripping my Kindle so hard I thought I'd break it.<br /><br />Suzanne really puts you into the Hunger Games with Katniss and Peeta and you feel exactly what they are.  The despair, pain, confusion and sense of just being a puppet that someone is controlling is palpable on every page.  She sucks you into the whole pomp and circumstance surrounding the Games and what it must be like to be around groups of people who are basically trussing you like a turkey that they are about to cook.  You feel the struggle of Katniss and Peeta to retain enough of themselves to be able to function again, but to also do what they must in order to survive.<br /><br />An excellent read, highly recommended!

B002JVWR9U|5.0|I absolutely loved this season! I watch it over and over even though the second season is now airing on television. It has some piont that are in the book, but for the most part I would have to say that it does not follow the books direction. With that being said I still have no complaints in the direction that the author is taking for both seasons one and two. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys fatancy creatures and light love stories :) If you like True Blood you are sure to love this as well!
1594202842|1.0|This author is just riding a short wave of popularity, probably to make money. She is irrelevant. Please don't give her the attention she seeks.

0060833459|5.0|Peter Drucker provides in \\"The Effective Executive\\" what is missing is almost every other leadership book I have read: incredible ideas without indulgent self-promotion. Drucker gets to the point, writing efficiently. He explains we can learn to be effective, how to determine our role and priorities, and how decisions are made.<br /><br />Although any of this can be applied to top brass positions, he respects that most of us reading this are in management at a much lower level. Keeping anecdotes to a minimum, and then, relying on history and major leaders (like Robert E. Lee), the book transcends Drucker himself and the 45 years or so it has been available. Never name dropping, the book reads like a smart textbook, not a management flavor of the month. Because of his approach writing, I left having learned how to manage better with lessons I expect to apply in real life.<br /><br />Much of his thesis comes down to our responsibility to the organization, not what can we get others to do. He uses the term \\"contribute\\" in that we need to ask what we can contribute, how, what is needed for the contribution. While he points out the obvious, that things will get done by ourselves and those below us, he also explains our superiors are likely to respond likewise through our example.<br /><br />A few useful ideas: Work on strengths, not weaknesses (dividends will be higher). Ask ourselves what will produce results (effectiveness starts here). Focus on the real future, not defending the past (if last year's product isn't this year's, move on). It is more than how-to, but also, it is about why: Why these are good ideas, and what can we expect from implementing them.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"The Effective Executive\\" by Peter Drucker.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />[...]

Caught Somewhere in Time!\\" is just lame.<br /><br />Me and my mates tried to like this when it came out.  But in the end it was no good...the next album was no better.  End of Maiden and Metallica just blew them away with Puppets.
B002ZG99IG|5.0|Minka Kelly is soooooooooooooooo beautiful and Leighton Meester is quite fine in her own right. They kind of look alike actually, but Minka is definitely finer. The movie is above average in the suspense and story line. Minka Kelly's beauty, sexiness, and cuteness kind of distracted me from the plot and what the people in the movie were saying. I kept wondering no girls on my dorm floor were nearly as fine.  And how fine it would be to be the third roommate living with them and hooking up with both of them simultaneously. LOL.  You keep wondering in the movie if the two roommates are gonna kiss and stuff. Do they. Do they not. Go see it to find out.

The first copyright was written in 1959 when thinking big about connecting England to Europe was just an idea. \\"The thinking that guides your intelligence is much more important than how much intelligence you have\\". A really wonderful book.

B001TIQT98|5.0|As one who had the joy to hear most of these early interpretations \\"live\\" and in their prime, hearing them again I feel like having been transported back in a time tunnel to relive these stunning experiences of oh so many years ago. Sony's first NYPO compilation at the time then seemed false, clumsy, and artificial, but now, what's this?<br /><br />WOW! - Unwilling a short time ago to shell out for Sony's usuriously priced Japanese set when it first became available because of it's cost, and unwilling to believe that it could be so revelatory of my memories anyway,it seems I ended up depriving myself of a great, great joy.<br /><br />In the end, it is astonishing that Sony which has deprived the music-loving public by not utilizing DSD for most if not all of its musical production has cheated us even more than I could ever have imagined with this reissue of Bernstein's first Mahler collection, for their engineers did a tremendous job with these discs - they're MAGNIFICENT (for what they are)!<br /><br />Let me explain. These recordings have been converted first using the DSD process, then into SACDs, and were released, advertised, produced, and marketed by SONY as SACDs in certain territories (Japan principally. As usual, we in the US have been denied access to this production, other than as limited imports at extremely high prices. And absolutists take note, this Mahler collection can not in the strictest sense be called genuine SACDs as it wasn't originally recorded that way. HOWEVER, Sony HAS released them as SACDs, and any complaints should be directed toward them - and boy, do they have a lot to atone for in their despicable treatment of this fabulous process they helped to develop!<br /><br />Still, the SACDs, completely honest or not, I'd love to hear from someone who has had the guts - and bucks - to buy the final SACD incarnation, whether it's worth additional purchases.<br /><br />P.S. I'd like to thank Robert L. Edwards for bringing to my attention the accidental publication of my previous, unfinished review of quite some time ago, which had not been approved for posting, and left out some important qualifications added here.<br /><br />Finally, real SACD or not, this current DSD collection is a big improvement over previous ones to remind us of Lenny's initial, excited reaction to Mahler!<br /><br />Buy it if you can.unfinished review of quite some time ago, which had not been approved for posting, and left out some important qualifications added here.

B003CN5SAY|4.0|I think that the writers were struggling to come up with new ways to shock us, but just kept turning these characters into worse and worse examples of humanity.  I pretty much didn't like any of the characters any more by the time this season was about halfway done.  Rose McGowan's short appearance was interesting, but short and overly dramatized storyline again.  I was glad when it was done that Christian would get to keep being his selfish, overindulgent self, and that Sean would get to go all idealistic like he tried for 6 seasons, but glad that I won't feel the morbid curiosity to watch either one of them in their endeavors again.
0756405890|1.0|What a yawn.  The cardboard hero is an unlikeable cliche, the minor characters aren't fleshed out at all, the plot offers no surprises and there's nothing compelling about the world Rothfuss creates.  Not the geography, language, names, legends...nothing.  Pick up any Terry Pratchett book and he offers more thought provoking ideas in about 10 pages compared with 500 odd pages of this dross.<br /><br />If you want a proper book, written for grownups, with a three-dimensional \\"super hero\\"out for revenge, try \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\".
0307472590|5.0|Great book
B000VM9Z8K|1.0|I couldn't even make it halfway through. The main character is so cowardly and a huge push-over that I got incredibly annoyed. Also, you begin to read the book with an English accent in your mind, which is equally annoying. Terrible.
1599218011|2.0|I really wanted to love this lifestyle, and had high hopes for this book. And yes, it is inspiring and engaging...BUT! Unless you have nothing else to do but devote yourself to this lifestyle or have a full-time shopper and chef on staff,  it is absolutely impossible to maintain. At least it is impossible for ME to maintain. I have no doubts that if you ARE able to devote yourself to this, it probably WILL improve your health. It is not an easy regimen for a busy professional however. A word about the recipes... There are ingredients present I have never even HEARD of...and if I haven't heard of them, I would have NO clue as to where to shop for them or even in which department they'd be...I can tell you this, though...they are NOT ingredients readily available at your local grocery store. All in all, I found the book depressing in that there was no way I could implement this program as a lifestyle change. If you can, more power to you.
B003FSTN6Q|5.0|I have loved this show from the beginning, and this season stood up to the previous standard set, imo.  It took a little while for me to catch on, and understand the whole \\"shinies\\" and \\"shadows\\" thing, but that was either the producers point, or because it had been so long since I watched season 4 that I forgot some details.    I was glad that I was finally able to see Jaime Kennedy as Eli, and not see him as Jaime Kennedy anymore, I think that his performance improved a lot, I was able to take his character a lot more seriously.  I also enjoyed that Delia was a lot more accepting of the goings-on, but still managed to maintain her hesitation about the involvement of her and her family.    The boy who played Melinda's son did a great job, he portrayed such innocence and and acceptance of the ghosts and other beings he saw, I almost could believe they are a part of his real life also.    I was disappointed that the series ended, but glad that it ended on such a bright note, with Aiden and the shinies winning against the shadows.
B000JCEVK4|5.0|The postmodern use of different musical styles in one song is nothing new.  This began, in large part, with the polystylistic influence of 20th century classical composers, most notably Alfred Schnittke.  Today, this technique is so pervasive that it's influence can be heard even in the most banal pop music.  Most of the time, the synthesis of differing styles in popular music falls woefully short of the works of genius that inspired this movement.  In a business cluttered with uninspired schlock, the Diablo Swing Orchestra stands out as a perfect realization of this technique.  Apart from their impeccable musicianship, what really impresses is the band's use of the aesthetic concept of \\"sign of place.\\"  The flow of the songs is not encumbered by the stylistic shifts.  Sometimes, these shifts are intentionally jarring.  Sometimes, they appear as fluidly and naturally as any in music.  Always, the shifts serve the overall form of the track (and of the album itself).  This is one of my all-time favorite albums (and I have a collection of over 700 on vinyl).  \\"The Butcher's Ballroom\\" is a masterpiece.  Some will find the music inaccessible.  Otherwise, I can't imagine anybody not liking this remarkable album.  Highly recommended.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|what a great insight to the world of a child!!! This book was amazing. I would recommend it to anyone!
B0026JWDQW|4.0|I first saw Paolo Nutini playing live at the Isle of Wite on the Paladia chanel and was blown away. He sang 'Jenny don't be hasty' which was off the album These Streets. This album shows that he is a genuine new talent with an old soul. Every time I hear 'Pencil full of lead' my feet start tapping immediately! The slower tunes are also good with thought out depth and contemplation. It's a great album and looking forward to more from Paolo in the future.
0679735909|1.0|Like other readers, I thought that I was going to enjoy this book because I thought that it would be like John Fowles'The French Lieutenants Woman.  However, in all honesty, I feel that this author used the vehicle to ramble on and on in order to display what she feels are great literary abilities.  This novel contains a great deal of poetry.  I have nothing against poetry, but non of the poetry is lovely or memorable.  If the poetry is not wonderful then the reader begins to wonder why is he wasting so much time reading about poets that do not really speak to him or her.  The two poets in the novel speak to each other, but are of very little interest to the reader.  The author appears to me to be very pretentious.  While the story line is interesting, the way that it is presented makes for a very boring read.  The  novel rambles on for 544 pages.  I think there was enough here for only 144 pages.  This is no French Lieutenant's Woman.  The author seems to want to prove how capable she is to the reader, but in doing so she looses her reader.  There is no passion in her writing, even though she attempts to write a passionate romance.  She attempts to appear intelectual while trying to write about passion.  It doesn't work!
B0024F08RO|3.0|This season just did not keep my interest the way previous seasons did.  I think it lasted one season too long, and they were grasping at ways to keep these people in trouble.  I never did understand what Scylla was, or why everyone wanted it so badly, and (warning, spoiler ahead) it was just disappointing that Scofield died so soon after everyone worked together to obtain their pardons.  Also, Bagwell should have been killed.  Not sent back to prison, just killed.  He was disgusting and offensive and annoying in every scene he was in, and the actor who played him did a FANTASTIC job of portraying a horrid example of humanity, because I have seen him in other roles and he was nothing like Bagwell.    but back to the show in general, the first few seasons were interesting, kept my attention, and I wanted them to WIN!  By this season, I kept having to back up to find out what had just happened bc it wasn't keeping my attention, and instead of wanting them to WIN I just wanted it to get done with.  The only reason I'm going to watch the Final Break is to find out (warning, spoiler ahead) how and when and why Scofield died.
0316069884|4.0|The book was great in the sense that it revealed the horrors of factory farming(as many other books have done so in the past). However, the book basically describes the horrors of factory farming and adds the viewpoints of a few people(Frank Reese, Niman, etc.). I feel it doesn't focus enough on the good aspect of animal farming(grass-fed, pastured, truly free-range, etc.) that are available from family farms. It merely mentions them, without providing much information about how to obtain them or the benefits of them. There was not nearly as much information regarding humane animal products as factory farmed animal products were mentioned. I don't believe that the whole picture is shown by Foer, but that may be because he chose to leave the information out or because he did not have any more information than he wrote. Overall, if you want to learn about the horrors of factory farming, I would recommend this or other books. If you want a book that goes into details about humane animal products, this is not your book.

B000XUBFE2|4.0|Some books are easily forgotten the minute you finish them.  Other books stick indelibly in your mind long after the pages have been turned.  The Book Thief is without question in the latter category.  I still am not sure how I feel about this book, but I mean that in a positive way, just as I did not know how I felt after reading Diary of a Young Girl or watching Platoon for the first time.  Man's inhumanity to man is an eternal theme, but one that always created many mixed and confusing emotions in me.    Needless to say, you will not forget this book.    Warning:  This does deal with some very adult, but important, themes that may disturb very young reader.
B001UV4XFQ|3.0|Not bashing the movie here, I loved the movie, it was my favorite of the 3 released so far.  They aimed it for an older audience in my opinion, and who could resist Jacob telling Edward that he (Jacob) is just hotter (than Edward)?      What I don't like is only having an option for a blu ray with no special features, or a blu ray disc with the dvd right on the same disc.  The whole point of having both formats is in case of damage, or to lend one to a friend and still be able to keep your copy...in my opinion it was a cheap out on the part of the manufacturer, seriously, how much more could it have cost to put them on separate discs?  I would have paid an extra buck to have blu ray and dvd separated from each other.  I just hope this isn't the start of a new trend in blu ray manufacture!    Or, put the special features on a simple blu ray release.  Honestly I don't much care about having dvd and blu ray, I bought it to get blu ray, and like having a dvd backup, but it isn't necessary.  But I'm certainly not going to pass on having special features.

0316066524|5.0|Hard to know what to say that hasn't been said already, so I'll simply say this: reading \\"Infinite Jest\\" is like spending days on end in the world's most erudite and hilarious amusement park.
B0026ZNL80|5.0|The first thing I will say about this album is that the production quality is excellent, which for me is extremely important. Nothing irritates me more than hearing really good music that is not mixed well in the studio (not too common these days, but I have a very critical ear.) Anyway, each insturment is crystal-clear and easy to pick out, yet the individual performances gel together very nicely.<br /><br />The music itself is very dynamic - a good blend of aggressive, punchy passages and a few softer, atmospheric moments. As mentioned previously, this latest release from Riverside is a little heavier than what we've heard in the past from these guys, but it's not overbearingly \\"METAL.\\" Many of the guitar parts are a little crunchier, with some cool sounding wah pedals and maybe a bit of phase shifting. Another new twist is the prominent use of organ sounds that really adds a little extra dimention. Each song is easy to listen to with some nice hooks and melodies, and yet it does not get boring. There are many changes in time & key signatures, and lots of interesting little details that makes you keep coming back. Many good albums need to heard several times before they can truly be appreciated. Not so with this one - it starts out good and just keeps getting better.<br /><br />Initially I was going to rate this album with 4 stars. But honestly, there's just not much to complain about here. If you like Riverside, or progressive rock in general you will like this album. If you're not familiar with progressive hard-rock & would like to expand your musical horizons, this album would be a good starting point.
B004G600A4|4.0|This was good, and our kids enjoyed it, but as an adult, it lacked the extra spark of Pixar movies or even some of the earlier Disney movies like Aladdin.  Some of the songs and jokes seemed tired and contrived, and the stepmother was a little too scary and creepy for my taste.
0393072231|5.0|incredibly well written and insightful.   challenging but accessible for those not in the business who really want a deeper understanding of what actually happened.   I feel like i have that now, and what I learned is hard to believe!
0439023491|5.0|I absolutely loved this book and the Hunger Games series as a whole.  Suzanne Collins has created characters that you love and characters that you love to hate. I had a very hard time setting this book down when I knew I had to go to sleep at night.  I just wanted to know more about what happens.  When I finished Catching Fire I had to run out and order Mockingjay right way.  I didn't want it to end.  I highly recommend this series to anyone and everyone, no matter what age you are, it's a great read!
0465043550|4.0|Mandelbrot's work provides a very interesting introduction to his ideas on, and critique of financial theory. The book is not mathematically rigorous at all and is primarily aimed at the broad market. The notes and bibliography section do provide a useful addendum to those who would wish to delve a little deeper into the subject. Mandelbrot's critique of investment theory will not really add anything new to the serious student of the field,but his overview and discussion of fractals and their applicability to the field is where the real interest lies in this book.     The author certainly tries his best to build and explain his views, But the balancing act between depth and broad accessibility is definitely an issue that the book struggles with. I do believe that if he had delved more into the complex mathematics of his theories he would lose the general reader, and he arguably does not go into enough depth to please the more experienced reader. In as complex a field as this, it is quite understandable how difficult a balancing act this is.     In general the book is recommended to students of finance looking for alternative approaches to and alternative theories of investment theory. It is a pleasing read that flows well and does not obfuscate the issue with too much complexity. Personally, I found that Mandelbrot comes across as quite humble and very willing to accept that he does not know everything, his acceptance that he may be wrong and that the field needs so much more challenging research was very pleasing to note. Mandelbrot's work adds another step in our understanding of the market, there are still so many unknowns, but his work certainly does advance the field and is therefore worth reading.

0061124265|4.0|I left this book with a strange sensation...a feeling that I had gained something, or won something back, which I had lost. I couldn't quite put my finger on it until a few moments passed. It was the appreciation and beauty of life. I decided to buy this book because I, too, had decided to die. Coming away from the book, most of my lingering thoughts have left...I don't want to dive into the personal, but I do recommend this book for anyone who might be feeling the pressures of leading a seemingly meaningless life.<br /><br />I was a bit put-off by the author's Vonnegutian interruption in the very beginning. I think we could have done without it; it did not make the story any better or any less. You forget he was even in the story by the time you read the next chapter.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|This is an outstanding cooler, particularly for the money.  It keeps my CPU at 12C idle, and 21C under load running BFBC2.  Impossible you say? Not according to my Asus AI Suite II sensor....<br /><br />As other reviewers point out, this unit is HUGE.  I bought it for a new build: Intel i7-2600k, ASUS P8P67-Pro, 8 GB G-Skill Ripjaw memory, Rosewill Blackhawk midtower case, Samsung SSD, Western Digital 7200 platter drive, and a soon-to-be-replaced EVGA 280 GTX. It will NOT fit in your old eMachines midtower, so don't try!<br /><br />Attention to detail requires a slow (deliberate) install with this one; you cannot just push pins and walk away.  The size and weight of this cooler mandate the use of a backplate and fortunately there is one.  You will need a cutout on the back of your motherboard tray, or you will have to remove an installed mobo to attach the backplate to the mobo under your CPU.  New builds are obviously no problem, but a number of reviewers have complained that it doesn't attach easily like the crappy stock coolers they got with their CPU's.  *Gosh*  Also, as one reviewer complained, the base does not lock this unit down to the CPU and it slides a little if pushed, potentially jeopardizing your already-crowded RAM. It won't move if it isn't pushed, however, and a reasonable amount of thermal paste (Arctic Silver for me as I don't trust the stuff that ships with these things) applied correctly will create enough of a gravity-defying vacuum to keep it in place when your computer is placed upright.  \\"Applied correctly,\\" you ask?  This is not your grandfather's CPU cooler; the direct-contact heat transfer pipes embedded in the cooler plate require application of the paste to the COOLER rather than the CPU, and you need to work that paste into the microgaps around the pipes in the base plate.  That differs from the way we've been doing things for the past twenty years.  Fortunately, even the poorly illustrated manual that came with this cooler demonstrates the correct application of paste (although at least one reviewer completely missed that).<br /><br />This thing is quiet, too.  AI Suite tells me its running at 672 RPM and I don't even hear it.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great cooler.  Don't buy it if your case is too small, your mobo is a microATX, you don't like backplates, you can't apply thermal grease correctly, or you're just generally impatient.  If you want outstanding cooling at a reasonable price, however, this is the best bang for your buck.<br /><br />*UPDATED*<br /><br />When I wrote the original review on February 3, 2011, I had not yet overclocked my Intel i7 2600k.

David Foster's narration and lead into each song just keeps you in front of the screen. This is something worth having for the special family days.
B000056BOR|4.0|This is yet another Doris Day movie, made during that fruitful period between \\"Pillow Talk\\" and \\"Send Me No Flowers\\", that broke with the established formula of 'Married to Garner/Chased By Hudson', whereas they found another well-known leading man to star with Do-Do other than her two perennials. Cary Grant, Mr. Charisma himself, stars as the romantic lead in a tale that would have MAYBE suited Hudson, since Grant chases her for most of the movie, (actually, they chase each other throughout the film, and Doris' ROOMMATE, played by Audrey Meadows, is the one who hates him before she realizes who he is, not Doris herself, who falls in love with him on first glance,) and they end up getting married in the end.<br /><br />It all starts when Grant, who plays a very well-heeled captain of industry, splashes unemployed working girl Doris one morning with his Rolls Royce Silver Cloud. He immediately feels a small pang of guilt and sends his man Friday, played by Gig Young, rather than Tony Randall, to apologize and make restitution for her soiled clothes. The Gig Young character is immediately met with protective hostility by the roommate, but he eventually does hook up with Do-Do, playing a character  named Cathy Timberlake, as she dines at a Horn & Hardart's Automat where her roomie works. She meets Grant, playing a Mr. Shayne, head of a large company that buys up other companies, and they proceed to charm the pants off of each other (almost!)<br /><br />There is one scene, as the movies develops, during their second trip to the Caribbean, where Doris resolves not to get nervous like she did on their first trip down there, (where she developed a comical nervous rash,) and proceeds to drink herself blotto. Grant drops everything to be there with her, and finds her lying on their fourposter soused to the gills, with a whiskey bottle hanging off of her right big toe. Doris greets him with a shrill, drunken \\"Hi!\\" and waves at him with the whiskey bottle-ensconced big toe. It has to be one of the funniest scenes in rom-com history.<br /><br />It's little touches like that that made Doris' movies between 1959 and 1963 so great! Some of the best writing, acting and directing in film comedy was employed during these movies, making them classics of family entertainment and we may never see their like again....and you can rest assured that every present-day rom-com that DOES work is probably utilizing a rethink of any number of gags used in Doris' better movies from this period in her career.<br /><br />She was the most profitable film actress during this era for SOME reason, and trust me, it's easy to see why!f the funniest scenes in rom-com history.

1401324029|4.0|This book starts quickly and keeps going to the last page.  There are times when the author jumps around like TV scenes, but they don't retract from the overall experience.  (I told myself to leave the character name referencing alone - and get over it.)  I TRULY appreciated the chapter about Nikki being duct taped to a chair!  I had almost completely forgotten about that episode from the show!    I am actually looking forward to the next installment.
1591841666|1.0|I expected a lot more from this book.  I ended up receiving some common sense advice that I already know. The title implies that this book will teach you when to quit and when to stick with something by visualizing a dip, a cul-de-sac and a cliff.  The idea is that you should consider when to work through a dip but you should quit when you hit a cul-de-sac or cliff if you can't turn them into dips because they are dead ends and they lead to nowhere.<br /><br />I'm 27 and I already know when it's time to cut my losses and move on and when it is worth sticking with something because the end result will be beneficial to me. I think most of you might already know this too. I think you figure this out as you get older with experience. I was hoping this book would teach me something beyond that.<br /><br />I could not find any rhythm in this small book and I didn't come away from it with any new advice or insights. Godin also keeps talking about being #1. He says to quit if you can't become #1.  I mean, we all want to be #1 but sometimes you don't have to be #1 to be satisfied or successful. I didn't get where he was going with quitting as it relates to being #1. This idea probably only applies to certain areas where being #1 means survival. Personally, I want to go to med school and become a doctor. I am not going to quit just because I can't find a cure for cancer.<br /><br />On page 64, there is a quote that pretty much sums up the whole book.  It says: \\"Never quit something with great long-term potential because you can't deal with the stress of the moment.\\" That pretty much sums up the book and the idea of dips and cul-de-sac's. I would have given this book five stars if it could explain how to differentiate between things worth quitting and things worth sticking with.<br /><br />This book could have benefited from more examples of real life dips and HOW and if you should go through them.  For example, Godin talks about how organic chemistry is a dip for pre-med students. His explanation of this dip is that if you don't get through organic chemistry, you will not go to medical school.  As a pre-med student, I already know this.  It would have been nice if Godin explained when it is worth sticking with orgo and when you should give up on it and pursue something else.  He just makes a pretty obvious observation and then leaves you hanging with no explanation.<br /><br />Also, unless I missed something, the book also never explained how to turn a cul-de-sac into a dip.<br /><br />Bottom line is this: Dips are natural, we all experience different dips in our lives. Some dips turn into cul-de-sacs and cliffs and vice-versa. Some dips however, are worth the effort of sticking out because of the potential end result.  This is not a new idea. You already know this and you get better at evaluating this as you get older with experience; I don't think somebody else can explain the dips in your own life. Dealing with the dips in your life has to do with your motivation. If you are a highly motivated individual, you will understand dips better than someone who is unmotivated. Since I think dips are related to motivation and understanding a dip is common sense, I suggest you skip this book and by any one of the many self-help motivational titles out there.<br /><br />Seth Godin is a pretty popular guy so I'm surprised that I didn't like this book.  I would suggest you borrow it first but there's really nothing groundbreaking here and the book was a slow read. I know one star is pretty harsh but considering the price and what you will come away with after reading it, I thought it was appropriate.t if you don't get through organic chemistry, you will not go to medical school.

B000P0J09M|1.0|This DVD is letterboxed not widescreen.  When you play it on a new HD LED TV is displays with black bars all around...REALLY ANNOYING!!! And the transfer sucks big time, as well. The quality of the picture sucks...Aaauuuggghhh! What a waste of money!
1401323820|3.0|I truly enjoyed the way the publisher took advantage of the series when doing the book.  It was fun and made me smile from the forward to the back cover text.  (I kind of wish the ABC logo wasn't on the hardcover dust jacket...  but I'm wierd that way.)    Overall, I liked it.  But, I found it hard to get through the first half of the book.  Common writer flaws like pushing too much back-story onto the reader at inopportune times.  I know that most of us had already watched the show, so we come into this with background knowledge - but I also wanted the book to stand on its own.  Luckily, I was easily swept away in the last half.  Before I knew it, I had finished it and was craving the next one.  The action picks you up and sweeps you off into a world that is both familiar and original.    Thank you Richard Castle - for a taste of something different.  I'm normally a sci-fi/fantasy/horror reader, but maybe there's room in there for crime/mysteries.
0061726826|5.0|*reviewed my MM's (Katie) -<br /><br />Warning: while reading this book you may experience severe reactions to amor deliria nervosa, also known as falling in love, something that's \\"cured\\" aka banned in Delirium's society. Side effects may include sleepless nights while reading Delirium, the inability to concentrate on anything else but reading this book, nervousness over what's going to happen to Lena & Alex, having your heart ripped out, sighing, finding yourself sitting on the edge of your seat, kissing your book, running out to pre-order PANDEMONIUM, petting the new beautiful cover, telling all your friends to go pick up this book, and of course falling helplessly in love with the brilliant, and breathtakingly beautiful writing of Lauren Oliver.<br /><br />Can you imagine living in a society where LOVE is a disease?! I seriously loved the way Lauren created a fascinating society that \\"cures\\" love. Yes it may seem hilarious, but when you read DELIRIUM it totally makes sense. Lauren's writing is just awesome! It's richly detailed, it's poetic, captivating and I love that she really makes me think. Lauren is truly a gifted writer and I swear she could write a story about the most outlandish thing and make it credible. Here's a taste of Lauren's beautiful prose, which is also one of my favorite quotes from DELIRIUM:<br /><br />Sometimes I feel like if you just watch things, just sit still and let the world exist in front of you- sometimes I swear that just for a second time freezes and the world pauses in it's tilt. Just for a second. And if you somehow found a way to live in that second, then you would live forever. - pg 153<br /><br />This is one of the many reasons why I adored Lena, the story's main protagonist. She's insightful and I admired the way she fights to believe in something she's grown up being taught vs something that's right in front of her face telling her otherwise. I love a character who has a quest for finding the truth, no matter how heartbreaking that truth can be and how much they'll have to sacrifice in order to get it. Alex is a character I immediately loved. He challenges everything that Lena has been taught. I love the way in which he makes her think and helps her open her eyes to the truth around her. I of course loved the way their relationship developed over the course of the book.<br /><br />I'm surprised at how much I loved this book considering there isn't a lot of action, there's no paranormal characters and the characters aren't as in-depth as I usually like them. What a beautiful change of pace this book is for me! This is a book that completely snuck up on me and swept me off my feet with it's beautiful writing style, romantic story line, and it's well developed characters. Oh Lauren Oliver the things you did to my heart in this book..... Luckily my heart won't be ripped out for long as I'm off to drown my broken heart in PANDEMONIUM. Seriously, if you haven't already go PICK UP DELIRIUM! You'll enjoy every moment experiencing the side effects of amor deliria nervosa while reading Lena's story. There is very mild language in this book.<br /><br />** Reviewed by Sophie for Mundie Moms-<br /><br />Love. Stories, poems, films, songs have been created in an attempt to explain the concept. But imagine growing up in the United States where love didn't exist. I saw you blink slowly as you read that last sentence. What if there was a cure for love? I know what you're thinking -- no thanks, I don't want it. But what if the government made you take it when you turned eighteen? There would be less divorce, less violence, less reliance upon pharmaceuticals, less addiction. You get the idea.<br /><br />Lauren creates such a world and introduces us to her protagonist, Lena, who is just a few months from taking the cure. In these last weeks, she thinks a lot about what life will be like for her after the cure. All around her, we see the effects of cured family members and friends. They're happy with their lives and go on with their daily activities with a predicatble rhythm. But is this what Lena wants? As Lena and her best friend, Hana, begin to question some of the government teachings and rules, the reader discovers how far the government has gone to eradicate the concept, feeling and existence of love.<br /><br />I have to admit to sitting back and admiring the absolute plausibility of such a concept. The excerpts of government approved literature at the start of each chapter set the tone for what Lena and Hana have learned all of their lives. As a reader, you can't help feeling sympathetic for them. This level of propoganda is all they know. It is their truth. And then the reality of the horror unfolds as you find out what happens to those who do fall in love and are caught.<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of well-written dystopian stories and Lauren has penned one that rings true and shakes our most sacred belief system. To top it off, her prose is so lyrical, at times, that yes, I paused to text KatieB and even call her to read a few sentences out loud. I am thrilled that this will be a trilogy and that the movie rights have been optioned.<br /><br />If you enjoy a love story where love is truly forbidden, pick up DELIRIUM on February 1st. You will realize that a unifying, maddening and unpredictable concept like love will remain even when threatened. It'll be that loose thread in a tightly woven fabric and the temptation to pull it will be overwhelming. So what would happen if you did fall in love in such a society? I know, I'm still thinking about it.<br /><br />A quick aside for those Mundie Moms who will ask me -- but is there romance? I will confess that there is a multiple-page Kissy Scene that I may have read more than once. And there is...Alex.

B001R4CKGU|2.0|The writing was at times very vivid and lively, but overall this thing was a snooze to read.  It did little else but explore the emotional contours of a fading way of life.  Interesting for a short story perhaps, but not for a novel.  I didn't finish it.
0891419063|5.0|With the Old Breed by E.B. Sledge<br />This book is rated at almost FIVE STARS with over 400 ratings. I am not sure what I say<br />can matter if that doesn't convince you this book is a must read. Nonetheless, I will<br />try to explain from the common man's point of view why this book is a page turner.<br />I usually list the 2 best things and the 2 worst things about the book and I will<br />continue that here.<br /><br />The Best part about this book<br />1) It was written completely by someone who was at the war. THis is his experiance<br />without the bigger picture reference or that attempt to convey anything else but his<br />view of a war that everyone has heard about but few know details about. He allows the<br />reader to experiance it thru his eyes and he does it as if the reader is a good friend<br />so he pulls no punches.<br /><br />2) He tells the story with little emphasis on how he felt about things afterwards. As an<br />avid reader of history books, I usually prefer the ones that are first person to get a<br />feel for the war and then the broad analyzing books for a look at the strategy. I am not<br />a fan of the 1st person books that get side tracked by a interjecting of the authors<br />opinion of the strategy. It seems to take away from the 1st person feel of the book. I<br />tell you that to tell you this, With the Old Breed has non-of that. It is a straight<br />shoiting book about what it was like to fight in the island hopping campaigns of the<br />Pacific. Even the debate of the Peleliu battle is addreessed by simply stating it is a<br />point of disagreement. Sledgehammer (EB Sledge's nickname) never gives his opinion, only<br />his experiance. I respect that.<br /><br />Now the Worst part of the book<br /><br />1) It ended. Seriously, the worst part of the book was that it was over. I felt like I<br />had just started it when it was over. I wish he had written more about certain times<br />like on his trip form the US to the war aboard the ship. This time period received few<br />pages, while I appriciated what it did say, I wished this topic and others were explored<br />more deeply.<br /><br />2) The one thing that did make me want to skip some pages was when the mundand details<br />dragged on every now and then. This only happened a few times and it is to the credit of<br />the author that this is the only thing I could say was remotely negative about the book.<br />This book is really a classic piece on the Pacific Campaign thru the eyes of a frontline<br />combat soldier.this topic and others were explored   more deeply.    2) The one thing that did make me want to skip some pages was when the mundand details   dragged on every now and then.

B003ZEY0F4|5.0|Amazon doesn't seem to be separating these reviews, but this review is for the Blu-ray box set of all three films from Alliance.<br /><br />At roughly $15 a pop for each film, it was well worth the purchase.<br /><br />The basics: the transfers are in 1080i, not 1080p, but my player converts it to 1080p at 60Mhz anyway, as I'm sure most players will. Regardless of the 1080i, the transfer on all three films is very strong and certainly the best quality currently out there. The colors are nice and vibrant without overpowering the scenes, and some shots are very striking in their detail, especially if all you've seen are the regular DVDs. The first film looks like an entirely new movie thanks to the transfer, especially considering it was never even released in anamorphic widescreen. Certain shots were very surprising, most notably Tatum's scene in the garage--the Ghostface costume looks very glittery and sparkles on the screen, which is something that caught my eye immediately. It's as if the killer has rolled around in glitter. I never noticed it before.<br /><br />The soundtrack is fine for all I can tell, but I don't have a surround system, just my TV speakers.<br /><br />The films are all presented in their original 'R' rated versions--no cuts.<br /><br />There are no extras whatsoever, so that may be disappointing to some. However, I personally don't watch the extras on my movies anyway.<br /><br />The real issue here was the packaging. Despite being very nice to look at (the outer sleeve slides off much like a TV box set, and it's a cool blue color), \\"Scream 2\\" and 3 were incredibly hard to remove from the packaging. On one hand, it's nice they're secure for shipping, but man I had to practically break the things to get them out. \\"Scream\\" is on the other side of the \\"book\\" (it flips open) and I had no issues removing it, but I had hell with parts 2 and 3. I didn't even put them back in the case after removing them, I stuck them in separate DVD cases to avoid going through that crap again.<br /><br />All in all, I cannot imagine any future release looking much better than this. There is some -slight- grain in a few scenes throughout the films, but the image is so sharp and crisp it honestly didn't bother me. I would say the quality is pretty excellent and I was very satisfied. They looked like new films.<br /><br />If you are tired of waiting for the U.S. to release these films on Blu-ray and don't mind the lack of extras, you can't go wrong picking this up. The films look great, and at $15 a pop they're a bargain. And unless the U.S. release is something amazing, I cannot imagine they would look much better.ng through that crap again.<br /><br />All in all, I cannot imagine any future release looking much better than this.

Captured by smugglers who deal in female flesh, she's taken on a hazardous journey by boat, truck and camel into the dark heart of Africa. Spanked and humiliated in every conceivable way she's saved by the Sheik, becoming the perfect concubine in the Red Fort. Sold to slave traders by the Sheikh's father, the young Arab sets off across the Sahara to save the Girl before she can be sold to a cult that practises human sacrifice.   Beautifully illustrated by Chloe's sterling prose, the descriptions of The Girl's journey are as eye-opening as The Girl's erotic adventures are steamy. Chole continues to please and amaze with each new novel. All any reader can ever ask for is ...More!

B001PB3RU8|5.0|I ADORE Lungs. First let me say that I feel like I've been hopelessly drowning in a pool of distasteful music that for some reason beyond me can make the top 40 charts. The music today is rapidly declining into the unbareable noise section.   Now I'm all about catchy tunes, I listen to Lady Gaga. I'm into hard rock too. So I was a little surprised when I realized how much I love Florence Welch. When I first heard her I thought she was just another Indie artist that I won't ever listen to. And then I kept hearing her on the alternative radio station and I just fell in love.   I got this album and have been listening to it for months. I can't go a day without listening to it. For some people it might take a few listens to really like it, but it's such a great album. There are only about 3 songs I don't care for, but that is pretty wonderful for me, I tend to only like about 1/3 of songs on albums from bands I like.   Florence has such a striking voice and she uses it wisely. She strays away from the typical lyrics we hear all the time and likes to tell stories. She mixes pop, rock, soul, and indie all into one. She plays with tempos and she can belt out a lyric like you wouldn't believe. You wouldn't think she's only 24. And I love the use of the harp on this album. It adds such a classy touch.   I recommend this album to anyone, especially if you're looking for a refreshing change to the contemporary pop that they play nowadays. I'm 19 and even I can't stand the top 40. And I know you'll like this album more if you listen to the whole songs and not just 30 second clips, it doesn't do the album justice. And I highly suggest that after you listen and buy this album you download her single \\"Heavy in Your Arms\\". It is one of the greatest songs EVER. It was a song that really caught my attention and made me look deeper into Florence and the Machine. You can find it on the Twilight Saga Eclipse Soundtrack I believe.
B0042816YK|1.0|I'll admit: I can't give a Short Attention Span Summary because I couldn't make it through the whole film. Who knew that a single woman finding herself while backpacking could fill up so much space or make such an intensely boring movie?<br /><br />Save your money.
B0034G4P7Q|5.0|I personally wanted to see this movie not because of the subject matter, but because of the cast and crew behind it. When I heard Aaron Sorkin, esteemed writer of The West Wing, was going to be writing this, I was so excited. And Kevin Spacey as a producer? Count me in. At the time Jesse Eisenberg was in the back of my mind. I'd seen him in Adventureland and Zombieland, and thought he was hilarious, but that was it. He never struck me as a \\"serious\\" actor. It wasn't until shortly before the release of The Social Network that I realized he'd been in several serious films, and was extremely talented. Needless to say, he blew me away with his portrayal of a seriously flawed genius in this film. I didn't even know who Andrew Garfield or Armie Hammer were. I love it when unknown actors shine in films like this.<br /><br />Sorkin's script was phenomenal just as I knew it would be, and the acting was top notch - I was even impressed with Timberlake's cheeky portrayal of Sean Parker. The pacing and timing was impeccable. David Fincher certainly deserved his Golden Globe.<br /><br />Overall, if you're looking for a movie to really enjoy through and through, watch The Social Network. It's alternately hilarious, tragic, introspective, clever, and frustrating. Fantastic.
B003L20IFQ|1.0|If I can give this movie -100 stars, I will. I have seen some pretty bad movies, but this one actually makes me angry. Who would spend the money and energy to write and produce some garbage like this! This entire movie is a disguise to shove some political ideal down your throat. I feel like that I had just spent the last an hour and a half listening to a time-share condo's sale pitch. When I got the movie, I was all psyched. A guy is buried with nothing other than a cell phone and lighter, now has to figure out where he is and get himself out, how smart is that! There is nothing smart about this movie, or good for that matter. It may not come as a surprise to a lot of people that Ryan Reynolds is not a good actor. He was over acting in every scene, which made the entire exercise in stupidity even worse. Oh, man, I need something that makes me forget this movie asap.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|I was looking for something very special for my very special brother-in-law for his birthday. I became so smitten by it immediately after seeing the video Stand By Me that I ordered it right then. As we live 150 miles away, it was a few weeks before I got down to his house and actually saw the whole thing. Every single thing is GOLDEN! I would however recommend that you do as I did and purchase the set w/ DVD and CD. Once you've seen the DVD, each song will then be better appreciated. I think there is just a slight possibility if you didn't watch the video first this might not be a CD to be appreciated in the player, say on a road trip. Some of the appreciation for the sound comes from knowing and recognizing the lengths this producer went to to get the sounds he did. This is so finely tuned that it is 'love at first sight/sound!!! Musical art at it's finest.
B0034G4OZE|2.0|Before I get into synopsizing this film, let me point out some of the things that were COMPLETELY FALSE with respect to mental hospitals (but were shown in this film as true).<br /><br />1. Mental wards are *locked* facilities. You can't just &#34;sneak out,&#34; because every single door is locked.<br />2. Psychiatrists don't sit and listen to patients talk about their fears/dreams/ hopes/ childhood. They want to know what are the symptoms of the patient so that they can medicate him and get him out to make room for the next patient.<br />3. Psychiatrists DON'T act like the doctor in this movie, because the relationship is not meant to be a friendship. It is meant to be a therapeutic relationship, and so any single thing that might offer insight into the personality of a psychiatrist is something that s/he will scrupulously avoid revealing in any way.<br />4. Visiting hours in psych wards are limited. People can't just randomly walk in off the street at any time of day.<br />5. There are no parties in psych wards, nor are people allowed to just call in a pizza delivery from a ward.<br />6. People do not stay there until they can get their lives sorted out. They stay there until they are stabilized (and sometimes not even that long). If it were any different, you wouldn't see so many bums (with obvious mental problems) on the street.<br />7. You need to put coins in the phone to use it anywhere in the world.<br />8. Doctors or nurses will NEVER discuss the personal details of one patient with another patient. (If a patient asks a doctor &#34;What's wrong with that guy?&#34; the doctor will never just come out with &#34;Oh, he's schizophrenic&#34;-- even if the patient in question is frankly crazy/ schizophrenic.)<br /><br />Short Attention Span Summary:<br /><br />1. A young (if melodramatic) boy decides that he is having some sort of existential crisis.<br />2. He checks himself into a hospital, and finds that his problems are actually much less severe than those of most of the other inhabitants.<br />3. The protagonist finds not one but two women. (It seems that he had to go to the psych ward to become a pimp.)<br />4. Almost everything is (predictably) wrapped up by the end of the 5th day (the way that it should be in a good little bildungsroman).<br /><br />This movie did have a few funny/ witty moments, and my overall impression of it could have been better it didn't cause me so much cognitive dissonance by presenting so many false impressions of psych wards.two women.

B001W79MBI|5.0|A friend of mine showed this movie to me on a whim, saying that it was amongst the best anime films she'd ever seen.  I scoffed at the time...but boy, was she right!    I was so impressed by the level of realism (my god, when they cut someone they actually bleed) and character development.  True, this isn't some original, amazing plotline, but it's set up in a way that feels real and visceral.  You care about the characters, and you see and feel their struggles in their facial expressions and body language.      The soundtrack is also utterly amazing.  I bought it separately and listen to it often.  It's a very moving score.    All in all?  Give it a try.  This one isn't for kids, but as an adult you appreciate it!
0143034901|5.0|This is one of the most beautifully written books I've ever read. I hung on every word and did not want it to end. I would give this book six stars if they were available.<br /><br />Andrea Walker ~ freelance writer

B004HWYTP4|3.0|Short Attention Span Summary:<br /><br />1. Spy is in love with a girl.<br />2. Bad Guys from government want to kill the protagonist.<br />3. Spy rounds up a bunch of ex spy friends to uncover the plot.<br />4. Spy kidnaps Vice President and forces him to admit the plot.<br />5. Spy leaves with girl, and another romance between two other characters is rekindled.<br /><br />The fact that this plot was so implausible didn't bother me all that much (after all, that's why it's a movie). And there is a limit to how bad anything Morgan Freeman is in can be. But on the other hand, the characters in this movie just weren't well developed. What is quite the word for when<br />a bunch of first class actors are thrown together in something that is supposed to be funny (but somehow misses the mark)? I could have used a bit more time developing the relationship between the Bruce Willis protagonist and his love interest.<br />I would not buy this movie new. Some of the things just came out of nowhere, and I got the impression that they were just lashed onto the end to make the whole thing work. It will be on the second hand shelf soon enough (or at the dollar store).
B003YWUTKM|1.0|I have long enjoyed The Orb and David Gilmour at their best.   Both artists are, though, quite capable of displays of mediocrity.   I had hoped this album would be a merging of great talents. Sadly, not to be.  It sounds like Gilmour was doing a bit of idle noodling. Alex Paterson has evidently decided he'd fiddle about with this on his computer and hey presto! out pops a piece of lengthy, aimless and uninspired tediousness.   Hopelessly dull.
0452287022|4.0|Ever wonder what lies behind the art?  Curious about the person made famous by the piece?  How does the artist, or the model, see the world, people, or fragments of it therein, differently from the rest of us? Tracy Chevalier offers possible answers to questions like these as she explores the world of the painter Vermeer's Girl with a Pearl Earring then creates her novel of the same name.<br /> At the age of sixteen, Griet is forced by financial circumstances to work as a maid in the home of Vermeer.  Set in seventeenth century Delft, Holland, the book opens with the scene in which she is hired.  Griet is slicing carrots, leeks and cabbage in her mother's kitchen, and as she slices, she arranges the vegetables in a symmetrical pattern before tossing them into the pot.  Her play with colors and shapes does not escape the artist's notice when Griet's mother brings Vermeer and his wife into the kitchen to see her.  Nervous, Griet tells a small lie. She learns she is to start the next day and will have to live with the Vermeer family in another part of the village.  Not happy about the turn of events, she is a product of the seventeenth century culture, nonetheless, and resigns herself to her station in life.<br /> Chevalier paints a vivid picture of the village as Griet walks along the canal through the market square to a section of town she has never visited, Papists' Corner, and to her new employer's home.  On her arrival, she is met by his four daughters (one of whom will become her nemesis) and a small son.  As the older housekeeper shows Griet around and explains her responsibilities, the reader begins to understand the difficulty of simple living during those times and how much work it took to maintain a household.  Griet's biggest duty will be the laundry for the entire family although her most important chore is to clean the master's studio (without moving anything). She will also help with shopping, cooking and cleaning, enough to make the most industrious individual weary.<br />  An innocent, unwilling but resigned intruder into the household, Griet endures the focus of jealousy and mischief and sometimes suffers the role of scapegoat with grace as she attempts to maintain a low profile.  She handles the challenges well for a girl of sixteen even though at times her life seems near futile - until she is drawn in to help the painter, her master.<br /> She studies his work area carefully, measuring, lifting and cleaning items, then replacing them with precision.  She observes the light in his studio, the windows, and where his model will sit or stand.  Aware of her perception, Vermeer questions her just enough to make her notice even more.  Soon she is helping him mix the paints and drawn further into the world of the artist. Her closeness to the master does not go unnoticed by the household and she treads the fine line of her position precariously.  Reluctantly, she is manipulated into becoming the model and the tension increases as the crux of the matter becomes the pearl earring.<br /> An enjoyable aspect of the story is that we can look at an image of the painting at any time and know exactly what our protagonist looks like. Chevalier works in enough art history and technique and local culture to create a believable story. Her antagonists are properly irritating and unlikable enough to make the reader cheer for Griet when things go well.  In a remarkable way, Chevalier interprets the painting itself.  She justifies the sadness in the model's expressive eyes.  Likewise she implies the hopefulness of youth to the smile that plays at the corner of the model's mouth. She explains the unusual head covering with solid, plausible insight into the character.  The pearl comes alive with symbolism and metaphorical purpose. Not only is the novel difficult to put down, the girl wearing the pearl earring lives.

1400052173|5.0|During the 20th century the lifespan of humans has increased significantly due, mainly, to advances in biomedical research. Over the years there has been an ongoing debate over ethical norms for the conduct of biomedical research; increasingly tissue rights activists, ethicists, lawyers, doctors and patients are insisting on the clarification of ethical norms, and the clarification/enforcement of ethical standards so as to promote moral/social values, et al. Specifically, for example, bioethical standards require that the participation of human subjects in biomedical research experiments be on a voluntary basis and that subjects be informed of the risks associated with the research. In the book titled, \\"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks\\", Skloot reveals that despite the many major benefits afforded society by biomedical research, there have been a number of shocking cases throughout history wherein bioethical standards have been violated; the revelation of each such case refuels the debate over bioethical norms, and increases the demand for the definition and enforcement of bioethical standards.     This biographical/bioethical book by Skloot (who earned a degree in biology before gravitating towards writing) really tells two stories in one: (1) it re-creates the life of Henrietta Lacks, herself, with the help of her family (mainly, her daughter Deborah), friends and neighbors; and (2) it relates the story of Henrietta Lacks' `immortal cells (aka, HeLa). Henrietta Lacks was an African American woman who was raised in the segregated south during the first half of the 20th century. In 1951 she was treated for cervical cancer in the ward for \\"colored\\" women at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. During her surgery the doctors harvested samples of both her cancer cells and her healthy cells, without her knowledge or consent, to be used for medical research. (According to Skloot, during the Jim Crow era doctors often used patients from the public wards---all of whom were poor, and most of whom happened to be black---for research without their knowledge; this practice supposedly was a form of repayment for `free' medical services.). In the laboratory, as expected, the healthy cells died after a relatively short period of time. However, miraculously, the cancer cells survived and continued to grow at an astonishing rate. This represented a breakthrough in medical research; up until that time, all cells (healthy or cancerous) would die out in cell culture. Although Henrietta Lacks eventually died from her cancer in 1951, her cells (subsequently named HeLa cells) have become `immortal'.     HeLa cells are mass produced for commercial use and have launched a multi-billion dollar industry. HeLa cells have facilitated most of the medical research advances since the 1950s, related to such diseases as polio, cancer, hemophilia, AIDS, etc. Skloot states, \\"Like guinea pigs and mice, Henrietta's cells have become the standard workhorse\\". Notwithstanding the success of biomedical research derived from HeLa cells, for decades following Henrietta Lacks' death her family members were not informed about their existence or their enormous contribution to the field of medicine. Moreover, none of the large profits reaped from the commercial use of HeLa cells have reached the Lacks family.  According to Skloot, HeLa cells represent one of the greatest biomedical discoveries of the 20th century; yet, despite the enormous benefits that they have afforded society, their use remains shrouded in controversy.     Skloot infers that, while it would have been considered unethical (in terms of today's ethics code) for doctors to take Henrietta Lacks' cells without her informed consent, it was not illegal. Notwithstanding, I was surprised to learn that even as of the time when this book went to press (2009) it was still not illegal for doctors to take a person's cells without his/her knowledge.     What about the case wherein a doctor takes a person's tissue with the patient's informed consent, and then stores this tissue to be used later for research purposes; is this legal and/or ethical? According to Skloot, if the doctor intends to gather tissue specifically for research purposes, (s)he is legally required to obtain the patient's informed consent. However, if the doctor stores tissue obtained during diagnostic procedures (e.g., the removal of a mole, et al) this is not illegal and, indeed, is a common occurrence. In fact, most Americans (of all races) currently have their tissue (e.g., moles, appendices, ovaries, fat, placentas, blood, et al.) stored on file somewhere. Moreover, according to Skloot, since the late sixties, it is mandatory for blood samples to be taken from most infants born in the United States to facilitate screening of newborns for genetic diseases. And, even though the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects requires informed consent for all human-subject research, most of this research isn't covered by this regulation because it is not federally funded, etc. In fact, according to Skloot, most of the aforementioned stored human tissue is, indeed, available to support tissue research on a massive and growing scale. While human tissue research is indispensible to making diagnostic/therapeutic medical advances (e.g., tests for various diseases, sundry vaccines, various prescription drugs, etc.) which greatly benefit society, it raises the `ethical' question as to whether the original donors are entitled to share in the huge profits derived from the commercialization of their tissues, and research derived from their tissues. Do donors own their tissue once it has been removed from their bodies? The debate over the commercialization of human biological material is likely to go on as long as we are a market-driven society.     Biomedical research has afforded society longer lives and improved health; and it has reduced the cost of illness. Despite these major benefits, according to Skloot, there have been a number of shocking cases in history wherein bioethical standards have been violated. One of the most shocking cases is that of Henrietta Lacks, whose cells were harvested without her knowledge, and have since been commercialized for large profits, while her family has not been allowed to share in these profits. The revelation of Henrietta Lacks' case, via Skloot's excellent book, is likely to refuel the debate over bioethical norms, and to increase the demand (by tissue rights activists, ethicists, lawyers, doctors and patients) for the definition, clarification, and enforcement of bioethical standards.     Clearly, the demand for medical research is likely to continue into the foreseeable future. There are so many diseases/maladies that are yet to be conquered, such as Alzheimer's disease, cancer, HIV/AIDS, Parkinson's, diabetes, mental disorders, stroke, heart disease, arthritis, and other intractable diseases; society stands to benefit greatly from the conquest of these diseases/maladies. At the same time, it is critical that human tissue research be conducted in a socially responsible manner; a public discussion of the ethical, legal, and social implications of biomedical research is sorely needed.     \\"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks\\" is an excellent, eye-opening, provocative book. Skloot manages to make a technical subject read like a thriller. Her presentation of the key issues related to biomedical research using human tissues is both effective and persuasive. The book is well-referenced and has been intensely fact-checked. I think that everyone should read this book at least once.
B003Y5H4SY|5.0|First, I should say that I went into this movie with extremely low expectations.  I knew it was a Shyamalan story, which didn't deter me because I think he gets some unnecessarily bad reviews.  The director didn't light any fires for me, either, but his previous offerings weren't garbage. However- a movie about people trapped in an elevator with the devil???  It sounded more like an indie short slasher film to me, and not a very original or good one, at that.  Nothing could be further from the truth.    I won't go into a plot review or pump it up, because I think it's good to keep expectations low on this one.  I gave it five stars not because it will win any awards, but because it is a thoughtful, thought-provoking, well-crafted story.  From a film perspective, it is shot and acted above par, and it has good pacing.  You're stuck in the elevator just long enough to start feeling a little claustrophobic before it cuts to an outside scene.  It is deliberate, and I always appreciate that in a movie.  Too many flicks just try to throw in as much action and special effects as possible without really paying attention to what they are doing or the effect it has on the viewer/audience.  The violence isn't gory or overdone.  In fact, you never actually witness the violence take place.  This is NOT a horror film or a slasher film.  It is very much in the style of a Hitchcock thriller.  It's just plain fun from beginning to end, and I felt it was the best money I had spent in a while when the movie was over.  I also felt uncharacteristically optimistic about people and life in general.    I've never taken the time to review a movie on here.  The fact that I thought this one was good enough to be my first should say something, and I'm extremely picky when it comes to movies.

B002VECM6S|5.0|I don't care to look at movies over and over again.  Most of the time, once is enough for me.  My in-laws don't look at movies at all, unless it is one that they come across on television.  And my father inlaw is not a movie lover at all, but let me tell you - I watched the Blind Side on a movie channel, then I purchased the Blind Side.  After reviewing it again, my husband took the movie to his parents house and they watched it.  Then I had to purchased another copy because they decided to \\"keep\\" that one and watch it with some friends.  I really enjoyed this movie, because is showed me alot about people and no matter where you come from, what you look like or what you are capable of doing, remember you are someone that can do anything.  I would recommend this movie to all ages.  This is one movie that eveyone should see and see what kind of differnece it would make in the world today.  My hats off to the producers, writers and the family that allowed the production of their life story.  Remember that inside everyone is the same and maybe if we all had more \\"guts\\" to take on life's most daring challngers, we, too could make this a better society.

B004AHNIGM|2.0|I was quite excited to hear that Gregg Allman was putting out another album. I really enjoy The Allman Brothers Band and have liked several of the cuts from his solo projects.    However, after several listens, I am sorry to say that I am disappointed with this album. Originally, I thought there was something wrong with my speakers or stereo, but, after a while, it became apparent that it was how it was produced. To my ears, it is muddy and distant not unlike old blues albums....again, not my taste.    I have always found his vocal to be the highlight as he wails through a good, juicy blues or rock song. Seems to me, you would want it to be as clear as possible to feel his emotion.    In reading the other reviews, some (even some of the high ratings) complain about this as well but then others laud the album as \\"his best\\", \\"outstanding\\" and \\"earthy, deep blues\\". So be it....a matter of taste.    In the past, I have cherry-picked songs I liked from his albums to add to other blues compilations. So, if you would like to explore previous Gregg Allman tunes but don't like this project, consider these recommendations:    Best Album: Before the Bullets Fly (most cuts)    Best of other cuts: House of Blues, Rendevous with the Blues, Love the Poison, Wolf's a-Howlin', Come Back and Help Me (Searching for Simplicity); Queen of Hearts, Midnight Rider, Please Call Home (Laid Back); Sweet Feelin' (Playin' Up a Storm); I'm No Angel (same album title); Turn On Your Lovelight (his Tour album).    Of course, you can hear some outstanding Gregg Allman vocals on several Allman Brother Band albums. My favorite albums are Live at Fillmore and Hittin' the Note.
B004D7GU3C|2.0|Que Paso...? This has got to be Ricky's worst album in my opinion. With albums like Vuelve and ALmas del Silencio, this just doesnt compare. After a few listens I was over it.

0307454541|4.0|A down-on-his-luck journalist is hired to write a family history and solve a 40 year-old mystery. Intrigue ensues, but fortunately he has a young cyber-goth assistant whose compu-skillz verge on deus ex machina...<br /><br />This is not a bad book, but neither is it 5-star material. It held my interest, though a good part of that was because I was expecting something more out of it and kept hoping for some sort of payoff. Without giving too much of a spoiler, the \\"mystery\\" aspect of this is painfully predictable, and the plot itself is rather paint-by-numbers and highly contrived.<br /><br />Believe it or not, I'm willing to forgive all that. Like I said, it held my interest, and part of my problem was my natural inclination to solve a mystery along with the protagonist. I suspect all the 5-star reviews are from people who don't read mysteries. I also suspect that if the author were American (and not dead) this book wouldn't have the following it does (ie: being deceased and from a relatively out-of-the-way place adds a mystique.) I myself am falling for this with giving it 4 stars.<br /><br />It's worth reading, but unless you're really lenient with what you consider 5-star stuff, ignore the hype & just enjoy the ride or you'll probably be let down.
B001IB63J2|4.0|I had to buy this album twice.  The first was warped by my three year old.  Anyway, this special edition vinyl version doesn't sound to good.  I think they just ripped the digital and not the master tapes.  The Black Parade sounded fantastic, Three Cheers not so much. It's a shame too because I like this album so much more.  The extra stuff that comes with it ain't too shabby either.  I give this a 4 star because the music is fantastic, but it loses a star for the sound quality.

Nothing bad to say about this at all, except I wish there was more of Idgie & Ruth. Awesome cast, good writing, well-made. Makes me laugh, cry & feel good every time I watch it. Special features definitely must see also & director's comments should put to rest all the questions about the relationship between the women. BTW, if you read the book, you'd know they are indeed a couple.

0307272702|5.0|This book is enlightening and eye opening.  As a health care professional I was forced during my schooling to regurgitate that which I was taught regarding nutrition in a multitude of papers and exams, the whole time knowing it to be untrue.  This book gives copious evidence to the truths I have learned through my own experience and through other books I have read on a low/no carbohydrate way of life.  My largest criticisms of the other books is that they were too \\"dumbed down\\" and didn't provide enough scientific explanation of the physiology behind how the diets worked.  This publication provides scientific information that is succinct, easy to understand, and logical.  It provides a well reasoned argument that is difficult for someone with an open mind to ignore.         On a personal note, I have battled with weight problems all my life and the only method of weight reduction that has worked for me is a very low carbohydrate lifestyle.  When restricting my carbohydrates to 20g or less a day I enjoy weight loss, an increase in energy, better sleep, a complete elimination of GERD symptoms, and an overall feeling of well being.         I suggest that people read this book and employ the knowledge they have gained into their daily lives.  If they give it a fair chance and stay the course through the initial carbohydrate withdrawals, which can be awful, they will be amazed at how wonderful they feel.  I sincerely hope that Mr. Taubes' efforts are noticed by the medical community at large and that there is a paradigm shift to that which scientific evidence supports over the current belief system based on unfounded suppositions.

1595141715|4.0|I see everyone is wild about this book, and I understand why, since I really enjoyed it.  No book is without its flaws, when it is judged as a novel (not as a PSA), so I will include those in this review.<br /><br />Clay is just a regular high-school wallflower - he has no beef with anybody and mostly stays wrapped up in his own life.  Until he gets a package on his doorstep with no return address, and included are cassette tapes, voice-recordings made by Hannah Baker - his recent crush, who more recently decided to end her own life and has used these tapes to pinpoint the 13 people who caused all her grief.  Guess what, Clay is one of them, and he has no idea what he did to deserve a part in this scandal of high-school scandals.  But of course he listens to Hannah's tapes anyway, as she describes piece by piece, the puzzle of her life, and the unexpected connections between 13 people who are not at all what they seem...<br /><br />This reminded me so much of Lauren Oliver's Before I Fall, as both books have in common a protagonist who is so unaware of their connections to other people as they go about their daily life.  I must admit I liked Oliver's take on this theme a little better, mostly because of some ... technical difficulties I had with Asher's.  The format is interesting, I enjoyed the back-and-forth between Hannah's voice on the tapes and Clay's intermittent reactions to what she says; however a lot of his reactions didn't seem very poignant or interesting, more like filler.  In the beginning this seemed to go very well, as Asher found a couple opportunities to insert some irony here and clever wit there, but later on the interjections from Clay just got to be distracting.  The story itself is a page-turner, and I couldn't help but like Hannah - although at the beginning you do think her just a woe-is-me attention-seeker for what she does, as the elements in her life all add up, I began to understand her.  The ending on the other hand was way too after-school special, so I had to say huh? I guess Asher was just trying to find a neat way to wrap it all up and that must've seemed heartwarming or something.  All in all, a great way to pass a couple days, which is all it took me to read it - the characters are engaging, their stories keep you guessing, and Clay is really cute.  Enjoy!I had to say huh?

B000M4RG42|5.0|I have never seen a movie like it, with such a complex interweaving of ideas, events, and characters.  It is a masterpiece that riveted me from beginning to end, brought me to tears as I remembered my own recently deceased father, and inspired me once again with the wonders of history, of evolving societies, and individual tragedy.  Eastwood is one of the greatest movie men who has ever lived.<br /><br />Prior to popping this into the DVD player, I was expecting it to be a simple war movie, in a way the mirror image of the wonderful Letters from Iwo Jima that portrayed the drama of the Japanese soldiers on the island with sympathy and intelligence.  Instead, after a brief action sequence that forced me to get the kids out of the TV room, I discovered that the film was more about 3 soldiers who were supposedly in the famous flag-raising photo.  They were taken to the US to serve as salesmen for war bonds, presented as heroes and fetted by the nation as celebrities.  Without taking any cheap shots, this adds a layer of irony that worked for me.<br /><br />Eastwood has several narratives gong at the same time, masterfully interwoven like a tapestry.  First, you have the stories of the boys themselves, clean marines who have little idea about where they are headed.  There are a sensitive Indian, braving many stereotypical slights about his race; an incompetent whom his superiors protect by making him a message runner behind the allied lines; and a straight-forward, courageous medic.  After an odd circumstance where a second flag is raised and enshrined by the iconic photo, these 3 boys are pulled from action and taken to accompany the Treasury Secretary on a massive fund raising trip for the War.  With the exception of the weak incompetent, they feel guilty about leaving their comrades and ashamed.  The Indian, Ira, is particularly torn and this brings out a terrible self-destructive streak.<br /><br />Second, the boys are held in the grip of traumatic memories from their experiences on Iwo Jima, images that will haunt them for the rest of their lives.  As they go through their duties, images and scenes pass through their minds with extraordinary vividness.  Interesting, while frighteningly realistic - you see many characters you got to know suddenly killed off - Eastwood refrains from showing the most gruesome images, such as a boy who was apparently tortured to death by mutilation (he was a \\"buddy\\" of the medic, who speaks of him on his death bed in a scene).  There are many moving scenes where the boys meet the parents of their fellows.<br /><br />Third, the son of the medic is leading an investigation into the real story, which his father never told him.  He meets many of his father's friends, who bring out new stories and perspectives.  His story comes up to the present, when he lays his father to rest.  This last scene was so well done that I re-lived the death of my own father and wept openly.<br /><br />The themes are so deep that I will watch this again and must read the book.  Eastwood questions the nature of heroism, portraying the heros as boys, each of them with their own sense of honor, fear, and courage.  Linked to this, Eastwood also portrays their use as political propaganda tools, however useful and needed they were to the war effort, which Eastwood never implies was unjust.  It is an interesting balance that is aware of hypocrisy yet not at all cynical.

As they go through their duties, images and scenes pass through their minds with extraordinary vividness.  Interesting, while frighteningly realistic - you see many characters you got to know suddenly killed off - Eastwood refrains from showing the most gruesome images, such as a boy who was apparently tortured to death by mutilation (he was a \\"buddy\\" of the medic, who speaks of him on his death bed in a scene).   There are many moving scenes where the boys meet the parents of their fellows.    Third, the son of the medic is leading an investigation into the real story, which his father never told him.  He meets many of his father's friends, who bring out new stories and perspectives.   His story comes up to the present, when he lays his father to rest.  This last scene was so well done that I re-lived the death of my own father and wept openly.      The themes are so deep that I will watch this again and must read the book.  Eastwood questions the nature of heroism, portraying the heros as boys, each of them with their own sense of honor, fear, and courage.  Linked to this, Eastwood also portrays their use as political propaganda tools, however useful and needed they were to the war effort, which Eastwood never implies was unjust.  It is an interesting balance that is aware of hypocrisy yet not at all cynical.

B000FC1AOI|2.0|...but it's pretty darn close. I continued since it was recommended by a friend. This book contained far-below-average writing about a very sensitive topic. First chapter, I thought I was on to something when I saw a passable standard portrayal of \\"grief\\" (not eating/sleeping, not attending to personal needs, etc.) I had hoped to see her pull herself up from that state and learn to live without her husband based on \\"inspirational letters\\" he had left her. Nope, not so much. When I reached 75% completion of this book, I knew no more about the relationship between Holly and Gerry than I did at 3%, and poor Gerry was receiving mention with even less frequency by that point. Holly's friends were virtually indistinguishable from Holly- all were just as immature, spoiled, and shallow as she was.<br /><br />The author, whose name was unfamiliar to me until I read another Amazon review, has clearly had no work experience, and could not have painted a more unrealistic picture of a couple's financial situation. To heck with life insurance!! To the devil with paying off a mortgage at news of a terminal illness!! Nope, the very last of this couple's money in the WORLD was spent on a vacation to Spain, sassy new outfits, haircolor jobs by an extreme cliche of a homosexual hairdresser, and pints at the pub! No matter if Holly can't afford to pay the library for internet service...Holly will simply cry, Mommy will just pick up her poor little baby at the library, shush her and give her 5000 euro. That will make things allllll better until Holly gets her ideal job after the first interview she undertakes. REALLY? No, REALLY?!?! Now, perhaps things in Ireland are QUITE different than in the USA, and if so, well...(thinking...) I've got nothin'.<br /><br />Holly and the entire crew surrounding her -friends and family alike- cuss like sailors and wave their middle fingers around all the time. Here, our author is sending a clear message, that being these characters are adults, and even though they behave like children they must be adults because they use those naughty words and the author said they were adults and they are old enough to go into a pub...therefore, they must be adults. Wow.<br /><br />The only reason for two stars is because a few weeks ago I actually read a worse book than this. It was tough to decide whether to give that second star, but I did because at least this author did not invent alter-identities for herself to falsely boost her Amazon ratings. At least I don't think she did...have like children they must be adults because they use those naughty words and the author said they were adults and they are old enough to go into a pub...therefore, they must be adults.

I have never had a favorite book, I read books like Harry Potter,the lightning thief, and The sisters grimm, then i read the Hunger Games and I had found my favorite book.....Suzanne Cllins writes like no other author, you will never know what will happen next in the book. The Hunger Games is a book for anyone looking for a book with high action, suspense, lovable characters and a hint of romance. You will be hooked on this book from the first page to the last page of the last book. I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!!!

Haven't listened through the whole album, I'm waiting for the replacement stylus. However I have read on forums that this has also been a problem on their copies of the LP. If I knew I would have passed on this vinyl. However I love the mood and lyrics of this album. The album came in custom amazon packaging which protected it great, no warps.
B003EI2EH2|3.0|That's not exactly earth shattering, or new.  It's a lot like any low carb diet, except the \\"no dairy\\" rule keeps people from inventing incredibly unhealthy fat-filled meals that do still meet the low-carb standard.  I think it's a pretty smart plan, all the eating except on the cheat day is pretty healthy.  But, like Atkins or most other low-carb diet, much of the initial result is a loss of water weight.      I enjoyed the book, there were lots of useful bits of information and plenty of things to try.

B001IBIHQ4|5.0|Seems difficult to grasp before watching it, but The Pacific has all the action of the original Band of Brothers but, for me, reaches a deeper level of feeling and gruelling intensity throughout the course of the series. Two reasons for this are apparent (for me at least) - by focusing on the plight of just three main characters you form a closer relationship with the soldiers and their journey through the war as opposed to the larger ensemble cast of the \\"original\\" (that's not to say there isn't a focus on the soldiers' relationships with their comrades-in-arms), the other reason being the varied and almost 'light' chapters dotted throughout the series that, to begin with, are seemingly at odds with the constant warfare of BOB (nice acronym). The Pacific takes you to locales beyond the deadly islands where the war pans out, and this breathing room for the characters makes the claustrophobia of war that follows all the more shattering and inevitable.     If you liked Band of Brothers, you'll find this a worthy follow-up. If you didn't (or haven't given it a try yet), don't rule The Pacific out - an emotional and literal theatre of war.
0545265355|5.0|I was so thankful that I thought to buy the whole set in advance. I read the entire set in a week after buying the set for my 11 year old son for Christmas - LOL.  I heard a lot of buzz about the books so I decided to give the first one a try, after one day and before I knew it, I had to borrow the second one from my son (he was already on #2) so I could keep going.  I read the second one the following day and the third by a couple of days later.  I highly recommend the books, at any age, boy or girl.  My son is enjoying them as much as I did and the story is so descriptive that you are in their world while you are reading.  These became the \\"don't bug me, I'm reading\\" set of books for about a week.  Enjoy!

0470601787|4.0|In \\"Visual Meetings: How Graphics, Sticky Notes and Idea Mapping Can Transform Group Productivity,\\" (Wiley) author and business consultant David Sibbet, explains, in quite lucid terms, the advantages of utilizing the new language of visual thinking particularly in the group setting for the creation and communication of ideas, plans and programs designed for ease of use and maximum comprehension.<br /><br />Sibbet begins by explaining the advantages of visual thinking, the tools involved, the language of the communicator as well as the rules of the road for navigating group meetings around the creative process. In Sibbet's view, (much like Dan Roam's earlier work) visual thinking has it's own language, where symbols, boxes, arrows and lines serve distinct purposes in communicating organizational ideas. From brainstorming to idea mapping to storytelling, the book describes every aspect of visual (i.e. graphic) communication, including formating your output using templates, up-to-the-minute software resources and even tablets like the iPad.<br /><br />Sibbet's book is similar to Roam's previous work, wit perhaps a greater emphasis on the group aspect of visual thinking, but either book unlocks the code of presenting ideas in graphics instead of text. After spending time with any of these books, you will be convinced that you need a white board for nearly every conversation. Bring plenty of Sharpies.

0470876417|4.0|\\"Business Model Generation\\" (Wiley) a new book by Alexander Osterwalder and Yves Pigneur. More than a book, \\"BMG\\" is a project, nine years in the making and involving the contributions of some 470 members who set out to discover and expand upon a new formula for generating new businesses and retooling existing ones around a model of what works in todays seemingly topsy-turvy, customer centric business world.<br /><br />Examples from the Apple iTunes store to Amazon to the new model of book publishing are all explored and exposed as they take old style businesses and transform them into future facing models based around multiple distribution models, product sourcing and revenue streams. At the core of the BMG model is the grid (they call it the `canvas') that contains the nine building blocks common to all new businesses. Key activities, partners and resources, mesh with cistomer relationships, segments, value propositions, distribution channels and costs/revenues to form a holistic model that works for just about any business. In doing so, new opportunities present themselves while tired ones get exposed for what they are. Both group and visual thinking serve to unlock the value of a business whether it's a new concept on the drawing board or an industry in need of retooling. In short, a new way of looking at business plans that fits perfectly with the post-web new world order of business today.
030746363X|3.0|I read this book without any expectations. Generally speaking I am not a fan of anything that sounds like a get rich quick scheme. This book has some good information like, increasing foods low in processed carbs and sugar and drinking more water make perfect sense. Some of its claims related to ice bathing and sexual enhancements, supplements and sleep really dont speak to me. I think for some people a few of his suggestions could actually cause health problems. But here is the most positive spin I can put on a book like this and a take away message that I think is key: He found out what worked for him.   We are all individual biologic beings. One size does not fit all related to our nutrition, exercise, sex, emotional well being, sleep needs, or our spirituality (which is not addressed). As other reviews have reiterated, he did most of his \\"experiments\\" on himself. And as the author states, these techniques worked for some people. So if this book helps you great, if it doesn't find something that does. There are many voices and many messages. I think the mistake we make is presuming we are a failure if something doesn't work for us. Also not everyones communication style speaks to everyone. There are core principles to all books like this that include improved nutritional intake and movement...but there are many more issues at play so dont give up in pursuit of the \\"Forever Body\\" that brings you optimal health and wellness.

0312600844|3.0|Jonathan Franzen is a wonderful writer. Even as I struggled to like or understand the characters in \\"Freedom,\\" his ability to move a story forward kept me reading. I would stumble over some astonishing turn of phrase or observation that knocked my socks off. He has a great gift with voice -- the sections that are meant to have been written by Patty are brilliant. And I loved his antagonistic characters: the woman who makes a play for Walter (Walter? really?), Patty's sister the wackadoo Manhattan performance artist, the rock-ribbed fundamentalist cat lover near the end of the book. Some of Franzen's best characters are people who only show up for a few pages, leaving you saying, \\"Wow, what was THAT?\\" Wonderfully done.    But, as an earlier reviewer said, I found the major characters hard to believe, with the exception of Richard, the horndog rock-n-roller who turns out to have a soul of some description, in between anonymous sexual encounters and bouts of self-indulgent, let-me-be-creative moodiness. He turned out to be a sympathetic character, believe it or not, while the Berglunds just left me cold. I empathized with Patty, but wanted to kick her down the stairs. Walter does not make sense to me at all.    Still, you will want to keep reading, just to find out what happens to this glorious mess, and obviously a lot of other readers admire the book a lot, so don't let me keep you from reading this. I recommend \\"Freedom\\" with reservations.

B004132HZS|5.0|Like many people, I considered Jeremy Brett's depictions of Sherlock Holmes in the 1980s and 1990s to have been the non plus ultra of dramatizations of Conan Doyle's famous detective.  Thus I was somewhat skeptical when I read of plans to film new Sherlock adventures set in the 21st century. \\"Blasphemy!\\" was my first reaction: Holmes belongs in gaslit fog shrouded Victorian London.<br /><br />Fortunately, I was willing to give the new series a try, and from the first few moments I was riveted.  Benedict Cumberbatch is an ideal Holmes, transferring all the detective's celebrated mannerisms and quirks and giving them a new, modern polish.  Likewise Martin Freeman brings Watson to life marvellously, and the supporting cast is perfection.  The scenes move as rapidly as Holmes' own mind, so that you are literally on the edge of your seat hardly daring to blink lest you miss an important clue.<br /><br />The three adventures in this set come with a promise of perhaps more to come, and I certainly hope that is true, because I will never again see Holmes as a period piece, but as the thoroughly modern sleuth he deserves to be.
B0041VV03A|2.0|Good concept, but terrible delivery.    The sex scenes are incredibly awkward, and the latter scenes are borderline bestiality.    I recommend you watch this alone because it WILL get awkward if you watch it with your friends or your SO.
1416955070|2.0|I wanted to like it - I really did!  I am one of those terribles that remembered her love for reading fiction with series like Harry Potter and Twilight, and is having a hard time coming to grips with the reality that not every young adult series is as compelling as those two.  I did not find the the characters actions believable, or the teen-angst genuine.  I am a teacher, so I see a lot of teen-angst in my line of work.  The premise was good.  I thought that runes were an original and well-developed facet in this author's world.  A few characters were compelling, but I could not seem to shake the feeling that this book was trying too hard.  It's like the author was throwing a bunch of ideas that have worked in other books together, and the \\"teens\\" are far too adult in thier thoughts and actions.  It just did not strike me as authentic that all the characters, even the bookworms, just loved to go to night clubs and sexy parties.  The love triangle is not believable, but to be fair, to me the whole love-triangle angle is getting a little tired in young adult literature.<br /><br />Disclaimer:  A lot of my teenage students love it, and I am aware that real adults are not the target audience.

1594202842|1.0|To answer the question in vilnius researcher \\"Ginny\\"'s review title, \\"Is this the norm for a Chinese-American mom?!\\"     My answer is clear - Absolutely NOT!     I am a Chinese mother who came to the States for an advanced degree 30 years ago. I also have two daughters. As a Chinese American, I am grateful for the opportunity to know both cultures and I have tried to make the best of the two worlds and strive for a balance - discipline and perseverance from Chinese culture; creativity and respect to individuals from Western.     The keywords in Ms Amy Chua's book title, \\"Battle\\", \\"Tiger\\", \\"Superior\\", reflects her own personal traits. Those are not the words or values that I want to instill onto my children. I have raised my daughters to do their best, to understand the importance of collaboration, and to have empathy toward those who are in disadvantaged positions. Both of my daughters are well-balanced, self-motivated, independent, happy, and active in community.     I agree with Ginny that Ms Chua needs psychological help. There is a valid concern about her daughters' emotional well-being. I have witnessed several of my very outstanding friends with successful careers, who are still deeply struggling with the negative impacts from their childhood. I would not have known it if they did not confide to me. Among them, Chinese or Americans, there is one thing in common - a narcissistic mother who believes that she owns her child. Our children come through us, but not from us. Each child is a life his or her own and one that each parent should respect and cherish.     Ms Amy Chua is an extreme case and is NOT a norm for a Chinese-American mom. She is the one that needs help.
B003Y5H4SO|2.0|The positive reviews here are scarier than the movie.  This felt like a made-for-TV/cable/video movie.  Everything about it felt so ordinary, especially the poor script.

Cheap and bad B movie with a high budget.  What a waste of a Saturday night.  I lost a fraction of an IQ point, I think.  Hollywood--quit insulting us!

B000068FY0|5.0|For starters, i was born in '87, many years after Roger Hodgson left Supertramp. I bought Breakfast in America about a year ago (for The Logical Song), and started listening to the whole album a few months later. I fell in love with it, especially songs like Child of Vision.    I bought this about 45 days ago, but am only now getting around to writing a review, and I have to say I think it's better than Breakfast. For one thing I enjoy every song on the album (Casual Conversations did nothing for me), and for another, the songs transition so perfectly into one another. Some specific thoughts on each of the songs:    School: Always makes me think of America's education system, especially when you get teachers more focused on getting the material out there than being engaging, which, IMO causes a lot of the disconnect.    Bloody Well Right: Honestly, i think of it as being a simple reminder that if you want to change things, whining about it isn't going to do it.    Hide in your Shell: A  reminder that there are always those willing to help you?    Asylum: Reminds me of several studies that showed that you can be declared insane and not decalred sane until they decide you're fixed, even if you were never insane to begin with    Dreamer: A reminder to act on your dreams.    Rudy: All about one very messed up individual.    If everyone was listening: I'm not sure what it's going for, but it's a really good song.    Crime of the centruy: Media sensationalism?

B004HO6HWA|3.0|Lacking originality and surprise, The Mechanic is nonetheless enjoyable for the action sequences alone.  Awards it will not win, and there is quite a bit for a viewer to dislike, but the fast pace keeps the parts shiny despite the lack of polish.<br /><br />Arthur Bishop (Jason Statham) is a hitman who does everything perfectly, lives in a secluded multimillion dollar house, and gets his jobs via a hitman's version of Craigslist.  Not quite as hyper or entertaining as his roles in the Crank movies, Statham nonetheless toes the brooding, meticulous line of someone in that line of work.  It's believable, I suppose.  His mentor and confidant Harry Foster (Donald Sutherland) worries less about the next target than he does his own son Steve (Ben Foster), an aimless troublemaker itching to find his niche.  As the assassination business goes, complications lead to Harry fostering a relationship with Steve, who wants to emulate the Spy vs. Spy routines of which his father spoke so highly.  Probably a bad idea since Steve is a drunk.<br /><br />While I probably liked this movie more than most, there were numerous problems that will relegate this film to a future in the Walmart $5 bin.  First and foremost, the tension in the action is great, and there are several white-knuckle scenes, but if I had a nickel for every millisecond cut I would have been able to watch several better movies the night I watched this.  That is my new pet peeve.  The cuts during several spots were so fast they were nearly subliminal.  It's a shame, too, because the gunplay and stunt-work in the movie are superb.  The headshots fly through with force and gusto; someone really wanted to ensure there was no doubt with a quite a few deaths.<br /><br />Regarding the story and the plot, that's clearly not the point of this movie.  Well, maybe it is, but originality surely isn't.  I don't mind brainless movies - happens to be one of my favorite genres - but please make at least one aspect of the movie unpredictable.  This may as well have been a silent film with a caption that read, \\"Hitman goes through training,\\" before showing Statham and Foster in their machine gun montage.  Speaking of that, you'd think there would be more to being an elite hitman than a few random medical books and assorted time in the backyard range.<br /><br />The moment that ruined the movie for me, however, was Ben Foster's ridiculous reenactment of Kevin Bacon's infamous \\"so mad I have to dance\\" scene from [[ASIN:B00005JKYI Footloose]].

B003UESJEM|3.0|\\"The Company Men\\" tells the story of people caught in the economic downturn that began in September of 2008. It's a timely and well-crafted film, although I suspect the intention was less about thoughtful examination and more about appealing to the masses. Many films are intentionally designed to garner sympathy, but few are this forthcoming about it; scenes and characters are so perfectly in tune with real events that we're basically required to see things from their point of view, and if we don't, we might as well move to another planet. I have no doubt that many people will leave the theater feeling as if the film spoke directly to them, that it understood their plight, that it said the things few have been willing to say. It's a satisfying experience, but keep in mind that satisfaction can be the result of manipulation.    The working characters in this film have built their lives around a Boston-based shipbuilding corporation called GTX. As a result of the bad economy, the company has been downsizing. One of its casualties is Bobby Walker (Ben Affleck), who had grown accustomed to the Porsche, the golf games, and the expensive suburban house his six-figure income allowed him. His severance package includes temporary placement at a job search center, where he will learn how to improve his resume, listen to motivational speeches, and sit in a cubical all day making calls to companies he feels qualified to work for. Despite these efforts, he's unwilling to scale back on his lifestyle, for he wants to maintain his image. His wife, Maggie (Rosemarie DeWitt), lovingly but firmly reminds him that an image is far less important than providing for his family.    Bobby is consistently sneered at by his brother-in-law, Jack (Kevin Costner), who owns a small construction company and swears by honest manual labor. He and his crew are building a house, and despite his misgivings, he offers Bobby a job. This means, of course, that Bobby will have to swallow his pride and actually join the working class, which he has always felt was beneath him. With this in mind, it seems clear to me that Jack, while a decent and competent character, is little more than a tool at the mercy of the plot, a way to make Bobby understand and appreciate the value of hard work. I had a much better response to Bobby's teenage son, Drew (Anthony O'Leary); Bobby's intention is to set a good example for his son, but it's ultimately Drew who sets a good example for his father.    Another casualty is Phil Woodward (Chris Cooper), who quickly learns that few companies are interested in an unemployed executive pushing sixty. It's strongly suggested that he dye his hair. He's warned against including jobs prior to the 1990s on his resume, for those are considered ancient history. He's told to avoid making specific references to Vietnam when listing his military experience. As the months go by, he begins to realize how much his life was defined by his work, which essentially boiled down to making money for GTX. He believed he was valued; he didn't know his worth was in direct proportion to the status of his company. He learns the hard way that, once you've been fired from an executive position, it's a little too late to discover you're no good at anything else.    Yet another casualty is Gene McClary (Tommy Lee Jones), who started GTX with James Salinger (Craig T. Nelson). They're both of a time and place in which corporations served a purpose and its employees were honest and treated with respect. Gene maintains a belief in those ideals. The same cannot be said of James - he believes that companies exist primarily to capitalize on profits, and if that requires many of its employees to lose their jobs, then so be it. Gene is so embroiled in this aspect of the story that I can't help but wonder why it was deemed necessary to include a subplot with his wife (Patricia Kalember), who he leaves for his mistress, Sally Wilcox (Maria Bello), who just happens to be the same woman responsible for firing Bobby.    I responded to these characters, and I certainly responded to the story. Still, \\"The Company Men\\" never quite becomes the illuminating masterpiece it was so clearly intended to be. It deftly addresses current economic issues, but the plot feels manufactured for mass consumption. Perhaps I was hoping for another version of \\"Up in the Air,\\" which was both considerate and heartbreaking in its examination of a man whose life is his job, which is nothing more nor less than relieving other people of their jobs. That movie humanized the economic downturn far more effectively, and it also managed to tell a thoroughly absorbing story. \\"The Company Men\\" is decent overall, but it's more like wish fulfillment, a story designed with the sole purpose of winning over an audience.
B000683VI4|4.0|If you like \\"chick flicks\\" you will undoubtedly enjoy \\"The Notebook\\".  It has all the ingredients for success.  Good looking actors/actresses, nice setting and scenery, as well as great story line.  There is plenty of romance and more than enough \\"hanky\\" scenes.  My daughters and wife loved it, and I had no trouble (the only man in the room) staying interested.  If you like this type of movie, this is definitely one of the better ones.
B0032JTV6U|5.0|Thanks Amazon.  Super great price for new sealed DVD. Received item really quickly.   Just started tuning into this show this season and missed all of last season.  This caught me up. I think this show tackles today's issues in a smart, funny, campy way that really speaks (and sings) to all age ranges.  Love it!
B000FC130E|5.0|My only wish is that there were more. Dont get me wrong its a very good length I just want another book. I didnt want it to end! : D
0802130208|5.0|Absurdly brilliant. The proclamations that come out of the main character, Ignatius J. Reilly's mouth are beyond hilarious i.e. \\"Canned food is a perversion.\\" If you like books such as Catch-22, you will love A Confederacy of Dunces. If you couldn't see the humor in Catch-22 however then back away from this book right now because you will despise its irreverence.
B0030E1XJU|5.0|We got the entire set for our sons 6th birthday. He loves it and so does his daddy. They have had tons of fun setting it up in different ways. Our son also uses it to act out part of the movie and to just play in his own imaginative way. On the down sides storage is a bit of an issue, and they don't give you all the characters with the sets that they display on the front. You can buy them separate but I think that was very stinky of the company to do to kids and their parents. The original price is plenty high enough to have included all the characters shown with each stunt. But even with all that said this is an awesome toy! Our son is very good at putting it all together and taking it back apart. His daddy just showed him how at the beginning and now he can do it. This toy would not be for most kids younger then 5. This set is one of his favorite sequences of the entire set. We would definitely recommend this toy.
B0044430H8|3.0|Those of you familiar with Brian Eno's work 'Ambient 1: Music for Airports'(1978) will unmistakenly note the extreme similarity between the simple introspective piano theme on this soundtrack and Eno's themes on 'Airports'. Although the melody line is not exactly the same, the tone, depth, and mood are nearly identical.    Another poster mentioned other composers by whom this soundtrack seems to be influenced and given the subject matter of the movie itself (alleged stolen intellectual property) I thought I'd offer some credit to Brian Eno.
1416583432|1.0|Horowitz starts off with some entertaining and seemingly insightful content that rapidly devolves into the typical anthropomorphic depiction of dogs as people with fur.  She denies this but the treatment of the subject soon generates such comparisons.  She claims to apply her scientific background to the issue but then you discover that her educational background is in philosophy and \\"cognitive science\\".  She clearly implies that all that biologists and professional dog trainers would tell you about dogs is way off base and is fraught with error.  Her personal dog experiences, anecdotal really, are framed as the more accurate and dependable and are the basis for many of her conclusions.    The book is entertaining if you ignore the claims that here are special insights into dog behavior.  She obvioulsy loves dogs and and is a skilled writer but if you are looking for canine behavioral science , look elsewhere.    For the record, I am not a biologist or a dog trainer.
B004G6009U|5.0|First of all, I'd like to say that I'm 24 and have parents in their 50's.  That being said, we decided to go see Tangled one day while I was home around Thanksgiving, especially since it was in our local $3 theater.  We had a BLAST!!!  The movie really did have something for everyone.  I was very impressed with Disney about how they personified Max.  I think he really helped to make the film what it is.    Overall, I felt like a kid while I watched this movie.  It had everything:  comedy, action, romance...  I felt that it was a great spin on Rapunzel, and that it was definitely \\"a keeper\\" when it comes to my movie collection.
B001HN69AY|4.0|I resisted seeing this movie because I tend to find most \\"arty\\" films slow, depressing, and full of people that I couldn't care less about if I tried. As for Gilliam, while I loved Time Bandits and The Fisher King and I really liked 12 Monkeys, I couldn't stand The Brothers Grimm and there are several others that I never had the slightest urge to see. I can honestly say that I didn't want to see this movie and only watched it because my husband wanted to see it.  My only expectation going in was that I was going to hate it and/or be completely bored.  Much to my surprise, none of my expectations were met.  I really really enjoyed this movie!    Yes, the story meanders a bit -- Valentina (Lily Cole) even complains, angrily, to her father, Dr Parnassus (Plummer), \\"You never finish your stories!\\" I'm sure that it's a criticism that Gilliam has probably heard, himself. Yes, it is a bit disjointed and some questions are never answered. Yes, Farrell is definitely the weakest of the three actors that stepped into Ledger's role. And, finally, the ending was anti-climatic and a bit \\"meh\\" (and raised more unanswered questions, but not any that have to be answered to get the movie). So, why did I give it 4 stars? Because the more I think about the movie, the more I like it.     Unlike some of the reviewers, I didn't find it confusing or hard to follow. I was interested in what was going to happen to these people. I found some of the points that Gilliam raised very intriguing -- ie, the role of the storyteller in today's society; the nature of \\"choice\\" and good vs. evil and what actually constitutes \\"evil\\". I liked that -- in the interest of not spoiling it in any way, I'll just say that I like that a couple of the characters really surprised me in the end because they either were not, or were not wholly, who I thought they were. And visually? Well, as everyone else has pointed out, visually it was a treat.     I don't think that this movie is for everyone, obviously.  I've read quite a few reviews of it and people tend to either really love it or hate it with a burning passion.  I haven't really figured out what those of us who love it have in common, though, or what unites those that hate it, other than their antipathy.  Consequently, it's difficult to say, \\"Yes, you will love this movie!  Run out and see it now!\\"  However, if you like fables, fairy tales, and fantastically, dream-like imagery, if you can deal with a plot that isn't entirely straightforward, if you can live with not having all of the questions answered at the end -- you might really like this movie a lot, too.  If nothing else, like me, you could be pleasantly surprised by how much you enjoyed it, too.
1401219268|5.0|I can honestly say I saw the amazing movie before reading the even greater original book. Much to my amazement, Zack Snyder was pretty faithful to the source material. And as for the book itself, it really is a must read. The book brilliantly touches on the most sensitive issues of the time , including the above all the Cold War. But it also hints at and  studies the sad and undeniable history of human violence, and subtly makes the fact known that humans are savage by  nature. That perhaps, it is within our nature and natural forecast to destroy our selves. To sum up all the emotions and ideologies of this book seems to be impossible, but one character himself said it perfectly in what remains to be my favorite quote of a fictionalized character ever to be written down:<br /><br />\\"Existence is random. Has no pattern save what we imagine after staring at it for too long. No meaning save what we choose to impose.\\"- Rorschach, Watchmen.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|the suspence of this magial book kept me on my feet the while i was reading it.  it was amazing but the part with the dogs that looked like tributes was disturbing
1423113497|4.0|No - this is no Harry Potter.  But, this is definitely a good series -- especially for little boys.  Riordian does a really good job of keeping the action going.  And the titles of the chapters are enough to get my boys laughing hard.  I think they can relate to Percy Jackson very much (even if they aren't dyslexic or have ADHD).  My kids looove history, so the Greek Mythology was quite interesting for them.  Definitely worth the read.
144937980X|4.0|This book is nice introduction to Processing. Nothing more, nothig less. Book will explain all of basic concepts in very understandable way. Dont expect advanced topics.

0439023513|3.0|I have to say I was really disappointed in Katniss.  So much for realizing what Gale was ranting about when they'd hunt in the woods.  So much for understanding what Peeta said on the rooftop about \\"dying as himself\\". She let herself by played by District 13 just as much as she was played by the Capitol.  I'm glad I finished the series, but I really did think that it would end differently.  Rather than becoming the Mockingjay, she let herself be pushed and pulled by circumstance and other individuals' agendas.  Katniss never became the individual she strived to be in that first book, and I have to admit, it was dissapointing.<br /><br />That being said -- I'm glad I finished the series.  What's a hero, if not flawed and not necessarily doing what I think they should?!  Welcome to real life, right?<br /><br />I like the message of the series, but I think the mark was missed in the end.
B0042EJD8A|5.0|A good documentary, for me, is one I watch more than once in order to absorb the content.  Lots of content here.  Not the entire story of fracking, but enough to get any high-school or college class well started on doing the research.  Missing is the crucial fact that there probably isn't nearly as great a supply of natural gas through this technology as the industry is claiming.    If videos like this one help to convince Americans that the escalating environmental (and financial) costs of meeting our current energy demands are not worth it, then this was a success on all fronts.
0439023491|4.0|I have to say, that I didn't think anything more twisted than the Hunger Games could exist, but the Quarter Quell really took my breath away.  More lies from the Capitol - you win the Hunger Games and you're safe for the rest of your life, right?  Oh, and there's this bridge I have to sell...<br /><br />That was a really nice twist to the Capitol's perverse goal of keeping the districts in line.  Obviously, a very bad decision on the Capitol's part - seeing as how that stoked the fires of rebellion probably more than Katniss did, but hey - there's gonna be a war, of that, there's no doubt.<br /><br />The Victory Tour was a bit tough to read through (although, I did like when they visited District 11). And I have to say, the love triangle made me just shake my head with disappointment. I saw it coming in book one, when Gale said \\"just remember...\\" and got cut off.  It was kind of obvious, but I did have my hopes that we wouldn't go down that road, but oh, well.<br /><br />All in all, a nice set-up for book #3...

B003EYVXUU|5.0|I very seldom write a review about a movie. I really love movies and watching them. I have quite a collection, but very few movies inspire me enough to write a review. Now, don't get me wrong, there are a lot of very good and inspiring movies out there. In the end though, it's all about personal preference. That said, LET ME IN is truly a movie that will tug on your heart. How can you not feel for Abby and all she has to go though and deal with, even though she's a vampire!!!! I haven't watched many movies that are able to take me though the full range of my emotions. A movie that can make you sad, cry, laugh, cheer, love, (sometimes jump and shout), but most of all make you think, is truly an AWESOME movie!!!!! That's the main reason I rarely write a review for a movie I've seen, because few movies can do all of that for me. I do however, recommend lots of movies I've seen to other people in person. I don't think many peole will not like LET ME IN. It is truly a Beautiful movie in every aspect, as far as movies are concerned. I watch ninty-five percent of my movies in blu-ray. And, this blu-ray is superb in picture quality and sound. I try to get people who really enjoy movies to invest in a decent set-up. I know times are hard but I still recommend this anyway. I've helped a few people get a good five point one system, and they are TOTALLY surprised at/by the end results. As I like to say, \\"It's not enough to simply watch a movie, you need to experience it!\\"
B0041KKYEW|5.0|Absolutely dark, twisted and incredibly sensual. Natalie Portman puts on a riveting performance of a tormented ballerina obsessed with perfection as the Swan Queen. With the added hallucination and a determination not to be outdone or replaced, she gives her unexpected best to dire consequences. Mila Kunis gives great supporting performance as the alternate, Black Swan with her lusty and sensual outlook. Barbara Hershey is great as the controlling mum who is disgruntled with the way her own life has turned out. Vincent Cassel, like Mila Kunis, is instrumental in bringing out the best in Portman's performance. Even Wiona Ryder, as the has-been diva, gives a splendid performance within the 6-minute screen time.<br />Darren Aronosfky has once again skilfully married the powerful script with artful direction.

B000SXOK4G|5.0|I saw Ben harper perform most of the songs off this albumb at Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival and I was so impressed I bought all of his albumbs when I returned home. His improvisational style, mellow tone, and sophistocated lyrics make for a mind blowing hour or so in this albumb alone. I reccomend that if you like this albumb you also download his albumb with the innocent criminals, that albumb rivals this one to be honest, and I know you wont be dissappointed, or wonder where your money went when you listen to this albumb in it's entirety! Keep listining, and follow the music, it will set you free!
B001N44BVQ|2.0|DiCaprio is a spy. The greatest dangers he faces are not the terrorists but his boss, a gung-ho glory jockey played by Russell Crowe, and Crowe's rival for the command post, a stereotypical brain-dead but obstinately arrogant bureaucrat that the civil services breed like rats. No matter what happens, it is only a matter of time before DiCaprio gets screwed.        DiCaprio wants to establish trust with the anti-terror unit he works with, so he can eventually nail the top terrorists.  But Crowe is too impatient, and will take any risk, abuse any relationship and burn any asset for a quick result that he can show off to the big boss to boost his career, even if it means getting his own agents killed.   It is a very revealing look at how a US agency works, very realistic and a great eye-opener. But the plot gets muddled and the ending is a bit anti-climatic.

B003VANOFY|4.0|In my search for a wireless headset for my Xbox 360, I performed a seach on Amazon for \\"Xbox 360 wireless headsets\\" and this one came up. I ordered it and when I got it I found out it wasn't for Xbox 360. If I had read the details further, I would have found it was for Windows XP, 7, or Vista. Still it shouldn't have been included in my search. Never the less, lesson learned and I did need a good headset for my computers too.<br /><br />It is a nice headset, but a bit more complicated than some. It has six buttons and a volume control. The sound reproduction has been excellent. Battery life has been pretty good, it hasn't run out on me yet. Of course I have only watched a movie on my laptop with it. Over all it is comfortable, but a bit on the heavy side. They are big enough that Logitech could have designed it to take a couple of AA batteries, instead of the lithium battery, and still have room.<br /><br />The USB receiver is a little on the long side. It is just begging for someone to just give it a whack or snag it on something. I usually use my laptop when I am lying down so the potential is there for either to occur.<br /><br />I tried to install it on my desktop and received a message about my processor not being adequate. Ouch! So it is limited to my laptop. My desktop is 1.8 ghz Athlon and my laptop is a 1.9 ghz. So close. It looks like I will still be in search of a wireless headset for both Xbox 360 and my desktop.
0061726826|4.0|I hate having to admit that I kinda had a hard time connecting to DELIRIUM at first, I found myself getting distracted by other things and putting the book down a lot. However in saying that Delirium is very beautifully written and grew on me as the story went on.  The main character Lena starts off like everyone else, following rules, wanting to be \\"cured\\" of the disease of Amor Deliria Nervosa (aka Love) only to fall and love. The connection between Lena and Alex comes off heartfelt and strong. The characters grow on you and you find yourself wanting to know more about them. The ending ends on a bit of a cliffhanger but not so big of one that your left wanting a true ending. Delirium is the first novel in a trilogy and I cant wait to see what happens next in PANDEMONIUM.
B0019N8P2W|3.0|Daria is still one of the most excellent TV show and it's a pleasure to see her again, and be able to read an episode whenever you want.    But the DVD is really minimalistic: No subtitle, which is quite problematic for a stranger like me (I'm french). I'm able to understand most of the show but the English subtitle really help when it's got to quick. I do have a dvd ZONE 1 player so the dvd zone is not a problem. But no subtitle is really problematic. I tried to use SRT subtitle with my dvd player but it won't work.  I read that the closed captioned is still on the DVD but I didn't find any player which are able to read the CC.    So the DVD features is quite cheap, and others publishers are able to do a really good jobs on DVD (I bought Samurai Jack too, there is English subtitle AND french subtitle, this is luxury!), but Daria is still gorgeously good!    PS: sorry for the bad english, I tried to be clear anyway
B004BLJQOK|4.0|Why oh why would they remake this movie again? I was expecting it to be better than the first (Let the right one in) which I must say was a great film, even with the voice dubbing.<br />I do admit that the special effects were a bit better although limited as they were, I would have loved to have seen much more. Example; Dropping or flying from a ten story window. Why would they cut such a cool scene?  Also; we had a chance to see a flash back to Abby's beginnings, but it was deleted and very short. This film could have been so much better and with a little effort would have left us setting in our sets saying WOW.<br />If you haven't seen the original (Let the right one in) then I suggest that you get this film and enjoy. But I would also suggest that you find and rent the original and compare. Much like watching the original (Hills have eyes) compared to the newer version, it's basically the same film with a few added effects and some dropped scenes.

0393338827|5.0|I worked at Salomon Brothers and predecessor companies for 22 years and like many others I found myself unemployed by 2009. Like many others I scratch my head. How could a small group of idiots inside each of about 8 or 9 big companies (Citi, GS, ML, MS, UBS, AIG, Lehman, Bear, BoA) have nearly destroyed the global financial system? Greed? Absolutely. Inertia, irreversible momentum, arrogance, lack of experience - yes again. Even now the main players are said to have no ability to see that they played a direct role. They take no responsibility.<br /><br />Here in Lewis' book you get a great first slice of the very bloody collision of personal gain and public interest where professionalism and ethics were tossed aside. Lewis' gift for explaining the seemingly complex is on full display. He has such curiosity for his subject and its players which he puts into words better than almost any non-fiction writer publishing today.  Seemingly arcane details turn into page turning chapters.<br /><br />He asks and answers the right questions. Why would Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Merrill, Morgan Stanley and others get involved in subprime loans? How and why did S&P and Moody's rate these bonds, even the lowest ranked as investment grade? Why did they get in bed with the lenders directly creating the \\"consumer finance\\" business? What were their lending practices? And who were the borrowers?<br /><br />All captured here. Somehow he found 3 or 4 of the few investors that could see this coming and prepared well for that day. They are interesting characters with nothing in common with each other and each with is own reasons for stumbling onto realizing how this was all a ponzi scheme and going to fail. All only gradually realizing that they had stumbled onto something that was far bigger and worse further they explored.<br /><br />Sadly, we sit here 2 years later and NOTHING has changed. AIG will soon be the last of the big culprits to go on it's merry way. S&P and Moody's have faced ZERO legal challenges and continue to dominate the ratings game. The SEC head is an classic insider - Mary Shapiro. Ex-Citi CEO Chuck Prince was gracefully placed on the Xerox board in 2008 by it's then CEO and Citi boardmember Anne Mulcahey. Morgan Stanley CEO John Mack retired without incident in 2010. There are no new substantial rules on lending practices. Structured products (the CLO's, CDO's...) are returning. Stanley O'nell departed Merrill with a $200mm retirement package!!<br /><br />Collectively the books written about the era are our only means to shame these individuals and companies that brought down our economy and the US's position in the world.

B0029LHW68|5.0|Firstly, let me say that I wasn't a fan of 30 Seconds to Mars until I heard this CD.  Ordinarily, I like Progressive Metal (typically European), and only rarely do I make forays into other genres.  I've always found 30 Seconds to Mars to be a bit mundane and overly reliant on \\"screamo-style\\" vocals, and their song writing has never especially appealed to me.     However, I always saw a certain spark of potential in the band and whenever This is War came out I downloaded it without any high expectations; what a monumental and rewarding surprise it was when I found out how much the band had refined its sound and matured its songwriting.   I'm sure that in part it has something to do with their new, high-profile producer, but practically every band has a producer to help them out so I don't really think it takes credit away from them.      I think the biggest change is that Jared's singing has not only improved in skill but also in method.  His voice is dynamic and emotional, and he has ceased to rely on throaty screams to fill in spaces between the music.  Anytime there is a screamo element of that sort it is surgically placed and serves the song instead of being there for no apparent reason.     The songs on the album are of an extremely high and consistent quality.  Every song is enjoyable and integral to the album--there are no \\"fillers\\" that beg to be skipped.  The songs have a vast, epic quality to them that makes them unusually powerful compared to a lot of other \\"modern\\" rock bands.  Coheed and Cambria is the only other popular American band who delivers this kind of sweeping, larger-than-life sound.  Also, as a fan of Progressive and Symphonic metal, I really appreciate the huge choruses found on This is War.     I've read of people complaining about the children singing in the choruses, or that the music is too light or catchy, but this seems to bother only the people who require their music to be stagnantly heavy and unmelodic.  Most rock or metal bands tendto concentrate on a heavier sound in their infancy, but inevitably they discover that sonic riffing isn't necessarily required to produce powerful music.      The album has quickly risen to my list of favorites.  I would encourage anyone to give it a try since it has a timeless, genre-spanning quality that should appeal to all sorts of music lovers.     I just hope their next album is as good, or better.     (I hope they release a version of the album that still has Kanye West appearing on the song \\"Hurricane.\\"  I'm not a fan of West's, really, but he adds an interesting vibe to that song and I'm aware of it every time I listen to the version without him.)
B000KJU1MS|5.0|I, like everyone else, has their opinion of what should of been included in these dvd collections.  Mine would have been to have this all in one collection, keeping repetition down to a minimum.  That would mean selecting the best concerts in regards to audio and visual quality.  It would of had all the extra goodies, to be sure and just highlights from concerts of early years just so you get the idea.  But, Kiss being Kiss, wanted to give their fans a healthy dose even to the point of overload.  Don't get me wrong, i love everything in this dvd collection and it just demonstrates Kiss's tireless devotion to their fans.  Remember, a lot of the earlier footage was shot with no intention of releasing it commercially.  The video and audio is poor but still interesting and entertaining. There are a lot of bands who probably have stuff like this in their possession that their fans will never see.  Again, Kiss's devotion to their fans.

0061726826|4.0|Put me in the camp of those who weren't sure Lauren Oliver's next novel would top her debut Before I Fall.  I think with this one, she proven she has something to offer the young adult genre and will be here to stay.  While I have to say I didn't like it as much as Before I Fall, it is still one of the best books I've read this summer and right behind my 5 star books for the best of the year.  I highly recommend getting it as soon as it's released.<br /><br />I've really enjoyed books set in a future society.  Although, I'm not sure why it's always rigorously controlled by  whatever government system is in place.  It always works with the storyline though, and this one is no exception.  I think it's because everyone is so afraid to break the rules, that when they do it makes it that much more exciting.  I love how the characters believe they live in a Utopian society, when actually the opposite is probably true.  I do have to admit that for half the story I thought it took place in Portland, Oregon.  I had a hard time adjusting my thinking when I realized it was actually Portland, Maine.<br /><br />I grew to love Lena by the end of the story.  Some characters push the rules from the very beginning of the story.  Lena fights it every step of the way.  She's trying her best to be a model citizen and accept what's society has chosen to give her.  I think she hopes by doing this, she can overcome her own families failures.  She doesn't want to be different.  Alex is wonderful.  I knew what he was, but was surprise at how well he seemed to blend into society.  I loved how he pushed Lena into finding out what she really wanted.  He was always right there when he needed her most.  I also enjoyed watching Lena and Hanna's relationship evolve.  At first they were trying to accept how their relationship will be different after they are both cured by stepping away from each other before their operations.  But, then they realize that how they feel about their friendship now is just as important.<br /><br />The story itself is beautiful.  Oliver has a way with story telling that just captures you from the first pages.  I picked it up and finished it less than 24 hours later (I stopped to sleep lol).  The ending left me breathless and craving more.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is some of the ideas of this society weren't entirely believable to me.  The idea that people could be cured of loved but then expected to raise a family just didn't sit well with me (I didn't buy into the idea of not experiencing love would prevent such incidents as children being drowned in the bathtub as explained at one point).  I also was reminded greatly of Uglies by Scott Westerfeld.  The story lines were very similar.t.    The story itself is beautiful.

1423101499|2.0|Just so that we are all clear the two stars is for the shape I recieved the book in not because the book was bad.  I love the PJ&O series!<br /><br />Anyway, I have bought many books off amazon that have been used and were in wonderful shape.  Yes, they looked used.  MAtter of fact they look like a few people may have read them.  However, this book when I got it had a page torn out (it was still in the book but it was torn out), bent pages, and for the most disgusting part of it all food crumbs from someone else and not me stuck to the inside and over all just beat to crap.  I was surprised that someone would try to sell a used book that has not even been taken care of.  To me, it looked like a parent wanted some extra money so they saw that their kid had this book in his back pack for years took it out and sold it.<br /><br />Like I said I love this series and I have bought many used books on amazon.  I was simply just disappointed when I got this book and I felt like I had to sanatize it.  I wont be buying another book from this person that is for sure.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This includes the entire Planet Earth series that ran on television. I noticed others complaining that this didn't come with the \\"making of\\" videos, and they're correct, but I don't really care. If you don't have an HD TV with a Blu-Ray player, don't bother because this won't work for you. Great series!
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|One of the best albums I've purchased in recent years. With this album, Mumford and Sons produce rock n' roll with a country twist. There is a banjo that accompanies the other instruments, and helps to produce the foot tapping jams that are on this album. The album is a nice balance of rocking and mellow songs.
0312600844|2.0|I picked up this book upon Uncle Stevie's (Stephen King) recommendation that this was a fine piece of literary fiction. I had to give up at page 220. The long \\"autobiography\\", upwards of 150 pages, just did me in. I found that I didn't really care for the characters, in fact, I was sick of them.    Other reviewers have said that the book really becomes fabulous in the second half. Unfortunately, I just couldn't get there. And I really, really tried.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|The Series continues and adds more mystery.  Just think X-Files with hot guys and no government conspiracy. Love it.
B0042RJWTM|5.0|A \\"must have\\" for movie fans, Lee Marvin fans and western fans alike. I have but one complaint:     WHAT TOOK SO LONG?      Fans of great westerns, great movies in general for that matter, have been clamoring for MONTE WALSH on DVD for years. It's a \\"No frills\\" DVD, the only \\"extra\\" included is the trailer. That said, I'm happy to be able to add it to my library. The DVD looks terrific. A great movie beautifully written, filmed, acted and scored.       So, what are you waiting for?
B00328G4Y8|5.0|In today's generation, where Lady Gaga and Taylor Swift dominate the radio, I'm so glad that I've found many alternatives (one of them being the legendary Jimi Hendrix and The Jimi Hendrix Experience). After the first album, Are You Experienced, in comes Axis: Bold as Love. This is a stunningly satisfying album that you just HAVE to listen from beginning to end. Every track on this album (even the non-musical opener \\"EXP\\") is something of a marvel. Songs like \\"Little Wing,\\" \\"Wait Until Tomorrow,\\" and \\"If 6 was 9\\" are solid gold. \\"One Rainy Wish,\\" my personal favorite on the album, is undoubtedly one of the greatest from Hendrix. \\"She's So Fine,\\" the only song on this album sung by Noel Redding, is musically rich and lyrically entrancing. \\"Little Miss Lover\\" is a little off here and there, but it's great nonetheless.<br /><br />I'm 23 years old, but I wish I became a fan of Jimi Hendrix much MUCH sooner. This is awe-inspiring, sometimes godly, rock music.<br /><br />Grade: 9.9/10

014241543X|5.0|Copied from my blog: [...]<br /><br />Wow!  If I Stay left me completely speechless.  Gayle Forman is one amazing writer and If I Stay is a beautiful book.<br /><br />Mia Hall though it was going to be a good day; no school and a family outing.  What could be better?  Things take a turn for the worse though when Mia and her family are in a devastating car crash and Mia is left in a coma.  Life doesn't look so great for her anymore.  Things will never be the same.  Still, she has a choice to make.  Should she stay or should she go?<br /><br />If I Stay is probably one of the saddest books that I have ever read.  I knew when I started it that it wasn't going to be your happily-ever-after but I had no idea how much I would cry.  Still, it is one of the most beautifully written books that I have ever read and I can't help but recommend it.<br /><br />The way it's written is different but it was a great way to show all the characters, not just Mia.  Stories are told through flashbacks of Mia's memories and every memory showed something new about Mia and her loved ones.  It wasn't hard to get drawn into the story.<br /><br />Overall, If I Stay is a book that I highly recommend to everyone, young and old.  I know for a fact that my mom loved it too and she is a very picky reader.  I just know that everyone will find something to love about this book.  I can't believe I waited this long to read it.
B00006LFGD|5.0|Ever since I heard her voice I've been a fan of Barbra Streisand; she has that unique tone in her voice that touches me whenever I listen to her music.  I bought this CD as a gift and I hope the person enjoyed the music as much as I do.   This CD is a must have.

0312427999|4.0|I picked up this book based on a few recommendations and I'm glad that I did. Without this book I wouldn't have the opinion of free-market capitalism that I do now: that it is not the way to go about restructuring a government - or perhaps that it would be if a \\"shock\\" was necessary every time.<br /><br />I read with horror as the same thing that happened to Chile in the 70s happened to Iraq (and is why the war has gone on for as long as it has) just a few short years ago. It even happened in our own country with the reconstruction of New Orleans. I now have a new fear of the word reconstruction.<br /><br />Don't be fooled though, the material here, while great, is dense and can be hard to get through at times. I read this book in stages but powered through the last 250 pages. All in all I finished 5 other books while reading this book and having just finished it (beginning of February) I did start reading it at the beginning of this past November.<br /><br />The book covers the shocks to Chile, Argentina, Bolivia, Poland, Russia, Iraq, post Katrina New Orleans, Sri Lanka and Israel. With each passing shock over the roughly fifty year span your jaw will get closer and closer to the floor.

B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I love love loved it it was fun action pack and a hint of humor. RED (Retired Extremely Dangerous) that pretty much describe Bruce alright . Not much to say but the minute they came to Bruce house and try to kill him the movie had me since that moment. If your a Bruce Willis fan then you won't be disappointed and of course his other co stars. Best way to describe it it's like Ocean's twelve meets Die Hard.<br /><br />When the actors in this has been accomplish as they have with all having a great and impressive resume it's good to see them let Lose and have fun with a good fun, humor action movie.
1439156816|5.0|I have not now nor ever been a fan of Stephen King's fiction, nor do I intend to change that pattern. His personal brand of fiction is simply not for me. But since this book is non-fiction, curiosity got the better of me. I am glad that I read this book very much, for both the memoir of his writing life, as well as the writing skills he attempts to impart.<br />The first half of the book is largely a memoir of King's life, with a focus on his writing career. The reader learns things such as what inspired him, what he liked in fiction, his initial forays into getting published, as well as his many rejections and criticisms. I found it both interesting and ironic that his first big book, Carrie, was accomplished largely thanks to his wife's encouragement, as he never really cared for the main character. He could take the simplest ideas, put two random thoughts together, and make them into these successful stories. All of this is woven into the more mundane aspects of his life, from schooling, to various jobs, to meeting his future wife.<br />The second part of the book is all about what King considers good writing practices, as well some of the advice that King has received over the years, such as when writing a second draft, subtract 10% from the original. He even goes into the details of good grammar and repeatedly refers to Strunk and White's The Elements of Style. He finishes off this section by showing a section of a first draft he wrote, and then the edited second draft of it to give the reader an idea of how to approach the editing process.<br />A final section in the book goes into the details of when King was hit and nearly killed by a \\"blue van\\" and the effect that it had on his life and his writing. The accident actually occurs before he begins the second part of this book, giving the manuscript the possibility of never being completed. This was probably the most intriguing part of the book for me, as he was able to remember in vivid detail what happened to him, and yet he seemed to be oddly emotionally-detached from its long-term consequences for his life. There is only one short paragraph in which I actually pick up on some emotion, when he discusses how quickly the driver of the blue van will likely be returning to the road. At one point he also made the observation that the driver could have stepped from the pages of one of his novels. What I do love is that his passion for writing helped him to overcome his injuries and regenerate that need to keep putting words to the page.et he seemed to be oddly emotionally-detached from its long-term consequences for his life.

B002N5N5M0|4.0|this season was really engaging that think Dexter has grown alot and now with a family he has to learn how to balancing work, family and is work on the side. I love the bad guy in this season I think they did a good job and he did give Dexter a little challenged. Didnt like the way it ended but i guess thats the way it is. Towards of the end of the last episode i kept saying No, No No No.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|Loved the story and the incorporation of Greek legends.  I read the books passed them on then bought them again for my niece.
B003PIUBZS|4.0|this show is not for the faint of hearts, horrifying killings,blood,and violence  nudity upon nudity and the only bad thing I did not like the graphics could be a little better. This will be a great new show and watching the 2nd season now. And i hope the lead from the first season really gets well soon sad to hear he got cancer of the first season was shot.Get well soon.
1400079276|5.0|Excellent read. Explores the world of dreams, family, talking cats and a multitude of other mysteries and wonder. Suggested read for sure.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|Great show something different on tv a biker gang sometimes bad sometimes good, who looks out for each other even their women have attitudes and are bad chicks . I love FX pick of tv shows and they keep bringing something different.
0316096199|5.0|I don't normally review books that have been reviewed 287 times before, but I just finished reading this book and think that the writing is astonishing.  It is a grim subject.  I am male and a decade older than the author, and who in my demographic reads a book about rape?  I ingested about 200 miligrams of Zoloft to get through this book in two days, but you know what, her writing is truly beautiful.  She has a talent for capturing genuine emotion.  I could not put it down.  Maybe she learned it from Tobias Wolff, or maybe she learned it on her own, but Alice Seybold writes from the heart.  I rate this book an 8 on the scale where there is no higher than 10, and I rate her other work, Lovely Bones, a 10.  She is one of the best writers that there is.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I love Dexter, who knew being so bad could be so good. love the concept of the show, its something different for me to watch with all the detective shows out there. Would most surely recommend. The show is about a serial killer who only kills bad people and serial killers.
B0040HJNKC|4.0|This dude is 74 years young and rocks like a youngster, what a great sound.  The guitar licks are simply great and is definately up there with the best.  The voice is not too bad either and certainly does the job.  A real good cd to listen too, add this to your collections.
B003CN5SAY|4.0|I JUST REVIEWED season 1 but i won't rate all seasons except 6. I will say this for seasons 2,3,4,5 that sometimes the direction went a little bad the show is good but sometimes i feel as the season goes on it loses its appeal, there are some good episodes but not all were good. Amber she really needs love i found her very attractive throughout the seasons and does add a little something to the cast. the whole family went all over the place.<br /><br />SEASON 6<br /> it finish ok not what i wanted but a decent finish to the series.through out the season i've seen people ask for the weirdest procedure.<br /><br />TELL ME WHAT YOU DON'T LIKE ABOUT YOURSELF. i will miss hearing that.
B0041TW5WC|4.0|I've been a longtime a-ha fan since 1985 and \\"Take On Me\\"...saw their farewell tour in NYC in 2010, \\"ending on a high note\\" indeed.  Before the tour, Rhino/Warner finally released in the US their 2004 compilation \\"Singles 1984-2004\\", which was fine, but as this was the farewell tour, and I heard a compilation/boxset would be released covering their whole career, Warners and Universal stuff combined, and here it is...\\"25\\", in 3 versions, the standard 2CD, a Japanese 2CD set with a completely different...fan-selected...tracklisting, and this, the Deluxe triple consisting of the standard 2CDs and a DVD of 17 vidclips...that's the one I purchased, as I had no a-ha on DVD, and this looks like a companion piece to the \\"Headlines & Deadlines\\" DVD, as most of the clips on it are post-1991, with standards and rarities and a missing clip from earlier, including the new vidclip of their final single \\"Butterfly Butterfly (The Last Hurrah)\\".<br /><br />Before I start, 2 questions...why \\"25\\" is not being released in the US at all???  Is it because of unavailability of licensing of tracks from their 2 Universal albums \\"Analogue\\" and \\"Foot Of The Mountain\\"???  Is this because of this reason that Rhino/Warner released (finally and late??) in the US the 2004 comp \\"Singles 1984-2004\\"???  Otherwise, why release that when knowingly \\"25\\" was ready to go??  And speaking of those 2 albums, why were there NO CLIPS from those albums on the DVD???  They have the songs, why no clips??  Strange.<br /><br />Now, as for the 2CDs, I say SHEER perfection...remastering and song selection, the right versions (\\"Move To Memphis 1991\\", \\"The Blood That Moves The Body 1992\\"), many of their best non-single album tracks (\\"Scoundrel Days\\", \\"The Swing Of Things\\", \\"Slender Frame\\") AND non-album singles (the 1991 \\"Move To Memphis\\", \\"Shapes That Go Together\\", the new \\"Butterfly Butterfly (The Last Hurrah)\\")!!!  It's like the whole of the 2CDs was made to order for me, as if I was contacted and consulted in putting this together...sheer perfection and a clearcut way to explain to in-the-dark Americans why a-ha MATTER and got the shaft in American media, that they were unfairly tagged a 1-hit wonder joke, and are clear innovators of beautifully epic, intricate, dark, melancholic, widescreen pop that clearly influenced bands like Coldplay and Keane, and that even U2 tipped their hats to this groundbreaking Norwegian trio in \\"Beautiful Day\\", a nod to their 1985 #20 pop hit (in the US belying their 1-hit-wonder status here) \\"The Sun Always Shines On TV\\", one of their best (if not their very best) songs...sheer perfection.<br /><br />As for the DVD...it's meant to be a post-\\"Headlines & Deadlines\\" companion piece...and for the most part, it's awesome, with most of the clips post-1991, with a few classic clips and rarities like alt-cuts of their 1990 Carole King/Everly's cover of \\"Crying In The Rain\\" which has the band in it mostly, and the original 1984 clip of \\"Take On Me\\", interesting and cool...but it all stops with the clip of \\"The Sun Always Shines On TV\\", wow, whoever did that should be fired pronto!!!  They used the wrong music track (the album version, not the single version) and had the music and video track badly jumpcut right when Morten starts to sing/mime...REALLY bad...and no excuse as the \\"Headlines & Deadlines\\" video/DVD did not have this problem...THEN what's really weird/odd is after the clip ends, it goes into the US National Anthem and video as if it's an end of a broadcast day in the 70s, the TV is about to go off the air into static, with US scenery and a US flag in the middle of the screen!!!  Like, HUH???  Where did they get THAT???  And why is it on an a-ha DVD...a NORWEGIAN band?????  Was it an American nationalist, is it a druggy sign of things to come????  Is this an alien invasion???  Am I here??  It sorta mirrors the 1969-era moon exploration clip of \\"Minor Earth Major Sky\\", with the US flag-planting, but in all the wrong ways.  Totally surreal andkinda funny, but completely WRONG and misplaced.  Whoever was responsible should be fired, immediately.  Then, the print of \\"Take On Me\\" was possibly damaged, as for a splitsecond, the closeup of Bunty Bailey's face in the opening scene post-animation was either worn or had some dirt on the print, but it's only a quick splitsecond, no biggie...and the clip of 1986's \\"I've Been Losing You\\" (missing from \\"Headlines\\") had all-over-the-place editing...horrible job but that was prob the original vidclip.  I'm just happy the 1991 clip of \\"Move To Memphis\\" is on there, perfect and untouched...that clip is pure sex...the hot girl, water, S&M imagery, plastic...pure sex...even the guys had that mood going on, Morten in Elvis mode, long hair and all.<br /><br />So overall, 4 stars...docked a star for the bad editing botch job on the DVD...everything else was perfect...not sure if Rhino will be able to fix the DVD, but I doubt it.ely WRONG and misplaced.

B004DK5CW4|3.0|SECRETARIAT is a solid Disney film for families about the importance of god sportsmanship and the devotion of people to animals and the bonding that can take place.  Based on William Nack's book SECRETARIAT: THE MAKING OF A CHAMPION and adapted for the screen by Mike Rich the film is a solid biography of a great horse and an even more interesting statement about women surviving and excelling in a 'man's world' of sports.  as directed by Randall Wallace the film takes care to develop the history of the great horse, from before his birth through the birthing process, the training and the exhilaration of triumph. The time frame of the story is well captured and the cast delivers solid performances.  Diane Lane (in a somewhat unusual role for her0 is the owner Penny Chenery who takes over her father's horse ranch - Chris Chenery is portrayed by Scott Glenn - and the important contributors to the growth and subsequent fame of the horse are John Malkovich (playing John Malkovich assuming the role of Lucien Laurin) and the redoubtable Margo Martindale as Miss Ham.<br /><br />This film will appeal to audiences who love biographies, especially those of animals.  There is a fine sense of delivery of this interesting tale but somehow it never catches fire and seems longer than its 123 minutes.  The reason to watch this film may very well be to watch the true star of the film - the horse 'Big Red' AKA Secretariat.  Grady Harp, February 11
B003Q6D27S|2.0|Most of this movie was so bad I'm not going to waste much time on this review because the movie itself already did that for me, so I'm just gonna put into bullet points why this movie sucks:  - pink blood  - traps were mostly stupid  - acting was roughly as good as a soap opera  - most of the movie had absolutely nothing to do with the other six  The only saving grace of this movie is the last 15 minutes of the movie where they try to wrap up the other six. It could've easily been tacked onto to the end of Saw 6 though.  Uggghhh...
B000KITQK2|5.0|Use with my Epiphone Masterbilt with K&K Pure Western Mini pickup.  It sounds like my actual guitar through a PA.  Also sounds great from the unbalanced out straight into my MacBook Pro/Garageband.    Can't beat the sound for under $30.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I joined a weight loss challenge at work and decided to get this DVD to help whip my body into shape. I thought, if doing this workout will make my body look like Jillian's then I'm in.   I did this workout the first day and thought I would die. I was swearing at the TV, sweating to death, gasping for air, and my legs felt like jello. But I stuck with it. Now, I'm on day 13 and it is definitely getting easier. I've been eating healthier, doing pilates in the mornings, and shredding in the evenings after work. I have lost 15 pounds in 4 weeks! Woo!  Jillian really kicks your butt with her 3-2-1 system. I like the fact that there are modified and challenging versions of the moves. Some of the moves I could do at the challenging level and others I followed the easier versions...made all the moves do-able. Breaking the movements down to 30 second segments really works for me. It's long enough to make an impact, but not so long that you get over-worked in one area. It makes me push myself to try to do the entire 30 seconds.  I have read some of the other reviews and noticed a lot of people feel knee pains. My thought is to make sure you are doing this properly. Have someone watch how you are doing the movements. While doing the workout my boyfriend sometimes watches. When I thought I was doing the moves correctly, he would stop me and show me that I was actually doing them wrong. For example, When I would do lunges or squats I wasn't pushing my butt out, which was causing my knees to go past my ankles...which can lead to knee pain. It has helped a lot, and I feel confident that now I'm doing the moves correctly.   As for the reviews on that fact that you need 48 hours in between strength-training workouts...folks, it's 9 minutes total of strengthening! If you are doing an entire workout of strength-training that rule may apply. I don't think that b/c Jillian does a few minutes of strength-training each workout means she doesn't know what she's talking about. Look at herbody, and the results of the people she has helped...speaks for itself. Sounds more like an excuse, but that's just me.   Overall, I am very happy with my purchase, it's working for me. I will continue to use it and lose weight!!
B0000669JL|5.0|I bought this album for my wife as a Christmas present, and she enjoys it.  She even thanked me again recently for getting it for her, because she had listened to it again that day and enjoyed it again!
B004CEUEWE|5.0|Superb movie. Great plot and action. All the characters were good and had enough development. I'm certainly not an Affleck fan, in general, and I thought Gone Baby Gone was a flaming turd (along with his brother); but this movie is the complete package. Renner should get an Oscar.
B003L20IJM|3.0|This sequent definitely wasn't as good as the original.  Nonetheless, it was certainly cute and entertaining. The ending was predictable, and the change of the children wasn't as fun as in the first movie.
0307593525|5.0|I have wanted this set for such a long time. I look forward to beginning my journey into French cooking!
B003XL6EKS|5.0|I'm the kind of person who doesn't buy CD's. I have an incredibly small CD collection, and no, it's not a bunch of Killers CD's. Don't get me wrong, I love The Killers. I'm a huge fan, but my point is I didn't just buy this because it was Brandon Flowers. This is one of the very few CD's that I felt it was necessary to buy. Usually I just go for a digital download or something along those lines, but this I felt it was necessary that I own it.     On this Album Brandon Flowers does his own thing for sure, but I still feel that it has a bit of that Killers flair. So if you're looking for something to sound exactly like what you've been hearing on previous Killers albums, you might be disappointed. If you're looking for something great, and something that has the same sort of feel as what you've heard on Killers albums, you might find yourself enjoying this CD. Like on previous Killers albums, the lyrics are compelling, and the sound is original.     I disagree with the reviews saying that the only decent song on here is \\"Crossfire\\". Although it's one of my favorites on the album, it's certainly not all the album has to offer. The album opens with \\"Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas\\". This does a great job of setting the tone for the CD. Some of my other favorite tracks would have to be \\"Jilted Lovers & Broken Hearts\\" \\"Magdalena\\" \\"On the Floor\\" and \\"Swallow it\\".     I STRONGLY suggest buying the Deluxe Edition for the bonus tracks. I LOVE all four of them. Though \\"The Clock was Tickin'\\" has a different sound that might not be appealing to some, it's lyrics are incredible. I wasn't the biggest fan of that one at first, but it grew on me considerably and is now one of my favorite tracks. The other three I loved instantly.
B0032JTV6U|5.0|From the Pilot episode in 2009, I have loved Glee. Clever writing, likable and despicable characters, amazing performances... oh my! Love it or hate it, Glee is here to stay. The First Season truly left its mark on young and old fans alike.  This DVD set is one you can watch time and time again - it can make you laugh and make you cry. There aren't many TV show boxed sets I'd want to own, but this was a must-have and I plan on adding more seasons to my collection. Buy it!
B001N1DPDE|5.0|My first BK2 was simply outstanding (with the replacement grips).  After a season, I purchased one for each of my friends.  Excellent do it all knives from Becker that won't disapoint.  Save the money you would have thrown away on one of those expensive fad knives and purchase one of these true workhorses.  You won't be disappointed!
B000TGCR38|5.0|I took my grandfather to see this movie last year. It reminded him of WW2 in Holland that happened when he was a young man. Great movie. I like it as well.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved it ffrom the start. Collins is just so creative with how the world will be in the not so distant future. I didnt want to put it down ever. Get this book.
B00406UK7S|4.0|This is a good story with good actors and characters. The one drawback for me was that it reminded me of good books that needed better editors.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|Well, what can I say?  I loved this movie/musical from the first time I saw it in the Theatres.  Based on the Brothers Grimm fairy tale, this animated musical that later became a Broadway Stage hit, is a true classic.  The music was written by the team of Howard Ashman and Alan Menken, who also did Little Mermaid, and Little Shop of Horrors.  Howard Ashman died shortly after this film was released.  This movie is about a young maiden named Belle who loves to read and eventually has to rescue her father from an enchanted castle where an evil prince has been transformed to a beast, and the subjects have been transformed into clocks, candlesticks and other objects.  And if the spell can only be broken if he can fall in love before his 21st year.    What I love about this movie, I think is the romance, Jerry Orbach's charisma as the Lumiere, and of course Paige O'Hara's golden voice.  For several years I still had my VHS copy from childhood, but no VCR to play it on anymore.  And for Christmas my Aunt gave it to me for when I have children.  I'm not married yet, but eventually.  I just can't get enough of it.  It brings back so many memories.  I also love \\"BE Our Guest.\\"  Jerry Orbach does a great version of it.  I will alway remember how heartbroken I was when Mr. Orbach died of colon cancer.  Goodness, what a horrible loss!  Also, the scene when the Beast releases Belle to go see her sick father makes me cry every time I watch it.    All in all, this is a wonderful movie from ages nothing to not telling.  So add it to your collection before Disney puts it back in the vaults!
1596680296|5.0|This book was very helpful to me.  I have tried to knit socks on my own several times, but always got stuck when it was time to join the gusset.  The illustrations are easy to follow and I was able to find where I was making errors and correct them, all by myself!  I highly recommend this book.
031603438X|5.0|Funny, but ever since I finished \\"Life\\" I've rediscovered my love for music. I've been listening to Muddy, Roy Orbison, John Lee Hooker, Elvis, classic country, etc. Of course I also send plenty of time listening to The Stones. If there is only one thing you take away from Keith's book, it's that music is as essential to his life as air is to the rest of us. Sure, there are the drugs, the women, the wild parties and adventures, but in the center of it all there is just a guy and his guitar. Keith Richards, the epitome of Rock and Roll!
B0015DROBO|4.0|Though this book had a slow start, it was worth it.  I started reading it, and then started again.  You have to give it a chance.  I was impressed.  We even watched the video because it was something i wanted to compare to the book.  Try it out.
1400079144|2.0|This book is almost embarrassing to read!  The villainy is so cartoony, its almost like Dr. Evil in Austin Powers.  Instead of actually using writing to express emotion, the characters, every single one of them, talk with a double exclamation point or a \\"!?\\"   Are you kidding me?!  What kind of writing is that? I get the feeling the author fancies himself as the main character, as he describes him wearing exactly what Dan Brown wears in author photos. The story is okay- too bad its not executed very well. The bad writing is just distracting.
030745455X|5.0|Wow...I could not put it down.  I was impressed.  If you enjoyed the first book by Larsson, this was even better.  I don't like all the mannnnny characters, but what a read!  This is a must read.  I hope I am able to see this video too.
B0041T4ML4|5.0|The Windup Girl is a wonderfully well written novel with a great setting, interesting and believable characters, and original and fantastic ideas.  The story, however, is not quite on par with the rest of the aspects of the novel, but it is passable and does not detract from the reading experience (I only note this because if the story was at the same level as the rest of the novel then it would be an instant classic).
0316098337|4.0|While I agree it was much too quick a read and that the second half was a tad boring, I thought the author did an incredible job writing from the point of view of a young child within a tiny world.     The one-star reviewers complain that the child has a strange sentence structure and that the abduction and relationship between Ma and Old Nick are not touched upon enough... Guess what? That's all part of Ma's story, and this is not Ma's story. This is Jack's story, a little boy whose only contact in this world is his mother and a couple of channels on a television. Of course his sentence structure would be off... he doesn't know any better. Without any social interaction, he can only pick up what he hears from his mother and the television.     The first half of the book had my heart fluttering in anticipation. I couldn't believe that a book could evoke such emotion. This is all Jack knows, so of course he sees it as pleasant rather than a hellish prison, as his mother sees it. If it's all you know, you have nothing to compare it to and therefore cannot see it as either better or worse than anything else.    I would recommend this novel to anyone, but understand that it's a VERY fast read. I started and finished it the day I got it.
B002SVBDYQ|4.0|I bought this cd despite the less than enthusiastic reviews because I'm just grasping at anything Twilight, and especially music.  I have to say, at first, I couldn't get into it - it is quiet and pretty subtle.  But I've seen the movie a couple more times (yeah, really) and listened to the music a bit more, and it is really growing on me.  Well crafted, sensitive, and really perfectly appropriate to the movie.  If you like the other Twilight soundtracks, and you give it a chance, it will probably grow on you...
B002RKSXJG|5.0|I enjoyed this story very much, especially since it was written by the \\"author of the modern mystery\\".  It was thrilling and difficult to put down, and was a fascinating glimpse into the view of society in the 1850's (thereabouts)--especially the views of women and the law.
B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|We saw The Band Perry in concert last night. AMAZING LIVE SHOW. These guys keep it energized and fresh. They are not the stereotypical country band/singer. Oh, and she wears some fierce boots! The cd is pretty cool. I didn't love every song on the album, but who usually does. Most of the songs ended up growing on me. After seeing them live...I enjoy the cd even more now. Give them a listen and decide for yourself.
B0042KZJ46|5.0|hello everybody ,   i hope you guys enjoy the new release , great songs of course but what i am wondering does it exist on DVD concert?  i had seen it already and i own a vhs tape but i want to buy the dvd.
0756405890|5.0|A friend recommended this book to me and based on the description I thought, \\"This isn't for me.\\" Thank God he pushed. I finished this book in 4 days. I've since gotten about a dozen other friends to read it. Don't go into this thinking \\"I don't like fantasy\\", go into this thinking \\"I really need a good book to read.\\" Period. The sequel/continuation is due to hit store shelves in about a month and I really can't wait.
B0016Q2D5M|4.0|This is a good action adventure flick for the entire family.. I personally bought this for my mom because she loves this film and so does my nephew.. It is good movie worth a purchase really if you like Brenden Fraiser and if you have seen the old classic Journey to the center of the earth then by all means purchase this item.. =)
B001EN71CW|5.0|I'm sure you've heard it all before- what a great series this was, how tragic it only lasted one season. I'm not going to rehash any of that. I'll just say this- If you like good sci-fi, then you'll love this.<br /><br />I already owned the DVD release, but the Bluray version (besides having fewer discs) looks and sounds incredible. And for the price, can't be beat.
B004EAQNO4|4.0|I glanced over this movie in the Redbox several times before finally checking out the description and when I saw M. Night's name, I knew I had to give this movie a try.  I love The Sixth Sense, Signs, and The Village.  Each of them is creepy and enigmatic in their own right.  This movie is along the same lines.  The chilling suspense leaves you jumping and wondering what will happen next.  Imagine being stuck in an elevator with the devil and when the lights turn off, you have no idea who will be the next one to get hurt!  The cast is not very well known, but this leaves the plot open to the mystery it needs to create a good background.  I was caught off guard by the ending as it did not happen the way I expected.  I've watched it three times already!
B002U0KHMY|5.0|We were pleasantly surprised to watch a show where the police/detective isn't a bumbling fool and where he has a good wife/relationship--a wife who understands that her husband's job is important and doesn't feel neglected when he has to come home late, &/or misses dinner.    We definitely like this show. We just wish it were on regular TV because we don't have cable and had to rent the First Season.
1401323952|5.0|This book was an impulse by at my local, used bookstore (sorry Amazon!) and so far I've been impressed with it. The tarragon chicken was a hit and totally easy to make! Note: white pepper is really expensive and only really used for appearance sake. Use black pepper and the recipe will be just as good.      I also made the coconut and cherry banana bread, and she's right, it's not much to look it, but it's excellent with a smear of warm butter. I even doubled the recipe and it came out perfect.     The book also has some fun recipes, such as the blackberry vodka. No, it's not quick but it seems very easy and I look forward to making it. I also love the 'making leftovers right' section that follows some of the recipes. I'm not a big fan of leftovers, but her tips make the original meal a completely different dish, complete with new flavors.     One thing I've noticed in reviews about Nigella's books is that some of the ingredients can be hard to find. My thoughts on this are: Google is your friend. There are lots of perfectly good substitutes for obscure and/or expensive ingredients (see my note about white pepper). Also, ask your grocery store manager if it's possible to order the ingredient from another, more well stocked store. The worst they can say is no.     I'm very pleased with my purchase and plan on adding more of her books to my collection.
B003Q6D2BE|5.0|I didn't know what to expect with this movie when I sat down to watch it. I found the story to be engaging and funny. The action was awesome and kept me fascinated with some of the action they did. It is a very fun story and I highly recommend watching this movie. I actually have bought it so if you are considering buying it-BUY IT. You will love the movie!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Started reading the book after seeing it recommended on Facebook.  Couldn't stop reading it 'til I finished all three books.  The characters are well-developed and the plot is the perfect combination of what we know now and what we can envision in the future.  As soon as I started reading, I knew this would be the perfect series for a movie.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|I first read the book for lack of anything else on a plane. Once I really let myself read it and absorb it, I LOVED IT. It is the most amazing book, and I wish more people read it and lived by it. I own the physical book, the audio book, kindle version and the movie. It will change your life IF you read it and apply it.
B000V5TV22|5.0|Bought to replace the awful LT-20 GPS receiver that came with Delorme Streets and Trips.  Although Delorme makes a newer model, LT-40, for about the same price, I decided that Delorme, by putting an inferior product on the market, had not earned my trust and got this instead.  I was not disappointed, this product picks up the GPS in a heartbeat and has never dropped it yet.      The one negative is that this GPS uses a COM port.  The Delorme software does not pick up the COM port if the program is open, you have to plug in the GPS before opening the software.  This can be a pain if you need to take the laptop out of your car at a rest stop and plug the GPS back in.  The workaround is to put the laptop on standby before you unplug the GPS and plug the GPS back in before you bring it out of standby.  Still a pain, you either can't use your laptop or have to restart the program, but this is not entirely the fault of the GPS, Delorme does not have support for this particular GPS.    As to the user who had trouble getting this to work on Windows 7.  I went to the web site, downloaded the latest version of the software, installed it, plugged in the GPS, opened the software, set for Generic and 4800 baud and it worked.
0321701763|5.0|This is a fabulous instruction manual for those of you who, like me, have difficulty learning from \\"How To\\" books.  It is clearly written with illustrations everywhere to keep you on track.  Occasionally information is left out, like where to find certain tools, but you can look that info up in the index.  The lessons are challenging and interesting, and though I know CS3 quite well, I have learned SO much I didn't know before. It is written in layman's language, so puzzling over Adobe's annoyingly clever tech-speak is not a problem. I highly recommend \\"Classroom in a Book\\" to those of you who are serious about learning and are willing to diligently complete every chapter.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|One of the best guitar players I have ever seen! Great buy! I would recommend this site and product to anyone who enjoys great guitar performances!
030746363X|5.0|This book is changing my life! I would recommend this book to anyone! I am doing the slow-carb diet right now and plan on doing the muscle gain and breath holding chapters. I normally do not read at all. I couldn't put this book down. Chapters are small enough to finish in a few hours, even at low reading speeds like mine.
0451527046|5.0|Treasure Island is a rip roaring adventure tale full of treasure (surprise), pirates, and action.  Narrated by young Jim Hawkins, Treasure Island is nonstop fun.      Jim is the son of innkeepers when a mean and nasty sailor (we soon learn he is a pirate) walks in and captures Jim's imagination.  When the pirate dies (after two run-ins with pirates from his former ship that have tracked him down) Jim finds a treasure map and is chased by the same band of pirates.  This leads Jim to take the map and with his allies attempt to track the treasure down.  Complications arise including mutiny that force Jim to grow up and leads him to the adventure of a lifetime.    This was a really fun book to read and is a true page turner throughout.  Treasure Island gave us Long John Silver, Yo ho-ho and a bottle of rum, a talking parrot on a pirate's shoulder, pirates with a wooden leg, and a treasure map with an X.
030746363X|1.0|I purchased the audio book format and was given the hardback as well.  After reading through the exercise portion of the program, I decided it was a little too extreme for me and decided to do just the diet portion, especially after the quotes from others who had tried just the diet and lost inches right away.  I wasn't looking to lose 20 pounds in 30 days, just 5 or 10.      I am heading into my 28th day of the diet program and I have seen not the tiniest fragment of an inch drop away, nor seen the scale do anything but its usual vacillating between 133 and 136.  I've been rigorous and intentional from start to finish and am concluding the diet two days early on the grounds that scales and measuring tapes do not lie; this diet does not work.
B0041KKYCY|5.0|I am originally from Georgia, USA, but now live in the UK and had to order the uncut U.S. version, as the UK version is not uncut. I had seen the uncut original a few times over the years, just as well, as apparently the uncut version of it is also unknown in the UK, too. I was really prepared to be shocked, appalled and grossed out, but I wasn't. The performances were all good and Sarah Butler was actually better as Jennifer Hills than Camille Keaton was in the original film. As strange as it sounds I felt that there was quite a bit of humor that permeates the film. The rapists are mostly portrayed as bumbling clowns that begin to fall apart when it appears things are not going as they planned. The make-up effects are excellent and not as over-the-top as I expected. Surprisingly, some of the violence actually takes place off screen and you have to use to your imagination a bit, which makes it all the more effective. The rape scenes are brutal and justifiably uncomfortable to watch. They certainly set the stage for the payback that is to come and it is very hard not to root for Jennifer as she takes her revenge. I don't feel that Sarah Butler's nudity was as gratuitous as that of Camille Keaton in the original film and it probably made it seem even more believeable as a result.
B003EYVXXW|2.0|I don't mind films taking some liberties with history if it improves the story - Kapur's Elizabeth is a good example. Timelines are greatly compressed, Robert Dudley (Earl of Leicester) is turned into a naive pretty boy (which he was not) and it's spiced up with some dramatic episodes that didn't happen (like Walsingham murdering Mary of Guise). But the story, cinematography, and portrayal of life in the Elizabethan court (especially the politics) are absorbing and completely credible.     Agora lost me when the young woman protagonist used a proposition of Euclid to \\"prove\\" that \\"we are all brothers\\". To a viewer who knows something about the history of science and philosophy, that was the last straw. But the plodding narrative style and series of two-dimensional characters spouting cliches already had me reaching for the Stop button.
0446569895|5.0|Whether you are a fan of his or not, this book is a MUST READ! I HAVE been a fan since the 60's (!), but recommend this to EVERYONE. Extremely entertaining and insightful. Some of the book is so funny, I had to take a break from certain pages, as I was totally losing control.....laughing so hard, I was crying! Some of the book is very sad, but for the most part, it really is a pretty good look at Ozzy. Or at least as best he recalls! LOL What an amazing life this man has had so far. Thank you Ozzy for sharing your story...... as well as the talent you were blessed with. You have MANY fans you will never meet..... including myself!
B001CW7MCY|4.0|If you are purchasing this, than you already know. This is Blackwater Park, Opeth's masterpiece, on vinyl. It is beautiful, especially with a pre-amp and a bass boost. It is a great purchase, and I highly recommend it. The only thing that I was displeased with, was that the outter rim of the disc seemed to be peeling. Additionally, a little bit of this peeled vinyl was on the record, which I did not notice, and the record was popping. I was able to simply remove it, so it is of little consequence, but was still irritating.
B002ZG99A4|4.0|If you like old school Action movies with lots of things that go boom, This is the one for you! Story is irrelevant. Just good old brute action. Great popcorn movie!
B004DMIIOG|5.0|I'm fortunate to live near an arthouse theater that has been having special screenings of Summer Wars (just got back from seeing it an hour ago, actually). It was shown in Japanese with subtitles, which was great. And I ended up being more than pleasantly surprised by the film, despite the fact that the film quality was dreadful (that had more to do with the theater than the movie). I'm therefore eagerly anticipating this blu-ray release, and highly recommend it (or the DVD version) to all anime connoisseurs. In fact, just two weeks prior I watched Evangelion 2.0 in the same theater, and while I'm a TREMENDOUS Eva otaku, I think SW beats it hands down. The sheer emotion of the characters really comes through in the film, and the interspersed cyber-battles are great fun.<br /><br />I do have to reiterate something that at least one other reviewer mentioned. The base plot of the movie is suspiciously similar to that of Digimon: The Movie (Digimon: Our War Game in Japan). Not a bad thing, and there's enough that's different about it that you won't think of it while you're watching. But it is eerie...
B0001I561E|5.0|I received this item right before Christmas just as promised! I was so worried that I wouldn't receive it on time but I did! Great Purchase!!!
0307473465|4.0|The Reader is a great book in part because of the literary traditions and associations with which it finds itself.  I was immediately reminded of Marguerite Duras' The Lover, which describes her youthful affair with a Chinese man, and is somewhat similar  not only in subject matter but also in tone:  there is an atmosphere of shadows, veils, floating memories, punctuated by arresting physical detail.  The Reader is a classic 'coming of age' story, which in this cultural context is also a part of the German Bildungsroman.  A meditation on the role of memory and search for truth personally is echoed by the search for truth in German society of the 1960s, which reminded me of my favorite movie of all time, Die Zweite Heimat.  However, this general motif of memory and truth is latent throughout the 20th Century, beginning with Proust, and is perhaps most urgent in Holocaust literature.  In Panorama, by Czech novelist H.G. Adler, a Jewish academic who survived Birkenau and Buchenwald, and the perils of representation his main character, Josef Kramer, observes how \\"unreal it is when one gets involved with past suffering,\\" because each person's experience is too intimate and terrible to be fully conveyed.  Ultimately, Adler writes, \\"one can see others but never reach them.\\"  That book chronicles the past in every traceable detail, while this one builds a story, many stories, actually, according to the narrator, but this is the one he settled upon.  In that regard, we also have to consider the 'reliability' of the narrator dealing truthfully with his own past, his own agenda or baggage.<br /><br />Inevitably, we're invited to ruminate on the crime of sexually abusing a minor, which isn't taken as seriously in this culture when an older woman 'seduces' a young man.  We don't know what the 'age of consent' is however in the Reader's world, and there is never any hint that 'legality' or discovery was a strong concern.<br /><br />It's also difficult to sort the issue of abuse to the phenomenon of being scarred by love, or something like it, the 'regular' abuse of a love affair gone bad.  The narrator observes that all's badly that ends badly, which is a variation of the Shakespearean observation that all's well that ends well.  Still, isn't in the case that all love affairs end badly, or in marriage.  Abuse or not, it is clear that an important relationship can have consequences both near and long term.  In the short term after the affair ends there is a \\"juxtaposition of callousness and extreme sensitivity seemed suspicious even to me.\\"  2.1  In the long term, the consequences are visited on his daughter Julia, because his ex-wife Gertrud compares badly.<br /><br />The most daring comparison is the experience of a love affair gone badly and the Holocaust:  \\"my love for Hanna was, in a way, the fate of my generation, a German fate, and...it was only more difficult for me to evade, more difficult for me to manage...\\" 3.1  And, \\"I wanted simultaneously to understand Hanna's crime and to condemn it.\\"  2.15  The \\"numbness\\" of the daughter who spent time in the camps and the narrator's \\"numbness\\" are compared explicitly.  The juxatposition of investigating Hanna's 'crime against love' and 'crime against humanity' is fascinating.  It is implied that the narrator's studious involvement with exposing German collaboration wit the Nazis made him feel that he \\"belonged, and that I was at peace with myself about what I was doing\\" in the seminar studying the camps, which alienated many. 3.1  It is more human to be able to relate to an individual, and it's difficult to relate to a huge number.  We feel the loss of one more than the loss of twenty million.  Even visiting the death camp, it was incomprehensible.  Is this self indulgent moral myopia, or a gateway to trying to understand the huge loss?  How do we face the incomprehensible in the most public, and the most private, of circumstances?<br /><br />A darkly amusing motif is the incapacity of conventional means of understanding or resolving these difficulties.  Philosophically, this is the case in the encounter of the narrator with his father, who failed to give him satisfying advice, and especially lawyers.  The trial which occupies most of the second section is filled with obfuscation of the truth.  Hanna in the dock seemed as lost as Meursault in the Stranger, caught up in the process of a society finding an explanation and finding someone blameworthy.<br /><br />Is the third section necessary? on the one hand yes, to understand the effects of the relationship. it wouldn't be a complete story.  but no, on the other, the story is complete as she is sentenced to life.  There would be no resolution of the relationship as it were, but wouldn't that have been a more honest assessment of the love affair, and even the larger question of the Holocaust in German society?  Although it may not be necessary to include III, it would be a different book entirely, and more truthful in a sense.  The least successful passages occur in the third section, where the author descends from showing to pontificating, as in 3.4, where there is a an extended meditation on escape, the past, the present and future.  That isn't to say that astute observations aren't continually made,e.g. about whether 'late' is 'too late', or the nature of handwriting, communication, reading, the distinction between 'light' notes withstnding the weight of 'actual closeness'.<br /><br />Finally, the title is intriguing.  This title boils the narrator down to a single function, the Reader.  It might be useful to consider a thought experiment of different titles.  The Lover.  The Student.  The Lawyer.  Of all these roles, this story focuses on this unique aspect of the relationship.  But, what about those young women that Hanna forced to read to her before she sent them off to their deaths?  Maybe this story is more properly 'A Reader.'  And, after all, we're the readers, too.ing or resolving these difficulties.  Philosophically, this is the case in the encounter of the narrator with his father, who failed to give him satisfying advice, and especially lawyers.  The trial which occupies most of the second section is filled with obfuscation of the truth.  Hanna in the dock seemed as lost as Meursault in the Stranger, caught up in the process of a society finding an explanation and finding someone blameworthy.    Is the third section necessary? on the one hand yes, to understand the effects of the relationship. it wouldn't be a complete story.  but no, on the other, the story is complete as she is sentenced to life.

Although it may not be necessary to include III, it would be a different book entirely, and more truthful in a sense.  The least successful passages occur in the third section, where the author descends from showing to pontificating, as in 3.4, where there is a an extended meditation on escape, the past, the present and future.  That isn't to say that astute observations aren't continually made,e.g. about whether 'late' is 'too late', or the nature of handwriting, communication, reading, the distinction between 'light' notes withstnding the weight of 'actual closeness'.    Finally, the title is intriguing.  This title boils the narrator down to a single function, the Reader.  It might be useful to consider a thought experiment of different titles.  The Lover.  The Student.  The Lawyer.  Of all these roles, this story focuses on this unique aspect of the relationship.  But, what about those young women that Hanna forced to read to her before she sent them off to their deaths?  Maybe this story is more properly 'A Reader.'  And, after all, we're the readers, too.

B003VWDOK2|2.0|Am re-reading this book on the Kindle (having lost my paper-back).<br /><br />Beautifully written book, but have to score it a 2 because all of the illustrations are missing.  In addition, it seems to have been scanned, converted to text and then not entirely successfully proof-read.  Surely there must be the original text-file somewhere.<br /><br />The occasional typo, no problem, but the lack of figures?
B004BLJQOK|5.0|really great vampire movie. Set in the 1980s and really made me feel like I was back in that time. Very sweet and scary all at once.
