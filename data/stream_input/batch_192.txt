B0069CZGUC|5|is always a thierry mugler fragrance fan, bought it cause they don't have this and other limited items where i stay. good there is amazon seller to buy these items.<br />but still there are other limited items i cannot find here.
B000C1UBCE|5|This is my first Burberry perfume. My aunt got me turned on to Burberry, with the Burberry plaid line. I love this scent, it's not fruity, it's lighter and less overpowering than its original scents. Got it for a great deal for under $40.
B009PBAEF6|4|My daughter loves this toothbrush and enjoys brushing her teeth with it.
B006OBXHKO|3|everything is great with this case but size is smaller than what it seems like on pic.
B00HNKXSZO|4|Great
B003E1IXGA|5|All good
B0039VOSPU|5|Well.. what can I say, it really cheap, like 20usd, but ladies tends to like this perfume, also this was a better present than a more expensive givenchy perfume(that hurts when you buy a expensive present and everyone prefer the cheap one), any way, you can't go wrong with this one.
B00DYZ7ZCO|5|Great razor, my third Braun razor and they get better every time. I am very pleased with the Braun Series as they seem to improve with each series. Would recommend this razor to anyone.
B00H4RQ7BI|1|I used the entire bottle and no difference at all.  Smells nice...
B00KDB4AGG|1|Tried this and didn't work for me. Maybe it's cause it didn't come with instructions and I had to YouTube how to use it, but I'm not impressed at all with the bad quality &#34;glue&#34;.
B00KA7YQ7G|5|This cream is gorgeous and really work for the wrinkles
B00435S0PK|5|Outstanding. Been using it for at least 10  years.  It's wonderful
B007SNGSFS|5|As advertised
B004UQ6Q62|5|Purchased to replace my 10-year-old Braun for underarm shaving since electric razors are gentler on the skin. Love it. So easy to clean.
B00A7KLMOG|5|everything you need.
B000OZI8IW|2|I bought this product along with the Mama mio stretch mark oil and had to stop using them both because they have such a strong, musky, overbearing scent. I loved the consistancy and soft feeling it gave my skin but i just could not stand the stong smell. It made me nausious even in my second trimester. For a company that makes products geared towards pregnant women, you would think they would know not to use such strong fragrances.
B004SSM396|4|Its ok. I was expecting a more purple shade but it's more of a red /wine shade.
B00GA96860|5|This is also a great product. Very durable,  need uv light to cure. Highly recommended.  This vendor has fabulous products for your nails. IBD  is the only one I use as it is safe with no issues. Thank you
B008RODQFM|2|This diffuser randomly turns off.  The first time I used it, it turned off within 40 minutes.  The second time I used it, it turned off after 20 minutes.  Then I've seen it turn off after 5 minutes.  Diffusers should continue to run until they are out of water.  I will be returning this device.
B001KQ391K|5|Kate's Magik is really special.  The quality of the jasmine oil in the moon goddess anointing oil is first rate.  Great for pregnant mothers, great for my little girl who wants to wear a little perfume.  Just makes you feel special! I love this line and I love this smell!
B003XUTLWW|4|Love that it's gluten free and organic, however the smell is way too strong for some. I smell like a thanksgiving candle. I love that smell, but some don't.
B001Y61TLS|5|The thing with Axe body sprays is that they smell great, but rarely smell like their shower gel counterpart. This was one of those rare instances. Fever body spray smells exactly like Fever shower gel. And they both smell great. A strong, citrus scent (but still a manly scent). One of my favorites.
B0086VI9LC|4|The fit and were the same as the original brush heads that you can buy in the stores.  It came is very basic package - not the plastic blister packaging you are used to - but just as good and cheaper!  There is a larger 8-pack that comes in a plastic blister pack that is a better deal though.
B000TXV3UE|5|excellent
B00I2NZEBC|3|This is an amazing product!!!! I just spray a little on right before using the flat iron and my hair does not frizz.  I love it!!
B003BOLINK|5|I give it five start since this is the only product my wife uses that doesn't cause any side effects/problems.<br />I wish they would have some Costco size container with this creme so I wouldn't have to buy this small one all the time.
B00Q2MYUHO|5|Works great. I purchased the 3 pack. Comes out as gel and forms into foam as you apply to your face.
B00006ANDK|4|Fills my need
B000G647Y8|2|I had this brush for about a year before the entire knot of hair fell out, despite proper care and storage (bristles down, gently shaken dry, all that). Great first brush, but for your second brush, spend a little more and get something good.
B006UET63C|4|Love the color, perfect for use as a base or itself.
B0085RZLR2|1|I was really hoping I would like these because of the price, but they were awful. The bristles are completely different than the name brand brush heads. They are made of a clear plastic material and not a standard toothbrush material. They did not clean my teeth at all. At all! They hurt my gums, too. I ended up tossing the brush head after one week of use and buying the name brand replacement heads.<br /><br />As some other reviews stated, these brush heads are crazy loud!<br /><br />I'm sorry I bought a two pack. I certainly didn't save any money when I had to throw the product away. Really disappointed. But, I guess you get what you pay for.
B001AO0WCG|5|Love Love Love !!! I purchaed the Moroccanoil because I have curly hair and wanted to get something to hydrate my hair.It is amazing my hair feels so healthy after I use it and it gets rid of the frizz.
B00HF3XSRW|5|Great to hold. It gives you better control of the razor when used in the shower
B001OS75VE|3|The scent did not seem as strong as I remember when buying it from our local Bath & Body Works store years ago.  But for someone who prefers a lotion with a light scent, this one is a great choice.
B007BOACLA|5|I really like this product and have noticed a difference in my skin. I used oil of Olay products for years and switched to this after my mom and sister let me try their sample.<br />I was hooked.<br />My skin is not as dull as before, a bit more even toned, and seems to be smoother and softer.<br />  It has worked for me!
B001OO4O5I|5|This product is a favorite of mine and not available locally. I was thrilled to find a supplier on Amazon and that they were available to purchase. Took the new bottle of polish to my nail tech last week and my manicure was spectacular using this brand new bottle. My shipment arrived in very good condition and very quickly. I couldn't have been happier!
B00DMBIHUY|5|Great product, heavy sweater - and now dry
B000AUIFCA|5|Does a great job of cleaning along the gum lines.
B00KSLK86M|5|Very good
B004FOKU8E|1|Nothing like the LaCross tweezers I remember from years back.  Very difficult to grasp the hair. I would not buy these again.  Save your money and look for something else.
B00763LZWQ|1|we didn't like was way too hard.
B00AX3YNPC|4|My wife has used a number of Braun Epilators over the years.  Her most recent one was a Braun Series 7- 7181 [[ASIN:B0077PLNB6 Braun Series 7-7181 Silk Epil Wet & Dry Epilator 1 Count]] that proved to be a 5 star product.  This Braun Se7921 is identical to the 7181 except that it comes with a brush head attachment for exfoliation.  The price is about $20-30 dollars more than the 7181.  So is the extra cost worth it?  While the brush attachment does leave the skin on her legs looking more smooth, it really does not seem to be worth the price premium.  The Se7921 is an excellent epilator that is worthy of 5 stars but the extra price for the Brush attachment brings this down to 4 stars.  Save the money and get the 7181 instead.<br /><br />*** Positive Points: ***<br /><br />- Excellent Epilator that is worthy of 5 stars<br />- The 40 tweezer system and sonic massage really do lead to less painful epilation<br />- Built in light is a great additional<br />- Battery lasts a very long time between charges<br />- True Wet/Dry system<br />- Fast recharge time<br /><br />*** Negative Points: ***<br /><br />- Exfoliation brush is not worth the $20-30 premium over the 7181 model<br />- Epilation truly is more painful than shaving (though some say less than waxing)
B0009VQ8KQ|5|Love this stuff.Been using this for some time.keeps the hair soft and wavy even years after a perm.Keeps frizz in check.Four star for this product!
B00LKSVFI2|5|Very well made.  Two sided mirror with 10X magnification on one side.  Packaged securely and shipped quickly.
B001BAFQOS|5|not a lot of difference but some volume added<br />good lather and cleaning also<br />i would recommend this shampoo to all
B00E4PMQAO|4|Product has a quality feel and appearance. It also works as described. Time will tell.
B000HJUWRU|5|If you don't have some one to scrub your back, say due to a divorce, this tool really helps cleanse the body.  The bristles seem a little bit stiff at first taking it out of the package, but they soften with soap and water, giving a stimulating massage and removing dead skin flakes and other unwanted particle from your back.
B00P2RSND2|4|Great brushes, fast with shipping. Very satisfied and I  would buy from this seller again.
B00MR05DQ2|5|I have melasma, so I have light discoloration splotches all over my face. I tried another product that actually worked well but made my face red and oily for some reason. I'm thinking it is because it had hydroquinone. What I really like about this product is that it doesn't bother my super sensitive skin. There is no drying or peeling at all. I haven't used it for long but am starting to see some fading so that is great. I could spend $5,000 on a procedure at my plastic surgeons to only maybe make my melasma better or a reasonable amount with this product and get real results. I recommend that you give it a try.
B002XQ1YMM|5|Good size
B000RYYI7K|5|I really love this shampoo! I usually use Herbal Essence but lately it has made my head itch and is drying out my hair. I found a great deal on this Dove shampoo on here, so I decided to give it a try. I am really impressed with it. I have long hair down to my waist and it is a bit damaged. This shampoo has made my hair look so much more shiny and not dull like it was. Everyone has been complimenting me on how healthy my hair looks and that was not the case before. I also no longer have an itchy scalp like I did with my previous shampoo. I a now a Dove fan!
B00C7WGE7W|1|This looked like a good, solid pencil.  But you can only use it as long as the tip lasts.  As soon as you try to sharpen it, the tip just keeps breaking off, no matter how LITTLE you sharpen it.  It's MUCH too expensive for it to last such a short time.  Talk about a waste of money!
B00CS5WAIU|5|I am in my 60s and have an olive complexion. I needed something to even and brighten my skin tone and this did it for me.  This product is gentle on your skin. I have very dry and sensitive skin; I have not had a problem with my skin and I have been using it daily for 2 weeks now.  I would recommend this to any woman, young or old, who needs something to brighten their complexion.
B00GGHQ802|5|Great!
B0080E8X7K|5|I just turned 60 and needed something a little more delicate to use on my face. When I first picked it up I thought &#34;Yikes- that'll take my skin off!&#34;, but when it is moistened it is gentle, palm-sized and perfect for my skin. In fact, I use it all over with a cleanser.<br />This is one of the few times I have found something that is too expensive on Amazon. I bought it at my local health food store for $5 each, so check around before purchasing unless you have money to burn.
B000VKZMHK|3|It seems to do the job; however does not seem to shave as close as my old electric (cheaper Remington) shaver.  The 5 o'clock shadow seems to come a little sooner....but again, its doing the job for the most part.  Probably just stick with cheaper shavers in the future.
B000HF4PE0|5|Just got this item- was skeptical but lo and behold it does work well- makes a big difference getting my right sock or stocking on-
B0006ZEW2G|5|Love, love, love this liquid hand soap! The scent is beautiful, but not overwhelming. It takes only a tiny bit of soap to really cleanse your hands. Perhaps it's the tea tree oil in it, but my hands feel super clean and refreshed every time I use it.
B00FB5J8WU|4|I echo all the great reviews. I too have always suffered with dry cracked heels. I used this product once and knew it was better than anything I had ever used. You need to be careful as you can make your heels sore, even though it doesn't hurt while you're scraping, it will hurt after! I now only have to do my heels once a week (previously, I had to do them every day). I have now bought this product for other members of my family and they all think it's great.
B00009RF1E|1|OMG.,, this thing shredded my neck, I had to use an ice pack to reduce the pain and red welts it caused !!
B00017XN7E|5|It's my favorite.
B005OZJYUS|5|I use this brush every for my eye shadow! It blends the colors and gives a more softer, finished look.
B002VLZHLI|1|Gross and did nothing. Do not waist your time. I do not know how people could deal with this or give it a good review.
B00DQ3CJ70|5|Its the best conditioner ever, it works good on my hair, smells great, calming and it de-tangles my hair
B00BFZY348|5|Very good!!
B00FEZ9RQO|5|Perfect replacement head.
B0056GDG90|5|Time ago a got bought here on amazon a keratin smoothing sistem from keratinresearch (great product), and it gave such a great result that i no longer go to the salon, my hair is a mix between straight, wavy and curly and the process of dyeing it has left it frizzy, the keratin treatment left my hair frizz-free, so soft and manageable, well the point is that my hair is so great now that i dont need to go to the salon anymore but i still have to use some hot tool to shape it in my case was the traditional blowdryer and a hair brush which is very complicated and too hot, so i started looking for a hot air brush and found the john freida, i also cheked on conair spin hot air brush but some reviewers said that the spin function is useless if you have long hair and it makes sense,  so I bought the john freida and I have to say im sooooo happy, this is perfect, I just let my hair air dry and use it when my hair is almost completely dry and it works wonderful, the ion technology really works, I was skeptical at first about that ion thing but its true, I noticed the difference between this and my old conventional blowdryer, the hair looks shinier and less frizzy and in less than 10 minutes I'm done!!!! My hair is so shiny, soft with volume, I can give waves to my hair and also get it straight with this, the fact that this is ment to be used when the hair is almost dry is great because the hair is less exposed to heat damage, some people complain that it cant used on wet hair but its supposed to be like that and its so much better, thanks John freida for this product I just wish I had discover this earlier.
B000GLRREU|5|I recently perchased this item based on other reviews. I have had it for 1 mo,I find it well worth the money.Easy to use w/ great results. I would recommend and would definately purchase again.
B001FB5O7M|4|this is only deodorant so it keeps you fresh smelling it does not keep you from sweating.  unscented and feels soft going on.  No sticky or gummy feeling and doesn't clump like one i tried recently.
B00HETXS1I|5|Beautiful colour (very important) perfect size and quality, exactly what I was hoping for.
B007EHWDTS|5|so useful
B00EJDG7XI|5|Smells good without being overbearing which is important with someone who has migraines as I do.  Also since using this men have been flocking around my girl friend and me at dances and our dance cards are full now.  She liked it so well she bought some too.  We are mid aged ladies btw.  Great perfume!!!
B00NE4AQUI|5|A good size and easy to fill.  The frosted glass gives it a good look.
B00CST4AS4|5|I'm allergic to most soaps. This works perfect for me.
B007SASMS2|3|when i ordered this product i thought i was getting it to treat something that it was not intended to treat. the information on line was misleading.i can't really rate it because i couldn't use it.
B001KVTEUA|5|I'm not rating the product because that's not who is selling it .fast shipping .i see price went up after I bought it .great product too for curl definition and twist outs and all those styles
B001A1S08W|2|I purchsaed two bottles of this Surya Henna, followed their directions and none of my gray hair was colored.  This may work for other women but not me!
B001XURHNY|5|Does the job, just what I needed.  This is heavier and thicker metal than expected.<br />My razors and brush fit perfectly
B000GHVIRG|1|Great product, my sister was so very happy with it.    The present is in Costa Rica !!!!!!!!!!!!    Your service was also amazing and prompt.    Thank you very much
B003U8K6M6|4|This is a fairly expensive product, but it comes with some nice features. This shaver gives you lots of options. For example, there are 18 different length settings. Sometimes you can have too many options, and this may be the case. Do you really need 18 different settings?    Still, there's a lot to like. The design is very stylish. The shaver has a distinctive look and is easy to hold. Another nice feature is the lithium ion battery system. Who wants to be burdened with cords?    Probably the best feature is the vacuum system. Instead of making a huge mess the shaver uses the vacuum to dispose of loose hair.    This shaver also has a 2 year warranty if anything goes wrong.    Ultimately, it'd be nice if the vacuum was stronger. It's also be great if the charge held longer. These are minor quibbles, however.
B00HM8UG16|4|I purchased this when I purchased Powerful Emjoi Micro-Pedi Callus Remover, I have not yet tried them as the one that came with my order is still good.
B000PY17PI|1|This tool is the worst!! I have long hair and doesn't matter how I used it tangled my hair so badly that I had to spend 10 mins untangling it hoping my hair won't fall off or need to be cut from it. If you have long hair please don't waste your money on this. I am really disappointed with my money down the drain.
B003F17EFA|1|First off, one of the cans wont even spray.  If it does, its a small amount and you have to keep letting off of it and then pressing down again and you don't get enough to do anything.  Second, it weighs your hair down and then I did not notice that it did anything different for the humidity than my regular hair spray.  Wont order ever again.
B007579G3S|1|Pleasant taste.<br />Did not notice extra whitening and it certainly did not clean as well as my regular toothpaste.<br />Would not purchase again.
B0086VI9TE|4|Nice but not as good as original heads. They seem a bit softer
B000NCYZXI|1|This brush was pictured to have an ergonomic handle but it does not! The handle is all wood and not what I wanted.
B004S89OVQ|4|I have used alot of inexpensive brushes and that is exactly whay I got! This one is great for the money!! I reccomend it.
B00RM4VQSC|5|Nice surprise gift she was very happy  can't write a lot they are home alone tonight.
B0065ZC4XA|4|Has all the basics, just wish the colors were as bright as the picture.  They seem a bit more washed out.  But still a great deal.
B00170JX5U|5|i mean what can i say it shipped on time anyone who knows the product knows what it is and does  it is used to build up the enamel on a horse hoof to become strong and healthy and it is also awsome for human nail restoration
B003EMIX8W|5|Bought this thinking it was deodorant. It's not.<br />It's soap. But it smells good and probably does what they claim.
B0002Z94MI|5|Wonderful, warm, natural-looking blond color, kit lasts a  long time, (although it is only demmi-permanent) it lasts for about 3 months. According to specifications, you should leave it on for 45 minutes when coloring your hair. I found that leaving it on for one hour (or more!) lengthen the time for the color to last. I love it and you will too.
B00069Q3LU|1|So very very disappointed. I agree with other reviewers, my old turbie twist was cotton and absorbed so much better than microfiber. If I had known they were microfiber I wouldn't have purchased. It's too much hassle to send them back (annoying) so I'll keep them and use them for something else. Not sure what, but it won't be wrapping around my wet hair.
B00K4PLC30|5|Arrived in a timely manner.  Works well.  Smooth.  relaxing feel.
B00APRR34Y|5|Great lip gloss with a built in light and mirror.
B001B4Q5X0|5|My face has way less breakouts after I started using this face wash. Face feels really clean too after using it. It makes the skin really smooth.
B001G60HR8|5|LOVE this lipstick hopefully it will be available for a<br />long time. Great color. Goes on really nice. Nice and smooth.
B003PP0CPU|1|It's a scam. You will get charge hundred of dollars once you give your credit card info to these people.
B00EA2GZRG|4|Good product
B0039OZ2GQ|2|It does smell like sulfur, it leaves your skin smelling clean, but squeaky and rubber type of clean! It didn't help my eczema as I thought it would.
B009GIOVKW|5|my face is so well-cleansed. so easy to maneuver. kindof hard to insert batteries, but very nice product. absolutely love it. It is really a nice spa moment for me whenever i cleanse. Cleansing is no longer an onus, but a sensuous pleasure.
B006M87AZC|1|I ordered these in December...I'm still waiting on them, so now I've just asked for a refund but we'll see if I get them. I really should have looked at the reviews when I first saw these, cheaper is not always better.
B000C1ZB3I|5|A WONDERFUL SCENT!  I PURCHASE THIS EVERY YEAR FOR SPECIAL PEOPLE.  MICHAEL EAST
B007S9JMXC|5|Wow! How beautiful and long lasting this stain is. It is fantastic and for the Summer it is the best.
B00MFI71WU|5|This has a surprisingly light scent of coconut, not overpowering at all like some scented lotions. It is so great for spraying the back and hard to reach places. I am so sorry I didn't buy sooner!
B00538TSMU|5|I surprising liked the more dramatic looking lashes over the natural looking lashes. The dramatic looking lashes looks intimidating at first with it's thick band, however it does make the lashes look more full and shorter than the other more natural looking ones. However it may just be me because I have black hair, and if you have any lighter color hair the lashes may look more notiable. They are quite reusable, and stackable for any eye look you are trying to retrieve.
B0051PLBG6|3|This moisturizer certainly is &#34;moisturizing&#34;.. though it's pretty sticky and leaves heavy residue on skin. I like to use it on my legs when I'm out in the sunshine. My bottle may have been a little off-cause the consistency was weird-there was a separation of oil and lotion. It rubbed in just fine though and I was pleased overall with it. Again, it's quite oily.. doesn't soak/sink in like a regular lotion. I appreciate how clean/natural non-harmful the product is though!
B0082B41FO|5|I'll was a little leery of these after reading literally every review of these. But I got these today and they far surpassed my expectations!! I made sure to measure my teeth before ordering (I kinda resent the horse teeth reviews I've seen, my natural teeth are large but I was always complimented on them, until the impact from my wisdom teeth caused one to crack and break). Take your time when molding, literally roll the mold in plastic to the size of a spaghetti noodle. Make sure when you're finished, to detail the teeth but cutting the excess plastic from around each tooth. I used a straight razor. When I finished I immediately asked my mom how my teeth looked, she didn't even know they weren't mine. She thought I just finished a whitening treatment. I also texted pics to two more people just to make sure. No on knew they weren't mine. I only wish there could a little space between the front teeth for an even more realistic effect. My implant process will take about four months. I will definitely continue purchasing these as needed until that's complete. A small price to pay to have my confidence back! I've never written a review this long
B00A3C3N5O|1|Doesn't work...doesn't transfer at all!
B001HTCYPC|5|i just started using this when i got it a couple days ago and my zits are already starting to clear up and my face feel s very soft. i love it so much. its a must get! make sure to get 2 of these cause you will run out quickly!
B00W63VO7W|5|I got this product for my Aunt... She loves it.... And will buy more! Thank you very much
B00G0O3ALG|5|My wife and I seen this on how it made and it is just the way it looks smells good to
B0017JV7QY|2|I remember smelling this in an ad and loving it but never got around to buying it because it is so expensive.  So I decided to try it.  I don't love it.  I like it much better after a couple of hours when it seems to not be as flowery and even then the scent doesn't last very long.  I will not be buying Michael Kors again.  I would recommend going to a department store and spraying some on you and wearing it for a day or two before spending the money to own it.  I was pretty disappointed.  I did receive it quickly so that was nice.
B0053L2E1O|5|This is great soap for sensitive skin. It clears up acne and bacterial skin infections when used in conjunction with essential oils such as lavender, frankincense,tea tree.
B00OQUY4OS|5|Very classy design, and durable as well as beautiful!
B004TSFBJO|1|When Real Techniques came out a few years ago, I bought many of the brushes and brush sets. The blush brush was one of my favorites. I thought the price point was a great, as was the quality. I wash my brushes regularly with baby shampoo. The brush came unattached from the handle. Had to throw away.
B0064FG3YC|5|I have been using this product as needed for years. it is the best Cold Sore Relief ever. Love this product, gave some to my family members.
B006U9D6D8|5|As a beginner just now getting into makeup I didn't know what types of brushes I would need. I researched and saw what I needed, but when going out to buy the good quality brushes I found that most were expensive. This is easy and cheap. I love it and I'm sure anybody else would love it as well.
B001SGSB9M|5|big blue
B000A7I8B6|4|I love a good bar of soap in the shower.  Grandpa's Patchouli soap delivers on one level and disappoints on another.  For lather and scent, it gets five stars.  Unfortunately one round of use demonstrates how far one bar will go, and that's not very far.  Made up mostly of coconut and palm oil, with aloe vera gel almost at the bottom of the list (beat out only by essence of patchouli), even short showers and conservative use will eat it up pretty quickly.  Great soap as far as it goes, but I'd prefer a bigger bar or, more to the point, a recipe that doesn't dissolve quite so easily.
B00IIVOCFC|4|This is a great set for anyone who likes to use a variety of lipstick shades and try out new colors without the price of a single lipstick. The variety of shades is very good - everything from bright and deep reds to pale pinks and corals, and everything in between. There's even some unique colors such as a shimmery golden tone. Each lipstick tube is full sized, however the lipstick inside is about half the size. I didn't see this as a problem since there's so many in the set (so for the price it's fine) and honestly, I can't remember the last time I used up a lipstick all the way to the end. So no complaints about the size (just be aware that they're half sized sticks).<br /><br />Each lipstick tube is clear in the middle so that the actual lipstick shows through. I wish ALL lipstick tubes were made this way so that the  shade color is clear visible and it's the actual lipstick instead of a color sticker at the end of a tube. This makes it so easy to pick out the color, which is nice because there's so many in this set.<br /><br />The lipstick itself is very good quality, which for the price I was happily surprised. These lipsticks go on very smooth and creamy with a matte finish. Good staying power too.<br /><br />Packaging: The lipsticks are packaged in six small lightweight cardboard boxes that are wrapped together with plastic packaging wrap.<br />Once opened up you'll need something to keep these in - the photo might give the impression that these come with some sort of display stand, which the set does not. I put mine in a square make up case with a flip top lid and that's been the perfect way to store them, especially because the clear center on the tubes makes finding the desired shade pretty fast and easy to do.<br /><br />Two of the lipsticks were separated from the base of the tube and slightly stuck up in the cap. After tapping the tube slightly the lipstick fell down into the base of the tube and stayed put. All the other lipsticks were in perfect condition and in place in the tubes.<br /><br />Overall a great set for anyone wanting a big variety of lipstick shades to choose from and wants a quality matte lipstick too.<br />Definitely recommend.ition and in place in the tubes.<br /><br />Overall a great set for anyone wanting a big variety of lipstick shades to choose from and wants a quality matte lipstick too.<br />Definitely recommend.
B007OX0RBS|3|A couple of the eyeshadows were broken and are almost unusable. I was a little disappointed but everything else was okay.
B00PYK2UI6|4|Love the brushes, especially the big one for the shower. But I dislike that it takes 4 AA batteries. Wish I knew that before I purchased it. Would recommend getting rechargeable batteries for it.
B0019DMB22|5|I started using this after I had been using other Nioxin products for a while.  It gives my hair a boost without being heavy.  I've noticed a difference in it and other volumizers.  It's hard to find where I live, so when I found it at Amazon, I was delighted to order and not have to search in nearby towns for it.
B003VCJA3C|5|Love the scent.
B00AFP6LOO|5|Good product. I add this to my skin cream, & smooths & hydrates my skin. OK price & it came early. I'd buy it again.
B006OHM542|5|Works well for windy or rainy days to keep hair in place
B001EWF2LU|5|I noticed the difference after the first use.  I even emailed my sister about it because she's got the same kind of hair (thin & fine).  It has a nice smell. I also like that Amazon sells it as a two-pack.  I would recommend this shampoo to anyone with thin hair.  Oh, and if you've got short hair (I do) you only need to use a smidgen.
B000VTLQRQ|1|This iron broke in 1 2/2 week of receiving it. I bought the Sedu and it is out of this world. The sedu is the best iron I've ever had!
B00006IV30|2|I've been using this brand/size of curlers for about 10 years now.  Normally, with 6-day-a-week use, it will last about 1 year.  I always keep one in reserve and this current one that I ordered is in my closet as reserve.  However, I will need to take out to use soon, because after only 6 months of 2-3-day-a-week use, the current rollers (same brand/product) that I've been using no longer heats up.  Bummer, because this is the PERFECT amount of curlers to quickly throw my hair into for the perfect size curl, but it looks like I am going to find a new brand soon to have in reserve.
B003AKHQG8|5|great product works very well with thermal spray. gives hair nice deep waves that last all day. great for a different look..
B009TLPABU|1|This cream did not work for me at all. I applied it on my navel as directed before getting it pierced & it did not numb my navel at all. I felt everything. I was even able to feel when I pinched my navel myself when I was testing it before the procedure.  I applied the whole tube of cream and it did nothing.
B001UGMZIS|5|Pepsodent is hard to find these days but WELL worth the effort. It has the best flavor of all the toothpastes out there and if you've never tried it before or merely don't like pastes and prefer gels, etc...prepare to switch brands...oh- and get ready to pay a lot less than you are now for all the other pastes and gels out there...a nice bonus! And for us oldsters: YOU'LL WONDER WHERE THE YELLOW WENT WHEN YOU BRUSH YOUR TEETH WITH PEPSODENT!...look that one up on video from the 50s. PS- Buy it!
B004G56OHS|4|The stone comes with a coarse side and a fine side; but the stone looks man-made as opposed to natural pumice.  The fine side is very nice for use on hand callouses and the coarse side will be better for feet.  The stone fits into the palm of the hand (I wear size 7 rings as an example) and is planed flat on 4 sides.  Don't expect a curved profile on this one (which is not a bad thing).
B00GSINA14|5|I got 3 of this last Christmas to give to my lady supervisors and they were very happy with my gift. It has a nice assortment of products inside and I wish I got one for me too! I so love Clinique. The bag too looks so nice and heavy-duty.
B00Q78LZXA|1|I hated it! It did not work for my hair. I tried it wet and dry and it did not curl my hair at ALL! My hair wet turns into a curly fro but the front part of my hair stays wavy, which is why I bought the Magic Twist. It matted my hair down and it didn't curl or add any texture. I would not recommend this product to anyone with longer hair.
B001QFKQ1G|2|Didn't work as i thought it would.
B00021W26M|5|Little to dark
B000F4GIN4|5|I have long thick hair that tends to be coarse because I flat iron it.  I definitely notice a difference using this conditioner (I use the shampoo too).  My hair feels softer and looks shiny and healthy.
B00GGPKJBS|5|I love eye shadows, thats the main reason I bought this. price was right! It folds up nicely and I keep it right on top of my jewelery box! Great buy!
B003RR4A2M|5|I have had my Croc for about a year and a half now. I absolutely LOVE it! I have fine naturally curly hair and this flat iron produces shiny, straight hair with one pass through. I like the digital temperature display and automatic shutoff feature as well. Truly a great product worth every penny.
B00C5I1KVI|5|I was very skeptical about ordering hair online because I had read so many bad reviews about people getting a bad product.  Some reviews from other companies stated that the hair was not the same as the photo posted or the net being the wrong color and the hair tangled and shedding.<br /><br />WELL I must say that this wig is better than the really expensive ones I tried on at the beauty supply store.  This hair is exactly the same as the picture. Very full, silky, shiny and long...definitely Remi Indian hair!  No tangles!  I have only had it for 1HOUR so we will see after a couple of weeks.  It sheds a little in the back, but some shedding can be expected. The baby hair in the front also make it look very natural, like my own hair line.  The net matches my skin tone exactly (I am med. brown skin, African American). Shipping was fast and I will definitely order from them again!  They even sent me a free gift of a lovely Marc Jacobs perfume.  This hair is perfect for my summer vacation hair-do!
B0032H2FWO|4|The polish came brand new as promised. I've been looking for a color that could apply for all year round and this was it. The color isn't as blue as the photo,but a nice shade of maybe teal. However, it is a gorgeous color and is opaque after two thin applications.
B0006NYCT6|5|It smells wonderful, looks wonderful, softens skin, great bubbling foam cleansing, doesn't leave film in bath tub, I really like it
B004H3QCPS|5|I purchased this for numerous old acne scars on my chin.  I have been using it faithfully, daily for 2 months now and it has diminished the appearance slightly.  I wasn't expecting a miracle but it has softened them up and when I put my makeup on, the surface of my skin is smoother so my makeup looks better.  It has helped with the redness also.  I would defintitely recommend this product.
B00GSTBWYA|5|Good product would buy again.
B0052GADTK|5|always get them
B007T8589E|5|I absolutely love this dye. It smells so good! Like a blueberry smoothie. Compared to other US boxed dyes, this one doesn't burn my eyes with the chemical smells and my hair is so soft after! I leave it on for as long as American hair dyes, 30 min. And the color is so beautiful. I lie the comb style applicator as well, if you have very think or very long hair buy 2 boxes for a whole head application but for root touch ups one box is fine.<br />I highly recommend this for box dye users!<br />I love it!
B000UUQAY0|3|Excellent product
B000052ZB4|1|I use Neutrogena and DHC products exclusively, with no problems.<br />I needed a cleanser, and tried this product. After using, I felt a tingling sensation, sort of burning and itchy... and my skin got red, bumpy and blotchy. It took about a week before I connected the dots, and realized this was the only new product I had used on my face. I guessed allergic reaction, and thankfully it has begun to clear up after two full days of not using it.<br />I was seriously considering a visit to my dermatologist...it was that bad!<br />This is the only Neutrogena product that has ever affected my skin in such a negative way.
B002CSPKSU|5|Awesome product! Doesn't make my skin oily and I can't wait to see more results!
B00MXDMH8A|5|Love them
B00062ADKO|5|I am amazed at how this powder made a huge difference in my makeup routine. Even my husband noticed how light the make up looks on me. When using other pressed powders, my face looks cakey, but this powder just made my face seem flawless with a perfect finish. Its lighter on the face than any other product I have used. Altogether, I would suggest people to buy this product. I am in love with it &lt;3
B00ENA289O|4|Nice!
B00968IUGI|1|It was not the right size for my dispenser. Apparently there has been a change in the unit size and refills for mine are no longer available
B00028N2UU|5|I found this cream recently during a visit to a local pharmacy in Switzerland and have liked it more than fancier ones that I have bought recently by far. It is creamy, absorbed well into the skin and has a very mild flowery scent that is very pleasant. It is targeted at young kids with acne and oil imbalances but also for adults that are dealing with occasional breakouts (me). I was desperately trying to find something to moisturize my sensitive skin, which is a recent development, and my dermatologist recommended something that was light and without chemicals. So the pharmacist recommended this. I use a night treatment cream for dark spots, with retinol, so finding the right cream proved to be hard. My skin became red with everything except this non-assuming cream that leaves your skin feeling baby soft. Not only that but it deals perfectly with my oily combination skin. The price tag is perfect, after spending so much in creams that I ended up not being able to use, it's a relief. This cream doesn't offer anything but good clean hydration for sensitive skin and has natural ingredients. I looked into it after I tried it and found that their parent company is the same as the pricier Anne Marie Borlind products which are known worldwide for their great natural products (although those are very expensive). I don't know if the formulation in the USA is the same as in Switzerland since companies change products depending on countries but as far as I'm concerned this is a keeper. (I also bought the toner and cleanser and love them as much)
B0046VGPHQ|5|This is my favorite way to get some colour, I have wry fair skin and use this year round. I had an issue with shipping but it was handled so fast and with such good customer service, it ended up being with the carrier and not the company who I bought it from! Thank you so much, 100% Will be purchased again!
B001UTG1U8|3|I have used other Jergens fair to medium tanning products and was pleased. I thought I would try this latest formula. However, this one is still a little too dark for me. I am VERY fair and this one didn't apply as evenly and left me looking to fake. Went back to my original formula. I suggest this formula for someone more medium than fair.
B00K5MP8RS|5|These are adorable. Fit my baby girl perfectly! Very well made for the price and the color selection is excellent.
B00FFKP3I4|3|I have no complaints about the product itself, it has a pronounced herbal pepperminty aroma and is slightly on the more viscous side of the scale.<br /><br />The reason I only give it 3 stars is that the cap design is very poor, and in spite of that it is still $10 more than other very similar products. The cap is very thin aluminum and it leaks, so it is not good to travel with. There is also not a dropper on the cap, which you get with many other equivalent brands that cost less.<br /><br />Unless they switch up their caps and drop the price, I will be not be ordering this again.
B002BG2T4Q|5|this was the best kit that i have bought to date, price was great and instructions were good, my hair is dark brown and it stripped it to white, i am happy.
B00DGGA898|4|It's really light and feels real. easy to brush and everything BUT the hairline is pretty bad. there really isn't a good way to part it without it looking weird. If you have similar colored hair, you could let down the front of your hair and pin it back over the wig to make it seem more realistic but other than that i do really love this wig :) i would recommend it.
B001ESA2YG|3|This definitely does detangle my daughter's hair, but it's impossible to wash out leaving her hair slightly slimy feeling and dirty looking.  I guess I'll keep looking for a good detangling conditioner.
B0009PVV4K|5|Works awesome
B008GOR6O0|5|This is just want I needed for my darks rings under my eyes and my shine on my nose and forehead. Thank you!
B00AY90J1C|5|This dries surprisingly fast.  I have curly/wavy hair- this dryer styles well at great speed!  I had read some of the reviews of people saying it was heavy-I would say it is slightly heavier than some other blow dryers, but I would not have noticed it without having read the reviews.  If someone had limited strength in their arms or pain for some reason, then perhaps a lighter blow dryer would be best.  Otherwise, I highly recommend.
B00GJYMRUC|5|Very good! I have been using this product daily for over 2 weeks and it has done amazing things. I HAD combination skin that would get so incredibly oily yet I would have dry spots.. until I found this product. Now I'm not constantly worried about my face being oily, it use to be a huge insecurity but I don't even think about it anymore.<br /><br />Also I had some redness around my nose and that has improved greatly. That has nearly all gone away too. It leaves my face incredibly soft and my skin looks even in tone and texture. I'm truly shocked by what 2 weeks has done for me. I'm am a lifetime user.Great Product!
B006M8DDM6|3|It is recommended for hatches do not work very long
B004NCFOZM|5|So amazing! skin feels so good!
B0002Z8PLE|5|This color combined with the l'oreal Hicolor Hilights in red gave me the perfect shade of red. I love this.
B000GCUPOS|5|This is by far the best product I've found for my long thin blonde hair.   It gives a lot of strength and body for styling.
B003CTTZQQ|5|I kept hearing people rave about this product but was hesitant to try it since the regular castor oil made my hair dryer than before. However, I finally decided to give it a try after a friend of mine recommended it. I had see the difference in her hair and decided to give it a try. From the first day of using this product, I have had a steady decrease in scalp and hair dryness. I love this stuff!
B00WEJPARI|4|They're really great. Soft and and their is a lot of variety.
B003ZW7L70|5|This is my favorite straightener and detangler. For around $20 it's a good deal because I know it's not cheap but it lasts me about half a year! Although I do have shoulder length hair.  I def notice a difference when I don't use this when styling with heat - hair feels more brittle and frizzes more without it.  Even when I'm air drying my hair to get waves and curls, I'll wait to spritz this until my hair is almost all the way dry, then spritz my hair lightly all over and it will curl/wave in just the right way (this is also something that happens when my hair gets rained on, but with the Sojourn it's less frizzy)
B001V9SXXU|2|The cream itself is a nice thick cream, but it is hard to spread and does leave the skin feeling a bit sticky after. The main reason I didn't like it was the smell. To me, I think it had a faint formaldehyde smell. I couldn't get past it and stopped using it after the third try.
B00A9JLCJA|4|A great buy for someone who hasn't used Clinique products before and wants to try out a few things. I especially recommend the Youth Surge cream. It really brightens your skin and makes it much softer and younger-looking. These samples are very small, though.
B00CVDTMI0|3|Nice selection of colors with no duplicates. Almost every shade of brown on the planet. However, it's impossible to sharpen these without losing a lot of liner. Wish there was a dark red included.
B005F1ISOO|3|bought for thinning hair. product works pretty good my hair still falls out a lot but have noticed a little difference
B00LMWMQV6|5|These flower clips are top-notch!  Quality, durable product.  I am impressed at how well they stay in my young daughter's fine hair.  They help her feel confident and beautiful, and I love that purchasing these helps support families in need.  The colors are really fun, as well.  Different and more vibrant than the box-store, machine-made products.  Support handmade!
B000C1Z67O|5|I bought this for my mother because she could not find it in any local stores. It's the same light, great-smelling powder she used in the 80's. It was reasonably priced and shipped fast.
B001P752XM|1|payed too much for this and it does not moisturize my lips, i would have to re apply every 10 minutes totally not worth it!
B00W2EH98I|5|Amazing
B00A3LVMMQ|5|Product is wonderful.  It is sturdy and looks very good in my bathroom.  I would highly recommend this product.
B00641UCY8|5|my new must have. my routine wash partner. leaves your hair soft and manageable and smells great.
B002946Q4E|5|I have thick eyebrows but I use this to fill in and define the parts that look \\"thinner.\\" The brow wax lasts all day. I don't like how the highlighter looks on my brow bone but I'm sure it would work great on the inner corner of my eye to give a more \\"awake\\" look.
B00UHS7CGU|5|I absolutely loved this product! I don't believe it has an alcohol, so didn't dry my skin. The smell is fantastic. I felt that it clarified and cleared my skin. I will definitely buy again exclamation exclamation
B0054GBXOW|4|i  have bought  more of them after i used one up.  but  i  spent more money this  time. thats the reason why i gave it  four stars. the price goes up  so quickly. from 9.99 to  14.99 in such a short time. i am afraid it will keep on  going up. now i  am  looking for another brand  instead of it .feel disappointed.
B0009OAHC8|4|Great product. Arrived late after Christmas unfortunately, therefore my reason for only four stars.
B00D1329BG|3|I have used the nono 8800 for a couple of years before it pooped out.  Now I got the nono pro3 on hsn.  What I don't like:  The plastic that runs along your face to help keep it upright has a lot of drag.  It has been replaced with some cheap plastic.  I am not too happy about that.  If you compare to the nono 8800- run your finger along the plastic or as in the direction your face would, the 8800 is smooth, no drag.  The pro 3 is like taking a cheap disposable razor on your face.  It burns away the hair as well or even better, but that plastic is irritating.  I am not happy.
B0002KHTG6|5|Working very nicely.I still have one new unused one left.  They definitely manage to polish a shine into your smile.
B000HGFEIK|4|Smells great. Loved this soap. Not too moisturizing but scent makes up for it.
B000P7BB3S|4|Very fun and shiny
B000V5Z4J6|4|First, the good. It's not overly complicated to use. Simply put your brush head inside, close it, and hit the button on top. After about 10 minutes, your brush head is sanitized. It doesn't take up a lot of space on your bathroom counter, and doesn't look unnecessarily space-age or weird to draw attention to it. It basically sits in the background and does its job.<br /><br />Now the bad. While product pictures--even those on the box itself--show the brush heads inside, there are none included with the product. However, there are several adapters included which allow it to fit various newer Sonicare toothbrushes. Those using standard brushes or even competing brands will not find something they can use here.<br /><br />I recommend it if you have the right brushes. If not, I wouldn't buy the toothbrushes needed to make this work.
B0040IM54W|3|This product works well and lathers up nice, but the scent wasn't pleasant for me and I wouldn't buy it again.  I was hoping for a vanilla scent, but if there is any in there I can't detect it.
B00GMP40VW|4|great product
B000E3DX5M|4|This product works for me.  More effective than standard toothpaste w/o the miserable sweeteners that are typically added.  Try one of the smaller sizes to see if you like it.
B00821PV9E|5|Great buy.
B007FIU7QM|5|Perfect brush for concealer. It gets into all tje smaller spots and is durable. I use it everyday. Shipping was fast too.
B003EGYDI2|5|I've used this product for years and love it.
B00IEC9VT2|5|Love this line especially the shampoo!  They smell so good after their bath!
B001ET78BU|4|Was excited to try it based on review and completely satisfied.  I would purchase again if on sale.
B00FZNMHZS|5|good mint waxed dental floss
B00N001PJW|5|A great deal, I may never buy these in the store again! Thanks.
B00D8ZOVMW|5|Definitely worth the price and seems to be great. Can run 10+ hours when full.
B00GY3ZOMG|5|These brushes are so great!! The bristles are super soft and the brushes themselves are super dense. I was really surprised because for the pice I thought they were going to be not the best quality. I love them more than some of my name brand brushes. It's a must have!!!
B0006V5M6U|5|I use this whenever I am relaxing in the bath.  It makes my feet silky smooth, and I like that you card use the product on wet skin.  This works better than any other pumice stone I've owned.
B007JD3RVU|4|I love this product! I bought this product as a substitute/alternative for the MAC Mineralize Skinfinish Naturals, and it's just as great. however, I didn't give it 5 stars because if you apply a little bit too much it can be too shimmery for my taste. But when you apply just the right amount, it gives a great glow.
B00PIL8MA6|3|It's not quite like like Elsa's, as my 3 1/2 quickly pointed out upon its arrival, she was a little disapointed but for the price... The styles off and the color is yellowish but it's still cute. The wig cap does run a little small as well, it's very snug on my kiddo
B00GS7OKHS|2|The results after using 'Visio Elan' for several weeks was no better than &#34;Anew products (Genics-Treatment Concentrate/Pro Line Eraser/Eye Treatments/Moisturizers/Day Force lifting, etc.) by AVON.  Plus, &#34;Anew&#34; products by AVON are far less expensive!<br /><br />UNLIKE &#34;Visio Elan&#34;!
B003U56EZW|5|Great smell with a nice textured on - the - go bottle . Has a fancy name and I love it .
B005FAPIKM|4|Love the smell of this shampoo and conditioner.  My hair feels and smells amazing after I use it.  My only complaint is that this says it comes with pumps and it didn't have any :(
B005XQ8CXI|3|kids using it - they love it. Takes much less time to use than ordinary hair styling tool. very fast.
B009NOF9Q4|5|I tried this product and love the way it makes my hair feel.  My hair looks very natural and stays well for 2 to 3 days.  Just ordered another tube of it..
B00O4BU0RE|5|The best!
B0009OAHEQ|5|I love Joop!  Been wearing it for years and always get compliments
B001OMI9C4|3|Irritates my skin like crazy and made my kids swell so people thought I'd been crying all day. Ha! Not exactly a good thing. But I have very sensitive skin. I think I'll have to just use a moisturizer instead.
B00CF1NEG4|2|These are not as nice as what I usually receive. They are very stiff and the edges picked up after only a few hours of wear.
B001KYU78U|2|This isn't high enough volume to get the results advertised. I've light brown hair, and it says medium brown. I left it in for the maximum time recommmended and it turned a vomit-coloured orange.
B00166M14A|5|This product was recommended by my esthetician and I bought it the first time at the salon before I found it for much less on Amazon.
B00FYJOQG6|5|This is a really cute present to give and a great stocking stuffer.  It also comes in really handy to have around when a man's out and about (or a woman with short hair) and need to straighten her hair.
B00GT0J7UE|5|I love this mascara, no clumps, not a stringy mess like other brands I have tried. This size is also convenient, a great product to travel with or to stick down in your purse for a quick touch up on the go!
B0009OAGPG|5|pleasent,not overwehlming. hope it does not go to quickly
B001MA0QY2|5|I've had a hair iron I avoid using. It was tedious, took forever, and the curls would come right back on the same day. Decided to try a different iron and bought this a few weeks ago. I LOVE the HSI Professional Hair Iron! It's quick to use and my hair holds it's style much longer. I have 3C curl type hair, so it's pretty stubborn about going straight. With this iron I can use a lower heat setting and still have beautiful hair. WARNING: The sample hair oil is totally addictive. After I finished mine I ordered a bottle and love this stuff better the CHI oil.
B004Z209HS|4|I've only just started using this, but I really like it.  Until now, I've been using shea butter or coconut oil in my hair and both have been leaving it greasy.  I used this after a shower last night and my hair looks fantastic this morning.  Super excited for how my hair will look in a few weeks.
B00157RZ14|5|Best eye serum I ever used
B004IMALXM|4|It is a good product because it adds height and much better comfort for my flat shoes. Some nice shoes are too flat and this gives the foot a good protection against the ground when walking, making it easier to walk longer distances.
B007THNPBS|2|I got tired of having plain old baths, so I wanted to add something new to it so I tried this. I'm highly disappointed in the quality of this product. I put close to half the bottle in the water and barely any foam was made. I will not be buying this product again, I will just use what I got then get something else.
B00B44JUHK|4|very classy
B005C1C02S|4|It was fine and happy with the sparkles. It was part of a package and the price was right, ok.
B003ZS6OJK|5|I ordered these late Saturday night and they arrived at my home the following Wednesday. They are exactly what you buy at CVS or Walgreens, for a much better price. The #120's give my short lashes length and volume, without looking over-the-top. I have started wearing these everyday.
B00CWZ0BLE|5|Really great product not too big and not to small just the right size to not take up too much room.
B00L2JGSLS|3|As Expected
B000H3EPY2|4|best for toenails
B005TTZF4S|5|THIS IS MY FAVORITE COLOR. I WEAR  CND GEL POLISH CONSISTENTLY. THIS POLISH WEARS (FOR ME) FOR THREE WEEKS. I LOVE IT.
B005KUGUBS|5|Good for older skin and doesn't dry out.  Also hypoallergenic
B004M1BO3U|5|Great quality!
B00QRQGQBS|4|i really like it, but you might want to use a plastic card instead of this scraper, because it scratched my plate.......
B00176GSEI|5|This has always been my favorite curling iron. I use it regularly and it doesn't fry my hair. I tried a different brand and had to come back to Hot tools.
B006RFZ66K|5|work well
B000C21CO4|5|great price for amazing perfume!
B005UL1B34|4|Not as bright on skin as I thought it would be. Got eyeshadow at dollar tree that was wayyy brighter. But still was nice and worth it.
B001RPL902|5|I love this spring thing. Whenever my girl-stache starts to grow back, I just take it out, and within minutes it is gone, unlike tweezing which takes FOREVER! It hurst a little bit at first, but you get used to it because it goes so fast you don't even notice it!
B009MCRPLE|5|I have been using Creating Harmony Skin Serum for many years.<br />I met up with a friend who owns a spa and decided to head on over for a<br />facial.  She said, how do you keep your skin so soft and pliable at your<br />age?<br />I shared my SERUM secret with her.  She was amazed.  Ok, no beauty queen<br />here but it made me feel good.  Will need more soon.<br /><br />Thanks, Kathy!<br /><br />Maria
B00GXBEV0A|5|I have terribly dry, frizzy and broken hair! After just one use i was able to feel AND see a difference. It smells great too, i have used products that leave my hair smelling terrible and there is nothing worse! Its a big bottle and will last a long time for me. I am excited to FINALLY getting my hair back to a healthy state.
B004MAXGS2|1|We usually get this lotion from a small Irish store in northern Wisconsin but decided to buy online as it was quite a bit cheaper.  We know why it was cheaper.  The fragrance was barely there in the one bought online.  Do yourself a favor and buy at a small retail store and keep them in business instead of buying a low quality product online.
B005DZNQ6C|5|Love Emu Oil products.
B005P0N29G|5|Best soap for dry skin. Keeps the moisture in.
B003A8CM64|4|I really love that this product lasts ALL day. I also like that the red it bright but not clownish. The only problem I have is that when it dries, it gives me a dividing line on my lip from where my lips part. I guess the moisture towards the inner part of my lip doesn't allow it to stick. As many times as I tried, it does that same line. It's not my favorite lipstick, but I still wear it.
B009GA5XVG|5|I am so glad I tried this. I have purchased it twice now and love it. Excellent product and very thorough for nose waxing if used correctly. They really should provide more applicators though.
B006MA07Q4|5|These are a great addition to my nail art collection.  I can not wait to use these with some of my designs. Excellent price and fast delivery. Would recommend to everyone.
B001ER8RB2|1|Don't buy anything from the Miracle Kit company.  They are dishonest in the extreme.  I got hit with 2 $97+ charges.  I returned the second, un-asked-for kit and was assured the charge would be removed, minus the $15 restocking charge and the return shipping fee.  We'll see.  I told them I liked the product, which I did, but do not do business with companies that engage in sharp practices.  When I use up my current supply, I will be looking for something else more reasonably priced and more honestly offered to take its place.  I like the sharp tingly feel of the masque and the fresh feel and heightened color of my skin after I used it.
B005NBSCSI|5|I bought this candle last year for the holidays.  I loved it so much I just purchased 2 more!  I tried to buy an additional candle after the holidays last year but its only available during the holidays. That's why I'm buying 2 now.  It is pricey, as the previous reviewer mentioned but it is worth it!  It not only makes your home smell wonderful it looks wonderful when lit on my fireplace mantle!
B00APNW6M2|5|Great price!
B000ZU7YWW|5|I was looking for these combs all over and when they said a variety of colors, I received a variety of colors.
B000C1VSLM|5|My wife loves it when I buy Sung for her.  Makes life good all the way round.
B007Q0VI76|5|This is a great Christmas soap. It has a wonderful scent. It cleans and rinses off completely. I would definitely recommend this as a Christmas gift.
B001429U3Q|5|I bought this to wash my Diva Cup and it's a great cleaner. It's such a big bottle for the tiny amount you actually use each cycle so it lasts you a long time!
B004WOSOA8|5|I didn't feel a thing!!!! Your tattoo artist must tattoo u first to open your pores. But after you are half way through you can use the spray and feel nothing!!! Literally nothing!!!
B001ET7HJI|4|This mask is not scented with lavender or anything else.  It is however, fairly comfortable, warm without being too warm, excellent at light blocking, and not hideous or kinky looking.
B000FFI228|1|If u have curly hair (which I do)  this blower was impossible to get my hair straight.  It looks very easy on the commercial when in fact it just frizzed up my hair and left it wild.  I donot reccommend this product at all!!!!!
B004W2OQW0|2|\\"I can use that for my Barbie's\\" is what my child said. I read that it was small, but small doesn't begin to describe this. It is literally the size of a marker. Not just the length, the entire size.
B0067F28ZW|2|Cheap
B000P230OQ|5|Great
B0058L24O6|5|Ive been using fake eye lashes for a while now and these work amazing and look real ! The only thing i would recommend is buying extra glue for them.
B001E767DW|5|I've used Shikai shampoo for quite awhile now and I really like it.  I feel good not using all those \\"bad\\" ingredients and my hair always feels and looks nice.  I have very long hair and I think this shampoo is the best.
B0019LV2QU|5|Great high concentration vitamin E oil that is not too viscous. I will buy again!
B00IASX4BG|5|Nice combination of handmade soaps for dry/sensitive skin.  Bought this as a gift for a friend.  She was very happy and told me that she no longer needs to use medication for the itch.
B004QHDJNI|5|Great for grooming, touch ups or shaving your head.  Doesn't really have enough power for full hair cuts though.  Battery has enough juice to last all week on the road.
B00CH3OT4G|4|This product left My hair feeling silky and sleek without a'build-up' feel. I wouldn't have tried this for the price but I lucked out and found it for 2bucks at my local dollar store. Now, that I know it works for me I wouldn't mind the 6 bucks as much. Smells good...maybe a tad too sweet for my preference, but good. 5 stars for a smaller price tag and a calmer sweetness. Note: my hair is on the thicker side of thin, long, light brown and straight/slight wave.
B0095ZM3HE|1|It doesn't smell good!!
B003QUONE0|5|This is a great product very pigmented, great quality and such lovely neutral colours for such a affordable price. It came earlier than expected. It was meant to come on the 14th but came on the 5th of June just in time give to my friend for her birthday!
B0050QJHTO|3|We did not open this package because my daughter had already received a similar  wand prior to opening this gift and there was no need to have two.
B004TSFE28|5|I you are new to makeup brushes and are looking for a good set to get you started for eye makeup, this is the kit for you! You get everything you need to do eye makeup.  The bristles on all of the brushes are soft and dense, so you can easily apply and blend out shadow without much effort.  The handles make these brushes easy to store and grip.  It's a great set!
B0014B2QTM|5|I ordered 2 of these. Love it. I plan to order some for my friends to try.
B000W30P46|5|Tried all over to find a brush like this. So happy to have found it on Amazon. The price was amazing. Super Satisfied!
B00F4TXSAG|4|Smells  great but I can not smell this on me after 3-4 hours. Lots of compliments. It's cheap enough where you can have an extra bottle at work for touch ups. . Creed is superior to a refined nose. In greasiness in pure smell well blended and good quality.
B005GMYPX0|5|Question asked, How long does it last and the option I selected was It needs to be reapplied occasionally but I only select that option because the actual option was not available.  I only have to reapply once and that's after lunch in my 8 hour work day.
B00JQJHMP2|5|Just as described
B005RRA4B6|5|Nice
B007CMS5C4|4|I really like this soap because it smells good...<br />but the effects are kind of..eh. I'm a male, age 17 and have been u ssing this soap for about 2-3 weeks. i did notice a slight change in skin color, but it was only if i used it that day. So I guess it's a temporary lightener... i dont really use
B00FOAPENE|4|I bought this for my daughter, but of course, I had to try it first. Bi loved the coverage & colors.
B0014C8COY|5|perfect for everyday use. Not too greasy and rated high on EWG skincare database.
B001AO0WCG|5|I enjoy using your Moroccan Oil Hair Treatment. I like the smell of the oil. I think I will order more in near future.
B005JNOTPK|2|I HAVE USED THIS PERFUME FOR YEARS . HOWEVER, THIS BOTTLE SMELLS LIKE IT IS OLD. I AM NOT THAT HAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE.
B003CCPH06|5|I love it. I love you all for bringing it into my life!<br /><br />Found this product because of its Amazon fandom and I am so glad I tried it! It's crazy that someone it just blends perfectly into my skin, even though the color looks so light. No smell to it from my experience. Gorgeous texture. I use a stippling technique to apply it and it just goes on some smoothly and covers moderate imperfections well. Perfect for daily wear.
B00K6CPGE2|5|I loved them
B00NW5G4PA|5|exactly like the picture
B00EYZY5TY|4|It's funny how the more \\"advanced\\" chemicals the society produces to help us clean our hair, the worse our hair becomes, and then requires more products to repair the damage. Just saying...<br /><br />This Fekkai shampoo is recommended by the maker to use as a weekend clarifier for damaged hair. I don't know what happens if you use it daily; might be too harsh for daily use? It smells good and does make my hair feel smoother and more natural after use. I also have a conditioner from the same company and that seems to go well with this shampoo.
B004DBUAGQ|5|Obsessed ! I love this dry shampoo, I have used almost every brand out there and nothing compares. I love the smell love the way my hair looks ! will not buy anything else!
B00176GSEI|5|Great on my straight, fine blonde hair and the curls stay!
B000XEDES8|5|Lovely scent, lots of compliments
B000WUHAG0|5|Once you try it, it will be your only one.  That's what my friend who owned a health food store told me.  She was right.  The next day after I tried it, I threw all the other chapsticks out.  My chronically chapped lips were healed.  And as I discovered, if you use it at the first sign of a cold sore, you probably won't have one.  If it gets away from you, at least it won't hurt, and it will heal sooner.<br /><br />MSM is an extremely powerful anti-inflammatory pain killer, which is why your lips won't hurt, and a super-charging healing substance.<br /><br />Put some on every night before you go to bed, and your troubles are over.  Nice, smooth, fresh lips.  No more chapping.  Lovely.
B003O9RAWU|1|Great trimmer-- poor charger.  Lasted 1 yr 1 mo-- no warranty and NOW discontinued--  probably want to go with another brand.
B002KGW6VI|5|My favorite eyeliner! Stays on all day and is easy to use!
B0030HSD40|4|excellent item, solved my problem
B00AO6ULE0|1|Not the same as pictures in the ad.  I was sad, the red is everywhere and way too bright for what is shown.
B00132ZG3U|5|Works perfect! Isn't to powerful but gets the job done. Less loud than my last dryer, and also lighter. I love the fact that it is lightweight because I have to dry a LOT of hair and this is an easy to handle dryer. The various settings are also nice - can't go wrong for the price!
B00GQ9I9IO|5|I love this product, after using it for one month I can see the results.  Just ordered 2 more bottles.  Would not want to be without.
B00HRKXT4K|5|Great experience ordering this bracelet. It was exactly as described although a better quality than expected.  Made a nice gift.  Thanks!
B006SVCY6I|5|I previously only owned about 6 make-up brushes and my mom asked me if she could have my brushes so she could use them 'cause she didn't have any, I obviously declined. That is, until I found these and ordered them for myself, I love them! There are so many different style brushes and they are all in great condition, especially for the price. I washed my old brushes and let my mom have them, I kept these all to myself!
B001WAKUVG|5|This cleanser came with my Nutrasonic and I had no intention of using it, since I really liked my current cleanser.  But after a few weeks I was curious, and to my surprise, liked this one even more.  You need just a tiny amount, so it will really last, and it rinses so easily and completely I don't need a toner.  Also like that it's made from natural botanicals, not a mess of chemicals.  Recommend highly.
B004E2TV6Y|5|This is the best supplement I have found to induce feelings of calm. I've tried a lot of things for stress, and this one really works.
B00WHES3M4|5|Bought this as a gift for my wife with a few other things since I got a discount. It is her favorite color. Besides the sale/discout, I thought she needed a new one because hers is covered in eyeliner or mascara or something. Anyway, she uses it so I'm sure it works great! Her lashes look flawless, but they always do.
B0078PVAK4|5|It really does what it says it will
B00324DNF0|5|OMG I love this perfume. The scent is soft yet alluring. I turn heads everytime I wear it. Go order you a bottle today, you won't be disappointed.
B00ADRGV26|4|I got this at a local store. It is an okay mascara. Doesn't really have eyelash extending characteristics and it doesn't bulk up the eye lashes too much. It kind of just makes the eyelashes a bit more visible and gels them in place. It is great for daily wear or girls who don't want the too much make up look. If you are getting mascara for clubbing or fancy events, go for something else.
B003QYFVRY|5|This product cleans my teeth very well by electronically moving the bristles faster against my teeth than I ever could.<br /><br />I guess that pretty much sums up any electronic toothbrush.  Further, I have not used any other ones ever.<br /><br />So why do I give it five stars?  I guess because it does its job.  It is sturdy.  I know this because I have dropped it a number of times but it still works well.<br /><br />The only flaws in it are that it will automatically stop when I am brushing (maybe this is because I dropped it?  I don't know) and the cavity and screw threads where the replacement head screws in get moldering filthy if one does not clean there pretty much every time after a use.<br /><br />I figure these are not too much considering what is a great product overall.
B007L851Z8|5|The color is fabulous it really stands out because it's metallic...love it so much, I'm glad I got this
B00CX7GE9E|5|The best body cream. My wife gets a new supply every Mother's Day and Birthday. The variety pack is nice to have three choices for particular likes that day. Also, good price from Amazon.
B000MGPNN6|5|This has just the right amount of stiffness for my scalp.<br /><br />It's also quite durable, and the handle has a backing that makes it less wobbly than other brushes.<br /><br />For a simple plastic brush, it looks like more thought was put into it than usual!
B0006HRCL2|5|Perfect. In love and extremely easy to use.
B00A5X5IPO|1|Smooth application, but it is NOT waterproof.  I wore it for 3 hours and raccoon eyes ...
B004FJPBRE|4|I have not had the opportunity to use it.  It seems like it will do the trick.  I have not used the purse for which I bought this.
B004CQXZ5U|5|I first began using Olay facial cleansers for travel because they are so easy to  pack and take up so little space in my luggage.  I liked them so much that they are now my only facial cleanser whether at home or on the go.  They do a good job of removing makeup including mascara with no irritation to skin or eyes.
B000CC3J2C|2|We used this product religiously for several weeks and I don't think it did my daughter any good.  We finished the bottle and switched to regular moisturizer.  A couple more weeks later, her body finally recognized the molluscum and attacked the bumps - they became very red, but then disappeared soon.  If either of my children ever get molluscum again (and I really, really hope they don't!), we will just keep their skin very moisturized and wait for their body's immune system to recognize the bumps to heal them.  (Which is what our pediatrician recommended in the first place.)
B002GKS03G|4|Love this..
B004RSQG3G|5|I like it because it has sunscreen in it. It is good because when I camp my lips getter chapped and other lip balms burn my lips. It also is good because it has no scent or flavor so it doesn't inhibit taste when you eat or drink
B00ATS24EI|5|After using this peeling my skin like feels like silk. love it
B0055WNFXW|4|got this for my husband who now travels frequently for work..he really likes it, nice size fits all his toiletries and hangs nicely to be able to conveniently see and get to the items, great price too!
B00HOHLKY2|5|Wonderful product! I will be purchasing again.
B00D2JAKY2|1|Ok
B007EDFV9Q|5|Love this product!!!
B00LKM6VX2|5|nice-thanks
B0026XQU6C|5|I have fine, wavy hair that tends to be flat at the top when I grow it out past my shoulders. This spray definitely gives it a boost while not looking sticky or unnatural. I spray it at the roots section-by-section through the top third of my hair and then blow dry upside-down and I get some great volume.<br /><br />Some complaints:<br />-I don't usually have to shampoo my hair every day, but this spray makes me look greasy the next day. I have light blonde hair though so product is more likely to show, and shampooing each day is a small price to pay.<br />-The smell isn't great. But it goes away once it dries.<br /><br />Overall, great product. I would give it a try.
B005KQ97IA|1|Sent me one pack of razors, where the hell is the other 35 ?<br />How would you be able to break out a pack of 36, and then, only send me one pack of 2 ??<br />HOW?
B000P250YY|2|Do not like the scent. I so wish I could still get the original LIZ eu de parfum
B007URREXW|5|I am a redhead with lashes that are light brown and the base and get darker towards the ends. If I don't wear mascara (and I really am not a make-up kind of girl), then my eyes look small and kind of blend in rather than stand out- hence, in public I am usually wearing sun glasses if I'm too lazy for mascara.<br /><br />I found this and figured I'd give it a try- went with the black blue bc I wanted the darkest shade I could get.<br /><br />So far I've used it 2x. It has lasted very well- and I only did it the 2nd time to get the new growth. I have also taken before and after pictures and it is like night and day! No longer do I even think twice about leaving the house mascara-less!<br /><br />Now... Two things to note:<br /><br />1st: I have issues getting the precise consistency when I mix it to be able to apply it smoothly to my lashes. This is obviously my error, and I'm sure the more times I use it the better I'll get<br /><br />2nd: the package says to not use on your eyelashes- but duh... That's what it's for. I'm sure it's a liability issue that makes them state that. If you are uncomfortable buying a product for your eyes that says not to use on your eyes- then this is not for you!<br /><br />I love this- it seems the one bottle I have will last for quite some time- but when I do run out I will not hesitate to repurchase!
B00A7KTYO6|5|My favorite cologne of all time! :D sweet smell yet masculine in a way :)
B004D1BBNW|5|Best thing I have found. Being allergic to insect bites was torture but with Mitigator the bites are almost gone the next morning. No more days of suffering through the itch. Sending some to my granddaughter who of all things to inherit was my allergic reaction to insect bites.<br />Looked for it in the stores but no one is selling it. Thank you Amazon!
B0009JMCQ2|5|Got the sample, wore it out for a few weekends and got tons of compliments. This is a classy, refined smell that doesn't over power like a lot of the bargain-bin colognes do. After I finished the sample, I picked up a full size bottle and it has been a big part of my normal rotation since.
B002EP9OUG|3|I gotta get some practice but over all works good. I prefer the strips of paper rather then waiting for the wax to cool off. and I could never get a good grip to take it all off with one try. Also it might help to see the instructional dvd cause I didn't watch it. And it does take over an hour to heat up
B00VVWF26S|5|This is a perfect case for your essential oils. It is compact, durable and attractive. Padded to protect your glass containers and case is well constructed. Love it!
B005WWQXB6|5|Great brush for de-tangling/general brushing. Glides through my thick, coarse hair with easy, and the pink color is super cute.
B00LEDLCGI|2|Lasted less than a week.
B000PKIMGO|5|love love this deodorant  for many years fast delivery!
B000NL3RKQ|5|Special Effects is by far the best vibrant color demi permanent dye I've ever used. I've used three colors (vintage rose, pimpin purple, blue velvet) and they hardly fade and fade very evenly. I've not noticed that one fades much faster than another and I use all three colors together. My only suggestion to keep the color as long as possible is to use an all natural cleansing conditioner (wen $30+, RenPure$8) instead of shampoo. This will help if you bleach your hair heavily before coloring also. I have very oily skin, so my scalp gets oily super fast and not cleaning my hair daily isn't an option. I've had these colors in for three weeks so far with very little fading and I wash my hair with cleansing conditioner daily.
B009STW0QG|4|I like it as its pretty natural, but it is quite expensive.<br />I know you don't have to use much so guess hats why its so high.
B00AE9307M|1|BEWARE!  entire label is in Italian!<br /><br />does NOT get rid of orange!
B006O8FPIY|5|very good on face, very light.
B003F8IBDC|5|This really cleanse the hair extremely well and I liked it for a daily shampoo
B00A0REL30|5|the best curling iron EVER!!!!!
B00KQASCDG|4|When I first put some on, I was immediately startled by its barbecue-like smoky smell, which fortunately, does fade fairly quickly.  After some research, I now see that the smell is natural in unrefined Shea, AND will go away with whipping in a bit of essential oil.  I think I'll try that because I love the way my skin feels after using this product.
B009NQKKMU|3|Kind of dull
B00ESYFGVM|2|These are small, and they don't stick on very strongly. Actually, they hardly stick on at all. But, this didn't really matter for my purposes, seeing as I just wanted the outline of them to draw a winged eyeliner stencil on an index card.
B008B9K8JA|5|smells great!
B001PP3OF2|5|I utilize the entire PCA line and love it. I was recommended to begin using this line to help w/ my pigment issues. I started by purchasing the trial size pigment set and loved it. I also highly recommend the pigment bar as a cleanser! This product along with the entire product line has done wonders  for my skin in just 6 weeks. This is great for under eye circles as well as pigment and scaring issues.
B0062IWQVU|5|I recently received a ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer through a promotion by Gillette. Previously I have had to use a hair trimmer to help trim and maintain my beard. While it's not very thick and not very long, it's still a hassle to have to keep it trimmed down and this has so far been the best tool to use for this task.<br /><br />The Power Trimmer is very likely going to replace my hair trimmer for this purpose. It didn't catch on hair when I was using it and kept everything uniform as I trimmed my beard down. The styler also helped me keep an even growth after I had shaved so that I was keeping straight lines along my jaw line.<br /><br />There are only three attachments for trimming and they are all relatively close in length. I don't believe there are any extra extensions for this but that would be one downside in terms of growing a longer beard. I also don't have very thick facial hair, so I'm not entirely sure how well this would work on a more fuller beard.<br /><br />The actual handle and tool is just a bit larger than a regular razor blade system, like the Fusion ProGlide, and is very lightweight and portable. The razor blade and the trimmer attachments slide onto the handle and a small eject button easily removes them.<br /><br />The entire kit comes together in a small package, about the size of a new razor, and the components fit together in a plastic holder so you can keep things organized and not just sliding around in a drawer.<br /><br />All in all this will definitely find a permanent home in my bathroom for my future grooming needs.
B0007X74OK|5|Quality of this hairspray is the best.  It has a very fine spray which holds for a great length of time without feeling sticky.  Even though it is more costly than many other hair sprays, it lasts longer.  Only spray I use.
B00365DABC|5|Great basic moisturizer.
B00A35XU7M|2|Corvalen - M by Sedona Labs,  was never received!  It was never ordered that I remember. My husband is now having health issues with heart, kidney, atrial fibrillation, and high blood pressure.  Therefore many of the items ordered for his use is no longer<br />acceptable according to the doctors.<br /> Please contact with order info.???????????????????, will appreciate your immediate assistance.  The items need to be returned<br />as stated above.<br />Thanks,<br />Elaine A. -- Fl.
B005UBN2AO|3|This does the job and absorbs the greasiness in my hair if I don't have time to wash it.  The problem I have is with the spray.  I have to always spray some into the sink to get the product going which is annoying.  There is a strong perfume fragrance to it which I don't mind.  Considering that I use it when I can't wash my hair, I'm always self conscious that my hair stinks.  I have black hair and it will look grey if I don't work in the dry shampoo enough.  Otherwise, this is a decent dry shampoo.  I might try something else when this runs out to see if there's anything better.
B00WS7C614|3|not as dark as i thought i was going to be !
B001TLLRWY|5|Arial red! I have had people comment it is the perfect shade of red and get compliments daily!
B00ICN8LBW|5|after i got this and tried it .. it worked grate best 80 i ever spent .. do not buy the cheap ones they will brake and get stuck .. i recommend this one
B001TSKTBM|4|I think it's a little too early to tell yet. I see some growth and will continue to use !
B00H56KCUU|4|pretty good primer.
B003V5CTP0|5|Works well.
B005AN3AGI|5|so far very good !
B0049G7ILA|3|These are well made. The tips are too thick for me though
B000FS05VG|5|This dryer was everything I expected it to be.  The dryer has too attachments that are great for curly hair.  I would recommend this to anyone.
B0058OW9NO|5|I love these... I bought another set for a gift... Amazing liquid eye liner!!:-)
B00NTHKQZ0|1|DO NOT BUY. This is fake Dermablend. OLD, fake Dermablend. If negative stars were possible...
B00GTJCH2K|5|great color ...... Seem to be made well
B0079R6BD2|3|I have been using it for a few week already and I do feel that my hair is not falling as much. But I am also taking hair vitamins so maybe it is the combination of both. I do love the fact that it is organic.
B002DMK0J4|5|Love that this is a spray product.  Just spray your hands and let them dry.  The scent is best described as clean grapefruit.  I like it.  The active ingredient is Ethyl Alcohol (same as Purell and Germ-x).  After use your hands feel fresh but not dry.
B0076KAPO8|5|the tip makes a perfect cat-eye line and it never dries out. i finally replaced mine after like 2 years, but moreso because the cap was broken. the liner still worked great.
B004JLEGM4|5|Great product, leaves my skin very smooth, and I have very dry skin.
B00APT4S7C|5|I have been using a Phillips Sonicare for about the last five years and had the opportunity to replace it with this Panasonic EW DL91. I keep this plugged in an outlet in my bathroom. I love the power of this mighty Tooth Brush! My teeth feel so clean after brushing! The Panasonic seems to have a lot more vibration than my old Phillips Sonicare. I like the design,in regards to, how the brush attaches to the base. There is no hollow base like there was with my old Sonicare where gook could build up. The Panasonic is lightweight and portable and has a linear drive motor. The linear motor operates at 28, 500 brush stokes per minute. I like the 2 vibration modes, one slower and the other faster. The brush timer pauses once every 30 seconds and twice every 2 minutes which indicates the recommended total brushing time. Brushes included triple brushing head that is designed for the surface of the teeth and between teeth and gums. 100% waterproof includes carrying case and illuminated display charger or brush head holder. Dimensions 6.5 inch height x 1 inch width x 1.1 inch depth, 4.4 ounce.  Panasonic warrants this for 2 years. Replacement brushes look like they run around $30.00 for a three pack. That is less than replacement brushes for the Sonicare. The only thing I wish they had included was a tooth brush head cover. I really don't like leaving my tooth brush head exposed. I am using the head cover off the Phillips Sonicare replacement brush, which fits nicely on the Panasonic as well. I hope this lasts a long time and the power stays consistant with use. I have struggled with gum disease for many years and I highly recommend purchasing this product or one like it. It really makes a big difference! With regular Dental visits and using this type of toothbrush, the routine has kept my gum disease under control. I could never go back to using a regular tooth brush! Well worth the investment!!
B00MOU5NRE|5|Wonderful product, can't go without it!
B000Z63V96|5|I have been fighting acne for the past 4-5 years. Murad products helped me for about 3 years then stopped working.  I have been skeptical of &#34;natural&#34; skin care products and was introduced recently to Arcona at the salon where I went for a facial.  My skin has been completely clear since using this bar along with Arcona AM Acne Lotion.  It's been 3 months and I am so happy to have clear skin again after 2 years with constant blemishes on my face.
B004NNNY4Y|5|I have been wearing Di Gioria for about 3 years and I love it!  I loved that this was the big size too!
B00K5K6WSE|3|ok
B000US25A0|5|I researched countless cosmetics companies in order to find cruelty-free (no animal testing!), vegan products (no animal ingredients!), and also referenced each ingredient at the cosmetics safety database (where we can find out how harmful each ingredient is ~ or isn't ~ to our bodies and the environment). Ecco Bella's ethics & ingredients passed my test! I ordered this eyeliner in \\"Velvet\\" and it is absolutely great! I love how soft and smoothly it glides on! I cannot stand dry, hard liners that pull at the delicate skin around eyes. It has rich pigment, and can be used to create a defined line, or smudged for a smokey eye look if you choose. This is the ONLY eyeliner I will buy again ~ I love it, and I love to support cruelty-free companies that use high quality, vegan ingredients that really work and look great! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!! Check out the Ecco Bella website for LOTS more products for face, eyes, lips ~ WONDERFUL STUFF!!! This is one of my FAVORITE companies since my research!
B004WPI24K|5|Moisturizes skin and leaves it incredibly soft. Love it!
B00440F3GS|4|It trims. And that's it. No bells or whistles. You're not going to get a close shave, but I don't think that's what's advertised, and for the people that are complaining about that. They should probably learn how to read.
B0006TQZMM|4|This is a good product but a bit overpriced.  I would order again if the price becomes more reasonable.
B004NMTMUK|5|Not a solid color. Not transparent either. I was hoping for it to be a solid, so I just applied over another color. Nice amount of glitter! Never had any issues with this brand.
B002KCCEGO|5|This is so much better than the shower puff things, because it's long enough to easily scrub your back. It's pretty scratchy when you first get it, if you're not used to using something like this, but then you get used to it, and it works really well. I left mine in a hotel room, and I liked this so much, I had to order a replacement.
B00011JOPK|4|Pretty great comb!
B00VUB4IFG|5|My wife and I aren't typically bar soap users, but we received a sample of this one and were pleasantly surprised! It smells fresh and clean, lathers up nicely and doesn't leave our skin feeling dry. I've actually started using it in place of my previous face wash, and haven't had any blemishes since! Once we are done with this bar, we will be buying more.   Update - 2/27/16:  Once we finished the sample soap, I immediately purchased a new bar.  My face continues to stay clear and I'm excited to be using a product that will not have a negative impact on the environment (I'll be discontinuing use of previous face wash products that contain plastic micro-scrubbers).    One tip I can offer, as other reviewers have stated, store the bar in a dry soap dish in between uses. If it is constantly getting wet from the shower water, it will not last long.  I just use the bar on my face daily and have managed to get about 2-3 months of life out of it.

B00FYY741U|5|i was afraid it was going to be a little stinky to the eyes because of the smell but it wasnt. it was soothing, smooth, and easy i love it. on thoes days you know you got work early so you dont get much sleep. atleast your boss wont know (:
B002WJHKMS|5|This is such a wonderfully scented candle!  Helps provide a very calm atmosphere and is slow-burning.  Great!
B006VDSO0I|5|It defined my hair and helped to de-frizz,and I have THICK Long Hair,I Love All of Alterna Bamboo Products Now!!!
B00JTY6WQ4|4|.....Sorry this review was for another product, this derma roller was annoying.
B0029W1K92|4|Bought this for my husband to use because he has naturally dry skin/scalp, and I hoped a nicer shampoo would be gentler on his hair. He has used it for a year, and says he likes it, particularly the minty scent. It seems to have helped the dry scalp to some degree, as I notice less flakes, but there are still some occasionally, however that may just be due to genetics. I will definitely buy this again for him; the 33.8 oz bottle lasts over a year at our house.
B00912ZFQ2|5|I was looking for a shampoo and conditioner with natural ingredients and were also cruelty-free. ABBA Color Protect Shampoo and Conditioner fulfills both those requirements.Oh, and they clean and condition well too!
B00CGUJN82|4|Nice For summer. Very light at least Over my skin
B003V57Q5I|5|I love the subscribe & save!  I have such oily skin.  This product helps me feel refresh and not weighed down because of the oil.
B006A9XS4K|5|Shipped quickly. Very nice product and works on delicate skin, like mine.
B000RYYI7K|5|love this!
B00642NPOQ|5|It is a very good smelling Eau De Toilette but if you are interested you should know that 14 oz is a very small amount. Price seems to be high considering a fact it is not parfume.
B001ALNG8G|5|These clips fit my large ( 1 1/4 &#34;) rollers perfectly. Would buy again if needed
B00B2KALMY|3|because it feels soapy I have to rinse before leaving the shower, after towel drying there is nothing left on the skin. I would not buy this again.
B0036GGFF4|5|I like this
B005MQ3Y3M|4|Great soap we go through a lot of it, aloe is super soothing to skin so it helps with dry skin. It also doesn't have triclosan in it so its healthier soap. It smells good too. I have it at all my sinks and will continue to buy it.
B009DF7LZU|5|Love the smell!  It has a smooth, silky feel after applying it. It is a very nice lotion with easy application.
B00BSNBO9O|5|Good for dry skin! Love it!
B000BH92J2|5|I absolutely love shea moisture shea butter! It is a bit thick...well very thick but you don't need much! It immediately moisturized my hair and soften it beyond recognition! I have 4b hair, thick full, kinky hair and it made for a wonderful moisturizing conditioning. I personally still use kinky curly  knot today to detangle my hair, but it dries my hair, so to replenish my hair, i use this leave in conditioner and it is wonderful!
B00Y0T7LPY|5|I am always looking for new facial moisturizers to try — my family has a history of dry skin, and living in a state where air conditioning everywhere only exacerbates this hereditary condition leaves me on the hunt for a newer and better product. Bleu Beaute's Rose Water Spray is my latest find, and I must say that I have been very pleased with the results so far. I have been using it once a day for about two weeks now and have noticed improvements: my skin is moisturized without that greasy residue that a lot of lotions leave behind, and my blackheads have all but disappeared! I can actually feel my pores becoming unblocked. The bottle has enough to last you a while as long as you are not wasteful with the product, and the MOISTURIZER itself has a fresh, inviting aroma and feel. Rosewater is a great ingredient, and I'm happy to see it used in such a natural and healthy way. I especially liked how effective the rose water was at soothing irritated and rough skin. I wholeheartedly recommend this product to anyone looking for a no-frills but effective facial moisturizer.
B0014407HC|4|It does helps with wrinkle plus it provides great moisture. A little pricey but it is cheaper than many other Wrinkle Defense creams.
B00DW2QPP2|5|These are so lovely and just perfect for the nails.  Got these for a girl who is into the new Disney movie, frozen.  Perfect match for the theme.
B006N8KO2C|5|These lip pencils are wonderful!  Excellent high-quality and long lasting.  I love them, especially since I am allergic to tube<br />lipstick but not to these pencils.  The color I bought is also hard to find which makes it even more important to me.
B004D281FC|5|Does a really good job on these over 60 plus hands use at night no oder and goes on smooth soaks right into skin YEAH.ORDERED THE PACKAGE OF TWO FER
B0038ZXYP2|2|Well, I tested this out today and attended the Feast of San Genaro. It is not greasy and very light, almost too light that it leaves you looking very, very dry. :( I don't know who said that it doesn't leave a white cast because it does! That's just on my body though---my face was a different story. It made me look paler and dead. Now, I don't know what to use. I am sad.
B00DHX11L4|1|WAY TOO SMALL!!! i cant even fit my pencils in it.
B010SWOMUS|5|The tattoos were a great price considering how expensive they are and I liked the designs.
B001FVSEI8|5|I love its alcohol free, natural, and scent free. I will not feel itchy to use it and it works quite well for immediate hydration on skin.
B000850C1Y|5|A common misconception is that there is a \\"best\\" type of razor blade. In fact, blade preference is highly personal. The \\"best\\" blade is the one that gives you the best shave, regardless of what anyone else says. I like these blades. I find them sharp without being overly aggressive. They also hold an edge well without dulling quickly.<br /><br />I would recommend these to anyone searching for the perfect blade. These blades are generally considered above-average quality. They are sharp, but not the sharpest or most aggressive blade available, falling right in that range where most people like them a lot. I can't promise they'll be the best blade for you, but I do suggest you give them a shot and see how they work for you.
B00Q78C1EW|5|Stopped my leg cramps almost instantly!
B006RFZ5ZM|1|Because it has fragrance in it, my skin broke out after 1 use. I don't recommend for acne prone, sensitive skin.
B000GARPSE|5|This is a great organic hand lotion. I have very sensitive and dry skin and this does a great job of hydrating my skin without leaving it oily or slippery. The best part is that it is one of the few organic lotions that does NOT contain phenoxyethanol! :) This preservative is found in a lot of &#34;paraben free&#34; lotions. While this preservative only got a 4 on skin deep, there is limited data available regarding its safety and that data is conflicting. The European Union classifies it as an irritant. In my opinion, I would rather avoid it until theres more information regarding its safety.
B00DPE9EQO|5|Love it! I have used this serum daily, morning and night, for the last month and a half and am hooked. My skin is super soft and my pores are virtually invisible. I use this after my rober, then I apply the OZ hyaluronic acid and then add my moisturizer. I also apply it this way to my neck and d&eacute;collet&eacute;. Fantastic! Soft, smooth skin.  And it's all natural. I would read the negative reviews with a grain of salt. I'm so happy I tried this brand.
B0017BD4RC|2|I purchased two bottles of this cream because of the reviews.  Man, oh man...I wish I hadn't.  I cannot even use it.  I wound up giving it away.  It is far too sticky to be able to use it and perform any tasks at all.  The smell isn't bad, but, it isn't really great.  The major issue is with the consistency and the fact that it doesn't soak into the skin at all.  I actually put it on at night and put on gloves so that it was on over night.  It did nothing for my nails (AT ALL!) and hardly soaked in then, either!  This product is not what it claims to be.
B00AP71KWA|5|wesome. Love it, great cleanser and face wash trusted name brand and product I totally recommend it to face washers
B000P0FR1C|5|I received the flat-iron brand new in a timely manner.  I love the flat-iron, actually I ordered another one 3 weeks later.  That is how much I love FHI flat-irons. Thanks.
B005NISIFS|5|Quality product Quick shipping
B00B5AOLCM|5|This is not a cheap cap. It is well made. I got it because I dye my hair, and do not want it wet every morning. It fits perfect, and does not pinch my head. Or slip down on my face. It just stays where I put it. Great product.
B004SU8EKG|5|Easy to use and works fast. My daughters and I all have thin hair but lots of it and it sure makes our hair look thicker
B006D0PTPM|4|Dove Clinical Protection goes on easy and has a nice pleasant scent. It lasts a good long time and doesn't seem to cause any skin irritation. I don't quite get what benefits the \\"Clear Tone Skin Renew\\" tagline are supposed to provide, but as a antiperspirant/deodorant, I can recommend it.
B00578ZBEU|4|It last very long time, also pretty invisible compare to other porducts. It's good for both daily and special event.
B000U6I6Q4|5|Does what you need it to do and lasts a good long time.  I like the two sides of the stone block too.  One side for really rubbing down the callous and the other side to make your skin smooth and soft afterward.  I will buy this brand from now on.
B002DW9662|5|This shaver gives a close shave with little irritation. It is not the fastest but I did not bump afterwards.  I would recommend highly for those with sensitive skin. Just a tip... use at least every other day because it does not do well with longer hairs.
B00GQ9I9IO|4|Company has great customer service. Excited to use this product.
B000AA9HOA|5|Awesome product. My scalp hasn't itched or been dry for several weeks. Can't wait to buy more. This product is not smelly. Just a little sticky.
B008KEMB9G|5|very gritty great boards i love them.
B004UBC6VG|5|Great product!
B00T12C754|5|Argan oil is the most wonderful product!  Great for nails, hair and skin.  I use this daily with great results!  Good price.  Nice quality product.
B004FOZJ4Y|3|This is a great soap, but it seems to be too thin. I bought this as a Dr. B replacement, but it seems to be too watery for some uses. I like it, but I go through it faster than other liquid castile soaps I've had.
B00HZC0XMQ|3|The colour is not as pink as in the picture so was disappointed. Also it burns my lips for about 5 minutes until it dries. The colour however is very vivid and if you choose the right colour you will be pleased with its richness
B00H3CXED8|5|Item received just as described and shipping dates were right on the money! Would buy again and highly recommend!
B004SSIW5K|5|Loved it!  Very happy spring!  The blue was not a bright blue so it can be worn to a conservative work environment!  A must have in your Gelish collection!
B00D9GXAWM|5|GREAT design for CK-2-GO!!!  .68 ounces never looked & travelled SO WELL...Thank YOU!! :)
B002MYFAIO|4|I have thin hair and a slightly bold spot in my front section. Ornanin works pretty well to cover it. So it works great for me, I used to use an eye shadow to paint my scalp and make Look the area fuller, organon is much easier and quick. I recommend this product for this kind of problems, for someone that is too bold it will require to much time and product, for this type of person is not worth it for a daily solution.
B005FT3I6Y|5|I love this fragrance. It glides on as smooth as silk. It makes my skin feel and smell so fresh and clean.
B001F51Q8Y|1|I was out of toothpaste, so I gave the crest pro-health a try. I used it for about 3 days and the skin in my mouth was peeling away as a gooey slime. I now have the worst canker sore in my mouth and it hurts to talk, let alone brush my teeth. Do not use. You will regret it.
B0085A18A8|5|Works great! I am very satisfied with it! It actually cuts the hair and doesn't pluck or tug. Not loud, looks nice with it's sleek design.
B0079HNKLI|3|this one last longer just need to be mix with the lighter one for my complextion
B008VSYO5A|5|Some people didnt like these due to the price however i think for the price it is awesome it cleans your body and is dove im not going to have the lemon aroma forever sooooo its all good
B003RW2K0G|5|I have thick, curly, frizzy, and generally unmanageable hair. This is one of the few creams that works for me. Keep in mind that the cream is heavy and thick. If you are looking for something lightweight this wouldn't be for you. This is for seriously curly hair. ;)
B00QR6SS6O|5|This has so many uses but my big favorite is to keep the refrig (reefer & freezer) smelling clean, and it does just that.  The orange oil is also good.  Put 1/4 teas. in small baking-soda box.  This can also be used for cooking, and for purifying 'undesirable' house odors.  They also give you a dropper that few others do.  And for $13.00, U get two(2) of this wonderful smelling magic. // Big O five stars for them.
B009IFGU84|1|This case is cheap. The line decoration around the cover fell off within two weeks.  I do not recommend this product!
B00KO92YW4|5|Love this color!!!!
B00TSQX6BW|5|Gorgeous set! Beautiful box would make for an excellent gift or storage solution for one's beauty station. Absolutely adorable. The quality of the products is second to none - they smell fabulous and feel great on the skin. Decadent lotions, divine serums and rich oils create an elegant set that would be wonderful for travel. Though there are no instructions included, there is a list of ingredients which boast things such as:<br /><br />pink grapefruit essential oil<br />organic green tea<br />pumpkin seed oil<br />papaya<br />organic ginger enzyme<br />dead sea concentrate and minerals<br />organic rosemary<br />organic cinnamon<br />passionflower<br />shitake mushroom extract<br /><br />These ingredients work together to create some wonderfully enticing smells and certainly create the Sublime experience. There is quite an extensive collection of elixers, for a range of uses. I'm particularly excited about the facial oil, it is one of my favorite products and the little spritz bottle is perfection. I'm a huge fan of the day cream, which has SPF protection and is great for re-applying and touch ups on the sunny days.<br /><br />I am so glad I had the chance to review some samples for testing purposes, I think the richness and creamy textures feel like heaven on the skin and I would definitely recommend many of these individually; however, the sampler is great for getting to try each one and how they work together. Fantastic service and I am already checking out the website and subscribing for updates - I can't wait to see what else they come up with!
B003UKKHB4|5|I did a lot of research and this was the one!  It does a GREAT job and is all I expected.<br /><br />One drawback:  kind of loud
B004INUWX0|1|Tangles your hair, makes it look frizzy too. Hard to get used to which side to rotate for the wanted style.
B00AFCOVEO|5|Do you want shiny and beautiful hair? I've tried everything out there. High to lower price points and this is the line that is the best ever.
B005TVSIQS|4|Faded to green rather quickly but I actually like that better than the initial color.
B00006K14U|1|There's hardly any &#34;scrub&#34; to this facial scrub.
B0089ZK1DY|4|Nice texture, smoothens the skin. Will definitively try it on for a longer period of time. A very good product for the price.
B00ESEC9JO|5|Great for traveling! I went on a 2 week vacation and this was perfect for light packing. I liked that everything was in one case--- just had to pack my mascara, eyeliner and lip gloss. I'm still using it after my trip at home.
B00DGXDL68|5|Prompt shipping, nice bottle, thank you!!!!!!!!!
B009XUNOHY|1|I will never purchase this product again. It is not as good as stated in reviews. The soap is harsh on my skin and dries it badly.
B00ARF44N2|5|I trim the hair of the guys close to me.<br /><br />This hair clipper works on bolding men as well as those who have a full head of hair and want to shave it all off. It does a nice job with trimming the bolding man's thin hair as well as cutting off the thick hair.<br /><br />It's definitely a step up from previous clippers I have tried (mostly in the $20-$40 range), but it also costs more than my previous foray into hair clippers, so I'm not sure if its fair to judge its performance based on that.<br /><br />It's easy to clean and charge.
B00GM7SA0C|5|Great product!
B001DJ15KG|1|Sticky like soap
B00FD3Z144|5|Great product for burns!
B00168538E|5|Best natural product for pimples, it clears them up in a day or two. I can't ever be without it.
B004UVYOZW|1|No. It plucks hairs, it takes forever over 1 hour for below the knee and I still needed to shave. It hurts. And it just doesn't work. Tried it a few times. And my sister in law did as well. Nope it's a dude.
B00JVXVCS6|5|Great stuff! Amazing for scars, heals them quickly. Shipment came fast. Would order again.
B003ZK8H1G|5|My wife was looking for a product to replace one called NOAH Mint Shampoo. I found this one and she is very happy with it.
B00GMRJWPY|5|I love this product.. it works like magic
B005OZLN84|5|I agree with the first post...I wish this would come in a bigger bottle! My hair (locs) and scalp are dry and flaky and just one spray of this formula and it's gone!  I am stocking up but wish that I could buy at least a 16 oz size bottle!
B004GHG8EK|5|Amazing... Love it.. Is my new must have mascara.
B00GM3G6ZW|5|Great
B007FIUC94|4|I highly recomend this brush. Its a great quality brush with super soft bristles and I just love the yellow bright handle, it also works great for concealer.
B000I5HJ2Y|5|It is a great tool for applying foundation. It gives a very even coverage and very easy to use. I love this product.
B00DGGG1IU|5|GOOD!!
B00ONB7XRK|2|This product is not what I expected. I am very disappointed. I thought it was more elegant and was made of leather instead of cheap plastic. The ability for it to be a kick stand isn't true. It keeps sliding and falling. You get what you pay for that's for sure!
B003ZYL2DW|5|The towelettes are perfect to toss in my gym bag when I need a quick clean up before my workout.  Then, after workout I use them again to freshen up!  The cream cleanser is gentle yet effective.  I am particular about cleanser due to eczema and this one didn't dry out my face....both excellent products!
B00340T6XU|5|This is the best. I dont know if it really does peel the skin. I know for sure the makeup residue is completely gone. It say not to use under the eyes but I do. Its fine.
B000Q1LJBW|5|awesome scent. I have the perfume and have had it for years but its fragrance did not change. I always receive compliments about how good I smell
B00RDEXY7C|5|A great purchase. Smells heavenly and works fab with my essential oils. Packaged well in shipment so no mess. Very pleased.
B007STDEOK|5|Makes my hands feel so smooth and it doesn't have much oil to it, so your hands dry instantly!
B005UF53WK|5|I purchased this product on a Carnival cruise ship in Europe for $19 several months ago, because I had left my cleanser at home. The wipes took all my make up off and left my skin feeling good. I found my skin responded well to the wipes. I only use one wipe, and it cleans well.  So imagine my surprise when I went to order them, they were not available in the U.S., but in the UK.  The price $3.33. I was so surprised. So I ordered several packages and I am set for a few months.  Carnival should be ashamed for charging so much. But I'm happy with my cleaning wipes.
B00DDQMO9S|5|Exactly what I was looking for-thank you!
B00IZAWB3G|2|Was lighter that expected, there for I do not like it. I may need to add a down penceil liner to my lip to make the stick appear darker. I only applied once and put it away after that. So if you have a hue on the lines of Gabriel Union then this will be too light for you.
B0009VQ8J2|4|Keeps skin from looking so bad as you get older.
B00641UCY8|4|This stuff is great! I mean I was really skeptical reading all of the great reviews; I am a 4b/4c/4z texture hair. I usually use u-part wigs to keep my hair protected. In the middle of the week, I try to do a moisturizing deep condition due to the change in weather (it's getting colder) and my low porosity hair, it is almost impossible to retain moisture in my hair.<br /><br />Then I stumbled across this product. While reading these reviews, I thought &#34;but will it work on my tightly coiled hair, tho?!&#34;  The answer is yes. This is great. I actually don't think I needed to do my usual deep condition after washing with this because my hair was soooooo soft; not like &#34;eww there is a product sitting on top of my hair&#34; soft, but a &#34;cuticles are laid, honey&#34; soft. I'm so thankful I cam across this product. I purchased mine at the local store because it was 40-50% less;  I also did like 3 washes with this ( I use a lot of oils for growth), and my hair was still not stripped. Love this product.
B00QT2Z2U6|5|Good
B00DPTW8JY|5|Very pretty, very well put together.
B003DMGNHQ|5|My very very favorite foundation. It's a little bit spendy, so sometimes I switch with other brands, but when I really want to splurge for myself this is always the foundation that I choose. This is a holy Grail product that really should not be overlooked!
B00H3BLU2Q|5|Great product for the price. Fast delivery!
B00065IBKK|3|Need to keep it plugged while using it! Fully charged battery lasts less than a minute
B0030ZRS7A|5|I have had multiple of these and I can tell you it definitely gets the job done. These look better than any other one I've seen, heats evenly for the most part, stir and you'll be fine. If you buy muslin by the roll be sure to pick up a pair of zig zag scissors I promise you, you will not regret it.
B00E5IAZGC|5|I have very thick, curly hair. After using this on my damp hair, it smoothed the frizz, and made my hair very soft, and my curls looked amazing. I would definitely recommend this for curly or wavy hair.
B0012RWNRS|1|When I saw the bottle of this perfume, I thought it was &#34;Emeraude&#34;, which I love,but it wasn't. Was not too happy with it. Gave it away.
B000BM67YA|5|I can apply it once in the morning and never have to worry about burning.  Previously, I had to reapply every 30 minutes and I still would burn.  This stuff is awesome!<br /><br />You will feel it on your skin for couple days or so afterward but it's worth it to not be burned to a crisp and to not develop skin cancer!
B0000Y3LOI|4|This stuff is really good. It helps if you use a sponge with this product because you get a better result than with just your fingers alone.
B004F80I14|5|Beautiful color and texture.  Moistens your lips too.  Makes my lips look kissably soft.  The color really accentuates my skin tone.  I just wish they were available in bigger sizes.
B00AYDN0EG|5|It is a wonderful product! Very smooth and wonderful for keeping my face clean but not oily. Works great with the matching loreal soap!
B0019RO78E|5|Great.Great smell! The ladies love it too!!!! RJ
B003VFQXHK|5|So glad that I was able to find this light hair dressing.  I did not think that it was being produced any longer.  Very good product!
B0094BQIQQ|5|I have uses this product before and love it's long lasting color but beware the staining of hands for the first month when washing your hair (every three days plus blow dryer) gloves everybody and sometimes color on your pillow.
B002XQ1YOU|5|Hands down,  this is my new favorite, replacing my #1 Salvatore Ferragamo Incanto perfume to #2. The smell is earthy, yet clean.  I see some reviews classify this as a summer perfume.  I can't pin it to a season.  It's a signature smell that you attach to an identity of a person,  not a season. It's a refreshing and ageless scent that you can and should use year round that is not over powering,  but a perfect balance.  Once someone smells this on you,  they will never forget it or you. It's classy and will leave an impression.
B00JAOUJ5I|5|This soap is awesome! I love how wonderful it smells! I also love how its all natural, I hate washing my face with chemicals... This soap is wonderful, and doesnt leave my skin feeling sticky like some other soaps.
B002HWS9GG|2|I purchased it on September 26, 2010. This product works great, and I loved it.  About a month ago, this product is starting to fall part.  The battery is no longer holding its charge, and the motor is starting to act up.  I expected to use this product without problems for over two years.  I am feeling cheated and unhappy with this purchase now.
B003PLFHC2|5|My hair was thinning slightly on top and I bought this product after others haven't worked.  This product worked for me and I plan to purchase the volumizing conditioner now.
B00021E6AM|5|I have always had difficulty with blackheads and sometimes I get whiteheads as well.  Whenever I have a facial, I have tons of \\"extractions\\" and am told that this is necessary to get my face as clear as possible.  So on my at-home spa days, I use this little tool to get the same results.  It is great for getting the \\"goo\\" out of some blackheads and other clogged pores, but I learned quickly that if it causes me discomfort, that is a zit I DO NOT want to use this on - it has lead to swelling and more redness, even when treated with topical medicine.  So use this to unclog some pores, but be careful where you apply it!
B00CMKIYEK|5|Was a gift for my daughter. Just the tool she wanted and works as she expected. She highly recommends it.
B00474YQN2|5|I have about 6 different colognes.  Hands down ... I get the most compliments when I wear this one from Tommy Bahama.  Not an overkill smell.  Such a clean ... fresh and sweet smell to it.  Almost of a smell after a rain up at the lake in the spring.  (if that made any sense!!)  Lasts a long time.  I get great long hugs from my wife and daughters when I wear this one!  On my fourth bottle.  Enjoy!!
B000T8AMH4|5|This, in conjunction with the Murad shave cream, has really seemed to contribute to a better shave and less iritated face.
B00AVNID00|1|Was very very disappointing to get this tiny bottle;  the picture looks like it is the full size one, but it is the miniature; my hair stylist sells a bottle three times as big as this one for $20; it is also not an american product (meaning the writing on it are a different language); very disappointed; go to your hair stylist and you can buy it cheaper and better...<br />on top of that by the time I realized it won't be here in the 'prime' window; I could not cancel the order any more...<br /><br />very very disappointment!!
B00SNWBRRM|5|Celebrate is my favorite Lush cream so far!!  Love it !
B00334UP96|5|I have always loved this powder.  I have oily sking and this does a great job of keeping the shine away.
B002I6E712|1|I wish I had the same experience as the five star reviewers, but...<br /><br />I've always had curly hair, beautiful spiral curls, but since my hair usually is a bit frizzy at the top, I've been using hair straighteners for years to smoothen out the frizz.<br /><br />I bought the Amika floating plates straightener at the airport in Amsterdam after the seller convinced me that the infra-red heat would do no damage to my hair, and even though it was way more expensive than any straightener I've ever bought, the life time guarantee sounded great.<br /><br />What I have found now, sadly, is that this one has done more damage to my hair than anything I've ever used. Some places are burnt and crunched up like hair that gets to close to fire. Some parts of my hair got burned and simply fell off.<br /><br />But the worst part: all my natural curls are now gone. My hair is just kind of wavy in a weird way. Every day is now a bad hair day :(<br /><br />I'm gonna see if I can return it and get my money back - but how to compensate for the damage? I guess I just have to wait for a few years until new hair has grown out.<br /><br />(My first negative customer review ever, but I really mean it. I don't recommend this to anyone, especially not if you have natural curls and want to keep them.)<br /><br />Love,<br />Ronja
B00W29NLZI|5|Great moisturizer. A friend told me about FACE FOOD.  As a physician I am skeptical about many products.  This moisturizer works great!  Minimal scent, goes on lightly but lasts a long time.  Easy to integrate into any daily regimen.  I recommend FACE FOOD for women and men.
B00E8M0WCC|5|that made me give up my OralB 40 after 45 years!  This is flat out the best toothbrush on the planet!  Try it.  Your teeth and gums will be glad you did!
B002VECKKG|5|Ordered it from Amy, because, I can't find it any longer.  The liquid is too thin to cover under eye circles or dark areas.  The cream is much better.
B00GSZNT04|5|I have been using Wen products for approximately 3 years now. I haven't used shampoo since I started using Wen and my hair is in the best condition. My favorite Wen is pomegranate and tea tree.  I would recommend Wen you won't be disappointed but you must use the recommended amount and leave it on as long as possible and rinse well = fantastic hair!
B000ILKUHY|5|I am very sensitive to fragrances; I have to watch out for strongly scented products because they will give me a headache. This stuff does have a somewhat strong smell but it doesn't bother me at all. It works well.
B00H028KCG|5|I love my box of hard candy make up. I shared it with my sister. I am really looking forward to purchasing more. Thanks for the great deal too by the way.
B001G7QSXO|5|This is a very good product!!!!
B00A013VZK|5|wonderful bag & VERRY beautiful! big enough to carry all my needs and the quality is GREAT!  I LOVE IT :)
B00NH1I50Q|4|This polish is a pretty gray hue with a tinge of violet.  It is a beautiful neutral color and would certainly work for the most conservative workplace.  This polish lasted nearly a full week without a chip, which I consider quite good.  It has a wide brush that makes for an easy application.  I used a ridge filling base coat, two coats of polish and Seche Vita top coat.  I don't really baby my manicure much and I'm pleased to say that this brand passed my test.  I consider this brand a high end polish although I have paid more for Chanel and Dior.  My all time favorite polish is Dior, which lasts a very long time without a chip and also has a wide brush.  What makes Dior polish so wonderful is their unique fashion forward colors.  Same is true with Chanel.  On the lower end, Essie has every color imaginable and it does last a while without a chip, depending on what base and top coats are used.  I like Sinful Colors base coat as well as the colored polishes.  For 2 bucks at Walgreens, they really do a good job, although the color selection is limited (they do come out with additional seasonal colors though).  This Nails Inc., polish is really pretty and I really like the way it lasted.  However, I don't think it's any better than the medium end polishes and I wouldn't pay more for it than it is in Sephora ($14).  The shipping charges wouldn't be worth it.  There has to be a limit somewhere right?  I'm giving this polish four stars mainly because the color is so pretty.  I received numerous compliments on it.  I'm taking a star off because I think the price is a bit high for this product, which really should be about $10.  I do recommend it though.
B004L5Y5C4|5|Love this product, it has great hold and love that it is all natural!
B00158MYUA|5|Great product. Does what they say it does.
B00J2APQBW|5|This is actually the best nail polish I've ever used, and I've tried a lot of polish. I bought it on a whim because it looked like a nice berry for fall, but I didn't expect miracles. I'm really shocked. I don't know why, but it is the only &#34;gel&#34; polish that doesn't chip on any of my nails within a day, and I have even tried a few real gel polish kits with UV light. The brush isn't the best shape for contouring around the cuticle, but I have found that the polish goes on best when you put a larger amount on the brush and blob it on the center of the nail, kind of wiggle the brush and work it toward the cuticle, and then smooth it with a few strokes toward the tip of the nail. I used it with a Seche Vite top coat and have gotten at least 7 days of decent looking polish all 3 times I've used this polish. It starts to look worn at the tips after a few days, but no chips to speak of. I'm amazed. I'm buying more colors right now because I hate having to paint my nails every other day.
B000C1ZB3I|1|It smelled stale. I would NOT recommend purchasing this. And you can NOT return it so that is really annoying!
B00LJ4EQWE|5|Other similar products only lasted weeks, I bought a 4-pack in January and I am still using the first body brush. Quality product!
B00O99DNS4|5|Much classier than the plastic tubes. And safer. These essential oils can eat away at plastics and glues. Use oil sparingly.  Amazing product.
B008WG7X8Q|4|This product is good.  I'm using it with bio oil to and it has reduced the appearance of my stretch mark.
B00GW9JOS2|4|Really good, lightweight shampoo and conditioner for my fine hair. Doesn't weigh it down!
B007M46CV8|1|I bought two of these thinking I was going to get the product I had originally used and bought in a store previously. When  I tried the product the consistency was way off. I believe it mostly water with a some diluted version of the real thing.<br />I will never buy from this company again. This is not the real product and feel I have been robbed. I do not recommend this company to anyone.
B00BAM7F8C|3|It is a good product. I bought over 100 because of the easiness of use compared to lotion or cream. However, it does not absorb to the skin as well as lotion or cream. Also, it has a variety of different ingredients, but you cannot feel the difference between them. You can buy just one type or mixed ones.
B00JGN2KI2|5|Very nice.  I wish the top shelf held some of the taller bottles of polish, but it's still a well made and pretty case.
B003TS1G26|4|My apron came quickly and was extremely cute! The material is a little thin/cheap but for the price this is wonderful!
B005UXZN04|5|I love perfume and I saw this bottle I had never seen or heard of this one before for the sheer look of the bottle and the top pink and beautifully designed it looks great and it have a lovely sent. yes I would recommend this product to everyone.
B009GYVMAS|5|Outstanding results! Worth having! Love the results!
B00AMB24XI|5|Love them! They are soo cute! And I wanted a black bow for my nails so I tried to paint one to see what it would look like and it worked and looked perfect! I would definitely recommend them!
B00AT0M68U|4|It's a great dryer. Drys hair very fast and isn't hot like ceramic dryers. Here in the South drying hair in the summer can be a sweltering experience but the Jose Eber Infrared Blow Dryer reduces the time it takes to dry your hair and the heat from the dryer. My only con comment is that it is heavier than most dryers. I have become use to the weight but it heavy for a hair dryer.
B0016D4RQS|5|smell so great!  definitely will buy again.  not too smokey.  nice variety pack.  no problems with them going out before theyve finished burning
B000OL8P7K|5|After reading that fluoride-toothpaste is harmful and I've had cavities (even on some fillings) over the past years even after developing a good oral hygiene, I decided it is time to try something new. Overall, the reviews seem to relay that Eco-Dent's toothpowder is good so I've been using it for two days and it definitely has a different but natural taste compared to toothpaste. I have never liked toothpaste at all. And the reason is I hate the smell of mint with a passion. I was very pleased to get the lemon-lime flavor. Doesn't taste bad at all. I can get very easily adjusted to it.<br /><br />[update (5-3-2012)]: I had my dental cleaning in April and I'm not sure what this toothpowder has done but it didn't make any improvements or appear to worsen my oral hygiene so it's hard to tell. I asked my dental hygienist if there was anything different with my teeth and gums before I told her that I've stopped using a fluoride-based paste. And it appears to be about the same. Also, she believes fluoride isn't a bad thing (not surprised). She asked what were the ingredients of the toothpowder since she never heard of it. At the end, she didn't persuade me to stop or keep using a fluoride-based paste. So I'll wait to the next dental cleaning to see. But in the meantime, I might continue using this toothpowder as well as a non-fluoride toothpaste to combat bleeding gums and fight tooth decay.<br /><br />[update 7-17-2014]: 2+ years later and I think I'll stick to this toothpowder. I went for a dental checkup a week ago with a new dentist (bare in mind that it has been 1 year since I have seen a dentist) and she said my teeth are healthy. No signs of cavities or any 'watches' (a tooth to keep an eye on)! Such a sigh of relief!!! This is probably due to a combination of prayers, a healthy diet, a different toothbrush (hard stiff bristles), and oil pulling. You do not understand how grateful I am!<br /><br />2 people I know used it once and did not like it. They rather use toothpaste. They felt the toothpowder doesn't clean their teeth as properly. Probably because there is no mint and could be a psychological thing because toothpaste, in my opinion, gives you an illusion that your mouth is clean due to the bubbles formed and the overpowering minty feeling (or whatever mix of strange ingredients it is).oothpaste.

B003OIK9OC|4|Okay, used only one time, the description could be a little more detailed I assumed the shade was brown shadow for brows.
B00GTAR7RE|5|Great product,fast shipping and my wife is very happy. Happy wife, happy life. Thanks for the great service.
B00BB5YHEI|5|This is the best Remington electric shaver I have used, and I've had several for over 40 years now.  It cuts very well and quickly regardless of one or multiple day growth being cut, recharges quickly, and cleans easily. I hope my next (when this eventually wears out) does as well.  Thanks.
B001L9D114|1|Oh boy! This thing does not work. Had to put it away within 72 hrs. We got the lady bug . The body fell apart . Of course it was till stuck on the mirror( suction cup is good) but with the top part falling out it's pretty much a chore to keep putting the brush inside and fix the top ... So don't waste your money..
B0000536P3|5|I was skeptical about Olay products.  I figured they spent a lot of money on advertising to get people to believe that their products actually worked.  But I'm 33 and my skin isn't exactly what it used to be so I went in search of some miracle creams.  I read all the reviews and tried this one out first.  Within a week I felt a noticeable difference in my skin.  It felt smoother and more moisturized.  After two weeks I swore I started seeing and feeling a difference.  My skin just felt tighter.  After a month, I was hooked - my skin tone was evening out and I couldn't have been happier. I've signed up for the subscribe and save with this product, delivering every two months.
B00BR3I7XQ|5|Fast Delivery. Good Product.
B008PWQQF8|4|I absolutely love my sonic express buddy! I have pretty sensitive skin, so I was a little warry about using it at first, but the brush has not been irritating to my skin at all! I even use it twice a day, morning and night. My skin is much smoother, which I noticed almost right away. I really like it becuase I can use it with my own face wash that I know works well for my skin already, and it has two speeds to choose from. You can also buy separate brush heads for more sensitive skin, or more acne prone skin.<br />I would for sure recommend this to anyone. I'm so happy that I bought mine!
B002EBX3V6|5|great
B000MS5M76|2|not heavy enough
B007W608N4|4|Good brushes but long waitt.
B00JB6ADA6|5|Very beautiful as pictured.  Wonderful gift idea.
B00150LT40|5|great price! works very well.
B001RK3Q5S|5|Love this toothpaste. Won't use any other brand.
B00J2G5JKY|5|I love the smell of the lavender!
B006WVCF1I|1|like many others who have reviewed this product on Amazon and other site, i have had the most horrible skin irritation and cystic acne breakout.  i have also tried to reach garnier with no luck.  Please dont put yourself through this. i have been suffering severe acne, irritation, cystic acne, and red blotchiness due to this product. my otherwise clear skin is severely compromised.<br /><br />Disappointed with Grenier that their customer service.
B00DH1O15O|1|I did not see any change in my skin.
B00NAIM3H2|2|Perhaps this is just a preference but I don't think I am a fan of towelettes. I am not a big person (5'4) and barely covered my body with 2! The color was ok but since it soaks in super fast, you need to make sure you get everything! Otherwise you become streaky like I did. It's nice that you don't need to keep rubbing it and waiting for it to dry but it doesn't show where it goes and you better make sure you get everything - fast! Wasn't happy with the results.
B001L1J1B6|5|this is the best brand of eyeliner ever. i can't believe anything else even sells. it's thick and creamy. waterproof. blends so easily.
B00QER6V4W|4|Lovely brushes, especially the eye blending brushes and the eye pencil brush. The brushes are very soft. One brush arrived bent unfortunately ( likely during shipping) but my dad was able to bed it back, you can't even tell! The green is nice and vibrant. These definitely stand out amongst other brushes, but in a good way. Overall, I am very happy I got these brushes. I am making great use of all the eye brushes.
B00ARAPTUY|1|They were entirely too large.  I was hoping for something about half that size.
B00BWNNBSC|5|What is not to love.  It's made of friendly materials and works well.  It's very natural feeling.  It doesn't get too sticky since it is water based.  It does dry up quickly if not in contact with other natural sources of lubrication, which does not make it ideal for anal play.  I'm not really into that, but sliquid makes a different product with more hold specifically for that purpose.
B00DZRRQMU|4|Got this to cover my grays when I wear a red wig that I bought for fun. I have dyed blonde hair.  Does the job for me.
B00HAMI454|5|I was looking for a small, lighted makeup mirror I could use for travel rather than lugging my 10&#34; square electric one. Most lighted mirrors have VERY feeble light with magnification between 5X to 10X that is simply too much. How could you possibly get the perspective needed to apply eye makeup tastefully?You would end up looking like a clown with 10X magnification! The lighted makeup mirror I use every day is nearly 20 years old and I don't know what I will do if it quits working. It has replaceable bulbs (which are also very hard to find), and the magnification is 2X on one side and flips over to no magnification. I would almost KILL to find another (just kidding), but I've looked for years and I'm convinced one just does not exist. This little mirror isn't perfect, but very close to it. I'm delighted and am anxious to use it for international travel!
B0014P8L9W|5|Great product. I saw results after my first use.
B00H8Z2LNY|5|I can really feel and see a reduction of wrinkles with this product!
B004K5JI2M|5|I bought these for my daughter and she loved them.  They were comfortable, soft, and gave her good support.  She had to walk to the bus and subway for work, and they were very helpful.
B000Y214EA|5|This is a great product!     In the reviews, there was somebody who was trying to find a certain smell.  I think what you are looking for is \\"Charleston\\". It's has smell of \\"Hyacinth, White Jasmine and Tuberose\\".
B006ZCQD30|5|started with the .5 mm. went to the 1mm.  still does not hurt. i think the longer one will work quicker. would recommend
B00O5DPKDU|5|It is amazing!!!!! I love it and will order it again.
B001G7QSEI|5|I will tell you why 5 Stars. Big Mama started using dentures (implants cost quite a bitsy tipsy more and she decided to give dentures a try) and one of the responsibilities associated with using dentures is to make sure they are constantly clean and free of germs. And in a nutshell that is exactly what this wonderful product does for the dentures! She takes them out of her lovely mouth at the end of a long day and they go directly into a see through thick glass (I think is an expensive whisky type glass) and    then I pour previously boiled water, now cooled down to room temperature, to about halfway on this good looking glass. Then, lo and behold, goes the Polident Overnight Double Action Denture Cleanser Tablets, 78-Count Boxes (Pack of 3) and it starts fizzling almost immediately and I cover the glass and sound the trumpet for everyone to hit the sack! Next day the weird looking dentures are inside this foamy whitish liquid that smells strongly of mint and I take them out, let them dry for a spell and Big Mama comes, hungry as ever for it is a new day, and puts the choppers on with the help of a wonderful paste we finally started using after several dismal failures where her dentures would dance on her mouth all day. So I give these wonderful alka seltzer type tablets a resounding 5 Stars for half the battle is won with flying colors each and every night! Go Go Go Polident Baybies, do your magic!
B003Z2GCH0|5|This is wonderful conditioner for dry, frizzy hair.  I have a lot of gray hair and Matrix Biolage is helping me to lose the cave woman look.
B0048KSGZO|5|Helps with runaway eyebrows quite well!
B00SABHLOE|5|LOVE LOVE LOVE Lady Gaga's Fame soap! Creamy, smooth lather that smells seductive & sexy!!
B0001TP05A|4|I had gotten a small sample jar years ago with some oil I bought. It recently ran out and I found it here on amazon. This stuff is a miracle cure for all kinds of aches, pains, and even bruises. I have used it on some bad bruises and it tremendously speeds up the healing time and takes away the pain. Great stuff. Buy it!
B00KXB0YTS|5|skin feels great --  ease of application -- odorless
B004BD8QEO|5|Great, my boyfriend love it.
B000Z8V358|5|Love these! I notice improvement mostly on the fast growth & strength of my nails, they're healthy and shiny; never will I ever get acrylic nails again. They've made start collecting nail polish! :D
B008TNPX52|3|These ended up being a clear full nail cover not a half nail. Not like described or how it looks in the picture.
B0043FRX6W|5|This product does a better job at covering gray than semi permanents I've used. Baka has a lasting effect and doesn't wash out as quick. I use clairol beautiful<br />collection semi permanents in between Baka treatments.  I get better coverage when the semi permanent is used on top of the Baka. This also cuts down on having to do a Baka every 4-6 weeks for 90 minutes.
B009D7V4WO|5|You cannot beat the price. It is beautiful in person. Came intact and as described! Love it. It shouldve bought more for gifts!
B0009OAGNI|5|Love it!
B0017U10SI|5|I love the way it makes you face feel. I also use it on my hands so they will feel as soft as my face.
B00HGIAA86|4|Smells Great came fast. I use it on my face, and my wife uses it on her pregnancy stretch marks.  I'll post in a few months about whether its worked to reduce my acne scars or her stretch marks.
B005V2UI9U|5|Delivered quickly. I use this for scent control in my kitchen, and it works beautifully. I put 10-12 drops in a 1-quart pan of water on my stove and simmer all evening, and the room smells like cinnamon, not the dinner I cooked. Love this!
B000PHLMAU|5|I already knew that I loved the Bed Head hairspray; I just needed something that would take up less room in my makeup bag. This size is perfect; just big enough to not run out so quickly, but small enough to take up less room and transport nicely.
B00BPN130M|5|Love this stuff. Delivered fast
B002JPJ2ZS|3|quick and as described
B003G5A60A|5|To rectify the poor hair dicisions I've recently made,  I have spent so much money on professional treatments and it was a waste! THIS, however, actually works. I use it up to 3-4 times a week (my hair is severely damaged up to the roots) and leave it in the 45 minutes......And it is so much cheaper on Amazon so don't buy it at a store!
B00ASEEUOU|4|My 1 year old baby likes to eat the tooth paste rather than let me brush her teeth with it.
B00MYIIWP6|3|Good but I don't like the way it shows up on my skin completion.
B00PR8K42Y|5|Bought the dupe for Mac 217. Love it.
B00J44U3IC|5|Exactly what I wanted.
B0054GYN30|5|I have been using this for a few years and able to find it on line so I keep ordering it!
B0045VI340|1|Doesn't work
B002HWS7UE|5|Like description. Good quality for a good price. I use it at home when I dye my hair and it protects me very well. The length is generous and the elastic/Velcro fit snugly around to keep hair off their necks.I was  tired of using a towel and be concerned about making mess around. Just perfect.
B0010JLCVG|5|Great for Bare Minerals Makeup.  I lost my original brush and decided to get a cheaper brush from the drug store.  Other reviews say that this brush sheds, every brush I tried sheds more then this.  This also seems to work better with the bare minerals makeup then the other brushes I tried.  I really like this brush and for the price, you cant beat it!
B003WN1ELQ|5|Item showed up when it was supposed to.  It came protected in a nifty bubble bag.<br /><br />Product Review: This product was referred to me by my dermatologist.  It's hard to find a moisturizer with over SPF 15 at a affordable price so I was happy to purchase this. It's  very light formula that isn't greasy (which is great because I have acne).  I have really sensitive skin that sometimes burns with some of the spf moisturizers that I've tried in the past.  This product does not give me that feeling.  It's make for sensitive skin.
B003NV9R2U|2|I should have listened to the reviews I read before I bought it because everyone said the same thing basically- doesn't even last through 1/2 day without having to re-apply more.
B005EM5RES|5|love it thank you
B00KNJOLSA|5|This is one of the best products I have tried. Defiantly recommend if your looking for something to control big pores and oily skin. I apply this 3 times a week all over my face and everyday on my T-zone to make my makeup look flawless. I noticed applying this on my nose and some on my forehead right before applying my makeup, makes and helps my face stay flawless the whole day. And make sure to wash it off good because it's a very thick product. With that being said this small jar can last about 5 months which is great for the price you get it for!
B00191R4QW|5|I purchased a bottle of the Passion Fruit Citrus lotion at the spa and love it. It makes my hands super soft and smells amazing. It is a little expensive but it's worth every penny!
B001063NY8|4|I actually love it, with one caveat.  I used it for cystic acne, and it worked wonderfully to bring down the swelling.  However, it did burn my skin.  I even used it with a carrier oil.  I'm really bummed because it did work so good on the acne.  I may have to try a different oil such as argan.  If you don't have sensitive skin, I do believe this would be a great product for you! The smell is very pleasant, though quite strong.  The price was exceptionally good, also.
B002RXK1UC|5|Great stuff, fast S&H and will buy again.
B00QAIV5VY|4|doesn't stay on all day, but I have trouble with that all the time.  I do love the smell and I take it with me so I can re apply
B002FCDC7Y|5|I was so happy to stumble upon this product. I don't like to use a lot of make-up and this replaces both base and power and provides a simple, smooth and non-greasy cover that makes my skin look and feel great!
B002HEW7Z8|5|This is a totally Amazing Seller!!! I recieved the next day (today) as paid for and I couldn't be more pleased!!! It's new and sealed and just perfect!!! Not to mention this product is off the charts crazy good :))  the best Bronzer on the market and saved over half buying it off Amazon!!! Highly, highly recommend this Seller & Deigner Skin's Black 20x Bronzing Body Silk!!!
B0007CXXYG|5|Awesome shampoo!!!
B000VPPUEA|5|My husband Guillermo  buys me all months this product spectacular , and economic. It's a miracle for those women who spent 35 years of age. You skin is moist, soft and smooth as porcelain and is withdrawn by little marks or stains that you get has to have. This product is fabulous.
B00EVVHVT2|5|I love DreadHead soap, it's unscented for those of us who are allergic/sensitive, cleans my dreads well, and definitely doesn't leave any residue.  It has a mild &#34;sharp&#34; scent (if you've ever taken a whiff of T-Sal, you'll recognize it), but nothing overpowering or lingering, it's gone by the time I rinse it out.  I hope I can continue to buy this soap for as long as I have dreads.
B00KKP0UBO|5|great product
B003V265QW|3|I thought this was going to be easy to use especially with the glove. the glove doesn't really help and my ends don't curl right...I have short hair and I am hoping once it grows out this will work better on my hair. also this gets extremely hot so be careful. I would buy a holder that suctions onto the mirror if you have small children.
B00763LZF8|5|Don't listen to other reviewers, if they were amy tighter it would rip out a tooth. Best to buy and it's an American company!
B00MNTELWE|5|I love this stuff!! So easy to apply and makes my skin look flawless. Well worth the money!
B000C1VWIQ|5|My review of Estee Lauder Youth Dew would be a simple, one word review:  PERFECTION.  However, Amazon requires more words.  I love this fragrance--thank goodness EL has not changed the formula.  It is timeless and even soothing.  I NEVER run out of Youth Dew.
B000GG7NU8|5|Does the job.  I put it on my eye lids
B001KYU2BW|1|I was trying to replace the Very Violet 514 eye shadow I had used in the past; I loved the colors.  I have been unable to find it in stores. I thought this was the same color as the original, but its not.  The colors of the shadows I received are not as subtle as the original; they are darker in shade and much for violet/purple in color.
B0023A7JF4|4|I have been using this soap for about 4 years now. The very first time anyone tries it, there will always be a burning sensation. Your skin has to get used to it for a couple of days. But the major problem is the fact that many people are using a cloth towel/ shower puff to apply the product. Never do that. I also made that mistake during the first couple of months of my use. I gave up on it because it seemed to make my acne worse. However after watching a youtube video about this soap, I learned that not using a cloth to apply the soap on you skin is key for the soap to work. Try using your hands instead (like I do). It really makes such a difference!
B00EI9TMXU|3|not bad
B002PBCAEQ|5|Wonderful product. It has a detachable applicator that works very well. This makes my face feel wonderful. I will continue to use this product.
B00112BS7K|5|I haven't wored it yet, but I tested it on my left hand and it blends in perfectly! I have been wearing loreal for years and I haven't had no problems with them. I stick to that name company since its popular and better than maybelle, cover girl, and others. The liquid is smooth and easy to put on. I normally buy the cool but I am trying the netural either one fits perfect asince it's the same shade. Ladies but this makeup to avoid heavy makeup on and get something that feels like your wearing no makeup.
B00K67AQNS|1|It's too small and I couldn't apply the foundation properly.
B00MS3KMNC|5|Yes yes I loooooooove it😍😍😘😘💘💘
B004AI9234|5|I have tried several other soaps and find this to produce the best lather. I does not make a slimy film as others do.
B006U98T08|5|I love this sets of makeup brushes. I was a bit skeptical about getting them but decided to when I read the reviews, and I would definitely recomend this for my friends.
B001P93MLE|5|This is the best sunblock I've ever found!  I have asthma that is triggered by scented products and the smell of typical sunscreens will cause an ashtma issue not to mention a terrible headache.  Of course I have to keep my 16 month old's skin protected and this stuff is perfect!!  I goes on smooth but doesn't stay greasey.  Best of all, there's NO ODOR!  None!  I wear it myself too!  My son and I both have sensative skin and neither one of us have broken out in a rash.  LOVE THIS STUFF!!
B005HR5ZGK|5|This moisturizer is wonderful for winter moisturizing.  The oil is not heavy nor is it sticky.  It's easily absorbed and leaves a nice dewy finish on my skin.  I continue to reorder because it's NOT full of chemicals and a little goes a long way to keep my skin healthy and hydrated!!!<br />LOVE IT!!!
B000FEF1V4|3|Sure the Trimmer has 9 different settings, but what they don't tell you is that you'll usually end up with a 2 every time unless you tape it down. What I mean is, when you're trimming with it, and press to hard, the settings will actually change. So even though I wanted a 5, I pressed too hard and ended up with a 4 and I was stuck with a 4 in a spot surrounded by 5.    From a 4 I was like shoot, now I gotta shave it all to make it even. Then when you're shaving to make it all an even 4, you accidently press too hard on one spot. OOPS!    Now I have three...and the cycle continues.    Other than that, no complaints really--just the vacuum doesn't pick up all the hairs.
B006I333X4|5|Love it!!!
B004QBC43A|1|Expired
B0079R6BD2|3|Waited since September 2014 to make a review: So far nothing has changed. My hair still falls out, it's dry as hell and it smells like potpourri or incense, which is kinda like a old smell that makes it look like I smoke.
B007GM1CBQ|3|Good product for the price. A bit thicker and darker than expected. But it does last the whole day with better coverage.
B00E6BQEEA|2|I'm 45, so I've been shaving for a few years.  On a whim, I thought I'd see what the fuss was about with this double edge safety razor resurgence.  In a word, the first shave was terrible.  I cut myself several times and had to go very slowly. It felt like the blade was about as sharp as my wife's disposable razor that's been in the shower for weeks.  The second shave (on the same blade) was even worse... guess you get one shave per blade with these VDH razors.<br /><br />I'll probably try a different manufacturer's blade, just to make sure I'm not missing something; but it appears this &#34;old technology&#34; was replaced with something better for a reason.  Honestly, I get a faster closer shave with a no-frills two-blade disposable.
B0043NIXXG|5|The Ben Nye AB-8 brush is the best cosmetic brush I have ever used to apply eye shadow or powder liner in precision lines.  I use a sparkly black-purple eyeshadow over my black eyeliner to soften it up, to create less contrast between it and my eyeshadow.  This brush applies the shadow in a line thinner than 1/16 of an inch.  I use this technique to apply darker eyeshadow on the line of my lower lashes instead of using pencil liner now.  This technique creates a longer-lasting line that is more natural.<br /><br />I would recommend this brush to anyone who uses brushes to apply cosmetics, whether he or she is creating a day look, an evening look, or a dramatic stage look.  This well-made brush can do it all.<br /><br />I would offer one piece of advice:  if you are going to apply a line of shadow or liner on the upper lid near the lash line, angle the brush in the makeup toward the side that initially does not make any sense to you.  Using my left hand, I angle the brush away from me when I draw it across the product in order to make sure most of the powder or liner will go closest to my lashes.  Of course, if you are a professional, you would say to me, &#34;Duh.&#34;  :)
B00NBCD7MW|5|I tried the Younique brand for my first fiber lash product, in comparison to that, I feel this is just as good.  I do notice fall out during the day but that could be my fault for applying too much.  Makes my lashes look super thick and long.  I love fiber lashes vs fake for daily wear.  It washes off easy and does not cause irritation - I have very sensitive eyes and this product is great for me. I would tell any of my friends to buy it!
B00FH692PQ|3|Dried out my hair.  Didn't see that it helped with loss or regrowth.  A tablespoon or two of evening primrose oil taken internally, every day, along with fresh, organic healthy food, multi-vitamins, lots of exercise and visualization is what worked best for me.  I would not buy this again.
B000KL1N3C|5|This product is wonderful.  It really crushes pills down to a fine powder.  I am glad that I bought it and will use it often.
B004Y99EO6|4|This looked super cute and I'm sure it would work just fine but I decided to send it back.
B0049424FM|5|This is the best drying drops.  I think they work better than the spray or the other drip dry drops.  Put these drops on and you can literally do anything you would do with nails that set for hours.  These drops are awesome!  What are you waiting for?  Order these!
B003EQ9V0W|3|I received the order in a timely manner and I loved the lip/blush cream that comes with it.<br />The only reason it's not a 5 is the actual product. It has a &#34;dry&#34; feel to it. Even after you have put your moisturizer it's hard to blend because of how dry it actually is.<br />Truly a shame.
B00GFAG1IE|5|I like this product so much!!! It really help to moisture your face!!!
B003RY4CO6|3|not an invasive smell its suttle, but you only need one squirt. smells like a calm vanilla-ish smell but not feminine. nice cheap cologne.
B00BC3YL2W|5|Smells amazing and makes my hair super soft!
B00K32VXTW|2|I did not like it, did not notice any difference in my skin at all
B00AV7PQ60|4|I've used this product for about 2 weeks thus far.  It's very hydrating and has a great texture.  I don't normally have dark circles or bags under my eyes, but I've had recent surgery and haven't been sleeping.  It's definitely reduced the puffiness and made me look more awake.  A little seems to go a long way.  I'm going to keep using this even when I begin to sleep normally again, because my sensitive skin seems to drink it in.  Since I don't have wrinkles under my eyes, I can't speak to that.  I would recommend this to someone looking for a new eye product.
B00KS6XWII|4|While I am not known for any extraordinary bravery, I took a \\"no guts, no glory\\" attitude when I first used this epilator:  dry, full speed, regular cap.  And I was very, very pleased with the results.  Hair-free legs!  It worked really well, and did not hurt, left just a mild tingly sensation.<br /><br />I was a little concerned when I first read all the warnings.  Among other things, don't use on suntanned skin (??) or baggy skin.  Hey, I'm old -- ALL my skin is baggy.<br /><br />I did use it on the unapproved knees, making sure the skin was tight, not loose, and had no issues.<br /><br />It took me an extra day to get the courage to try the underarm and bikini areas.  I've nicked myself under the arms before, and that hurts!  Getting the hair yanked out by the roots doesn't sound fun.  So I went with the gentle head, and lower setting, and used it wet and with shower gel as directed.  No problem, so I used the regular setting, still no problem.<br /><br />No bleeding and with hairless legs and pits, I got brave again and tried the wet use for the bikini line. Bikini link only, not anything more extreme -- that would ouch, I'd think.  Anyway, I was somewhat less pleased with neatening the bikini line.  There wasn't quite the demarcation line I'd wanted, and there were a few stragglers that the epilator didn't take care of.<br /><br />I used the exfoliator brush wet, with shower gel, and it was a nice, spa-like, pampered feel, not too rough or too gentle.  Not to be used on the face, per instructions, and it does seem like it would be too rough for that sensitive skin.<br /><br />The machine has a nice heavy feel to it, doesn't feel cheap.  It charges quite quickly.  The instructions say it takes an hour, but I think mine takes less that that for a full charge.  The heads snap in and out easily, and are easily cleaned.  There is even a little carrying pouch to put it all in, and a cleaning brush.  Altogether, a nice, well-thought out device.<br /><br />My to-be-removed hair is fairly light in color, fine, and relatively sparse.  Whether it would work as well on other types of hair, I don't know.<br /><br />This would be a 5-star product if I liked it better for bikini line cleanup, but as it is, it is a good, well-made 4-star epilator.oved hair is fairly light in color, fine, and relatively sparse.

B004UQ6Q62|5|i love it.
B00N9BHR1M|4|Product is excellent and is helping with the spots and discoloration on my daughter's skin from blemishes, without irritation.
B00IKTUB4S|5|This will take 'pinks' to a whole new level.  I love it!  Very fast shipping as well.
B00GMPD33I|4|Easiest way to  clean my floors.  Love it.
B000Y4357C|5|I've been wearing this cologne exclusively for years. I always get compliments and this was the best price I've gotten it for!
B00LDTSSVK|3|Too orange and it is not creamy enough. It feels like a crayon. I wish it was different. Not bad, but it is not the best product for me. I have sand skin stone.. Not the best product for me at least..
B0062IWQVU|5|Great Razor.  Worked great!  Razor and attachments were easy to use, easy to clean, and easy to store.  I have used many trimmers and razors in the past ut the Gillette Fusion Proglide 3-In-1 Styler is the best I ever used.
B002WN2Y8O|4|What to say about this?  The liquid is sort of a gross color I am not used to, but whatever, feels the same, works into a nice lather, but it smells like Suave.  If you like that smell, great.  If used in your hair you might want to add a conditioner after since this left it pretty dry and statically, vs my usual shampoo/conditioner product.  The scent is mild and the product works as advertised, so a nice solid body/hair wash.
B000P1TYF6|5|It is hard to believe that a simple product like Eucerin Spray can be so effective.  I use just a few spritzs every morning and the dry skin itch is gone for the day.
B001CG6C8U|5|Not only does this hydrate the lips, but it also keeps them moisturized for a very long time.  it makes a wonderful base for lipstick or lip gloss and keeps the colour fresher and vibrant for longer.  It is just a really great lip product all around.
B00NMWE25C|4|This Yuvaderm Phase 3 Moisturizer is recommended for Oily skin but can work on Normal skin too. This luxurious, high-end cream glides on the skin and leaves it smooth without a greasy feel. The fact it's also Paraben free and Gluten free is a bonus ! !
B0053T5UQW|2|This serum is the worst in my opinion. First of all i use the Clarisonic Mia to clean my face, then apply Premier Vitamin C & E Serum (awesome stuff) then i apply this estee Lauder serum which does leave blotches on my face also. It doesn't even out my skin tone & under my eyes seem darker like a raccoon. I'm in my 30's & caucasian. Personally i wouldn't buy this stuff if it was $20. DO NOT waster your money on this product, please find something better. Estee Lauder does have good products but NOT this one. The CP+R is awesome. Goodluck girls!!!
B000SBCZTK|4|I like this blush but my skin is a little too oily for it.  You may actually love it.  I just wasn't right for me.
B00HTBXR4Y|4|I'm 72 and have lots of wrinkles, but since I started using Strivectin a couple of years ago, my skin is more moist and younger looking.  I tried to switch to a high powered and more expensive cream and even with a long try, skin got worse, so I'm back to Strivectin
B0045U1YWE|4|Just as good as the Schick ST2 sensitive razors and cheaper per razor. Will purchase again for sure.
B005M1S68U|5|love this product. My skin welcomed the moisture that the emu oil gave. The price can't be beat. I will continue to order this product!!
B003Z4OD24|5|I've got very oily, acne prone, large-pored skin that is also sensitive and I'm very picky about exfoliating products. I've tried dozens of scrubs and only repurchased one, which is now discontinued. I finally decided to purchase this Acure scrub and I'm so glad I did! Not only is it an effective exfoliator, it works amazingly well at cutting down oiliness and I feel like I've just used a clay mask after using it. My skin looks much brighter and more even. I was worried I would be allergic to this since I have been allergic to so many organic skincare products with lots of plant ingredients in the past but I'm happy to report this didn't irritate my skin at all. Will definitely repurchase!
B000GBICYE|5|My wife and I love our new toothbrushes.  The timer is helpful so you know you have brushed them for the right period of time.  Also the brush head is the right size so you can reach every tooth, front and back.  My teeth have never felt this clean.  Plus I am using less toothpaste.
B000RH1TRE|1|This was the very first whitening product that I bought, and I definitely won't be purchasing it again. Most of the time, I couldn't even keep the tray in for the full 5 minutes because my teeth hurt so bad. I didn't notice any change in whiteness either, even after a week of using this twice a day. So take my advice, if you have sensitive teeth and want effective results, don't bother wasting your money on this.
B001QT3GVO|5|For the longest time I've been searching for something to replace my Sunsilk leave in shine conditioner. It used to be called thermasilk but they changed to sunsilk. They stopped selling it in 2008 and I have been scouring the internet for expired bottles (gross, i know but i was desperate) since then. This does the same thing but better, I couldnt believe it! It totally detangles my hair! I have long wavy (mostly from damage), dry, thick, tangly hair. It's always been that way since i was a kid. My mom used to try to comb out my hair and i would always fight her and cry. Even as an adult i would wake up to new tangles in my hair or if i wore my hair down by the end of the day tangles woud just develop and i would have to pull our chunks of my hair trying to comb them out. This is great. It makes your hair tangles free for days (I wash my hair twice a week). I typically comb my hair just once in the morning and once at night before bed and i never have tangles anymore. This just keeps detangling. And it is also moisturizing but doesnt weigh my hair down. For my wavy hair it keeps my waves together and not like a poofy, frizzy lion's mane. It makes it look like beachy waves. For once I look at my hair and think i'm lucky and instead of thinking it's a curse!
B005Y6MON6|5|Hubby likes it, no problems, works extremely well. No more 5 o clock shadow.
B0050HO9MI|4|I bought this as a starter razor, figuring if I liked double edged shaving, I'd move up to one of the fancy heavy ones later.  This does such a good job, I see no point in spending the extra cash.
B000052YM4|5|This cleanser has a lot of foam, after washing the face becomes slippery.
B001ET7KMC|5|I just started using this and really love how clean it makes my mouth feel
B00LU528WM|4|Quality product. Scent is good but not overpowering. Will be re-purchasing.
B004YKS3A6|3|I didn't like the \\"be curly\\" shampoo and conditioner at all. I thought the \\"dry remedy\\" worked on my hair much nicer. The curly shampoo didn't help my hair compared to the cheap off the shelf brands. The dry remedy gave it shine and decreased the frizz yet didn't take away the curl.
B000J3RG00|4|Like to use it to save to set my other concealer.
B00IO3U4LA|5|My mother used this and swears by it.
B0018BZ55A|5|Wow, I'm so glad that Amazon is carrying OPI products. They are the best! The French Manicure Kit is so great to have through out the year.  You can wear it anytime and do it yourself at home with the kit.  Great product and affordable!!
B001AL4DBA|5|Quality product, fast delivery
B00B96E8TI|5|This cream is very hydrating, and best of all there is NO scent. The texture is light and creamy. I use this at night, and when I wake up my skin still feels very soft, smooth, and moisturized. I also like that it comes in a clear, lightweight plastic jar, very easy to travel with.
B002ZG9742|5|This eye mask is very confortable and has a better adjustable fit than the blue one I purchased in a bath store at twice the price.  This has a wonderful Lavender scent and is nice and light weight and is very soothing and relaxing.
B00GTXHDHK|3|i had mixed feelings about this product. 1. because it was not in a case as pictured.. it was open and just placed in an envelope. that was kind of disturbing.. but I guess you get what you pay for. also the color I expected it to be was not it. I thought it would be a noticeable blue, it was more gray than anything which is not what I wanted. overall not really pleased, shipping and processing time was ok I guess but product overall, not great.
B000O7JK0A|5|I used it alone, there is no live lice found. But with nits. So I used it with the shampoo. it works very well.
B001VEK1HQ|5|What a difference in the shave!  The old one deteriorate so gradually that I didn't realize how degraded my shave had become.  I 'll replace the head yearly from now on.
B000NL0T1G|5|I just recently got into wetshaving thanks to the fine people at r/wickededge. This razor is well made and gives me a quality shave every time. If you're thinking about getting into wetshaving, you could do a lot worse than this guy for a first DE blade.
B0011DJICG|2|Smell is a bit too strong.
B0015G9EGY|5|OPI Expert Touch Lacquer Remover is wonderful, you don't have to use a lot and it remove the lacquer very easy.
B00158SEFO|2|wasn't worth the price
B0009F79EQ|4|I've been using this product instead of my sea salt soaks for about a week now and I really like it! It seems to be doing the job really well, my belly button piercing looks almost completely healed on the outside. I know it takes longer for the inside to heal but this seems to be doing its job well. I will continue to use this for the duration of my healing process :)
B002Q7JYRA|5|I have used this hairspray for years.  Every time I try something else I am always disappointed.  This provides the best hold but with a natural feel--no sticky hairspray feeling! I hate feeling product in my hair.  I just wish it wasn't so hard to find--most salons don't sell it.  The price can vary so I have to shop around online.  Great price through Amazon this time--it's usually more expensive here.
B00K58HQRM|2|I missed the dead line to return this product, however i wish i had never used it. I have a very sensitive skin, and this product caused extensive skin issues with a rash and weird spotting all over my face. Please be careful. This product is not for everyone and don't use it if you have sensitive skin. Further, it has a smell. Its a bit like milk and root beer. In short, try something else.
B007HEP0R0|2|I used the entire bottle 2x a day for 4-5 months and noticed nearly no difference what so ever , my skin just got a bit brighter
B0014P8L9W|5|omg love this in connection with this raw honey, vitamin c serum and rose water toner i am acne free ..in like forever  im soooo happy will be buying this product again
B001ABLKK2|4|Its ok. HHaven't seen big difference yet
B00343EMQI|5|I have been using this cream for almost 3 years, and believe me , it works, it works because i use it day by day.
B000VG7GDW|3|I got this for cold sores . I heard lemon balm works great for them. After going through 1 1/2 of these and a few cold sores- I'm relising it doesn't help to much. I will try something else next time.
B00343W79M|1|Murad was time consuming for a teenager to use. When you finished all the steps you were left with a clean face that smelled aweful. It has a nasty after smell that lingers for hours.
B001MA0QY2|5|I am happy with this purchase. It works well, and arrived swiftly. I would recommend it to others. It heats and cools quickly, and works better than other straighteners I've owned and used that cost nearly twice as much.
B003BLBLVC|1|i ordered two of this and only one came in the mail. they took 2 WEEKS for the other one to come, i had to email them a lot of times. then when i gifted this to my dad, this didnt smell at all! my dad has used this perfume forever and this is the first time i bought it online for mi. it doesnt smell at all. bad quality and service overall.
B00BQ2C1VW|1|This color is very nice, but too thick, very difficult too use, something is wrong, very different the other gelish  colors.
B00K1LYKUO|5|New skin care for me, love the product(s) and I would buy no place but Amazon,best prices.
B002ZNJI8K|5|My daughter loved it.  This was a Christmas.  She is 16 and has showed a interest in wanting to do hair, so this was perfect. She has flat ironed it and all!!!!!
B0001TQ9WI|5|This stuff loves my face and my face has never been happier! I have used it for over 20 years and still lovin it!
B0009R16O8|5|It Works well in doing the job. The smell is soft, it came on time and good price. I'll buy it again.
B00448JT4M|5|This smell is absolutely amazing. I am always getting complaments every time I wear it. The scent last a long time to.
B002XHHM3Q|4|I get complements all the time for this color and search the world for it.hate that they discontinued  it!
B005UXZN04|5|This size is worth the price! No where else have I been able to find this kind of bargain. It is the true perfume not a knock off.
B00006IVEN|1|so bad
B003QKH03Q|5|love the leppord print and the case has enough room for everything. The top is also removable. Awsome case. I love it
B0049KPS7C|1|I bought these bubbles because I was looking for something inexpensive that would provide good bubbles and scent. There was barely a scent detectable and the bubbles these provided in our sons bath were pathetic.
B00155PQ9O|5|I have long, bleached-blonde hair of medium thickness. I always use anti-frizz serums--Paul Mitchell's &#34;super skinny&#34; is my fav--and have tried many shampoos. Kerastase nutrient bain and Alterna cavier were my go-to's until I tried Alterna 10. This product is truly the best shampoo I have yet to come by. It is a vast improvement over Cavier; in that 10 gives my bleached, heat-styled and frizz-prone hair the most strength and resilience yet! Everyone's hair is different on account of ethnicity, age, gender, and treatment. If you have hair similar to what I have described, I highly recommend trying this product.
B00192LP02|5|I have very pale skin - not quite porcelain, but very.... Irish. It's a great colour for me, and I much prefer powder foundation to cream. My skin is - in addition to very pale - extremely sensitive, and breaks out for pretty much no reason. This brand looks natural on me and doesn't make me break out.
B005MPZLLG|2|I saw this on some beauty site that recommended the &#34;best&#34; products for curly hair. Well...I have very thick, curly, medium length hair, and this set is horrible. It smells VERY good, but I need to use like half the bottle of shampoo to get a good lather, and the conditioner doesn't do anything for my hair. I'm better off buying Herbal Essence or Pantene...
B001AMN194|5|Works fine.
B00DYZ7ZCO|4|Love this razor so far ... Use it to shave my bald head and it works great!
B000Q4QFX6|4|The product is fun to use & works as described in the instructions. I got it to use with my nieces & they love it.
B003QEX6VW|5|Really nice fit, good for on the floor without having to wear an apron.
B000NBNZXK|4|These emery boards serve the needed purpose and having them in different sizes was a plus for the price compared to the more popular brands.
B002OXSKF8|3|so, I dipped my dong in this stuff...cuz, you know, guys have to dip their dongs into pink things...it's, like, instinctual or something. Anyway, back to the point, now it looks like I took a pink hilighter to my little man. Talk about awkward, this stuff doesn't come off. Now it is like we are at a rave party, and I am supplying the neon glow stick!!! PARTY!!!!!
B00NSGDRSU|5|I love this case it came in way too early so that was a very good thing, i got the color pink because i think its the best color and i like how the pink really came out and how we can see thats a clearly an iPhone  6  i really like this case and im willing to buy another color
B007SNGSFS|5|This shaving system is AWESOME. It replaced my regular razor with the Braun shaver this refill goes to. I definitely recommend cleaning it after every use (with the push of a button). This is (as far as I know) the only way to clean the shaver, even so, it's worth every penny.
B004VGSVHS|5|one of the best brightening toothpastes on the market today!
B003U7BK5O|5|I love this shaver as it is nice, and smooth on your skin. It does not prick into your skin like other ones do. I will recommend it to family, and friends.
B000A3I2Z2|5|Love it...
B008HV3VU0|2|This mask smelled nice and had a nice consistancy, but it gave me a rash.  So I wouldn't recommend it.
B001BPJZIG|5|Passage to India!
B0041NXA9U|5|My mouth loves these while on the road.  It sings songs of joy, as I brush brush brush.  Very convienent on the go brushing.  Each brush is sealed.
B00BWUFAZ2|3|Not sure if it's the real deal or not was told they stopped making this lotion would love to know the answer plz
B000K7MDTO|3|I order two bottles Lather Bamboo Creme Moisturizer, 8-ounce bottles, the pumps on both bottles did not pump had to take pump caps off  and shake bottle upside to get the creme out.
B0029Y918M|3|This cushion provided significant relief for my butt when sitting for lengthy periods.  I am a computer programmer so I spend my days sitting in front of a computer. By mid-day, my butt was starting to hurt...until I bought this cushion! Now I can go through a whole day (with normal ups and downs) and feel comfortable at the end of the day.  Despite the 'no slide' backing, it still slides around on the (fabric) chair seat, so I have to adjust it a lot. Overall, recommended.
B003DLXABO|5|A man must have
B000WD5Z3C|4|I love this deodorant!! Smells nice and clean, not over powering like a lot of deodorant. This product is all natural, isn't tested on animals, and will not leave white residue on your clothes. I've used it for over a year and a half and will continue to use it.
B00QVXPDWK|5|I am so happy with the quality of these brushes!  They are soft and apply make-up smoothly and evenly.  In addition to the travel case, they were packaged in a nice quality box that I use to keep bracelets in now.  I've only used 1/2 of them so far and those 6 are well worth the price.  I consider the others a bonus!  Thanks Wanski!
B0039LMTBU|5|These razors are fantastic. I don't worry about getting cold right after I shave. I don't have to deal with razor burn anymore.<br />Will definitely be buying these in the future.
B007U90JC8|5|Love my shiny nails! My nails and polishes have never been as shiny as when I use Seche Vite Top Coat! It's easily the best and I've tried many!
B005HO0AR2|5|Well the neighbors haven't complained, my co-workers seem happy, my children aren't running away in fear, and even my wife snuggles up close.  I guess the soap is working cause I don't stink.  Dove is a great product that always delivers on its promise of getting you clean while being gentle to your skin!
B000052XZP|4|I see a lot of people reviewing the neutrogena t-gel shampoos...<br /><br />i recently got some and decided to just mix it IN with my regular shampoo !<br /><br />That way there is MUCH more foaming and cleansing and the smell of the t-gel is<br /><br />cut down quite a bit !  It IS a fantastic product for scalp itch & flaking !
B00IP42FBA|2|Not what I expected. Money could have been better spent.
B003LEXEDW|5|Excellent product. I wish I had started using it sooner. Everything it a was advertised to be. Easy to use.
B007E0FR84|4|Right on time, my hair was in danger of being cut off so that I could from scratch. First time I used it, I was pleased,
B008F5D4Y6|4|Really fun texture and it evens out my skin tone really well. It does make my dry patches more visible since I have very dry skin, but i can fix that by exfoliating and using a good moisturizer. I'm pretty pale so I got it in the first shade and it's a really good match :)
B006WBEGNI|5|They are perfect for the homemade Chapstick I make and look better than the pictures!
B0000DJEJP|4|good product ! I like.
B0054KG9CE|1|i contact the seller and this is their answer<br /><br />I see that u know each bottel is good to use for just 3 weeks u have to take 4 a day that is why I had to lested so cheap normally these if they had at least 1 year of life it would be $12 or more let me know if u have any questions<br /><br />That is bad because when i bought it didnt said that is cheap because of the expiration date, and their answer didnt look like a profesional customer service! bad  very bad
B007VB50LU|3|Not that great. Try something else if you have to shave chest/back regularly. I've had better results with less expensive.
B0018RESOS|4|Love this product, but this travel size is a deal breaker.  Put out a 32 oz pump bottle and I'll be back.  Otherwise it was nice using you, but I won't buy this teensy bottle again.
B00MH2QG3E|5|uncle harry's organic breath freshener - very good, strongness reduced with glycerin<br />Herb Pharm Herbal Breath Tonic Peppermint - no, far too strong,<br />oramd bottle- no , too difficult to get out the bottle because of a design flaw<br />california xtracts breath refresh - yes, sweetened to reduce the strongness<br /><br />oramd spray - yes, strong but effective<br /><br />every other breath spray - full of weird chemicals, including the one by Dr Mercola
B00EOB0042|5|This product smells amazing and its the best natural deodorant I've ever used!
B0087I6P9W|2|I'm not sure if BS has changed their formula, or if this was not authentic.  Normally it smells like fresh strawberries. This time it smelled like perfume with a hint of strawberry.  I threw it away.  Instant migraine trigger.
B004NW1M6C|1|I am generally a very easy person to please but the only nice thing that I can say about this product is that it comes in a pretty blue jar.<br />I really gave the Hydroxatone a very good try, I used it for four months every morning and evening, and this a summary of my results.  First of all this is a very greasy cream.  No matter how small an amount is applied, and how thin it is applied, it's just really greasy.<br />The second problem is that for me, it did not hydrate.  My skin felt dry about an hour after application, so when possible, I would reapply several times a  day.  My third major problem with this cream is that it stung my eyes.  Now the directions do state to &#34;keep away from eyes&#34;, so I would apply it well above my eyebrows, skip the bridge of my nose, skip any part of my face close to my eyes and just apply it lower down on my cheeks down toward my mouth, chin and jaw line, but somehow after 15 minutes or so my eyes would start to burn, and the crazy thing is that I do not have sensitive eyes.  I have used all sorts of eye lash serums, eye creams. face serums and moisturizers and I have never had a problem with burning eyes.  Any benefits from Hydroxatone...None At All.  As far a sunscreen, well SPF is only 15, which is nothing because you should use a minimum of 30.<br /> For me, one star is too good to rate this product.
B001MIN85S|4|it is working pretty well
B011MN75QA|5|Great product smells good keeps me dry all day without all the bad chemicals I would recommend this to all my friends and family
B001EJOPZC|5|a great body exfoliate...love these..sorry they are no longer available per subscription.
B002BAOMAG|3|I gave it a 3 star because I really like the smell and it really kept me from sweating but I broke out in a rash after about 2 weeks of use.
B00ISW92FG|5|A very good product.
B00354XMH6|5|Small compact. Maybe too small. But it works, when I can find it.
B005OSQGN8|5|I have tried countless \\"Fogless\\" mirrors and this is the best I've ever used!  Not only is the mirror area hug and, the light  super bright (& dimmable)....it actually stays fog free.  The mirror comes with a pivoting wall mount that is easy to hang with double faced tape & silicon glue.  Knock on wood, it has been up securely since Christmas Day.  There is also a good sized shelf with a built in squeegee.<br /><br />All you have to do is pull the mirror off the slide-in mount and fill the reservoir with warm water and it stays completely fog free!!  The warm water actually sits behind the mirrored surface and keeps the temp warm enough to completely eliminate the fog.  It really is the best shaving mirror I have found!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />I would strongly recommend to anyone!!!!!!!<br /><br />There are 2 small things I would suggest to the manufacturer - 1 is that it would be nice if there were 2 or 3 hooks under the shelf to hang razors, poofs, etc.  and 2 it would be great if the light automatically shut off after say 15 minutes as I have forgotten to turn it off several times.
B003M5UOBK|5|Shoulder length hair...leaves my hair shiny and non-frizzy.  A lot less flat iorning needed than usual.  Will continue buying this product.
B007M43GF8|5|Very easy to get a great look. Looked up some other looks and those were easy as well. Glad I found this item.
B007W18NXQ|5|An eye catcher in our bathroom, and has even &#34;shamed&#34; some folks into washing their hands! The soap is decent, doesnt smell too bad, though it is a bit drying.
B001VE6KJ4|4|I have been using this incense for about a year. Love the fragrance. This box smells a little different than last time I ordered from another seller. Not sure but seems to have a slightly sweeter smell. Still enjoy lighting it.
B0051AZBMQ|1|As a scrub freak I expected a considerable more from this product.<br /><br />You will not be as satiated as you would think after reading the product description.
B000NCTX6W|4|Great for winter feet and have even taken to using in my hands.  A small amount goes along way...great gift too
B00ATFJ8NQ|5|I will never use traditional shampoo again...AND...there r alot of imitators out there but none come close to Wen.  Worth the. money...skip take out..take care of your hair
B000EN5KDU|5|I've have use this product before ordering through Amazon and I just love it as a concealer under my makeup.  It hides any dark circles and small blemishes.  It goes a long way because it doesn't take much to cover the area.
B00DP1M6BW|4|This was suggested to me for migraines.  Be warned...upon opening, it smells VERY strong - you do not need to put it into your nose to smell it - just wave it under your nose a couple of inches away and you can't go wrong.  As for stopping migraines, it didn't work for me when I had a full-blown one, but, it did seem to take the edge off when I felt a couple trying to start.  At the very least, it smells pleasant (to me, at least) so it's nice to be able to smell it every once in a while just as a sort of migraine preventative.
B00T0UBVX6|5|I am loving exploring with oils for natural remedies! I received a bottle of goPure Naturals Fractionated Coconut Oil to review and there are so many uses out there! I have really loved using it to moisturize my dry skin while the weather has been so wacky. It also is great for mixing with essential oils for skin application and for aromotherapy. In using this, I found out about the antibacterial properties of the coconut oil and that mixing with certain antibacterial essential oils can create a natural wound treatment. I have been on a quest to eliminate harmful chemicals from our home and have been able to remove nearly all the cleaning products. Now with coconut oil I am working on the ways to eliminate beauty products and more that contain chemicals I can't even pronounce. This is working out great. I love fractionated coconut oil because it is so versatile as well as being odorless and colorless so when mixing with other oils, there is no weird scents.
B00H4EQQ3U|5|Bottles are the right size...came quickly, and are working well for my essential oil tooth brushing solution! They are great.
B00LNOV8JO|4|I've only been using my oil a few days,but love how it feels.
B00EB3CVCM|5|All of the 10 products are great.  I especially like the miracle silk conditioner and the conditioner with keratin.  I use the miracle silk conditioner on the top of my head and the conditioner with keratin on the ends.  The keratin is heavier and could weigh your hair down on top more than the silk conditioner.  I use the keratin on the ends because they usually need more conditioning (dead ends).  Works awesome!
B00L34C2IU|5|My niece, who attends many cosplay conventions tested this wig for me and made the following comments:<br /><br />The wig is high quality. The hair is soft and realistic looking, with multiple colors mixed together (which gives it a softer, more realistic look, as opposed to fibers that are all the same color). Fits very well and has plenty of room to expand or be pulled tighter, which is great if you have a lot of hair to pull up into it. Comes with a high-quality, sturdy wig cap made of a thicker woven material than the usual cheap nylon caps included with wigs. Once on, the wig stays in place well even during fast movement or while bending over.<br /><br />The hair itself is easy to move and pull back or around as needed. It can handle being brushed gently, with a minimum of hairs coming out during brushing, and holds the curls even after being brushed. The thick layering gives it a full look in the back, and allows for the bangs in front to be parted well without showing the base of the wig. The bangs can be parted anywhere and moved to either side without resisting being moved, but still stay where they are put without needing to be clipped or pinned back. The bangs are also long enough that they will still cover a higher or larger forehead.<br /><br />Where the bangs extend beyond the boundaries of the wig cap and brush against the sides of the face, they do get a bit itchy, but that happens with all synthetic fibers (I have never had any wig that isn't a tiny bit itchy). Because of the layering, some parts of the hair are shorter than others, which makes it look more realistic but also means a few short, stray curls sometimes stick out in the side or back. These can usually be tucked underneath other hairs or pinned into place, but might come out again during excessive movement.<br /><br />Overall, the quality of the wig is very nice. It looks good even after moving around and is comfortable enough for extended wear (beyond just an hour or two).<br /><br />This wig does not have a problem that lots of cosplayers have experienced with other wigs: it's very well balanced and doesn't tend to slip back (exposing the hairline and wig cap) while it's being worn. After an hour and a half or so, I only had to pull it forward once, and I think that was just because I had knocked it back while I was moving the bangs around.<br /><br />NOTE:  This website is currently experiencing problems with posting pictures, so I have included a link in the first comment beneath this review, showing three views of my niece wearing her new wig.<br /><br />***this wig was supplied by the manufacturer for testing and review purposes***of cosplayers have experienced with other wigs: it's very well balanced and doesn't tend to slip back (exposing the hairline and wig cap) while it's being worn.

B00GMP5BM4|4|One of the three sent was the Acetone version of this polish remover. The other two were the non-Acetone as ordered. Not a big deal.<br /><br />Fred
B0092BWWG8|5|generally, i love these lights...they are fun to play with and can be used in all sorts of games and recreational pursuits.  i am a bit unhappy will packaging, however, as i have made two purchases of this product and both times the product was folded over twice to fit in a box...a bend and curve which becomes nigh permanent in the fibers.  they should be packaged straight as many end up uses for hair design as the bends and curves cannot be control as readily as the straight fibers.
B0079R6BD2|5|I gave 5 stars because it feels good in my hair and on my scalp. My hair is thinker just after one use. Thank you.
B0126XBPS4|5|I loved this Crest Mouthwash because I was in search of a good mouthwash that contained fluoride and didn't make my mouth burn. I was so excited when I received this and it was perfect. It has a great taste, doesn't burn and is from a company I trust and am loyal to - Crest. You can trust this review because I am part of Shopper Army!
B008QTHCTY|5|Fast shipping! My God-daughter is very content! !
B00AINMFAC|5|Great shampoo.
B000G1MT2U|5|This is the only stuff that works for me! I've tried so tons of other products and this is the only one that leaves me hair soft and flexible not sticky at all!
B00192QCXC|5|Keeps my hair silver, not yellow. Very happy with the product, makes my hair more manageable. I will shop again.
B000C1ZA0C|5|My Oscar came perfectly packaged in its own box as shown. It also arrived earlier than expected. Definitely will be ordering this product again soon.<br />Thanks, Mariann
B00DQGZECE|5|I love these little travel perfume atomizer. Comes in handy when on the go. Would def repurchase again. :) thanks
B0067F28ZW|5|I love them very soft
B00BDOT1A2|5|Makes my hair very manageable and I love the fragrance! I absolutely would recommend it for anyone especially frizzy hair!
B00EVRX4SI|5|My wife really likes it, so I know I'll be ordering more when she needs/wants more. She says it is probable the best stuff she has used.
B002LZYVWA|5|Cruelty Free and Vegan, I love these wipes. They remove everything. I use these when I am feeling to lazy to wash my face. Super convenient, great product, and good price.
B000IN1D1O|5|I am a new user of Achipelago Botanicals and after buying my first product based on all the rave reviews on this site, I am now an ardent fan. Bought the gingered grapefruit and the scent is very subtle, yet substantial enough and everyone who has stepped into my room has commented on the wonderful scent. Some said it smells like an expensive 5 star hotel room!     It is really value for money compared to much more expensive reed diffusers from Europe. I am about to purchase more for the rest of my house and office!
B00D2MH66Y|5|Just fine.
B004SUHFI8|5|Try this you will not be disappointed.
B004ISU5V4|1|This treatment does NOT work! I'm so disappointed because I had a lot of hope in this product. I followed the directions exactly, washed my hair after 48 hours, but my hair is the exact same. After breathing in all those harsh chemicals, I was hoping this thing would work! Don't waste your moneyand time. It seriously did nothing.
B00MOKHJGM|5|Love it!
B0006ZEWEE|1|I have very dry skin, sometimes so dry that I put straight Jojoba oil on my face.  Basically what I’m saying is I need a heavy moisturizer.  However, this cream was even too heavy for me.  It clogged my pores and broke my skin out pretty back.<br />Another one bites the dust….a full bottle of night cream just wasted away.  There should be some kind of an exchange where woman can go and a swap out products that didn't work for them.
B000HQ0L2E|4|This works pretty well. It's still awkward to cut the hair on your own back but there's not way around that. This thing works. It always cuts the hair like it's suppose to, has a nice long arm, and it easy to wipe clean. It's a good buy.
B00K2O3NV2|5|Works great
B008J4C3QS|3|I like this eye mask, but it's nothing special.  It's basic and does the job.  It keeps light out pretty darn well, but it is really floppy.  Wish the portion that blocked light from around the nose wasn't so awkward, but it does the job.  The elastic could be a bit tighter.  Overall, I'd say it's decent.
B005PLQIQ4|5|My ever favourite.
B003TTDV1E|1|Much smaller than expected
B005C48ZL0|5|You don't need fakes with these -
B0013TMFV4|3|did not cut as well as other blades. I have bought. Tended to pull. Really bad if I do not shave every day.
B009L13OZ2|5|I kissed a lot of frogs to get here.  And by that, I mean that I ordered a lot of lip palettes to find &#34;the one&#34;. This is as close as I'm getting to &#34;The One&#34;.<br /><br />I wanted a lip palette for travel to avoid hauling a ton of lipstick with me and for a lower profile, compact-type item.  This item is a set of six beautifully pigmented colors of actual lipstick (not lip gloss or some other cleverly hidden term for lip gloss). The compact is about four inches by 2 inches (no, I didn't measure officially - just eyeballing it for reference).  It's a bit bigger than I would have preferred, however it has a great selection of colors. Because it's a lipstick, and not a lip gloss palette, I'm not panicked that it's going to melt all over my purse if the temp breaks 80F.  I haven't tried all the colors yet, but the ones I have tried have lasted a decent amount of time and apply smoothly and evenly.<br /><br />The case is sturdy and the clasp is tight.
B001E6OANC|2|I've been shaving my legs for over 20 years and my shave barely lasts 8 hours.  I have heard many complaints about the smell of depilatory creams previously but this one just smelled rather chemically with the aloe scent overlaying it and went away completely overnight.<br /><br />This was my first try using a depilatory and it worked ok for me.  I have rather sensitive skin and the instructions say the max is 10 minutes so I left it on about 7 minutes.  The hair wiped away as it should and left the skin fairly smooth but the dark root was very visible just under the skin and by the next day I had a stubble that needed shaving again.<br /><br />In general, depilatories just make me nervous though --- what if someone accidentally grabbed it and used it as shampoo or something?  Or if it was on my towel or hands after washing this off and then used it to wash or dry my hair after a shower (it takes some doing to get the goop off)? The results just weren't worth the extra worries.<br /><br />I think this would probably work for some people depending on the person and their hair so despite the two stars, each person probably has to just try it out for themselves at least once.  The upside is that this is very affordable to try.
B0041VD78Q|5|I recommend all South of France products. They lather well, smell great, and make my skin feel sooo soft. I sometimes use it as a body wash too, and it's wonderful.
B00LWLIQJI|4|It's good
B001FS0HAY|1|too much magnification, had to put nose next to mirror too focus. couldn't see face in mirror. certainly not a makeup mirror,
B00CD24NQ0|5|These are great picks with floss and scraper.  Best on the market.
B003DS9BTC|5|Had difficulty creating a good lather with my cheapie boar brush. The Omega 49 creates heaps of lather in a very short time. Liked it so much, bought a 48, too.
B000O3VRTQ|5|I have been buying this for some time now. It really helps to make your mouth feel fresh and clean.
B0034F9K36|3|Great lotion but bottle was damaged upon arrival, squirt pump never worked. Recommend the lotion though.
B009BLBCW4|5|My husband first tried it in the 70tys and he has the best hair.  Kaminomoto is the same now as it was then.  Great!
B000G7XY0A|5|The shower chair is perfect, especially how the legs adjust.  They are easy to move and no pinched fingers.
B00N30SE3E|5|Great
B0050X0RO6|5|My favorite..........so glad I found it.  Used the last one down to the metal.  Love Loreal products.  Thanks for supplying it.
B00BDJT1CU|1|Broke within a few weeks. This was a big waste of money.
B004W9WJL8|5|What can I say? This product which is hard to find a sales rep from Mary Kay who sells it still is just perfect for the lady that names it as her perfume. Recieved without issues and was a great gift to my lady.
B00BSE4DA0|4|I loved this product and I love foam coloring my hair. I find foam to be a little less messy in my opinion and I always find a way to stain my entire house with regular coloring products. While it does tend to get on your face and ears a little more, &#34;color removes color&#34;. It simply washes off if you rub your colored hair on those areas in the shower. That's what my hair dresser taught me years ago and it always works. This color turned out great and I plan to continue to use it. I got loads of compliments from friends, family, co-workers and strangers a like. Love love love this product
B00908XVWC|3|I love the color combinations of this palette and had high hopes because I love most of BH cosmetic eyeshadow palettes.  The quality and feel to these shadows is inconsistent between colors and finishes.  Some are extremely pigmented, others not so much.  Some of the lighter colors have too much glitter for my taste and tend to have fall-out. If you don't mind fall-out and love color and glitter, this might be a good palette for some considering the price point.  As compared to BH 88 and 120-color palettes, the quality just didn't seem as good. You can get BH products for a decent price on Amazon with Prime membership due to the free shipping.  However, if you order $50 of product from BH directly, they often have great sales where you can get a lot more product for the money if buying several items.
B0056GDG90|4|After reading the reviews I decided to give this a try.  I must say that it's taken me several tries to get the hang of it.  I do like it though and think that the more comfortable I get, the more I'll like it.
B0079R6BD2|5|Love the way it leaves my hair
B001BO0KMC|5|i already had one, but bought one for a girlfriend as well. These are fabulous if you have<br />curl in your hair and wish to tame them a bit. Another helpful hint: use PRODUCT to fight<br />frizzies/humidity...js
B002JPJ2ZS|5|After finding out severe anemia was causing hair loss I found this product and have been taking it for almost a year.  After about two weeks on this I started to notice a LOT of baby hairs growing back!  At about 4 weeks my hair stylist asked me if I was doing something different because she couldnt believe the amount of new hair I had!  Ive been a faithful user and my hair is now back to its long and thick norm!
B002D0D4VM|4|After learning a out Blemish Balm (BB)...how it can gives you a flawless look while enriching your skin...  I bought this product' ecause it is known to be the lightest and it is!  It's great for some one who only needs a little coverage.  I am moving on to the next level of coverage in BB.
B0017K8HJS|5|Fast shipping! Excellent product!, I looove it. I have relaxed hair and  a short hair cut. I use it on my sides to hold them in place as well as the top when curling or flatironing. This stuff is awesome. My daughter used it on her naturally curly hair and loves it as well. Plus the price was cheaper then in the store. I WILL be ordering another.
B00IPVCCVQ|5|I love all of them. My hair looks so shiny and healthy since I started using the shampoo bars. I really like the sampling, because now I know what bars I want to buy.
B003V265QW|3|Ok, but not for my hair...thinish.  It seems to ruin my hair.
B001286ADA|3|It is better in another recipient. But I like it.
B00EB05ITI|5|great
B006W2SYF8|4|Works fine but not as good as blade shave. But I like the convenience of cleaning my face in a hurry.
B00OQAVF6I|5|Creme concealer stick.  I bought this because I wanted great coverage that is compact and mobile for last minute touch-ups.  During the application, the stick slides over my skin like velvet and the blending is flawless.  Great for that &#34;I haven't slept in days&#34; face with the dark circles and works wonders for acne scarring imperfections.  I have used it both with and without foundation and I felt like I had the same coverage either way.  And it didn't make my face feel heavy from wearing it in conjunction with my liquid foundation or irritate my skin.  A really great product, will order again.
B00U9S6TTY|5|This is a QUALITY essential oil, and lots of it! You can immediately tell the difference with this oil, and some others I have purchased in the past. I use this in a diffuser, or add some drops in a warm tub for immediate relaxation. Would love to try some of this companies other oils!
B0009OAHQE|5|It's my  fav, I just love it, I just smell like a goddess
B001TVP84C|3|It takes several times to apply and cover the area.
B000RH1T10|3|Qualitty is good, but I dislike the fact that you have to insuflate the cushion. I will recomended for teatcher for CPR. Delivery time is pretty good.
B008J54PQ8|5|Other than being absolutely adorable, this works like none other! It puts all the other powders I've tried to shame. I'm a customer for life.
B004RH8ZIG|5|I am a heavy sweater and have tried just about every type of deodorant out there; this is by far the best I have ever used. In fact, I have gotten almost all of my family and friends using it, and they swear by it. I especially like this scent....and I've tried several.
B0014PCV48|5|These tweezers are perfect! They grab the tiniest hairs. I had been searching for a new pair because my old ones got bent somehow. I looked at Sephora since that's where I do my make-up shopping but all their tweezers cost $20!!! Which is absolutely outrageous. So my next course of action was to look here. I happened across this brand and saw all the great reviews and what's more is that these only cost a couple dollars WITH shipping! So now I have a great pair of tweezers that should last me many more years to come. Final verdict, these are a MUST buy if you are diy tweezer!!
B003V21WO2|5|EXCELENTE
B002X1RNEU|5|The Organic Raw Apricot Kernels are great and as advertised.  They are being used to help my metabolism system.  I'\ve ben taking them a couple weeks now.  Great so far.<br />Lost 10 pounds first month; have helped lose belly fat in three months.  So yes, great.
B004INUWX0|5|Exactly as described! Love this product!
B00014DKRU|4|Feels good, relaxes muscles.
B003NVR4HA|5|This deodorant works very well. Even tough it's a bit small, it lasts for awhile. This deodorant doesn't leave a caked on armpit stains on shirts. It also smells fresh all day.
B001PPMLS8|5|This product is great for your hair. My hair is so much better after using this oil. This oil has a nice smell.
B00B1GBJTS|5|I love the application of this product.  Great staying power and I love the matte finish. Has a classic look.
B008EMQL40|5|Great product
B008RTNSJQ|5|Hi I do my own nails and clippers are not that great...these cut nice and smooth ;) would buy again
B000FP63M4|5|I figured $6.00 vs. a new razor I would try the replacement myself. Armed with the detailed \\"how to\\" from J. Muir, I ordered my batteries, got out my son's old soldering iron and once they arrived discharged my shaver's original battery and opened the case. Both the old and new batteries were in sets of two already glued together and soldered by a strip at their bases. The most important and difficult part was using a screwdriver and long nose pliars to carefully pry off the strips of soldered metal that goes down into the battery circuit board from the head of the old battery pack. I straightened them so that I could solder the strips from the new batteries to the strips remaining from the old. The soldering part scared me because of my inexperience. I found that with the old strips standing straight up I could bend the new strips straight down to stick them in front of the old--making pretty firm contact.<br /><br />I decided to skip the soldering, thought briefly about wire glue, and went ahead with this experiment that I could revisit if need be. With the new strips pushed in front of the old my plug in/time dial lit up, so I used a piece of duct tape to make the batteries in the battery holder in the shaver more secure from jiggling. I closed it, recharged it, and have been using it for over a week (and with this current edit for over two years without a problem).<br /><br />Does anyone ever use duct tape on ducts?
B0081NLR8M|4|Great price! Quick delivery.  I am a big Regenerist fan, this particular cream seems to be doing the trick except not so much witih the age spot.
B007MF8846|5|Love this stuff..
B00JRCFKR0|4|Got it on time. The product is not as good as I thought it would be.
B000ZMAL2U|5|best ever
B00FTC6ZBM|1|described as coconut smell, no... more like rubbing alcohol
B00C8A2NHS|3|I purchased this soap because I had heard that Arko produces a thick, rich lather, even with hard water. Unfortunately, I have not found that to be the case. With my relatively hard tap water, Arko does not lather noticeably better than any other hard shaving soap I have used.
B000HF4PE0|5|this thing really does work. follow the directions and before you know it you've got your socks on. very happy with this purchase.
B00IJQDZTU|4|Great alternative to the expensive Younique product.  However, the multiple steps required in applying this product can be tedious.
B001E0C9LI|5|i bought it as a present for my boyfriend and it works great! it leaves a very close shave when needed, making anything nice and smooth.... or not if you dont want it that way
B00005JS56|1|This unit does not shave well dry or wet and is in the process of being returned. It is not recommended for purchase. I bought it for wife's Christmas and regret the selection.
B001MA0QY2|5|Works great!
B003JBABEW|5|Great gum. Best flavor retention. Hard to find.
B00PKXHWEY|3|Didn't like it a lot
B00PPY5KP6|5|Absolutely safe<br />I have a very sensitive skin that develops rashes frequently…but with these tissues I have no such worries since they not only cleanse the face but nourishes it too…
B001E77NEO|1|Rubberized ribbon a nuisance and hurts
B002QFGQAK|2|I was excited when i received this concealer palette but when i opened it, the concealers were all mixed together. I considered returning it but decided to keep it.
B002676C5C|4|The hospital gave it to me to improve certain areas of my burn injury, and it seems to soften the skin or even flatten the grafted area.  It's apparently not for all areas.  It's worth the money, to me.  Reusable & seems to last longer than the manufacturer says.
B003IMGVEQ|5|I love the Konad Stamping Nail Art!! This was my first time using them, and this will be the best way for a newbie to start using konad. It comes with one design plate, two small konad nail polishes (white / Black) and the stamper and scraper. At the beginning I was trying to use the design plate with other polishes to avoid having to buy the konad brand since they are kind of expensive, but sadly I had to find out that not all of the non-konad nail polisher's work on the plates or Stamper. Needless to say I also order a couple more [[ASIN:B000KPVB3K Konad Stamping Nail Art Special Polish 10/10 Ml for Nail Art Design]]. Overall I think that for a newbie like me this is a great way to learn how to use konad stamp system and to get the hang of it, so I totally recommend the kit.
B0006PKGJY|5|Love this cream. Has made a noticeable difference on my skin. Even hubby noticed ! Makes skin silky soft.using it on neck and arms too because I love it so much
B007H0S7VK|4|I dont' use tanning booths very often; just in the winter 3-4 times due to a skin condition that flares up from lack of sun.  Kept skin moist.
B00KCFAZTE|5|First use I noticed a difference!
B00G5L867C|4|Philips Sonicare Rechargeable Toothbrush for Kids has pros and cons as all products to. The toothbrush head itself is just the right size for smaller mouths while the handle isn’t as child user friendly. In my eyes this is perfect for children a little older in age – 10 and up. If there’s an adult around to help I think it would work out fine, but in a way that kind of takes away from the whole idea of using this electronic toothbrush as a way to get kids into brushing their teeth more.<br /><br />The interchangeable stickers are great and makes for perfect personalization if you have more than one child. Another plus is the timer letting the child know when they are finished. Getting used to an electronic toothbrush vs. a regular brush takes a bit of time, but it’s all about the novelty for kids which in turn should easily make this fun to do.<br /><br />All in all we’re so far impressed and liking the way this toothbrush is working. I have plans to purchase additional units for other younger family members in the future.
B002YZ6UF8|5|Everything case so fast and unexpected but it was damaged but not badly as in spilling! But it was great
B005FGQ2QK|1|Smaller than expected
B000KOI3KU|5|I USE THIS BEFORE AND I WAS SO HAPPY TO HAVE FIND IT ON AMAZON.  IT'S WORTH IT. MY HIGHLIGHTS COME OUT JUST THE WAY I WANT IT. NOT TOO MESSY.  TRY IT LADIES !
B0070O69RW|5|a super compact to have with mineral powders. works well. i have a couple of them. get one for yourself!
B001CT053U|3|I prefer regular curve.
B005FD707S|5|I'm a lifelong customer of this stuff.  Makes your face feel so smooth and you can use it everyday.  I never run out of this stuff.
B002GTR902|5|this is a great machine, the second one I have bought.... I purchased the first one three and a half years ago when my grand son was born... It ran every night and sometimes all day without a problem... the old one still worked, but wouldn't start every time; because of a flat spot on the armature...
B00PUYEQLA|2|I have used this for almost 2 weeks every night. And every morning, not able to tell much of a difference  for the day, the only noticeable difference is immediately after it is applied, seems to tighten the skin like an egg white would for a lot less money
B00TTCZHWG|5|Great gift for kids and teenagers! My nieces love it.
B005FAADDO|5|This gel smells amazing and leaves my skin so soft.  A La Maison products are high quality and have not disappointed me in any way.
B000VON3BS|5|I love it
B0030KCMT4|4|I received this lip gloss as a BzzAgent. I really like it! The color is nice. The shine is just right. It doesn't last that long, but it's also not overly sticky like other lip glosses that last longer. It has a good smell and flavor. I'm not certain that I would pay $7 for it, but I do really like it.
B0083RK2QE|5|This review is way overdue. I brought this a few months ago for a anime convention in town. The wig I ordered was in good quality except of the wig cap. The wig cap was different which wasn't a huge problem. I chose to wear my everyday wig cap. It was a easy replacement. The wig was packed very well. The shipment took less than a week. 5/5
B0089GBCEK|2|No happy with this set.  The case is already falling a part and the clippers are not very sharp and don't make a clean cut.
B000L596FE|5|My daughter has very curly hair and would be knotted very easily. She hated to brush her hair until she got this brush. Now when her hair is wet it is very easy for her, and she finds that even when it is dry, it is much easier to brush than with other brushes. We even bought a second one so she could have one upstairs and downstairs.
B000BF3VBY|3|Never used before but used the no rinse shampoo by the same company. I guess it will work well like the other items I bought and used before.  Used other companies like this but some have stuff in it I did not like on my body.
B004Z40048|3|The were way too long for my eyes, so I had to cut them, but then they were fine, and they r totally worth the super cheap price.
B00H292M94|1|Purchased this, and it lasted for 5 uses.  I contacted the company.  They had me upload a video...the machine  was completely dead...no lights or noise.  Ultimately they told me that I could find a repair facility, and they would reimburse me.  No one in the city that I live wanted to touch it.
B00EOP3MJI|5|I really liked this sunscreen. I'm sensitive to a lot of sunscreen ingredients, but I didn't have any issues with this one at all.<br /><br />It went on smoothly and provided good coverage. It has a nice, cologne-type smell to it. But a woman could easily use this as well, as the smell is not strong and dissipates quickly.<br /><br />After applied it soaked in quickly and wasn't greasy. I wore it all afternoon in the hot sun and didn't have any sunburn.<br /><br />I've used it on my face and have not had any breakouts, like other susncreens give me.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00DTTYF6E|4|It is a very good moisturizer, I like to put it on my hand as well. I wash my hand to many times everyday, this really helps to keep my skin soft. When using on the face, the only down side is that it is too oily, however the oily feeling goes away really quick, like 30 sec after putting it on, the skin absorbed most of it.
B00E689VXE|2|This formula isn't &#34;ash&#34; it has very strong red tones, I wouldn't use it on brown, grey hair.  If so, you will have to use a toner (blue and/or yellow or green) to reduce the red.
B00FOGKPAK|4|Smells like beer which is awesome! This is definitely a soap for men as it should be.
B004IF1K66|2|I like the triple strength wrinkle smoother better. I didn't notice any results with one jar. I'm going back to the triple strength.
B004R7LE7A|5|This is my favorite lipstick to use with other lipstick colors.  I love the gold sheen that it provides and have had many women ask me where I purchased it.
B001W2IVKQ|5|A &#34;must have&#34; for finishing shine and a sleek polished look that is never oily or weighed down. STOCK UP!!!
B00DPE9EQO|5|The best vitamin C out there, can not love without the stuff!
B00MUBZN5E|3|Okay, the skull falls off constantly.
B005TT8S74|5|This is the only Al Rehab oil I seem to like. If I were to describe this.... lighting a citrus candle in a tea shop and then sniffing a baby with sure deodorant on his cheek. lol just buy it.
B00AHF1GTM|5|The Schick Hyrdo Silk Disposable Razor performs like no other disposable razor.  It performs like a non-disposible in that the quality of the handle is made with little details that enable you to hold on to the razor once you start shaving.  The razor head is movable thus enabling a close shave with out cuts i.e. most important around the knees!  Then there is the actual razor that has 5 razor blades and moisture strips giving you the most softest and closest shave you can get - disposable and non-disposible wise. (Disclaimer: I was able to try this razor free from Schick).
B000GFWIOU|5|No problems. I would purchase from the seller again.
B001I90NV8|5|I love this toothpaste so much.  I never like to use any other toothpaste as others just pale in comparison.  It keeps the mouth and breath fresh for hours, which other natural toothpastes often fall short on.  It is a vegan product with gentle ingredients.  I have even used this paste with my 2 year old son as it is floride free, and it is gentle enough even for him.
B00D9NV2D4|5|This is the real thing! Nice ivory color. Soft consistancy. Love how it's packaged. Very pleased with my purchase. I would definitely buy from this supplier again. Please don't be fooled by those buyers selling shea for dirt cheap. This shea butter is wonderful!
B002TNK7ZY|5|good product
B000SOMZOW|5|This is the perfect sleep mask. Very light and thin. Not bulky at all like some masks are but still completely shuts out the light.
B002JPJ2ZS|5|I'm usually not one to leave rave reviews, but this product is pretty amazing. I had my haircolor refreshed and one week later had new growth showing. Seeing as my hairdresser ordered her own box the next day, that pretty much tells you how impressed she was by my results.
B000GFGIIM|2|I was very disappointed with this purchase.  I was looking for the palm oil cakes in white and handle-able.  These cakes are huge, not white - not at all what was   pictured.  I would not send them back because of the ridiculous postage prices.
B009YSTOE2|2|This produced darkened my gray hairs but they were golden colored and bronze colored. You must use henna and not just indigo to get your hair dark.
B00ADRGWNE|5|Perfect. I started using the entire product line of the OGX Keratin Oil about 8 months ago to fix my breaking, falling out, damaged hair. It has worked miracles. My hair is noticably stronger, more supple, and more shiny. And it is no longer falling out.
B004TSF8R4|5|Great brush and will buy again
B001AMQJ84|5|i have fine hair...this makes it super soft and it feels thick and strong...i will continue using...definitely worth the $$$....i'm in love :)
B0002M5JO8|4|After struggling to find the replacement heads locally, I finally turned to Amazon to find what I was looking for. The items arrived very quickly and in great shape. The price was very good compared to Oral B's own website (almost double the price) and shipping was free at Amazon.
B0009S9WO8|5|These Clippers are Very Good For Just $9 Dollars I Mean They Cut Even and Straight and Smooth It Took Me Only 5 mins To Cut My Cousin Hair And He Had A Afro
B00ITXF44C|3|I like using oil on my hair and skin so I ordered this because of the reviews, but it is a little too heavy for my skin and hair. This oil is very costly and not as good as the apricot oil. I would not buy it again.
B0009R358S|5|I really like it.
B008P7HQ2K|5|Love it
B008RX06DS|5|I have natural Black Girl hair that I bleached platinum blond.  The Shampoo is great.  Shampoo doesn't dry out hair.  It's has no Sulfates or harsh chemicals so washing is creamy and cleansing without the drying out effect.  This is the only thing that returns my hair strong and silky soft to the touch. The  FX Wild Harvest Hair Curls Up Serum/Cream, Dandelion is the best leave in conditioner EVER.  It leaves your hair silky soft and strong.  It gets confused with a knock off name FX in a orangy bottle.  It IS NOT the SAME!
B00700RRSG|5|Is a Lovely fragance, is not an escandalous smell,  is a serenity wood fresh perfume. Tous know what they do
B00J54KD7M|3|It doesn't curl as well without mascara
B000TD50TY|4|My older sister got me into this stuff. Amazing. Best tanning lotion ever. It smells okay, but when you apply it make sure to exfoliate BEFORE tanning and rub in well. I like to take some baby wipes with me to wipe my hands off as the bronzers in this get orange like self tanner on your hands. Avoid your face, stay dry mext few hours and you're golden.. Literally:)
B003M57E9A|2|I first bought this product 2 years ago and it was amazing. The last 2 bottles have been totally different, soap is like Black gritty water, doesn't lather and sprays out of the bottle when I try and pump it into my hand. No way it would make a mask. If I try and shake it up to try and see if the ingredients have separated it comes out of the top of the botte where the pump joins and makes a mess and wastes the soap. I'm really disappointed because the first bottle was miraculous.
B0043OYFKU|5|Good
B0052UWIXK|5|I am hooked on water based polish, which I think is a great invention and a fantastic alternative to stinky, toxic solvent-based polish.<br /><br />I have had great success using Scotch Naturals sticky base & top coat with various brands of water-based polish--it works great with Cosmay, a new brand on the market with an outstanding selection of bold colors.<br /><br />There is definitely a trick or two to succeeding with water-based polishes: I've been using them for some months now but I had to get the swing of things at first.<br /><br />1. I have learned that nails must be absolutely free from any kind of greasy or oily residue: squeaky clean.<br />2. I get best results when I smooth, buff and polish my nails before polish. Remove all dust.<br />3. Use Scotch Naturals sticky base & top coat. Don't expect the sticky base to dry: it won't.<br />4. Definitely give nails at least 6 hours dry after painting: you will have a mess on your hands if you shower before the polish is cured.
B009GIOVKW|5|Great product worth the money I bought a second one for my wife so she could stop using mine.
B001CF2A4Q|5|This product does work - within a couple weeks I saw a definite difference.  I will continue to purchase this product!
B00336EUTK|2|I was so excited to try this product but I guess it didn't work for me. I followed the directions and used a strip 30mins a day. After about 10 strips, I was a bit skeptical because I saw very little to no change at all. I have now used up almost all of the strips, with one or two unused, and still do not see much result. ):
B000ZJ2842|5|Love Vanicream Sunscreens: absolutely nothing in it to bother skin, while still getting protection. Non-greasy.
B007TNPR04|5|Love Mr. Pumice! A good friend showed me these a few years back and my feet have never looked as good! They are great to use between pedicures to keep your feet from looking dry and getting cracked and they are a must for everyone (man and woman) during the summer months when everyone gets their sandals and flip flops out! I would and do recommend these to everyone! They work great and don't hurt your feet like the hard pumice rocks. My pretty feet are the proof thanks Mr. Pumice!!
B003WPN7E6|5|I want to change the shipping adress and the fullname
B000I5HJ2Y|5|Excellent! Very Good seller
B004ID39I0|5|I bought this because I read a break down of mascara that named this one of the most affordable products with the least carcinogenic or harmful chemicals.  Frankly, I figured it might be crap, but was work a try.  I love the super fine brush (cone shaped), and I feel like I get a great effect on my lashes.  Thumbs up!
B00COCY1ES|5|I love this pillow.  I purchased one years ago and needed to replace it.  Could not find one in brick and mortar stores anywhere and found it on Amazon. I was thrilled.  I look forward to my spa baths in comfort again!
B00GW1HKHW|5|It looks weird at the first time. But, technically it works for me. Recommended.
B0034G90CQ|5|Great product that never causes breakouts!!
B0012JY4G4|4|I took a star off because I really expected this to work on Kool Aid dyed hair. It does not. We dipped both of our daughter's hair in cherry Kool Aid. 6 months later....it's still there. We ended up using a regular hair color to color over it, it toned it down a lot but you can tell it is still there. Live and learn.
B001UP6IB4|5|This shampoo is not only good for your hair but also has a delicious  smell.  I first learned of it at a spa and was very happy to see that I could get it through Amazon.
B005FYE534|5|Due to the low selling price of these pliers, I wasn't sure that I was going to get a decent set of pliers. But when I pulled em out of the envelope, I was impressed. They have a decent weight to them, and fit my hand great. I wear 7/16'' silicone &#34;skins&#34; with 8g captive ball rings run thru them. The 8s aren't too bad, but anything bigger might be tough. If youre easy with them, you wont need closing pliers to reclose the rings. I love these pliers more than those with the rubber covers on the opening end personally.
B000BBS636|5|Conair YB075W Pro Yellowbird is really most excellent. This hair dryer is sturdy and well built. Definitely worth the money.
B00EUWJ596|5|I was suggested this item by one of my girlfriends. From the moment she pulled it out of her purse I knew I needed it and ended up ordering it right then and there before she even left my house!! I am one of the many women that carries a giant purse all the time and I have always struggled with the designer purses I buy because they never have enough pockets to correctly organize a purse. This totally solved my problem plus some. It also has little handles to switch purses in one minute or less instead of having to dump everything out and reorganize it in a new purse. For the price this can't be beat, I already bought them for both my mother and mother in law and a backup for myself!
B00HJCC9BA|5|great product love it
B000TV3LIS|5|This really does work to get the red out of my eyes.  I have trouble sleeping and this shows alot in my eyes (undereye circles and redness), but this does the trick (for the redness).  It seems to last for a while too.  Good product, but the only thing I don't like is that it's tested on animals so I won't be buying this again.
B00W3BU5DQ|4|There small but ok for on the goo 🏃👌
B009GIOVKW|3|works like it is supose to.
B00I4ZS8P2|5|Very nice product. Fast shipping.
B003FXG314|4|I guess I was looking for more of an illuminizer, this is more of a bronzer with a bit of shimmer to it.  Applies nicely, good price point but it blends in with my skin too much so doesn't look like I have anything on.  My skin tone is a warm beige color.
B00CTSA1D2|1|Boy sulfate free can't use with keratin treatment
B000SOLNSQ|5|These ice blankets are the perfect size and can also be cut to shape.  No more bulky ice bags to jab into your back.  These blankets are smooth and flat and comfortable to use.
B004NO4CCQ|5|This is the second one I purchased because I liked my original.
B00CMOJWFG|1|Received broken lipstick
B00JJQ6YVK|5|luv this produce
B006WVCEIC|2|I really wanted to like this product. The color is very nice for my hair but after washing my hair 3 days later it bled off on my towel. Everytime I blotted my hair more would come off. I never had this happen with any other dye and I have been dyeing my hair red for 2 years. It also did nothing to nourish hair like it said. Buy something else this product is not worth the money.
B00BG60IA4|5|I needed a small set to mix is a face mask, and this is perfect. It's got everything you need: measuring spoons, a knife thing to mix, and a brush to apply. The bowl is plenty big enough for me to mix up one mask. I love it!
B003DGKFV2|5|My favorite mascara ever!!! Have used it for years... I have sensitive skin, as well, & I've never had a problem with this.
B001MA0QY2|1|I have had this straightener for a year now (quit using it several months ago) and I am selling it. When I first got it, I noticed it did not glide smoothly through my hair (I have blonde hair that is naturally pretty straight but I like to get it stick straight). I thought maybe it was because it was new so I continued to use it. A few months after using it, my hairdresser asked me if I switched shampoo or was doing anything different because I had a lot of breakage in my hair. I had switched shampoo to a drug store brand from a salon brand, so I figured that was the reason why. I immediately went back to my salon brand thinking it would fix the problem. It didn't. My next salon appt she said that whatever I was doing with my hair I needed to stop because my hair was in terrible shape.<br /><br />I think I knew all along it was my straightener but I was in denial because of all the great reviews. But I finally accepted that this straightener was yanking, breaking, and pulling my hair out despite using very high quality hair products and wiping the plates down after each use. I am STILL working on getting my hair back to the perfect condition it was in. I had to chop off 6 inches of hair to start the process.
B0084HCIHY|5|This is a very good deal for the amount of shea butter. I read a lot of reviews and was skeptical about purchasing because a lot of people complained about the smell or the tub it came in was old and cracked. I received mine in perfect condition.<br />Shea butter has a somewhat strong nutty smell, its different. if you've never smelled it before then it probably smells funny at first but its not an awful smell like others posted. I use it in my homemade deodorant and lotions and loooove it.<br />I have bought shea butter before for THREE TIMES as much money and am more satisfied with this product. 32oz is a lot and this will last me a while but if I DO run out I wont hesitate to buy again.
B00CP7BYPG|5|I will always give my best review this product your smell I like you, really let my beard moisturized all day 24 hours no matter the weather
B0073D7B3G|5|Highly recommend using this to strengthen your nails!!
B001U88PK8|5|I absolutely LOVE the Panasonic Ladies Wet/Dry Epilator! I'd never go back to conventional epilators.    I love that I have the option of using it dry for when I'm short on time and spot a hair that grew faster than the rest. I can just epilate that sucker and be out the door the next second. And for those times when I have some time on my hands, I can loosen up my pores in the shower and so much less painfully remove hair. It's awesome that this product is completely submersible in water and nothing will happen to it. Eiplation is now so much better when I don't have to cringe just thinking about the pain.    The battery lasts really well on one charge and I've never had to stop in the middle of an epilation because the battery ran out.     The shaver attachment is a real plus! Very useful for grooming.    I appreciate the design where you can remove the top of the epilator and the shaver to clean them. Makes cleaning a breeze!!    Since I can use a moisturizing body wash to lather up for epilating, I find my skin so much softer. Not dry like before after epilation. The amount of hair and the speed in which it grows is also fairly less.    Overall I love this product and have absolutely no complaint at all.    I recommend this product to anyone who wants an easy, almost painless epilation in the shower or out, wet or dry. Awesome!!
B00KP5TS4Y|5|Great product! Works very well
B009NPOXT2|5|I love this spray i get so many compliments saying you smell so good what are you wearing!!  Love it!!
B004MUHVOC|5|Great leave-in conditioner for permed or natural curly hair. Makes hair soft & smooth. Best leave-in conditioner on today's market...you won't be disappointed with this product.
B004LXOLFM|5|otimo
B00KOW827M|5|Love, love, love, these brushes. Great dupes for my sigma brushes. Very little shedding.... firm yet soft bristles. Good buy.
B00008DQJQ|5|Lasted a very long time, and is only now running out of juice...<br />I suspect the battery has had it's fill of recharges, but have been very impressed with it's longevity.<br />Would buy another if available.
B0009DT39C|5|I really enjoyed this little lady!
B004MYJG3C|5|I love these perfumes just for the bottles, but this one is the cutest by far. The scent is also very nice.
B0015EOB50|5|I was looking for a color that was a little more coral than pink,  this is the perfect color!  It looks exactly like it did in the pictures and people compliment me all the time on this color.  It looks shiny like a manicure,  so pretty!
B000CCZ7ZE|1|I should have paid closer attention to the reviews- this product goes on nice with a good fragrance. However, within minutes the fragrance disappears. Others cannot smell it either. I will not recommend this product.
B001A3ATP2|5|I needed these in my life, mine always go missing. Strangely, these are hard to find in all the pharmacies. I like a the two bars to be close together and just a small opening at the tip. Most are made either too far apart to hold thinner hair or have a giant opening that's not necessary.
B001FDKGIW|5|Love this little clipper!<br />Trims beard, mustache easily.
B0015KUBBM|5|My aunt turned me on to Thieves Oil about a year ago after my Dad was diagnosed with cancer.  He was not ready to try it (still isn't) but I thought I'd give it a go.  I think it works!  I'm usually the person who catches every little cold and has perpetual allergies.  In a few more years I'll be the lady with tissue up her sleeves.  Now, I'm the one who people ask for a tissue and I pull a wad out of my purse/pocket and assure the asker, \\"Yes, they're clean.\\"  Since I started taking one drop each day, my daughter and my sweetie have both had colds But I Didn't Get Them!  That's practically unheard of.<br /><br />But the product can only do so much.  I spent three weeks with my sister helping her with her 4 year old twin boys and her newborn, while both boys had colds.  I didn't get enough sleep and spent most of my time with the germy little guys and found myself succumbing to the illness.  Still, the cold didn't seem as bad as it usually is.  I didn't have the sinus misery that I usually feel right in the days before I start sounding sick to everyone else.<br /><br />I'll keep using it.  I put one drop into a spoon every evening and add water.  I add water to the spoon several times before I go all in and lick the spoon.  Heavens.  Just be aware, it's . . . spicy, for lack of a better word.  At first it made my tongue numb too but that's mostly passed.<br /><br />Update:  One year later and I haven't had a cold.  (If you could see me, you'd witness me knocking furiously on wood right now.)  Now I just put a drop in my palm and lick it, having learned to avoid my lips and knowing which spot on my tongue is least likely to succumb to numbness.
B003981CSY|5|I purchased the mini styler because my hair is not thick...so I thought it would work well as both a travel hair iron and also a quick touch up at home. For my hair type, the iron works well. I don't know if this item would work for those who have thicker hair since it is a mini.
B00KGJDL42|5|I don't think that any brushes compare to bdellium tools I love every single brush including this amazing powder brush
B0016N0RZ8|4|Pretty good tweezers, not great, but pretty god.  A little pricey, I thought.
B004UOADUY|5|Great!
B0062C2HT2|1|BEWARE! This is not pure essential oil , also doesn't have any calming effect.<br />I would give this product a zero star if I could! This supposedly \\"pure essential oil\\" not only didn't make my kids calm but also make the three of us short of breath due to really bad allergy. I wrote a review for the seller and they deleted my review saying that it was not a seller review and it was a product review!!! Well, if you are claiming you have a product that suppose to calm the kids down but that's a lie ,shouldn't that be in seller's review?<br />Also I have used many essential oils before and if they are pure, they would not cause allergies. So to me , this is a fake product even though smells good.one of the questions when you are rating a seller is \\"product as described by seller ?\\"  But I guess to amazon that doesn't mean anything!<br />If you want to buy essential oils , buy \\"NOW \\" brand.
B00KCFAZTE|5|Great product.  Works great!
B00GXZS5VW|4|My significant other uses this. He says it's a good cleaner that leaves his face refreshed. Has not caused any skin irritation. He also uses Nivea shaving gel with this face wash for shaving.
B0027I5MSS|5|My therapist felt like this is The &#34;BEST&#34; gait belt out there! It is  a little Pricey But It is easier to adjust & works very Well!
B0052D4416|5|Came In The Perfect Color And Stays On All Day. They Do Make Your Lips A Little Dry So Put On Some Lip Balm Before You Put It On If You Plan On Wearing It All Day.
B00484OWDA|5|Recommended from a doctor!  I bought for my friend. She loved it.
B002WJHKL4|5|My favorite candle ever!  It arrived within the designated timeframe.  It was well packed to prevent breakage.  I was very pleased overall!
B00551QSUA|1|I am most likely going to throw away this broken case, dirty, already used looking eye shadow palette away. Too bad I can't give this product zero stars.
B00DNA0KD6|3|I was excited to try this because the reviews were good, but it doesn't look like anything on me. It has a nice texture on my lips, but no discernable color.
B0017MO88A|5|I use this every day. It is oily and can make a white residue, but blotting it on rather than smearing it on seems to help with the residue issue. After putting it on, I wait a while and then apply a mineral powder, thus reducing shine. (Then again, my skin is a bit dry.)  It may seem to take a little extra care to use it properly, but the alternative (not using and getting melanoma) is not appealing. A source states that unless the cream goes on white, it is not really protecting you. I hope it is really doing the job and will continue to use Neutrogena unless I come across an even better product.
B008Y9KPHC|5|It is a medium gray and looks really pretty with some sparkles over it or by itself. I love it!
B00HOHLKY2|1|Arrived with seal open on the bottle and not a &#34;full size bonus&#34; of the eye gel.  If you look at the comparable sizes in the picture, the jar I received was half the size or less.  Going back.
B004W24LQ6|5|I have very sensitive skin, and face wash I've used in the past has given me very dry skin and left my face red and blotchy.  Ever since I started using this particular Burt's Bees Sensitive Face Wash I have had ZERO problems!!  So, I keep using it and keep my fingers crossed, but after about two years my face is still happy every day.  I am a very happy, repeat customer! (and when you have Amazon Prime, why not order the stuff online?!  I've seen plenty of pharmacies and drug stores that didn't stock this particular cleanser).
B0002VAUGQ|1|I just received this shaver in a small yellow box, not in the original panasonic box. It must be refurbished one. This is the first time experience that I am unsatisfied with Amazon.
B00BQYYMQ2|3|the curls are pretty i really like it but its not enough hair since its really thin
B000VA82JA|5|I like this color because of the deep red.  I was happy that when it is polished on, goes on nice & even.
B003NCXXIS|1|This shaver can shave nothing; I got this shaver and was really excited but after using it I felt so bad and I was going to break it because it didn't shave any thing.
B006GQYSC8|5|I needed a new razor and had success with Norelco in the past.  I read reviews about current models and selected the AT810.  I found the best (and a good) price on Amazon, the product was delivered promptly and I have used it daily with great satisfaction.  The fact that it charges quickly and holds a charge for a long time in one of the reasons I purchased the product.
B000ELP5KA|4|I just started using EO and this is by far the strongest smell ever. However, as an antiseptic you can go wrong with natural EOs.
B004673LX6|1|The cream in both sets had liquefied & ate through the cover under the lid. The antioxidants didn't seem to be damaged.
B0045ZXAUI|5|I started using this product about two months ago and it really has improved the quality and health of my skin.
B009MJRDSC|5|Sulwhasoo products are the best
B000G1EQ1W|2|I was quite please with the self-cleaning system. Didn't shave as close as Remington Intercept I had before, but was ok. Unfortunately broke after barely a year of use! Now, I'm not sure what to do. I think it was battery, since it's not charging anymore. Shame, paid too much to see this happening...
B000TBVGBM|3|I should have read the reviews a bit more closely before purchasing this product. While my hair does appear to look brighter and more blonde, the smell is VERY fragrant. It has a floral scent that smells old, like a perfume my great-grandmother would have worn. I'm not saying its a terrible smell its just very overpowering.
B004OXDQBE|5|I am happy to purchase
B000F8L1G4|5|Beautiful. It's just what it is.
B000GHYWYW|1|I totally agree with previous comment. This perfume smells bad and nothing like original Aquazur I used to wear. Watse of money, don't buy.
B00J04NQL2|4|Great
B00IMPUTGU|5|Such a quality oil at an excellent price.  Very smooth and silky, blends well with my essential oils.  I would buy again for sure!
B005DU5MY6|5|Shipping was really fast. These dotting tools are good quality and pretty. Each side is a different size. I can't wait to start using them more!
B00CCB2102|5|I'll recommended.love it<br />Thanks
B00C5RM30G|5|I bought this based on good reviews but was concerned, as most of the &#34;gentle&#34; polish removers I've tried aren't very effective.<br /><br />This one is different.  It does a great job of removing polish, even darker shades, and does not cause any drying at all.  It also leaves a pleasant sort of fruity scent behind.<br /><br />There seems to be a difference of opinion between reviewers regarding the fumes while this is being used.  I don't find them to be any worse than anything else than I have used and I find there are fewer residual fumes in the room when I'm finished.<br /><br />My only real complaint is that it doesn't come in a bigger bottle.  The 6 oz. bottle isn't going to last long for anyone who does their nails on a regular basis.
B000QUM5LG|3|I guess it is alright. I had a CVS eye make up remover that worked better and was much cheaper! And it is oily so you have to wash your face with soap after using it.
B002GDKPUY|5|This dye works great and lasts for about a month
B008G2QULM|5|Wonderful smell!!!!
B00A9IMFWE|5|This item came very fast and I am very satisfied
B005JX36NG|5|I started using it this week. I must say, it's the best cleansing product I have ever used. Not only does it have a nice scent to it, but it makes your face feel smooth and fresh. I would definitely recommend this product to both male and female.
B0013CB1CK|5|Have been using this for about three years now and unlike products in the past it still works fine and I have not started having a reaction from it as I did from every product I tried until I discovered Clinique.
B0078PXU7U|5|i used this for my clip in extensions, sprinkle a tad and then clip your clip ins in!<br />Makes them stay in place and keep just enough texture for all day wear.<br />Love
B004Z7GBBG|5|This truly is one of the best tattoo ink deals out there. So very glad I ordered this set. The yellow is so bright!
B0026IBSVE|5|I have a short haircut and this does the job perfectly. All the accessories work fine and I couldn't be happier. I would recommend this product.  Rick
