6302859204|3.0|A seemingly standard alien abduction story until you realise it was based on a real person's account of one of these occurrences. The story is made more interesting by concentration on personal relationships within the affected group of men and a lot of time shifting and flashbacks within the framing device of a series of police interviews. The script, from Star Trek's Tracy Torm&eacute; is intelligent and subtle, spending time developing the characters, as well as exploring what the spaceship might have looked like. The special effects aren't that special, and the alien creatures (admittedly in Travis's head) are almost literal copies of those used in Close Encounters Of The Third Kind.<br />James Garner is under-used although he acquits himself well, and Robert Patrick is not charismatic enough to hold a lead role (Although the X-Files may yet prove me wrong). I would have preferred it if they had made Michael and Travis look a little ore different from each other, as I was constantly confusing the two. The rest of the cast is pretty good, if lacking the star status that could have lifted the film. The action is well paced throughout the film, making fight scenes between two men look as dramatic as those involving spaceships. I recommend you watch this, then decide how much of it really happened. ***
B00005QK3W|4.0|&quot;Driving Rain&quot; is a collection of brand new McCartney originals...and evident in almost every song are those  familiar and catchy &quot;McCartney&quot; hooks. Fifteen songs in all, my favorites so far are &quot;Driving Rain&quot;, &quot;Magic&quot; and &quot;I Do&quot;. The recently written and recorded &quot;Freedom&quot; performed at the Madison Square Garden Concert for New York in response to the events of September 11th, is included but NOT listed on the CD song list. Obviously added just within the past month or so, it is a nice surprise addition to the CD. The production on these songs is a bit more edgy and rough compared to &quot;Flaming Pie&quot;, but that makes them very fresh sounding and Paul's vocals show no sign of wearing out. Now Mr. McCartney, please give us for Christmas that rumored boxed set of rarities and unreleased tracks and along with &quot;Wingspan&quot; and &quot;Driving Rain&quot; 2001 will finish out with one heckuva McCartney hat trick!!!

B00005R2M3|2.0|primero antes que nada....I LOVE SHAKIRA......however this album is the worst i ever heard from someone so talented. shakira got lost in the air. shakira cambios los poemas por letra debiles &amp; mediocres....the only good songs in the album are the one in spanish and the translation of &quot;ojos asi&quot; which is already a hit en espanol. this album is too pop......less rock and not a touch of power.......i was looking for songs with the caliber of &quot;inevitable, moscas en la casa &amp; tu&quot;  if you really want to listen shakira at her best....LISTEN TO &quot;DONDE ESTAN LOS LADRONES&quot; and will be able to hear the difference. despite of the fact, i still love shakira and the best of her is yet to come....of course &quot;en espanol&quot;.......meanwhile i still listen to &quot;donde estan los ladrones&quot;...until a real good album of shakira comes out.
B00003CXZ1|5.0|I have played the &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; video games since 1995 and I was very skeptical about 2 things; a movie adaptation that would capture this phenomenon and an actress that would be believable. Well, to my pleasant surprise Director Simon West not only delivered on both accounts but exceeded to make Angelina Jolie &quot;Laura Croft&quot;!!!!!<br />Angelina (an Oscar winner) is a very credible actress and went through 3 months of prepatory training to become this video hero. Not only did she become Lady Croft but did all her on Stunts!!!! So believe me this a very credible Lara and the story is one of video game proportion.<br />Remember this a Lara Croft aka &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; adventure which is full of adventure, impossible odds and heroic accomplishments.<br />In Summary: We are introduced to Lady Croft at her English Mansion (very true to the games version). Her appearance, abilities, her attitudes and skills are very true to the game character too. And of course we have an impossible task to perform in the shortest period of time 1 week. Task - locate within the confinds of earth the 2 peices of an ancient triangular relic (Tomb Raiding is involved!!), solve the riddle &amp; location to perform the pagan ritual to reach immortality. Time - 1 week to scour the world, locate &amp; find the relics, for this ritual can only be performed when all 9 planets are aligned. This happens only once every 5000 years!!!!!! No problem for Lara Croft? Villians are abundant and the action continuous.<br />You can see this is a nail biter scenario &amp; you'll be sitting on the edge of your seat through this &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; adventure!!!<br />Lots of extras, to iclude Miss Jolies intense training and movie preparation.<br />The Widescreen digital picture &amp; sound are awesome!!!!<br />Thank you Simon West and Angelina Jolie for bringing Lara Croft &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; to the BIG SCREEN with credibility.

B00005QDW5|4.0|Ive just read an article in which Gilmour basically says that he has no more desire to tour and the band has no future plans for any kind of project. Well this is sad news, but to keep some of their pride I think that it's a good decision. I mean come on, they are all in their middle fifties now, and they haven't spoken to Waters in years. If it is true that they are done with this will probably be the last Floyd we see in awhile, but what a way to go out. True that it doesn't have all of their greatest hits or favorites, but you would need some sort of six CD box set to do that. I would have liked to see tunes like &quot;Brain Damage&quot; and &quot;Have a cigar&quot; but what are you going to do. You do get Echos in its full 23 minutes of sonic mastery. You do get Darkside classics such as &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Us and Them&quot; The new track or unrealeased track &quot;When the Tigers Broke Free&quot; sounds like something off of the Final Cut, it's okay at best. I would recomend this to any hardcore Floyd fan. I mean just for the cover art itself. But for any new person discovering Floyd, I would say stick to the albums. Dasrkside, Wish you were here, Aniamls, The Wall, Meddle, actually any would do to start with. They are all such classics.
B000002UJQ|5.0|OK, i'm not entirely familar with Thom Yorke and the Radiohead gang, this only being my second purchase of an album of theirs, the first being Kid A. I heard many good things about this album, which made me choose it over &quot;The Bends&quot; (my probable next purchase). The first listen will leave you confused, wondering what the heck you just bought, but some force...perhaps the need to justify the $15 you spent on the album...or maybe something more significant, i don't know, but this cd has yet to leave my cd player in the few days i've owned it. Each listen brings more light upon the significance of the lyrics, and reveals more portions of the melody that my have missed the first time through. It grows on you, it really does.
B00005QXXO|5.0|but I honestly think that some of the tracks on this live album sound better than when they were recorded for Kid A and Amneisac. The first track &quot;The National Anthem&quot; you can just tell within seconds that it was recorded very well. &quot;Idioteque&quot; &quot;Everything in its right place&quot; also jump out at you. The true gem of this short album though is &quot;True love waits&quot; which is Thom Yorkes voice and an acoustic guitar and that's it. It's brillant. I for one can't wait to see what these guys will do next?
B00005QXDD|5.0|From Soul to Country, from Rock to Punk, From Funk to Bach.  <BR>Tenacious d has single handedly saved popular music and made it safe to listen to again. This CD should not so much be listened to, but worshiped.  Kyle Gass and Jack Black should be heralded as prophets of a new musical golden age to come. And in these trying times we live in, its nice to just be able to sit back and laugh your a## off.   2 3 4
B000002A3T|5.0|Para mi PinkFloyd es 60% música y 40% letras. Por eso nunca me gustó The Final Cut el cual es 95% letras. En cambio The division<BR>Bell entrega un nivel musical de alto standar junto a letras profundas e interesantes por lo que este disco cumple plenamente con lo que yo espero de la banda. La combinacion Gilmour Wright compone sonidos que llegan directamente al alma como en Marooned por ejemplo, para que hablar del solo de guitarra horizontal de Gilmour al final de High Hopes. Quizá el  disco pueda tener algunos temas algo comerciales, pero considerado como un todo está en un muy alto nivel. Ojalá que  la banda sacara   en un futuro proximo otro disco tan bueno como éste. <br />Viva Pink Floyd.
B00005QK3W|5.0|This is a great album of songs but unusually for McCartney, they're not particularly catchy on first hearing (which I guess is a good thing).  They're growers. My favourites are LONELY ROAD, DRIVING RAIN, TINY BUBBLE, MAGIC and the bonus track FREEDOM but everytime I play it I get to like another one (a bit like ELOs excellent ZOOM album a few months back).  Just one moan for whoever designed the CD booklet though.  Considering that most people who'll buy this CD are going to be middle-aged or older can you please not print the lyrics and notes so tiny!!!  You need a magnifying glass to read them.  And isn't it about time record companies stopped printing lyrics and notes across groovy red backgrounds?  It was alright on the back of the large Sgt Pepper sleeve but these days in a microscopic CD booklet you can't read a thing!  Please think on CD booklet designers.  Oh for the days of a nice big twelve inch!  I'd buy the vinyl version of this record tomorrow but I no longer have a deck to play it on.  Anyway back to DRIVING RAIN, after a long wait McCartney's back and it's a good one, no question about it, just not what you might expect. Check it out.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|This is my absolute favorite movie. It's full of color and music. I'm a big fan of Nicole Kidman and that was the reason I saw this movie. Her singing was amazing and so was Ewan McGregor's. This is a must-see film if you're into musicals and romance. I can't wait to own it on video and watch it over and over again.
0446677450|3.0|Although Rich Dad, Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki was extremely repetative, he conveyed very useful information regarding ways in which your money can actually work for you. This book passes on the knowledge that cannot be attained from a school education and can make the difference between living a middle class life or a lavish one. It is a good step in the right direction to gain motivation and useful tactics for securing a stable future and becoming wealthy.  This book can be helpful for those without any previous knowledge in the business field
B00005R2M3|5.0|This is the first try of Shakira to enter the United States Market and this album promises to be the way. This album has excelent songs, the english one's sounds nice and the production is impecable. This is a good purchase........
B00005S6K8|5.0|Without getting into the controversy over which is better - this or the original - suffice to say that this movie stands on its own as an excellent, funny, warm and well-developed version of the story.<br />This is one of the (very) few tapes I keep out to watch and now I can finally retire one more!
B00005A46T|4.0|First of all, the screaming and severe lyrics are what Slipknot is all about.  If you are biased about this type of music and don't like it, then the last thing to do would be to listen to slipknot and then try to review it.  Slipknot's first LP had more of a hip hop vibe.  Their second album did lose that aspect, yet it doesnt mean their second album isnt just as good as the first.  As a band your supposed to mature in your music and so they decided to go in a slightly different direction.  The album is still just as good as the first even though it seems dissimilar.  New Abortion and People=(...) are 2 amazingly well put together songs and to say that the memebers of slipknot have no talent is a worthless statement.  Their talent shines in being able to manuever their instruments like they do.  Overall the album is definitly worth buying.  If you liked them before they won't let you down, they'll just give you a little twist.
B00005QDW5|4.0|This is a good-albeit non chronological-retrospective of Floyd's work 1967-94 (although they used the wrong version of &quot;astronomi donomi&quot;) but there are quite a few important songs that should be included but aren't. In fact, there are enough no-shows to fill a third dics: &quot;carefull with that ax&quot;, &quot;Nile song&quot;, &quot;if&quot;, &quot;lucifer Sam&quot;, &quot;empty spaces&quot; (movie version), &quot;pigs on the wing&quot;, &quot;remember a day&quot;, &quot;turning away&quot;, &quot;young lust&quot;, &quot;brain damage/total eclips&quot;, &quot;welcome to the machine&quot; and &quot;have a cigar&quot;. The albums &quot;More&quot;, &quot;Ummagumma&quot;, &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot; and &quot;Obscured By Clouds&quot; are not even represented. Maybe Capitol should be encouraged to release &quot;Echoes Vol. 2&quot;.
B00005QK3W|5.0|Please, can someone confirm if this edition of Macca's latest album includes or not the track &quot;Freedom&quot;? And if it does; is it the studio or live version of the song? Thanx.
6305696071|5.0|Pretty Woman is the Cinderella like tale of Vivian (Julia Roberts), a street wise and somwhat innocent prostitute, and Edward Louis (Richard Gere), a tough talking, and sincerly loving billionare! Edward hires Vivian for a week so he desn't have to deal with his two previously failed relationships (one with a girlfriend, and one with his ex-wife)for the week. <br />While Edward puts in long working days with ne client after another, Vivian lives the high life at the Regent Beverly Wilshire, goes shopping on Rodeu Drive (after being turned away by the snubby shopkeepers), goes to a mach of Polo, and goes to the Oprea in San Francisco (they take his jet). <br />In the midst of all this, Vivian and Edward fall in love, it's as simple as that. Julia Roberts, in the role that made her a star, gives a simply wonderful, witty, hillarious, and heart touching performance. Richard Gere gives a great performace as well, but he obviously falls back in the light Julia shines on this film, she is without a dought the star!<br />If you love Julia Roberts (and who wouldn't, she's a great actress!)this is the film to see! After all, it made her a star, and is a great example of her early work. Roberts and Gere are such a great team, they were later teamed again in Runaway Bride. If you love Runaway Bride, you'll love Pretty Woman.<br />Get it, see it, you'll love it!

0790744759|5.0|It's hard to belive that this, one of Judy Garland's best, and most remembered roles of her life, almost didn't happen. Judy didn't want the role, she wanted more adult parts, and not the part of a teenager, again. She was thankfully convinced by whatever person to play the role, and it became one of her best. Judy said &quot;That was the first time I felt beautiful on film.&quot; She credited her beauty in that picture to the director, and her soon to be husband, Vincene Minnelli. (with whom she would have Liza, a year later)<br />Out of this film came many classic songs including, &quot;Meet Me in St Louis&quot;, &quot;The Trolly Song&quot;, but the one that would become a classic among classics would be &quot;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas&quot;, which would become a holiday classic, although let it be known, it was written for and in part by Judy Garland.<br />Also featured in this film is Margaret O' Brien, as Tootie, the seven year old sister to Judy. She gives a simply wonderfully cute performace, always a bundle of energy, even when she's mad and crying that they must leave St. Louis and miss the 1904 World's Fair.<br />This film is the story of the Smith family of St. Louis, who's perfect world (hey it's a MGM musical) is shattered when Mr. Smith is told that his boss is trasfering him to New York.<BR>But of course on Christmas Eve of 1903, he announces to the family that they will not be moveing!<BR>The film ends with them attending the Fair, which to them is a sight to ehold, with it's electric lights, and technological advancements. <br />This is a simply perfect film, and Judy does,infact, look beautiful throughout! If you haven't saw this classic, don't pass it up simply for it's age. This is a film not to be missed!<BR>How bad could it be? After all it stars the World's Greatest Entertainer, the force of nature, Judy Garland!
6304293321|5.0|I saw this movie 25(?) years ago and cried as a little girl. Now that I am 38 and I watched it again from a completely different perspective, I think I cried even more. This is a movie that ALL must see!! It is the most heart-warming story ever written. I am so glad that Joy and George Adamson shared their story of Elsa with the rest of the world!!!!
0060392886|4.0|I followed the Crue as a loyal headbanger in the 80's and even saw there first tour with Ozzy. I remember skipping school and going to the record store with my friend to buy the Shout at the Devil tape. We felt very subversive owning it, because the Crue were quite dangerous and controversial to us at the time. The did rock in their live show, though. This book was almost too descriptive, almost too much sleaze to read, but strangely this book was one that was hard to put down. It had depth to it in it's description of the band members childhoods and give a good indication of why they turned out the way they did. Its amazing that they are still alive. The book is a very decadent portrait of very shallow, immoral, selfish yet creative people who got together to make some great music. The end of the book shows the changes in attitude and beliefs of the members and how they view each other and Motley Crue, but the book seems like an honest, no hold barred portrayal of 4 guys against the world. A very interesting read.
B00005QIPH|3.0|The Strokes are NOT the saviors of rock and roll, repeat NOT.  This disc is decent to be sure but the vocal technique is pretty grating and most of the songs never really take off.  With the exception of two fine, bouncy numbers, \\"Someday\\" and \\"Last Nite\\", Is This It just isn't all that exceptional.  For the most part, the rest of the disc just runs together, with one cut being about the same as the next.  Not a bad effort but anyone looking for garage rock thrills can do better than this.
6304297912|5.0|Trainspotting is an extraordinarily well crafted film in terms of the various elements of film technique- lighting, sound, acting, screenplay, dialogue, color, composition, camera and editing.     The theme is fresh. Youth is a stage that is fraught with danger in testing the waters, and rites of passage, a stage that in modern western culture has no prearranged stage or ceremony.     Neither are there role models nor family. The parents are out to lunch although they do their best- who doesn't? Volatile, sensitive Youth is for all practical purposes alone, dangerously alone, with no boundaries or self-control. Renton, our hero, does heroin. His unsavory pal does liquor and people. Self-afflicted damage vs damage to others is an under current theme of Trainspotting. Money is everywhere, as are drugs, those of discontent housewives, and those found in bars, as well as illegal ones. Self-medication is rampant, stylized (not glorified) in the film.     Brilliant color schemes and set design hark back to Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange yet add something new and different. Neglect of youth is generational and a threat to young life and society. Theme is brilliantly expressed via the superb acting of Ewan MacGregor and all the others. Nothing is left to chance, no detail too unimportant to convey, in the brilliant directing work of Danny Boyle.     The editing conveys the restless pace of angst-ridden young heroin addicts, along with the brilliantly selected score by Bowie and Iggy Pop, and Lou Reed, among others. In the opening scene alone, all the elements of film work together to present theme and introduce characters: Renton colliding with a moving car, grinning with bold mischief when he realizes he has triumphed over death; Sick Boy and Alison swooning with ectasy when they shoot up, the gaudily colored set vs the reality of the shabby drug house and neglected baby of young parents who are too busy trying to escape from reality to care for the one they love the most.All is incredibly and expertly choreographed to Bowie's and Iggy Pop's title track. Even the voice-over narration by Renton works remarkably well, a feat in and of itself, given the sorry track record of most film narrations. This is a tragic story, and far from \\"glorifies\\" hard drug abuse. It is also rich with blackly humorous dialogue, acting and camera work- the \\"worst bathroom in Scotland \\"scene, for instance. The film is visually stunning, poetically inspiring and meticulously directed. And it raises a few more questions about the values of society than it answers, which is what any decent work of art should do.
B00005OM4N|3.0|Britney's effort to do a combination of Destiny's Child and Rap is as poor as Christina Aguilera's effort to do Christmas songs. Britney's vocals hit those really soft high pitched tones that is best suited for ballads a la Oliva Newton-John style making her first CD Baby One More Time a big hit.  Christina has a super voice that hits low pitches best suited for R&amp;B and Jazz sounds. Had Britney stuck to the tones she used in 'Soda Pop' or 'One Kiss for You' this third album would have been better but instead she till employs that higher pitched tone and it really does not sound suitable any more than a low pitched Christina singing Silent Night.  Don't get me wrong: both Christina and Britney are very talented and can really sing well, but for certain types of music.  Hitting those really high pitched soft notes and those really low pitched jazzy notes is something few artist can do both well e.g. Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey.  I'll give Christina one up on Britney because Christina can make mediocre written and styled music sound good because it's her expert  delivery.  To some extent Britney can do that too, but it certainly can't be found in this third album.  The only reason I'm being critical even though I really like previous efforts is because if you tell a favorite singer they are good when they're not they will only turn around and produce more of the same.  So if it's not up to caliber (or at least your standards) fans should be honest.  In all fairness to Britney less time was spent this year on this album because she has committed almost all her time on her coming movie &quot;Crossroads&quot; and from what I hear from film critics and other actors Britey's performance and the movie will be very good.
B0000508U6|5.0|This album is amazing.  Really reflective of Radiohead during &quot;The Bends&quot; period.  Everyone should own this c.d.
B000007638|4.0|For Christmas 1976, Wings released the triple live set of their most triumphant tour.  Most of the material is from &quot;Band On The Run&quot;, &quot;Venus And Mars&quot;, and &quot;Wings At The Speed Of Sound&quot;, as well as a few Beatle hits.  The band here comes off rocking harder than their studio albums would lead you to believe, and you often can't help but remember what the excitement was all about then.  A great show.
B00005R2M3|5.0|Laundry Service is just awesome. Shakira brings in tango, Andean tunes and her trademark Middle Eastern sound and mixes all those with rock and roll, to create another great album. Shakira did a remarkable job in The One, a wonderful rock ballad. Poem to a horse is just great, perhaps the best song in the album. I also like Whenever, Wherever/Suerte because it has an incredible beat and the cultural diversity represented in this track is unbelievable. I also recommend Que me Quedes Tu for its innovative sound and superb lyrics. But of course these are just my favorites, and you'll have to listen to the CD for yourself to create your own opinion. However, I'm sure Shakira won't disappoint anyone. Congratulations to the Colombian goddess of rock and roll!!!  PEACE FOR ALL.
B00005LKHW|4.0|Four high school guys, horrified at the thought of the class nerd scoring before them, make a pact to lose their virginity before prom night. This fresh take on the genre has genuinely likable characters (except Stifler) and the guys (except Stifler) actually respect the females that they pursue. Highlights include gross-out gags (see for yourself) and interactions between the hapless Jim (Jason Biggs) and his well-meaning dad (Eugene Levy). Honesty, good characterizations, and talented young cast make this a cut above the rest. In this &quot;unrated&quot; version the differences amount to a few seconds and a different take is used of Jim with the apple pie (again, see for yourself). Extras include commentary, trailers for this and &quot;American Pie 2&quot;, a sneak peek at &quot;American Pie 2&quot;, spotlight on location, production notes, cast and filmaker profiles, Tonic's &quot;You Wanted More&quot; music video (and a live performance), music highlights, a photograph montage, outtakes, deleted scenes, poster concepts, and classic quotes. Two-disc set has option of widescreen or full frame.
B000059H98|3.0|This is a top-grade B movie. I never got around to seeing it until recently when it aired on Comedy Central. With the combination of the silly post-apocalyptic plot, funny mutant characters, and ULTRA SEXY Lori Petty, I had to own it. <br />Bonus: Look for Naomi Watts, who plays an innocent young actress in David Lynch's &quot;Mullholland Drive&quot; in theatres now.
B00005Q66T|5.0|Ok, so there were a few songs that were left out and a few songs that did not deserve to be on a CD titled Greatest Hits, but the CD is still a great buy for the casual Madonna fan.  And for those of us who are Madonna Fanatics, it's ok to buy to add to the collection but not to get excited over new material, which this CD lacks.  For those of you who enjoy the singles released, buy this CD.  For those of you interested in seeing alot of pictures of Madonna, buy this CD.  I suggest you just buy this CD.  It does not go in chronological order as The Immaculate Collection did, so don't expect to go through the years in order.  I give it 5 stars because the songs on the CD are great, inspirational songs and plus, it's Madonna.  How can you not give it 5 stars?
B000002H2H|5.0|RIDE THE LIGHTING is probably one of the greatest metal albums ever made. The music is fast and furious and shows why Metallica was far above other metal bands at this time. The lyrics cover the topic of death from different angles. FADE TO BLACK covers suicide, RIDE THE LIGHTING covers execution, FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS covers death in war and FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE covers nuclear war. There are no weak spots on this album and it should be in every metal fans collection. Every song is great and can stand on its own, but put them together, this album is dangerous.
B000055Y0X|5.0|Kubrick is most famous for his science fiction masterpiece 2001: a space odyssey. yet i have to pose a question for his loyal fans. is it his best film? before you answer you must take into account what makes up a great Kubrick film; humor, violence, character development, and most importantly his flare for ingenious camera work and lighting. personally, i think Kubrick movies are made up of three things which make his movies popular as well as successful. one: his camera work,  two: his disturbing and/or haunting images and three: my personal fav, the endings or climaxes of his films. if you really look at all of his movies, what is it that really makes his films so desirable?  it is the fact that we are going to see something on that screen that will make us think, put us in awe, make us uncomfortable, and most importantly we will see something that no other director has been given the power to show. that last statement actually makes alot of sense, seriously, who in the early 70's could have put a movie like  A CLOCKWORK ORANGE into  American theatres? only Kubrick. any other name and WB would have laughed them out the door. so lets talk about a CLOCKWORK ORANGE. a CLOCKWORK ORANGE is built entirely on frightening and disturbing images, nothing more nothing less. if it werent for the untarnished camera work and the X rated and disturbing scenes this movie would have flopped, because personally a person going to jail for murder and rape is not an intersting story in and of it self. but that is where Kubrick put his touch, this movie is one of the greatest films ever made, due to the shocking images and the camera work. oh..and lets not forget the great soundtrack, that is also a huge part of the success. it is funny because all of Kubricks films have the same outline of success. he was famous because he would show things that noone else would show. cut and dried that was the foundation for his success. there is one thing that really makes me angry when someone talks about Kubrick. they call him a genious..well that can be argued..but the thing that i cant get out of my mind is the fact that he based every movie on one or two scenes of &quot;shock&quot;  which in turn would be on the viewers mind the entirety of the film. so in the parts that were slow, you were still thinking of that or those scenes in which you had just viewed and pondering how or why anyone would put that in a movie. he was the greatest shock director, who only did one horror flick. there are a couple of films that Kubrick did that really didnt have the one or two shocks. those could argueably be his best films. Dr. Strangelove is definitely one of them. the movie is hilarious and darkly disturbing. and has one of the  most nerve numbing endings in movie history. a SPACE ODYSSEY is his hands down masterpiece, but personally not my favorite Kubrick film. why you say? the G rating. really the only thing that kept me glued to the screen was the phenomonal special effects. i personally found the space travel scene towards the end fairly boring. but the highlight of the movie was HAL 9000. maybe the most creepy AI the film industry has ever seen and along with the star child climax ending this movie really made me think, which i love. a definite masterpiece, one of the 10 greatest movies ever made. i dont have enough time to write everything i have to say. but to end this, Kubrick is one of the greatest directors the world has seen. in my opinion, everyone of his movies are great, everything about them is unique. i havent seen a movies that caused more controversy. which is what i want to see. something that i havent seen before. i also would like to state that the only movie that recently has came out that could even come close to a Kubrick film, is AMERICAN PSYCHO. that movie is in the vein of Kubrick films, perhaps we will see more like it. but i doubt anyone will come close to Kubricks prowess.
B000002H6C|5.0|...AND JUSTICE FOR ALL is a metal classic that shows Metallica being fast and furious. The album deals with the decline of the American Dream and the abuses of those in power. The title track, is an epic tune that clocks in at almost 10 minutes but never gets boring. EYE OF THE BEHOLDER, THE SHORTEST STRAW FRAYED ENDS OF SANITY are also rockin tunes that makes this album great. ONE is the standout tune on this album, and can send a chill down the listeners back. I think that one song here DYERS EVE, is an underrated song that sometimes doesnt get the recognition that it deserves. BLACKENED is the song that jump starts the album and prepares the listener for what they are about to listen to
0553573403|5.0|Martin is one of the few authors who can keep me reading until the small hours of the morning. He creates a world that is totaly convincing in all it's minute detail, resembling our own in all its splendour and squalor: unlike most fantasy, Martin's kings run out of cash, &quot;noble&quot; knights are often atypicaly ignoble, the &quot;bad guys&quot; are often likable, the &quot;good guys&quot; stupid, sometimes brutal. As in the real world, the guys in the white hats don't always prevail, and anybody and everybody is in constant danger of loosing his or her head (literaly). Martin abandons the sugary and idealistic view of love so prevalent in fantasy as a genre and instead shows us a world where love is often divorced from sex, and prostitutes and illigitimate children abound. Martin creates a rich and varied backdrop against which his characters perform, without belaboring us with detail in the manner of Robert Jordan, working it seamlessly into his narrative. His characters are well-rounded and beatifuly drawn, his prose style changing subtly from one character to another, giving them a refreshing individualty. His practice of devoting a chapter to one character at a time, and constantly shifing viewpoints, allows his narrative to move at a brisk pace, without devoting huge blocs of text to describing absolutely everything that happens in relation to a particular character (a problem that has slowed the story of Jordan's 'Wheel of Time' to the speed of an especially slow glacier), allowing the reader to fill in the blanks. I could go on in even more detail, but other reviewers have covered the myriad virtues of Martin's tale. I strongly recomend this book to anyone sick of the rather naive and long-winded fantasy that has been churned out over the last decade or so!
B000002H33|5.0|If you are a fan of the nu-metal out there today, then you need to go out and get this album from the band that was the best metal band in their prime. MASTER OF PUPPETS is a classic metal album that shows Metallica in their best form ever. It was the last album made with Cliff Burton on bass and closes out a period of time, in my mind, where Metallica made a trilogy of classic metal albums. The songs here cover topics standard for metal music, MASTER OF PUPPETS, deals with the topic of drug abuse, WELCOME HOME(SANITARIUM) takes us into the mind of an unbalanced person, DISPOSABLE HEROES, deals with war. We are also lucky to have here ORION which is a great instrumental that just builds and builds till its conclusion. Go out and get this album and you will no why Metallica is a great band.

B00005LOUP|1.0|The lasting appeal of Dr.Seuss' books and what makes them rereadable long after you know the plot was the wit and imagination he applied to what were in many cases, fables . While an entertaining story, there is also an element of the Grinch that laments the commercialization of Christmas and the importance placed on the size of the gift rather than the sentiments with which it is given. While a spectacular example of makeup and prodcution design, Ron Howard's film falls prey to the same base material instincts that the story warns against. More emphasis is placed on the action set pieces ( like the sled ride) and crass jokes about bodily functions than on what makes Christmas a meaningful experience. The Grinch through this film becomes means to sell movie tie-in merchandise which is a sad bastardization of the original story. Basic elements of the story like the ability to have Christmas without gifts are dwarfed by sled pyrotechnics and simpleminded exposition for why the grinch is mean. The magic of the book is that it is entertaining and inspries thought this film just encourages the viewer to stop thinking and ooh and aah. There are things more important in life than presents but in a film so dedicated towards to glossing over the anti-commercial elements of Seuss' story with mindless action and low brow humor, it's impossible to see what they could possibly be. Do you and your family a favor, spend a couple more dollars, buy the book and read it to your kids.

0380789019|5.0|\\"Neverwhere\\" by Neil Gaiman is a weird and dark fantasy that departs from today's typical sword and sorcery  novel.  What I enjoyed in Gaiman's novel is the alternate universe that he creates.  Travelling his world of tunnels and passageways you pass through areas that are full of strange creatures and even stranger people.  Lurking among the inhabitants of \\"Neverwhere\\" you have rat-speakers, angels, beasts, sewer folk and all sorts of oddities.<br />I especially enjoyed the characters Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar.  Sometimes you can measure a book by its antagonists, usually the better the novel the better it's evil characters.  These two were completely evil and yet hysterical.<br />The novel focuses upon Richard Mayhew an ordinary man working for an investment firm in London, UK.  He is engaged to be married to a dominating yet beautiful woman and seems destined for a quiet, ordinary life.  Until he stumbles into a situation that is beyond his control and understanding.  This ordinary person put into an extraordinary situation may seem trite and overused;  however, here it works.<br />Quite honestly I thought I was going to hate this book.  I was expecting a comic book-like quality to the writing, but I was wrong.  The writing is crisp.  The dialog interesting.   I enjoyed the atmosphere Gaiman creates and the weird people he manufactures....  In a word it's fun.<br />If fantasy is your thing and you are looking for something a little bit different I recommend \\"Neverwhere\\".
B000002OX3|4.0|The Who's second album, A Quick One, is something that should have a place in every Who fan's collection. Many people have an outlook on the Who's music and sound that is all wrong. There are many simple yet genius &quot;pop&quot; melodies evident on these recordings but the raw energy that is known of The Who is still there. It was The Who's attitude and musical presentation that made them such a great band and this is why their sound has never really been succesfully captured on record. Fortunately, this album is a solid attempt at recreating this image. Atmittably there are filler selections evident on the album that were not necessary but overall it's a good package. Townshend's innovative song writing style breaks free on such tracks as, &quot;So Sad About Us&quot;, &quot;Disguises&quot;, &quot;Magic Bus&quot; and in particular the 10 minute mini-opera &quot;A Quick One (While He's Away)&quot;. This track introduced an idea that would later lead Townshend and The Who to fame and an exciting new revelation in rock music that became &quot;rock opera&quot;. It's very interesting to see Townshend's writing style progress over the years and &quot;A Quick One&quot; is a bold new introduction to a bold new form of coherent, maddening, whimsical rock.
B00000099Y|5.0|This CD is by far the best CD of all time. There's not a CD that even compares to it. Everything about this CD is amazing, The lyrics, the guitar work, the bass work, the incredible drumming, even the friggin interludes are amazing (&quot;(-) ions&quot;)! I love every single track on this CD (except &quot;Hooker with a Penis&quot;), because of all the different elements that each and every song has. Let's use &quot;Eulogy&quot; for an example. Starts with some soft sampling, the drums start playing at a very soft level, then the heavy guitar kicks in, and after a verse, it turns into a very heavy song. Then it mellows out again, only to get heavy all over again. &quot;Forty Six &amp; 2&quot;, which may be the best song on the CD (or world), starts with an eerie bass riff, and then the guitar kicks in, which makes up for the most beautiful intro on any CD ever. Not to mention about a minute later, it gets heavy. But the best song on the CD is probably that song or &quot;Third Eye&quot;, a very experimentive 14 minute classic. Everything from Bill Hicks quotes from sampling to soft guitar to multiple drum solos, and definitely some of the best vocals ever.<br />If you don't have this CD yet, you are a very sad human being who needs to wake up and ask yourself, &quot;What am I doing?&quot;. You can still save yourself though, stop reading and go get this CD now.
B00005J6UP|5.0|This movie here is a sterling example of how you can make your imagination come alive and create a world of fun, intrigue, surprise and adventure.<br />We have 7 likeable kids living in a small community with close ties and lots of history and memories.  Coming along to spoil the show, we have a wealthy land developer with his brat of a son as a sidekick who want to raze the town and turn it into a golf resort.<br />Not willing to be uprooted from their beloved town, the industrious kids (with the help of a found treasure map and a local pirate legend) stumble upon a passage that could possibly lead them to treasure.<br />Getting to this point was only half the fun.  Now we're really in for a good time!  Enter the danger, adventure and all out pursuit of treasure.  We follow the 7 youngsters through booby traps, dark caverns, perilous near misses, and exciting exploits that is sure to grab the imagination of adults and children alike.  And all this while being chased by 3 bumbling but quite funny counterfeiters who add a great touch to the plot.<br />Moving right along, while avoiding all the pitfalls that might trip up most people (but not these young Indian Jones proteges), they discover the ultimate prize in the form of a long hidden Pirate ship located in a lagoon enclosed by a mammoth cave.<br />Upon searching the ship (and dodging more inventive booby traps to boot), the pirates treasure is found which is a means to an end to pay off the land developer to save the town.<br />Not so fast!  No easy getaway for these bunch of resourceful and rambunctious little ones.  Along comes those dastardly counterfeiters destined to spoil the show.  A little walking the plank, some sword fighting, and a whole lot of fun and the baddies are put out of business.  The exit from the cave is no walk in the park either being that the cave itself was booby trapped (yep, another booby trap and a good one).  With the help of a lovable monster and a whole lot of strength, the kids leave the cavern as fast as you please.<br />Believing that upon leaving the cavern that the treasure was lost in the lagoon, alas, we have one of the seven heroes who spirited away several gemstones from the Pirate ship that will save the day for the future of the town!<br />Now, who do we have to thank for this excellent adventure?  Well, let's first look at one of the executive producers.  Steven Spielberg.  Arguably the best movie director who has ever been associated with the silver screen and motion pictures.  Almost every piece of work that Spielberg has ever done has turned to gold and he is a master of exceptional movie making.<br />Next, we have director Richard Donner who is behind the blockbuster Lethal Weapon movies and many more greats too numerous to list. He has done an excellent job of making a movie that audiences can count on time and again to enthrall them and make them feel great.<br />This is absolutely 5 stars of fun and excitement all the way and is a sure winner anytime, anywhere.  Highly recommended all around.  Enjoy!ave the cavern as fast as you please.<br />Believing that upon leaving the cavern that the treasure was lost in the lagoon, alas, we have one of the seven heroes who spirited away several gemstones from the Pirate ship that will save the day for the future of the town!<br />Now, who do we have to thank for this excellent adventure?

B00005QK3W|2.0|I've been a Paul McCartney fan for over 35 years now.  I've listened avidly to everything he has released (including the abysmal &quot;Fireman&quot; CDs and the equally vapid &quot;Liverpool Sound Collage&quot;).  When he's on, he's really on;  few can match his ability to create a memorable melody, his best arrangements are unbeatable, his voice is one of the most versatile instruments ever committed to sound recordings, and he is an absolutely brilliant bass player.  Which is why it's such a disappointment when he's off.  Because when he's off, he's really off.<br />With &quot;Driving Rain,&quot; he's off.  The first single from the CD, &quot;From A Lover To A Friend,&quot; is a meandering, unfocused mess.  &quot;Heather&quot; is a pleasant little ditty (nothing more), and &quot;I Do&quot; (my favorite) is a lovely throwback to McCartney at his melodic best, but most of the rest of the CD is just THERE.  It isn't particularly good, nor particularly bad.  It just IS.  And we all know McCartney can do better than that.<br />&quot;Rinse the Raindrops&quot; is particularly offensive, more than ten minutes of rambling, obnoxious NOTHING going on.  And much has been made of the eleventh-hour addition to this CD of &quot;Freedom,&quot; the song McCartney wrote in response to the September 11 terrorist attacks, and performed at the Concert for New York (which he organized).  But it really isn't much of a song, gaining more points for good intentions than for actual musical value.<br />This CD is receiving glowing reviews from the likes of Rolling Stone magazine and other publications, and many reviewers are making note of the fact that most of the lyrics to these songs reflect McCartney's life right now, especially hisrelationship with his new bride-to-be.  With all of that inspiration, I would have expected him to come up with something more than this bland effort.  I might also note that McCartney's usually nimble voice sounds somewhat ragged throughout this CD (especially when he tries to sing above his range), and the band is nondescript ( a real letdown after the wonderfully dynamic band he had for &quot;Off the Ground&quot; and &quot;Tripping the Live Fantastic&quot;) <br />Don't make this your first McCartney CD.  Try &quot;Flaming Pie,&quot; &quot;Flowers in the Dirt,&quot; &quot;Tug of War,&quot; or my absolute favorite, &quot;Unplugged&quot;.
B00005QK3W|5.0|About a minute and a half into the song &quot;About You,&quot; the music stops as Paul belts out the line, &quot;When did you teach me to fly thru the air.&quot;  It's a completely exhilerating moment and symbolizes what the album Driving Rain is all about:  dealing with loss (obviously Linda), but recovering, standing up, and getting, in his words, &quot;Back In The Sunshine Again.&quot;  In my opinion, Driving Rain has more emotion and depth than any solo McCartney album ever.  You can feel Paul's pain and anguish in his voice in the bluesy &quot;Lonely Road.&quot;  The lyrics to &quot;From A Lover To A Friend&quot; are a little vague at some points, but the hook and Macca's delivery are so powerful and emotional that it makes some of the lines irrelevant anyway.  Beyond these first two songs, the album becomes less about dealing with loss and more about celebrating life, especially Linda's in the touching, yet universal in meaning tribute song &quot;Magic,&quot; with rememberances of when they met and later the memories of their life together &quot;burning so bright.&quot;  Other favorites for me include the country-flavored &quot;Your Way,&quot; &quot;Heather,&quot; &quot;Your Loving Flame,&quot; &quot;Riding Into Jaipur,&quot; and &quot;Rinse The Raindrops,&quot; which shows that Paul can still rock with anyone.  &quot;Freedom&quot; displays Paul's tough and defiant side.  Many years ago the Beatles told people to &quot;free your mind,&quot; and in this new anthem Paul is standing up for that right!  Driving Rain is fantastic, and Paul McCartney is at the top of his game.  Buy this album, put it in the disc player, and go for a drive--a ride in the driving rain!  It's a beautiful thing.
0375431624|1.0|I have never in my life read a book that (...) me off more than this horrible little book. At first I liked it well enough, though I did think the wife, Nora, was much to concerned with what people she wasn't even close to would think about her and her husband skipping Christmas. But by the last 4 chapters I was dreading each word. Could such a wonderful message really end by backtracking on everything the rest of the book was about? How could a couple that was treated so poorly by neighbors and associates in the end welcome them with open arms, just for the sake of how they would appear to their daughter and a total stranger? After all their hard work and their wonderful dreams, how could they turn their back on their plans and decide that instead of telling a 23-year old the truth, that lying to their own daughter was the better option? Is it too much to ask that people are supportive of other people choices in their own lives which has no impact on anyone elses life?  This book is all about what is wrong with Christmas in the end. Fake friends, false happiness, buying and giving gifts just because Tis the Season. Luther had it right, make yourself happy. You only live once.

I think this latest gem just goes to further prove what a multi-faceted writer he is.  This was a hilarious, touching look at Christmas and traditions and trying to break them!  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes a quick read that will make you both laugh and cry!
B00005R2M3|4.0|Habre que darle un poco mas de tiempo a este album, ya que hace solo 1 dia que lo he estado escuchando.  Pero por lo que veo, no llega a la altura de &quot;Donde estan los ladrones&quot;, su ultimo album.  Me gustaria que sacase un album para el mercado latino.  Parece que su transicion al mercado norteamericano tuvo un poco de dificultad.  Espero que tenga otros albums como &quot;Donde estan . . .&quot; en el futuro. Y espero que no la traten de &quot;una mas&quot; como Ricky Martin o Enrique Iglesias.
B00005QXXO|5.0|Nothing could have better captured radiohead's live energy than this cd. The album opens with the bass driven song that every concert opens with, The National Anthem, followed by I Might Be Wrong. Even though the guitars are heard to hear, its still pretty awesome. Morning Bell (Kid A) is perfect. Another pleasant surprise is the live version of Like Spinning Plates, which is completely driven by Thom and his baby grand. Ideoteque is probably the most energetic track on the album. The sixth song starts out with a lost chant but suddenly changes into Everything In Its Right Place. Dollars And Cents is way more guitar driven than the Amnesiac version, but Radiohead saved the best for last. True Love Waits (previously unreleased) is easily one of the most moving songs Radiohead plays, and you will not be disappointed. Any Radiohead fan will love this cd.
B00005QK3W|1.0|All Paul did on this LP is bring in a hip producer to re-package the same songs he's been writing for 40 years into a new style.  The music is less than innovative (most of the songs use guess which chords?  A minor, C, E minor, and D minor!  WOW!!  Thats a first for Paul!), and the lyrics are downright embarrassing.  &quot;If you're part of my love, dont leave home tonight.  While we're sleeping we can learn to see that all the world's a tiny bubble.&quot;  Say what?  &quot;1 2 3 4 5 lets go for a drive?&quot;  Youre kidding, right?  It gets better, er, i mean worse throughout the album.  The topics range from a girl who &quot;given up talking,&quot; but only at school, she &quot;yappa-yap-yaps&quot; at home. Oohhh---kaayyy.....More silly love songs, a song about the earth's rotation among other atrocities.  I really think Paul is losing his marbles on some of the tunes....what the heck is &quot;the season of the culture bat?&quot;  I guess when you're a billionaire Beatle you can write whatever nonsense you want for a rhyme and get away with it.  &quot;Rinse The Raindrops&quot; rips off everyone from the Beatles to the Doors.  He tries to sound hard core at the end by screaming, but he just sounds silly.  &quot;Riding into Jaipur&quot; is a silly Beatle parody.  David Kahne's production is good, and is the only reason to listen to this horrible album. Well, lonely raod and your way aint bad.  but not worth 15 bucks. The songs are re-hashed and tired, and show none of the inspiration, creativity, and passion he displayed on Flaming Pie and Run Devil Run.   If you dont expect much from your music, and enjoy bland pop music like the Backstreet Boys or Britney Spears, then this lifeless album is fine.   Otherwise, anyone with a critical bone in their body should steer clear from this atrocious mess.
B00005QK3W|4.0|This is Paul's most &quot;Beatlesque&quot; album in quite some time.  The jamming &quot;Rinse the Raindrops&quot; could easily fit on Abbey Road while &quot;Riding Into Jaipur&quot; could fit easily on The White Album.  My personal favorite is the moody and slightly disturbing &quot;She's Given Up Talking&quot;...a great song!<br />The album as a whole is very upbeat and fast moving.  The love songs are still here but don't slow down the pace and spirit of the album.  An excellent album! Play it loud!
B00005O5CM|5.0|I normally dont care for chic flic's but this movie is very funny.I like the part when she goes dressed as a playboy bunny. Reese Witherspoon deserves a oscar for her proformance of valley girl Elle Woods the harvard law student.The dog is great also as brusier woods.My whole family loves this movie.
B000007O9L|5.0|The Stones have released so many live albums over the years that I was a skeptic when this first came out, thinking it was just the usual filler material between studio albums.  But the intimate quality of &quot;Stripped&quot; proved me wrong and it stands as their best release since &quot;Tattoo You&quot; back in 1981.  Its great that we don't have to hear the big hits recorded in concert from a huge venue done in the context of a world tour.  For the most part, these are almost like studio recordings (in fact at least one of the tracks was done in studio).  And it was great to finally hear favorites like &quot;The Spider and The Fly&quot;, &quot;Dead Flowers&quot;, and &quot;I'm Free&quot; done live, and then closing with Willie Dixon's &quot;Little Baby&quot;.  A very pleasant surprise indeed.
B00005QK3W|4.0|Paul McCartney's Driving Rain is his first album of all new material since 1997, and while it may not be as &quot;coherent&quot; and thoughtful as Flaming Pie, it still manages to pull together his 2 polar opposite personalities: rocker and balladeer.<br />The album kicks off on a high note with the growling, moody &quot;Lonely Road,&quot; then moves to the introspective &quot;From a Lover to a Friend.&quot; One the simplest, and yet most interesting, songs on the album is &quot;She's Given Up Talking,&quot; with its echo-drenched vocals and jangly guitars. It is also one of the few songs on the album that could be considered less than optimistic.<br />Nearly every song on the album has a message of hope and positivity, this even showing in the titles like &quot;Back in the Sunshine Again&quot; and &quot;Rinse the Raindrops.&quot; The latter, an experimental 10 minute jam, is one of the most interesting on the disc.<br />But the ballads, as usual, manage to steal the show. &quot;Heather&quot; is a free and easy instrumental, with just a few words tacked on at the end, that is instantly memorable. &quot;I Do&quot; sounds could have made it onto Flaming Pie, while &quot;Magic&quot; is a heartfelt memory of the night Sir Paul met his late wife of nearly 30 years, Linda.<br />There are a few tracks that don't have that spark, though. One of 2 compositions written with son James, &quot;Spinning On An Axis&quot; is rather unfulfilling (though it doesn't deserve the slamming that several critics gave it). &quot;About You&quot; is a rollicking rocker that doesn't do much. &quot;Your Way&quot; has an interesting country flavour, but not much else.<br />The most Beatle-y track on the CD is more reminiscent of George Harrison's work in the latter years of the band -- &quot;Riding Into Jaipur&quot; is drenched in sitars and Indian instruments, giving it a very nifty effect.<br />All in all, Driving Rain isn't one of Sir Paul's most cohesive efforts, but it does manage to raisea smile. Even a 59 year-old man can make this 15 year-old grin every once in awhile.  ;)
B00005QDW5|5.0|I'm not a Pink Floyd fan and don't have any of their CDs but was exposed to them (who wasn't) as someone who grew up in the 1970's and 1980's.  After a detailed listen of both discs, I felt the Echoes compilation was great.  I enjoyed hearing songs that I hadn't heard in years, particularly &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;, the band's tribute to former frontman Syd Barrett, who was unable to enjoy the post-Dark Side of the Moon success of Pink Floyd.  I am also of the school where I usually like compilations to be arranged chronologically, but that doesn't suit Pink Floyd at all.  Instead, the songs are sort of strung together in a large song cycle like the band's classic LPs.  Purists will probably gripe that some songs -- mainly &quot;Echoes&quot; but also others -- have been edited, but the arrangement works for the most part.  The songs lean on the band's prime recordings of the 1970's but the 1960's and 1980's are also represented well.  I was particularly glad that &quot;Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun&quot; made the cut.  The only songs that to me seemed out of place was &quot;The Fletcher Memorial Home&quot;.  There are probably a half-dozen or so songs that could have been used in its place, such as something from one of PF's two &quot;soundtrack&quot; albums that predate 'Dark Side'.  That being said, I am looking forward to more listens.

Tim Curry displays a delightful romp as the sweet Transexual from Transylvania. also one of the best Susan Serandon, plus the fact that richard O'brian Who wrote the script and played Riff Raff.<BR>by my standards one of the best movies ever made.<BR>if you haven't ever seen this movie you should buy it today.
B000002MG1|4.0|This album, while not the monster hit that it was in Britain, where it stayed on the charts for 151 consecutive weeks-a new record-and spawned 5 Top 40 singles, was among the band's most successful in the US and generally regarded as their best Warner Bros-era record.  That it was released only 18 months after their chart-topping &quot;Out Of Time&quot; makes it even more remarkable.  It is a meloncholy, contemplative pop album that is a distinct change of pace from most of their earlier work.  Even the &quot;rockers&quot; in this ballad-heavy album are slow.  It makes for a great listen that gets better with each spin.  The highlights are the hits &quot;Drive&quot;, &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot;, and &quot;Nightswimming&quot;.  &quot;Try Not to Breathe&quot; and &quot;Man on the Moon&quot; are also very good.<BR>     This album was influential in showing that they had a darker, more serious side to themselves.  All in all, a very deep, satisfying album.
B00005Q66T|4.0|Madonna's die-hard fans may find little reason to pick this up--after all, there are no new tracks on this retrospective--but it is still an essential companion to Madonna's 22-million selling THE IMMACULATE COLLECTION.<br />GHV2 bundles Madonna's biggest hits of the last decade (Music, Take a Bow, Frozen, Ray of Light, Beautiful Stranger, Don't Tell Me, Secret, Erotica, Deeper and Deeper, The Power of Goodbye) along with her personal and critical (read: fan) favorites (Drowned World, Human Nature, Bedtime Story, What it feels like for a girl). They may not have the gobal impact M's 80s hits had, but they are still great memorable songs.<br />Oddly though, YOU'LL SEE, RAIN and I'LL REMEMBER were excluded from this collection. I guess WB smartly left them off to encourage purchase of M's 1995 ballads retrospective, SOMETHING TO REMEMBER.<br />Of course, some fans will quibble about the edits and versions used, the non-sequential tracklisting but no matter. GHV2 perfectly encapsulates Madonna's passion and commitment to producing music that is challenging, progressive and most importantly, enjoyable. Pop music at its absolute finest.
B00005QK3W|4.0|There are a handful of cats that I'm always willing to hear, even if I expect to be disappointed.  McCartney is one of them.  I was hesitant to go out and buy this CD, especially after watching the Concert for NY; I liked the concert, but I thought his contribution was generally weak.  I kind of liked 'Freedom', but the other tunes I thought were too personal for that venue, and it appeared to be more self-promotional than anything.  I went ahead and got the CD and I was pleasantly surprised.  It seems more complete in it's entirety than many of his previous solo efforts.  It is highly personal, and the bulk of the songs are love songs, but they are almost all very well crafted.  He seems energized, his arrangements are interesting, and the band makes for interesting chemistry.  'Your Way' is a nice little ditty, reminds me of 'Heart of the Country'; 'Tiny Bubble' is cool and reminds me of good '70s Motown; 'Spinning On An Axis' reminds me of some quirky old Wings stuff; 'Driving Rain' reminds me of REM's 'Happy Shiny People'; 'Heather' and 'Riding Into Jaipur' are both captivating pieces, and both lean on lyrics.  The former reminds me of a Burt Bacharach tune (I'm sure that'll turn some of you off).  By the way, don't buy the CD if you want heavy lyrics; instead, go get some Zevon, Newman, or Dylan.  All in all it's vintage McCartney, but MUCH better than most of his more recent efforts!
B00005R2M3|4.0|Just got this CD yesterday and it's quite awesome.  It does have some problems.  The one song I could do without is Eyes Like Yours.  Ojos Asi was an awesome song but the translation to English just doesn't seem to fit the music.  However, the rest of the songs I love.
0385505833|4.0|Skipping Christmas? Sounds mystical to me. I was thinking, when I saw the title of this book, that the couple was about to deny there's even Christmas or something, only to later discover that Grisham purposed the couple to merely go on a holiday.<br /><br />Pretty much an American culture to stay home, throw parties and go to attend Church services for Christmases. Here in Singapore, there's a totally different perspective; people in fact deliberately go on a vacation on Christmas! Thanks to this book, I have got closer to the American culture.br&gt;<br />Unlike other Grisham novels (and thrillers), which are usually about law, legislation and ligitious America, he seems to have become a little more humorous and homely here. Characters are fashioned to interact in such a close-to-the-heart manner, which easily compels a reader to believe in this story (besides notion that skipping-Christmas-is-wrong bit).<br /><br />Not a typical page turner though, and the I would say that the climax of the story is pretty gentle and not at all dramatic as one would expect a Grisham story to be so.<br /><br />One great regret: The book is paced real slow, almost to a crawl in the first 100 pages when similar anecdotal episodes in the lives of the Kranks get repeated umpteenth time, and bound to drive everyone to sleep with a not-again complaint. But the story picks up pretty well at the end, and pretty unpredictable too.<br /><br />If you think of buying this this Christmas for someone contemplating to skip Christmas 2001, attach a personal note to it and it might be a little more effective. Christmas is never too often, and you would appreciate it if you live in Singapore where Christmases are in actual fact a shopping festival. :o(
B00003CXCQ|3.0|Kind of boring.  My daughter loses interest after a few minuts as well. They could have done a better job. I don't care how many people feel this is the best DVD going, I dont' care too much for it, neither does my daughter, and it is all about the kids. She gets scared of the mirror. I can't blame her. If I was close to 5, I'd be scared too. They could have done more with this DVD, but they chose not to. I'd think twice before buying it again, but it is opened so it is obviously staying with us. Maybe when she's older she'll enjoy it. I actually fell asleep while watching it, so it's great if you need some rest.
B00005Q66T|4.0|OK, let me start off by reminding everyone that Madonna is the GREATEST diva of all time and that she only keeps getting better as time goes by. This cd just proves how amazing she truly is. However, a HUGE Madonna fan like myself will notice several flaws on this cd. I will begin with the flaws because there's not too much to say about how great this cd is. It truly speaks for itself. The flaws begin with many of the songs. Sadly for some reason, they are almost all edited. Cut short from the original versions. I am not sure why, but for someone like me, it is a minor annoyance. One perfect example is Human Nature where she used to say, &quot;I'm not your b*tch, don't hang your sh*t on me&quot;. That line, which was repeated many times in the original version, isn't in this version at all which kinda makes another line in the song &quot;express yourself, don't repress yourself&quot; seem kind of hypocritical. Besides the editing of many songs, alot of her greatest hits are missing. A few of these hits are : Love Don't Live Here Anymore, Rain, I'll Remember, This Used To Be My Playground, This Time, You Must Love Me, American Pie, Nothing Really Matters, etc. I'm not sure why they don't appear on this cd, but they don't and are one of its minor flaws. Other than the edits and missing songs, this cd is all around perfect. A great refection of an incredible artist who's career was just as bright in the 90's and 2000's as it was in the 80's when she began. I recommend this cd for every Madonna fan who still, like me, wanna strike a pose! lol
0393317552|4.0|When I first began to read this book, I was so intimidated by the advanced wording and content I almost gave it up. I didn't, though, and ended up really enjoying it. <br />Why are societies today the way they are--some very advanced, others not much different from where they were millennia ago? Why were these advanced civilizations able to conquer more disadvantaged ones? What causes some countries to be disadvantaged in the first place? This book will answer these questions and more. <br />So keep reading!! It might be hard going in the first few chapters, as I said, but it's really worth the effort to read. <BR>Highly recommended.
B00005OM4N|5.0|This cd is amazing. I bought it the first day it came out and fell in love with it the first listen. Despite what people say about Britney, this cd really proves to everyone that not only is she growing up, but she's also improving artistically. The songs on this cd are very creative and very original. Whether it's playing to a background of futuristic dance music or to the soft melodies in her ballads, the lyrics all have an underlining tone that just like me and you, she's everything and she's nothing at all ... stuck between woman and girl, stuck between adult and child, stuck between confusion and knowing exactly what she wants. Critics and haters may write this off as another piece of bubble gum pop, but it only takes one listen to know that things are changing for her and her music. There's a depth to this cd if you can find it. I think I have and thats why i love it. This is a must have for every mad Britney fan like myself and for everyone else, you may be surprised to find yourself enjoying a new and improved WOMAN.
B0000584V3|5.0|This Swedish Band is just great. Blackwater Park is one of the most impressive metal albums I've heard. Sound is very rich, heavy with a lot of stuff going on. Same guy sings in straight and Death Metal like vocals, which is very surprising sometimes. It's very hard to determine genre of the music. Mostly it's like death, but with a lot of acoustic guitars, straight singing, even elements of blues and jazz are present. So it may take couple times to get into the band, but it grows on you  lot. Buy it!!! Highly Recommended!!!

0440224764|1.0|(...)I did not like this book. I read and enjoyed \\"The Firm\\", but this one is nowhere near as good.(...)<br />This is quite simply bad writing. The book starts well, with a man on the run finally being caught, but even as his captors start torturing him to find where he hid the $90 million, his friends are moving to help him. There is tension, there is excitement, there is a beautiful woman. Who will get to Patrick first? But after that it's all downhill. 1) Grisham cannot sustain suspense. Far too many pages are taken up explainig how things were done when the reader already knows the outcome. No tension at all! 2) Grisham does not seem to understand the narrative function of dialogue versus narrative. He merely uses dialogue when 2 or more characters are talking to each other! His dialogue is sometimes almost good - we get some wit and cut and thrust, which is almost totally absent in the narrative - but mostly it's very humdrum. 3) The ending is poor because it is almost completely unprepared. A good ending can shock, but the reader should be able to look back in the narrative and find clues that prepare for it. I only found 2 and they are very weak. 4) Grisham is too thorough, like his protagonist who has everything planned. The only tension left is to find out what really happened and how he did it. And this is explained in painstaking and boring detail. For example, Grisham spends several pages first telling the real story of who (or what) was burned in his car \\"accident\\", THEN drags us through the whole business of contacting the relatives and digging up the coffin and opening it to find... exactly what we knew was in there all along! No guessing necessary. Patrick refuses to reveal the name of the dead person, but this is description of a legal tactic; it provides no narrative tension because the reader already knows! \\"They left Biloxi in Sandy's Lexus\\". Who gives a *** about the brand of car? It plays absolutely no role whatever in the story. All it does is say, \\"See? Characters in my book are rich and successful! When they make the movie, this should be a clue to the director!\\" Poor editing. In one scene in which a female (sexist stereotyping) takes notes of a meeting, Grisham explains to the reader that the note-takers in the previous meeting were now unavailable because they had gone back to headquarters. Who cares? This is just anal attention to pointless detail, realistic maybe, but narratively meaningless!<br />5) The characters are not developed at all, they are all just 2-dimensional, even the protagonist. The main female lead, Eva, has been desribed as \\"the love interest\\", but there is almost no tenderness or real expression of love in the whole novel at all! Patrick is clearly a control-freak who is so into faultless planning (which becomes the focus of the book) that he has no time left for any finer feelings, or even any feelings at all, except a few trite \\"I love yous\\". Grisham grossly neglected the fun part of the whole deal. Compare \\"The Girl, the Gold Watch, and everything\\".<br />Booring! A very thorough and clever story by a writer very familiar with the legal world. But a THRILLER?!?? NO WAY! Grisham should take lessons from Agatha Christie.say, \\"See?

0385505833|3.0|Not since his sophomore outing, &quot;The Pelican Brief,&quot; has John Grisham served up as slight or film-adaptable offering as &quot;Skipping Christmas.&quot;<br />The book is more a novella than a novel, weighing in at a swift but enjoyable to read 176 pages. The author uses our familiarity with the hustle and bustle of the season and the nagging suburbon sterotypes to good effect in telling a tale of a couple, the Kranks, who plan to skip Christmas and take a 10-day cruise instead.<br />One can see Steve Martin and Sigourney Weaver slipping snugley into the roles of the 50-something Luther and Nora Krank, with, say, John Hughes or Chris Columbus manning the directorial chair. Katie Holems would be excellent as the Kranks' daughter Blair, who joins the Peace Corps and leaves for Peru the weekend following Thanksgiving.<br />The bulk of the novel deals with Luther and Nora's plight as they deal with disenchanted neighbors, friends and aquaintances, who can't believe the Kranks, long known for their must-attend Christmas Eve party, will not do Christmas this year.s<br />With the right screen adaption and direction, the story, with its numberous ironic scenes, slapstic climas and sentimental ending, would make an excellent screw-ball comedy in the vein of Capra classic &quot;You Can't Take It With You.&quot;<br />The novel's not a classic, but it is a fun read.
B000058T5E|5.0|Beautiful album. JB has been rocking my world for over 30 years. The man has great style. He's awesome. <BR>I buy all of his albums instinctively. <br />My favorite tracks :  3)Dirty Mind 5)Nadia  and 6) Loose Cannon<br />I like this better than Who Else? but Who Else? is a great album... it still deserves nothing less than 5 stars. No question in my mind whatsoever.

B00005QK3W|1.0|This CD is the biggest disappointment I've ever gotten from Paul McCartney.  Sure, there have other less than stellar efforts, but they usually had some saving grace - some small gem from one of the greatest songwriters ever.  And his sometimes embarrassing lyrics have been saved by gorgeous melodies.  Not here.<br />The songs are almost totally uninteresting melodically, and the lyrics are the worst. For example, &quot;Driving Rain&quot; begins with &quot;12345 Let's go for a drive&quot; and goes downhill from there.<BR>Lyrics on many of the others are sappy tributes to the new love he has found, but she and the listener deserve better.<br />Take a pass on this one and buy &quot;Run Devil Run&quot; or &quot;Wingspan&quot; instead.
B00005RHGK|4.0|Come on.  The movie was great and the plot was excellent but the ending (...) blew.  There was no ending.  The company will make a lot of mone off this movie becasue they have to have a sequal so everyone who saw it the first time will crawl back to the theatre wanting to know what happen next.  Other than that the movie was spectacular.

B00005R2M3|5.0|Let me get out of the way several aspects I have NO concern about, that being an artist's crossover aspirations and what language they sing in.  None of that matters as long as the music itself demonstrates heart, soul, and ambition.  As for Shakira, I'm a fan of her last two albums, and find that her artistic vision on LAUNDRY SERVICE has in no way been sidetracked by the words &quot;crossover&quot; or &quot;language&quot;...in fact, she seems to be solidly moving forward as an artist!<br />Shakira's voice is passionate and original (NOT an Alanis clone!), her lyrics are intriguing, and the song arrangements continue to balance rock, pop, dance, soul, and the subtle regional touches that one would expect by an artist born in Columbia.  The songs are mostly brand new, although there is an English version of my all-time favorite Shakira track &quot;Ojos Asi&quot; (titled &quot;Eyes Like Yours&quot;), and two versions of the wonderful track &quot;Suerte.&quot;  <br />Contrary to another review, I see absolutely NO sign that Shakira has in any way compromised her music with teen-pop (or any other insincere) elements to appeal to a certain audience.  The one way that she is widening her audience--by singing primarily in English--hasn't preoccupied her from building on the strengths of her past albums.  In any language, Shakira is a true original!
B000002UAR|5.0|This album is one the best beatles and greatest ever, it is just a killer, the lyrics in it are great, she said she said is just a song that you know only john could have wrote, and eleanor riby is pauls baby that is a killer<BR>taxman is a great song by george<BR>and here there and everywhere is a killer it just shows you how good they were<BR>and got to get you into my life is pure beatles greatness<BR>and then tomorrow never knows is all john with alittle help from drugs but its ok<BR>and for no one is a great little song
B00005OAJ1|3.0|This is a really strange effort. The arranements and music are very well done and sometimes heartbreakingly beautiful but the lyrics are so damn ranchy that it is unbelievable. This is one of the smoothest, parody albums I've ever heard. A parody of what?  A parody of all the sorry, PR-aware musical productions that abound on almost every major label. Want to see some more breasts with tattoos and pierced body parts? Yeah, right. <BR>This is not for your average dumb listener who would take this music seriously and would not get the joke however, so I would leave this album unrated if Amazon would allow it and with a warning. listener Beware.
B00005QK3W|5.0|If you listen to the entire album through you will notice, that the songs are all different in ways, i think he was really doing some good post-beatles work here, when you listen to &quot;from a lover to a friend&quot; you here something that said that john was there with him during the writing of it, and freedom is just of the best songs he has ever made that was post-beatles, and its sorta like pauls own &quot;give peace a chance&quot; <BR>go and buy the cd because it is some great music and will make you understand why he is the greatest song writer alive and ever

B00004TLN3|1.0|I can't wait for this short 2-hour movie to end because it was so badly acted! Compare this to the 6-hour movie-thon I spent watching Colin Firth &amp; Jennifer Ehle in P&amp;P and did not want it to end! I have read the book twice and found the movie too flippant - no justice to Jane Austen's writing. The portrayal of Catherine's nightmares were unecessary and silly and took away valuable minutes that should have been better spent building up the characters. Good thing I do not own this!
B00005Q66T|5.0|For quite some time I have anticipated what form a second Madonna hits collection may take. 'The Immaculate Collection' is without doubt one of the finest compilations of all time. Creating a worthy second volume would be no easy task. In the years since, Madonna has produced some of her finest music. But it has undoubtably been a difficult period. She has experimented with so many musical styles to varying degrees of critical and commercial success, that it is hard to collect all the highlights on one satisfying and cohesive album. Inevitably there were going to be many omissions, but that was the same with 'The Immaculate Collection', and few would argue this album failed to capture Madonna's first period of recording effectively.<br />The main problem is finding a way of putting songs as different as 'Don't Cry For Me Argentina' and 'Ray Of Light' together without the finished product sounding contrived. It is also difficult to strike a balance between the slower and mid tempo songs which provided the bulk of Madonna's hits in the early/mid 90s and the more uptempo dance oriented successes of the late 90s/00s. For the most part, the GHV2 formula works. It include the early more uptempo, less commercially successful hits, such as 'Human Nature' and 'Bedtime Story' at the expense of the more successful/down tempo 'You'll See' &amp; 'I'll Remember'. This allows for the inclusion of later more laid back recordings such as 'Drowned World/Substitute For Love', without the whole album sounding too laden with ballads.<br />The first part of the album contains hits from 'Erotica' and 'Bedtime Stories', beginning with early 90s dancefloor classic 'Deeper and Deeper', which reminds the listener of the kind of song that made Madonna famous in the first place, with its pop/dance sensibilities and strong hooks. 'Erotica', which sparked the early 90s Madonna backlash, still sounds as edgy and interesting as when it first arrived, while the r&amp;b inflected 'Secret' with its infectious chorus and simple yet highly effective melody is surely one of Madonna's finest songs. Juxtaposing this with the musical bombast of 'Don't Cry For Me Argentina' does the latter no favours, although it does showcase Madonna's newly developed vocal range to great effect. Placing the sweet, string led ballad 'Take A Bow', another of her finest recordings in between would have worked better.<br />The Bjork penned 'Bedtime Story', which marked Madonna's first foray into electronica, leads into the songs which have restored Madonna's image and established her at the forefront of contempory pop/dance music. Often cited by critics as one of Madonna's poorer songs, 'Bedtime Story' with Nellee Hooper's Massive Attack style production and a soft, chilled out vocal, sounds effective in this context, preceding the lush electronic landscapes of 'The Power Of Good-Bye'. With its heartfelt lyrics, lilting melody, soft guitars and sense of drama, this is perhaps the ultimate Madonna ballad. The amazingly dramatic and intricate soundscapes of 'Frozen' lose some of their impact in the setting of this album, but act as a reminder of how Madonna's incredible re-incarnation of the past four years began. <br />'Ray Of Light' still sounds the exhilarating pop/dance masterpiece it always was, with one of Madonna's finest vocals to date threaded through a relentless ride of guitars, beats and William Orbit's deft electronic touches. Following this is another masterpiece, and Madonna's most original composition to date, the dance/pop/country hybrid 'Don't Tell Me'. <br />The album closes with two landmark Madonna songs. 'Drowned World/Substitute For Love' features her finest, most heartfelt and revealing lyrics to date as she dispels the myths surrounding her fame to elegant, ambient production from Orbit. It shows Madonna coming full circle and renouncing the outrageous megastar lifestyle which she appeared to crave at the beginning of the 90s, where this collection picks up the story. The final song could only be 'Music', her outrageously funky celebration of the power of music, which echoes the dancefloor abandon of 'Into The Groove', setting it within the context of the modern dance sound which she has made her own.<br />GHV2 is a fitting monument to Madonna's musical achievements of the past decade. The first third of the album, despite containing some fine songs, does sound rather patchy but only in comparison with the direction and confidence of the final two thirds. Madonna is the queen of pop. She has the ability to create fine pop songs which make an artistic statement, while  still having the commercial appeal to reach a mass audience. From here she looks untouchable.
B000008H1R|4.0|My first exposure to Jethro Tull was this album way back in late 1970. I was hooked from the get go by the first two songs, &quot;With You There To Help Me&quot; and &quot;Nothing To Say&quot;. Soon after, I added &quot;Stand Up&quot; to my collection. &quot;Benefit&quot; is more straight ahead Rock than &quot;Stand Up&quot;, but not quite up to it as a whole, and not quite as good as &quot;Aqualung&quot;, which got overplayed by commercial radio to the point of annoyance. There's not a really weak track here, just some that are head and shoulders above the others. The first 6 tracks are my favorites, though I do really like &quot;Teacher&quot;, which is another song that repetitive commercial radio ruined for me. The playing is brilliant without the over production that marred later works. Martin Barre really steps out here into Rock guitar hero status.<br />This is essential work from Ian and the band, along with their first two albums, &quot;Aqualung&quot; and &quot;Thick As A Brick&quot;.......
0451191153|5.0|Being a young man (17) I think I have the bennifet of taking a more naive view of this book.  It is, to put it simply, the best book Ive ever read, and I have a wide range of classic literature on my shelf.  Many single &quot;star&quot;, critical reviews of this book seem to dwell on Rand's philosophy, not the book itself.  I dont understand why I have had to read peoples rants about her personal life or Objectivism.  That is not the point.  I'll admit her philosopy and personal beliefs are being sold within the books covers, (quite well, might I add, even thought I disagree with them) but once you can get past that you will realize what a great piece of fiction this is.  Another complaint is how unbelieveable the story and its characters are.  Rand over does it this way to emphasise her Objectivism beliefs.  Sort of like a characature, substatuting the person for an ideal.  It's a bit over done at times, but, in my opinion, never really got in the way of the story.  The length was yet another issue.  I found it perfect.  600 would have been too short and 800 a little too long.  I was actually a little sad when I finished.  I had become so accoustomed to Roarks character it was like losing a friend when I was done.  This proves Rand as a writer as far as Im concerned.  Her characters, although sometimes utterly unlikable, are always interresting.  She creates an entire world, then draws you in completely.  I enjoyed the book immensly and could care less about her political ideas or her personal life.  She gave me this amazing book that, for the duration I was reading it, made me smile, sneer, cringe, gag and feel passionatly about something.  And isn't that what reading is supposed to be all about: Enjoyment?

It is THIS cd that has made me a Radiohead fan, not their past recordings. In fact, I never really listened to them before &quot;Amnesiac&quot; and when I went back and listened to &quot;The Bends&quot; it sounded pretty much like run-of-the-mill, mid-90s alternative music borrowing heavily from U2. Musicians and artists should be constantly evolving and redefining themselves (can you say, The Beatles or Miles Davis?). Heaven forbid they find a comfortable rut like R.E.M. and release the same album over and over again, as it seems like some of their fans here wish that they would do.
B00005QXXO|5.0|I've been a fan of Radiohead for years but truly fell in love with them with the arrival of Kid A, and later Amnesiac. I saw them perform in Atlanta this past summer and I almost couldn't believe my ears: they played like boys fascinated with a new toy, discovering their creations all over again, making me discover their music all over again, too. I was pleasantly surprised to witness the sheer human joy for music that Thom Yorke and the band seemed to eminate on stage, which one might not expect after hearing their beautiful yet distant studio recordings. This CD brings me back to that, with new twists on old favorites, especially &quot;Like Spinning Plates,&quot; which I enjoyed as a sort of avant-garde personal mediation piece on Amnesiac, and now I love on this album as a stripped-down, heart-wrenching, human expression of love and frustration that fills the listener with absolute raw emotion. And it just gets better from there. This is a must-have for any reverent Radiohead listener!
B00005QHPQ|5.0|I slipped this CD into the player, turned up the volume, and felt like a teenager again!  Listening to this CD is like mixing a generous portion of the 80's rhythm driven Pop, with a little<BR>Melrose Place love technique, and adding a dash of High Velocity 'Erasure' Vocals.  You're gonna LUV this album.  <br />This is the CD born from Iglesias's heart, and the album he was given creative control over.  His love for the bewitching ballad and Pop heavy Refrain really shines through here.  The songs feel fresh and alive.  <br />I beleive this album not only shows he is a force to be reckoned with, but will demonstrate his ability to revitalize a Genre.  A deceptively simple Album with an addictive edge.
B00000IP3S|3.0|I really love the music in this album, and other BLIND GUARDIAN albums, by the way. BUt notice that I wrote &quot;the music&quot;. Because the vocals.... What amazes me mostly in German metal bands are the poor quality of their singers. They are, in most part, just annoying, trying to sound different. This is the case, unfortunately, in Blind Guardian, as is with Gamma Rays Kai Hansen, Grave Digger, Running Wild, even Scorpions has a lousy singer (Klaus Meine has charisma, but his voice is awful). More interesting yet, in most of these cases the awful singer is the leader songwriter of the band, what makes it impossible to replace the guy, because without the guy the band would never ever be created, in the first place!! Funny situation...!
B00005QIPH|5.0|The hype following a single single released in England made many people believe that The Strokes were going to save rock. Unfortunately, I don't believe that will happen. The album is just too intelligently beautiful for most and although I hope it is successful, I doubt it will become a big hit. Most people would rather waste their money on whiny Staind albums then buy something this refined. These privileged children of successful New York immigrants have almost refined the New York sound no other band has even came close to since the Beastie Boys. The Strokes, although highly successful in England have yet to find success on this side of the Atlantic.  That said, this album is hands down the best album I have bought all year. It begins with a delightful title song that sounds like a boy complaining to a girl over an apartment intercom. That is the coolest thing about lead singer Julian Casablancas' glorious voice. It does sound like its coming from an intercom, but it also has an extraordinary ability to change pitch at the drop of a pin. A high wailing instantly changes into a low loud rant, and then a calm choir-boy type singing. He isn't the best rock singer. He doesn't come close to Anthony Kiedas of Red Hot Chili Peppers, but his vocal range, and ability to change his voice is amazing. His lyrics aren't anything new. Troubles of chasing and being chased by beautiful New York girls would put poetry in anyone, and Casablancas privileged but slightly traumatic upbringing, (he's the son of a famous fashion model firm owner who he now barely talks to), certainly gave his lyrics a strange poetry. Sometimes the meaning is completely private. In one song he asks his girl why she doesn't wear her new trench coat. It doesn't matter what <BR>his private meanings are, only that he is willing to share the beauty of it with us. The music is also extremely amazing. From the singer to the drummer, each member of the Strokes takes each song from a completely different pointof view, and then mashes it together. Part of the reason it works so nicely is that there are two guitarists fusing their handiwork together. The bass and drums also add to the mishmash of every song. If grunge had been invented in the seventies it would probably sound a lot like the strokes. Imagine if you will a group that combines Pearl Jam, B.B. King, and Velvet Underground and maybe you can hear a little of the Strokes. Are The Strokes the band to revitalize rock? Maybe not, but they can probably keep rock on life support. There is a little hope in the Stokes.
B00000DHTF|5.0|Im not the first Bruce Springsteen fan around. I own only BORN TO RUN, THE RIVER and BORN IN THE USA, and Im pretty much satisfied with those records, they are really top notch. So, I understandably went very suspicious when I heard about this BOX set made of unreleased amterial more some B-sides. Anyway, I went for it. Guys, I must assure you with a clear coinscience: the material here has absolutely no fillers or throwaways !!! These are top-of-the-line songs, compared to some of the best in his regular discography!!! I enjoyed every little bit of the four CDs (including the tests for CBS, which features a very crude Springsteen and his guitar, playing solo). Magistral work, for die-hard or average fans.
B000035Z1Z|1.0|I wasn't expecting more than light entertainment, but I don't think the movie ever got going.  I thought Meg Ryan's character just never got to be sympathetic enough to make me want to see the two characters get together in the end.  I found all the anti-French jokes just painfully stupid.  The only great thing about the movie was seeing Jean Reno in a small role who does far greater acting with his facial expressions alone than anyone else in the whole movie is capable of.
B000009QPG|5.0|This is the best SLAYER album. Even with so much praise being given upon REIGN IN BLOOD, SEASONS... is better, simply because the players are more mature, the songs are well &quot;designed&quot;, the furious in the right proportion. I jus tlove this album, never imagined it could be so good. COming after SOUTH OF HEAVEN (another masterpiece), SEASONS portrays SLAYER at their definitive best.
B000002O3I|5.0|the combination of wolf's rip-roaring vocals and sumlin's crisp and searing guitar can NOT be ignored. this music is already 40+ years old? you gotta be kiddin me! still sounds as fresh today as it did back then. the recordings are a little raw, but i feel it actually adds to the power behind these songs. the first half of the cd is wolf's 2nd album from the late 50's/early 60's in chicago. the 2nd half of the cd is wolf's 1st album from his early 50's memphis days. this cd is a steal for the money, considering it has 24 tracks and represents wolf's best work. no one will ever be able to match the power and depth of wolf's vocals. sumlin was the perfect foil for wolf. his guitar playing is impressive and he gives wolf plenty of room to scare the wits out of everybody! this cd should be on your top 10 list if your building a blues collection.
B000002U82|3.0|THis is one of those albums that, it seems, youre not aloud to give a review that not be a five stars rating. But I dont care. For me, this is just another great Floyd album, but THE WALL and even THE FINAL CUT are better.
B00005R2M3|3.0|Frist of all, I'm not sure which album the first reviewer listened to when they said it was her best so far.  I love Shakira and I am a big fan.  I was intent on purchasing this album whether I liked it or not because I am a true fan.  And as a true fan I can honestly say this album is NOWHERE NEAR as good as her previous spanish albums.  There are some good moments on this CD, no argument there.  But for every song I listened to, I skipped over two.  Shakira has talent, loads of it.  I respect her decision to put out an english album.  I don't agree with her decision, but I respect it nonetheless.  However I just wish all the new fans she will be getting from this album would go back and get her older stuff.  That is the REAL Shakira at her best.  If you are a fan, buy this CD to show your support for her.  She is an incredibly gifted and downright genuine person.  If you've never heard of her before, go get her spanish CD's, even if you don't know spanish.  It transcends the language barrier.  God Bless you Shakira!
B00005R2M3|2.0|This is the long awaited  English CD from Shakira. Finalmente! The CD is a big let down; is more Ricky Martin and his kind than Shakira. Though, the CD boast that it was produced entirely by her, the sound and lyrics belies that.<BR>But, her voice does shines through and only that is worthwhile; and that is a big thing nonetheless.<BR>The English version of &quot;Ojos as&quot; is pathetic, is silly and it is quite obvious that the voice and the music don't go together.<BR>Es una gran pena, la musica es como la de Ricky Martin no suena como la autntica Shakira.
0425129616|5.0|In The Mysterious Affair at Styles, Poirot is at his most delightful, Hastings at his most cocky-turned-bumbling self, and the cast of characters the epitome of classic mystery. <br />The Mysterious Affair at Styles also proves that Christie knew from the start what made a mystery shocking and complex.  The plot structure is one of the more ingenious takes on mystery writing.  It is only second to that which was used in The Murder of Roger Ackroyd and Endless Night. <br />I can find nothing wrong with this book.  This is certainly a very good example of Golden Age mystery, it virtually defines the term.  A perfect example for those searching for Golden Age and all Christie/mystery lovers.
B00005R2M3|5.0|I have been eagerly anticipating the release of &quot;Laundry Service&quot; after I saw the video for the first single off the album &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot;. The song is one of those songs that grabs the listener by the jugular and doesn't let go until the song is over. I am constantly humming the melodies to the song because the melodies just sticks in the listener's head for as long as possible. My first introduction to Shakira was through her unplugged album but it was not until I heard &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; that truly convinced me as a fan. On &quot;Laundry Service&quot; the songs fuses pop, rock and dance with smidgeons of Shakira's Columbian roots. Asides from &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot;, my personal favorite tracks off this excellent album is the ballad &quot;Underneath Your Clothes&quot;, &quot;Te Dejo Madrid&quot;, and &quot;The One&quot;. I love the infectious melodies of this album and the powerful vocals of Shakira. A tremendous crossover effort by Shakira. She certainly stands apart from the glossy pop of Ricky Martin and Enrique Iglesias.
B00005NIDK|5.0|This isn't something to compare with past Yes albums.  That would miss the point of this one.  This is the future manifest.  This is the best of what Yes has become.  Just as you couldn't compare \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" with \\"Meet the Beatles\\", you can't compare this album with anything else that came before it.  Just let go and listen!<br />Yes has long been considered \\"The Musician's Band\\".  Well, fasten your seat belt.  The somehow-always-divinely-inspired voice of Jon Anderson has never sounded clearer or more precise; Alan's drumming and Chris' bass are razor-precise and in perfect synch; Steve's guitar playing stretches at last into less technical and more heartfelt territory; Jon's lyrics are rich and thought-provoking; and the writing and arranging are solid and interesting, directing each song to soar like a flaming arrow through a complex maze of cooperating and interrelated themes toward its intended mark.<br />And the orchestra!  This is not just another rock album with an orchestra pasted into the background for effect.  Larry Group&eacute;'s instrumentation is a seamless, integrated expression of some of the most absolutely brilliant, lyrical, rhythmic, perfectly mixed, and musical work in years, if not ever, and it expertly, perfectly helps to manifest the best of what Yes has become.<br />As is usual with their most brilliant, complex, and musically risky works, there's so much going on at once that a full apprehension of their sonic tapestry begins to make full sense only after a few dozen listens.  This may someday be considered the \\"Pet Sounds\\" of Yes.  It doesn't replace anything in their repertoire, but rather takes their music to new depth and height.  These are not tired old guys churning out a pop album sound-alike, but rather, fresh and energetic musicians at their creative peaks.<br />Let go and listen.  It's a fantastic ride.
B00005QK3W|4.0|Despite what 'Entertainment Weekly' may say about this cd, this is a great album. 'Flaming Pie' was really upbeat and fun and just wonderful with songs such as 'Flaming Pie', 'Young Boy', and 'Heaven on a Sunday', but this cd is very mixed. It seems like Paul has become very mixed actually. With upbeat songs such as 'Driving Rain' and then solemn songs like 'From A Lover to a Friend.' That Beatles edge is really seen in 'Driving Rain.' My favorite song on the album is 'Lonely Road', it's a great song. The whole album is very different, but very Paul, a good writing scheme of sounds. The album is great, but best of the year? No, but it's one of them, it has that classic rock feel also. Just let the good times roll, this may be the last of great music these days. I recommend indefinately, Paul go on tour!
B000002KDI|5.0|I am 30, and bought the vinyl, Live Rust, when I was 14 at a used record store.  It was cheap, so I took a chance.  I still vividly remember listening to the first side of album one, the acoustic stuff - After the Gold Rush, I am a child, etc - in my parents' den.  I was blown away by the beauty and expressiveness of Neil's songwriting, and am to this day.  In particular, Sugar Mountain takes me back to the times I went to Six Flags as a kid, and thought being on those rides and staying up til midnight was the best life could ever get.<br />In addition to the mellow songs, there are some louder, electric ones that are incredible as well, with Cinnamon Girl and Like a Hurricane being good examples.  This album definitely has the 'live' thing going for it, and when you hear these cuts you won't settle for the studio versions anymore - it's cool to hear Neil connect with the audience - &quot;When I get big, I'm gonna get an electric guitar.  When I get real big&quot;.<br />I kid you not - there is not a dud on the album.  It is just incredible, and capable of providing pleasure worth orders of magnitude more than its price.  I actually am typing this review because I would love to think someone bought this album as a result of it and enjoyed it as much as I have over the years (in CD format now, of course!)
B00005QIPH|4.0|It seems like a couple popular criticisms of the Strokes are that they've received so much hype and that they are highly derivative of the bands that influence them.  My opinion on that is who cares?  Is that a reason to not like the music?  Aren't there worse things than being influenced by great bands like Television, the Velvets, and the Stones?  It's not like the Strokes plagiarized other bands' songs...they were just influenced and inspired by other bands' work.  MOST bands are influenced by someone, and if you only listen to stuff that has no apparent influences, I'll bet most of it is unlistenable.  And why is it a bad thing for the Strokes to have received so much attention?  While I agree that they are not the most earthshattering band to come along in the past decade, I'm perfectly content to have their music shoved in my face by radio and MTV as opposed to the teeny-bopper fad.  I mean, even if you don't like the Strokes, wouldn't you agree about that?<br />Now as for the music - the Strokes' debut album is, in my opinion, nothing more than a good time.  Every song rumbles on at an energetic pace, almost every song has a catchy and fairly creative guitar line as its primary melody, and the vocals of Julian Casablancas have a (gasp!) Lou Reed-like swagger and arrogance to them that fit the music perfectly.  My favorite songs are probably SOMA, Someday, and Take It or Leave it.  However, all of the songs are pretty good - and that leads me to my only real criticism of the album..the songs are a little too similar to each other.  This quibble doesn't ruin this album for me, but I hope in future efforts, the Strokes show a little more diversity.  All in all, I enjoy this album because it just plain rocks.  It makes me want to bang my head or tap my toes a bit, and not much music today has that ability.  I would recommend to the skeptics out there who already hate the Strokes without even listening to them that you give them a chance.  Forget about the hype and forget that your friend told you they're rip off artists.  Just see if you enjoy it.  You might.
0425152251|2.0|This is not a novel; a teacher (the author Gaarder's former profession) opened up his lesson plan book, strung all the philosophy lessons together, added a tepid plot and a protagonist named Sophie, and, well, he somehow got a best-seller!<br />Gaarder must have been a FANTASTIC teacher, but he's a weak novelist. But I might give this book to an academically-inclined junior high schooler who likes to read, for it IS a very accessible introduction to the history of philosophy
6303695779|5.0|this movie is pure gustave moreau and pure surrealism! west's character watching himself being taken to the grave is, for some odd reason, absolutely terrifying, and although the movie becomes a little slow paced at times, this only adds to it's subtlety and admirable disdain for meaningless action. this is a horror film for real horror film fans, not sickos out to see gore and blood. even if the story is a little trite and utterly conventional as far as the vampire legend goes, buy it for the haunting and absolutely stunning imagery. there are scenes in this little gem that will stick out in your mind a long time after you view it.
0061040967|4.0|If you're new to the Discworld, then &quot;The Last Hero&quot; is not the place to start. Sure you can read and still enjoy it but you'll enjoy it even more if you already have some background knowledge of this wonderful fantasy world (like why is the Librarian an ape and how come the best lawyer in Ankh is a zombie?)<br />For those of us who have joined the roller coaster ride that is the Discworld novels, this coffee book production is must have if only for the great Kidby artwork. In fact, I think the book was more Paul Kidby's than Terry's.  The all-too-short story, it seems to me, played second fiddle to the visualisation of well known characters like Rincewind, Carrot and Cohen.<br />Saying that though, the tale isnt half bad. Old Cohen the Barbarian, last seen in &quot;Interesting Times&quot;, goes on a final big quest. He and his compatriots, the Silver Horde, may not survive the quest. Thats not the problem. The problem is Cohen's quest may cause the end of all life on the Disc. Enter Rincewind....<br />After growing up reading Disc books with cover art by Josh Kirby, its quite strange (but not much) to see a different version of well known characters. Rincewind as drawn by Kidby is younger and Carrot more handsome. The Librarian is...dare I say it?...cute and Ponder Stibbons looks like Harry Potter.<br /><br />But the most beautiful of all are the splash pages throughout the book. Great A'Tuin, City of Ankh-Morpork, the sea water dropping off the edge of the Disc, the Silver Horde with Cohen leading the charge....Simply eye candy par excellence!<br />Also, check out the 'Mona Lisa' in page 30. Better than the original HAHAHAHA!!<br />Finally, this is also the first Discworld novel that share the same cover in both UK and US. Usually, the US covers are just dead boring. How come they cant use the Josh Kirby covers for the American editions?? Too much red tape??
0440178002|5.0|I just couldn't put this book down! James Clavell is a good story-teller and does an excellent job of introducing one to a different time and culture. This book kept me on the edge of my seat and when i wasn't reading it, I was thinking about what had happened and what might happen next. When I finished it, I was disappointed that Clavell had not made it longer. This book has it all: intrigue, romance, action, and drama. Clavell does an excellent job of developing the different characters. As the reader, one gets a chance to see this new world through the point of view of many of these different points characters. An excellent read! Don't let the length scare you away. When you get done you'll be glad it was the length it was. I know I was.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I am being honest when I say he is the greatest of all time. He is 23 or 24 now and he already can play the guitar at the level of Stevie Ray Vaugh the sky is the limit for John Mayer. His song writing abilities easily surpasses Dave Matthews and Nike Drake. If there has ever been a album that is a must have Room For Squares and Inside Wants Out are a must. John Mayer's style is unique and unmatched, music can never be perfected but he is as close as you can get. I also want to suggest Chris Bryan and Howie Day these two guys need to be recognized for their talents!!!
B00005QK3W|4.0|&quot;Driving Rain&quot; is an interesting benchmark in Paul McCartney's career. &quot;Rain&quot; is the first full-length album of new material from McCartney since the death of his wife, Linda. At similar crossroads in his career,McCartney has delivered darker music with a rougher edge, usually a mix of the hard, blues-influenced rock he grew up with and his own penchant for experimentation.<br />Many of these songs offer Paul singing about loss, about loneliness, about putting the tatters of a life back together with the help of both the living and the dead. &quot;Lonely Road&quot; at first glance seems familiar territory, sort of an update of &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; but with a tinge of anger not present in the &quot;Let It Be&quot; voice.<br />Of all the songs, &quot;From a Lover to a Friend&quot; is perhaps the most interesting. One is tempted to interpret it as the voice of a widower begging his lost wife to let him go on with his life. That at some point in the past, the wife released him to continue on with his life, but the remnant of their love keeps him from committing himself to another relationship. At times, the music seems to be breaking down, like the singer, only to continue on. <br />This is even more apparent on the 10 minute &quot;Rinsing the Raindrops,&quot; a cacophonous jam that as much bespeaks power as chaos.<br />Musically, this album is much like &quot;Run Devil Run&quot; in that you get the impression of a band running through songs it has just now rehearsed, with the immediacy of a live performance. Paul's voice is also starting to show some age, with a few cracks in the high notes. But some of these make the listener wonder if emotion more than age made them happen. While one misses the polish of McCartney's previous offerings, one realizes after several minutes this is an intensely personal album, as personal as any McCartney has delivered. <br />The album ends with &quot;Freedom,&quot; Paul's instant anthem following theSept. 11 attacks. In a way, one expects this. It would be strange if McCartney allowed an album to end on any other note than an expectant, enthusiastic and positive one.

B00005Q66T|5.0|This is a great CD.  Every Madonna fan should own it.  Especially those that have played &quot;Immaculate Collection&quot; too many times.
B000000WF0|1.0|Like contemporaries Oasis, The Verve took advantage of the great brit-rock revival of the 90s, attempting to become to this new wave what the Beatles were to the original British Invasion. Judging by popularity, their success was second only to that of Oasis, but they achieved it at the cost of musical prostitution. Britain's pop in the 90s can be described thus: While Radiohead quitely and steadily pushed every boundary of alternative rock, while Blur displayed unparalleled songwriting abilities in every respectible genre of pop/rock, while Suede and Pulp started an exquisite Glam-revival -- Oasis and The Verve were busy dumbly immitating the image and basic sound of original british invasion (sampling where possible), at the same time reluctant to replicate its musical ingenuity. Void of vision but bloated with extravagance, these two bands capitalized on rock listeners who are either too young to know better, or too lazy to look further. Capturing the hype of illirerate and market-oriented critics, they managed at the same time to uphold the charade that they are in some way smart or progressive. My only hope is that history shall correct this foul error.
B00005QK3W|5.0|Paul has delivered (for the first time) three very strong CD's in a row. Flaming Pie (a very &quot;Beatle like&quot; collection),Run Devil Run (a return to his Rock &amp; Roll roots) and now Driving Rain (a very eclectic mix of music - very progressive for a man that will soon be 60!)<br />This CD takes a few listens to appreciate it's overall quality and variety. It is obvious that Paul enjoyed making this CD and it is a shame that he has no plans to tour to promote it.<br />Some fans may be turned off by several songs that are &quot;experimental&quot; and do not fit the &quot;3 minute&quot; format. However, with a CD that includes 16 (16!) tracks there is something for everyone to enjoy.<br />In time, I think this part of his career will be remembered as his best.<br />I highly recommend this CD.
0517122707|5.0|This novel is well-constructed and the prose made me thirsty for more and the antics made me guffaw.  Etc.<br />But I am sure that the experience of this book would be different were it not for the preface by Percy.  Maybe Percy is the author of the book.  Maybe O'Toole is the author of Percy.  Because the nice bittersweet story about the provenance of the novel at the beginning puts this ulterior sympathy in your head and also the expectation to find some inner sadness in the book.  Well, of course there is a kind of sadness in the book, if we evaluate Ignatius by our own standards, e.g., it's sad that he's fat.  Also it's at first depressing that Iggy has a problem with Modern Life.  But he only talks like he does.  Anyway, a claim:  this book has a romantic appeal owing to the preface.  We get slipped another, richer chracter with the (inner) travails of Iggy but who isn't so superficially exotic, and we endow Iggy with all the praeternatural vitality that a postmortem-vindicated imagination should have.  This doesn't vitiate the five-star rating, because, you get the preface too when you buy the book, right?
B0000025T6|5.0|I must start this review by saying that I'm not a Bruce Springsteen fan. His music just never grabbed me; however, this album is utterly incredible.<br />I consider Nebraska one of my top ten favorite albums of all time. Several of those slots are taken by hard-core eighties punk. Nebraska just fits in. It's raw; it's personal; it sings of family, of despair and longing; all the songs are intimately presented without any attempt at studio refinement. Springsteen paints a canvas of characters that the listener won't soon forget.<br />I doubt that too many bands/singers could succeed in this type of forum. I applaud this album.
B00005QK3W|5.0|McCartney is back in the saddle again.  This collection of new works brings Paul back to the forefront.  A bit eclectic, but it will rock your socks!!!  This production will be considered one of his best.
B00005QCVT|4.0|I would have to agree with Jeff Shannon, to watch this film more than once would be masochistic.All the actors are excellent in their roles and the 2 central characters, Harry(played by Jared Leto) and Marion( Jennifer Connelly) a drug addicted couple, bring forth the chilling realities of addiction,exploitation and self degradation to the point of discomfort.This film gives you the sensation of not wanting to see but having to.Connelly,as beautifull as ever seemed almost too pretty and I wondered why she took the role until I had thought about it after seeing the movie.This script would be hard to turn down for any serious young actress with her great talent. The story points out a very disturbing fact in our &quot;cozy&quot; little world:how one human being can so easily exploit,degrade and throughly de-humanize another when the situation arises.Again, for the open minded and stout of heart only,this film is a must see but it will stick with you for awhile.Very true to life,but takes it to the limit.
B00005QK3W|5.0|Paul is back in the saddle again.  This will eventually be rated as one of his best recordings.
B00000DCHI|5.0|Billy Joel is one of the greatest icons NYC has ever produced. <BR>This compilation is so massive that I need to divide my review for Volume 1 and for Volume 2. <br />My #1 favorite from Vol.1 is Scene From an Italian Restaurant.<BR>I like this song not only because of this song's dramatic development from calm to uptempo but because of his excellent pitch of storytelling. Moving Out is another of my top favorites this is a nice driving rock music with impressive stacattos and pianos. The Stranger was a major hit in Japan starting from impressive whistling. Just The Way You Are is one of my favorite Karaoke repertoires. Say Goodbye To Hollywood(live version) became huge hit in 1981 but it was originally from Turnstiles in 1976. Those who hasn't turned out to be huge hits are gems in its own rights. Captain Jack grows on me after repeated listens. The Entertainer is nice uptempo pop gem showing what he is. New York State Of Mind is nice night music fitting New York mood.<BR>Oops! Piano Man is standard piano flavored pop tune. <br />Part 2 of my review on Volume 2 will follow soon.

I wish that Miller had done a series about his career with the art by Mazzuccelli. It shows how he coped with the stress of running a department and not crossing the line and obeying your conscience.<br />I wish that there was a sequel written by Miller with year 2.  If memory serves it was done by another writer/artist team. I just hope the Dark Knight Strikes Back is just as good as Batman Year One and the Dark Knight.
0871137380|5.0|Never will another story of bravery and selfless acts stir me as this one did.  Reading the back cover, I was a little skeptical and boy was I in for a surprise.  This book, &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; conveys the meaning of being proud to be an American.  <br />The book tells the chilling account of the United States presence in the unstable region of Somali.  On October 3, 1993, U.S. soldiers are sent into the city of Mogadishu to continue an ongoing mission to rid the area of evil warlords.  The mission goes awry and instead of spending an hour in the city, they suffer severe casualties and are forced to spend a &quot;long and terrible night.&quot;  &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; relives the awful tragedy that went on during these days.<br />In my opinion, this book is incredible.  Mark Bowden gives an excellent and indepth look into the lives of the soldiers and this horrific incident.  Not only is this an excellent story, it illustrates true human emotion that could only be observed upon experiencing the actual events.  I could feel the realism with every turn of the page.  I suggest this book to everyone for it's message and educational background.
B00003CXTF|5.0|I think that was on the best movies that I have seen in long time.  Ben Affleck was SUPER in the movie.  Everyone needs to see the movie at least once.  It was good I saw it about 5 times.
B00005R2M3|5.0|Shakira's beautiful lyrics and robust voice combine to make her best album yet and some of the best latin pop out there!  I loved &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; from the first time I heard it, but her other songs are just as good.  If you want a CD that makes you want to burst out in song and dance, then this is the music for you.
B00005QXXO|5.0|It has always been the case that Radiohead is better live than in studio form (though the albums are great).  The IMBW live recordings don't come close to capturing the essence of the Radiohead live experience but they are as close as you are going to come short of actually buying tickets and attending a show.  I personally think the live versions of Kid A &amp; Amnesiac songs found here are superior to the versions found on the albums primarily because the band isn't able to tinker and overproduce them.  These live versions are rawer and much more immediate.  Plus, this live album has the first officially recorded version of one of Radiohead's best songs, True Love Waits.  Though I have bootleg versions of the song that I prefer, this is still a top version of a top song.
B000056K04|3.0|While I am a huge fan of DMB, I must say that \\"Everyday\\" is definetly not their best album. I would probably say that this is his worst yet. It is still good, but not as good as his old stuff. Dave has definately changed. I hope that he goes back to the old stuff. Do not just buy this this CD for \\"I Did It\\" and \\"The Space Between\\". They are probably the best songs on the CD. If you really want to listen to them, buy the singles. It is definately not worth ($). Unless you like Dave's new stlye, do not buy this album. Stick to the old stuff. You will thank me. If you want their best, go with \\"Crash\\".
B00005BJ2O|4.0|amazing film!amazing cast!amazing songs!BUT, where are this songs?:<BR>-Like a virgin<BR>-So exciting!It will last for 50 years<BR>-The show must go on<br />I think there is also another one missing.Well, that's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, because apart from that,it has all the songs as featured in the film.
B00005QXXO|5.0|My favorite band, putting out their first real live album? a dream come true. I saw radiohead this summer at the gorge, and it was a life changing experience. The most amazing concert i have ever been to. They have an amazing energy onstage, and this CD really captures that featuring some of their greatest new live songs, such as morning bell, dollars and cents, idioteque, and everything in its right place. It also features the previously unreleased track true love waits. This CD is just absoulutely amazing. Radiohead never fails to astonish my ears, i HIGHLY recommend it.
0345440757|1.0|Hyped by Random House publishers as  \\"this groundbreaking book,\\" readers are enticed by offers of \\"Tracy's Three Day Magic--how to change any and all bad habits (yours and the baby's) in just<BR>three days.\\"  Which mother would not be happy to \\"get baby to eat, play, and sleep on a schedule that will make every member of the household's life easier and happier?\\" The very unpredictability of babies is what makes new mothers' lives so chaotic. Mothers don't get coffee breaks, lunch breaks,<BR>or go off duty at 6pm. It is plain, hard work taking care of a baby.<br />Look in any bookstore or library and you will see pregnant women and new mothers searching eagerly for advice on child raising. I remember doing this myself, devouring every morsel. Think  how<BR>many editions of Dr. Spock's book  have been sold over the years! Fashions change in child rearing as in all things. We have gone from strict scheduling to permissiveness and now we are back to scheduling again. Tracy Hogg's \\"Secrets of The Baby Whisperer\\" is the latest in a long line of books purporting to know \\"the right answer\\" to parents' concerns. As any experienced  parent will tell you, there is no \\"right\\" answer. What works for one child will not necessarily work for another. Listening to your baby is the first step towards understanding him. <br />So who is this wonderworker who can tell instantly whether a baby is hungry, tired, in real distress, or just in need of a little TLC?<br />According to Newsweek magazine (...)(Feb 26, 2001 issue):<br />\\"A registered nurse in England, Hogg left her two daughters, then 8 and 11, with her mother and moved to L.A. in 1992.  Unable to use her nursing license here, she began taking care of babies.  She had, as they say in the movie industry \\"great word of mouth\\" and soon Hogg opened her own baby-equipment store in Encino, CA.  Her book and her Web site claim that she got a Master's degree in hypnotherapy from the University of California, Irvine.  But a University spokeswoman says they<BR>have no record of her.  Earlier, according to her book and Web site, Hogg was \\"assigned\\" to the Great Orman Street Children's Hospital,\\" an apparent reference to London's famed Great Orman<BR>Street Hospital, where she, in fact, attended a three-weekend-long training course.  And a \\"stint with the World Health Organization in India\\" turns out to refer to a  two-week trip she took there in 1989.\\"<br />This leads us to ask, how good is the advice she gives?<br />Not very.<br />Despite being endorsed by celebrities like Los Angeles stage actress Kate Mulligan who can afford $250.00 for \\"1 Hour Intense Consultation\\" or $350.00 for \\"Baby's First Feed,\\"  the information offered by Ms. Hogg is out of date and inaccurate. While she is entitled to her own personal opinions, they are not based on any scientific studies or research.  Moreover, much of her advice conflicts with that given by the American Academy of Pediatrics who advocate feeding babies when they indicate<BR>hunger  rather than on artificial schedules.    <br />Ms. Hogg's  theories on infant sleep are also unfounded.  They owe much to the teachings of Gary Ezzo, the discredited author of  \\"Babywise\\" and \\"Preparation for Parenting,\\" which have also been heavily criticized by the AAP.<br />Do we really need another parenting book that tells us that our instincts are useless and if we would only follow this author's theories all of our problems would be solved?<br />Rather, mothers - and fathers, too - are the real experts on their particular baby because they live with him 24 hours a day. What we really need are more books like  \\"The Baby Bond: How to Raise an Emotionally Healthy Child\\" by Dianna Hine and \\" The Baby Book: Everything You Need to Know about Your Baby from Birth to Age Two, \\" by Dr. William Sears and Martha Sears. These books help new parents to meet their baby's basic needs through a loving, nurturing, attachment style of parenting.<br />Norma Ritter, IBCLC<br />Norma Ritter,the mother of three grown children, (all breastfed,)is a Internationally Board Certified Lactation Consultant who has been helping mothers and babies for 24 yrs. She has a private practice,\\"Breastfeeding Matters,\\"  in upstate NY.
B00005QXXO|5.0|The recording is excelent both in performance and quality.  Powerful, emotional, and finally something major live from Radiohead.  If you liked the Kid A/Amnesia albums (who didn't) then this is the perfect companion.  A must purchase for fans.
B00005OM4N|5.0|I really don't understand why people keep putting Britney down, this album is really awesome!  It's fun &amp; it's funky!  Britney can sing &amp; she proves it here, listen to the vocals on I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman.  She has a lovely voice!  <br />If you are trying to decide whether or not to buy this album, it is worth your money.  Please don't listen to all of the negative things people say about her.  She is a delightful artist &amp; a delightful person.
B00005QHPQ|5.0|I´m a really fan of Enrique, and I have been waiting for this CD since the last one, I think is great, the music is always like him, is to bad that there is only three songs in spanish, but I think is awesome.The Song that I most like is &quot;Don´t turn off the light&quot; and &quot;hero&quot;, well actually I like all the CD.<br />Creo que este Cd es otra obra más de Enrique y su música no ha cambiado en nada a las de los otros CD. Es fantástico. Me fascina
B00003CX5P|2.0|I suppose I had figured the mythology of the first three Star Wars films(SW,ESB,ROTJ) all wrong. I thought that the major theme was \\"Power-Over vs. Power-Within.\\" I thought I had an understanding of what the makers of these films were trying to say. I guess I was wrong. Here are the basic points that I want to make:<br />1) In the Phantom Menace(PM), the cosmic war is CHRISTIANIZED, with Darth Maul looking like Satan! How incredibly shallow! Yeah, villians NEVER look like \\"normal\\" people in real life, right?! Please! Whatever happened to the concepts that really made you think, such as Luke going into the cave at Dagobah and understanding that what Luke saw as evil were really just components that he himself owned? <br />2) In the Empire Strikes Back, Yoda's home is on a planet that is nothing but a swamp which was meant to call your attention to the powers and mysteries of nature (where \\"the Force\\" comes from), but in the PM, Yoda lives on a planet that has wiped nature out and the Jedi reside in a Vatican-like Ivory Tower! I guess not EVERYONE has equal share of the force, just the SPECIAL HONOR SOCIETY ones do! <br />3) Anakin and his mother are Slaves on Tatooine, yet they live better than I do?!?!?! <br />4) Anakin yells \\"this is INTENSE!\\" while in the fighter at the end battle scenes. PLEEEZE! He also yells \\"YIPPEEEE\\" when his slavemaster lets him go home. Yeah, I really believe that these characters are so downtrodden by their lives as slaves. Lucas must have read \\"Roots\\" by Alex Haley before writing these characters (My eyes roll).<br />5) Lucas did not include any discussion about possible environmental/sociological/psychological elements making Anakin turn to the Dark Side. If Lucas did his research, he may have found that most tyrannical real-life despots come from majorly abusive or traumatizing childhoods. I guess Anakin's scars come from winning the Pod Race (My eyes roll again!). The storyline has a lesser social relevancy because of these dim-wittedcharacter sketches.<br />6) C-3PO was made by Darth Vader?!?!?!?!?!?!?! Imagine the odds!!!!!!<br />7) It is odd that with such a vast infinite number of galaxies, alot of what goes on in The Star Wars films take place on Tatooine!<br />8) Although the Star Wars films were nothing like the real-life war movies such as \\"Full Metal Jacket\\", they still had people getting tortured and killed in sometimes graphic scenes. Then all of a sudden, they decide to make these movies JUST FOR KIDS!?!?!?!?!?!?!?! <br />9) I thought that the two main Jedi (played by Neeson and that other guy who was supposed to be Obi-Wan) were a bit too MACHO! Right before they both do the lightsaber fight with Darth Maul, they see him in the hangar and say something like \\"Leave him to us!\\" Like the audience is supposed to say \\"Yeah, go get him! WOO HOO!!! KICK HIS DARK-SIDE BUTT\\" This is not in keeping with the original understanding of the Jedi. <br />Well, that is all I can say now. If I were to talk more, I would only collapse in pure tragic horror over this baleful film! (...)<br />It has been a year since I have seen the film.  I decided to watch it again so as to see if my critique was adequate.  I found, once again, that my review was quite on target in many ways (if I do say so myself).  There was one crucial aspect that I had alluded to, but still grossly overlooked.  Thanks to another review which further pointed this element out to me, I now see further evidence of this film's flimsy structure.  <BR>What I am refering to is the scene at the end of the lightsaber duel after Liam Neeson's character gets killed by Darth Maul.  Obi-Wan then kills Darth Maul out of REVENGE (not self-defense).  Knowing from ROTJ that striking your opponent down out of anger and revenge leads to the Dark Side, why didnt Obi-Wan become evil? This is something that 99% of the audience never questioned.  In fact, most of the audience thought of Obi-Wan as the hero after killing Darth Maul (and it surprises me that this is how Lucas wanted the audience to react, I suppose Overconfidence is George Lucas'es weakness.)<BR>So, Im sorry that many found my review to be unhelpful.  But these are people who I seriously DOUBT would be willing to actually discuss with me on an intellectual basis the EXTREME extent of how this film is flawed.  <br />Ok, I feel better now.

B000002O5L|5.0|Well, as many have said on here, this is a great albumn.  I ussually do not bother to take the time to review things on here unless their are less than ten reviews on a particular item. But this is one of my favorite albumns, so I had to do it. Once in awhile an artist will come out with an albumn that tops even their greatest hits albumn. &quot;Full Moon Fever&quot; is such an example. Every song on it is creative, catchy and captivating.  Not only is it my favorite Tom Petty albumns, but within my top 5 favorite albumns.  Listening to every song is both original and refreshing.  To solemn, sentimental songs like &quot;A Face in the Crowd&quot; and &quot;Alright For Now&quot; to upbeat rhythmic cuts like &quot;Zombie Zoo&quot; and &quot;A Mind with a Heart of its Own.&quot; Then of course you have the laid back classics of &quot;Free Fallin'&quot; and  &quot;Runnin' Down a Dream.&quot;  Whatever mood I am in, this albumn always hold enjoyment.  So, buy the CD, and let the music take you running on your dreams.
B00005OWIU|5.0|Love it, I love it! I read the book 10,000000 times already and I found the soundtracks are downright suitable with the story. I'm currently listening to #17 *turns the volume up,up and away!* most of you who doesn't have a good taste in ochestral (or something like that) music probably will say that the soundtrack (stunk). But honestly, some of the soundtracks gave me the chills, shivers, laughs and exclamations..<BR>Buy it, its worth it. <BR>I'm listening with the real player.
0688170528|5.0|So sad and depressing but this was one of the few books I've read that I literally could not put down and that made me cry.
B00004XOWM|3.0|Attmitedly this is not Limp Bizkit's best album by far, but there are some really good songs on here. For example Take a Look Around, It'll be Ok, My Way and Rollin'(Air raid vehicle) are all really good songs. The guitar parts are sweet and Fred Durst's singing is good.<br />There are also some bad, bad songs on this album. Like Livin' it up and The one. I did not like these songs at all. They don't appeal to me at all like My Way etc. did. I've got all of Limp Bizkit's albums and some of the best of their stuff is on this album but the worst stuff is on this album as well.<br />Overall I would say Its good, but not good enough. Some of the stupid songs will put many people off this album and maybe even Limp Bizkit completley, but if they listen on they will realise that this album isn't so bad and was worth the buy.
B00004WGAI|5.0|I read the novel this year in my 8th talent pool english class.  After finishing the book, my teacher let the class watch this version of the video.  I had really enjoyed the book, and couldn't wait to see a movie of it.  I'm glad this was the one we watched, it really helped me to get a better sense of the characters, story, time period, and everything.  From the very beginning, my eyes never left the screen.  I would encourage all fans of the novel to see this video.
B000050FEN|5.0|Frightning. This is the movie I hoped Silence of the lambs would be. In aworld where &quot;who dun it oh it was my best friend&quot; Murder mysteries abound Seven is a breath of fresh air. THe killer isn't some one you would never expect. It's someone you never expect to meet.The acting is surpurb. And it's a slasher film with out being exceedingly vilont. No fountin of blood sprinig from a paper cut. This Movie is sleek, slick and disturbing. It's also funny and deeply moving. The ending will shock you.
B000005RS6|5.0|Deep Purple set the standard for \\"live\\" rock `n' roll albums when it released Made In Japan in '72. Until then, live albums were considered gimmicks, mere souvenirs for fans of the artists. But Made In Japan paved the way for others as radio stations began playing the live versions instead of the studio versions of the same songs as sales of Made In Japan went through the roof. It proved to record company execs that live albums were viable, marketable forums for rock music.<br />With 1996's Live at the Olympia, Deep Purple has raised the bar for live recordings yet again. The addition of Steve Morse on guitar has revitalized a great band that was in dire danger of becoming stale and caricatures of what they once were.<br />This 2-CD set is an unedited account of the band's show at the Olympia in Paris. Gone are the interminable drum and organ solos and bombastic \\"LOOK AT ME!\\" guitar workouts. Instead, we have a crisp 17-song set that includes six tunes from the wonderfully eclectic Purpendicular album (Morse's first studio effort with the band) and shows the band to be having the time of its life ... and that is gleefully reflected in the performances. <br />With Ritchie Blackmore gone, the band was free to pick and chose material from its vast and impressive catalog of songs. Consequently, while we still have the umpteenth versions of \\"Smoke on the Water\\" and \\"Highway Star\\" here, gems such as the previously unreleased \\"When A Blind Man Cries\\" from the Machine Head sessions, and \\"Fireball\\" and \\"No One Came,\\" from the Fireball album make this a must-have for any Purple fan.<br />\\"Maybe I'm a Leo,\\" and \\"Pictures of Home,\\" two of my favorite numbers from Machine Head, get a rare inclusion in a live Deep Purple set here. Consequently, this live outing has a feeling of freshness and excitement, rather than that of an old `70s warhorse trying feebly to milk the very last penny from its glory years. <br />The band plays with renewed enthusiasm. Even \\"Smoke on the Water,\\" gets a fresh treatment thanks to Morse's incendiary playing. On this version, the song gets a beautiful piano coda tacked on to the end that is somewhat reminiscent of the ending of Eric Clapton's \\"Layla.\\"<br />This CD is truly a live album in that it is an entire show, from beginning to end, including all of Ian Gillan's inane banter between songs. He was dealing with a French audience that didn't understand much English, but his \\"Your fantastic! Superb! Supreme-o!\\" after every darn song gets kind of annoying after a while. However, when he's singing, Gillan sounds as good as ever, though age has taken some of his incredible range. (Don't look for \\"Child In Time,\\" in any of the live sets any time soon though, if you know what I mean.)<br />Morse is unbelievable. A true guitar virtuoso, he also appears to be totally ego-free. His presence has helped Deep Purple make two of the band's best albums, both, ironically, in the `90s. (Purpendicular and Abandon.) The live versions of the Purpendicular songs on this CD put many of the tunes in a whole new light. For example, \\"Cascades: I'm Not Your Lover,\\" was, in my opinion, one of the weaker songs from Purpendicular. However, here, the breathtaking 10-minute workout it's given pushes it to classic status. \\"Sometimes I Feel Like Screaming,\\" with its soaring signature guitar riff, sounds absolutely majestic here. However, \\"Ted the Mechanic,\\" one of the most popular tracks from Purpendicular, is given only perfunctory treatment.<br />So, let's review: the band sounds refreshed, renewed and enthusiastic and its reflected in the performances; the set thankfully lacks self-indulgent epic and pointless solos; the song selection is clever and daring. Addtionally, the quality of the recording is dead-on. It's crisp and unmuddled. When I turn it up loud and close my eyes, I swear I am right there in the auditorium pumping my fists with all the other ecstatic Parisians. I can practically smell `em!<br />This is an import CD, not readily available here in the U.S. because people are saving their money to buy the next Dave Matthews Band album. So, buy Live at the Olympia, '96 where and when you can find it. If you are a Deep Purple fan at all, you are going to weep with pleasure at this one!
B000002LLC|5.0|An all time classic. This album seems to have been overlooked and underrated, possibly due to the fact it is a soundtrack. Madonna sounds fantastic in this now quite old release. A brilliant piece of work that you will play over and over, it really grows on you.
6304493738|5.0|I saw this movie when it first came out on VHS about six years ago.  I wasn't particularly interested in watching a &quot;guy movie&quot;...gangsters, shooting, drug deals, whatever...but my boyfriend at the time wanted to see it.  I watched the first hour or so but eventually dozed off.  I woke up in time to see the unexpected ending, a literal jaw-dropping surprise.  Needless to say, I later watched the entire movie again (and again, and again).  It remains near the top of my list of all-time favorite movies.

B000059Z8J|4.0|Rather than a critique of the movie, which is fairly entertaining, but has some flaws, this review is based mostly on the quality of the DVD.  Christopher Reeve, Gene Hackman, Marlon Brando, and Ned Beatty are enjoyable in this film, and worth watching.<br />Surprisingly clean, the careful transfer of this 23 year-old film to DVD is a lovely sight. The Dolby 5.1 audio track sings, and the music of John Williams, featured by itself on one of the audio tracks, is as powerful as the main character.<BR>There are plenty of additional features to enjoy, including screen tests, special effects tests, and an enjoyable commentary throughout by director Richard Donner.  <br />The movie has some shortcomings- Margot Kidder was roundly criticized for playing Lois Lane, as one reviewer wrote in 1978, &quot;like a reformed hooker.&quot; But this movie has become an icon, and this DVD provides a clear (almost X-ray vision) look at an American classic.
6303114946|5.0|&quot;You have a good heart, and that's all that matters.&quot;  This line comes from his mom (Joan Allen) soon into this wonderful film about chess genius, Josh Waitzkin.  He does have a wonderful heart, but he also has this poetically innate mind for chess.  Chess is art. And Josh is this 7 year old artist who also plays baseball and loves his kid sister.  This film, based on the book about Josh, written by his father, tells us all about chess, and success, and failure, and acceptance.  It's about winning and losing and the space in between.  The chess playing is well filmed.  Lawrence Fishbourne and Ben Kingsley play the two chess teachers in this boy's life.  Max Pomeranc plays Josh.  I love Max.  I love this film.  You will too.
B00005OM4N|5.0|I want to say thank you to Briteny for putting out awsome ablum. Almost every song is fill with rock,r&amp;b,pop,and little bit of sexy in each one. This ablum also shows that she can write her own music now. I know it was not a easy for her at first write some her songs but she did outstanding job with the five songs she wrote. I bet all the members of nsync and backstreet boys have this ablum and would say to Briteny, you rock girl and music style has improve alot. I think Briteny not only made this ablum about herself but bet she through about what some us women in this world today are going through. I feel just like Briteny sometimes when I want somethings on my own way and be my own boss somethings. You'll know take charge of your life and that the way I feel somethings and probady everyone woman feels. I think Britney took what Density Child words about women in powerment, sexy, taking charge and her own personl stuff she was feel and put all in one hot ablum. I like to say thank the fans for buy this ablum and putting her at 1# on the billboard charts. One more thing, if Briteny is reading this review I hope you get spread more time with your boyfriend and that media and everyeles stay out you and justin personal business. Fans and especialy the media real don't need to kow what going in your lifes.

B00005QXXO|4.0|It's true what you've heard, that these songs are more urgent and visceral sounding than the record versions.  With that in mind I wish they'd included the more rocking guitar version of Packt Like Sardines.  That song (the live version) is stuck in my head all the time.  If you're a big RH fan you may have already downloaded some of these very performances months ago, but the overall package is definitly a good deal that, due to its brevity, leaves you wanting more.  <br />PS: True Love Waits is an incredible song.  There are better renditions of it our there though; it seems like they almost picked a random one.
6301955595|5.0|First, this is not the American actor Guy Stockwell (The War Lord) in this film even though it is listed with his movies. So if you are wanting to see his work, save your money.  But it is a disturbing and at times, horrifying look into the sureal world of Alejandro Jodorowsky. There is plenty of symbolism but I'm not sure if it applies in the usual way (example: fire representing purification). This will leave you plenty of ground to create your own symbolic versions of what things represent.  This is a horror film but at the same time it is art taken to an extreme. If you want to find out the plot read all the other reviews.  But if you would rather enter into this open-minded and unknowing (as I did) you will find your mind stretched to thought-provoking capacity. The film is a winner of the special selection division of the Cannes Film Festival.
0385505833|5.0|I highly recommend this book. I enjoyed it so much that my 2 girls are fighting over who will be the next to read it. It had me laughing out loud. Will definitely put you in the Christmas Spirit!!
0553565915|5.0|I found many good points in this book. p.63 says that But when we make the effort to move ourselves away from self and begin to concentrate on the needs of others and how to serve them, we begin to heal. (This is so true.)<br /> I also found Write from the Heart, A Healing Grief Journal and After the Tears, A Gentle Guide to Help Children Understand Death to be helpful grief resources.
B000003TAW|5.0|The BLUE Album is amazing, every single track I listen to, they are all excelent. Its amazing how good this is. If you enjoy music at all, this is it!!!
B000003CUJ|5.0|The Ring Without Words is my VERY favorite CD.  People who enjoy Wagner's music will defintly love this CD.  I only have one SMALL complaint.  It's not the complete Ride of The Valkeries, but I didn't mind.  This CD totaly changeded the way I think of Richard Wilhem Wagner!  Very great busy masterpieces.  Who gets this will be very pleaed and happy.  <BR>Chance Kafka
0743420373|5.0|This book contains very valuable information because it is based on facts, not on boasting or hypothesis. Tons of statistics was conducted and the resulted analysis is very convincing. <br />I guess the most important message this book has for me (and for millions of ordinary employed people) is that becoming financial independent (fancy phrase for wealthy) or a millionaire isn't a dream out of reach. You don't have to give up your job and become self-employed or an entrepreneur overnight. All you need is to take your financial life seriously and setup a goal and start planning for your future. I know it is not easy and sometimes even painful but I believe that is probably the only road that many many ordinary people have to take to fulfill their dream.<br />The reason I really like this book is that it doesn't point you to a short road to rich (which I don't believe in statistically). In fact, the book makes it very clear that accumulating wealth is a long, painful, and sometimes sacrificial process. But the end result is worthwhile. Not only wealth, but also great qualities such as discipline, patience, courage and many others will come as a result of the process. Those are probably the greatest wealth the life has to offer!<br />Great book. Worth reading again and again. It is best if you can put what you learn from it into practice. And that's what I am going to try.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|I first reviewed this CD in November 1999 having no idea that this CD almost didn't see the light of day - which would have been a terrible shame for all of us.<BR>So many things have happened since then - the most significant being the sad news of the breakup of Savage Garden at the end of the Affirmation tour. <BR>The world will continue turning but there is no denying that popular music has lost one of the best acts in music.<BR>Darren Hayes and Daniel Jones have each gone their separate ways but Darren will be back in March with his solo album SPIN....look out for that one.<br />I'm grateful to Darren and Daniel for the musical legacy they have left us. Songs like Truly Madly Deeply and I Knew I Loved You have already become classics - &quot;Truly Madly Deeply&quot; setting a Billboard record as the longest-running single in the A/C charts EVER...and &quot;I Knew I Loved You&quot; in second place.<br />Savage Garden have left us a wealth of well-crafted, well-produced emotional songs on two fantastic albums.<br />I highly recommend Affirmation and the debut CD.<br />Savage Garden will be soley missed as a duo but we haven't seen the LAST of Darren Hayes and Daniel Jones...<br />Good luck to them.
B000002I2I|4.0|This is the only Doors album that I really like -- all the others sound forced and pretentious. But there's a real sense of authenticity here that puts all their other releases to shame. The Doors were, hands down, the most overrated band in the history of rock -- but you'd have a hard time believing that after listening to the sublime &quot;Morrison Hotel&quot;. Recommended.
B00003CXSP|1.0|Oh Boy was I disappointed with this pile of crud. Ridley Scott has never made a 1.85:1 movie in his life but, for some reason, he made this his first. I thought that Manhunter had very cool widescreen photography and Jonathan Demme really should have followed in its footsteps. I thought I could depend on Scott to give us photography as good as he given us before (Legend, Thelma and Louise). But NO! I have to get that MAJOR gripe out of the way first. But I have some other gripes. Mainly that the film is incredibly boring and has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Hopkins was cool and creepy in SOTL but here he is just campy and hammy. Did he deliberately try to turn Hannibal Lector into a gay icon?<br /><br />SOTL received 4 Academy Awards but Hannibal deserves a truckload of Razzies. There are countless, scenes after scenes, of Clarice watching tapes of surveillance cameras and some Italian cop pacing about a rainy and miserable Florence. Ray Liotta pops up occasionally playing a role that was played by someone else in SOTL. He doesn't do much and contributes ZERO to the story. It seems that the only reason his character was in the movie was for the GROSS, GROSS, INCREDIBLY, GROSS ending. The ending is worth the price of admission but it is not worth sitting thru 2 hours of trash to see.<br /><br />It's a real shame that Manhunter and Silence of the Lambs were concluded with this total pile of garbage. Don't see it, don't rent it, don't buy the DVD and do not watch it on the TV.
B000002UR7|2.0|I bought this CD in the mid/early ninties when I was taken with the dominant progressive rock movement. Yes, I heard the anthem 'creep' and bought the album based on that song, which is a decent song, but not revolutionary by any means. I was dissapointed by the rest of the album. I just couldn't make it through without getting bored. I was really taken with the pavement album 'wowee zowee' during this period (a classic prog rock album that I still love). Eventually I lost interest in alt rock altogether and wrote radiohead off as a boring band. but just two weeks ago I purchased OK Computer and realized that it really does live up to most of the hype. the improvement from 'pablo honey' to 'OK Computer' is staggering! <br />Sometimes when you buy an album that you like, you want to go back and explore the artist's previous. Don't do that with radiohead. I can say that 'Pablo Honey' is not worth the money.
B000056N8X|1.0|A very poor film that is easily the worst Highlander sequel. Even worse than Highlander 2 (I'm talking about the Renegade version). This totally contradicts the events that took place in the 3 previous films and the plot is totally senseless in every department.<br />Lambert delivers a terrible performance that doesn't even seem like the Connor McLeod we've seen 3 previous times. The story is all over the place and never comes close to remotely coming together. After all the disgrace the Highlander movies have gone thru and the roasting they've gotten from the critics you'd think that the writers would try extra hard with this one but it's seriously terrible.<br />A second disc in the set has a B-cut of the film that improves upon it none. Total trash.<br />The extras are okay and make for a decent purchase but if your not fan of the Highlander series (like I WAS) then stay well away. You seriously have been warned.<br />The DVD is in Dolby 5.1. and is in 2.35:1 anamorpic (not the 1.85:1 as stated by the jacket).
B00005214X|5.0|George Harrison was tremendously underrated. When you have to compete with the likes of Lennon/Mccartney I guess that goes with the territory. It's no suprise that George, the Quiet Beatle, was the first to release a solo album (69's Wonderwall Music). This album however is much more than just a Beatle solo record, it's a record of a great singer/songwriter. It's evident on the triple album that George wasn't one for extravigant pretense. All the arrangements presented here a stripped down, emotional. George really knows how to play for the song and not his own self indulgance. George is also a heavily underrated guitarist. He may not play the fastest or the loudest, but his tone and phrasing and intuitive sense of melody are sublime. THe themes of the record ( religion/spirituality,love,and getting on with ones life) are timeless. no wonder this album sounds as fresh today as it did back then and no wonder modern bands such as Live and Creed are continuing to explore these themes. This is a record that any true music enthusiast must have in their collection.
B00005Q66T|4.0|There isn't a music collection in the world that isn't without a Madonna CD. Why? She's quintessential pop and, as so often stated before, is able to recreate her image and her music, thus always sounding fresh, exciting and up-to-date.<br />So here's &quot;Greatest Hits, Volume 2,&quot; and it's about time! But judging from the track selection, we could've waited a bit longer.<br />1990's &quot;The Immaculate Collection&quot; is by far one of the premiere greatest hits albums of all time. And &quot;GHV2&quot; won't displease die-hard Madonna fans. However, on &quot;Immaculate,&quot; there was something for everybody. The early pop efforts like &quot;Borderline&quot; and &quot;Like A Virgin&quot; were rounded off nicely by mature works like &quot;Justify My Love&quot; and &quot;Rescue Me.&quot; <br />The latter two songs were newly recorded for the compilation, but don't look for any new songs on &quot;GHV2.&quot; Perhaps a new song, or even a live track from the Queen of Pop's recent &quot;Drowned World Tour&quot; would have spiced up an otherwise dull collection.<br />&quot;The Immaculate Collection&quot; featured 15 back-to-back hits, with no fillers, and the two new songs went on to become big as well. On &quot;GHV2,&quot; you get the hits all right. Essential works like &quot;Deeper and Deeper,&quot; &quot;Erotica,&quot; &quot;Frozen,&quot; and &quot;Music&quot; are included. <br />But really, &quot;Bedtime Story&quot;? &quot;Drowned World/Substitute for Love&quot;? Don't get me wrong. They're terrific songs. But this is supposed to be a hits collection. What happened to &quot;This Used To Be My Playground&quot; or &quot;You'll See&quot;? They were both bigger hits than &quot;Bedtime Story&quot; and &quot;Drowned World.&quot; <br />Granted, you can't fit all of Madonna's hits on one CD, (let alone five) and she did leave some hits off of &quot;The Immaculate Collection.&quot; But this collection, which isn't chronological, seems padded by non-essential works that could have been replaced with far superior choices.
B000002BSG|4.0|Generally this is an excellent album I would agree with a previous review on that some of the slower ballads dont quite fit the musically style (That from a personal view however). But on up-tempo songs such as Virtual Insanity and Cosmic Girl the rhythms and grooves are overwhelmingly infectious. The diverse use of sounds and instruments keeps you interested and some of the Bass lines are excellent. Some might say that the style is not earth-shatteringly original, which may be true, but the feel of the music is amazingly soulful and so I dont really give a F**k if its original or not.
0449227421|5.0|this was the first follett book i ever read, and i had never even heard of the guy until i saw a commercial for the genetic-suspense-thriller movie &quot;the third twin&quot; a few years ago.  i happened to have missed the movie (and i never heard about it again), but i went out and got the book right away. after reading  it, i was hopelessly hooked on follett.<br />i know others reviewers here have said that follett's other books are better, but if you are into science and genetic research, then this book is for you!  i personally have not read nor have an interest in reading the follett novels that are set during WWII or some other war.  i HATE war stories (and war movies too).  i find it the most boring topic on earth.  other than a mild  interest in the civil war and revolutionary war, i couldnt care less.  WWII...ho hum.  <BR>follett books NOT about war that I have read and thoroughly enjoyed:<BR>1. a dangerous fortune<BR>2. the third twin<BR>3. paper money<BR>4.  the modigliani scandal (ok, i just bought it today)<br />The Third Twin is a must-read!!  Who knows, now that they have already begun cloning, ya never know...
6302034981|1.0|I am old enough to remember when this was playing at the drive-in theatre.  Someone has edited this (once cult classic) to the extent it is just a &quot;STUPID&quot; old movie!  It is for certain a &quot;SICK&quot; movie, it was supposed to be.  Now however the PG13 version is just &quot;STUPID&quot; and a waste of time.  I was forced to give 1 star but not by choice...I give this version a big zero!
B00005JKOJ|5.0|I just bought the DVD last month and I am very impressed.  I've had both VHS and laserdisc versions of this film for some time, but the vibrance of the color and the quality of the sound has never been better.  Definitely one of the better DVD transfers out there.  Well worth the money! Go Babs!
B00005QDW5|5.0|This is a tremendous compilation cd.  It covers all phases (and faces) of Pink Floyd.  The song selection is outstanding and the digital magic work on the songs is amazing.  The songs are NOT in chronological order.  Instead they are grouped in a sonic undulation of fast/slow, up/down, oldest/most recent.<br />  This method gives the cd balance and since a lot of the hard core probably do not like the songs since Roger Waters left, I find that this sustains interest in all the material.  Some of Pink Floyd's efforts sank into the depths of Water's depression and thankfully those songs are avoided-(sorry Roger).  Syd Barrett is showcased a lot also.  Whether neophyte or old guard this album is for you.  And at about 6 cents a minute, it is truly a musical bargain.
B00005R2M3|4.0|Shakira's &quot;Donde&quot; album is possibly my favorite CD ever, so I knew it would be hard for me to like &quot;Laundry Service&quot; as much.  Unfortunately, even without my high expectations this album is somewhat disappointing.  Shakira's english lyrics are just not as good as her Spanish ones--too formal and too structured--not that this is surprising for someone song-writing in her third or fourth language, but still sad because it robs English language listeners of the wit and poetry of her Spanish language lyrics.  Also, her voice lacks the punching beat, conviction, adeptness, and emotion that have made her music so powerful and appealing--and that are still evident in the Spanish songs on this album.  &quot;Suerte&quot; and &quot;Te Aviso&quot; are new Shakira classics-- far superior to their english equivalents &quot;whenever, wherever&quot; and &quot;objection.&quot;<BR>Everyone should go buy this album, despite the lackluster English tracks.  The 4 Spanish tracks make it worth the price, and the English tracks are fine if you listen to the music and ignore the words. If we are lucky, maybe this album will familiarize enough people with Shakira's amazing talent to allow her to return to singing and writing in Spanish and still chart in the US...<BR>By the way, I think Shakira fans should blame Gloria Estefan for these lousy English songs.  Ms. Estefan not only apparently convinced Shakira to make an English album, but she also has the lyric-writing or co-writing credits on the worst, most mangled tracks... <BR>At any rate, Shakira is still AMAZING, and I can't wait for her next Spanish language album (please!)
B00004SYWZ|5.0|I have been a rock lover for years (I am 51), having listened to rock music since the Beatles and the Stones, to Pink Floyd Genesis and Jethro Tull. Up to this record, I thought that rock was British. This A-ha record has shown that Norwegian musicians have much to say. I listen this CD entirely and not only once, but twice in each session. The CD quality (made in Germany) is 1st class with an incredible recording quality. <br />I rate this record as one of the top in my list, together with Foxtrot (Genesis), The Minstrel in the Gallery (Jethro Tull)  and Abbey Road (The Beatles).
B000002UAU|5.0|Sgt. Pepper, in my opinion, is the personification of what the Beatles are. Sure, Revolver was great, as was The White Album and Abbey Road, but the concept, as well as the music, makes this album the one that stands out to me.<br />     Opening with the title track, a nice introduction, it quickly segues into With a Little Help From my Friends, a great song with Ringo on vocals. Much more bouncy than the Joe Cocker version that I was used to. By the way, note that (I think) this was the first album to have two continous sides of music with no interruptions between the songs. Anyway, Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds comes up next, which is John's psychedelia at its best. Other noticable tracks are Getting Better, Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite, When I'm Sixty-Four, and of course, A Day in the Life, one of the gretaest songs ever recorded by any band.<br />     Of course, every song on this album is good enough to listen to, which is what makes it so good. If you're willing to give up 39 minutes, stop what you're doing and just lay down and listen to Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band play, I think you'll find it very rewarding when the crashing piano chord at the end of A Day in the Life fades away into nothing.
B00005R2M3|5.0|The CD is simply great, just as the previous' ones. You just have to listen to it carefully and you will see how good it is.
0064407667|1.0|I am very disappointed in the rating of this book.  New York Times Bestseller List published it as age 10 and up.  I wasn't going to purchase it for our library and then Booklist reviewed it and also had the age limit as age 10 and up.  I purchased it and got a complaint right off quick.  I read the book and find it to be very dark humor.  In this day of violence and terrorisim, I find this book to be horrendous.  The villain is out to kill three children.  The mention of him marrying a 14 yr. old child to get her fortune is very suggestive and there is no mention of the care of the infant child, only torture.  I had purchased three books before I realized the content.  Needless to say they have been moved to our young adult section which is for ages 13 and up.  I just feel it is not appropriate for the age level it is being suggested for.  I hate to think I have to read every book before I put it on the shelf.  That is what I am relying on my reviewers for.
B00000K19E|5.0|From the heart-pounding beginning to the suspense-filled end The Matrix captures your attention and never lets go.  The Matrix is a mixture of Sci-Fi, action, and martial arts; all the elements of an awesome movie.  With a plot that stretches your imagination.  <BR> The main character Neo(Keanu Reeves) becomes a target of the Agents.  He is rescued by Morpheous(Laurence Fishbourn) and his team who are fighting the artificial intelligence machines that have taken over the Earth.  Morpheous tell Neo of \\"The world that is pulled over our eyes to shield us from the truth.\\"  Morpheous believes Neo is \\"the one\\" who will deliver them to freedom.  Neo has to learn to manipulate The Matrix to conquer his enemies.  This is where the action comes in.  Does Neo succeed? Is he the one? You'll have to see for yourself.<BR> I can tell you that the special effects are phenomenal and the action will leave you saying \\"Wow\\".  Every time I see The Matrix I'm always as impressed as the first time I saw it.  I can't wait for the sequels.  Could they possibly be as good as the first?
B000002C1W|5.0|I really like this disc.  It opens in spectacular fashion with &quot;Signs Of Life&quot;, and continues on with &quot;Learning To Fly&quot;, and &quot;The Dogs Of War&quot;.  &quot;Learning To Fly&quot; and &quot;Sorrow&quot; are great songs, with &quot;Sorrow' 8 and a half minutes long.  The disc is very atmospheric and the only nod to the 80's is the electronic drum; and I don't know if that's such a bad thing.  I listen to the music anyway; that is what I am intersted in, I don't really care about the lyrics.  Therefore I can't comment on them.  It has that floating, spacey feeling with those long drawn out bass lines.  There is really good guitar work, as David Gilmour, who wrote all the songs, is right out in front.  There are 19 musicians and singers on this disc, and it has that felling of alot of sounds participating.  The disc is made in 1987 and is totally relevant today.  The sound of it holds up perfectly.  I like it and I play it.  It's what you would expect from Pink Floyd, and it's updated to the period.  I think the guitar work is the only surprise and it's a good, raw contrast to the pomposity, and orchestral feel of the music.
B0000024SD|5.0|This was Dylan's first masterpiece from the 60s; and it showed past, present, and future all at the same time. Half acoustic, half electric, &quot;Bringing it All Back Home&quot; upped the ante for what so called folk-rock could do.<br />There are some great moments here: 'It's All Over Now Baby Blue' and 'It's Allright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding' are among the zenith of Dylan's 60s songwriting. There aren't any shortage of hits here either between 'Mr. Tambourine Man' and 'Subterranean Homesick Blues.'<br />What this album effectively did was alienate some of the folkies from Dylan's corner, but it was the beginning of him reaching a whole new scope in his audience. As it all culminated in &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot; and the 65-66 World Tour, Dylan helped revolutionize music. This was where it started though. Inasmuch as it is often overshadowed by &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot; and &quot;Blonde on Blonde,&quot; this album is a masterpiece in its' own right.
B000003N7G|5.0|I cannot say anything about this that hasn't already been said.  It is a suite in 3 parts.  It is written by John Coltrane.  If you have the desire to know what John Coltrane is about, then listen to this.  It is accessible music.  His playing, which is an aquired taste, is not too far out on here.  It is understanble.  The playing is, of course, top notch by everyone and is a disc a Jazz entusiast has to have.  A reason to get into John Coltrane, is that all the Tenor players today play like him.  I find that appreciating Jazz is understand what is going on and where it came from.  If I am listening to anyone today, I have to master Johbn Coltrane.  Of course, the songs are beautiful, and the playing is world class.  I find nothing but beauty in this.  This is a performance that you definately must own.  It is the classic Coltrane quartet; McCoy Tyner on piano, Jimmy Garrison on bass, and Elvin Jones on Drums.  McCoy Tyner's comping on the first song is extremely boring to me, but what do I know.  This is one of the classic Jazz albums.  One of the top 5 of all time on anyone's list, so everyone has to have this.  The top players today live for this album, so this is something that should be bought.  It's a beautiful experience.
B0000024SI|5.0|These are the sounds of Bob Dylan at his absolute artistic peak (at least during the 60s, that is). &quot;Highway 61 Revisted&quot; is more focused than &quot;Blonde on Blond&quot; and it is more feverish than its' predecessor, &quot;Bringing It All Back Home.&quot; <br />Some of Dylan's best songs are here: 'Ballad of a Thin Man,' 'Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues' and 'Like a Rolling Stone' have become timeless classics. <br />One can really can't go wrong with this period in Dylan's output, but this album is simply the most controlled, ambitious, and perfected album that he ever put together with the possible exception of 1975's &quot;Blood on the Tracks.&quot;<br />If you don't like greatest hits packages this is definitely the album to start off with from his earlier years. Indispensible to any serious rock and roll collection.
0375707972|4.0|I read very few books but I could not unglue myself from Bernard Schlink's The Reader.  This story is about Michael, a young boy...only 15 and with newfound hormones I'm sure...and his older lover Hanna.  I found it to be not only shocking and disturbing at first, but I was close to throwing it across the room at the thought of this &quot;couple&quot; being together.  It was not until I got past the initial shock factor that I saw how beautiful and touching Michael's pure feelings for Hanna were.  To recognize the &quot;love&quot; you must think as a juvenile...innocently and sensitive.  You will find yourself caught up in a time where you believed that your childhood sweetheart was the only one in the world that could fulfill your heart's desires.<br />Later on in the story Michael has grown and at this time Hanna is no longer a part of his life.  It is not until he sees her in a courtroom for her crimes during the Holocaust that he meets up with that area of his life once more.  Does that love still exist in the depths of Michael's heart?  As the reader you find yourself really examining that love and applying it to your own life.  Has Hanna crafted an important part of his life that stays with him today?  You'll also evaluate the things that crafted your life...the things that gave it depth and meaning.  Schlink's adding of a story to the history of the Holocaust made that part of history all the more alive for his readers.  It brings you in...heart and soul.
B00005B36H|5.0|this album is one of tools greatest.i like all of tool's albums.the only B.S. about this is that this album has no EXPLICT LYRICS, its not that i dont like music with no cussing, i dont mind but this pages says it has explict lyrics. so all you kids that your parents dont let you get it becuse what it says. thats a damn lie.tool is the best band cause their music is good.lateralus doesnt even say damn or shut up so there is no explict lyrics.ok.
B00005R2M3|2.0|I bought `Donde Estan Las Ladrones?` on a whim a few months ago and was struck by the power of this Columbian chanteuse's voice. I never took Spanish in high school, but this CD made me want to sign up immediately for classes. I waited anxiously for the release of `Laundry Service`, to hear what her amazing voice would sound like. Unfortunately, Shakira's voice is nowhere to be found on her English language debut. The only times you get a real sense of her gifts as a singer are on the four Spanish language tracks (particularly `Suerte`, the Spanish version of `Whenever, Wherever`). I was especially disappointed with the English `Ojos Asi` - the words did not flow as well into the Arabic stanzas. Overall, the production quality is pretty weak. You can barely hear her voice at times over the percussion and bass beats. A real shame. Let's hope any subsequent English releases are better, because Shakira deserves much better than this effort.
B000002H33|5.0|Am listening to it as I type ... their peak - you can see them improve from the moment Burton joined the band (midway thru Kill 'Em All), they're awesome on Ride The Lightning, and then this ... what can I say ... a masterpiece of musical and lyrical excellence. Sadly, this was Burton's last album ... and after that, Met went steadily downwards with a more mainstream sound. This album's probably the best metal album you'll ever hear. If you've heard Load or Reload or the black album and thought that was good, wait till you hear this ...
6303965415|4.0|The first time I watched this film, I had trouble following the story and catching the words that were so often mumbled.  However, when I reached the end, I immediately rewound the tape and watched the first half a second time in order to better appreciate the fine production and story that this is. Each time I watch it, it improves.<br /><br />This movie lead me to read the book. I am delighted that the movie contains so many direct quotes, and depicts the book's characters so well.<br /><br />This movie also lead me to become a Jane Austen fan. I have read nearly all of her published writings, read a few of her biographies, and watched all of the films. This one remains one of my favorite Jane Austen movies.

6303471714|5.0|I bought this tape when I was 21 and ten years later I still can't seem to part with it. I just dusted it off recently after four years, two babies and nursing the last one for two years (whew)! So naturally I have a few pounds to lose and some firming up to do. I made it to about the middle of the toning section for the legs and couldn't believe how out of shape I really was. There was a time that I could do both 45 min routines back to back 3 days a week (you definitely need to alternate with a cardio routine on other days-this is strictly a &quot;body shaping&quot; tape)! I love this workout, it does get the job done and Cindy doesn't sugar coat anything about getting there either. I believe that this tape is safe so long as you have a good understanding of making modifications in some of the exercises and doing the abs section in a more controlled manner(which works the abs better anyway). The music and scenery is wonderful, too. I definitely got my money's worth on this video. And I hope to be doing those 45 min routines back to back again!
B00003CXCQ|5.0|Okay, before I begin, I should tell you that this isn't a review of the movie &quot;Snow White &amp; The Seven Dwarfs&quot;. I'm gonna be talking about the bonus stuff included on the DVD!<br />&quot;Snow White &amp; The Seven Dwarfs&quot; is the most advanced DVD I have ever seen. Even though that alone might not say much, (Our family curently owns only 5 DVDs) I can tell it's great judging by what the other people are saying. The movie itself has been fully restored, and it looks better than it ever did before! <br />Disc One of the DVD contains the film, as well as audio commentary by Walt Disney himself (I know he would be proud of just how great this DVD is). The forty minute &quot;Making Of Snow White&quot; is also great. And the new version of &quot;Some Day My Prince Will Come&quot; is so good, it might put Snow White herself to shame. <br />My favorite part of the DVD just might be the great trivia game, &quot;Dopey's Wild Mine Ride&quot;. Players have to help Dopey gather the other dwarfs from the mine to help him save Snow White. It's a thriling experience!<br />Disc Two of the DVD is also great. The deleted scenes just might be the best part, and there are surprisingly alot of them. Some are fully animated! Another treat is the &quot;Disney Through The Decades&quot; film: It not only let's us see what's been hapenning with Disney through the years, but it also let's us see &quot;Snow White's&quot; original trailers. The first one doesn't even show any actual scenes from the film.<br />There's much, much more on this DVD, but I don't want to spoil it all for you. But I will tell you that after watching some of this DVD, I have a new respect for &quot;Snow White&quot; that I never thought I'd have!
B000002H2H|5.0|I just don't think it gets much better than this. Though I am a huge fan of all of Metallica's work, mostly the pre-black album stuff, this is my favorite album.  Very few bands are able to show such a wide range of talents on a particular album, but you can see the band going through phases seeminly right before your eyes.  The brutal Fight Fire With Fire opens with the comically soft intro, while Ride The Lightning tackles tough emotion with a beautifully crafted epic piece.  Fade To Black...I think nearly everyone had heard it and knows of its greatness.  A lot of people agree with me when they say that Escape is one of Metallica's most underrated songs, along with Trapped Under Ice.  Perhaps they are a victim of being stashed on a CD with other classics like Fade and For Whom The Bell Tolls - but you will love these songs just as much - if not more.  And Call of Ktulu is simply amazing, perhaps the best piece of work in Metallica's entire catalog, if you're into instrumentals of course.  This album is recommended to anyone who enjoys classic thrash metal with thoughtful lyrics and impressive song structures.
B00005AQEA|5.0|The first rap/hiphop double cd ever. 2pac will remain the greatest rapper of all time. All Eyez on Me went 6X Platinum. If you don't have this cd go out and but it. This CD is a peice of Rap History. Every Track on this cd is perfect for people that like listening to music all day. For an example You might listen to Cali Love , when your at a party. Then you might listen to \\"I aint mad at cha\\" when your going to bed. Then \\"How do u want it\\" when your sexin. If you've heard Pac b4 u know wat his style is and he can change up is flow on nearly every song. This CD is tight coming from an awesome Producer DRE. 2pac Lives On
B000002N2Z|3.0|i like the deftones, not intensely but they're on my good list.  the thing about this album i like is that it's very raw-which also is its undoing, as i think it gets repetitive but it does have its moments.  bottom line, listen to it if you're angry or just want to mosh.  i'm interested in their white pony album cause i've heard its much more creative and expanding their focus, plus the dj is on it.  best tracks here: bored, minus blindfold, nosebleed, engine #9
B00005R2M3|4.0|In her young carreer, Shakira has made a name for herself in the latin market. Now this extraordinary Colombian beauty mines her talent as an &quot;English&quot; Language artist, and the result is wonderful. If there's such a thing as Columbian Soul, this girl's got it. Expressive, adventerous, and laden with hooks, &quot;Laundry Service&quot; is the perfect introduction for those not yet inducted into the distinctive sound that IS Shakira's music.<br />I first heard Shakira in Spanish...folks, you DON'T have to understand the words to enjoy her work...needless to say, I prefer the original &quot;Ojos Asi&quot; , perhaps because I feel it is more suited to translation via the most romantic language in the world ...Spanish!<br />If you're looking for an entertaining diversion, taking a long car trip, or having a bad day at the office, spin this C.D.its a great escape...Shakira can look forward to years of popularity, great album sales, and standing ovations...But please Shakira, ditch the bleached hair...you're beautiful a la natural!!!
B00005QXXO|5.0|I had tickets to see Radiohead last August at one of the Bull Run shows outside Washington, D.C.  When both shows were cancelled due to weather, I was crushed because I had heard so much about the quality of Radiohead's live performances... not to mention the fact that I was missing my absolute favorite band.  <br />&quot;I Might Be Wrong&quot;, in a way, almost makes up for missing them live.  I can't stand live albums, but this album is truly amazing.  Like Spinning Plates is the flat-out highlight of the album... it is by far one of Radiohead's most beautiful and powerful moments ever recorded, and it alone justifies this purchase.  The versions of Idioteque and Morning Bell are also top notch though.<br />If you like Radiohead immensely, or even if you don't, check this out.  Radiohead has never really put out a bad album, and this is just as great as everything else they've done.  And if you've never seen them live, this in some ways will suffice.
B00005Q66T|2.0|I have been the biggest of Madonna fans for over seven years now and I was disappointed to say the least, to find out that all of the tracks are EDITED!!! Come on people!!! Has Madonna ever let herself been edited? I think not!! Let me know when the old Madonna comes back.
B00003CXZ1|5.0|This movie was really better than I had expected. In past experiences, other movies I saw that were based on video games turned out to be terrible, however this one was different from all the others. I believe this film very well could have turned out to be like the others of its kind, but Angelina Jolie was the perfect action heroine. It was nice to see a girl action hero for once. I probably would not have even watched it if she wasn't in it.   I also liked the fact that her dad in the movie was her real life dad. You could sense a father-daughter chemistry in their &quot;flashback&quot; scenes together.    There was also a strange chenistry between her and the bad guy in this movie. Sometimes you couldn't tell if he was really &quot;bad.&quot; A review in Rolling Stone said that the bad guy looked like he was &quot;liposuctioned from Pierce Brosnan's a**&quot;, which is true, but not necessarily a bad thing. He definitely played a good villian.    The acting is excellent, the script is good, and there are some killer action sequences. This film is perfect for any fan of action movies, Angelina Jolie, or the video game, and great for anyone else who likes a good movie.
B00002E224|5.0|A romance set in Europe (and Vienna at that!).   Beautiful.
B00005QHPQ|5.0|A great album, from top to bottom, you can get lost in ballads such as &quot;Hero&quot; but you should not define the whole album by that song. Personal favorites are: Don't Turn Off the Lights, Love To See You Cry,  Maybe, and One Night Stand. This album includes something for all music lovers from latin beats (It does include 3 Spanish songs), r&amp;b, rock, and of course pop. This album is for certain to be a delight for quite some time.
B00003CX5P|2.0|Lucas certainly developed and used a whole horde of new CGI and other special effects technologies in the making of this; it's too bad that the story has so many holes in it.<br />The clear purpose of it is to introduce us to &quot;He Who Shall Become Darth Vader.&quot;  <br />Unfortunately, rather than creating a cast of characters appropriate to him, it ties huge amounts of the story to the &quot;future&quot; characters.  R2D2 and C3PO apparently knew &quot;Darth,&quot; as a boy, and he spent some &quot;quality&quot; time on Tatooine.  This makes the story of &quot;A New Hope&quot; make a whopping lot _less_ sense.  Darth Vader _knows_ the robots; he _knows_ Tatooine; he should even have some bittersweet memories of he and his mother living there.  Instead, in IV, he chooses to just _ignore_ all this stuff...<br />Another thing that _really_ irritates me is the whole &quot;Anakin's Mom&quot; part of the story.  After Anakin does so much to help out a Princess who RULES A PLANET, they can't imagine the notion of sending back a &quot;Galactic Express&quot; funds transfer to buy his mother out of slavery?<br />The waffling over whether Anakin should get trained seems pretty nonsensical, too; if the Jedi Council is so worried about him getting training, it would make sense for them to actually Do Something.  Maybe put him to death due to the danger.  (Pretty amoral, but we know, what with Parts IV-VI that he's going to kill a whopping lot of people, and help throw the empire into deadly chaos.  Nipping him &quot;in the bud&quot; would be pretty logical.)  Or even to just say &quot;We'll keep him around, at the Jedi Academy; he'll get a Special Training Course.&quot;  (That would _actually_ amount to keeping him under guard...)<br />But instead they propose just tossing him away, right when it's clear that there are Dark Jedi Forces that would doubtless be _fabulously_ interested in such a potentially-powerful apprentice.<br />And the only way Jar Jar is at _all_ forgiveable is if he proves to be some sort of unconscious &quot;Drunken Jedi Master&quot; that hasn't realized who he actually is...
B000002NHN|5.0|the music takes you on a journey from Ireland to Siberia and it is readily appearant in the music itself.  The trip flows naturally and smoothly.  I love the tranquility of the sounds in the house.
B00004XONN|5.0|Although I prefer the Radiohead of old, containing interesting guitar licks and traditional band styling, this album was a refreshing musical interlude. It is a great album to listen to from beginning to end, making it a &quot;keeper&quot; in the cd player.
B00003CXXI|4.0|I loved the film and it's great for all ages, but I have to pick a bone with the mixed message.  The message is that looks don't count, and then poor Lord Farquaad is barraged with crude, old, and non funny &quot;short&quot; jokes.  SPOILER ALERT AHEAD:  Ok, then the Princess Fiona/Shrek love story moral is that looks don't count.  Well, when she is supposed to be &quot;beautiful&quot; she has a body that doesn't happen to mortals without extensive plastic surgery (typical tiny waist massive breasts).  Then when she turns &quot;ugly&quot; she gets a nice, ripe and ATTRACTIVE figure that mirrors most of America and the donkey cruelly shrieks, &quot;YOU ATE PRINCESS FIONA&quot;.  So the message is that fat people are ugly, but it doesn't matter because they have inner beauty?  And just who is going to be the doll?  Why, of course, it's the &quot;beautiful&quot; Fiona.
B00000331V|5.0|The title says it all.  I bought this album when it was released in '76 and it rocked then and it still rocks today.  Definite party music - guaranteed to get the house rockin'.
B00005OM4N|4.0|I thought the cd was great. she expressed how she felt about growing up like i'm overprotected.
B00004WKII|5.0|THE JIMI HENDRIX EXPERIENCE is a great 4 cd box set of alternate studio recordings and live recordings. All of the songs are , somewhat , in chronological order. The live recordings are in chronological order spanning from 1967 to 1970. All together , there are 56 tracks and 44 of the tracks are previously unreleased recordings. One track ; &quot;(Have You Ever Been To)Electric Ladyland&quot; , is a version that hadn't been released in the U.S. until this 4 cd set. The cd's come in a cool purple suede box and the box comes with a 79 page booklet that gives the story behind each song in the box set. <br />Jimi Hendrix is considered by many(including myself) to be the greatest rock and roll guitarist ever so when something like this 4 cd box set is presented to the public then you take notice. There are great alternate versions of some classic Hendrix tunes and this 4 cd set just further confirms this man's greatness. <br />My personal favorites are SGT. PEPPER(CD2) , LITTLE WING(cd 2&amp;3) , BOLD AS LOVE(cd2) , SPANISH CASTLE MAGIC(cd3) , HEY BABY/IN FROM THE STORM(cd4) recorded live in Hawaii is a powerful hybrid tune , EARTH BLUES(cd4) is a very positive and spirited song that I find myself playing alot , the Isle of Wight recording of IN FROM THE STORM(cd4) , and SLOW BLUES(cd4) is the final song of the box set and was secretly recorded as Hendrix , Mitchell , and Cox did a jam session of this laid-back blues tune. We get about one minute and 45 seconds of this song before it suddenly cuts off. It is said to be his final multi-track studio recording. Its a very pretty tune that seems symbolic of his career ; something great cut short.<br />You get unreleased versions of PURPLE HAZE , HEY JOE , STONE FREE , FREEDOM , FOXEY LADY , and on and on and on. The majority of these recordings you won't find on any other cd. They are like newly discovered priceless treasures. This is a box set that you will cherish like 24 karat gold.
B00005QJDG|5.0|Is this triple CD live album worth five stars and, more importantly, worth buying? Hmmm. Let's see:<br />1. Four of the most talented musicians in the world (plus one singer who tries hard not to be too irritating) at the peak of their craft, playing their butts off in a dizzying display of virtuosity.<br />2. Crystal-clear production by two of the four musicians (Mike Portnoy and John Petrucci). <br />3. A new keyboard player (Jordan Rudess) who's given the band a huge shot in the arm.<br />4. Every note of Scenes From a Memory (their absolutely astounding previous album) played live -- not to mention a smattering of their very best songs.<br />5. An obviously appreciative audience.<br />6. An energy so palpable that you'd swear you were there watching this performed. <br />I dunno. What do you think?<br />The last triple live album I purchased was Emerson Lake &amp; Palmer's &quot;Welcome Back My Friends...&quot; back in the early '70s. Although I enjoyed ELP immensely, even I thought three albums worth of material was a bit of a challenge. (One review at the time described ELP's bombastic performance as &quot;everything but the kitchen sink.&quot;)<br />However, this three CD set from Dream Theater -- which, because of today's recording technology, is easily TWICE as long as ELP's triple live album -- seems to end much too quickly. So captivating is the performance that you just don't want it to end. (&quot;Home,&quot; from Scenes From a Memory, is a monster of a song played live!)<br />DT seems to be upping the ante every time they release a live album. Their first (Live At the Marquee, 1993) was a single. Their second, (Once In a Live Time, 1998) was a double. Now this: Live Scenes From New York, a brazen THREE CDs of material from arguably one of the best bands in the world. At this rate, I can't wait to see their fourth live album!<br />Anyway, the entire Scenes From a Memory album is played flawlessly. And with great energy. The first CD and a half is devoted to this concept album, and it's quite a ride let me tell you.<br />Other standout tracks include, well, just about everything else.<br />If you're a fan of Dream Theater, this is a must-have release. Even though I don't usually recommend live albums to first-time listeners, in this case I'll make an exception. Live Scenes From New York is a superb intro to the heady world of Dream Theater. Enjoy!
B000002UDB|3.0|There is little doubt that the beatles wrote a lot of infectious pop tunes but to deify them as THE BEST band of all time as so many do is laughable.The Beatles came along at the right time and place and struck a chord with a mass audience.That does not make them great,however.Their music is thoroughly lightweight-musical popcorn,if you please.Led Zeppelin had soul and emotion and great musicianship.The Stones had it all for the first ten or twelve years.Blach Sabbath had a depth and guitar playing second to none.Metallica with Cliff Burton was untouchable.To hear &quot;Call of Ktulu&quot; or &quot;Orion&quot; is to know The Beatles just aren't in the same league with the true greats.A hundred years from now The Beatles will be little more than a footnote in the annals of music.This album is pretty good.If quaint and occasionally charming featherweight tunes are your thing then this album is as good as any.Have a nice day!
B00000JCOV|5.0|When you think of Slipknot, naturally the first thing that comes to mind is the masks and jumpsuits, the anti-image image.  Fortunately, once you get past that there is great music that comes roaring out of this 9 man metal machine.  Let's start with the basics.  The guitar exhibited by the bands two guitarists is admirable in its own right, it ranges from delicately intricate (&quot;Prosthetics&quot;) to all out aural assault (&quot;Liberate&quot;, &quot;Only One&quot;).  This, in combination with AMAZING percussion courtesy of Joey Jordison, serves as the foundation for the entire album.  Just the velocity that Jordison is able to achieve is mind blowing.  I have seen them live and Jordison is just simply an incredible drummer all around, I cannot emphasize this enough!  I like the addition of a sampler just because he adds so many interesting little &quot;bells and whistles&quot; to the music.  Most of these are very subtle, but once you notice them they will always stand out.  The tribal percussion adds a nice touch to the more haunting tracks (&quot;Scissors&quot;).  After Jordison, the major standout is vocalist/lyricist Corey Taylor.  His vocal range, both emotionally and dynamically, is nearly limitless.  He can go from rap (&quot;Spit It Out&quot;) to blood soaked growling (&quot;Surfacing&quot;) to singsong melodic (&quot;Wait and Bleed&quot;) to crystal clear belting (&quot;Me Inside&quot;) to disturbingly haunting (&quot;Prosthetics&quot;).  The lyrics are for the most part intelligent, despite Taylor's penchant for a certain F-word.  At times they are even sardonically witty.  There are several tracks that are standouts:  &quot;Wait and Bleed&quot; for being bold enough to combine melody and thrash, &quot;Spit it Out&quot; (particularly the hyper version off the Digipak) shows Taylor's ability to unleash a string of words at a head spinning velocity, &quot;Me Inside&quot; also showcases Taylors abilities most notably on the &quot;I wasn't promised at thing...&quot; line. and &quot;Scissors&quot; for the sheer creepiness of the song, if you listen to it in a dark room, it will cause your imagination to run wild with thoughts of what may be hiding in the darkness.  By far my favorite track is &quot;Prosthetics.&quot;  It is somewhat of a sadistic love song, that tells a story of someone completely enveloped and obsessed with another person to the point of actually kidnapping them and keeping them all to themselves.  Listen for the line &quot;Better make yourself at home...&quot;  I won't tell you the rest but it truly take the idea of obsession to an entirely new level!  Overall this is an awesome album, except for the exclusion of &quot;Purity&quot; which is truly an amazing song.  I never used to listen to any metal at all but after listening to this just once, I was addicted and to this day Slipknot is my favorite band, so  just remember to look past the masks and appreciate the creativity and uniqueness of the album.
B00005QDW5|5.0|This collection showcases three decades of a band whose work puts most other groups and individuals to shame.Few rock bands have ever been as good at crafting a piece of music as Pink Floyd.Most so-called artists today could not write one song as good as &quot;wish you were here&quot;or &quot;time&quot;.Their music has incredible textures and evocative moods.&quot;Shine on you crazy diamond&quot;is one of the true (and few)masterpieces to emerge from the legacy of rock and roll.There is so little talent,ambition or record label support today for Floyd type projects to emerge.Worst of all, groups today consist mainly of people who have had no musical training or understanding of music theory ,so what you have are a bunch of two chord playing garage bands who scream and pound away endlessly and offer nothing that bears repeated hearing.Music must have subtlety,cohesion and real craftsmanship if it is to last and give delight even with numerous listenings.Pink Floyd has all this in spades.Occasionally they veer off into all too typical rock and roll pomposity,but the overall quality of their catalog is as good as anyone's.Highly recommended album as are &quot;Dark side&quot;,&quot;The Wall&quot;,and &quot;Wish you were here&quot;.
B000006TRV|4.0|There are a few grippes with this &quot;Deluxe Packaging Digitally Remastered&quot; The Wall.  First of all, my lyric booklet is missing some songs and has duplicate pages of others. And the final track on disc 2- ends so abrubtly.  I don't remember that being the case when I owned it on Lp, then cassette, then cd(pre-deluxe edition.)  I guess I have become a better musician over the past twenty years, because it just seems a little more simple than it once did.  I'll just bury my comments with the over 400-some others.  Is it just me or do other people have these problems?

B00005R2M3|4.0|So far so good for Shakira in her first English album. She didn't forget the her pre-Laundry Service fans with four of the 13 songs in Spanish. Most people that try to make a fusion of sounds from different backgrounds end up making a big mess but she is an exception. It starts off with a catchy first track which the Spanish version is the last song. It has sounds from different places; the snare drum rythyms sound like a zydeco song you would hear in a Cajun restaurant, weird. Tere is no better song to first pitch out in public than &quot;Whenever, Wherever-Suerte&quot;. The music video is really great, sexy without being raunchy. The other songs are not as strong as the ones in her Spanish albums but are way stronger than that pop stuff. This album has taken sooo long because Shakira doesn't wasnt to make an English album straight outta ESOL class; but she still needs some improvement. In one song it sounds like she is singing &quot;I'm farting&quot; I forgot which song but it is towards the middle of the disk (Track One). I don't think Shakira will lean towards blubble gum pop material, she won't sell out into that but I think that she had to go down a level market herself to debut into the Top 40 market, be able to have TV spots at TRL and the Talk Show circuit. That part she didn't pull the strings on. What other young women are sucessfully going towards the top, write and compose their own material: TWO: Alicia Keys and Gwen Stefani from No Doubt. Obviously Shakira is heading closer to that direction (Real Musical Independence)than Britney, Mandy, and even Mariah's direction of &quot;Infantile Pop&quot;. Shakira's album is a new beginning for greater things to come.
0446677450|4.0|Rich Dad Poor Dad is filled with interesting ideas on how to become rich.  From reading this book, Kiyosaki pounded the idea into my head that school will not make you rich and you must be financially literate to successfully have &quot;money work for you instead of working for money&quot;.  Believe me, the explanation of this is not brief in any possible way.  His repetitive statements at first were bothersome, but it really helped my understanding of the points he was trying to get across to me, the reader.  I learned some valuable things from this book that hopefully will strengthen my skills when I eneter the working world.  The biggest problem with this book was that after reading it, I realized that Kiyosaki's approach to wealth was now the same approach as everyone else who had read the book.  It is disheartening to know that the secret to success is not quite a secret anymore.
B00005QK3W|5.0|This is one of Paul's most solid albums. From &quot;Lonely Road&quot; right through to &quot;Freedom&quot; ,&quot;DRIVING RAIN&quot; has absolutely no filler! Each track is unique(unlike most albums out there nowadays). Paul still has that uncanny ability to deliver original melodies time and time again. Some of the tracks like &quot;About You&quot; and &quot;Rinse the Raindrops&quot; are as hard driving as ANYTHING Paul has ever released. The ballad &quot;From A Lover To A Friend&quot; is as chilling as his love song for Heather &quot;Your Loving Flame&quot; is warm. The title track Driving Rain is the perfect pop song with Paul's pulsating bass line beating throughout. There are also songs like &quot;Spinning On An Axis&quot; and &quot;Riding To Jaipur&quot; that prove yet again that Paul is at ease composing any style of music. All in all Driving Rain is a wonderful album that is an example of what a genius like Sir Paul McCartney can create when he has the inspiration to do so. Do yourself a favor: BUY IT!
B00005QK3W|5.0|THIS ALBUM IS UNREAL. I really can't express how hot this album is. trust me I have had a copy of it two months before it came out and have spent so much time with it, I havn't been able to take it out of the Cd player, I mean the whole thing, 15 tracks and they're all hot(the official release has a 16th track &quot;freedom&quot; which is an awesome song) the only songs that aren't that good are from a lover to a friend and the title track driving rain, but the rest of the album is some of the best music ever.  I'll have to start with she's givin up talkin--man this song breaks the ground it's so deep and the bass is especially, then just flip to track 5 -I DO - it's sooooooooo good this song is a masterpiece, and then the whole rest of the album from there sounds unbelievable. there are some beatlesque songs but this album is pure macca and he does a great job. this album after listening to it a while is starting to be one of the best albums ever, it's at least a step back to the 70's when macca ruled the world, this is no doubt an awesome album like how you would feel about red rose speedway or RAM at that matter, which are two of my most favorite albums , along with the rest of the macca colection. well this one tops all the new releases that have come out for anyone, MACCA is the only one that can keep doin it and keep getting better. Don't base your opinion on this album till you listened carefully cause the melodies along with the lyrics are quite strong. I don't know what Heather has done to Macca, BUT she sure must be doin him right cause he so came through AGAIN. well I'll let the album speak for itself, oh and macca has James on a couple songs and they're both real nice, especially spinnin on an axis, this song is another world or put's you there. LASTLY I must mention Macca's voice, wow He still sounds like a beatle in his 20's, his voice is very clear and sound so good, I mean this guy must have found the fountain of youth cause he hasn't changed a bit.still bangin you in the head, constantly.
B00005QHPQ|4.0|I'm really not an Enrique fan. I think that his voice is one of the weakest in the industry. But the songs he chooses to record for his CD's are first rate. <BR>I was in Tower Records and they were blasting the track &quot;One Night Stand&quot; (produced by Metro, it could have been sung by anyone including Cher). And you know what? I felt compelled to purchase the CD. &quot;Escape&quot; is a solid offering. I'm afraid to say it, but it's one of the better things I've purchased in a while, and the songs are quite addictive.  Enrique's vocals are all over the map (this can be good and bad). In the 80's throwback &quot;Don't Turn Off The Lights&quot; he manages to squeeze some frightening Mariah Carey notes in at the end. Where did this idea come from? Who cares....because it manages to effectively spice up the CD. I can't really find a bad song in the bunch. To be honest, I think &quot;Hero&quot; is the least exciting, least interesting song here.  So if you actually like &quot;Hero&quot; then you're sure to love the album, because many of the other tracks are real winners.  I think that the main title track &quot;Escape&quot; is absolutely teriffic. (i like it almost as much as Rhythm Divine, which I thought was beautiful) The lyrics are fun, and Enrique makes the most out of his paper thin voice. (side bar: I'm sure the producers on this CD got paid for overtime working on cleaning up the notes). If you want something light and fun, then pick up &quot;Escape.&quot; Just don't go looking for a voice. May I suggest Cristian Castro. (now that's a voice!)
B00005Q66T|5.0|I wish there were more stars to give away!! Because if any album deserves it, it's GHV2!<BR>The albums tracks, although all previously relesed are arranged here in a way that will make any Madonna fan say \\"You go girl\\"! For example the second track is 1992's Erotica, (I'm sure you all remember the controversy that accompanied it's relese!) followed up by Human Nature!! (...) I could go on, but I'll spare you!<BR>The songs here are Madonna's best from 1992-2001. This album does not disappoint, in any way. I do however have one small problem, I wish she would have added some new jams to the collection, perhaps the funny cowboy song from her HBO special would have been a nice addition...but alas...this album ROCKS and if you are a fan, and you must be because you're reading this review, BUY IT!!! What are you waiting for!!
B00005R2BG|5.0|This is definitely Oscar calibre. I loved Kidman's character, her story's irony and its romantic twist.
B000002U6E|1.0|My review will probably perplex and annoy the diehard Enigma fans, but sorry they are just not for everyone! I do admit that Return To Innocence is a wonderful song that I first heard on my awesome Pure Moods CD so I bought this Enigma CD but the only song I like is Return To Innocence and while I do like some new age the rest of this CD is just too new agey for my personal taste!
B00005R2M3|5.0|When people say Shakira rocks, believe them, because she does. If you have heard her single &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; on the radio or on T.V., you might think she is another Latin pop act a little late in coming. But you are very much mistaken. Shakira's first song on the album &quot;Objection&quot; is mixed with tango and other Latin beats, which is good song to get up and dance to. But sit back down because on the next song Shakira sings a beautiful, soft ballad that excellently uses an electric guitar for its soft moments. &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; is a song unlike any other, with its South American beats, while &quot;Rules&quot; (the next song) shows who's wearing the pants in Shakira's relationship. Then the Led Zeppelin-like &quot;The One&quot; will show you how Shakira can rock and still bring a tear to your eye. &quot;Ready for the Good Times&quot; is an excellent 80's song that everyone will like (because even though we don't admit it, we love it when old 80's songs come on the radio) and &quot;Fool&quot; will give you another reason to call Shakira the Rockera. &quot;Te Dejo Madrid&quot; has one of the best chorus' on the album but when you hear &quot;Poem to a Horse,&quot; you'll be mesmorized by the ability of Shakira to bring a song completely different and compliment it with poetic verses, this is definately one of the best songs on the album. &quot;Que Me Quedas Tu&quot; shows Shakira still remains strong in her native Spanish with it's powerful, soothing lyrics. &quot;Eyes Like Yours&quot; is the English version of &quot;Ojos Asi&quot; which was on her last two albums, but if you never heard &quot;Ojos Asi,&quot; then you never heard anything like the Middle Eastern influenced &quot;Eyes Like Yours.&quot; &quot;Suerte&quot; and &quot;Te Aviso, Te Anuncio&quot; are the Spanish versions of &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; and &quot;Objection&quot; and in some parts of &quot;Suerte,&quot; seem to flow better (probably because she wrote this songbefore &quot;Whenever Wherever&quot;). &quot;Te Aviso, Te Anuncio&quot; may have the same music but it is a different song then Objection (the lyrics aren't the same). So all in all, the CD is a must buy. The lyrics are poetic and there is music in here for everyones taste. And after listening to this cd, you too will say &quot;SHAKIRA ROCKS!&quot;
B000002O5L|5.0|This CD is fantastic, My favorite songs on it are I Won't Back Down, Runnin' Down A Dream and Free Fallin', the other songs are good too but they are just my favorites, but out of all his songs I think my # 1 favorite is I Won't Back Down, I like to listen to this wonderful song when I've had a bad day when someones trying to give me a hard time, etc. I highly recommend this CD it is just amazing!
B00005N9CV|5.0|I absolutely love the songs on this cd.<BR>I think Diane Krall has the sexiest voice<BR>I've ever heard. I also think the music is<BR>a perfect match for the voice. She is my very<BR>favorite female vocalist.
B000000WFU|1.0|I absolutely love The Pure Moods CD that Adiemus is on with their song called Adiemus so I bought this Adiemus Songs Of Sanctuary CD, well Adiemus is the only song I like, the rest are too new agey!
6305079811|5.0|This film is \\"almost\\" forgettable.<br />This film seems to have been slapped together in the wake of Lucas's revolution in sci-fi filmmaking.  The script is almost weak, the visual effects are almost there, and Flash Gordon (Sam J. Jones) almost has a personality.<br />Almost.<br />This film runs to the edge of oblivion, but here is what brings it back from the edge.<br />First, it is visually stunning.  They had perfect sets, perfect costumes, and perfect casting.  Having seen the original serials, I know of what I speak.  The visual impact of this moving is awesome, and many, many, if not all filmmakers can learn a thing or two from the visual aspect of this movie.<br />How to put the set design?  Art Deco on LSD seems the only appropriate jumble of words.<br />No, this is not Greg Toland in \\"Citizen Kane,\\" but it is more along the lines of Fritz Lang's Metropolis or M.  Few people know how to use the silver screen, and like a backwards philosopher's tone they create a lot of lead!<br />Second, the soundtrack.  We have Queen's electric guitar playing and the raunchy vocals of Freddy Mercury. This film foreshadowed their work on \\"Highlander.\\"  In no way does it detract from the film, but the punch rock rockets the movie along.<br />Third, the score.  Listen to the background music, the weird \\"space noises\\" reminiscent of \\"Forbidden Planet.\\"  It puts our soul on edge and reinforces the otherness of the alien ships.  Plus the wedding music is oddly appropriate-for a space wedding!<br />Fourth, the \\"before they were stars\\" factor. Yes, that is Timothy Dalton in those tights!<br />THE DVD:  This DVD is an absolutely bare bone DVD with no extras, Easter-eggs, or commentary.  My (...) version of Metropolis at least has the movie posters and short cast bios!  Something!  Anything!  All can say is that the copy to DVD is great-no static, scratches, or out of focus.
B000051Y0G|4.0|I like this CD and I like the fact that it has extra tracks that are not on our old cassette tape, the live versions of her big hits are awesome.
B00005QK3W|5.0|My first 45 RPM vinyl record was bought on 1978 and was &quot;Goodnight Tonight&quot;, by Wings. And by now, Sir James Paul returns with his best work since Venus And MArs or The Wings At The Speed Of Sound. The smile has gone. The partnerships with Stevie Wonder, Elvis Costello, Wacko Jacko has gone. Paul proves that he's a soulfull composer, singer and MUST BE respected for this britpop generation, that makes Radiohead and Travis gods. Without Paul's contribution, these bands would never come to play. This disc is awesome. Paul sings with angry, love and sadness. &quot;From A Lover To A Friend&quot; is one of the most beautiful love songs ever made, for a life-during wife and (girl)friend. The guitars are loud,this disc has soul! The title song has guitars progressions so mellow as summer breezes or driving raindrops. With Dylan's &quot;Love And Theft&quot;, this is the best album of this year.
B00000IMYA|5.0|I've always been semi-interested in the big bands, but never felt the sound quality of the recordings captured the real energy and musicianship of these wonderful performers.  Until now!  With some amazing technical wizardry and a fair amount of luck, we can enjoy this famous concert in its full stereo glory.  Absolutely crystal sound and all the driving force of Ellington's incredible band in full flight.  Without hesitation I call this CD one of the 2 or 3 greatest in all of jazz, and maybe in recorded music altogether.  Don't even think twice; order now.
B00005Q66T|3.0|For the average consumer who does not own Madonna's last 4 albums, this is a 5 star, excellent purchase and the ideal companion to 1990's ghv1: The Immaculate Collection. These are awesome, essential songs. However, for the Madonna fan it is an extremely disapointing 2 star purchase. There are no new tracks or alternate versions of songs here (Ex: &quot;Like a prayer&quot; and &quot;Express yourself&quot; from The Immaculate collection). The tracks are presented in a haphazard order instead of chronologicaly. The inclusion of a the beautiful, but horribly edited &quot;Don't cry for me Argentina&quot; is out of place and drags the whole thing down. It should have been replaced by either the dance remix of this song or &quot;You must love me&quot;; both of which were actually hits. In place of The Immaculate Collection's thoughtful commentary on the music is an insipid, not witty essay that reveals nothing about the music. The only plus to the presentation are the great cover picture and the thumbnail pics of Madonna's many looks. It would seem that Madonna had nothing to do with this release...and it shows. So...if you don't already own this material; but this CD now. If you do; skip it.
B00003CXCQ|4.0|The digitally remastered version of this classic is great.  There is such a big difference between watching this movie on DVD and then on video.  I couldn't believe the clear quality.  Definitely worth the purchase.
B000023VR6|4.0|pretty kool every song is great and youll be singin it on the bus
B00003CX5P|1.0|In short, this DVD will not be worth owning until there is the option to totally delete Jar Jar Binks from the movie. There was nothing wrong with the Gungans - in fact, I rather liked them (the normal ones that you could understand when they spoke, and who weren't shuffling, stumbling, mumbling idiots).<br />As a point of reference - I've seen Episodes 4, 5, &amp; 6 together more than 100 times, and have over 50 sci-fi movies in my DVD collection, but I'll never own or watch Episode 1 again until Jar Jar can be erased.
B000002UAX|5.0|&quot;The Beatles&quot; (aka &quot;The White Album&quot;) is one of the Beatles best albums.  I won't call it &quot;the best&quot; because each Beatles album is a unique experience.  The band was always changing and evolving. When they released an album, and you took it home to play it- they were already off into something new.  Their albums are like signposts along a highway.  Each signpost takes you a little further, but there's always the anticipation of something even better further along the road.<br />What makes &quot;The Beatles&quot; so special is its sheer exuberance! The band never played better rock 'n' roll.  It's like the cannabis fog which surrounded the band and its music since &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; dissipated a bit, and gave the boys clear enough heads to crank up the volume, speed up the beat, and drop Krishna for Chuck Berry!<br />Released in 1968, &quot;The White Album,&quot; unlike &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; or &quot;Revolver,&quot; doesn't sound dated.  The guitars never sounded better- crisp distortion replacing the jangly, trebly guitar sounds of the past.  George trades the sitar for the bluesiest, meanest leads of his career.<br />Like other Beatles albums, &quot;The Beatles&quot; illuminates the time in which it was recorded and released.  &quot;Revolver&quot; reflected the shimmering summer of '66, multi-colored miniskirts making their way down Carnaby Street.  &quot;Sgt. Pepper,&quot; in all its tie-dyed glory, celebrated the ill-fated &quot;Summer of Love&quot; in 1967.  &quot;The Beatles,&quot; in its complexity and contradictions, boldly reflects the student demonstrations, politcal unrest, domestic violence, and war of that turbulent year.
B00005R2M3|4.0|In my mind, this is good music. I may be biased because I'm in love with her, and yes their has been better, like her Latin hit CD &quot;Donde Estan Los Lardones&quot;, but for a girl who's first language is spanish and writes all hger own music, this is great. I Don't see at all why she's getting reviews like C- and two and a half stars out of five. In my mind, this is a flat B(comparitively to &quot;Donde Estan...&quot;)<BR>Now, i'll do this song by song.<br />&quot;Objection&quot;: Pretty good music, the lyrics need a little haelp and it could use a little more structure, but otherwise could be one of her next hits.<br />&quot;Underneath Your Clothes&quot;: Now this is why I admire her for her writing. This is a real love ballad, with her voice never more enthused about love.<br />&quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot;: Arguably the best song on the album. (aren't first sinles usually the best). A great rock/pop song with wonderful lyrics and beats.<br />&quot;Rules&quot;: She could do better. A song like this really doesn't grab you. Although the chorus is very good, the verse lyrics and beats could be better.<br />&quot;The One&quot;: Another real love ballad. Great lyrics. A little bit slower, but still a real rock song.<br />&quot;Ready For The Good Times&quot;: How else can I say it, but Shakira is SUCH a good writer. When one of my favorite song on the album talks about seven legged cats and you actually dance to the song (By the way, this is the dance song on the album if their is one) you know you habe a real signature artist here.<br />&quot;Fool&quot;: About being in love with someone who thinks your stupid(at leat that's what I think. The song is very good exept for the post chorus, an unmnessecary, drawn out &quot;Fooooooooooooooooooooooool, fool&quot;.<br />&quot;De Tajo Madrid&quot;: A good spanish song. Good beats, even though I don't know what she's saying. <br />&quot;Poem To A Horse&quot;: Good rocky song. Good lyrics about the aches of love.<br />&quot;Que Me Quedes Tu&quot; Pretty good. Can't understand her, but still a good song.<br />&quot;Eyes Like Yours&quot;: An English translation of &quot;Ojos Asi&quot;, perhaps her best spanish language song, translated by Gloria Estefan. It's great music, but it's missing a little bit of the magic that was in the original.<br />&quot;Suerte&quot;: See Review of &quot;Wherever, Whenever&quot;<br />&quot;Te Aviso, Te Anuncio&quot;: See review of &quot;Objection&quot;
B000050XEI|5.0|you have to realize that with each single off of this album she released two b sides.  That's 4 additional songs which are absolutely beautiful.  Also, on the Tiwanese release there is an additional song called &quot;Isobella&quot; which is truly amazing.  I love this album.  It is much more upbeat than &quot;Watermark&quot; and &quot;Shepherds Moon&quot;  I can't listen to it enough.  My only hope is that we don't have to wait another 5 or 6 years for a new album.
B00005R2M3|5.0|This album is great! This is her first English album and she does very well. The Spanish songs are also good. I think that she will be around a long time. She changed her theme to writing a little, but she still does great!!!
B00005R2M3|4.0|It took me awhile to get used to Shakira singing in English. But the more I spin the CD, the more I like it. Considering that she just learnt to speak English and wrote all the songs herself, this is quite a feat.<br />As a long time Shakira fan, I am delighted to say that this is a solid rock-pop album, with honest (although at times, clumsy) lyrics and the melding of diverse sounds such as rock guitar riffs, tango, and Andean flutes that will make you tap your hands on the dashboard as you drive to work (at least this what I did). Absent are any traces of cheesy, teenybopper songs (if this is what you're looking for, this is the not album for you).<br />The best songs on the CD are \\"Objection (tango)\\", \\"Whenever, Wherever\\", \\"Te dejo Madrid\\", \\"The One\\", and \\"Rules\\". The only song that I didn't care for was \\"Eyes like yours\\", the remake of \\"Ojos Asi\\". <br />Apart from the fact that Shakira is a very talented singer in her own right, she seems to be representing a rock phenomenon  (sort of) from Colombia. Recently, this country has been producing some first-class rock acts such as Los Aterciopelados and Juanes;  Shakira is at the helm.<br />Although this album pales in comparison to \\"Pies Descalzos\\" and \\"¿Dónde Están Los Ladrones?\\", it will not disappoint.<br />GET IT now!
B000001EYO|4.0|&quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; is one of my all-time favorite movies, and the music is integral to its mood and tenor, as is the case with most Cohen Brothers films.  While all of the music featured in the motion picture has not made it to the disc, what HAS been packaged as &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; soundtrack is an excellent and engaging album.<br />Standout tracks include &quot;Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In)&quot; by Kenny Rogers and the First Edition; &quot;My Mood Swings&quot; by Elvis Costello; and &quot;Hotel California&quot; by the Gypsy Kings.  This is a remarkably cohesive CD for one that represents such a wide spectrum of musical styles.<br />Several previous reviewers have commented that some of the best tracks from the film are not made available on the disc.  While this is certainly true - notable omissions include Creedence Clearwater Revival and Mozart tracks - it does not, in my opinion, diminish the album.  Is there room for a &quot;Volume 2&quot;?  Absolutely, but why not enjoy what's already available - you won't be disappointed.
B00003CXXJ|2.0|Prior to viewing \\"Shrek\\", I was intrigued by the animation I had seen in the previews and I had liked the idea it had of parodying fairy tales. I loved \\"The Princess Bride\\" and how it mocked the standard fairy tale in a way that both crucified the genre and honored it. It made fun of the frivolousness of the tales, but still also offered an experience that rivaled even the best traditional fairy tales. It was also a \\"family\\" movie and it managed at times to capture the grandeur of a fairy tale through the emotional attachment. A good story has to at least hit us on an emotional level. The score itself was moving enough to be worthy of a serious dramatic tale. \\"The Princess Bride\\" was a much better paced piece of work and did not attempt to simply crack jokes every few seconds as \\"Shrek\\" did. The major flaw of \\"Shrek\\" was that it tried to be too funny too often and managed little effective humor at all. The audience is numbed by the lack of emotion to counter all the frenzied dippy humor that no child could ever understand anyhow.<br />As well as the jokes being way too adult oriented than children could possibly understand, I was absolutely apalled by the music used in Shrek. I could understand pop music being used in Disney movies like \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" because those Disney movies always wound up being musicals anyway. At least in the case of those Disney movies the music had something to do with the movie. I cringed right off the bat when Smashmouth's \\"Allstar\\" started playing early in the movie. I thought,\\"Why use that in a movie about an ogre?\\" It had nothing to do with what was happening on the screen.<br />So watch \\"Shrek\\" once renting it and laugh at some of the adult oriented humor.(Some of it is funny) Quickly forget about what you saw because it sure wasn't anything memorable. The actual story of \\"Shrek\\" is weak to say the least. So \\"Shrek\\" winds up a mix of humor for adults with a (...) story for kids that moves at a pace of a Concorde jet. The salesare huge. I wonder why.(Sarcasm intended)
B00005Q66T|2.0|First of all the cd is called &quot;Greatest Hits Volume 2&quot; or GHV2. 4 of the songs aren't even hits! I don't know why Madonna insisted on adding the dreadful song &quot;Bedtime Story&quot; to this so-called hits compilation (This was after all her first major flop!) Her dreadful &quot;What it Feels Like for A Girl&quot; is the most boring non-hit of her career. &quot;Drowned World&quot; is a nice little song, but it wasn't a hit either (maybe in Latvia, but not here in the USA.) Also, the version of &quot;Don't Cry for Me Argentina&quot; included isn't the &quot;hit version&quot; either...If I remember correctly the hit was the remix version with the uptempo beat. This is the slow boring mix. I also have to deduct points for not including at least 1 new song. The only reason to buy this would be for a new song, but she didn't even bother. It looks like Madonna has gotten lazy. This release is only for the die-hard-collect-all-things-by-Madonna-fan. By the way, there are already used copies for sale on this site....after 1 day of release. I rest my case.
B00005QK3W|3.0|Here it is; Paul's first release of new original material in over 4 years.  Was it worth the wait?  <br />The CD certainly has some things going for it.  Wings and Paul's world tour band of the late eighties and early 90s were certainly &quot;good&quot; bands - tight, with everything well-placed - and Hamish was the best harmony vocalist Paul had worked with since, well, you know.  But it seems the musicians assembled for this album, none of whom I've heard of, are allowed a lot of freedom in the arrangements, which results in a rather &quot;new&quot; sound.  The musicianship seems inspired, and Paul responds by delivering some of his best bass playing in years. Also, there are some really good songs on the album.  Lonely Road is heartfelt and plaintive. From a Lover to a Friend is pleasant enough, but I don't see why it would be considered as a single.  It just isn't that strong.  Much better would be Driving Rain or even Tiny Bubble.  Also, Riding Into Jaipur is a neat exercise in modality, but short on words.<br />But, what has happened to Paul's sense of subtly?  Though the band's playing is inspired, the arrangements that made such albums as Ram and Tug of War such a pleasure to listen to are gone.  Maybe the problem is the lack of really strong songs.  There are only a couple of songs that I really don't like (She's Given Up Talking and Spinning On An Axis, for sure), but there are no songs that I really love.  <br />What has happened to Paul's sense of humor?  What made songs like Uncle Albert and Monkberry Moon Delight great was their sense of fun.  Lyrically, Paul has never been a Dylan, but he had a humor and narrative style that was appealing.  Both seem to be gone.  Many of these songs seem unfinished, underdeveloped lyrically.<br />No one could expect the man to continue to kick out classics like Here, There and Everywhere, For No One, hey, even Silly Love Songs.  Don't get me wrong, there are some good songs here.  There's just no great ones.  And, hey, this guy's got one of the greatest pop voices ever.  Why does he insist on constantly singing at the very top of his range, where his voice has been most ravaged by time?  In the middle of his range, he sounds just fine.  So, why does he make us cringe by really straining to sing in the stratosphere?<br />With the impressiveness of Bob Dylan's recent release, I think my expectations of this album were heightened.  Too bad.  Please don't ask me to compare the two albums.  Dylan is going through a creative renaisance, and uses his aging voice so well.<br />I really wish I could say the same for Paul McCartney.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Simply put, 'Shrek' is an *amazing* movie.  It has wit, humor, heart, intergrity, morales, lessons, positive messages, etc.  'Shrek' is a very unique comedy as it is enjoyable to both young and old.  Kids get a fun and cute warped fairy tale, while adults get a deeper meaning about acceptance of one another.  The humor 'Shrek' is just fantastic!  'Shrek' mocks Disney movies, The Matrix, Riverdance, and more!  The mocking isn't malicious, just cute and *hilarious*!<br />Cameron Diaz, Mike Myers, and Eddie Murphy are amazing!  Their voices really bring their special characters alive.  The animation is fantastic!  The soundtrack is upbeat and fun with a few songs by Smash Mouth.  The 'Shrek' soundtrack is defintely a personal favorite of mine.  The DVD is just spectacular with the most special features, games, and bonus materials that I have ever seen on a DVD!  Just fantastic!
B000002U8G|4.0|Many folks, me included, can tell you the exact time and place they first heard Meddle. Of all the Pink Floyd recordings, this may be my favorite, but I have to confess that it sounds a bit dated these days. Still, the music here captures the band at a moment when their early experimentalism, which reached its nadir with &quot;Atom Heart Mother,&quot; and the bloated excess of their stadium rock such as &quot;Animals&quot; are kept at bay. There is a bit of everything here, from the lilting San Tropez, to the playfulness of Fearless, to the masterful water-pipe ode Echoes.<br />If you don't have this PF CD, you should. The boys are in fine form here, letting their strong musical talents push the music. The studio hijinx so lauded on &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; and the subsequent body of their work can be detected here, but these are kept in check.
B00005T30L|5.0|High School wasn't all that long ago for me, the daily endeavor to remain an individual in the midst of so much conformity, the use of sardonic and sarcastic quips to keep the world at bay. The life of a pragmatic outsider was the life I led then, and I suppose I still do now. Enter Ghost World, a brilliant piece of cinematic rebellion seemingly made just for people like me, a film that deftly explores the alienation some, if not all of us feel at times.<BR> Enid (Thora Birch), a freshly graduated high school senior, is a girl surrounded by the shallow, meaningless, constantly fading ghost world of pop culture. A teenager tortured by the perpetually perky attitudes of everyone in the world around her, a realist in a world where optimistic slavishness to the status quo is treasured above all else, whose world comes crashing down around her when her best friend/foil (Scarlett Johansson) begins to play the game of the social order for which Enid holds such contempt. Unable to stomach the idea of following her friend into this nightmare world, Enid turns for companionship to aging individualist Seymour (Steve Bucemi, in a performance so good that anything less than a nomination is, in my opinion, a criminal act on the part of the academy), a vintage record collector and white collar middle manager who seems unsure of himself and his station in life, who longs for the companionship that would come so naturally with fitting in while simultaneously despising himself for that same yearning. The characters come together naturally, drifting in and out of each others respective lives and scopes of influence. <BR>The story, something so seemingly straightforward, is complicated by the fact that this is a movie about human beings, not caricatures, it takes these people time to come to terms with each other, to grow to understand and appreciate each other, and to grow apart when circumstances force it. This is a personal tale, a deeply involving character study on how individualism can be both a curse and a blessing, and how its effects carry influence even into later life.<BR> Using its subject both for drama and comedy, Ghost World is able to create some of the most cutting satire to come out of a film this year. Writer/Director Terry Zwigoff (Crumb) and his co-writer Daniel Clowes present us with a brilliant script that unifies the outlook of the film with the one shared by the characters at its center. It is a testament to the talent of both writers that an affecting and dramatic story can carry with it such deadpan sarcasm and subversion without self destructing.<BR> Ghost World is a unique film about unique people. It is a quirkily dramatic satire of strange and original proportions. It is a film that is sure of itself, of its tone, and of its content. Still, what stands out most of all is its brutal, sometimes painful, and always unflinching honesty towards its characters and its plot.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Oops, she did it again. She made a CD. It's the best of the three! Oh baby, baby. Oops, she thinks she's soo hot and she's sent from above. She's not so innocent---anymore. Britney's back!<BR>Her new album shws that she is grown up and can do a lot of more things than she did in the past. Her voice is amazing. I highly reccomend you buy this album, because to what she says, it seems like this alum relates to her so well. She is so &quot;Overprotected&quot; and yet &quot;Anticipating&quot; to &quot;Not Be A Girl, But A Woman!&quot; Good luck Britney on all of your other albums.

B00005NI5Y|5.0|Åt 60 Bob Dylan has produced one of the best collections of his long and prolific career. These songs rock! Ya gotta get up and dance to some of them, that's how rockin' they are. Other tracks are poignant, all are haunting in one way or another. This is a showcase of the variety of musical forms Dylan has mastered: from rock to blues to sweet old-fashioned crooners. Just superb.
B00005JKHP|5.0|Star Trek:  The Motion Picture was, until now, a classic example of a film which suffered from a rushed post-production.  It is well known in ST fandom how the film that was originally hired to do the effects for this movie bascially fell flat on their collective face, leaving Robert Wise and Co. with only a few months to start from scratch on their effects, and a release date that was carved in stone.  They went to superhuman effort in order to get everything done by the deadline, and they barely made it.  The final effects sequences actually had to be physically spliced into hundreds of copies of the film, right before their delivery to theaters!  The fact that the effects were as good as they were is truly miraculous.  This is the most cinematic of all the ST movies to date, although The Wrath of Khan comes pretty close.  The soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith is one of the GREATEST film scores ever.<br />Of course, the main feature of this DVD is the fact that Robert Wise got to go back and take his time re-doing the effects scenes that he had to rush through in 1979, and then insert them seamlessly into the scenes shot 20 years ago, and make it all fit.  Overall, it works extremely well.  Some of my favorite improvements:<br />(1)  The star field effects over the overture theme and opening credits - Sure, the moving star field over SF movies has been done many times since, but Star Trek invented it.  The opening wasn't complete without it.  The credits themselves have also been re-worked.  The opening credits were one place where the post-production rush in 1979 really showed.  It was a nice touch to clean this up.<br />(2)  The scenes on Vulcan - Vulcan looks more &quot;Vulcan-like&quot; now, and the removal of the moon seen previously makes the film conform to previously-established Star Trek canon.  Another nice touch that is important for continuity.  Also, the Vulcan subtitles have been re-worded just a bit to make it a little less obvious that the Vulcans werereally just speaking electronically-distorted English.<br />(3)  The new shots of Starfleet Headquarters - totally awesome improvement to another casualty of the 1979 rush.  As much as I loved that shot of the Starfleet Headquarters seal, it was painfully obvious that some missing effects shots were here.  Also, the scene between Kirk and Sonak has been re-done to make the landing area seem much larger.  Nice echoing to the dialogue.<br />(4)  Insertion of some original-series sound effects, particularly the transporter operation.<br />(5)  The scenes when they flew through the cloud and over V'ger were tightened up a bit.  Good editing, these secnes were DEFINITELY too long originally.  Thank God, though, they left the Enterprise inspection/flyover alone!  This is one scene that was just fine all along, and they wisely didn't cut it at all.<br />(6)  When you look out the windows of the officer's lounge, you can now see the warp nacelles.  Nice touch.<br />(7)  The scenes of V'ger attacking the Earth.  I always wanted to see a shot of the whole thing at once!<br />(8)  The new shots inside V'ger - It's pretty obvious that these are CG, but the creation of the bridge between the Enterprise and V'ger is pretty cool anyway.<br />(9)  But, the absolute BEST improvement was the re-working of the Red Alert klaxon and the removal of that infuriatingly annoying computer voice.  I got so tired of hearing that thing go &quot;Travel pod available, Cargo 6&quot;, and &quot;Intruder Location.  A Sonic Shower.&quot;, and &quot;Red. Alert. Red. Alert.  The Ship.  Is On.  Red. Alert!&quot;  If they did nothing else to the movie, this alone would make the DVD worth buying.  Thank you Mr. Wise!<br />The DVD also contains a bunch of bonus features, including the original scenes that were edited, the delightfully cheesy movie trailers and TV commercials, and the scenes that were added for the 1983 TV version and then re-dropped.  Some of those scenes were kinda nice, but they didn'treally do anything for me.  The worst one was the shot of Kirk leaving the Enterprise in pursuit of Spock.  You can see the scaffolding on the set!  They're baically non-essential, but it's nice to have them anyway.  The TV commercials are a lot of fun to watch.<br />This is not the best ST move by any stretch, but it's MUCH better than its detractors think.  If you haven't seen it in a while, now is the perfect chance to see it again.  The acting is great.  If the actors seem uneasy at first, that's because the CHARACTERS are uneasy due to the myraid conflicts that they are undergoing as the movie begins.  As the conflicts are resolved, they get more comfortable.  It's truly a great SF movie.  Pick it up!<br />Oh and Emma, if you're out there, sounds like you got a defective case.  Return it and get another copy.
B00005214X|5.0|This classic album by George Harrison has deserved a solid re-mastering for CD for years. Now we've got it, with extra tracks and a new version of My Sweet Lord as well!
B000002UJQ|4.0|This album is a masterpiece! many say similar to Pink Floyd. Its definitly in my top 5
B00004Z459|5.0|This is by far the coolest cd I have ever heard. Chester Bennington and Mike Shinoda sound really cool together and Brad Delson is the reason I'm starting to play guitar. They have an awesome DJ (Joseph, I mean MR.Hahn)Cure for the itch is really awesome! It's the song that got me into all the scratching and stuff.What can I say? I love this band. From 1-5 stars they deserve a 47!!!!!!
B000053VBL|5.0|Based on the novel of the same name, this film is a razor sharp depiction of one woman's relentless pursuit of her newly wedded and deaded husband's killers.  Cornell Woolrich was THE quintessential noir fiction writer, the master of savage irony, and this is, without question, one of the best translations of his work into film.<br />Jeanne Moreau brings out the fanatic dedication of the main character--as schoolteacher, vixen, artist's model--whatever it takes, she will find and destroy the killers.  Even in prison, she manages to kill.  Her impassive demeanor is a perfect representation of the Woolrich ethos--that life in its unpredictability will change you so dramatically that there is no chance in hell you will ever be the same as you were before.<br />The killers are all regular guys who never suspect a thing--because they're not professional criminals, they have no reason to be looking over their shoulders.  The various methods the Moreau character uses to dispatch the men are clever and intriguing.<br />Truffaut's sharp eye for character detail is an exact match with Woolrich's mordant eye for plotting.  The two together make for a tough, engaging film that still rings true after more than 30 years.
0451169514|4.0|A long time ago I picked up the book It and got through the first chapter and put it down.  It was a bit slow for a nine year old.  Several years later, 11 to be exact, I tried it again.  This time I didn't put it down until I was finished.<br />After I read the book I rented the movie and was extremely disappointed.  The movie hardly followed the book at all and when it did, it made it a laughing stock.  A lot of my peers told me that the movie scared them to death but I don't understand it.  The book however was enough to move me.  <br />Disgust, horror, sadness, joy this book made me feel all of them.  It starts off a little slow but it moves along at a steady pace after you get to know the characters.  Pennywise is one of the few villains which encompasses all that we are scared of and consider malevolent.  <br />The book switches between telling the story of when the characters were children and current day.  It shows how they relate their experiences to their past and dredge up forgotten nightmares.  <br />The reason I gave this book only four stars instead of five is because there is a scene which I found overtly obscene and it made me feel nasty just reading it.  This may be the point of most occurences in a Stephen King book but this particular scene plays under the pretense of being full of goodness and love.  I found it hard to sympathize however.  <br />All in all, this is a great book and it'll make you squirm. If you're already sqeamish, it'll make you scream.
B00005QK3W|5.0|having been fortunate enough to 'have' this album for several weeks already (sans the last minute addition of 'Freedom') I admit the first time I heard Driving Rain, it was so different from what I was anticipating it was going to be, I was close to dismissing it.  But giving it a second, third, fourth (and so on) run through, I must say this is possibly Macca's most consistent outing ever.  There isn't a dud track in the whole lot of 16 tracks.  The only other McCartney album I can say that about is RAM, even Band on the Run has 'No Words' which is a bit of a lame duck.<BR>  Driving Rain, is a fairly raw production, which is refreshing after all the overly produced albums of the eighties and early nineties.  If there is a flaw in Driving Rain, it is in the sequencing of the tracks, since Heather, Riding to Jaipur and Rinse the Raindrops which all have minimalistic lyrical content, are placed within a 5 track span of each other creating a bit of an imbalance with the first 2/3 of the album. <BR>  But all in all this album bests his last 'original' album Flaming Pie, which contained many outstanding tracks, but also had a few duds to way it down.  In fact, Driving Rain, as cliche as it has become to say so amongst McCartney fans, is honestly his best album since Band on the Run.
B000050XEI|5.0|I have been a fan of Enya for the past several years and own her entire collection. The first time I heard &quot;Only Time&quot; in trailers for Sweet November, it sent shivers through me...and still does. Her voice is so haunting and goes into your very soul. An EXCELLENT CD...as always!
0783116934|4.0|&quot;Citizen X&quot; is probably the best film about a serial killer, ever made. It doesn't glorify the killer (as does the revolting &quot;Henry:Portrait of a Serial Killer&quot;), nor does it turn the killer into a Luciferian, James Bond-style super villain (as in the excellent &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;). What it does depict is a dogged investigator doing his best, against all odds, to stop a twisted, demented, savage (but all too human) murderer from practiceing his craft.<BR>  But, what truly sets this film apart are the uniformally excellent performances. Donald Sutherland does some of his best work as the local militia (this being the former Soviet Union read &quot;militia&quot; as &quot;police&quot;) commander, trying to balance good police work against political expediancy. Max von Sydow is brilliant as a psychiatrist who, unwittingly, stumples across the concept of psychological profiling without ever having met anyone from the FBI (or even Jodie Foster, for that matter). Joss Ackland is very good as a nasty, opportunistic Soviet commisar with a secret; as is Imelda Staunton as the investigators long suffering, understanding (but always believable) wife.<BR>  The ultimate praise, however, must go to the  actors who actually play the cat and mouse in the film. Jeffrey DeMunn, as Andrei Chikatilo (still the most &quot;successful&quot; serial killer known), is totally believable as a man who, in the blink of an eye, shifts from pathetic, brow-beaten milquetoast to savage , amoral predator. And, finally, as Detective Burakov, Stephen        Rea       <BR>is simply stunning. The moment, when Sutherland tells him that his techniques have been taught at the FBI academy (after years of seclusion behind the Iron Curtain) is absolutely shattering. Reas performance is one of the finest pieces of acting ever put on screen... TV or film...bar none.
B00005QK3W|3.0|First off, there is no accounting for taste, judging by most of the other reviews on this subject. If you can listen to a CD while ignoring it has any lyrics, then this CD is alright. Just alright. By far, not his best, fortunately not his worst. Otherwise, this is filled with some of the most elementary, uninspired, banal, embarrassing lyrics ever from Paul--all the way through. And we all know Paul has a boatload of that already. He did just put out a poetry book, can't he connect the two mediums more often? With all that has gone on in his life lately...this is all he has to say? Perhaps he should just record a few more instrumental tracks instead, because the best tracks on this collection are all the ones with the fewest words. Obviously he NEEDS a Lennon/Costello/etc writing partner to edit the free flowing lyric drivel that naturally comes out of his head along with all that great music. It is good to hear him rocking more, but then I just cringe when he starts singing again. There is no &quot;Maybe I'm Amazed&quot; here--not even close. Buy this to keep your Macca collection current, but if you are after a great CD...try Sugar &quot;Copper Blue&quot; instead, or Badfinger &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;...now THOSE are 5 star discs!
B000002UJQ|5.0|This is probably my favorite CD (and if you like this one, I would highly recommend the Iron Lung import). It takes a few listens to really appreciate it, but once you recognize its genius, it's hard not to be blown away.  In my opinion, this is where Radiohead peaked, after the primarily rock and roll sound and before the too techno current sound (although I love all their stuff).  The only sad thing is that everything you listen to post-OK Computer pales a little bit in comparison--they've really raised the bar for great music.
B000021YQV|5.0|Thats all I can say about this cd. I haven't listened to metal for long but this band is easily the best I've come across. I thought this cd would be like all the other metal cds I have. I was wrong. This cd has almost its own style of music. Also its songs have strange meaning I haven't heard from any other bands. From &quot;Prison Song&quot;'s hate of the U.S. prison system to &quot;Pyscho&quot;'s displaying the life of a cocaine addict.
B00000DATR|4.0|Nothing Mike does will top the sheer inventiveness of the original, and it would take very little to better the dreadful \\"Tubular Bells 2.\\" Here, Mike has succeeded in producing an adequate (if less memorable than some of his others) album that isn't reminiscent of the previous two. This is more in keeping with his \\"Islands/Heaven's Open\\" period, featuring a mix of pop tunes and short instrumentals. While not terribly inspired (but hey--even at his worst,  Oldfield's still better than most of the cookie-cutter garbage out there), there are a few real standouts among the tracks. <BR>\\"Outcast\\" features Mike at his guitar-blazing best, a raging instrumental full of fire and passion. Mike is a talent with numerous instruments (see the original Tubular Bells), and his proficiency with the guitar is showcased here. <BR>\\"Man in the rain\\" is the album's most pop-oriented track, featuring longtime Oldfield vocalist Anita Hegerland on a song reminiscent of \\"Moonlight Shadow.\\" It's pretty standard stuff, but entertaining and worth a listen. <BR>The best instrumental on the album, \\"Top of the morning\\" is a thundering (though repetitive, but I'm not complaining) piano work. My favorite. <BR>The last track, \\"Far above the clouds,\\" begins slowly, with a short spoken piece by a child (one of Mike`s?), then it's three minutes or so of instrumental explosion--guitars, piano and keys, drums, and of course, tubular bells. It's also repetitive, but never boring, and a  good send-off for the album.<BR>I also enjoyed the eerie \\"Serpent dream\\" and the slightly creepy \\"Inner Child.\\"<BR>This is certainly an improvement on part 2, and although flawed, it's worth a look. Longtime Oldfield fans might be frustrated by the occasional unevenness of the material, but again, it's not bad.

B00003XACV|5.0|I can't say enough about this score- it has a sounds that is completely fresh, and like nothing I've heard in movie scores before. Newman's use of diverse instruments and &quot;world&quot; rhythms is exciting and evocative. I highly recommend this even for the few folks who haven't seen &quot;American Beauty&quot;.
B00005QK3W|5.0|Paul has arrived.  He rocks harder than any Beatle and has written some of the best songs of his career, many of which could fit nicely on the White Album.  The song FREEDOM, alone, is worth the price of the album and compares to the best of his Beatles' music.  Other highlights include Lonely Road, Your Way, Tiny Bubble, I do, Back in the Sunshine Again and of course the ten minute rocker, Rinse the Raindrops.
6304119046|4.0|&quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, based loosely, on the life of newspaper publisher W. R. Hurst, is as controversial a film as it is important.  Orson Welles is supurb in the leading role, portraying the rags to riches newspaper publisher who becomes more stingy and cold as his riches and popularity, and power, increase.<br />New techniques in film making, also Welles doing, gives the movie more depth.  Fast cuts, and overlapping dialogue are Welles doing.  Watch for the close ups, and scenes where the camera pans directly down from the ceiling - also Welles innovation.  They are standard now, but never would have been but for Welles.<br />The story begins with Kane on his deathbed, uttering that immortal and illusive word &quot;rosebud&quot;.  He dies.  No sooner than he is buried than an extensive search is made to discover what the meaning of &quot;rosebud&quot; is.  Newspaper reporters visit close friends, and distant enemies of Kane to gather insight.  <br />Now, the movie changes.  A biography of the man's life is unfolded, unraveled, and, at times, maliciously documented; and depending on who is telling the story, Kane is either hero or villian.<br />We see Kane as a little boy, being dragged away from his parents to live in wealth and comfortability.  He does not want to leave his mother; though it is at her insisting he leave, for the sake of his future.  The frame cuts, and it is now 20 years later, and enter Orson Welles.  Kane is a young man now, headstrong, ambitious, and power hungry; a shell of the innocent boy we saw only minutes earlier.  His life has changed.  But is it what his mother had wanted?<br />Throughout the rest of the film, Kane ages as fast as his character develops more hunger and thirst for power, always putting his work ahead of friends and family; lusting for more, more, more, and never satisfied ... until he ultimately destroys himself.<br />The movie can be a bit long at times, and, as I have done, have the viewer fidgeting in his seat, wondering when the action will pick up.  However, that is the movie's only flaw.  I found &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; to be a great pyschological drama which I have enjoyed watching many times.
B00005ALP6|5.0|(. . .)Watch the movie twice, three times... look for the subtle and not-so-subtle comments about class systems, gender roles, and the realities of the haves and have-nots. It parodies and lampoons, using irony and sarcasm in the midst of wit.<br />It is an odd movie in that it brings both the stereotypical liberal and conservative messages to the table.... hammering half of those messages and supporting the other half. Funky, huh?<br />The linguists and poetics in this engaging musical will pull in the most erudite bookworm, without insulting the less avid reader.<br />Based on George Bernand Shaw's famous play, \\"Pygmalion\\", which, in turn, is based on a famous myth about the love between Pygmalion and Galatea, is thoroughly literary. Charged with archetypal questions, it does not preach, but shows what it wants to say, letting the viewer decide.<br />OK... I'm done with all that intellectual hoity-toity stuff...<br />Audrey Hepburn is incredible, showing us that classic beauty is more than a smile. Effervescent and light, she tells us \\"The rain in Spain...\\" You know the rest. Whether she is a Hungarian princess or a flower-selling street girl, she shines with glamour and dignity.<br />Harrison, likewise, is grand as linguist of world-wide proportions. He delivers his lines with delectable articulancy, taking on hard monologues as if they were children's verses.<br />Love is defined here awkwardly... is it because they are used to each other, need each other, attracted to each other? Is it because they are unimaginably incapable of living their lives without each other? Love is never as simple in real life as it is often protrayed: but not here! You'll soak in the full breadth of love's complexities.<br />Enjoy this movie. I fully recommend \\"My Fair Lady.\\"<br />Anthony Trendl
B00005OM4N|3.0|As a major fan of Britney I'd been eagerly awaiting her new album.  Even after hearing the disappointing single &quot;Slave 4 U&quot;, I held out hope for a good album.  I should have known better after hearing all the hype about her 'growing' and getting to take the album in her own direction.  This album is quite forgettable and ultimately I think the responsibility for that is Britney's.  Unfortunately we all live in a pop culture that wants our icons to be everything to us - our athletes must be rappers, our pop stars actors, our leaders attractive, etc.  Britney has succumbed to this same demand.  With no disrespect to her at all, Britney is a pop singer.  I do not see evidence of her skills as a writer, producer, or manager.  There is nothing wrong with that.  Excellence in one field is sufficient.  The downfall is this album is the desperation to 'grow' as she and everyone else puts it.  I challenge that as a fallacy anyway.  Why do we want or need her to grow?  We like her for who she is and what she has done.  I am not suggesting a musical stagnation, simply a focus on the elements that make Britney into Britney Spears the pop star.  <BR>       Foremost is her voice and the way it is used, excuse me, was used.  The production of this album has left her with a very flat range; I don't hear the excitement, the coyness, the sparkle, the flirtatiousness, or even the high-pitched girlishness that exemplified her previous work.  I have never listened to Britney for the messages in her songs - only to share in that exuberance that oozed from her music...and it's gone.  &quot;Anticipation&quot; is the only song that will keep this CD in my changer for another couple of weeks after that there isn't anything to enjoy.<BR>      If you desire to hear an artist who really has moved into a more mature style and sound without abandoning the elements that made her so endearing, pick up Mandy Moore's newest album.  It is truly worthy of your time and admiration.
0395645662|5.0|I first read this book when I was ten years old and it gave me a whole new world to think about. As I reread it, I'm stunned by the even deeper levels that come across. It's a disquieting, but provoking read. This isn't recommended for general bedtime reading, but it is a wonderful book to share with your child.
B00005NP04|5.0|Martina has one of the most beautiful voices in country music today.  Matched with a great selection of songs and you have a great album.  This is a &quot;must have&quot; selection for anyone who likes a little bit o' country with a little bit o' rock &amp; roll.
B000059MPH|4.0|Agatha Christie wrote &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; in 1937, one year after &quot;Murder in Mesopotamia&quot;, and to all appearances &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; was intended as a prequel to &quot;Murder in Mesopotamia&quot;, which itself was a prequel to the 1934 classic &quot;Murder in the Orient Express&quot;. The three stories make up a satisfying trilogy of mysteries as Poirot tours the Near East finding murder everywhere he goes.<br />All three of the stories follow Christie's tried-and-true formula: She introduces the cast of suspects, gives each of them a dark secret and a motive to lie, and piles up the circumstances in such a way that the flying fickle finger of suspicion points to every one of them at some time or another. She compounds the confusion by supplying false leads and deliberatly glossing over hot clues. In each case Poirot holds his cards close to his vest, tantalizes the reader/listener with cryptic comments, and finds the most inconsequential-appearing facts to be highly significant. Eventually Poirot airs everyone's dirty laundry, explains his chain of deductive reasoning, reconstructs the crime in all its improbable complexity, and gets a confession.<br />Of the three stories, however, &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; presents the most feasible modus operandi for the murder, as well as the most likely motivation for murder. This is a roudabout way of saying that &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; is the most realistic of the three.<br />The Peter Ustinov movie stays faithful to the plot and gives the viewer some excellent scenes of Egyptian ruins along the Nile.  The star-studded cast turns in good performances.  Having first seen David Suchet as Poirot, I could not help but be somewhat disappointed with Peter Ustinov as Poirot.  Of all the Poirot movies starring Ustinov, however, this is the best.
B0000009SY|5.0|How can I describe this one? For Zappa Fans, it's easy, but to the uninitiated? My friends, prepare for the unexpected and the &quot;impossible.&quot; Your world may change with the concepts expressed herein. Frank and his central scrutinizer will take you through every crack and crevice beginning with solid, humble, and comfortable surroundings. Don't be falsely secure by this, the road gets rough ahead. You will grow up quickly listenly to the mature themes expressed through lyrics. I think Frank assembled some of the best musicians in the world. From a production standpoint it was flawlessly, crystal-clearly cut. As a whole, this something totally different. Pick up this album and be rewarded with the sounds of a true innovator in the rock/concept album genre. Oh yeah, &quot;Watermelon&quot; is a great!  solo.
B000002513|4.0|When this album first came out, I couldn't get it off my turntable. It was almost like a soundtrack of my 2nd and 3rd years in college. Bruce put together an awesome collection of songs, performed with passion and energy. Then in 1975, he hit the big time...he released \\"Born to Run\\". And that became the reference point....Bruce before and after the fame. For all of its beauty, its majesty, its sheer brilliance, one can only wonder what this, his second album, could have been if: 1.) he had a decent producer in 1973, and 2.) he had found Max Weinberg and Roy Bittan in time to record this album. This is why this album, which is still one of my all-time favorites, gets 4 stars and not 5. First of all, Mike Appel and Louis Lahav did an awful job of producing and engineering this album. The beautiful \\"New York City Serenade\\" is recorded so sloppily, you can hear the conga playing by Richard Blackwell fade in and out at the beginning. I have never thought that Vini Lopez was anywhere near a decent drummer. On this album, he is just plain sloppy. One can see why Bruce fired him and brought in Mighty Max. There is no comparison. And as for David Sancious, his playing was too jazzbo for me. I always felt that Sancious' contributions to this effort and Bruce's career at that time were way overrated. Danny Federici was the real keyboard anchor in those days. Sancious? Great talent, but Roy is a much more melodic player; Roy fits Bruce's music better.<br />What I used to love about this album began to distract me after I heard just how horribly produced it was next to the albums that came later. That doesn't take away from its ranking as a great album. But when you consider that after this brilliant effort came out, Bruce still was struggling, you can see part of the reason why. But don't let that deter you. This is a great album. An artist who was 2 years from the brink of greatness. Wonderful songs; side 2 was the launching pad for what was to come next. That entire side is one of the most cohesive pieces of music Bruce has ever recorded. It's just too bad that the horrible engineering, a pig-headed producer/manager and a couple of misplaced band members cast a shadow over an otherwise great album. On 11/14/01, I gave it 4 stars; in retrospect, it deserves more. The passion is there, the instinct for real rock'n'roll is there, the creative genius is there. The production values are missing.<br />Early E Street, interesting for what was yet to come. Buy it, enjoy it, and revel in the artist as a young man.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Recent animated movies like Shrek are wildly compelling to watch.  How do they get such a strong 3-D effect in a cartoon?  Couple the amazing visuals with a very funny story and vocal cast, and you have the recipe for a great move.  This is a great movie for grownups.  The humor is timely and mostly clean.  (Apparently some kids like the movie too)  Sit back and enjoy a masterful comedy.  It's a great laugh and relaxing escape for the whole family.
0064407667|5.0|In the beginning of this book the Baudelaire children's parents parish in a terrible house fire. They find out by their parents good friend Mr. Poe who is a banker for the city bank. The children were very upset. They stayed with Mr. Poe for one night. Then in the morning he took them to a near by relative (their parents had requested that the stay with a relative) their new guardian was called Count Olaf. This man was very cruel to the children. He made them make their own meals and for him and his theatre troupe. They made them a meal and the men didn't like it so they had to make them another meal. Every miring Count Olaf made them a list of jobs to do each day. All of their chores were hard for any child to do.<br />I really didn't like the way Count Olaf treated the children. He treated them very badly. He would beat them if they didn't do their chores good enough. He also supplied them with a very old crummy bed with lumps and the springs were sticking out also. I also liked the way Klaus thinks out his plans to stop Count Olaf.<br />The protagonists, Violet, Klaus and Sunny, all hate Count Olaf. They all try to contact Mr. Poe at the bank but he just doesn't believe that he is that cruel to them. Also they protect their fortune. They never give up with any thing either. <br />The Baudelaire children are brave. The always-out wit Count Olaf in hide plans to steal their fortune. I wouldn't like to be them! It would be such a hard time for me to have my parents die in a fire and try to protect their fortune. I would of given up the first day. This situation would be too tough for me. I encourage you to read the book the Bad Beginning!
B00005QK3W|4.0|16 songs, way too much!!! Instead of a decent 16 song album, this would be a very good 10-12 song album, or even a great 8-10 song album. Paul is simply too diverse (and good) for his own good. The songwriting ranges from poor like &quot;Spinning on an Axis&quot; to great. The perfromance, especially Paul's bass playing is top notch, as is the production. A few contemporary and experimental sounds are an upgrade from the sterile sound many of Paul's works suffer from. It's not &quot;Band On The Run&quot; with catchy pop singles, but many good songs such as &quot;She's Given Up Talking&quot; and &quot;Lonely Road.&quot; My personal favorite is the Indian flavored &quot;Riding Into Jaipur&quot;<br />I'm not sure if McCartney fans will like this or not. I do, there is plenty of great material here. I as a fan, do like it, but there are 2 or 3 clunkers that distract from the greatness and creative talent of Paul McCartney who is arguably one of the all-time greats.
B00000J2PH|5.0|There seems to be thousands of recordings on Amazon which reviewers apparently rate 5 stars. At the time of my writing this, Tapestry is not listed as one of them! To not give this record 5 stars is like saying Beethoven's 5th symphony is not good music or saying Michael Jordan is not a great basketball player just because you don't like basketball.<br />Tapestry is a true classic. King's songwriting is awesome, probably the best female songwriter ever. She doesn't have the greatest natural voice but there is a sincere human and vulnerable quality to it which is compelling. Add to that the punchy consummate piano style and arrangements and we have one of the all time great records.
B00005NWM3|4.0|If you like Nickleback, you'll like this.  A few real gems like &quot;Too Bad&quot; stick out the first time, but it doesn't take long to realize the whole CD is a good listen for just about any occasion.  Not for those who like to pick apart their music for neat compositional tricks and deep lyrics, but quite enjoyable nonetheless.
0141301074|4.0|Have you ever seen a married couple who hate each other? Or have you ever seen trained upside-down monkeys that revolt? In this book The Twits by Roald Dahl it happens! Mr. and Mrs. Twits are the nastiest, ugliest, smelliest people in the world. They hate everything except playing jokes on each other! Mr. Twit loves bird pie (with real birds in it!) and training monkeys to do everything upside-down. Mrs. Twit plays the first joke in this book, The Twits and it gets Mr. Twit really mad! The tricks go back and forth between them until Mr. Twit plays the ultimate trick he says that she has the shrinks! (The shrinks is where is your head grows into your neck, your neck grows into your middle, your middle grows into your legs, and your legs grow into your feet!)<BR>Next its time to tell you about the monkeys! Mr. Twit is training his monkeys to do everything upside-down. But alas the monkeys want to go home to Africa. (They hate doing things upside down.)  One day a bird native to Africa, the Roly-Poly Bird comes to visit. Then the monkeys play a trick on the Twits!  The Roly-Poly Bird, from Africa, lets them out of their cage.  The monkeys seize the moment to play the trick.  They take the very, very sticky glue out of Mr. Twit's shed.  (He uses it to catch birds for bird pie on Tuesdays.)  Then the monkeys stick everything to the ceiling in the Twit's house exactly how it was on the floor.  When the Twits come home and go inside they think they're on the ceiling so they stand on their heads and then they get the shrinks, for real!<BR>This book is great for laughs it makes you laugh like a laughing hyena! My favorite part in this book is when the monkeys get back at the Twits. I like this part of the story because I felt sorry for the monkeys having to stand on their heads all day. If I were in the monkeys' position I would have done the same thing! In this book there were some parts I didn't like. One part I didn't like was when Mrs. Twit put her glass eye in Mr. Twit's coffee cup and he almost drank it. The other part I didn't like was when Mr. Twit just lets his wife float away wanting to get rid of her anyway. <BR>Next I'll tell you what the Twits look like. Mr. Twit has a very long beard (he thinks it makes him look wise and handsome but really it makes him look ugly). In his beard are little bits of food from all different meals. Mr. Twit never takes a bath so he smells as bad as Swiss cheese! He wears a plum purple suit everyday. Mr. Twit is horrible at being nice and making friends, (which is probably why he doesn't have any friends). But Mr. Twit may be horrible and nasty but he's good at catching birds and making Mrs. Twit really mad!<BR>Now for Mrs. Twit, she used to be beautiful but then she had ugly thoughts and ugly thoughts make you look as ugly as your thoughts so that makes Mrs. Twit the ugliest person in the world! She's mean and nasty and she hits the monkeys with her cane if they don't do what Mr. Twit says.  Mrs. Twit is as bad at everything Mr. Twit is bad at (which is probably why they're husband and wife!), but Mrs. Twit is a great at cooking (especially worms and birds!).  <BR>I felt different about each character.  I didn't like Mr. Twit at all because he was really mean.  It shows that he was mean when he was going to put kids in his pie instead of birds.  I thought that was really cruel.  As for Mrs. Twit she was as bad as Mr. Twit was because she hit the monkeys.  The only characters I liked were the monkeys, the Muggle-Wumps because they always had hope that they would get free someday.  I liked the book because it was always making me laugh and it kept me reading so that I could find out what would happen next.  That's why I liked the story, The Twits, but you don't have to take my word for it, read the book and find out if you like it!
B00005R2M3|3.0|Shakira nos tiene acostrumbrados a letras sugerentes, pegajosas y con veradera inspiración. En este nuevo trabajo Shakira se luce desde una perspectiva general del album.<br />Las canciones de este disco se amoldan a la fórmula de Shakira del disco anterior, que vendio millones de copias. Esto me hace pensar que hubo cierta búsqueda de comercialidad en el proceso del disco. Esto le quita un poco de su personalidad artística, aunque no la esencia del proceso de composición de la obra como expresión de algo.<br />En el disco destacan tracks como: &quot;Underneath your clothes&quot; por su letra sugestiva, aunque me recuerda a &quot;Octavo día&quot; por su tipo de composición, sus pulsaciones de ritmo al final del track; sobresale &quot;Tango (Objection)&quot; por su excelente mezcla de sonidos rock con instrumentos aparentemente contrastantes como la guitarra y el acordeón, aunque me recuerda a &quot;Ciega Sordomuda&quot;, ambas usan un estilo -tango y mariachi- como formula; &quot;Rules&quot; es una excelente canción que expresa el compromiso de una relación con verdadero amor, tiene un exquisito sabor a rock de los 80`s; &quot;The One&quot; por su tinte setentoso y gran sentido de personalidad individual del amor es distinguida; y &quot;Te dejo Madrid&quot; tiene un original sabor innovador en su melodia inroductoria pero, me parece típica en ella la armónica que tambien suena en &quot;¿Dónde estan los ladrones?&quot;. A lo mejor esto es parte de la personalidad de Shakira, pero pareciera entonces que no evoluciona completamente por esas formulas que se mantienen. Esa repetición de elementos plàsticos en su composición causa cierta desilución.<br />Esta producción de la &quot;Mujer llena de gracia&quot; le garantiza un lugar dentro del mercado anglosajón que no la conoce. Tiene una gran expresidad artística pero, esto se ve opacado en la tipicidad de la fórmula en algunas canciones. El disco es muy bueno pero esto le hace perder parte de la esencia creadora de una obra artística. En general admiro a Shakira por que sobre los patrones del mercado, su obra si tiene personalidad, a pesar de todo.
630588255X|4.0|It's well known how wonderful this movie is.  Unlike crude schtick like, say, &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot;, &quot;Harold &amp; Maude&quot; really makes the viewer think, think about the labels we place on things, think about life, love, branching-out.  Very life-affirming.<BR>The DVD-edition contains little in the way of 'bells-and-whistles', with only 2 theatrical trailers for extras.  However, the picture is quite crisp and the sound, the sound is AMAZING.  If you're a fan, you'll truly appreciate how great this disk looks and sounds.  If you're not... WHY?!!
B00004TH83|4.0|Lara Fabian's voice is simply astounding - a mix of Celine Dion &amp; Barbra Streisand.  The songs on the CD are pretty good - they show off her voice well, but none of them really grabbed me.  I could listen to her sing almost anything though!  This CD is worth it just to listen to her warm &amp; lovely sound.
B00005R2M3|5.0|I have been a fan of Shakira for about 3 years now. She is just too amazing for words! An incredibily sweet and caring person who puts out unique and excellent music. Her fans have been waiting for years for this very album. She could have caved in to all the pressure an put out an english album a couple of years ago but being the &quot;perfectionist&quot; and &quot;control freak&quot; that she is...she wanted to wait until she was confident in her english skills. And here it is...&quot;Laundry Service.&quot;&quot;Laundry Service&quot; contains 13 songs...9 of which are in English. 1) Objection- excellent song with a fusion of tango and rock! Very unique! I love the rap part!!2) Underneath Your Clothes- great love song...some critics have said that this song is a little too sappy...well Shakira is truly in love now and love does that to people! Nice song and she shows us the power of her voice!3) Whenever,Wherever- first single off the album and I LOVE this song! Great use of real Peruvian instruments! Very danceable!4) Rules- catchy song that has great single potential! Great use of her voice also!5) The One- another great love song inspired by her fiance Antonio. Very catchy also! I can hear this one being a hit on the radio aleady. 6) Ready for the Good Times- Shakira shows us some variety here as she throws in a song with a 70s disco beat. Great song musically!!7) Fool- this song is destined for Top 10 greatness! Very easy to get this song stuck in your head. 8) Te Dejo Madrid- the first of the 4 spanish songs on the album. I LOVE this song! From the great guitar opening to the last wail this song rocks!! 9) Poem to a Horse- BEST SONG on the album in my opinion. Here you can see why Shakira is considered a genius! Excellent use of words and the music rocks!! If this is released as a single it will shoot to number 1!!! Like nothing on the music scene right now.10) Que Me Quedes Tu- another spanish song. Prett mellow song with nice music.11) Eyes Like Yours- thisis the only english translation from her previous hits in spanish. I love the translation and &quot;Ojos Asi&quot;, the song in spanish, is one of my favorite songs of all time. Great song that celebrates Shakira Lebanese heritage! Excellent Middle Eastern instruments!12) Suerte- spanish version of &quot;Whenever,Wherever&quot;. This has been a number 1 hit in Latin America for 9 weeks straight!13) Te Aviso, Te Anuncio- spanish version of &quot;Objection&quot;. I like this version better just because the rap part sounds better in spanish!Overall &quot;Laundry Service&quot; shows an evolved Shakira. As she says herself...she feels like a different person now that she is in love. Keep it up Shakira!!! YOU ROCK!!!!
B0000584V3|5.0|Man, what an incredible apex these guys have climbed.   First off, its clear from riff one that this is a team effort between Stephen Wilson (of Porcupine Tree) and Opeth. Wilson contributes vocals, guitars and keyboards, and you get the sense that he really got what this band has been trying to do in terms of the complete vision, and took it to a completely new level by accentuating the jarring textures and balancing it expertly.  The delicacy with which this album is produced cannot be overstated, and I can't even imagine how painful it must have been to produce this album.  Even if you absolutely hate death metal, its worth hearing once to hear how astoundingly fresh and vital it sounds, how smoothly its mixed, and how incredible the textures are used to help aid the jarring contrasts in the songs themselves.  I can only conjecture Wilson also contributed the tiniest bit of pop sensibility by reducing the almost untenable average length of at least some of the songs, allowing the themes to be more concisely executed from song to song.<br />Great guitar and vocal tones abound, but my favorites have to be the amazing, almost folky vibe and uplifting vocal harmonies around &quot;Harvest&quot;, and the wall of ascending metal riffage on &quot;The Drapery Falls&quot; is beautiful to behold.  On the darker side, the absolutely unearthly screeching by Mikael Akkerfelt on &quot;The Funeral Portrait&quot; is terrifyingly appropriate.<br />Being a veteran of _Morningrise_ I know Opeth has some pretty serious chops, but their virtuosity is expressed more by the composition and construction of their songs rather than finger and time signature exercises.  Its the equivalent of a metal  Beethoven concerto, and though admittedly the dark metal stylings are an acquired taste, the compositional skill and just the manner with which the contrasting pastoral and deathly styles are integrated are riveting and genre-defying.  In that respect I believe it succeeds in ways that even Amorphis' classic _Elegy_ could not, because the underlying music is better.  Only time will tell truly whether or not Opeth has delivered a true-blue genre-defining classic, but I suspect very strongly they have.
B00001SIES|5.0|This is one of the most powerful debut albums I've ever heard.This trio can certainly create a noise as loud as Nirvana.Brilliant guitar work-the most amazing vocalist you're likely to hear-Thom Torke meets Jeff Buckley-he can reach the highest notes and also the lowest ones also.His voice is full of angst and it is one f the most amazing things on this c.d.Some of the songs are amazing-especially Sunburn-when it starts and ends with beautiful piano-Cave and Uno are great songs too.And this album is way better then their most recent one.I just can't wait for this band to release a live album-cos they are simply awesome live.
B00005R2M3|5.0|Shakira's new album is wonderful. First of all, she has a beautiful and amazing voice. Second: she is a excellent writter and the most important thing: She fells music. If you want a good album buy her new one: Laundry Service!
0804106304|5.0|Listening to the compilation of the best songs of your favorite artist is just like reading this magnificent book - infatuating,<BR>stimulating and fascinating.The Joy Luck Club is a compilation of 16 beautifully titled chapters about the stories of 4 mothers and 4 daughters.Shadows from the past of those mothers were revealed when they observed the contemporary lifestyle of their American-born daughters.The reminiscence of their history in China will make you tend to your seat and listen to what Amy Tan has to say in this book from the beginning until the end.<br />Tan has made mother and daughter her own subject in this wonderful book and it works magically through an important aspect- love.<BR>This book will inspire you with intense fondness.The story has stayed in my mind for a long time - like air and dust- inseparable.This is the first novel by Amy Tan,the best of hers and the most unforgettable novel I've ever read.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Britney is back and better than ever! I could say stuff like she &quot;did it again&quot; or &quot;one more time&quot; but thats kinda getting old now. When you forget about her sexy image and the bad rap she constantly receives, this is just straight up fun music! There are so many people in this world who can't deal with their own insecurities so they choose to Britney-bash. Everyone I've talked to has seemed to like this CD. Even people I know who don't really approve of Brintey's sexy image have admitted to me that they can't resist this album. Britney shows major growth with this album and co-wrote many of the tracks, so that is one less thing people can criticize her for. I think people need to realize that Britney isn't here to degrade women or destroy music. On the contrary, she is making great music that is heating up the clubs and I believe she is a great role model! She just happens to be really hot too, you can't blame her for that!
B00005OAIE|5.0|Before I actually heard more than one of his songs, I heard he was a combination of Dave Matthews(the best artist ever to walk the face of the earth), Sting, and Jaboc Dylan.  Well, I like all of these artists, so I figured I'd give John Mayer a chance.  I LOVE HIM!!  If you like Dave Matthews like I do, you'll love John Mayer, they sound soo much alike.  But I think you should seriously give John Mayer a chance, I promise you'll like it!!!
B00005O3VC|5.0|I'll not talk about the film itself, because there's plenty of people to tell you how original and funny it is.  No, the greatness of this is the DVD.  The print of the film is bright and sharp (unlike on the old VHS versions), and all the extras really make this well worth the cost.  The documentary with Michael Palin and Terry Jones retracing their film locations is wonderful, as are the many commentaries, and of course, the &quot;subtitles for people who don't like the film.&quot;  If you're a Monty Python fan, you own a DVD player, and you DON'T have this DVD, it's an outright sin.  Even if you have the old DVD, burn it and buy this one.  This is a prime example of why DVD is so much better than VHS.
B00005JKHP|5.0|And it really has been fixed to where fans who despised this first entry in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; movies can now relate to it more! Director Robert Wise made a smart move when he brought back most of the deleted scenes into his final format which make it more easy to understand, and keep the plot moving at very good pace. However, with other scenes he did delete, and did not use in the final version, he is able to let us see them on the dual disc DVD set! Along with the new scenes comes new CGI scenes which make the scenes more easier to understand. As the Enterprise goes further into the V'Ger ship, you'll know what I mean! As the new scenes have been added in, it also gives more heart to the chracters of Kirk and Spock, and we understand more of Spock's personal quest for fullfillment with each of the new scenes. Finally, I also love the remastered music and digital score. It made me cry when you heared sound effects like the beaming effect from the original series played in this film. Look for a promotion of the new &quot;Star Trek&quot; series &quot;Enterprise&quot; on this DVD. Thank you Robert Wise and Paramount for the care you put back into it.
B00005QK3W|5.0|I'm not going to get into a critique of each song on this CD. Suffice to say that I needed four times around the block with this one to &quot;get it.&quot; Having purchased every McCartney solo LP since &quot;McCartney&quot; on the day of release, I came to this one with the usually excitement to hear from an old friend. The Macca fans (from various newsgroups) who rode &quot;Driving Rain&quot; around the block one time and proclaimed it not up to par with other Paul releases, are simply not giving it the proper test drive. &quot;Driving Rain&quot; needs the listener to &quot;go there and back again and again.&quot; Then you'll understand that It falls nicely into place with as one of his best. My favorites -- &quot;She's Giving Up Talking,&quot; &quot;Driving Rain&quot;, &quot;Heather&quot;, &quot;From A Lover To A Friend&quot;, &quot;Back in the Sunshine Again,&quot; and &quot;Magic.&quot; The rocking 10-minute closer &quot;Rinse the Raindrops&quot; is very White Album-worthy in a &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; way. All in all ... full of &quot;runcible&quot; tunes. Thanks Sir Paul!
B00003CXSP|1.0|This is an incredibly vile, unbelievably stupid film, such that even needing to go into details would be an utter waste of time.  I'm not sure how low of an IQ one would need to actually enjoy this tripe, but suffice it to say that even my teddy bear, who watched it with me to comfort me through the &quot;scary&quot; parts, was sneering in disgust for two weeks afterward.  And on that note, even the gore factor was a joke compared to its hype...the film's gore imagery was so ridiculous and over the top that it was far more comedic than frightening.<br />No comparison with Silence of the Lambs (or any other film for that matter), no hand-wringing over the film's ridiculous gore, and no regret over any likeness or lack of likeness to the book, is necessary to judge this moronic waste of celluloid as anything but a mind-numbing insult to intelligence.  It's clear now why the film burned through its 15 minutes of hype so quickly, and on a related aside, I hope Ridley Scott is enjoying his post-Gladiator 15 minutes while he has them...they won't be lasting much longer.<br />My sincere hats off to Jodie Foster for her show of integrity, whatever it was worth, in not having been dragged into being a part of this sorry mess...I've never respected her more.  And if ever I ask myself what made me lose what used to be a healthy amount of respect for both Anthony Hopkins and Julianne Moore, there is no doubt at all where I'll point.  This is the most insultingly stupid and plainly awful film that Hollywood has churned out in several years, and a complete embarrassment to some noteworthy, talented actors that may be laughing to the bank, but who have destroyed a large part of the professional credibility they once enjoyed with intelligent movie-goers.<br />Anyone claiming that this film is &quot;brilliant&quot; should have their right to use that word revoked permanently.  And stay away from complex machinery.
0375703764|4.0|I'm not sure I can organize my thoughts coherently about this book, it seems to discourage rational thought.  I do think some of the reviewers are missing the point on all the extra material.  It isn't there in an attempt to appear scholarly or pompous or impressive.  I saw the footnotes, appendices and lists as a tongue-in-cheek poke at real-life scholarly works with their excessive references.  I quickly figured out which footnotes were important and which ones were &quot;fluff&quot;.<br />Zampano's constant digressions and discussions about mythology, etymology and psychology were interesting and easily skimmed if necessary.  They did break up the flow of the narrative but I think they added to the substance of the book and they didn't interrupt the creep factor for me.<br />Johnny's footnoted story was funny, sexy, entertaining and equally creepy in parts.  Some of his &quot;hallucinations&quot; raised the hairs on the back of my neck.  Maybe I shouldn't have read most of the book in the post-midnight hours.  The letters from his institutionalized mother were equally eerie and I think readers should attempt to get an edition with them included. (I think that's the &quot;Whalestoe Letters&quot; section)<br />In addition to the entertainment value of the book, there is the sense of accomplishment at reading it.  The trade paperback is a weighty tome, and when you show your friends and family the size, footnotes and sometimes bizarre typesetting, they will be impressed.  The only caveat and the reason it doesn't get five stars is that the book can be imposing at first and I had some difficulty getting started.  Then the momentum hit me and I was carried away into the House.
B00003CX5P|4.0|Consider George Lucas's $4 million investment in bringing the Phantom Menace to DVD an apology for the oft-maligned Episode I, and you'll feel good about adding the double-disc to your collection. <BR>Disc one features a sparkling THX transfer of the film, or one should say &quot;data&quot;, since so much of it was generated digitally anyway. Several scenes have been tweaked or extended, in true Lucas fashion, but Jar-Jar remains annoyingly intact.  The audio tracks astound with perfect Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround EX, and English and Spanish Dolby 2.0 tracks. Track four contains film commentary by George Lucas, producer Rick McCallum, Ben Burtt, Rob Coleman, John Knoll, Dennis Muren and Scott Squires. Burtt, Coleman, Knoll and Muren are most impressive, with Lucas and McCallum not really saying anything new. <BR>Disc two provides a rare glimpse behind the scenes at Lucasfilm with hours and hours of footage, stills, deleted scenes and trailers. One caution for sensitive viewers of disc two is the fondness that Episode I producer Rick McCallum apparently has for the F word- all clipped of course to just &quot;f..&quot; - but most are obvious.  Included in the hour-long documentary &quot;The Beginning&quot; is a hint that several at Lucasfilm, including Lucas himself, may have had an early indication that the Phantom Menace was falling short of expectations by attempting to do too much, but strived to improve the picture right up until its theatrical release in May 1999.<br />Thanks again, George. We'll be watching...
B00005R2M3|5.0|Shakira is and has been the most talented latin artist today. And now in english she is and will be the most talented artist in the World. Not only does she write her great songs, but she also has a voice to die for. Go and buy all of her cds, she just doen't have a bad song in any of them, and this one is NO EXCEPTION. This 24 year old is pure raw unstoppable talent.
0061091480|5.0|I found this book to not only be exceptionally helpful and on point ... but also very well laid out.<br />Each chapter starts with Wayne presenting his information, followed by clear examples and bullet points that serve to drive home his topics.<br />I also have listened to his tapes and he has a refereshingly different presentation - not your typical motivational shouter or joke teller.<br />This is a great first Dyer book to purchase! Highly recommended.
B00003CXZ1|2.0|In short, it's a watchable movie, but it only gets two stars because I wouldn't buy it.<br />As far as the movie itself, ummm... what's going on again? Triangle pieces, time-control, boulder monsters, pet robots, etc... I felt like I was watching Wild Wild West again (oh, the horror!!!)<br />I liked Jolie's barbie-exaggerated proportions, but not necessarily the Lara Croft character. What could be mistaken for strong will and independence in &quot;Lady&quot; Lara Croft, I found more to be attitude smug, physically inhuman, and emotionally unreachable; except for the one large crack in her padded armor - that &quot;mysterious&quot; death of her father (the Father will be with you... always) Funny thing about this movie is you rarely see the lighting directly on Jolie's face - instead focus is shifted to other areas as evidenced by the cover of the box). Prepubescent teenagers should get a thrill but I'll stick with Raiders of the Lost Ark.
B00000JMOF|5.0|The definitive version. This has never been bettered, no matter how much revisionists like Kenneth Branagh claim to be going back to the original story. Mary Shelley's book is mainly one of atmosphere, and this atmosphere is captured perfectly here, with Frankenstein's mood from optimism, to horror, to desperation, and finally resignation reflected in the haunted features of Colin Clive. That the following films in the series concentrated on the monster and on Karloff was largely due to the public's overwhelmingly positive reaction to Karloff's portrayal, but the star of this first film is Colin Clive. That is not to denigrate Karloff's performance, which is at times sensitive, menacing, and child-like. The Creature's experiences take him along the same path of emotions as experienced by Frankenstein himself, from optimism to resignation, and to convey those emotions under so much make-up is testament to Karloff's acting skills. The sets are beautiful, from the silhouetted hilltop scenes, ancient castles, and of course the laboratory. The lab set was designed so beautifully for black and white (as the lovingly made spoof version in Young Frankenstein evidences) and is every young boy's dream chemistry set and electrical lab. The lack of music seems unusual these days, but it was still only a few years after the first talkies and incidental music has not established itself. I find it quite refreshing not to have sentimental music during the scene with the little girl, nor dramatic horns and strings during the final scenes. The DVD has an expert's commentary which is well-informed, but rather blandly read. Nevertheless the DVD is re-mastered well with a clear print highlighting the excellent contrasts achieved by clever set design and lighting. An essential part of any movie buff's collection.
6303433766|5.0|It's hard to believe this film is in the least based on fact! Kate Winslet gives an intense, and believable performace in this strange film.  In case you don't know, this is the true story of two girls, Juliet Hume (Kate Winslet) and another young lady, who engage in a rather, to say the least, strange relationship. They create a rather complex fantasy world, which in their dreams and minds they begin to inhabit. Becoming drunk by this world, they lose all sense of reality, and become hopelessly inseperable.   There parents, of course, begin to notice this growing obsession, and take measures to seperate them, which they counteract, through horrificly destructive measures, forever altering their young lives forevermore!   Winslet gives a covincing, and sometimes terrifying, performace, spuring her to eventual worldwide fame!   You simply must buy this film if you enjoy Kate's work!
0800139151|5.0|Take a good old-fashioned Western with plenty of action and throw in Sharon Stone as the lead character and you have an electrifying adventure<br />I enjoyed every minute of it<br />Stone plays the role of a female gunslinger with an incredible combination of toughness and feminine sensuality<br />Gene Hackmann plays the thoroughly evil town tyrant John Herod  (nice touch -him sharing the name of the biblical tyrant king)<br />Russle Crowe plays a pacifist preacher -who was once a feared and ruthless gunman- has foresworn<br />Violence<br />Leonardo De Caprio plays the brash over-confidant youth who will come to a tragic end<br />But there are many actors in this movie playing cameo roles who also show great flair<br />I was gripped throughout
B00005LMBK|2.0|I think that Gorillaz is more for fans of animation than fans of music. I fell in love with that little line that shows up on Murdoc's butt as he's thrusting himself around on the &quot;Rock the House&quot; video, but just listening to the CD was disappointing. Am I the only one who thinks that the music doesn't live up to the visuals?
B00005QIPH|5.0|The Strokes have the potential to save music.<BR>If people will listen.<BR>Is This It is one of the few albums released this year worth listening to.  All year I found myself looking for something worth buying in a sea of manufactured pop and hip-hop, and I found very few albums I would put my money on.  Is This It has a musical flare that only a few albums this year boasted- Pete Yorn's musicforthemorningafter, for example.  The Strokes are a band that can boast being a band in 2001, unlike some other undeserved rock &quot;heroes.&quot;  We compare The Strokes to Radiohead because people say Radiohead can save music.  (Radiohead can't save music.  They had the potential to with OK Computer, but then Kid A came out and they've been continuing down this road of total and utter lack of musical talent that has retrogressed into wannabe-techno noise.)<br />The Strokes can put their money where their mouths are.  They have the music, the talent, the lyrics, the singer, the musicians.  It's all there and all very real, and when you listen to this fine work of music, you settle back into this confused little world of youth.  (How wonderful is that?  While Radiohead spits out &quot;profound lyrics&quot; like &quot;this morning i woke up sucking a lemon,&quot; which is really about as profound as &quot;hit me baby one more time&quot;, the strokes sing: &quot;i like it right here but i cannot stay&quot; and &quot;tomorrow it is different, and this is why i'm leaving&quot;)  OK, so the Strokes aren't musical geniuses that will alter the face of music forever.  But were the rock bands of the 70's geniuses?  They sang of everything the Strokes do, no less profoundly, no less simply.  But it doesn't matter.  It's not all about the lyrics, it's more about the music.<BR>The Strokes are great because they have it all.<BR>They just need someone to listen.<br />So go out and listen.
B00005R2M3|5.0|What I like most about Shakira is that besides being a great singer she is a great musician. Her latest album proves it...
B00000DHTF|1.0|No wonder most of this material was unreleased!! The songs sound all the same !! Absolutely nothing new, only Springsteen's old formula, but without the charm that is present in the material that went on to their final cuts in his discography !!! Keep away !!!
0684171600|5.0|This expertly written adventure tale is still as amusing and &quot;page-turning&quot; for the adult reader as it was when it was first made required reading in junior high school.  Also makes a great book to be read aloud to youngsters...  Harry Potter has wizards, Jack Hawkins has pirates!  This edition is particularly desirable with the breathtaking illustrations by NC Wyeth.
6305263248|4.0|That's why I bought it.  The story is ok.  It's mostly believable and fairly entertaining if you don't think about it too much.  But the car chases are the best thing about it.  In most car chases they drive slow and use tricks to make it seem more dramatic, or everything is so well choreographed that it's just unbelievable.  But in Ronin they did it right.  They drove real cars at real speeds on real roads (narrow ones at that), and half the time you are certain they are going to wreck.  I don't know who the drivers were, but they deserve every cent they were paid.
B00005R2M3|4.0|First, let me start by saying that I have listened to Shakira since Pies Descalzos came out in 1996.  I absolutely love Shakira.  I do like this CD; it will probably be in my car discman for some time to come.  The main drawback I see with this album is what I feared; her accent is just so strong it makes her incredibly hard to understand.  The lyrics and music are great.  But when she tries to sing slowly, it just comes out sounding more like mush at times.  This is where I think Enrique Iglesias did a better job of choosing an English album with fast-paced songs.  I think he realized his accent was still too strong to support his ballads.  <br />When Shakira sings the faster songs, she's great and the mis-pronounciations can be forgiven.  With the slower songs, it's hit and miss though.  And of course, the Spanish songs are pure joy.  Te Dejo Madrid is AWESOME!  That song, Suerte, and Objection are reason enough to buy the cd.  And the rest of the songs are strong enough to make it a must buy.  In the future, I hope Shakira either stick to faster songs or work on that accent (don't lose it, just become more understandable).

B00000099Y|5.0|This CD is probably one of the best I've ever heard.  I've heard CDs (Like Nirvana's In Utero) with more varied and accessible songs, perhaps, but not where the entire Album acts as one.<br />Well, that's not entirely true...Aenema, the title yet not-title track (look at the title of the song and the title of the CD...they do indeed differ) takes a step outsde the rest of the Cd for a powerful, straightforward, and outright critique (backed by thrashing instrumentals one would expect from Undertow)of not just Los Angelos or California, but the entire American culture, as Maynard sings &quot;I sure could use a vacation from this bullsh** three-ring circus sideshow of freaks.&quot;  No one is safe in this entourage of fingerpointing...frivolous lawsuits and those who file them, false leaders and those who follow them, self-absorbed celebrities, dishonest politicians...in the end, Maynard tells all of us, one way or another, to learn to swim.<br />But Aenema is far from being representative from the rest of the album.  It is, in fact, quite the opposite.  Though Eulogy and Hooker With a Penis approach the psychological intensity in Aenema.  In fact, everything on this album, including the so-called &quot;filler tracks&quot; like Useful Idiot have a deeper meaning.  Aenima is more about opening one's mind, of thinking for one's self, of taking a new perspective on life....to use Maynard's own words, of &quot;prying open my third eye.&quot;  <br />And this is where you separate the fans from those who like it because it's metal.  Tool doesn't pretend to be the be all and end all.  If you take a minute to listen to the climactic message in Aenema, &quot;try and read between the lines,&quot; you realize that Tool is simply trying to be a catalyst...something Maynard himself said on their most recent tour.  If you read, for instance, the long passage in the liner notes, you find the final sentences, &quot;Beliefs are dangerous.  Beliefs allow the mind to stop functioning.A non-functioning mind is clinically dead.  Believe nothing...&quot;  Or perhaps you notice the genetic and Jungian allusions in Forty-Six &amp; 2.  Or the Bill Hicks tribute in Third Eye and Aenema (or in the liner notes for that matter).  Or the odd German lyrics to De Eir von Satan.  Tool doesn't ask you to take what they say at face value.  They ask you to question it...to find out what they're really saying...to expand your own knowledge and your won perspective.<br />And then they ask yo to take that experience you have created for yourself that has only been catalyzed by their music (not created, as you always had that inside yourself) and use it to make the world a better place.  THAT is what Tool is about, not unleashed anger, not swearing, not scary videos.<br />Musically, they excel as well.  True, some of the parts aren't as unleashed as one could expect from some other bands, but one must realize that Tool isn't about cool guitar riffs.  It's about art.

B000000W5H|3.0|Hey the title sums it all up. This album will take alittle while for the listener to get used to, but that is because the Stones started to change their sound from the BEGGARS BANQUET to EXILE ON MAIN ST. days. This album has an excellent cover of AINT TO PROUD TO BEG which does justice to the original. The title track is a song that will forever be a mandatory classic rock staple. IF YOU CANT ROCK ME is a good down and dirty rockin song that helpes to kick the album off. TIL THE NEXT GOODBYE is a good heart-felt ballad that shows  Mick's vocal talents. TIME WAITS FOR NO ONE has a funky, jazzy sound to it that actually is a diamond in the rough off this album. DANCE LITTLE SISTER is a good rockin song that will get you dancing and is another good song that hasnt really been given its due. I gave this album 3 stars, but it is actually closer to 3 1/2 and I think any rock fan will enjoy this
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Here is the latest in the battle of the CG animation giants, PDI (Dreamworks), and Pixar (Disney).  &quot;Shrek&quot; is a Joe Frazier left hook, for sure - this DVD has the works: great plot, fine animation, excellent music (the number that ends the film is simply terrific), and loads of extra features.  Productions such as this one are tailor-made for the Digital Theater System sound and the widescreen format - no doubt about it.<br />Now to see what Disney's response is with &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot;...they have their work cut out for them in trying to equal &quot;Shrek&quot;.  I just feel bad about not going to see this film when it was in theatrical release...
B000003BF1|5.0|LET IT BLEED is another in a line of classic albums from the Rolling Stones, and this is a must have for any rock music fan. The albums starts off with the eerie sounds of GIMME SHELTER, which happens to be my favorite Stones song of all time. LOVE IN VAIN is an old Robert Johnson blues song that the Stones cover and make there own. COUNTRY HONK, is a two-steepin version of HONKEY TONK WOMEN that the Stones pull off quite well. Every song on this album is a bona fide hit,but probably the song that really shows the Stones at their best is YOU CANT ALWAYS GET WHAT YOU WANT. This album has it all: rock, blues and country that in later albums the Stones would merge together to make them the Greatest Rock n Roll Band in the world. Dont forget to listen to MIDNIGHT RAMBLER which comes off as a companion piece to SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL, and MONKEY MAN which is a classic song that the Stones have taken to playing in concert once again. If all these young pop bands want to know what real music is, this is a good album for them to start with.
B00003CXZ1|2.0|Ah yes, Angelina Jolie...well, this film did not do much for me -in spite of her presence.  The effects and action were okay, but the characters were paper-thin, the plot was murky (if you could call it a plot at all), and the overall of the film was uninspiring.  One gets the feeling that any one of several so-called action stars could have substituted for Ms. Jolie (and I don't think much of any of them, either).  Angelina does have some pretty good acting chops (&quot;Girl Interrupted&quot;, for example), but hardly showcases them here...
B000003BEM|5.0|BEGGARS BANQUET is a true classic that many people say is the first of a string of classic landmark albums, and I cant say I disagree. The album starts off with SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL, which will forever stand out as one of the greatest, if not the greatest rock epic of all time. Its sinister sound and dark lyrics slapped all the flower child dead in their faces. NO EXPECTATIONS, and DEAR DOCTOR are the next two songs that prepare us for what is to come, a mixture of country and rock on most of the album that the Stones pull off greatly. STREET FIGHTING MAN is an angry political song that describes what the world would see happening in the streets of Chicago in '68. PRODIGAL SON is a foot stomping country song that is also a great one. STRAY CAT BLUES shows the Stones first true influence, it has a bluesy sound to it. Song for song this is a great album and it is a true rock classic. Lets drink to the SALT OF THE EARTH
0618150714|5.0|This is one of the most delightful children's books ever. I listened to my mom (Ann)read the Paddington books to my younger brother and was hooked. When I was younger, I remember my mom telling me about the bear on tv who liked marmalade but was never interested in him until I heard the stories. The stories often ended in tears- we would laugh so much. Well, I guess this is less of a review than it is a recommendation. With all of the worthless children's literature out there, this one stands out.
B000000W5B|4.0|After recording four classic albums in a row, I think that most critics and fans were way to harsh on GOATS HEAD SOUP. I has taken me a few times of listening to it to finally come to appreciate it.  ANGIE, and HEARTBREAKER, are the two hits off this album that are the most familiar to the public, but the listener shouldn't stop there. COMING DOWN AGAIN, is a Keith vocal that is filled with intensity and has that Keith raspy voice. DANCING WITH MR D., has a dark sound to it that is actuall a good song on its on. 100 YEARS AGO has a good piano play to it. SILVER TRAIN is a good rockin song that the listener might just find themselves dancing to. The same goes to HIDE YOUR LOVE. I say that be fair to this album and give it a listen. It has good songs, not everyone great on the last 4 albums, but that doesnt make it any less of a great record. Dont forget to give STAR STAR a listen, you will be in for a surprise.
B0000584V3|5.0|By far the album of the year.I can't stop listening to it the combination and the way they wrote those songs is awsome!!!!
B00005R2M3|5.0|Shakira produced her own cd, which is very brave taken for a fact that this is her first english language album, other artists would've had some &quot;real&quot; producer do the honors, but not Shakira, she did it on her own and that's what makes this cd shine.<BR>An album (for us who know her latin albums) that shows a mature artist with the same intelligence on writing, chossing each word to make sense and transmit a message, read the lyrics and you would see a statement beyond a latin beat, a clear percussion or a high vocal note. Her music continues to be entertaining, her lyrics easy to listen to, and her voice... What else needs to be said, and intrument on it's own!<BR>From &quot;Tango&quot; a very upbeat song, mixing classic argentinian style with modern pop, to the single &quot;Whenever, wherever (suerte)&quot; with it's andean intrumentation and catchy pop flare, to &quot;Rules&quot; (to me the best track on the cd) a song with retro pop sounds, and the coolest vocal arrengement, and &quot;Underneath your clothes&quot; the heavy acustic slow song, makes in all interesting to listen. In a world where pop and rock are so copied with no personal style, this woman shines, it steps on her own ground, letting us see (what us her latin fans already knew) what she's really capable of doing. Give it  a try, get the hook from it, and enjoy even the accent that makes it unique (what makes it a real crossover) and discover a sensation of sounds, let it take you to wherever you wanna go! La hiciste grande Shakira!
B00004SU5J|5.0|Too rich for daily consumption- save it for special occaisions.
B00005OM4N|4.0|I absolutely love \\"Slave for U\\"; that high energy sound is so sexy in it. Some (not all), of the songs on this CD show definate growth in the star. Of course, having excellent songwriters and producers doesn't hurt. I love \\"Anticipating\\". It's SO 70's. And \\"Slave for you\\" gives me the feeling she ain't nobody's slave, which is what I love about it.  This is the type of CD to throw in when one needs to feel energy. It's very empowering in the lyrics, no whining over men here but all exude a woman that knows what she wants, where she is going and phooey on you if you don't like it, eat my dust.  These songs are written from a strong, female perspective, not a Whitney Houston \\"I can't live without my lover\\" view.  This is a fun CD, not heavy, not meant to impress w/vocal leaps and bounds, just an innocent kind of pop, with, I dare say, a few hints of the 70's era every now and then in the mixing... ENJOY! And, hey-not EVERYTHING has to be deep right?  And Britney Spears' platfrom is NOT social justice...The songs are catchy, danceable, and sweet.  Believe me, I'm a harsh critic of music-but music for fun, just for the sake of fun-come one guys, give her a break.  After all, I'm a Sarah Brightman/Andrea Bocelli fan, and Britney Spears is in the CD changer right along with them!
0380973650|4.0|Remember how ornery the Norse, Greek or African Gods are in mythology?  How petty?  How vengeful and selfish?  Neil Gaiman portrays them just that way, and the comparisons to America's new &quot;Gods&quot; (and American folk in general) are very insightful and pretty amusing.<br />Neil Gaiman is a storytelling genius when working in comics.  In Sandman, he was able to sum up eons of myth or contradition in the span of one or two panels of a comic page.  In the print medium, the pace is a little slower.  The digressions that made his comics work so thoughtful and enjoyable are a little more frustrating here.  Plus, there are numerous sub-plots involved.  The fact that everything gets cleared up at the end is satisfying and if there's a few &quot;deus ex machinas&quot; along the way, well what'd you expect?  It's about Gods after all.<br />If you've ever felt like the desires of &quot;American culture&quot; are at odds with people's spiritual needs, you should enjoy this book.  I think that's what Gaiman's getting at here, and the answers aren't nearly as highfalutin' as one would think.  They're discomforting -- sometimes mundane, sometimes horrifying -- in short, the way &quot;Old World&quot; Religions probably actually were when they were still taken as literal truth.
B00004Z459|2.0|Don Gillmore is the brain behind this group, having produced  many albums for great and not so great groups, this guy has a lot of creativity and a great vision. Do you really think that the guys at Linkin Park create their own songs, music or style???, let's face it, this group is a perfect &quot;creation&quot; for the new teenagers for the NU-Rock (NU rock???, and I tought grunge was a stupid name...) generation. Mixing HIP-HOP, rap, metal and the angry style of start-stop grunge music (for those too young search the word &quot;Nirvana&quot;, &quot;Pixies&quot; please) Linkin Park stands as the most commercial and succesful groups today, maybe just behind Fred Durst and Korn. I don't know why it's called &quot;alternative&quot; music, I mean, this is played everywhere so I assume it must be &quot;POP&quot;... Anyway Linking park is a no brain buy CD, if you are a teen  below 21 that's it, the music it's catchy (well, only the song &quot;In the end, the rest I will let you be the judge), it's well played, sometimes overproduced, it's angry, but what really hurts the band is the age of these guys. WHY??? well maybe because they are too good for their own good, while many guys take several years at dad's garage just to play some covers, Linkin park are experts (COME ON!!!). The Rap sections are sub-stardard, when Chester try to shout in pain he just can't deliver the same male-goat-in-agony sound that Cobain delivered, sounds like he's still changing his voice... <BR>I can't say it's a bad band, but they are not great either, maybe time will tell, but for now they are like N'Sync gone metal for teen-males, not original and uninspired, product of a older mind who can manipulate teen groups just for money and fame. Avoid this CD if you are looking for real &quot;alternative music&quot; (because this is too mainstream for me...) and your age surpasses 23. I could give these guys 3 stars but then again, they are trying to pull my leg...
B00005LOUS|5.0|I Loved this movie.It was Jim Carrey at his best. Great fun.<BR>See it very soon!

B000000WA4|5.0|this is the pumpkins at their best. <br />this album is filled to the rim with amazing guitar riffs, and brilliant lyrics. I recommend that everyone in the whole world buy this album.
0767903854|4.0|I have been to Austrilia and I thought this book gave a great desciption of the country itself and the people in it. I highly recommend this book to anybody curious, or traveling to Austrilia. My whole family laughed when I read them the description of the Sydney Museum, and other interesting stories Bill writes about. This book was fun and informational.
6305892806|5.0|Ever since I first placed the video in my VCR, I have been attached completely. Fanny Price is a beautiful and rich character, a humble girl who many women can relate to. The music is beutiful, while the cinamentograhpy was absolutly supurb. No, it does not follow the same exact story line of Jane Austen's amazing Mansfiled Park, yet is a great companion with 1996's Emma!
B00005Q66T|4.0|I am a huge madonna fan. I own all of her albums and basically every song she's ever made. So this collection really did not offer anything new for me. <BR>The songs are great. deeper and deeper being a highlight. The songs released form ray of light are also excellent. though the most noticable is songs such as erotica and human nature which portrayed a more contraversial side of madonna. Basicallyt this is a must have for any fan of madonna's more newer music. It is a non stop listen and does not disappoint. There is no new songs or remixes and this was truly disappointing, but this is still worth buying.
B000002MFQ|5.0|This CD is a must when we go on long trips.  We love all of it.  Such a variety!  Lots of pressure at work and home, somehow this CD helps out so much.  I'm anxious to receive Tubular Bells 1 and 3.  What a Holiday gift for my emotionally tired husband.  Especially great when volume is really at it's fullest!
B00005NI5Y|5.0|You never know where Dylan is going to take you to next, but even so, this CD was an unexpected journey. Although some of the songs, such as High Water, Tweedle Dee &amp; Tweedle Dum and Sugar Baby,  have a darkness similar to Time Out of Mind, rays of hope shine through. He guides you around the stumbling blocks, away from the rocks and hard places and shows you how to pick yourself up,dust yourself off and go on with life in an often brutal world. Musically, it flows about as gently as a white water raft, one moment soothing but turbulent the next. There is nothing like it. Way to go, Bob, you've raised the bar again.
B000002N2P|5.0|Everyone seems to have overlooked this album. Critics totally trashed it but it is Green Day at their punkiest. A much more dissonant album than Dookie...you can tell from the amazing album art. The lyrics are much more clever than on Dookie and each song is very different...unlike Dookie. My favorite Green Day songs are on Insomniac such as Brainstew, Jaded, and Walking Contradiction. It feels much rawer and more unfriendly than Dookie or Nimrod, which is a nice change. In short, buy this album if you like Green Day or this genre of music...especially if you have some of their other album. When you get sick of one, you put on the other. That seems to be the best way to do it(which is why I don't have any Green Day favorites).
0385505833|5.0|I have just finished SKIPPING CHRISTMAS, and I HIGHLY reccomend it to all.<br />(There aren't many of us here who haven't secretly, deep down wanted to do the very thing that Luther plans to do. But of course, halfway through the book, Grisham throws a classic monkey wrench into the whole thing.)<br /> With all the money you'll most likely spend this year at Christmas, buying this story either at the store or here, through Amazon is MORE then worth the money AND the few hours it will take to read.<br />What a classic idea! My hat is off to Grisham for breaking his<br />&quot;mold&quot; of legal thrillers and taking the time to write this.<br />It's funny,(Everyone will find SOMEthing in here they can relate to.) it's got heartwarming characters, and if you don't get teary eyed at the end then something's wrong.<br />This will make a GREAT movie. Well, don't sit there and continue reading these reviews.....Go get it!!!
6305903182|5.0|This is the best scream because it is powerful, twisted and finally brings Sydney to peace. Sydney lives out in the woods, with high security and has a new identity so the killer can't find her. But somehow, the killer gets hold of her. Meanwhile, Cotton and his girlfriend are murdered and Gale(by the way, she is a lot better nowadays) and Dewey are on the case. Also, Cotton was filming a part in Stab 3, a movie within the movie, and castmembers are winding up dead. When Gale tries to find out more about Sydney's mom, she finds nothing about it. Then Dewey realizes she might've been an actress. When the 3 reunite, Randy, now dead (he broke the rule and lost his virginity), has left a video tape on how to successfully survive a horror movie. 1. The killer will be almost impossible to die 2. The past will haunt you. 3. Something you never knew about will come back, possibly telling what really happened to Syd's mom. Last, any one of the main characters can die, including Syd. When Stab 3 gets canceled, the cast celebrates at the producer's house, where the truth comes out. I've already given away enough, so let's just leave it at that. It's the best because it offers Syd complete resolution, not only from killers but also the real story of her mom. <BR>The acting is brilliant and it features cameos from Jamie Kenndey, Liev Shriver, Heather Motzarro, Jenny McCarthy, and that really annoying flute teacher from Music of the Heart.
006016848X|5.0|This book gives an excellent description of female-male (mis-)communication patterns. I found numerous sample dialogues that seemed like word-by-word recordings from my own past. I feel that knowing (and acting upon) the interpretations and suggestions provided, some of the problems leading to my recent disengagement could have been resolved. This is a &quot;MUST READ&quot; for all couples committed to make their relationship succeed.
B00003CXZ4|1.0|Where am I? And why am I watching this movie? What happened in this scene? And what happened in that scene? If not being able to follow what happens to the narrator qualifies as unique moviemaking, then it is one of a kind. But that doesn't mean its great. I walked out in the middle. And I never looked back.
B00005BI94|5.0|I saw this movie in film school, and loved the mix of romantic comedy and suspense. While not the most memorable Hitchcock movie in terms of cinematography, plot, or acting, taken as a whole I think it's one of his most charming and funny movies.<br />The young Robert Donat is fantastic as the accidental spychaser: as smooth and handsome as Cary Grant would be. Madeleine Carroll is fine, but lacks the appeal of other Hitchcock blondes. Lucie Mannheim as Annabella Smith is hilarious as the mystery woman.<br />The themes of paranoia, suspicion, and the relentlessness of human nature are common to Hitchcock, but here they are spun together with frothy, witty dialog and some memorable, finely acted scenes.
0898159156|3.0|I really dug the pictures in there, they were really groovy. Real good flesh eating plant background, solid tips on raising these feisty critters. Didnt work for me though. Had an indoor terrarium and everthing dried up. Sorry.
B000053V7Q|5.0|First time I saw this was at the Governor Ritchie Drive-in theater in Glen Burnie, Maryland, late one August night, and have been fascinated with it ever since.  You will be blown away by the intensity, energy &amp; moves this guy has. This is the best concert footage available on Elvis.  The other documentary filmed two years later, ELVIS ON TOUR (1972)runs a very close 2nd.  This video shows Elvis looking, singing, &amp; moving at his best.  For many, it is a revalation that Elvis was so trim in 1970 or 72.  When you think of Elvis in the 70's, you think of a heavy set performer, but it was only the last couple years of the 70's that he actually became overweight.   I will go out on a limb &amp; say this video will convert anyone who is not an elvis fan.
B00005QK3W|5.0|This record reminds me the spirit of ABBEY ROAD B side and RAM. Full of ideas and bright all over. As those records mentioned probably there is not a HEY JUDE nor a BAND ON THE RUN but is substituted by an endless sucetion of bright ideas and energy. The songs are not obvious and raise the interest to dig in because, beside other considerations, everything sounds new and fresh. Artistically a step forward, not pretentious but intuitive. My fabs so far: About you, Magic, from a lover, and the hymn freedom (now hes got his &quot;give peace a chance&quot; live as well) and ... well it is all great including the experiment Rinse the raindrops (this is like Helter Skelter, you might like it or hate it). Excellent and talented record.
6304479689|5.0|Fantastic footage.  Who would have ever thought that you could combine karate with music?  It sure looks good when executed by a black belt in Kenpo Karate, which Elvis was.  As is typical with many early 70's footage, there is a split screen effect occasionally.  That is, you can see different angles of Elvis all in one shot, or various band members, audience, etc all in one viewing.  This is great if you have a large screen TV or see it at the Drive in theater, like I did.  I would hope that when it is released on DVD, the split screen version will be dispensed, and available as an optional camera angle at the click of the remote.  If you ain't an Elvis fan, you are likely to be afterward, but I suggest seeing the other concert movie, Elvis-That's The Way It Is, first.

B00001OH82|4.0|Seems a lot of people dissed this when it came out - to me, it <BR>seemed like the best thing Bowie had done since &quot;Heroes&quot;, a <BR>return to the raw, dark, grinding guitar-based rock that had <BR>formed the classic Ziggy and Diamond Dogs albums. The lyrics<BR>were totally out of nowhere - Bowie does protest/social <BR>consciousness? - but they _worked_. Frankly I think the cover<BR>of Lennon's &quot;Working Class Hero&quot; is worth the price of the<BR>whole album, as is the devastating &quot;I Can't Read&quot; (a song that<BR>should be played back to back with Midnight Oil's &quot;Read About<BR>It&quot;). No, Reeves Gabriel is no Adrian Belew or Earl Slick, but<BR>he certainly gives Mick Ronson a run for the money.
630339406X|5.0|I went to high school with Tom Hanks (even was in Drama classes with him) and this is the real deal.  Indeed, the Tom I remember probably didn't even have to act very much for this movie.  (He's obviously grown up a bit since this was filmed).<br />Anyhow, this a charming film.  The real message for most of us is to try to look at the world - at least on occasion - with the eyes of a child.  See the absurdities and laugh at what is genuinely funny.  And, most of all, eat those minature corn cobs just like a big corn on the cob.
B00001OH82|4.0|Seems a lot of people dissed this when it came out - to me, it <BR>seemed like the best thing Bowie had done since &quot;Heroes&quot;, a <BR>return to the raw, dark, grinding guitar-based rock that had <BR>formed the classic Ziggy and Diamond Dogs albums.

B00005OM4N|5.0|Can Britney do no wrong, admitidly shes not to everyones taste, but if you dont like it then dont listen.  This is Britney's third album and her best to date, thst is constantly good all of the way through.  The standout tracks on this labum are Slave To U, Let Me Be, Boombastic Love, Boys and I Love Rock N Roll.  This cd has showed that Britney has the staying power and is still adored by millions all around the globe

B00005NWM3|1.0|Wow, what a pile.  This is how this band reminds me of all the other top 40 MTV bands that I've ever heard, all smashed together with pretty girl videos and pretty long hair and a cute guitarist.<br />Does anyone remember how to make exciting, creative music anymore?  This thing is so boring, sort of like Linkin Park, Matchbox 20, Bush, Creed, new Incubus, just dull and lifeless.<br />I don't recommend this album.  Please give me something worth listening to.
B000000OTY|5.0|Okay, I could wish for some of the earlier songs - but that was<BR>true even of the earlier &quot;Peter Gabriel Plays Live.&quot; I fear we<BR>will never have good live versions of &quot;Moribund&quot; or &quot;White Shadow.&quot;<BR>And I could wish for a few more instrumental numbers like &quot;Slow<BR>Marimbas.&quot; I could wish &quot;Don't Give Up&quot; had been replaced by any<BR>of a dozen better songs.<br />But that would be quibbling, when this is absolutely the most <BR>powerful live album since the Who's original &quot;Live at Leeds.&quot; <BR>The songs are one and all performed better, more passionately<BR>and powerfully, than on their studio versions; Gabriel's<BR>almost mystical connection with his audiences flows out of<BR>the speakers and reaches you at home. And I'm not a dancer, but<BR>the heat of the rhythms just gets me up and _moving_.<br />For me, _the_ album of the 1990s.
B00005JKOV|5.0|Most people will not truly understand this movie, as most people are little more than herd animals.  To those who even begin to &quot;get it,&quot; this film will be nothing less than a masterpiece.  Almost every word spoken in this film has meaning, and is important.  Unfortunately, most people are not trained to think or care about the world around them, the nature of the self, God, the universe, evolution, the false dichotomy of dreaming versus waking life, etc., all of which are prevalent themes.  It's too bad.  This is perhaps the most spiritually profound movie made in recent times, and the incredible amount of knowledge presented in it will be lost on the vast majority of viewers, even those who are the sort to check out artsy films.<br />Multiple viewings will be required -- I can't wait for this flick to come out on DVD.  The animation is incredible, and fits together perfectly with the story (yes, there is a story -- THE story, as the pinball-playing fellow at the end relates).
B00005OWIU|5.0|You shouldn't be reading this review; you should know better than to question John Williams' talent.  A lot of people were looking for this to be the breakout, youthful, vibrant adventure score that blew past the music from Hook, which it, admittedly, fails to surpass, but not without making a truly superb effort that creates one of the greatest musical experiences available.  Perhaps it cannot overcome Hook because of the darker origin of the Potter world; the music intimates this idea, creating the indication of a score that more closely acquiesces with Williams' work on Episode I than his other children's scores.<br />At the heart, of course, are several great themes--it would not be a Williams score without them.  You have no doubt already been hammered over the head by them through the marketing campaign.  But they are, needless to say, magical.  Hedwig's theme is just what one would expect for the film, and does nothing less than define the World of Witches from the very first note.  Another theme, the more sober, heroic theme is reminiscent, I feel, of The Patriot, only--without a doubt--better.  It is a truly rousing piece of music, best exemplified in the second track: Harry's Wondrous World.  Meanwhile, an action theme is interspersed--probably used primarily in Quidditch situations--that relies heavily on what Williams did at the Pod Race from Episode I.<br />But, it is my opinion that the true definition of a successful film score lies not in the themes, but in a successful development and dispersement of that theme over the fascinating and unique underscore that cannot relent on account of the scene.  In this area, Potter pales in comparison to Hook, but, in fact, this is some of the best work Williams has ever done; there are choral passages that will take your breath away, folk instruments that set a unique and jolly mood, lively and sneaky sounds to exploit the slyness of Harry &amp; co.  All of this, mixed into and around those main themes of the film, create a consistent listen from start to finish that honors the books and no doubt spells the film's success.<br />Harry Potter is, in short, exactly what everyone expected, exactly what everyone wanted, and almost exactly what everyone got.  Every track has its own piece of magic, and the key theme tracks play, making one interested in the Potter universe immediately. The score proves to be so entirely perfect, that its place in movie history is assured as equally as its effecaciousness in the film, forming a masterpiece that captures everything one would expect from J.K. Rowling's inventive masterwork.
0764005685|5.0|In my opinion, Phenomena is Argento's most under rated film and it's easily my favorite. What I really enjoyed about it was that it has a surreal, dreamlike quality and builds a disorienting, creepy atmosphere. What other film can boast a murderous dwarf, swarming insects, a sleepwalker who can talk to bugs, piles of maggots and a razor-weilding monkey? Jennifer Connolly is very easy on the eyes, and the soundtrack moves from a moody score by the Goblins to 80s hair metal, giving it an appropriate amount of cheese and livening things up a bit. The end chase scene / climax of the movie is also pretty shocking. Like nearly all of his other movies, the dialogue is stilted and the plot a bit incoherent, but Connolly gives the lead role some charisma and the movie looks great; no one goes to see this kind of movie for a logical plot and taut, snappy dialogue anyway. A very good film, and much more of a fairy tale than any of Argento's other movies; I highly recommend it.

B00005Q66T|5.0|What hasn't she done? What hasn't she been called? Madonna has been around since early 1982 until the present. Her first greatest hits collection, The Immaculate Collection, shows Madonna becoming a star and then creating an image for herself. In 1995 Madonna released Something to Remember a greatest ballad collection. Which shows off Madonnas sad, soft side. Now in 2001 Madonna has realesed GHV2 (Greatest Hits Volume 2). This Collection focuses on Madonna becoming a person rather than the Celebrity that she already is. It starts off in late 92 with the realeses of Erotica and Deeper And Deeper. Then it takes you to 94 with the songs Secret, Take A Bow, Human Nature, and Bedtime Story. Then it brings you to 98 with the reales of Ray Of Light, Frozen and The Power Of Goodbye. Finally it brings you to the present with the songs Music and Don't Tell Me. Altough this compilation is missing a few tracks (I'll Remember, Rain, and This Used to Be My Playground) it is still one of my favorite Madonna Albums ever. It shows Madonna evolving from the sex queen of the 90's, to the R&amp;B white girl, to the Kabbalah practioner, to the electronica cow girl.
B00005Q66T|5.0|How many artists in popular music today manage to pull off 3 greatest hits albums in less than 20 years? Not very many. What can be said about Madonna's &quot;GHV2&quot; other than congratulations to her. This collection is filled with singles that have undisputedly become pop classics - &quot;Deeper And Deeper,&quot; &quot;Secret,&quot; &quot;Take A Bow,&quot; &quot;Frozen,&quot; &quot;Ray Of Light,&quot; &quot;The Power Of Good-Bye,&quot; &quot;Beautiful Stranger,&quot; &quot;Music,&quot; &quot;Don't Tell Me,&quot; just look at the track listing. Those cuts all stood the test of time - and then some. Also featured are singles that were only &quot;moderate&quot; hits but have become classics anyway (how many artists can say that about their lesser-known songs?) like &quot;Bedtime Story,&quot; &quot;Human Nature,&quot; &quot;Drowned World,&quot; et. al. The songs all speak for themselves. If you don't have this, get it. No pop collection is complete without it. Along with &quot;The Immaculate Collection&quot; and &quot;Something To Remember,&quot; &quot;GHV2&quot; is yet another chapter in a legendary career.
B00005R2M3|5.0|I think that Laundry Service is really, really great. We realize that Shakira is growing and she's showing her talent. Her english is very good and songs like \\"the one\\" and \\"Underneath your clothes\\" shows that he can perform ballads very well, But also More Pop-Rock songs like \\"Fool\\" or \\"Poem to a horse\\". However, I think that this album is more Pop than her previous one \\"Donde Estan los ladrones\\". The traslation of ojos asi (Eyes like yours) (is bad), it's not the same in english. If you really want to discover a great artist, with talent to write, rythm and a great voice you should consider buying shakira's laundry service. Alanis fan? Well, if you like her you'd like shakira too. They're very similar in style, but I think that alanis is a bit more rocker. Who's the best? Well, It's a close ending.... Just enjoy them both.
B000005HN6|5.0|I have to go back 30 years to compare these guys to anyone else. King Crimson also merged many styles to make a new type of music. They even had &quot;unclean&quot; vocals {21st Century Man}. Akerfeldt and company continue that tradition. Mixing hard and soft better than anyone today, Opeth creates albums that grow on you the more you hear them. All I can say is buy this one first and then progress on through all five of their modern classics. It is great that there are still musicians that make this kind of music.
B00005R2M3|5.0|Shakira's English debut is more than great, its a piece of art that shows the hard-work of a girl who is extremely talented! She grows up more on this album, focusing most of her songs on love and good times. However for those of you who still love the &quot;old&quot; shakira, there is still plenty for you(Eyes Like Yours, Poem to a Horse, and Fool). Everything from her poppy &quot;Objection&quot; to the rock &quot;Poem to a Horse&quot; to the middle-eastern beats of &quot;Eyes Like Yours&quot; and &quot;Ready for the Good Times&quot; which seems to come from a different time, there is something for everyone on this CD. definately a buy!!!!!!
B00005R23S|4.0|First-off I love Bruce Springsteen - ever since the 70's when I worked in a Sam Goody music store near Asbury Park, NJ, and he and other band members would often visit the store. We all loved the Boss! I still love cruising in my Mustang convertible playing &quot;Badlands&quot;, &quot;Candy's Room&quot; or &quot;Born to Run&quot; at way-too-loud levels!<br /> This DVD has a shot on film look that is very clean, but maybe a bit too slick - I felt disengaged from the performers. Others I've seen have been better at making me feel like I'm really there (Like 38 Special - Live at Sturgis&quot; or Mary Chapin Carpenter - Live at Wolf Trap&quot;). A lot of the old standards are there, and I loved every one. Bruce spends a lot of time stretching out songs with non-musical interludes - preaching in a James Brown kind-of &quot;salvation of Rock and Roll&quot;, etc. It goes on WAY too long. Extended endings and non-solo breaks in the music had me fast-forwarding to the next song quite often. While I gripe about some of the production, the sound is great and Bruce, Clarence and the gang still &quot;got it&quot; after all these years. It was great to see the E Street Band back in action - Bruce really shines with them. I was especially impressed with Max Weinberg - who drove the tempo really well, Nils Lofgren who had some very interesting solos and a favorite of mine - Dan Frederici who did a great job on organ and accordian.<br />If you love Bruce, or just plain Rock and Roll, you must own this DVD!
B00005R2M3|5.0|Shakira is one of the best female singer/song writers that ever lived . Her Spanish work is amazing and this proved that her English work is too. She's a name that everyone will be hearing soon. If you like artists like Sheryl Crow, Sarah Mclachlan and Jewel, you will probably like Shakira's music. But Shakira's music is a little bit more diverse and you can actually dance to some of her songs too. The best songs on this cd are &quot;The One&quot;, &quot;Underneath Your Clothes&quot; , and &quot;Fool&quot;, but every song has something different to offer. There are various music styles used in this cd from Led Zepellin to middle eastern to dance to tango to South American andinas music all blended tastefully to create a masterpiece.
B000002GF8|5.0|The Police's masterpiece that solidified their place in music history, as one of the greatest bands of all time.  Synchronicity is the proof of the Police's evolution from &quot;fake punk&quot;.  Of course, Synchronicity is mostly known for the Grammy Award winning &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot; (WHICH IS NOT A LOVE SONG)...but the rest of the album is a work of art.  Other singles like &quot;King of Pain&quot; and &quot;Wrapped Around Your Finger&quot; showcases Sting's amazing lyrical writing.  &quot;Synchronicity II&quot; also won a Grammy for best rock song.  Even though all but two songs were written by Sting, the two songs that are usually overlooked were &quot;Mother&quot; written by Andy Summers and &quot;Miss Gradenko&quot; written by Stewart Copeland, both deserving as much recognition as the rest of the album.  Overall, Synchronicity has it all, and it was Sting, Stewart, and Andy's gift to the musical world...before they left us.
0385505833|4.0|Skipping Christmas is a hoot!  In a much lighter tone than Charles Dickens' \\"A Christmas Carol,\\" and possessing the sentimentality of the children's book, \\"The Polar Express,\\" John Grisham shows us again why he is a best selling author. Luther Krank, the tale's modern day Scrooge, decides that Christmas is too commercialized and too expensive for the Krank household after his daughter leaves for a stint in the Peace Corps that will keep her in South America for the holidays. Deciding to forgo the office party, christmas cards, outdoor decorations, mall shopping, tree trimming and the rest of the holiday chaos, Krank proclaims to everyone that he and his wife are going to take a cruise and \\"skip christmas\\" this year.  Bah humbug!  He doesn't know what he is in for!<br />If after reading Skipping Christmas you think that Grisham isn't very original and just updated the characters and town depicted in &quot;It's A Wonderful Life,&quot; you may have a point. Sure Luther Krank at times seems like George Bailey; Krank's Hemlock Street  neighborhood is a lot like Bedford Falls; and even police officers Salino and Treen resemble the loveable cab driver and policeman Bert and Ernie. But why complain; now you have two versions of the story to enjoy during the holidays! You can even decide whether  Jimmy Stewart would make a better Luther Krank than George Bailey.<br />The holiday season brings a lot of happiness to many who don't often have it during the rest of the year. This year we all need it; and we all deserve it.  So don't wait for someone else to tell you this book is worth the purchase, go out and get it now.  Light the fire, pour yourself a glass of eggnog, sit back and enjoy this book. By the time the fire turns to embers, you'll be glad you didn't skip this one. And if your name happens to be Ebeneezer, I promise that you won't have to admit you actually enjoyed the story.
B00005R2M3|5.0|Shakira does a great job with her spanish/english translations (ojos asi/eyes like yours, suerte/whenever whereever, te aviso te anuncio/objection) because she does not lose the meaning of the songs between words. The other songs like underneath your clothes and the one are beautiful ballads filled to the top with emotion and honesty. Shakira is incredibly talented and she is also good with the rock songs (te dejo madrid, ready for the good times, que me quedes tu) which are up beat and sound very professional. while i agree this isnt shakira's best work to date, i must say that this is an amazing cd for gringo fans. go buy it!!!
B00005R2M3|5.0|I spent the last 2 years in South America, and I could not believe the impact that Shakira has had on the culture in that part of the world.  She is ever much an example of staying star power to the Latin world as the Material Girl is to ours.<br />Ever since I first heard her on &quot;Antología&quot; one night in Ecuador, I was mezmerized by Shakira's vocal style and writing ability.  She is truly an artist, in every sense of the word, by far beating out the low talent, mass produced acts we see today in unoriginal boy bands and teen hearthrobs in skimpy clothing.  While she may be just as flesh bearing at times, Shakira is something quite different altogether.<br />I love this new album.  I find it amazing that she was able to produce a true crossover album by herself, with such detail and poise.  Sure, some of the songs don't have the fluidity of classic Shakespeare or even Paul Simon... but, this is an expression of art, the essence of great music, for it comes from the soul.  Let the critics try and bring the mighty queen of Latin rock down by commenting on her grammar or choice of words.  The truth is, this girl is truly everything... exciting, passionate, and devoted to what she does best... ENTERTAINING.  <br />If you haven't experienced Shakira yet, Laundry Service is a great place to start, and certainly worthy of the hype it has gotten as of late.  Take it from someone who knew about her long before...  Shakira is here to stay.  Gracias, Shakira por habernos bendecido tanto con tu talento y ritmos... te aceptamos y te amamos... Bienvenido a nuestro mundo.
B000056K04|2.0|When I first got this disc several months ago, I hated it. But, sometimes things grow on you and you learn to appreciate qualities that you didn't pick up on initially. That has not happened here, in fact, I may actually dislike it even more now. Bottom line is that the disc feels like it was pulled together in a week with drab and uninspiring songwriting. I've always felt that DMB's first three major label records were excellent, but this one is a big disappointment.
0060987464|5.0|I really loved his autobiography. It's very interesting and you never what to quit reading it.
6305013578|1.0|Just for all those people waiting for a better version of Metropolis: there's a new restoration! Yes, they've showed it here in Rotterdam (too bad I didn't know, I read it in the papers afterwards) and the reviews are very good. It seems to be a restoration that began in 1998 and was finished in 2000. I'll just wait till that version is on DVD.
B00005AWMF|5.0|The first song I remember hearing from her was when I was little, not sure how old I was, but the song was 'Smooth Operator'.  I asked my mom who was singing that, and she told me it was Sade.  I finally got to hear some more of her music later on (19), since I really didn't follow up (I was like 8 or 9).  I started listening to the smooth jazz station and heard some of her songs.  I had to find out what they were.  I got the titles down of the songs I liked.  My favorite from her, is 'Is It A Crime'.  I can listen to that song over and over.  I don't have the cd yet, but I know for a fact I like 11 of the 16 songs.  And in my book, that's a cd to have.  =)  So, do I recommend it?  Without a doubt.  I plan on getting her other 4 cds, already have Lovers Rock.
0345350499|5.0|Marion Zimmer Bradley, who passed away last year, left to her readers both old and new, one of the most enduring legacies of modern literature. The Mists of Avalon is a glorious retelling of the Arthurian saga by one of its most maligned characters--that of Morgan le Fay.<br /><br /> To call this book a &quot;feminist fable&quot; is to do it a great injustice, and frankly, lends itself to charges of sexism. No one calls Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur a paen to masculine virtues; historically speaking, Malory's work was greatly influenced by Eleanor of Aquitaine's famous Courts of Love. Any spurious charges of feminism leveled against Ms. Bradley's book merely rise from the fact that the main characters of the book are all the women behind Arthur's throne; Morgan (called Morgaine in the novel), Guinevere (Gwenhyfar), and Viviane, Lady of the Lake.<br /><br /> Morgaine has emerged as one of my all-time favourite characters in literature; she is a complex woman both ahead of her time, and yet greatly of her time. Gwenhyfar is just as complex, and at first reading, is a thoroughly disagreeable character. That is, until one realizes that she too, is as much a woman of her times. Much of Ms. Bradley's genius lay in her ability to fully flesh out her characters, to make them real to the reader.<br /><br /> This novel also introduced many to the idea of a goddess-centered spirituality (i.e. paganism/wicca) without being preachy. To be honest, I found Morgaine's path to be just as trying and just as demanding as Christianity is to its adherents.<br /><br /> A few detractors have claimed that Mists of Avalon was/is a &quot;recruitment guide&quot; to feminist spirituality, and that Christianity was painted as a hateful religion--unfortunately, these people are the victims of their own biases. Much of early Christianity was rather backwards in its views of women (a view which sadly hasn't progressed all that greatly). To be fair, Ms. Bradley once again proved her impeccable scholarship in showing the ties that early Christianity and the pagan faiths of Old Britain shared--the story of Joseph of Arimathea, who supposedly founded the first church upon Glastonbury Tor, and who worshipped alongside the Druids. She wrote of Pre-Nicean Christianity, which did not seem to have any issues with the pagans of Britain. Still, put oneself in Morgaine's shoes--having to defend one's beliefs against ignorance and superstition (though it was that same 'superstition' that many called on when it came to tending the sick because of her vast knowledge of herb lore). Morgaine was forced to defend even the basic freedoms of women (to be learned) against those who felt that women were not 'created' to read and write.<br /><br /> I also see the problem some of the detractors have is in our very Western notion of 'good gys v. bad guys'. Many people like things simplified, and to read a book that doesn't wrap everything up in a tidy little box has got to be rather disappointing. 'The Mists of Avalon' transcended this outdated notion, peopling its pages with characters who are just as 'real' and as multifacted in their emotions as we ourselves are. As I said before, I no longer have the animosity towards Gwenhyfar that I did when I first read the book many years ago. Now when I re-read 'Mists', she has come to earn my pity and my understanding. And in her own way, she too was a very strong and determined woman.<br /><br /> I have read this book about a good 100 times (I'm not kidding), and with each re-read, I come away with more insight into the human condition. This is a novel that should be read and shared and discussed by everyone. It should be judged for the quality of the writing and for the depth of characterization it brings, both which are immense, and a lasting tribute to the brilliant mind who penned it.ties that early Christianity and the pagan faiths of Old Britain shared--the story of Joseph of Arimathea, who supposedly founded the first church upon Glastonbury Tor, and who worshipped alongside the Druids.

0780020685|2.0|didnt like this movie at all. did not find it beautiful, did not find any of the characters even remotely interesting. in fact if you asked me i could not tell you who the main character was. Kurosawa was praised for his camera work, in showing all the major characters, but that's exactly the problem. yes the characters were major but WHO was the main? also, for a film that sets the standard for action films, ive watched almost all of it (prolly 1 hour lefT) and havent seen one fighting sequence. or anything.
B00005Q66T|5.0|The second greatest hits from the most significant female artist of our time! Undoubtedly so, for Madonna has sold over 150 million albums and 50 million singles worldwide. Not only a commercial success, Madonna has managed to come off as a talented musician and performer while juggling the roles of a mother and a wife.<br />This greatest hits is the companion to 1990's 22-million selling The Immaculate collection, something everyone should have known by now. It spans the years from 1991-2001. At the very first glance, the lack of a new song but yet a massive promo campaign might have seem like an attempt at lame commercialism by Warner Bros. In fact, reports said that Madonna didn't want this release so soon. Whichever the case, this 15-track collection stacks up quite nicely with The Immaculate Collection. Obviously, Madonna has enough hits to fill another CD, and these hits were left off to prevent the cannibalization of past catalog album sales. The ommission of new tracks or unreleases songs has again touched the nerves of some fans, nbut no one is ever happy with any tracklist, so these 15 songs are what you'll ever get.<br />The standard edition comes with plenty of small Madonna pictures and a nice design by Grammy-winning art director Kevin Regan who seems to be Madonna's staple creative personnel.<br />Though The Immaculate Collection was largely energetic and truly a milestone in Madonna's career, GHV2 represents a different era for Madonna altogether. It's Madonna constantly rediscovering herself in the 90's with the earlier hits Erotica and Deeper and Deeper. Though excellent songs, they really suffered at the Sex backlash. Erotica, for one, still evokes the kind of mystism and sensuality today. Human Nature, in its clean form (...), shows the world that Madonna had no regrets for what she had done, with a ooh-so-hot video to accompany. When Madonna was hot and sexy, where were those Jennifers and Britneys? Don't Cry For Me Argentina may seem like a sore thumb sticking out of nowhere, but it is really to show the evolution of Madonna into the next stage and paving for her second milestone with Ray Of Light. 4 tracks from the Grammy-winning album show up here including the incredible song Drowned World/Substitute For Love where Madonna lamented about the price of fame over love. This song and Ray Of Light, are some of the highlights here. From her Music album, there's of course the huge title track and the two splendid follow-ups Don't Tell Me and What It Feels Like For A Girl.<br />Once you pop this CD into your player, you are unlikely to stop cos the 15 tracks here, believe it or not, capture the true essence of Madonna in the last decade. From kink to art to spirituality and funk. No one can beat Madonna and no one ever will, in artistry and craft. <br />Long live, the Queen!!!!
6305308659|5.0|I watched this movie whenever it came on cable and I have probably seen it about ten times. Unfortunately, it has not been on STARZ for quite a while. I decided to buy this DVD because I have not seen the movie in a while. <br />Pleasantville is a really interesting movie that I would definitely recommend movie lovers to see. Personally, I think that it was one of the best films to come out during the last five years.
B00005OM4N|3.0|Just when you thought Miss Spears is over, she spings up with her third offering in a span of barely two years. Cashing in on her hotter than steel status, this third offering has sold over 700k in the USA the first week. Just imagine the teenage fanbase and you'll know. The other 300k who bought her second offering might have outgrown Britney a little, hence the fall in sales.<br /><br />On this disc, Miss Spears tries to shed her sweet bubblegum image by returning with a hot and sassy (not sexy) video for I'm A Slave For You. Though I hate to admit it, the Neptunes-helmed song does sound incredibly funky and groovy even though most would give credits to the performer rather than the songwriters and/or producers. And obviously, caught right smack in the middle of girl and womanhood, Miss Spears sings I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman. Almost like a Britney-standard, she covers yet another classic, I Love Rock and Roll. While she did a relatively good job for I Get No Satisfaction from the Rolling Stones on Oops, she sounds ok here. Other songs that might benefit from radio/videoplay are likely to be Overprotected and Let It Be. The rest of the album acts like a filler for the more prominent hits.<br /><br />Overall, Britney's style remains largely intact with her slightly whiny and nasal voice. The album still doesn't serve much of a purpose except for filling up those boring moments on the bus or train. If all goes well, Britney will STILL earn her X times platinum awards and buy herself more time in this manufactured and fickle teen-pop world. For a 20-year-old, leaping into adult world NEXT may prove to be a gigantic step and her 4th album will show if she's meant to STAY.<br /><br />The album still soen't serve much of a purpose except for some
B00005R2M3|2.0|I can barely understand the english??? She definately has the talent to be a star here in the US but she has to do her own work. Obviously on this album she had to mimic the way too old teen style instead of her own style. Her music is much better in spanish
0679600019|4.0|Wow. Oscar Wilde was a funny, funny man. One of his goals in writing fiction must have been to leave at least one potential quote on each page. As you read this, book, you will encounter dozens of quips you heard used by your English professors. It is interesting to note that it was this book that got the obscenity trials started for Mr. Wilde.
031286504X|5.0|This is one of the few books that I can honestly say that I could not put down.  I finished it in a week and a half of visits to my local bookstore, simply perusing it over midafternoon tea.<br />I am Legend tells the story of the last man on Earth, actually the last truly human man on Earth.  Apparently, there was a nuclear war as well as biological warfare(?).  Anyway, the combination of the two weapons generated a bacteria that's transmitted by mosquito bites and windstorms (a result of the nukes),infecting humans and causing them to turn into vampires.  Much of the book deals with this man Neville's search for a way to end his lonliness (at times he considers suicide, at other times he considers locating other humans).  You can truly empathize with his struggle to justify his existence.<br />The other major prime mover of the plot is the protagonist's investigation into the vampire phenomenon.  He plays the amateur scientist trying to discover the origin of the vampires, their biological processes, and their weaknesses.  There is a kind of macabre fascination that he has with regard to his vampiric enemies.  On the one hand, he hates them for their persecution of him.  On the other hand, he feels some degree of pity for these unfortunate mutants, some of whom were his friends and neighbors.<br />There are some really suspenseful scenes in which you can feel how he is constantly pursued by these vampires at night - the feeling of perpetual besiegement is palpable.  The one scene in which he loses track of the time and is racing in his car to get back to his house/fortress before the vamps come out really had my heart pounding for a while.  The ending is somewhat ironic - a play on the book's title - and reminiscent of the Salem witch trials.
0440219078|5.0|Every once in a while, a book comes along that changes the way we look at ourselves and at the world in which we live.  The Giver is one of those books.  The writing style is deceptively simple; the prose conveys controversial and explosive ideas and issues with incredible clarity.  This is truly an incredible book...     for readers of all ages.
B00005ASQ1|5.0|Every day, Jamal (Rob Brown VI) looks up at the upper-corner Bronx apartment from the neighborhood basketball court.  He and his friends wonder who it is staring through the shades back at them.  Their curiosity peaks, and Jamal is chosen to discover the deep, dark secret of the person behind the window.  Little does he know, finding Forrester (Sean Connery) could change his life forever; and likewise, finding Jamal just might be what Forrester needs, too.<br />This is a good film for those who aspire to break out of the ruts of society, and dare to dream, dream big.  Moreover, it is a movie that conveys the truth that we all need each other, and that we bring our own unique gifts to the table of life.<br />Sean Connery, one of my all-time favorite actors, is wonderful in the lead role of William Forrester, the reclusive award-winning author, as is Brown in his role as Jamal.  You can find Forrester by clicking on Amazon.com!
B000020617|5.0|Following &quot;The Colour and the Shape&quot; was a very hard thing to do.  The Foo would have to rock and then rock even more.  Did they?  Um... Hell yeah!<br />This time around, they don't waste any time.  &quot;Stacked Actors&quot; kicks the album off in pure rockin' fashion.  To follow, The Foo take rockin' pop to a new level with &quot;Breakout&quot;.  The heavily played &quot;Learn to Fly&quot; comes next, sure to please all the people who like radio-friendly rock songs.  &quot;Gimme Stitches&quot; continues with the &quot;Rock your socks off&quot; theme.<br />&quot;Aurora&quot; is your first glimpse into what Foo is all about: the sheer ability to make any type of song their own.  The tempo is slower, the melodies are beautiful, but it still holds the Foo Fighter quality of great rock-pop.  &quot;Live-In Skin&quot; comes next.  If you can find a better overall rock song, let me know.  Enough Said.<br />&quot;Next Year&quot; follows in &quot;Aurora's&quot; footsteps with pretty melodies and even better lyrics.  &quot;Headwires&quot; and &quot;Ain't It the Life&quot; follow and keep the album feeling whole.  And then comes &quot;M.I.A.&quot;.<br />This, in my opinion, is Foo Fighters perfection.  Until their next album, and possibly for long after, this is the best song they have to offer.  It starts out slow, rocks, slows down, and then rocks again.  Overall, it does what all of the other songs they've recorded have tried to do: Represent the Foo Fighters.  This is the song I would play if anyone asked me &quot;Why do you like the Foo Fighters so much?&quot;  If you like great rock music, you will absolutely fall in love with this song.<br />I highly recommend this album.  If you don't own any Foo yet, shame on you!  They are a force to be reckoned with and they will be for years to come.
B00005Q66T|5.0|If Madonna has included old songs that weren't hits, is to have people review them from a different point of view... As time has passed, all of us have matured, so let's give a chance to those songs that weren't #1...

B000002UKS|5.0|This album rocks from start (sort of) to finish.  &quot;Colour&quot; was Dave Grohl's answer to everyone who wrote him off as &quot;nothing but the drummer from Nirvana&quot;.  He proved to the world that he (and his bandmates, available for the first time here) could make an album full of great songs.  If it wasn't evident on &quot;Foo Fighters&quot;, it is here: Dave knows how to make good hard-rockin' pop songs.<br />The album starts with the innocent &quot;Doll&quot; and never looks back.  &quot;Monkey Wrench&quot; follows and proceeds to rock your socks off.  &quot;Hey, Johnny Park&quot; and &quot;My Poor Brain&quot; come next and take your socks off the floor and rock them even harder.  &quot;Wind Up&quot; continues the trend and leaves you expecting more.  <br />But low and behold, Mr. Grohl slows it down a bit with &quot;Up In Arms&quot;, wich changes the pace a bit, but rocks when it needs to.  &quot;My Hero&quot; follows and shows you just how much pop has influenced him.  &quot;See You&quot; takes the same direction as &quot;Arms&quot; and then &quot;Enough Space&quot; kicks you in the face with it's all out tour de force of ROCK!  &quot;February Stars&quot; is the albums prettiest song, although the lyrics still escape me.<br />Next is &quot;Everlong&quot;.  If you haven't heard this song, why?  This is, perhaps, the best song that Dave Grohl has to offer.  It simply shines (on an album that... um, I don't know... ROCKS!!).  &quot;Walking After You&quot; is as close to a pure love song as the Foo will ever get and is also very great in its alternate form found on th X-Files soundtrack.  &quot;New Way Home&quot; ends the disc in wonderful fashion.  Until their follow-up, this was my favorite Foo Fighters song.  It has the same pop feel of the rest of the album, but delves deeper into your psyche as the chorus is repeated many times over growing louder and louder with each turn (And thus ROCKING more and more with each turn).<br />To put it very simply: This album ROCKS!!!  If you've ever heard a Foo songs that you thought was good but never bought an album, buy this one NOW!  EVERY SONG IS GOOD!  And that's more than you can say about pretty much every album out there.
B00005QK3W|2.0|Worst if not the worst album.   I can't believe someone compared this album to Ram in one of the reviews.  These lyrics are so predictable I find that I could sing the next line before Paul did my first time listening to most of it. (...)
B00000269M|5.0|I grew up almost solely on this album and I'm sure many 80s children can relate to that. A little too young when Thriller was at it's peak it was the relative pop perfection of &quot;Bad&quot; that appealed to this young child and a few million other new inductees. This is not to say it doesn't stand up to repeated listenings by the more critical adult ears though... it very much does.<br />The title track kicks things off in boastful style, with MJ assuring he's &quot;Bad&quot;. This big hit was initially hoped to be a duet with 80s rival Prince however the line &quot;Your butt is mine...&quot; meant the MPLS Genius was less than enthused. ;)<br />&quot;The Way You Make Me Feel&quot; is a catchy pop effort, recently re-immortalised in his excellent single &quot;Rock My World&quot; (Both concept wise and video scenario).<br />&quot;Speed Demon&quot; is amongst the more experimental music on &quot;Bad&quot; with it's clunking chain sample and unusual tempo. It all works well however as Producer Quincy Jones doesn't allow duds onto any MJ material.<br />&quot;Liberian Girl&quot; is an exotic sounding ballad with a celebrity packed video. &quot;Just Good Friends&quot; is a duet with the legendary Stevie Wonder, a brave move as you just know you can't out-do that man! MJ holds his own however in this funky pop tune. &quot;Another Part Of Me&quot; continues this tempo in good style.<br />&quot;Man In The Mirror&quot; is a very inspiring tune which builds to the familiar gospel finale we expect from MJ's big numbers. &quot;I Just Can't Stop Loving You&quot; is a beautiful love duet with Siedah Garret.<br />The album ends in very strong style with the final three tracks. &quot;Dirty Diana&quot; is a superb atmospheric song which makes use of great guitar work and crowd samples. It seemed quite spooky when I was younger and remains dark to this day.<br />My album highlight is &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; (Like &quot;The Way You Make Me Feel&quot; it's excellent video was also recycled in the recent &quot;Rock My World&quot;) it's got a superb bassline and addictive melody. It's a real shame that to many it's more associated with Alien Ant Farm now after their parody cover version.<br />&quot;Leave Me Alone&quot; begins MJ's disillusionment with the attention he gets (Leading to &quot;Scream&quot; etc) and is a fitting end to the CD album.<br />Though not even approaching the commercial success of Thriller's sales it still easily slots in alongside it, &quot;Off The Wall&quot; and the underrated &quot;Dangerous&quot; in terms of quality. This is a great compliment in such legendary company.
B0000046ZJ|5.0|This is a nice, enjoyable and long CD (unlike some of his bossa nova ones that are 35 minutes).  I like all of his bossa nova stuff much better, but if you want non-bossa nova Getz, this is pretty darn good.

B00005LOUP|3.0|The live version of &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&quot; is a childrens delight when it comes to Art Direction, Scenery, etc., however the movies misses quite a few items from the cartoon.<br />The dog that they had played Grinchs family friend is totally the opposite of the cartoon, they needed a wired-haired dachshund or a beagle to play the part.<br />The movie misses on getting to know the characters of Whoville, hardly ever going into their homes and see how they really live, and they rush past the storyline when Grinch steals everything in Cindy Lou Whos home.  Cindy had brothers and sisters, and in the movie she is a lonely child.<br />The movie is a art direction marvel to look at, and Jim Carrey is excellent as the Grinch, as is Christine Baranski, Molly Shannon and Jeffrey Tambor as the Mayor of Whoville.<br />However for a 2 hour movie it doesn't delve into the Whoville world like the 30 minute cartoon....and why? especially when they have more film time.<br />For children it is a fun movie, just for me growing up on &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&quot; it just misses a beat.<br />They didn't even sing around Whoville long enough after everything was missing, and that was my favorite song from the cartoon.<br />Still a cute movie, but as Hollywood goes they always have to change something.
B000002505|3.0|This album is an intriguing and informal meeting between two masterful jazz guitarists.  Unfortunately the result isn't especially masterful -- some of the compositions are just vehicles for fast and ultimately meaningless guitar duels.  But the lengthy (and lengthy-titled) &quot;Let Us Go House into the House of the Lord&quot;, something clicks.  Over a nice groove that's greatly enhanced by Larry Young's organ doodles and Armando Peraza's bongos, McLaughlin and Santana stretch out and produce genuinely ecstatic music.  The other two electric tracks (&quot;The Life Divine&quot; and John Coltrane's &quot;Acknowledgment&quot;), on the other hand, aren't much more than speed exercises over functional grooves.  The acoustic tracks are nice but I can take them or leave them.  Overall this isn't either guitarist's best work in the jazz-rock arena -- check out the Inner Mounting Flame or Caravanserai to see them at their best.  But it's nice to hear them play in an unfamiliar setting (neither the Latinisms of Santana nor the bulldozer intensity of the Mahavishnu Orchestra) and on about half of the album it works.  John McLaughlin or Santana completists should pick it up.  And be sure to check out some of Larry Young's albums from the 60s -- Unity or Into Somethin' -- to see what this giant of the B3 organ was truly capable of.
B00003CXZ1|4.0|A friend of mine wanted to go see Lara Croft:Tomb Raider.  I went with him (because I am a good friend).<br />However I was pleasantly surprised by the acting, the action, set design, etc.<br />The plot was not predictable, was on the edge of your seat action.<br />Angelina Jolie who till this day did her best acting in a HBO film called &quot;Gia&quot;, was very good as a action hero, and believable in the tough girl scenario.<br />You cared about the characters and the people that worked for her, and Lara cared about her employees as they were family.<br />It had a &quot;Batman&quot; feel to it in the home department, and was a fun action film.<br />Good action, no fowl language and perfect for 12 and up.  A fun movie to rent.

B00003CXXJ|5.0|I will not give away the ending of &quot;Shrek&quot;, however I am sure the whole country has seen it by now.<br />&quot;Shrek&quot; is well done as cartoons go, one of the best.  The plot is very moral in standing which I liked.  This was a TRUE love story.  Looks nor beauty nor money has anything to do with it.<br />&quot;Shrek&quot; is an absolute must-see for children that will give them a good upstanding idea how this world should really be about people may they be ugly or gorgeous all people should be treated and loved the same.<br />Definitely should be a contender for Oscar as best picture.  A fun, predictable love story with a twist of an ending.  All I can say is when I saw the movie in the theater I am just glad Shrek fell in love with the lady for ALL the right reasons.
0446310786|5.0|I read that Harper Lee never wrote another book because everything she had to say she said in &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird.&quot; And did she! In a heartwarming story, set during the Depression in Alabama, she teaches us all about race, class, justice, and leaving childhood behind. <br />I read this book every other year or so and it just gets better with each reading. I particularly enjoyed my last reading having just finished Melany Neilson's &quot;Persia Cafe.&quot; It is a similar story except that its hero is a young woman named Franny. Both Atticus and Franny are exceptional people who follow their conscience and are rewarded. Also, Leif Enger's &quot;Peace Like A River&quot; has a character that reminded me of Scout. Her name is Swede and she is utterly charming. <br />It is wonderful to be reminded of my favorite characters in &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot; through reading some of the great contemporary fiction that is out there today. If you liked &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot; (and how could you not?!) I would highly recommend either of the two novels previously mentioned in this review.
B00003CY0V|1.0|Overexposed John Travolta is back in another theatrical mess.  &quot;Swordfish&quot; is one of the worst films of 2001, and should win a Rasberry Award for Best Picture come this year.<br />It seems as Travoltas movie career goes full steam ahead he keeps picking more and more horrible films like his Battlefield Earth sci-film of last season, Domestic Disturbance, and the list goes on.<br />Hugh Jackman is unbelievable, Halle Berry couldn't act if her looks depended on it, and the production and script are so weak.<br />AWFUL, AWFUL, AWFUL.  Travolta owes it to his fans to get back on track like &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, &quot;Get Shorty&quot;, etc., or just don't do films at all, your rich enough.

B00005N9CV|1.0|Any album by Ms. Krall is eagerly anticipated. &quot;The Look of Love&quot; is no exception.  The bossa nova flavor harkens back to the 1950s and 1960s bringing to mind those wonderful guitar albums by the late Charlie Byrd. As usual, Diana blends her keyboard artistry with a sultry voice reminencent of 'torch singers' from the past. While a good album, I would have found it more appealing if it had featured more of her keyboard styling. No matter... it is a worthwhile addition to any collection. Cuts that were particulary appealing included the Adair &amp; Dennis tune &quot;A Night We Called it a Day&quot; and Hoagy's &quot;I Get Along without you Very Well&quot;.
B00000DHR0|5.0|Celine captures many of the moods of Christmas on this CD (from spiritual, to political, to sentimental, to fun, to melancholy) and in so doing has made an album that is sure to spawn at least a few standard carols that we will hear for years to come.  Her beautifully understated &quot;Blue Chistmas&quot; is still a revelation, since she so rarely is this mellow.  And for once all the new songs on a Christmas CD are just as good (if not better) than the classic songs presented!  You'll joyfully dance around to &quot;The Magic Of Christmas Day&quot; and &quot;Don't Save It All For Christmas Day&quot;, &quot;These Are the Special Times&quot; and &quot;Another Year Has Gone By&quot; all feature beautiful sentiments and arrangements with catchy melodies, but none rise to a cresondo.  In fact I think Celine haters will be suprised by her overall restraint.<br />Not every song works here (I found &quot;Happy Xmas&quot; and &quot;The Prayer&quot; a bit much to take), but they are the exception and the feeling one is left with is one of pure delight, of being uplifted.  I'm sure some of that has something to do with &quot;Feliz Navidad&quot; and &quot;Les Cloches Du Hameau&quot; (featuring many members of Celine's family) ending the CD, but you can't overlook her talent and artistry.  This one's here to stay.

0743216458|5.0|In true Stephen Ambrose fashion, the story of Easy company is brought to life in this extremely well-written book.  Ambrose takes us through the formation of Easy company in the summer of 1942 to the surrender of Germany in 1945.  The men of Easy are brought to life by Ambrose's excellent dialogue.  In 1942, Easy company was formed.  They trained in Georgia and learned the rigors of jumping from an airplane.  After becoming seasoned paratroopers, these brave men led the way at Normandy by jumping behind enemy lines before the main assult.  Ambrose vividly describes how Easy company destroyed a battery of German artillery while facing overwhelming enemy superiority.  Next came the siege of Bastogne.  Again Easy was at the forefront of the fighting; valiantly defending the town against vastly superior enemy numbers.  After the Normandy campaign, the men of Easy company participated in the largest parachute drop of the war; Operation Market Garden.  Although this was considered an allied &quot;defeat&quot;, the men of Easy company again distinguished themselves on the field of battle.  Finally, Easy company led the assult on Hitler's own &quot;Eagle's Nest&quot; in the last days of the war.  Ambrose brings each member of Easy company to life, from Major Winters, who was adored and respected by his men, to Captain Sobel, who was equally disdained.  This book is a must read for WWII enthusiasts.
B00005QK3W|4.0|At first listen you want to celebrate...it's different, some experimenting and great pop songs...but then there are the typical annoying tics that ensure that even his best solo albums fall short of classics.<br />The strengths:  mainly it's the melodies, the sense of experimentation and his bass line.  The album is White Album-ish. Lonely Road is a strong opening. Subsequent listens to 'From a Lover to a Friend' show it to be a beautiful melody.  'She's Given up Talking' is fun, experimental and one of the better tracks on the record, the treatment of the vocals especially (the story --think Maxwell Hammer's quiet sister without the violence).  The instrumentation on 'Heather' recalls Billy Joel's prelude to Angry Young Man (although not nearly as pounding, but a good instrumentation like ones found on the Mccartney album). &quot;Magic&quot; is a great listen -simple meaningful lyrics-- as are the rockers 'About You' and although it's five minutes too long &quot;Rinse the Raindrops.&quot;  Other highlights include the album's country-ish &quot;Your Way &quot;(a white album style song) and the title track, which shows you don't need great lyrics to have a good song. <br />Weaknesses: Well...typical of Macca he has a gift for writing a line that'll make you cringe and I mean cringe--&quot;culture bat&quot; from spinning on an axis&quot; and all the world's a tiny bubble -- bleech!! Couldn't he have at least tried? 'Your Loving Flame' is also insipid.  The words don't have to be too deep, in fact he's at his best when he tries to convey a message simply.  He gets into trouble when he starts trying to be too profound (tiny bubble, again) or writes words that even a fourth-grader would find derivative as to not mean a damn thing (Loving Flame).  As to where it falls in the Macca catalogue? It's hard to say..it's up there.  If you like him, as I do, you'll like it.  Still, if one of those guys in his new band could have said &quot;Paul -- What do you think John would sayabout the culture bat line or this tiny bubble stuff?&quot; We all would have been better off and maybe even have that classic.
B00003CXRM|5.0|I just popped into a theater to kill some time and this is what happened to be playing at the right time. I had never heard about the flim. It was great, funny keeped your attention and I loved the music. I would recommend it for the whole family.
B00005R2M3|1.0|The English songs on this CD are just plain mediocre compared to the brilliant, original and exciting Spanish songs on Donde Estan los Ladrones. Shakira &quot;succeeds&quot; (if you want to call it that) in making herself sound like just another American female pop singer, and her lyrics in English are decidedly on the mundane side. The wonderful voice heard on Ladrones is here buried by the raucous instrumentation. If you loved the full, rich Latin sound of Ladrones, then you are in for a severe disappointment here.
B00004R9A4|4.0|Not as good as &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, but still a great Disney musical. The film's basic story is about a witch taking a correspondence course in witch craft, but when the course is canceled, she searches for &quot;the professor&quot; in hopes of obtaining the remaining piece of a spell that she needs.<br />The best part of the movie is the Soccer game, where animated creatures are mixed in with live action. Many of the songs are great to, and also mix animation in with the live actors at times. Like the number that took place on the bottom of the sea, where the actors mingle with fish and other sea creatures.<br />The DVD contains two classic animated shorts starring Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse.

People even came up to me at the theaters telling me to go see it, I went up to people and told them about it!  I have never seen a movie with such good cam work, sound, color, music!!!!!!<BR>And the love story!!!  All I can say is, watch it for yourself.
0800177975|5.0|This movie is one of my favorites.  The thing is it's billed as kind of a fantasy/action movie but in my opinion it's a satire on the level of Scream, The Naked Gun, or Spinal Tap.  Like in horror movies, there are certain must haves in action movies:  vehicles spontaneously bursting into flame, ridiculous car chases, and no matter how many guns the bad guys have they couldn't hit water if they fell out of a boat.  <br />&quot;Dehre's alwahs ah guy in dere.&quot;

B00005QK3W|2.0|Boring unfinished songs, too artsy for this McCartney fan.  Musicians are amatures compared to the ones he has worked with in the past.  Songs lack arrangments.  Not his worst but not in my McCartney top 10 list that's for sure.
0440403545|5.0|I love this book!!!!  It's just as good as the first one.  My sixteen-year-old older sister kept this treasured book in her shelf and urged me constantly to read it.  I brushed her off saying that I didn't have time and that it looked boring.  One day, I had nothing to  do so i picked up the well worn book and began reading.  Surprise!  I couldn't put it down.  Not because it was exciting or suspenceful, but simply because it's one of those feel-good, sweet and uplifting books.  On first examanation it doesn't seem deep or like it would have something important to teach, but after a closer look you find what a beautiful message it has to share.  A girl, who with her kindness and ever cheerful outlook on her surprisingly hard life, make her a role model for any one.  This is a perfect book for any girl who likes a delightful story and a sweet romance.  I aggree with the other reviewer about Aunt Polly.  She is quite exaperating, but the other wonderful charatures make up for it and she keeps it interesting.  So, get a cup of hot chocolate and snuggle down by a warm fire with this book and be prepared for a wonderful time!
0684867621|1.0|I like Stephen King.  But this book was a waste of my time and money.  I wanted to stop reading mid-way because it was so predicable what was going to happen at the end.  So many endless pages about the forest/wood. It just dragged, on and on.  I have to rate this at 1 star, because I have no other choice.  But is should be a -5 stars.
B00005NTNM|4.0|and it sure looks great on widescreen + it is all in its R rated glory as clint eastwood makes his 3rd film as dirty harry. he reluctantly teams up with a female partner (wonderfully played by tyne daly)as they try to wipe out a militia group terrorizing san francisco. see i use to see THE ENFORCER on TBS a gazillion times with the usual cuts for violence, sex and language.  this is the 1st time seeing it uncut and wow!  check out harry going undercover (as &quot;larry dickman&quot;) in a brothel searching for a female militia member.  it is more hilarious to what harry sees there that you didn't see in the tv version.  or the classic moment where harry hands his badge (he says &quot;7 point suppository&quot;) to his superior (angrily played by bradford dillman).  here, harry callahan may be dirty and doing unorthodox methods in fighting crime but he is smart &amp; knows what the hell he's doing while the higher ups, including the mayor, are a sorry bunch of losers.
B00005NGAK|3.0|The music and production are outstanding. However, they are ruined by the video portion. Whoever edited the video seemed to feel a need to show all the video editing gimmicks available. The camera is continuously panning in and out and jumping to different viewpoints. It rarely stays on a scene for more than a second; not leaving the viewer sufficient time take in what is going on. The result is a very frustrating experience.
B00005QATY|5.0|Music is almost never underestimated in movies today.  Just look at any current movie preview, and chances are you'll see a list of artists contributing to the soundtrack, usually popular bands and / or rap groups.  As appealing as these soundtracks sometimes are, especially to the &quot;teenage demographic,&quot; few of these top-sellers actually contribute anything to the storyline and plot movement.  In fact, hearing P Diddy or Smashmouth blare out some tune at a key moment in the movie is often more distracting than it is helpful.<br />That is what makes &quot;O Brother&quot; so special.  The soundtrack is simply phenomenal, and it blends so effortlessly with the rest of the film.  Some people refer to the movie as a musical, which it isn't; but I wouldn't mind seeing a musical with more of the same kind of music.  It is important to note that none of the music I'm referring to is &quot;background&quot; music-- instead, it is all sung by characters in one manner or another.  And the music alone would make the movie worth seeing, let alone the fabulous acting, which others have touched on nicely.<br />All in all, &quot;O Brother&quot; stands as a great flick, dedicated to entertaining us with sight AND sound.  Two thumbs up for the Coens.
B000002I2I|5.0|After a relatively rough year in 1969 the Doors attempted to make a comeback with their fifth LP Morrison Hotel.  Jim Morrsion had been causing problems at concerts and after exposing himself in a concert in Miami the group payed for it.  Lawsuits came flying at the Doors left and right and the situation nearly broke the band up.  However after all the red tape was cleared up Morrison promised to settle down and this allowed him and the rest of the band to concentrate<BR>on their next album Morrison Hotel.<br />Morrsion Hotel did not really sport any hit singles on the charts because the Doors were in exile at the time.  However it did have several underground hits such as the opening track ROADHOUSE BLUES which stated that the Doors had a brand new sound.  WAITING FOR THE SUN should have also been a huge hit on the charts.  The group mixed poetry with hard rock wonderfully here.  The only actual single relased off Morrison Hotel was the blues rocking YOU MAKE ME REAL and it only reached #50.  The medley of PEACE FROG and BLUE SUNDAY is very impressive also.  PEACE FROG discusses the political and social unrest of the 60's while in BLUE SUNDAY Morrison talks about his girl. SHIP OF FOOLS is another song were the Doors introduce their blues rock sound and LAND HO! is a catchy hard rock song.  THE SPY tends to be a bit of a boring blues sleeper.  QUEEN OF THE HIGHWAY is a song that brings out the hip attitude of the 60's while INDIAN SUMMER reflects the bands earlier work.  The final song MAGGIE McGILL proves the Doors were one of the greatest bar bands ever.<br />Despite the lack of singles success Morrison Hotel was none the less a huge hit.  Peaking at an impressive #4 on the billboard charts and becoming one of the best albums of 1970.  The album put the Doors back on track but Morrison's time was running out.  <br />Bottom Line Morrison Hotel should not be passed up.  In my opinion it ranks second only to the band's debut as the Doors best album.  Morrison soundsbetter than ever.  Krieger's guitar is amazing.  Densmore's drumming is awesome and Manzerek's keyboard playing is very impressive!  Highly recommended!
B000001ESJ|5.0|It's interesting to listen to Rush's albums in chronological order, and to hear how things had progressed from album to album. After hearing what had been created on Rush's 1976 breakthrough, _2112_, we could see the band perfecting what had been hinted at on earlier albums. And, here, on the effort that followed _2112_, we witness, yet another evolution.<br /><br />On 1977's _A Farewell To Kings_, we see Rush entering a more evolutionary period in their writing. To me, this album, in many ways, is a bit more pivotal than their previous album, in foreshadowing what the band would be famed for in albums like 1981's _Moving Pictures_. For instance, in *sound* value alone, the sounds that are found here are much more akin to what you would hear on the later-era, more accessible, streamlined prog-rock in their early-80s period. Also, the instrumentation, and how it is treated is important: it was on *this* album where Rush started to employ more exotic instruments into their repetoire, and in drove-like fashion: tubular bells, wind chimes, bass pedal synthesizers, orchestra bells; these types of airy instruments and sounds were fairly prominent in the _Permanent Waves_-era Rush. And, also as important, it was on *this* album, where Rush started to delve heavily into the use of odd time signatures, and the multiple use of them. To be precise, on Rush's second album, 1975's _Fly By Night_ (their first with Neil Peart), the band did start doodling around with odd time signatures, but not to the extent of which they are used here (and on later albums.) _2112_ didn't exhibit a large use of odd time signatures, so these things alone would leave you convinced of two things: (1). This album was *indeed* a big evolution from _2112_. (2). This album is indeed *more* important than _2112_ in establishing the Rush sound of the future.<br /><br />The title track starts off with Alex Lifeson's wonderful classical guitar, which indeed features classically-inclined progressions. Even within this classical guitar-filled section, we are already treated to multiple time signature changes. It then explodes into an electric section, which again, exhibits some time changes, mainly from a rhythm in 4 (common time), to a rhythm in 7. At 11 minutes, \\"Xanadu\\" was my first favorite Rush extended piece and still remains so. It features poetic lyrics (based on an actual poem) along with lulling chimes, synths and Alex Lifeson's guitar producing a synth-like effect. This is one of the dreamiest, romantic and seductive pieces Rush ever created, if not the most. The musicianship here is sublime: Geddy's seductive vocals and basslines, Alex's atmospheric guitar lines, and Neil's arsenal of percussives (and how he uses them) help to make this truly one of a kind. \\"Closer To The Heart\\" is the radio favorite, and needs no explanation. \\"Cinderella Man\\", is written by Geddy Lee. One of the more accessible pieces on the album, there is a groove that seems to run throughout the song. \\"Madrigal\\", is a dreamy, cosmic, absorbing mellow piece that prepares you for the insane, spiralling rollercoaster known as \\"Cygnus X-1\\".<br /><br />This song has to be heard to be believed, and is probably the singlemost intense song in Rush's catalog. If you want to hear Neil Peart at his most complex and mad, you have to hear this epic. Written in three movements, the musical insanity found here is seldom found anywhere else in Rush's catalog. The time changes are all over the place in this song; going from stuff like 7/4 (a mix of 3, plus a section in 4), while in sections like the opening of the third -- and last -- movement (following a tension building section), we are treated to a rhythm in a hard-charging 11/8, where the E (power) chord is (beautifully) pounded into violent submission, before switching to F#, then the time swtiches to 12/8. This particular motif is repeated one more time (only Neil Peart places the accent elsewhere; excellent as hell), in a manic, surging tension-releasing wall-of-sound, before Geddy Lee reaches what was probably the most violently shrieking wail in his career. The climax reached in this song is just as formidable and frightening as the \\"black-hole\\" which serves as the topic of this track. It's *really* intense stuff, and not for the faint-of-heart, but for those who, indeed, love a rush (pun most *definitely* intended.)<br /><br />Indeed, _A Farewell To Kings_ is an important album in Rush's catalog, and truly foreshadows the kind of things you would hear on subsequent albums: it is on *this* album, that you can see where the band was going on albums like 1978's _Hemispheres_, 1980's _Permanent Waves_ and 1981's _Moving Pictures_. You can hear a bit of this album in them all. _A Farewell To Kings_ is my personal favorite from these boys, and has an unique, cosmic charm not found on any of their other albums. It's highly recommended., before Geddy Lee reaches what was probably the most violently shrieking wail in his career.

B000002I2M|5.0|After the huge success of Morrison Hotel the Doors were back in the studio recording more blues rock tunes for their sixth LP LA Woman unfortunetly this recording would be the last Morrison would ever put vocals to. Despite the fact that it was not intended as a swan song LA Woman is none the less one of the Doors finest recordings. <br />The album is a blues album without a doubt and if you have only heard the Doors excellent debut or Strange Days then you'll be in for a bit of a suprise. The album of course carries several hits including the classic RIDERS ON THE STORM one of the Doors most memorable tunes. The title track LA WOMAN one of my favourite Doors tunes. The radio friendly hit LOVE HER MADLY another great song. The awesome blues jam THE WASP(Texas Radio And The Big Beat) a tune with an awesome beat, love the chorus! Apart the hits the album also includes several of the Doors finest outings on record including the opening track THE CHANGELING awesome opener check out the guitar! L'AMERICA a very dark psychadelic song and HYACINTH HOUSE a very sweet unique tune. The blues is really shown on CRAWLING KING SNAKE, CAR HISS BY WINDOW and BEEN DOWN SO LONG. Unfortunetly none of these songs do much for me CRAWLING KING SNAKE and CAR HISS BY WINDOW are boring sleepers. BEEN DOWN SO LONG is okay and even a  little catchy but it is very repetitive.<br />However these weak spots do not keep LA Woman from being a classic. I would rank this my third favourite Doors album. In conclusion... get this album! You will not be disappointed I wasn't. Each band member put in awesome musical input especially Manzerek and his awesome keyboard playing. Too bad Morrison died after this album was released! The Doors were just getting really good! And I Dug Their Blues Rock! Highly recommended!
B000001ESP|5.0|Rush's most popular album along with 1980's _Permanent Waves_, is a perfect balance between Rush's longer art rock epics (e.g. \\"Hemispheres\\") and shorter, yet complex songs (\\"Subdivisions\\".)<br /><br />There isn't much I can say about this album that hasn't already been said, so I'll just stick to commenting on each track:<br /><br />\\"Tom Sawyer\\"--The major hit off the album, and the one that received the most time on the radio. One of the few radio-friendly songs to feature such time signatures as 7/8 and 13/16. Not much else needs to be said. A very popular song.<br /><br />\\"Red Barchetta\\"--Another track which received some airplay (though nowhere near as much as the aforementioned track.) Alex Lifeson's trademark atmosphere-filled arpeggios are present.<br /><br />\\"YYZ\\"--Excellent fusionesque instrumental. Complex, yet catchy. Grooves in an astounding 10/8 (then switches to 4/4), and the boys exhibit their astounding chops: Alex's tasty riffing, Geddy's rich, funky bass tones, and of course, Neil Peart dazzles listeners with astounding fills, amongst other things. This is a nice serving of rock, jazz, new wave and reggae. Listeners can appreciate this along with the usual musician crowd.<br /><br />\\"Limelight\\"--The other big hit of the album, and deservedly so. Neil Peart crafts some of his best lyrics here, and the musicianship is tasteful, melodic and energetic. This song features latent time signature changes as well.<br /><br />\\"The Camera Eye\\"--My absolute favorite on here. Rush's last 10+ minute epic is divided into two halves. A definite artistic portrait of what it's like to be in the cities of New York and London. Rock for the architect, artist or anyone with imagination. This song is pleasantly overloaded with the spatial atmosphere that many have come to expect from Rush. The musicianship is melodic and golden, and Geddy Lee gives one of his most beautiful vocal performances. This epic is sublime.<br /><br />\\"Witch Hunt\\"--A dark, gloomy song about racism, and the ever-present ignorance which seems to plague society. Foreboding, heavy guitar textures pervade the first half of the song, only for them to give way to synthesizer sweeps that are the equivalent of orchestral soundscapes. This is an excellent track.<br /><br />\\"Vital Signs\\"--Rush doing reggae rock. And they do it well. Listen to Alex's guitar textures, the synths and the bass, and how well they are integrated into the whole mix.<br /><br />_Moving Pictures_ is regarded as a classic for a reason. If you're new to Rush, this, or 1980's _Permanent Waves_ serve as perfect introductions to this wonderful band. Highly recommended.e society.

B00005QIPH|4.0|If you don't like the basic sound of this band, you're not going to like the album. Every song sounds pretty much the same. But I like that basic sound, so I like the album. I don't know why, though, the fuzz effect is on the vocal on every song. It's obviously to sound &quot;garage,&quot; but I would have preferred more clarity on the vocal sound. And I tend to like bands with variety, so I really hope the Strokes evolve into having different type sounds on one album (the shining example of such variety is, of course, the Beatles). And I really think some background vocals and harmonies in spots would really add to the music. If memory serves, all the songs have just Casablancas singing lead, with no other vocals blending in. Endless comparisons have been made to the Velvet Underground, but for a reason. If you like the VU (especially their song &quot;I'm Waiting for the Man&quot;) you'll likely like the Strokes.

0792844793|5.0|David Lynch's at once quirky and psychotic film making style is perfectly suited for the innocence vs. corruption dynamic that is this movie's theme. This is often considered Lynch's masterpiece and despite its undeniable weirdness, is mostly praised by critics, with the glaring ommission of Roger Ebert, who dismissed it on a strange moral ground. He found the mix of abused, naked women and jokey satire offensive. Rumor has it that Lynch wanted to film this in black and white at first, which, in my opinion, would have been a terrible mistake and obscured the light-dark parallel. Lynch's use of color is well done, and pleases the eye. Maltin was right about the necessity of seeing this in a widescreen format as well -- it really comes through in the spacious apartment scenes.  The performance of Dennis Hopper in this film is outstanding, ludicrous, and hillarious (depending on your sense of humor). Oxygen-toting, obscenity-spewing Frank Booth gave me newfound respect for an actor that I found just irritating in the past. Great film.
B00003CXMG|4.0|If you like 70's era rock and roll this is the movie for you. If you are simply a &quot;good movie fan&quot; this will also be a great watch.<br />Cameron Crowe makes movies that seem to blend between the visuals and the soundtrack to help tell the story. This is no exception to his usual brilliance.<br />Please give this one a shot. You won't be disappointed.
B000050HTO|4.0|An essential purpose but Bob is defenately not just a greatest hits artist. If you like Dylan then you need to get a lot more then just this 1 cd. He has so many great songs and I really believe that better songs could be represented on this 2 disc package. 5 of the songs (...). Silvio and jokermen? I know Columbia is trying to cover all the years but I those 2 songs are my least fav Dylan songs.  Though does a good job of covering his career on through 99'. Contains good linear notes though.   <br />Peace out to all my freak out friends!
B000002TYK|5.0|Dave Grohl!  The drummer from Nirvana has his own band!?!   Yes he does, and this album isn't exactly recorded from a band, it's all Dave.  And it's all good.  I used to compare Foo Fighters with Nirvana, but after hearing all the Foo Songs, it's useless.   There two different bands, and you would love both bands even if you didn't know the connection.  I read in another review here that the reviewer thinks Kurt would be proud of Dave.  Well don't be so sure about that.  Maybe he might be proud of him, but from what people know about Kurt, he hates this kind of Pop Rock music.  And yes this is Pop Rock.  Maybe not every song.  But I think Kurt might be ticked that Dave would write music like this.   Foo's and Nirvana make different styles of music.  But wait!   For all of you Heavy and Grunge fanatics out there, this is actual GOOD Pop Rock.  And it's Dave!  I mean come on?  You have to love this music.  This is a very strong album, although not there best as I believe Dave matured and made a great album in &quot;The Color and The Shape&quot;.  But don't let that make you not get this album.  It has a lot of strong tracks, including my favoritist (LOL) Foo song of all time &quot;I'll Stick Around&quot;.   It just builds and builds and the end is great.  You just have to hear it.  Dave played and wrote all the tracks on the album, and it shows in the drumming.  So get this album and the other three out at this moment (11-16-01).  How can you not get this??  ITS DAVE!
0920668372|1.0|Wow! This is just about the creepiest kid's book I've ever read. It is especially disturbing that it has obviously been produced with such earnestness and sincerity. I especially agree with the other reviewer who stated that there is no middle ground with this book that I've ever heard of. You either LOVE it, or are very creeped out by it...<br />I'm sorry gals, but a mother sneaking into her grown son's house and crawling across the floor in a darkened room sounds more like stalking, than unconditional love.<br />I have read it a few times to my daughter and she likes it good enough. Of course, she is a kid, she likes EVERYTHING I read to her. Seen through her eyes, it is just a story. She doesn't have enough life experience to get creeped out by it like me and my wife do.<br />(shiver...)

Paul sounds great on it,<BR>especially towards the end when he shows us he can still really belt it<BR>out.<br />From a Lover to a Friend:<BR>When I first heard it, I wasn't sure I liked it, but now this song is<BR>really starting to grow on me.  It sounds very heartfelt, very touching<BR>and emotional.  It is both sad and hopeful at the same time. <br />She's Given Up Talking:<BR>Ah, now here is a song I truly despised at first.  Just sounded so...<BR>weird. Over a couple of listen, I started to warm up to it, and the lyrics in fact got stuck in my head.  It has an eerie quality to it, and is very unlike any other McCartney song I have ever heard.  I really like it now, and it is good to see McCartney is not<BR>opposed to experimenting, with songs that is.<br />Driving Rain:<BR> Okay, here is one song that has become a hot topic to debate in other<BR>threads.  While it may not be considered among his more brilliant works,<BR>I think it is a very catchy tune, I got hooked after the first listen. <BR>Once again, I'm not saying it's a masterpiece or anything, I just think<BR>it's fun.  I enjoy it a lot, especially now that I really can take it<BR>with me to listen to while I go for a ride in the driving rain :)<br />I do:<BR>As its simple title implies, this is a simple little love song, and<BR>another that seems very heartfelt and emotional.  Listen to the lyrics,<BR>I think it is obviously about Linda, as it talks about how quickly you<BR>can lose someone, and how important it is to love them to the fullest<BR>while you can, because it will never come again.  A rather slow song<BR>somewhat on the depressing side, but I still consider it to be a good<BR>song.<br />Tiny Bubble:<BR>When it first started, I began to get worried, how long was Paul going<BR>to do those Ohh Ohhs, Yeah Yeahs, etc.  Luckily, they ended quickly and<BR>a<BR>really enjoyable song started, probably not among his cleverest lyrics<BR>ever,but very catchy.  It has sort of a Wings feel to it, especially<BR>towards the end.<br /> Magic:<BR>Another tribute to Linda, recalling the day that he first met Linda. <BR>It's not my favorite song on the disc, but a decent song, definitely not<BR>a<BR>throwaway.  Some may find the lyrics to be on the silly side, but after<BR>all, what's wrong with silly love songs :)<br />Your Way:<BR>Here is one that was an absolute instant favorite for me.  It is done in<BR>a sort of country style.  Has a definite Wings fell to this one, and<BR>even a mention of Venus and Mars.  The lyrics are fun to sing along<BR>with.  In my opinion, this song ties with Lonely Road as being the best<BR>track on the album.<br />Spinning on an Axis:<BR>Not being a fan of Rap/Hiphop, I shuttered a few times when I first<BR>heard this one, as it sounded a bit like it.  After listening to this<BR>one for a while, it did actually grow on me, so I now accept it, but it<BR>is not one of my favorites.<br />About You:<BR>I liked this track the first time I heard it.  This Ballad really rocks,<BR>probably the one of the &quot;rockingest&quot; songs on the disc, being beaten in<BR>that respect only by Rinse the Raindrops.<br />Heather:<BR>I really enjoy this mainly instrumental track, gets me feeling really<BR>upbeat and happy, nice tune.  Though the few lyrics aren't really great, they have grown on me.<br />Back in the Sunshine Again:<BR>This song is probably my least favorite on the CD.  Possibly due<BR>partially to the fact I am just not a fan of the style it was done in. <BR>Doesn't help that it is one of the longer songs either, probably would<BR>like it better if it was only a little over 2 minutes, instead of over<BR>four minutes.  Still, there have been a couple of times when I seem to<BR>have been in the &quot;right mood&quot; as I seemed to enjoy this song a bit more<BR>at those times.  So I will have to see if this song continues to grow on<BR>me.<br />Your Loving Flame:<BR>Very nice song, asothers have said, it probably should have been the<BR>single instead of From a Lover to a Friend.  A very nice ballad,<BR>probably the best of its time on this disc, possibly one of his best.<br />Riding into Jaipur:<BR>I like this one too, though it's best to think of it as another<BR>instrumental tracks.  The few lyrics in it are not that good at all in<BR>my opinion, but I do enjoy the special effects done to Paul's voice<BR>later in the track, seems to fit the music.  The Music is of course the<BR>India style music, and is quite catchy, though it does seem to drag on a<BR>bit to long.<br />Rinse the Raindrops:<BR>Pure Energy, Pure Fun!  This one really rocks. This 10 minute jam<BR>session, is only composed of a couple of verses, but Paul sings them<BR>different every time, and at the end is screaming out the words and even<BR>just plain screaming.  This song is a great way to end a great album.<br />Freedom:<BR>Of course as we have all known for sometime, Rinse the Rain Drops is no<BR>longer the one that ends the album.  Freedom, first done at the Concert<BR>for NY now is.  I do enjoy Freedom, I liked it at the concert, and I<BR>like it even better now that it has been remixed in the Studios.  This<BR>song, while its lyrics may not be the best, is very catchy, and for the<BR>most part very appropriate.  I think the single (which I purchased today<BR>(nov 14)) may have good shot of getting up there on the charts.

It is a superb example of film making, certainly among the 20 best movies I have ever seen. <br />Jack Nicholson is private detective Jake Gitties, who can be as hard-boiled as Humphrey Bogart's Phil Marlowe. But Gitties is different: He is intelligent, dresses well and has associates whom work with him. Gitties is hired by Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) to investigate into an extra-martial affair she believes her husband is having. However, the investigation leads into bigger things involving the water supply of Los Angeles, which is in the middle of a drought. A series of double-crosses, murders and plot twists all lead into a climatic showdown in Chinatown which has a surprising conclusion. <br />If the saying \\"They don't make them like they used to\\" was ever more true, it was with this movie. Sex is only suggested between the Nicholson and Dunaway characters, yet it is convincing enough. And although Faye Dunaway is a beautiful woman, we never see frontal nudity of her (Directors today would do just the opposite). Some of the plot twists also would not be possibly made today, especially the ending (Which, if you haven't seen the movie, I cannot reveal). <br />Nicholson is a tour de force in his role as Gitties, but the rest of the supporting cast (Including John Huston as Mulwray's deceptive father) is equally superb. As to how Nicholson could loose the Best Actor Oscar to Art Carney in Harry and Toto is beyond me. Faye Dunaway was also nominated for Best Actress, only to loose to Ellen Burstyn for Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore. Fortunately, Nicholson and Duanway have both won Oscars since. In addition, the film itself received nominations for Best Picture and Best Director for Roman Polanski (Who has a cameo in the movie as the knife-welding thug who cuts Nicholson's nose), but those Oscars would be lost to The Godfather, Part II. The only Oscar won was for Robert Towne's screenplay, which is today considered the model for film writing. After watching the movie, one will know why. From the stellar performances to the sharp direction to the superb screenplay, this is a cinema treasure.
B00005QG9J|4.0|I had mixed feelings about this record at first. Morning View is softer and has less nu-metal/funk than their previous efforts, I wasn't sure how I felt about Incubus' transformation. However, after giving it a few listens, I was hooked!!! This is a great CD, I am glad Incubus was brave enough to expand their musical horizons. Too many bands today just keep repeating the same thing over and over...and eventually burn out, but not Incubus they always bring something new. The only thing that worries me about MV is where this new style will take Incubus. Hopefully their records will not keep getting softer and softer, because I'll admit it, I am a head banger at heart! But whatever Incubus dose I am sure it will be great, I don't think that fans will ever be disappointed!!! <BR> Stand outs include:<br />Nice to know you- good tune, better lyrics, sounds like something from 'make yourself'<br />Just a phase- what can I say? great song....n'uff said<br />Warning- Warning: this song will get stuck in your head!!! good soft rock song, nice message<br />Echo- one of my fav's, it's basically a softer stellar
B00005OWIU|5.0|This CD was excellent! I loved all the music on it. (I haven't heard every track yet) It's easy to tell it's for kids because of the comical atomosphere it gives out. I loved &quot;The Quidditch Match&quot;.  It was very exciting and gave sense of danger. I can hear hints from &quot;Hook&quot; hidden in the notes, mostly it the quieter parts of the song. I liked &quot;The Face of Voldemort,&quot; a lot.  The theme for Voldemort is very creepy when it was played with the choir and strings in the first few seconds of the track, and the Prologue theme is played here and there. &quot;Leaving Hogwarts,&quot; introduces (As far as I know) a very good theme. The very end sounds very good, and shows that that is where the movie ends.<br />I loved the CD and hope that John Williams is assigned to score the other 6 Harry Potter movies!
B00003CXB2|5.0|This spectacular masterpiece by the widescreen maestro is incomparable. The images contained within this film are indeliable, when the phrase &quot;every frame a Rembrandt&quot; is used as the mantra for exceptional cinematography, this film is what they are talking about.<br />Every aspect of this film is epic - far too many to recite here - and the DVD chronicles it's lengthy, incredible production masterly. The presentation (sound &amp; video) is benchmark, and considering  that the film is close to 40 years old it looks as if it was shot yesterday. Large format cinema has sadly all but vanished from narrative film, but we can always look back this film in awe and wonder.<br />From Maurice Jarre's ethereal score and Robert Bolt's enigamic, yet involving characterization of Lawrence to the fantastic acting by O'Toole, Sharif, and Quinn and startling production design by John Box, one almost has to shed tears in light of the fact that we can no longer see films of this length, style, presentation and quality.<br />Yet it can live again on a HDTV through DVD, nostalgia is usually fairly dangerous when it comes to art, but you can make an exception for this film.
6304936303|3.0|Bruce Willis is in \\"Die Hard\\" mode on this one, the film has him as a private detective who appears washed up, he is soon contacted by his pal who has a case that he would rather Willis pursue, involving a stripper(Halle Berry)who might be involved in some shady dealings, his watchful eye attracts the attention of her boyfriend(Damon Wayans)who is suspicious of Willis, she is soon killed & they team up to find out who is behind it, this film is somewhat vulger in that it shows the worst in people, we learn that Willis was a highly decorated Secret Service Agent who foiled an assassination attempt that somehow ended his career, his assault on a senator that was beating a street walker didn't help either, Wayons was a football hero who was banned because of gambling, we learn these guys past & realize that were not always washed up. Critics say this film trashes women, are they watching the same movie? Willis comes home to discover his wife with his pal, although it does not respect women in some scenes, it does however convey Willis' love for his wife to a point of forgiveness, Wayons grief about the loss of Berry is seen with a tear in his eye, as they get closer they discover that the owner of the football team that Wayons played for is attempting to legalize gambling by attempting to bribe the senator that Willis had a run in with, their pursuit has the owner's stooge trying to taunt Willis in many funny & memorable scenes, the one-liners that Willis throws back is often typical Willis, there is a neat chase scene as well as the ultimate showdown between them & the owner that is quite satisfying, not to mention Willis & Milo(stooge), a great film for those seeking high octane action as well as Willis' sarcasm!
0790742780|5.0|When this movie was first released on the big screen, I read many reviews by professional reviewers that blasted it for its racial<br />  stereotypes and overall negativity. I had to go see what all the fuss was about, and I am so glad I did. I left the theater thinking this was<br />  one of the best movies I had ever seen, and my opinion has not changed to this day. And to the professional reviewer whose review (above) says 'what's the point?', I respond with: Since when does a movie have to have a 'point' to be worthwhile? Does every movie have to make some kind of political statement for it to be worth anything? Besides, I think this movie makes several points; you just have to be paying attention and be willing to look deeper than what you're accustomed to.<br />  First off, the movie would not work without the<br />  stereotypes. They are essential to our view on how Michael Douglas' character sees the world he lives in. The movie is violent, negative,<br />  and very sad, but that atmosphere is offset by a sense of humor that is worked in brilliantly. I got the impression that the writer and<br />  director did not compromise their message in any way, and thus I am surprised that this film actually got made in these days of political<br />  correctness. Bottom-line: This movie is not about politics or race or good vs. evil. It is simply the tragic story about one typical man and<br />  his inevitable fall into obscurity. I think we can all relate to his sadness more than we admit.

B00000AF95|5.0|Album #19 from KISS, Animalize, is definitely their heaviest.  Neither Creatures Of The Night nor Revenge have anything on this metal master work from a line-up that sadly, only lasted on this album alone.<br />From the first, Mark St. John's ferocious, no compromise guitar assaults the audial senses with &quot;I've Had Enough (Into The Fire)&quot;, and with the first verses sung by Paul Stanley, I knew this was going to be the ne plus ultra of KISS the year I got into them.  That was back in 1989, five years before this album was released, and eleven years have not dimmed the vitality of this classic album an iota!  It's albums like this that bring to mind the phrase, &quot;metal up your a**&quot;.<br />Just when the listener thinks he/she can take a breath, &quot;Heaven's On Fire&quot; comes on and takes the listener to metal heaven.  That epitome of what KISS is about is followed by &quot;Burn Bitch Burn,&quot; equally uncompromising, especially as this is Gene Simmons' first song on Animalize.  put your log in your fireplace&quot; needs no further interpretation.<br />&quot;Get All You Can Take&quot; is one of those songs that embodies the KISS philosophy--work hard, so play hard, which they most definitely do.  Or did.<br />Not all the songs have the ferocity of the first three songs.  The mid-paced &quot;Lonely Is The Hunter&quot;, for example, has a menacing undertone, thanks to Gene's vocals.  And &quot;Thrills Of The Night&quot;, about the double-life of a woman doing the usual 9-5 routine by day, and who knows what at night, was co-written by Jean Beauvoir, the mohawked African-American rocker who did &quot;Feel The Heat&quot; on the Cobra soundtrack.  However, let me say that there is absolutely NO filler on this album.  Period.<br />I will reiterate here that Mark St. John is what makes Animalize the classic it is.  That blistering guitar solo in &quot;I've Had Enough&quot; is evidence enough of that.<br />I read in a magazine that an hour before Paul Stanley was to take the master tapes of this album to the label, he changed his mind and remixed the entire album.  Brilliant move, Paul!<br />KISS's hardest album happens to be their best one.  The only things that I wonder now is, what would KISS have been like had Mark St. John recovered from his illness?

B000002UAO|5.0|With Rubber Soul, the Beatles started caring about making more meaningful music instead of songs that were chart-fodder.  On the other hand, anything by them that were released as singles were the creme de la creme during that time, so they were exceptional in that regard.  Well, songs like &quot;Drive My Car&quot; and &quot;I'm Looking Through You&quot; are the closest things to single material on Rubber Soul.<br />The &quot;ooh la la la&quot; chorus in &quot;You Won't See Me&quot; is something utilized by the Bangles in their song &quot;Complicated Girl&quot;, no doubt as a nod in their direction.<br />&quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; has the first appearance of a sitar, courtesy of George.  It sets the stage for John's introspective side.<br />There are some more introspective songs on this album such as &quot;In My Life&quot; and &quot;Nowhere Man&quot;.  &quot;Nowhere Man&quot;, which ended up as the theme song of the self-involved Jeremy in the Yellow Submarine movie, is another personal favorite, &quot;Living in his nowhere land/Making all his nowhere plans for nobody.&quot;  Yes, I guess that's where I live most of the time.  And &quot;Doesn't have a point of view/Knows not where he's going to/Isn't he a bit like you and me&quot; does fit me like a warm cloak.<br />&quot;In My Life&quot; has a reflective wistful melody well matched with its trip down memory lane lyrics.  George Martin's piano solo adds to the aura of contemplation.  This was covered by at least two other artists:  Rod Stewart on Every Beat Of My Heart and Sean Connery(!) on the George Martin tribute.<br />Paul's best song here is &quot;Michelle&quot; and his vocal is at its best here, with harmony accompaniments by John and George.  It has a simple message but a sweet one.<br />George has a pair of winners here.  &quot;Think For Yourself&quot; is the song the Beatles sang a snatch of to revive the Lord Mayor in Yellow Submarine.  Paul contributes a good fuzz bass in this song.  &quot;If I Needed Someone&quot; seems to reflect in part to the hectic schedule that was pushing the Beatles to burnout.  The lines &quot;if I had some more time to spend/then I guess I'd be with you, my friend/if I needed someone&quot; points to that.<br />&quot;The Word&quot; shows that two years before the Summer of Love, the Beatles had already proclaimed that &quot;the word is love&quot;.<br />A final note:  the tour for this album was the last they would ever do.  Bigger doors were flung open for Revolver, Sgt Peppers, and the rest.omeone&quot; seems to reflect in part to the hectic schedule that was pushing the Beatles to burnout.

B00005R2M3|5.0|Shakira's Laundry Service:  Insert coins for full cycle and review of album.  Warning:  listening to this album will make you think, &quot;Mariah who?&quot; or &quot;Celine Dion?  Is that a Canadian aftershave?&quot;<br />&lt;&lt;Prerinse&gt;&gt;  Shakira Mebarak Ripoll's long-awaited English-language debut is well worth the wait, and is one of the most refreshing pop albums I've heard this year, much less a while.  I will say that she sings well in English, but I'm entranced by the way her native language silkily and smoothly rolls off her tongue and her vocal chords, as I first heard from Donde Estan Los Landrones?<br />&lt;&lt;Beginning cycle&gt;&gt;  The opening tango piano and accordion of the first song, &quot;Objection&quot; blasts into hard-driving Ricky Martinesque pop like &quot;Living Da Vida Loca&quot;.  The song even goes into a rap in the middle before going into a Blondie-style guitar.  It goes to show that not only has Debelah Morgan lost her monopoly on tango dance pop, but that it has been improved on by Shakira, who also does a Spanish version of this song, which as the last song, acts as bookends in conjunction with its English counterpart.  Perfect symmetry.<br />The pop stomp of &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot;'s chorus is a catchy delight.  She also has some pointed words to say to her lover:  &quot;Lucky that my breasts are small and humble/So you don't confuse them with mountains&quot;  Wow, good one, Shakira!  I've got no problem with small and humble.  And a previous line where her lips spill kisses like fountains makes her a real passionate woman.  &quot;Suerte&quot; is the Spanish version of this song and it's just as snappy.  And to keep with the symmetry, it's the penultimate song on Laundry Service.<br />&lt;&lt;Insert fabric softener here&gt;&gt; &quot;Rules&quot; has a snappy chorus and also Shakira's sense of values, of which I detect one-to-one loyalty and unity.<br />&lt;&lt;Rinse&gt;&gt; &quot;The One&quot; has rock power-ballad guitar and even a choral melody reminiscent of Damn Yankees' &quot;High Enough&quot;.  And speaking of rock, &quot;Fool&quot;, and &quot;Te Dejo Madrid&quot;, with its rocking guitar, are one of the reasons that differentiate Shakira from Selena.  Shakira incorporates rock in her music rather than straight pop like Selena or Thalia.  I hope that part of her never changes.<br />&lt;&lt;Final rinse&gt;&gt; Of the other Spanish songs, &quot;Te Dejo Madrid&quot; is a solid rocker, while Que Me Quedes Tu reminds me of mid-paced 80's rock.<br /> &quot;Ojos Asi&quot; was my favorite song from Donde Estan Los Landrones? with its hyper-infectious Arabic melodies and rhythm.  It's done here in English, &quot;Eyes Like Yours&quot;, and they compare favorably with the original.  I like the original just a teeny bit better, though.  By the way, Shakira is half-Lebanese/half-Colombian, so let's not let recent events prejudice the race-baiting touted by extreme elements, okay?  It was the exotic Middle Eastern style of this song that really turned me on in the first place, so it's important to open the mind as well as the ears on this song, which rivals &quot;Objection&quot; and &quot;Whenever, Wherever.&quot;<br />&lt;&lt;Spin and dry&gt;&gt;:  Shakira's singular voice is not totally smooth or silky.  There's a hardness in her voice that I like, much like the tartness in an apple.  I still can't compare it to anyone else I've heard.  Maybe a softer version of Toni Childs mixed with Jennifer Rush minus the octave range.  And as for her image, okay, so she's done the blonde and navel thing.  So what?

6300214753|5.0|Okay, so my title may have been corny, but the movie was so funny, my title doesn't matter. Is this not the best 80's teen movie? I mean, what teen does not dream of cutting school and driving a hot car around the city with their girlfriend/boyfriend and best friend, going to a baseball game, singing in a parade, and getting the best of your prinicpal (or your dog getting the best of him for that matter), and lots more? I may have been born in 1985, but I can totally appreciate the movie. And dont't you just love when Ferris (Matthew Broderick) dances to the &quot;I Dream of Jeanie&quot; theme song? Or how about when his sister falls for Charlie Sheen in the police station? I love the movie, I love Matthew, and watch it! It's totally worth it!
B00005Q66T|5.0|I absolutely love everything that Madonna has ever released, so this may be a slightly biased review of this cd.  I feel like Madonna has chosen to include some of her all time greatest work on this collection.  It is about time these songs got gathered into one cd for listening pleasure.<br />I'm glad that songs like &quot;Frozen,&quot; &quot;Erotica,&quot; and &quot;Music&quot; made it into the collection.  Really, I love all the songs that are here.  I would only ask for at least one original song (or even a hard to find B-side, like &quot;Has to Be&quot;).  I also was sad to see that &quot;Rain&quot; and &quot;American Pie&quot; didn't make the list of songs.<br />The best part of this cd is perhaps the booklet that comes with the cd.  It is full of small Madonna pictures--over a hundred different classic Madonna looks are presented.  That alone was worth the purchase.  Get this cd today. A+

B000000W5N|5.0|The Stones changed up on us here and recorded in Alabama.  The album had a whole new feel incorporating a more garage-band sound that included horns and a dose of blues.  Both the sound and the songs are top flight as I believe they hit their peak on this record.  Has always been my favorite even over Exile on Main Street or Let it Bleed.  Over the years this album has come to define for me what a rock and roll band is and how they should sound.  Certainly one of the very best rock albums of all time.
B00005N9CV|4.0|I went to the record store to buy new electronic music, and happened to listen to this CD at one of the listening booths.  I was captivated by Diana's voice and forgot about whatever CD I planned to buy.  <br />Favorite:  'Besame Mucho'.<br />This is the perfect CD to listen to while cooking dinner, or when sitting by the window watching the rain fall.
B000002H97|1.0|It's astounding how bad this is.  Contains possibly the worst song ever, NOTHING ELSE MATTERS.

B000005RHR|4.0|Maverick electronic genius, Richard D James' landmark album. Considered by many to be his best. But is it? Well  its certainly more accessible than a lot of his stuff and a record you could actually play at a party without at least  half the people going: &quot;what the +&amp;% is this????&quot;. And there are some great tunes, notably Xtal, a wonderful, breathy track that will have you drop everything you're doing and just listening (which means it's not really ambient, but nevermind), Delphium, which is the aural equivalent of going on holiday in Greece, and the flagship track, Tha, which is a long, subtle ambient masterpiece.<br />Unlike its successor SAW 2, this album is less of a cohesive album and more of a jumble of tracks and styles. The sound quality is at times patchy due to the primitive equipment used to master the songs (cassette tape, which means you also get that sexy analogue compression into the bargain!). The lack of sleeve information is also irritating, and suggests to me that Mr. James could put more effort into that area. But as I prefer listening to early Aphex stuff, this is more my cup of tea than Richard D James album, for example, or Come to Daddy. Highly recommended and the perfect introduction to this remarkable artist.
B00003CXRP|3.0|Tom Hanks is the primary reason this film works and why anyone would commit to watching a movie about a man who is stranded alone on an island for four years.  Hanks plays Chuck Noland, a Federal Express exec who is driven by time and efficiency which have no meaning once he's cast onto a remote tropical island.  <br />*** Chuck scratches the surface of insanity trying to eke out an existence.  He forages, he laps rain water puddled in leaves, and he spears fish.  It's pathetic, but each accomplishment in stone age living is poignant in its way.  His loneliness is hugely palpable throughout his ordeal.<br />*** For such a major studio production, it's amazing not to have the extravagant trappings of costuming, makeup, special effects, and stunts.  Dialogue virtually disappears once Hanks' character reaches the island, save for the one-sided exchanges he has with his sole companion -- a volleyball he names &quot;Wilson.&quot;  Even the musical score is held back for much of the movie, and when it does re-emerge, you realize you're back on more familiar territory after extreme deprivation.  <br />*** The film is fully realized but oddly unsatisfying.  There's an impersonal pall over the movie that the viewer can't quite shake.  However, the bonus disc interview by Charlie Rose with Tom Hanks is very winning.  Hanks is articulate, accessible, and extremely thoughtful as he talks about &quot;Cast Away,&quot; &quot;Private Ryan,&quot; and &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; (his HBO miniseries based on the Stephen Ambrose book).

0066620996|3.0|The other reviewers on this page have done a great job of summarizing the key takeaways of this book, so I won't repeat it.  Instead, I'll focus on some random thoughts I have about this book:<br />* Even though this book is 300+ pages long, only 217 pages of that is the actual &quot;research paper&quot;.  The other pages at the end contain appendices on footnotes, interview notes, research methodology and a list of companies and how each fared after the 4 elimination rounds leading up to the 11 good to great companies.  It also contains an epilogue with some Q&amp;A about the applicability and accuracy of the research results.<br />* The framework talked about in this book is a product of close scrutiny of empirical data, i.e. all the conclusions were derived by looking at the data.  In my opinion, the conclusions derived at by this book is only as good as the researchers that made them.  A lot of the concepts in this book are the result of heated arguments and debates (down to which chapter should be included and why).<br />* The book presents some interesting stories to stress its points, but some of them are flat out horrible analogies.  I'm impressed with Mr. Collins network of friends/acquaintances.  He tries to convince the reader that research based on companies can be applied to life in general as well.  He goes as far to provide the analogy of his wife giving up everything (work, career, time and money) to win the IronMan competition in Hawaii as an example of the Hedgehog Concept.  There's also a flimsy story of a football staff that he wants to use to show that going from good to great requires no more effort than remaining mediocre.<br />* I feel the author was pushing it in some areas of the last chapter where he talks about how Good to Great relates to Built to Last.  He comes up with this table with all the Built to Last concepts on the left column, and for each of those concepts he writes a sentence including all the concepts from Good to Great.  Itfelt so artificial.  It was evidently just a bunch of words strung together to convince the reader that both books mesh perfectly with one another.  Whereas I don't deny that indeed there might be a link between the two research studies, I don't believe he was convincing in explaining it.  Don't get me wrong.  I like the idea of Good to Great as a prequel to Built to Last.
B00005QK3W|4.0|Paul and I go way back. One of his better bands - I think it was called the Beatles - significantly shaped my musical tastes of the future ... certainly the case for millions, no?! I have always been right at home with Paul's unique, round, warmhearted vocals. Who can forget his voice at its best, both smooth-as-butter as well as rock-and-raspy? ... from Yesterday and I Will, to Helter Skelter and Oh Darling!<br />I've always appreciated Paul's willingness to bear his unending positive perspective of life. He's not afraid to fall in love and tell you about it.<br />If you are a lover of Paul, you will love his new album. It will be money well spent for all of you hard-working folks out there. His classic vocals and unique Paul-style (the album is filled with those contagious McCartney hooks) are on full display here. It's true that he's pared down considerably the production found on another recent great, &quot;Flaming Pie.&quot; It's evidently what he wanted, and he's pulled it off - as he usually does - with great success! A nice, often raw follow-up to that incredible, spirited rocker, &quot;Run Devil Run.&quot;<br />So, go listen ... stick on the headphones on some relaxing evening and enjoy ...<br />And, for a final note, I must comment on the seemingly unremarkable CD cover art. You'd think that Paul, with all his dough, could afford a better digital camera. All the photos are so fuzzy and unclear .... but wait, maybe that's it! Life for Paul has been particularly fuzzy of late. He, and we (especially these days) have been through quite a lot. One joyous season passing with great challenge into another. The product is humble, unassuming, often loving music from one of the greats of our era.<br />May Macca's spirit of survival, coarsing plainly through &quot;Driving Rain,&quot; bring you peace of heart and mind.<br />P.S. I admit - I do miss Linda's occasional backup vocals. Sometimes, on some songs, I can almost hear her back there.<br />Oh no, here come the men in the white coats ... gotta go.n in the white coats ... gotta go.
B00000AD94|5.0|Spock's Beard's first CD, &quot;The Light&quot; is one of the best examples of progresive rock I have ever heard, and anybody who doesn't think so needs to stop taking the music so seriously.  If the lyrics are not a new revelation in your life, then fine, listen to some great instrumentation played by people who know what they are doing (for a change).  Yes and Genesis are all well and good, but the lyrics they wrote are no more spectacular than these lyrics. Real prog fans who don't like this CD need to lighten up and stop looking for the 2nd messiah in their music.
B00005A1PR|5.0|Where have I been? After one listen to India Arie's: &quot;Acoustic Soul&quot; I realized this incredibly talented and positive ARTIST, was on her way to making significant MUSICAL IMPACT. India's lyrics are creatively crafted with VISION and HOPE. Nowhere is this more evident than in the celebratory anthem: &quot;Strength, Courage &amp; Wisdom&quot;. In addition to being a stunningly gifted guitarist, India has impressively honed her subtle, yet beautiful vocals. On the breath-taking: &quot;Ready For Love&quot; and &quot;Beautiful&quot;, she bring's &quot;chills&quot; to the spine with depth and passion. Other selections to look forward to: &quot;Brown Skin&quot; - (An ode to love and admiration), &quot;Back to the Middle&quot; - (A powerful message of life and prevail), &quot;Always In My Head&quot; - (Encoragement to never forget the one you've been blessed with), &quot;I See God In You&quot; - (A refreshing display of thankfulness), &quot;Simple&quot; - (Joyfully grateful) and &quot;Video&quot;- (A shining dedication to self). &quot;Acoustic Soul&quot; is a soothing journey for the heart and mind. Let's hope the future of India Arie will bring with it, a continued admonishment of healing artistry.
B00003CXXI|5.0|This movie had me laughing most of the way through it. Eddie Murphy is a real character as the taling donkey.  The movie has some adult inuendos in it but the littler ones will not even notice because of the rest of what is going on.  My granddaughter watched this 5 times in 2 days and she is only 5.  She just loved the movie, so I got one for her as well as for myself.  I say this is just about perfect for any child from 5 to 105.  It is great, can't wait to buy a DVD player because I know I will wear this tape out.
0671024256|5.0|I have spent many an evening editing student writing, and even more evenings reading whatever isn't nailed down, including some of King's many novels and stories.  What I most appreciate in his many gems of advice is the admonition that to be a writer, one must read a lot and write a lot.  Period.  No shortcuts.  Of course, he gives us much more than this, including his own rituals as a writer, along with examples of good and bad writing techniques.  Some of his biases kept me laughing out loud, as his frequent mention of his aversion to adverbs.  Others crystallized for me exactly *why* something in writing I have read grates on me--the overdone description comes to mind.  I knew those kinds of passages bugged me, but until I read his rationale using the example of his own book, CARRIE, I never really could explain it. Now I can.<br />Most striking to me is the fact that EVERYTHING he says to do or not do is EXACTLY the same advice I have learned and try to practice as a storyteller.  Cut out the unnecessary embellishment.  Don't worry about theme. Remember the characters and the story are what  matter, the rest will take care of itself.  The story chooses you, not the other way around.  Again and again, what he says writers need to do to write well is the same advice I've received from any number of storytelling coaches about what storytellers need to do to tell well.  Is it any wonder, then, that King's novels and stories continue to satisfy his readers?<br />Along with the practical stuff, I very much enjoyed getting to know Mr. King as a person, with his often funny and self-deprecating view of himself and his life.  One might at first wonder what the autiobiographical stories have to do with writing, but they reveal the forces that made him a writer.<br />ON WRITING really is a wonderful look at what it takes to become a writer.<br />(This review has been edited to remove occurences of unnecessary adverbs!)
B00005QK3W|1.0|(...) Flaming Pie was weak, and Drivng Rain is simply horrible.  (...) McCartney would probably do himself and his fans a favor by hiring Bernie Taupin to write him some reasonable lyrics since John isn't around to bale him out anymore.  But that would cost money, and Paul is a reknown cheapskate who would rather \\"let the words take care of themselves.\\"
B00005QIPH|4.0|History has shown that you can always count on a group of New York art fags to breathe new life into the music scene.  In the tradition of such great NY art fag bands as The Velvet Underground and Television, The Strokes have created a sound that is straight to the point. On &quot;Is This It?&quot;, The Strokes stick to that stripped down &quot;punk&quot; aesthetic: Not overly-produced or full of itselt. This album is as good as it is because the songs are well composed and performed...That's all you can ask.
B00005OAIE|4.0|Ricky Wright does a great job at completely missing the point regarding John Mayer's cd.  My only guess is that Ricky and John were vying for the same record deal, but they only had one left.  The contract will always go to the talent not the critic.  It's a shame that Amazon has this misguided review representing what is a very balanced album.  With each song more than listenable, Room For Squares qualifies as one of those rare albums where you can put it in and not have to man the skip button.  The lyrics &quot;Angry Ricky&quot; described as unbelievable, most see as relatable.  And the music, God forbid, is catchy.  Since when did it become a music crime for songs to be pleasant to the ear?  Never in my book.  This cd is guaranteed enjoyment.  I promise.
B000002N2N|5.0|The greatest live album of all time!  &quot;Its Alive&quot; is The Ramones at their best.  It's 73 minutes of non-stop wall to wall sound. There is very little, if any, dead air space between songs.  The Ramones machine gun through a set of 31 songs without ever stopping to reload.  Loud, agressive, sharp, raw...just like it was meant to be.  These guys invented &quot;punk&quot;, but in doing so, set the bar so high, no other band has ever been able to reach it.  This album is more representative of &quot;who&quot; and &quot;what&quot; The Ramones are than any other of their albums. If you don't have it...Get it.
B00005R2M3|5.0|Amazing cd, I went to lots of stores trying to buy it and it was sold out, so your best bet is amazon.com.  I am amazed by her lyrics and her style, no other latin singer can write, dance and perform like Shakira.  I really like &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot;, &quot;Ready For The Good Times&quot; and &quot;Que Me Quedes Tu&quot;.  The entire cd is worth it.  You go girl!
B00005K9LN|5.0|The year was 1980, and Priest had just released the absolutely awesome live album Unleashed in the East a year earlier. Following up successfully to a record that so perfectly captured the energy of their live performances would be hard to follow.<br />But Priest did it!<br />British Steel rocks from start to finish. Look up, down, sideways, diagonally, behind you, whatever and wherever, but you won't find a single poor track on this CD*. Yes, it's THAT good. It opens with a roar with the the proto-speed metal anthem &quot;Rapid Fire&quot; and segues perfectly into &quot;Metal Gods&quot;, which although not one of my favorites, is still a good song. From there, the albums takes you to one of Priest's most well known songs, the all time metal clasic &quot;Breaking the Law.&quot; Next, we head to my favorite song: &quot;Grinder&quot;! The stadium anthem &quot;United&quot; follows... I don't think I need to comment on everything else: it ALL rocks. Well... alright, I'll mention one more: &quot;Red, White, &amp; Blue&quot; simply rocks! This is definitely one of those stadium rockers that you can wave your lighters to, and it even has fake audience applause at the end! Awesome song!<br />Now, the sound quality. This is a remaster, right? Thus, it should have better sound, right? Right. And I'm happy to say that for once, I can at long last listen to a CD that bears Astley's name for remastering. You see, I normally despise Astley's work due to his propensity to use noise reduction, which may reduce the noise, but also reduces the higher frequencies, ultimately causing the mix to sound flat, and if not flat, it leaves strange sounds in the background. So, Astley remastered this, too. But, I swear to God (and I'm atheist) that he didn't use noise reduction this time... this remaster sounds SUPERB, compared to Screaming For Vengeance, for instance.<br />You can't go wrong with British Steel. You can't. You just can't. It'll be well worth the ten clams or so to own this metal masterpiece.<br />5 stars for the music + 5 stars for the sound quality = 5 star average!
B00005JKHP|4.0|Whereas most 'true' sci-fi fans call this &quot;The Motionless Picture&quot;, the idea behind Star Trek: The Motion Picture is not action, it's drama. Surprisingly I find that several edits of this new edition actually have lessened the tension that was present in the original (IE, the scene immediately after viewing the digitization of communications station where Kirk barks out a repeated command to turn off the viewer).<br />Nonetheless, the updated special effects are very good, the remixed sound is excellent, and the movie does seem to &quot;speed up&quot; a little bit. This widescreen version is definitely an improvement over the old pan &amp; scan version I had before; the placement of characters seems to improve the atmosphere quite a bit. Also the shots of the engineering section seem to have more depth &amp; immersion than before. <br />I can't really say the extras on the second disc were really worth a whole lot. While the transitions and menus were nicely thought out, the extras seemed to be an afterthought. The director / production crew commentary was not extremely exciting to listen to. It would have been far more interesting to have the cast in on this commentary as well (but apparently they had problems securing the cast for this DVD -- which I think is a shame, they should have waited them out).<br />Overall though, this is a great movie to spend in a dark, dark room. Clear your mind of those sci-fi movies that solve everything with blasters &amp; torpedoes.<br />&quot;The Human Adventure is Just Beginning.&quot; A magnificent optimistic statement, attached to a very solid piece of sci-fi film.<br />Video: B+  Audio: A  Extras: B  Movie: B+  Overall: B+

B00005QB9A|5.0|I first had the pleasure of viewing this movie in Italy 3 years ago and I have been trying to find it ever since. After 3 years it is finally available so I encourage you to take advantage of this obviously overlooked movie and watch this rare gem. This movie is a must for anyone who loves the piano.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Let me first start out by prefacing what I have to say with: this is a movie that either you will love or you will hate. If you go into it with the understanding that you are going to see a musical, your appreciation for what it is might increase. <br />Baz Lurhman does a wonderful job at not just forming the world in which this story takes place, but developing the atmosphere surrounding the story.<br />The story is what many people might consider basic by today's standards. True, it doesn' t have crazy, often times dizzying twists and turns that many of today's modern stories have. It is a rather simplistic story, as were in many of the musicals of old that are loved such as &quot;Singing In The Rain.&quot;<br />The music, though not from the timeframe of the movie, compliments the storyline, which is what music in a musical is supposed to do. <br />The biggest misconception that people have about this film is that it is not like a lot of today's modern movies and love stories... and they are right. It isn't supposed to be. It is a musical story about one of our most basic, yet often complicated, and always prized emotions... love. It is a visually stunning masterpiece that incorperates all the positives of the musicals from the past, simple yet interesting storyline, good music, strong, multilayered characters, and adds in todays modern imagery, to create what should be hailed as a resounding sucess of a film.
B00005QK3W|5.0|A great, great departure, a near-complete 360 from FLAMING PIE (another classic) - it seems Paul McCartney has thoroughly absorbed the Super Furry Animals/Youth influence and (with the help of producer David Kahne) has released an engaging album full of raw, stripped down pop-tinged rock tunes and edgy love songs.  While he's usually a slave to melody, even the closest to a single on the album, \\"From A Lover to A Friend,\\" is structurally and sonically very loose (it almost sounds as if its falling apart, a brilliant emotional conceit to its lyrical content).<br /><br />Thematically, the songs all deal with yearning, loss, doubt, insecurity, etc., and the ghost of Linda can be sensed throughout.  Much like FLAMING PIE (and his other great albums, McCARTNEY, RAM, TUG OF WAR), he's dealing here with very immediate personal issues.  It's all very touching, poetic, and, yes, it rocks...and dig those crazy Casio Watch photos!
B000001ESN|5.0|Permanent Waves was my first Rush album and it remains, in my opinion, one of the three best if not the outright best.  Perhaps 'Moving Pictures' might edge it out for stylistic perfection, maybe 'Signals' evokes more imagry.  Like a politician's promises; these things waver and change from day to day so I don't worry too much about the absolute number one.<br />Regardless of what ranking I, or anyone else, might assign to 'Permanent Waves', the album is a nearly flawless piece of work by arguably the best group in progressive rock.  From the striking cover art to the last song this is rock at its best. The bigger LP cover did the artwork more justice but after two decades of paranoia about scratches in the LP, the format CD is very nice.<br />More years ago than I care to remember I found myself sitting by my window on the 8th floor of a hotel in St. Paul watching snow fall in the evening and listening absently to the radio.  Suddenly the opening riff of 'Spirit of Radio' came through; instant connection, I loved it.  Naturally, the station didn't say who did the song and so over the next couple of days - humming a few bars, reciting a couple of lyrics - I asked around. It took longer than you'd imagine but I found someone who identified the song and the artists.  The album (they were LPs back then) was mine by sunset.  Don't wait for the snow, try not to even wait for sunset; it's that good.
6302293553|5.0|I must say, I agree with Amazon's review of the film. I'd never even seen any of the sketches before I watched the Holy Grail and Life of Brian. Thank the heavens that this is NOT a rare film! With such quotable quotes as &quot;It's just a flesh wound&quot; and the ever remembered &quot;Ni!&quot; and the catchy &quot;Knights of the round table&quot; it's not hard to see why this was re-released. Stuck-up ninnies like Leonard Maltin who will stick to their classic black-and-white Bogarts will say things such as &quot;For fans&quot;. Leonard Maltin can go to Antarctica as a &quot;Penguin on the telly&quot; as far as I'm concerned. Don't listen to him. Listen to the EXPERTS at Amazon. Did they not put it under &quot;Essential Videos&quot;? Watch it! Buy it! Whatever! Just enjoy the thing! And if you could get me a shrubbery while you're at it, that would be nice.
B00005QIPH|5.0|Yeah sure,I'm as cynical as the rest of you guys.  In a society dominated by Rap-rock and Miss Spears, it's easy to be automatically suspicous when MTV actually plays something refreshing.  The Strokes have been labeled as the next VU, the future of rock n' roll, the second coming of Christ etc...  Don't don't buy into it.  This album is not spectacular, which is what makes it so (...) GOOD! The Strokes put out simple, no frills rock n' roll...something this country is badly in need of.  Since when did simplicity in rock n' roll become a bad thing?  Isn't everyone else tired of the same over-produced (...)? I am, which is why this record has been in my CD player(along with The White Stripes 'White Blood Cells')since its release.
6304078102|3.0|I'm not a Richard Dreyfus fan. I rooted for the shark, and was disappointed when the aliens came in peace, so you can see why I expected to hate Mr. Holland's Opus. <br />And in fact, this film is a two and a half hour parade of stereotypes equaled only by the seven dwarves. It's the thinking man's Forrest Gump, and the crowning achievement of screenwriter and cliché master Patrick Duncan. I rarely remember who said something first, but I can guarantee you Patrick Duncan said it last. Look for the shy student who learns self-confidence, the devoted wife who stands by her man, the dumb-but-honest kid who dies for his country, the small town kid with big city talent who risks everything for a shot at Broadway, the dedicated educators, the bureaucrats who stand in their way... lay the beans on your card and you can hit bingo before the denouement. <br />But wait.<br />I saw this film for just one reason: to see how badly they handled the Deaf character. In Hollywood, Deaf characters slide along a sorry continuum between the shy and melancholic, and the isolated and hostile, all symbolic, none bearing any similarity to any actual Deaf person I've ever met. Hearing people have no idea what Deaf people are actually like. The community of Deaf people in America is tight, it's vibrant, it's joyful, and every child born Deaf in America has this tremendous society just waiting to embrace it. But this isn't common knowledge among hearing America, who can only imagine themselves, suddenly cut off auditorily from the world they know, and so they project this onto characters they don't know, and create a sad stereotype with no basis whatsoever in reality.<br />Anyway, so I walked into Mr. Holland's Opus already composing in my head the nasty things I could say in a review, but lo, this film-- once I found a poison ivy ointment that actually worked, and the relief I felt when the itching immediately subsided, THAT is how I felt watching this film. The Deaf kid is funny, bright, fights with his parents, and likes cars and science. Among all the symboloids that cross this film, the Deaf kid is the only real, three dimensional person. That has a lot of bearing on the actual lives of actual Deaf people. <br />Since I was working as a sign language interpreter at the time, people kept asking me &quot;Have you seen Mr. Holland's Opus?&quot; and I'd say &quot;Yes,&quot; and then they'd say &quot;How realistic is it that this kid has a musician father? How many Deaf people have parents like Mr. Holland?&quot;<br />And I'd answer &quot;All of them.&quot;<br />Seriously. Take a guy who listens to news in his car, who doesn't own a CD player, tell him his child is Deaf, and suddenly he's weeping that junior will never hear the melodious strains of &quot;Mozart.&quot; He pronounces it to rhyme with &quot;Beaux arts.&quot;<br />So Glen Holland is the symbolic, universal parent-of-Deaf-child. This time around hearing people are the symbols, and the Deaf kid is the one who is real.<br />It's about time.
B00004T0UT|5.0|Elvis was 34 years old when he recorded this brilliant collection of pop, country, blues and soul music. It's an eclectic mix, and probably not to all tastes, but one thing is abundantly clear - Elvis was at his peak when he set foot in the American studios in Memphis that winter of 1969.<br />Vocally, this is a very different Elvis from even two years earlier, when he was still producing the sweet almost-crooning sound associated with soundtracks such as Blue Hawaii. Here his voice is stronger and darker, and the raucous opening track (Wearin' that loved on look) shows he is not afraid to sacrifice beauty of sound for a more dramatic effect. That's not to say this album doesn't contain some mellow singing as well - In the Ghetto is proof of that.<br />But what makes this album great is the sheer individuality displayed in every track as Elvis gives each song his trademark commitment and energy. Stand-outs for me include Only the Strong Survive, in which Elvis transforms an otherwise standard song into a very personal statement; a definitive Gentle on My Mind; After Loving You (with its brilliant vocal gyrations); Any Day Now; and the haunting and moving True Love Travels On A Gravel Road.<br />The bonus tracks include two songs that should have been on the original album - Suspicious Minds and Kentucky Rain. It's great to have them reunited with their companion pieces from the same recording sessions.<br />Just one tiny criticism - why has BMG included a photo of the Hollywood Elvis on its cover? It's precisely THAT Elvis that this album seeks to escape from! Perhaps they were being ironic?<br />The liner notes are excellent, and complement a masterful artistic statement from pop's greatest icon.
B000002UVX|4.0|It was almost symbolic that Band of Gypsys was recorded on New Years Eve 1969/70. Jimi Hendrix had recently discarded his power trio, the Jimi Hendrix Experience, and formed the Band of Gypsys with bass-player, Billy Cox and drummer, Buddy Miles. Whereas the Experience exemplified the grinding, baroque, psychedelic rock that largely defined the sixties, the Band of Gypsys exemplified the melodic, groove-heavy, socially and spiritually conscious funk that would largely define the seventies. This live album was the first Hendrix fans heard of the guitarist's new project. Most would not be disappointed. Hendrix's new style nicely sustains the absolutely wicked, inventive guitar-playing from which his reputation was born. His fluid, wavy, hypnotizing jamming scampers through the six tracks, becoming slightly overdone on the nine-minute \\"Who Knows\\" and the thirteen-minute \\"Machine Gun.\\" Still, small sections of unstructured noodling can not stop \\"Who Knows\\" from excellently setting the album's funky tone or \\"Machine Gun\\" from being one of the most intense, dramatic and stunning songs inspired by Vietnam (Only Hendrix had the ingenuity and skill to make his instrument screech like a battlefield). The two other Hendrix-penned tracks, the groove-rocker, \\"Power to Love\\" and the fervent \\"Message to Love\\" are two of his most spirit-inspiring works and nicely showcase the Gyspsys' rapid-fire arrangements. Buddy Miles does more than keep the band steady with his fast-paced trouncing, he also contributes two excellent foot-stompers, \\"Changes\\" and \\"We Gotta Live Together.\\" Miles himself would go on to become a star of the upcoming funk/soul movement. Hendrix, tragically, would not live to see it. The artist would die of asphyxiation shortly after Band of Gypsys was released. Sadly, for Hendrix, this funkrock showstopper was not a sign of things to come, but a passing of the torch.
B00000IFWE|5.0|Tom Petty always gets me with how much i can relate to the lyrics from his songs. i can always find a meaning in his stuff, unlike some of the other bands i like. it's a refreshing change, to be able to listen to someone and say, &quot;hey, he knows what i'm going through. he's been there.&quot; his folky songs have just enough rock in them to keep me listening. his voice is unlike any i have heard before. not beautiful, but exactly right for this type of music. Echo and Room at the Top are definitely beautiful. Counting on You is pretty much soft rock and extremely catchy.it amazes me that he has been around for thirty years and is still going strong. it must be great to have that kind of passion for what you do. by the time you listen to this album for the second time, you'll be singing along with his catchy lyrics. it's a great album, so sit back, relax and enjoy.
6304196784|4.0|This is what some might call a guilty pleasure. Not that it's badly acted or badly written. It's neither. The lines are snappy, the acting is great, and I think that Kevin Kline totally deserved his Oscar. But it is so DIRTY! Sex scene after sex scene. Yet somehow, every single one of them made me snigger, laugh, and once even gasp for breath from laughing so hard. John Cleese plays a barrister (He's well suited for the role) who is defending the boss of three jewel thieves, played very well by Kevin Kline, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Michael Palin. The boss is being arrested on charges of animal cruelty, of all things. The title comes from the name of Palin's character's favorite goldfish, Wanda. I won't reveal any more of the plot, partly because it's so complicated and partly because I'd ruin the whole thing. I'll just let you watch and see how it goes for yourself. If you don't mind watching the several slightly nasty scenes in this film, you'll definately enjoy it.
B000056K04|3.0|I must say, since I know the DMB, that this was not consistant to the usual Dave Matthews. With Glen Ballard taking the helm, you have a more pop-phile Dave Matthews. What I didn't like about this CD was the lack of use of the other instruments. Heck, Boyd Tinsley was almost totally non-existant in this album. We dont even hear much sax either. Here is a review for all the songs:<br />1. I Did It: The first song on the album, and really gets you into the CD rapidly. It is an alright song, havind Dave singing the cute \\"Guilty as Charged\\" lyrics.<br />2. When The World Ends: A rather steamy song, with lots of emotion in the love department, a place the band hasn't gone much before.<br />3. Space Between: Well, what can you say. Perhaps a little over-produced, but this song is the radio gem of this CD.<br />4. Dreams Of Our Fathers: Probably my least favorite song on the album, with Dave trying to win with bad lyrics. It is also too long.<br />5. So Right: Nothing wrong with it. Very strong lyrics(ala. \\"stay up and make some memories), and very instrumental, but Dave and those songs about love.<br />6. If I Had It All: A pure want to be. (...)P>7. What You Are: Ranks high on my list, it is one of the songs you hear Tinsley's violin in. Middle Eastern sounding make even more eerie.<br />8. Angel: Another on deck to be a hit. Sounds like a song for a boy band, not Matthews.<br />9. Fool To Think: Good Song. Good lyrics and the nice use of the sax. This is also in the running to be a hit.<br />10. Sleep To Dream Her: A nice soft song. Puts me to sleep at night, keeps me awake during the day. Saxaphone show up in this one.<br />11. Mother Father: This ranks low, and I mean low. Having Santana in it is bad enough, but the fact that it is a culrual mess is worse.<br />12. Everyday: My favorite. It goes back to the Matthews we all know, even if it was for a moment of this CD.<br />Not recommended for first timers, DMB fans proceed with caution
0385501560|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, but I do believe that you have to be a Fight Club fan to appreciate this book.  Like Fight Club, it is very dark, but very well written.  I read this book in one sitting and highly recommend it!
0064471837|4.0|This is a great book, but there's some parts a priest just wouldn't say &quot;yes&quot; to, namely the view of death and all the magic. Sabriel is an eighteen year young girl who is able to walk in Death, which is in the form of a river with nine gates you must pass through to reach the Great Beyond. She uses &quot;Charter Magic&quot; quite often, which is apparently the magic that binds her world together and prevents chaos. Other than that, the book is a must-read. Sabriel, after receiving a Dead messenger from her dead father, Abhorsen (there IS a reason that I capitalized &quot;dead&quot; and &quot;Abhorsen&quot;), goes on a quest to find her father and bring him back from Death. She gets through much peril to reach Abhorsen's House, where she hooks up with a Free Magic servant named Mogget, who is in the form of a cat. On the rest of her journey, she hooks up with a long-lost prince named Touchstone (so named by the sarcastic Mogget). She ends up, along with Touchstone and Mogget, having to defend her country from an evil Greater Dead named Kerrigor (that's Rogirek backwards with a variation; it's a long story). Will she succeed?Read the book and find out. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves fantasy/adventure/suspense combinations, or just anyone who loves to read (or can!).
B00005LMBK|2.0|When I heard &quot;Clint Eastwood,&quot; I was expecting to hear more from Del throughout the album.  There are only a few good tracks, like &quot;Tomorrow Never Comes&quot; and &quot;19-2000.&quot;  The other tracks are weird as hell.
B00005AUBA|5.0|I first heard this track in a small Indie record shop in Old Town Pasadena. My friend and I were checking out songs on the listening booth, and he took a look at Mogwai and listened to the first track off of &lt;I&gt;Rock Action&lt;/i&gt;. I could tell he was fairly impressed by it, and he wanted me to check it out. As I listened to it, I was greatly startled. Such peace started in the beginning of the song, followed by intense madness and white noise, and concluding peacefully. I was sold on that song alone. However, since it was my first encounter with Mogwai, I expected more of this style. However, I found the rest of the album to be destinctly different, but that wasn't a let down at all. Overall, I now enjoy the rest of the album immensly, and I take a copy of it pretty much whereever I go. The only was to desribe the 2nd track, &lt;I&gt;Take Me Somewhere Nice&lt;/i&gt;, is as another reviewer of this album puts it: Heart-tugging. The soft vocals simply grab at you; there's no way to describe it. Other such songs that my life could not be complete without are &lt;i&gt;Dial.Revenge&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Secret Pint&lt;/i&gt;. All in all...your Mogwai collection isn't complete without it. Additionally, once purchasing this album, you should also pick up a copy of the &lt;I&gt;My Father My King EP&lt;/i&gt;, which is a companion to &lt;I&gt;Rock Action&lt;/i&gt;.
0399226907|5.0|This book is great! In fact, all of his books are fantastic! Kids from 1-5 love this (I know because I worked with various ages in daycares). The picutres are colorful and fun to look at, as well as the wording is simple, but not too childish. Overall, this is just a classic, great book for kids!
B000002NBY|5.0|paul simon with this collection of classics has given us an album that attempted a fusion of several styles and ultimatley transcended all the individual genres to create and sustain a sound and feel that is brilliant,haunting,hopeful and simply masterful in its range of human emotion and experience. this is probably the most important album to come out of the 80's. the surreal yet vague urban familiarity of boy in the bubble,the warmth and heady travellin'spark of the title track,the magic and the muse of diamonds on the soles of her feet,the arty playfulness of you can call me al, the world spirit feel of myth of fingerprints..all bear testimony to this great man's penchant for strong lyrics of pristine beauty and his capacity to make love, loss and life intersect in nostalgic tones to define and capture identity in sudden flashes of moment and meaning. an amazing album, a genuine masterpiece, the kind of stuff for which we listen to music in the first place, to lean into the multi layered experience of the chaos of cultures, meanings and symbols. to make it grow into the texture of our lives and to breathe in and exhale it all in acts of complete, oceanic realization. too good, simply a classic in the fullest sense of the word..please buy this album and keep listening to it until you see the distant constellation of stars burn out and reappear again.
B00005QK3W|5.0|Without any question, &quot;Driving Rain&quot; brings all of Paul McCartney's prodigious talents into focus as they have not been since &quot;Abbey Road.&quot; This is not hyperbole. From the opening bass lines of &quot;Lonely Road&quot; through the anthemic closer &quot;Freedom&quot;, this collection of music showcases exactly why McCartney is the most exquisite bass player ever in rock, one of its most sophisticated songwriters, and certainly one of the most arresting singers in music today. In the past, Paul could wade into dripping sentimentality, or thematic silliness that seemed somehow unworthy of him. None of that is here. This is a genius in full possession of his powers pouring forth all he has to make an extraordinary statement about where he is righht now. And maybe that's just what the magic element is here. I can think of no record by him since his first solo effort that has come across so personally true to the source. Perhaps it is both the loss of Linda and the discovery of Heather that has combined to bring out of McCartney the very best he has to offer. <BR>His cadre of collaborators on this disc are spot on on every tune. Again, it hasn't been since the Beatles that Paul has played with such a tight and brilliantly savvy group of artists. His son is emerging as a songwriter too, and if Crosby and Raymond are any indication of how productive those collaborations can be, then the next generation of writers will be blessed with a worthy successor of the McCartney craft. And craft is extremely operative here. Be it the Indian themes of &quot;Riding to Jaipur&quot;, the blues of &quot;Back in the Sunshine again&quot; (a song all by itself worth the price of the CD), or the sheer melodic grace of &quot;Heather&quot; with its lyric twist at the end, what you have is an artist in full command of his writing powers and flexing them with such consummate skill that there is no doubt about why he is the genius of modern song.<BR>The Beatles got where they were on John's drive to become famous. They stayed where they were on Paul's musicality. The years after had their ups and downs for all four members, but beginning with &quot;Flowers In The Dirt&quot;, McCartney found a stride he had not had since his halcyon days. Throughout the 90's that evolved in glorious form, and this is his crowning acheivement as a solo artist. If you were to buy only 1 McCartney disc in your life, this is it. He is basking in his finest period these days with a brilliant album and as a caring humanitarian, and what an extraordinary valedictory Paul has delivered. Take your own advice......
B00005A1PR|5.0|ACOUSTIC SOUL introduces a new singer with a fresh voice and a fresh prospective.  Her voice is rich and clean enough not to need all the musical override and remix that have come to be acceptable in the popular music business.  In addition to clear and melodious pipes, India Arie sings the songs that today's woman should hear.  The tune, VIDEO, clears says that she doesn't look like the girls in the music video.  But more importantly, it says she's happy that she doesn't.  The songs show a high level of self-acceptance and self-celebration.  Her rendition of BROWN SKIN offers a kind of sensuality that makes you want to play that track over and over.  Then she gives gratitude and tribute to the musicians from which she has gathered her style.<BR>This CD offers active dance music and tremendous mood music.  It's truly well worth the purchase.
0446677450|4.0|Rich Dad, Poor Dad is a very well written thought provoking book on how to make it in today's business world.  Kiyosaki is a very good writer and teaches financial knowledge very well through the use of simple diagrams.  I thought it to be very interesting that a well educated person is not necesarrily the one who is going to make it in life.  You have to know how to make money work for you rather than work for money.  Kiyosaki provides clear and easy techniques with explanations on how to become more financially knowledgeable.  Best of all, you could implement all of these techniques tommorow!  Very interesting book.  Well written.
6300214826|3.0|After reading The Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad and watching this film, I have come to the conclusion that both have the same ideology.  And that's what matters!  The graphicals scense in Apocalypse Now are way more than I imagined, some how one imagines a more serene atmosphere when imagining the settings of books.  A-N is harsh in reality and awesome to begin dissecting HofD.  Read the book before you watch the movie!<br />-Joseph<BR>Santa Ana, CA USA
0767835255|3.0|This action blockbuster is a pretty fun romp. It's a little far stretched, but who says it can't be?. Director Wolfgang Petersen delivers a top notch, high octane action film that will definitley please any action film fan. Harrison Ford stars as the President Of The United States whose plane, Air Force One, is taken over in mid-air by russian terrorists. The always excellent Gary Oldman plays the lead villain, and he does it with complete scene stealing bravado. Glenn Close co-stars as the Vice President who tries to communicate with Oldman from Washington D.C. headquarters. We've seen this before, but this is a million times better than most action films that involve hostages and planes. The action is pretty high once it gets going, and the violence is all over the place. Ford is, once again, cinema's leading hero. He can be a space pirate, adventurous professor, or the President. He can make it work every time. Even if the script doesn't always hold up to his excellence. This is one of those. If you realize that this is just pure 100% adrenaline fun, then you will have a grand time watching this fun ride. Afterwards, you'll definitley be thinking 'Harrison For President!'.
B000002H97|5.0|This is the album with which Metallica entered the mainstream and determined how they would exists therein.  The album set the standard for metal music in the early 90s (ask Megadeth and Ozzy about that) and established a fan base to which metal had not previously had access.
B00005LOUS|3.0|I think the movie was pretty good. There were times when Jim Carrey got a little crude but that doesn't suprise me. This movie was definatly targeted to adults more than kids. People that had grown up with the movie. I don't think that they needed to have that whole love thing going on between the grinch and the girl but all in all I think it was a good movie. They were very accurate to the book. I was very impressed that they used all the same lines from the original one. I loved all the sets I think that if &quot;whoville&quot; was real that is what it would look like. I think its a good movie and I'll definatly add it to my collection.
0385505833|5.0|I hesitated reading it.  I liked the early 'classic' Grishams, but did not like the shift in genre with &quot;the Painted House&quot; and was appropriately cautious when approaching this book.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  Yes, it is a quick read.  Yes, the main character's last name is too obvious.  However, I could quickly sympathize with the main character's desire to just skip the commercial trappings of Christmas, just once!  It was cathartic to watch someone else swim against the tide of commercialism.  The plot twists were not expected at all (maybe I am just slow) but worked out nicely.  Was the ending a little smaltzy?  Sort of, but I still thought it was a good ending.  I rarely buy Grisham in hardcover, but I have added this one to my library of holiday books.  Maybe not the book to read on Christmas Eve by the fire, but give it a try before you start decorating, shopping and writing Christmas cards and you may just look at the frenzy with a fresh view.  Finally, be prepared to laugh.  The mental image evoked by a certain rooftop scene reduced me to tears.  I agree with another reviewer that this could very well be made into a movie and completely agree with Steve Martin as the main character!  Enjoy!!
6304169558|4.0|This 1996 blockbuster is full steam ahead adventure!. There's been many bashing remarks about there being no story at all. Well, with a movie like this, a decent plot is really not an important thing. I'm amazed at anybody going into this movie expecting it. Have they been to a movie like this before?. The plot, what there is of it, has a bunch of storm chasers, led by the always appealing Helen Hunt, are trying to get a machine they've created into a twister so they can research them and let people know when and where a twister will land. Helen's ex, Bill Paxton, shows up with his fiance(the always underrated Jami Gertz)and they get sucked into the adventure as well. The special effects are, of course, out of this world brilliant. They are the real stars of this film. It's the kind of movie that will have you on the edge of your seat with pure, heart pounding excitement. And, really, that's a good thing to have. A lot of people bash these kinds of movies for just being simple entertainment. What a horrible world this would be without films like this. Anywho, the actors, including the great Carey Elwes, Alan(Spin City)Ruck, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman, are all pretty decent. This is a wild ride that never stops!. Pure entertainment<BR>and nothing more. It doesn't need to be.
B00003CY0V|1.0|\\"Swordfish\\" is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. I went to see it because my stupid friend thought it looked cool(...). First of all, the plot is just one giant movie cliche: The computer genius having to hack in to the DOD while having a gun pointed at his head and getting oral pleasure at the same time, John Travolta randomly getting up in his convertible with huge guns and blasting people, gratuitous breast shots... By the time we got to the part where they make a getaway on the school bus, my friend next to me just kept repeating, \\"This is so bad. This is so bad.\\" When they got the helicopter to lift up the bus, I told myself they weren't really going to do something so stupid, but they did. The helicopter lifts up the bus???? And the end is almost worse. All in all, I hate this movie. I might actually get it though, just for a good laugh(...).
B00003CY0V|4.0|Well, it's no surprise that a majority of movie critics panned this movie.  Typical lines like, \\"This movie made absolutely no sense,\\" and \\"all style no substance\\" seemed to be the ones that were written most by critics.  But I find it all so tiresome, Swordfish is a good action movie.  It doesn't try and make some point on the culture or be realistic, it is an action movie and they are made for one thing and one thing alone, entertainment.  After so many boring action movies this year, Tomb Raider and Planet of the Apes come to mind.  It is refreshing to see a nice hyper-violent testosterone driven gunfire fest, that has some snappy dialogue and pretty decent performances.  I love the opening of this movie, Travolta's tirade about movies sucked me in immediately, it was well-written and rose above most other tripe that tries to make light of other movies.  No real need to go into the other characters, suffice it to say, misdirection seems to be the name of the game with this movie.  But I was thoroughly entertained the entire running time, and I can't say that about much these days.
B00005QDW5|1.0|How many times can record companies recycle this old material? I love the Floyd but it has to stop somewhere.  This release is just plain ridiculous.  A 20 year old live show of &quot;The Wall&quot; was last years cash cow.  DSOTM is still a top ten catalogue album. Why oh Why.  Welcome to the Machine, indeed. Shame on all you guys.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|This is one movie you wont want to miss . something for everyone , very good story with knights in armer , dragons . princes , and a very likable guy called shrek .The only way i would miss this movie is if i where in a coma . my family liked the movie from start to finish .We've watched it 7 times the first week and it gets better every time . You're DVD/VHS collection would not be complete with out Shrek . I give it two thumbs up ! 1 to 5 stars doesnt give Shrek Justice . I give it a complet 10 stars . believe me , Once you see it you'll feel the same way . No words cany really explain how good the movie is but if their had to be one word it would be GREAT .<BR>Dont miss this one .
B00000I3JM|5.0|On the next dark rainy night,put this on and hit repeat and you will forget the world.&quot;Heatwave&quot; is my favorite, the voice,the sounds, the haunting melodies on the entire album make it a must have for atmosphere lovers.......!
6305513406|1.0|Don't misunderstand me; I love the original Star Trek.  The episodes on this DVD are quite good, and I give them 5 stars.  Star Trek was the first non-idiotic sci-fi TV series, and paved the way for more sophisticated sci-fi television.<br />However, these Star Trek DVDs are an example of shameless profiteering.  There should be 6 episodes on each DVD, not 2.  There's only one reason to waste 70% of the space on each DVD; to get the cost/episode up.<br />I wish there was a way to rate an entire series on Amazon, because that's what I'm doing here.  There's no way I'm going to duplicate this review for the other 35+ Star Trek DVDs!<br />I don't want unnecessary clutter in my DVD library.  I want 15 DVDs of Star Trek episodes, not 40.  I want to buy them all at once, in a boxed set, not dribbled out slowly, a couple of episodes at a time.  I am extremely unhappy with how these episodes have been released, and will not purchase them until they pack the DVDs full, either with episodes, or GOOD extra material.
B00005QK3W|1.0|With a warmer production and better vocals, this could have been a half-good album. There are some decent songs here--about six by my count. But the production is so metallic and fussy, it's virtually unlistenable. And this is the first McCartney album with bad vocals. I know he thinks he's being bluesy but he merely sounds ragged and worn. He needs to care for his wonderful voice and not give into age. This CD is &quot;Back to the Egg&quot; and &quot;Press to Play&quot; all over again. At least, McCartney gave us the wonderful &quot;Flaming Pie&quot; and &quot;Run Devil Run&quot; in the past few years. And I still listen to &quot;Ram&quot; and &quot;McCartney.&quot; Here's hoping that next time he finds his way home again, takes a little time in writing the songs, and grabs back the production reins.
0385505833|5.0|As I began this book I found it amusing.  But as I read on the book became hilarious.  It was so refreshing to find a book that I didn't want to put down that had me laughing so hard at some points I couldn't see through the tears.  Grisham has written a totally different type of book and has proven he is without a doubt an excellent author, this time writing a book both entertaining and funny
0451203933|5.0|A superb read, as close to actual combat as the armchair warrior will ever get.  It's inspiring to know that our military has the smarts to embrace this book as a primer for many of our soldiers.  (Bowden himself half expected criticism and rejection.)  Probably it has assisted in our very effective military approach in Afghanistan.  Also very welcome is Bowden's lone attempt to explain the firefight from the Somali point of view--if for no other reason than it's just dumb not to put yourself in the shoes of the enemy.
B00005QIPH|5.0|There's not a song here than breaks the four-minute mark, and each is strong in its own right. It's very much ear candy, but with a tattered and frayed edge to make these tunes sound as though they've been unearthed from a bygone era. The big hair, faded jeans and sneakers may all be pretense, but can anybody deny that they have the sound down pat? Maybe they do sound like a novelty cover band belting out the Ramones, The Who, and other groups already mentioned. Like those aforementioned bands, there is an energy in the Strokes's music that is contagious. Raw, punkish and infused with great hooks and Julian Casablancas's ragged vocal style. &quot;Hard To Explain&quot;, &quot;The Modern Age&quot; and &quot;Someday&quot; are my personal picks, but there's no filler here. It's too soon to say whether they will be around in a few years time. The bottom line: this album just makes me feel great.
B000056K04|1.0|I hate to say this about one of my favorite bands, but the addition of Glen Ballard to the musical mix has eliminated the depth and emotion that I expect out of DMB. Even &quot;Space Between,&quot; by far the best song on the album, gets old quickly. I've never had a DMB song get old before, I'm in shock really. If you like DMB, make sure you listen to several songs off this album BEFORE purchasing it, otherwise your likely to end up selling it like I did...
B0000048V8|5.0|My four year old and I both LOVE this story. The story and the music just captivate you.  We watched it over and over again last year, and I can't wait to pull it out to watch this xmas.
068485015X|5.0|I'm the type that likes someone to solve my problems for me or I throw a lot of casharoo at my troubles, hoping it will all go away. When that fails I engage in frozen,with salt cuervo-therapy, or I call my $180.00 per hour rent-a-friend. I was a big believer in denial, affairs, self-medication and elaborate pity-partys. Then came the day I boosted the Peck-Man's ode to growing up from my ex-in-law's house. Golly, what a jolt! The Peckmeister laid it all out before me. I came to realize that duplicity, co-dependency and the general jitters we all have about life is best understood in the context of being an adult instead of the man-child I have been. Read this book if you are post-35 and still think that everyone else has the problem and not you.
B00005NWRS|5.0|I heard Ryan Adams &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; in a store and made excuses not to leave so I could listen to the whole thing.  It has become a constant in my life and I have turned many people into fans.  When I first listened to &quot;Gold&quot; I was taken back on how different the sound was.  How much more energy there was and even seemed like the focus was lost.  It didn't have the same over all feel like &quot;Heartbreaker&quot;.  Then a few listens went by.  Then I found myself wanting to hear songs I initially thought I wasn't in favor of.  Now the CD has become its title.  It works as well as it does BECAUSE it changes so often.  From the brilliant &quot;Nobody Girl&quot; to &quot;Sylvia Plath&quot; to &quot;Enemy Fire&quot;?  That is quite a change in sound, feel, texture and even the structure of his voice changes.  It truely is an incredible album.  It made me buy Whiskeytown's last album &quot;Pneumonia&quot;, the best album they ever released.
B00005R2M3|5.0|I've loved Shakira's music since i saw her on the Rosie Odonell show about a year an a half ago..<BR>I don't know spanish but still try and sing along, <BR>BUT NOW with Laundy Service i can sing along I even bought this cd at an expensive store (due to location) cuz it was the only one in town that had Laundry Service...I'm so happy I love her spanish and love to sing along with her english<BR>A pretty girl with a Brain and Talent Your BORN WITH IT unlike some who think they can get Talent through PACKAGING<br /> On her last album mly favorite song was Ojos Asi I was so Happy now i can sing along with it and really sing and know the words <BR>I really like Tango, and Rules, and of course Whenever, Wherever.

B000026258|5.0|I discovered Steve Reich through a book on Philip Glass.  I came on-line and bought this piece as an introduction.  On my first listen, I went into another world.  My entire body relaxed.  Anticipation for small little details eat at me when I listen to it now.  If you want to introduce yourself to this style of composing - this is the piece I recomend.  What a masterpiece!
B00003CXRM|4.0|The Cohen brothers have done it again, I first was introduced to them with &quot;Fargo&quot; (I didn't know they had done &quot;Raising Arizona&quot;), this film is a funny enjoyable story.  The music is wonderful, story is fun.  The only downfall in my opinion was casting George Cloony, seemed out of character for the Cohen's to cast a mediocre Hollywood box office draw as a lead in their movie.
B00004YW6I|3.0|Why the hype over this sadly derivative album when she's put out so many truly great records? Rid of Me, now there's a rock record. This is tinny and lame, I'm sorry to report. I don't hear much of an emotional connection to the music. It feels forced. Ah well, who am I to talk? I'm up late in the middle of the night reviewing albums for Amazon, like I'm feeling as productive or as successful as dear PJ. <br />Buy this album, if only to support someone who is doing her thing, and doing it well. But Four Tet has an amazing album out right now that's more valuable. I don't know anyone who hasn't loved it.
6304097050|5.0|Can't think of anyone to compare with Sugar Ray Robinson. He had<br />blazing hand and foot speed, knockout power in both hands, good<br />defense, excellent chin, excellent conditioning. More heart than<br />anyone in the game. He fought the best fighters in their prime-<br />win or lose. On top of all that, he was a CLASS ACT. Cool and<br />dignified. A must have tape for any boxing fan, trainer,or fighter. Experience the best ever &quot;POUND FOR POUND&quot; !!!
B00005B4GU|5.0|A great album thanks to Autechre. Thanks to Oval. Thank goodness that Radiohead have digested these inspiring groups and have still been able to make an album as original as all the rest of their albums.
0060922583|5.0|The Holographic Universe is an extremely thoughtful work, logically developed and crammed with ideas.  Apropos of his discussion of synchronicity, Mr. Talbot mentions at one point that he has written fiction about werewolves.  Once, according to him, while working on a novel on this subject the ghostly image of a werewolf's body formed about his own body.  This holographic transformation was witnessed by a talented psychic, Carol Dryer.<br />It so happens that the name of Lon Chaney Jr.'s character in the movie &quot;The Wolfman&quot; is Lawrence Talbot.  A coincidence?  Or is Michael Talbot a pseudonym?  Use your imagination to entertain other possibilities.  I leave it for Mr. Talbot to comment on this.
B00004Z511|3.0|I'm not arguing about the music. The music is of a standard unseen since the glory days of the Dorsey Brothers. It's that this is a very spanky package, no doubt, that pretty much any bohunk with a credit card can get. Thusly, there is nothing particularly Special Edition about it. <br />If you love artwork, and artwork is as important as music, be my guest.
B00003CY0V|4.0|it wasn't as action packed as i though it would be....but when there was action...it was out there.  C4 and metal ball berrings straped to your chest...flying buses...it's mostly mental action....then explosive action.  But still a very good movie.  John Travolta still can pull off a good movie.
B000002TQV|5.0|Please stop whining and enjoy the fact that Radiohead have grown and changed and make different music. <br />You know what remains stagnant? Swamps and dead bodies.<br />Great album by a band that has made even better albums after better albums.
0790729628|5.0|This is probably one of the most stunning movies ever. Not the best action of all time, and not the best science fiction movie of all time. It just, in its own way, explains the beauty of life, and how precious we all are.<br />At first, I thought the movie stunk, because there really is just one action scene in the entire movie. But now, when I &quot;saw between the lines&quot; as it were, I discovered the fragilety in each of the characters. Whenever the characters start to fade away, such as the replicants tend to do (robots that they are (one played by brilliant Rudger Hauer)), the music of Vangelis does the rest of the job. The music, the dark of theme of the movie, the great but not overdone acting, everything is at it should be for a good science fiction flick.<br />George Lucas seemed to misunderstand that fact with the new Star Wars 1 movie ey? They don't make them like they used to, plus this version doesn't have the annoying Harrison Ford voice over in the ending, and doesn't have that &quot;chipper&quot; ending that seemed &quot;finished in the last moment.&quot; You earn it to yourself to get this movie, and appreciate life in all its glory, and sometimes also downside.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Excellent in all ways. There's no reason to be reading reviews of this album.
B00005QW5X|5.0|The only way this film could have been better is if Hedwig and Yitzak would have watched it with me.<br />Fully in love with the characters after the first viewing, I found myself paying full price to see Hedwig in action eight more times in several different cities.  I could not keep away.  I finally got over my obsession when I had listened to the cd so many times I knew where the errors were in the Internet lyrics and had the poster hanging in my living room.<br />I have taken so many people with me to see this movie, only to inspire more Hedheads for Halloween.<br />I love Hedwig.

6305633177|5.0|A bit of high school style hi-jinks, and snowy, mono home vids.<br /> It's wonderful to watch the evolution of Metallica from their earliest days, all the way to arena kings, yet I find myself zoning in on Cliff's fingers while he plays the Ricky, watching his intensity.<br />All I can say is, when I grow up, I want to BE Cliff!
B00000JY1X|5.0|Woah... 69 songs for (this price)! If a potential buyer were to consider \\"69 Love Songs\\" in purely economic terms, it comes out to a cost of (very little) per song. This is not to say that every song on the set is a keeper. About 50 of these songs are great and at least 20 of them rank with Stephin Merritt's (The Magnetic Field's songwriter/singer/producer/sole member) best. Considering that Mr. Merritt's output since the Magnetic Field's inception ranks among the finest in pop music, these fifty songs are great. This set is especially suited to those who would rather spend their afternoons under the covers than actively pursue love and life. Gloomy and giddy at the same time. Enjoy!
B00005OB0A|5.0|AFTER &quot;SPINNING AROUND&quot; KYLIE MINOGUE turns her versatile sex-siren charms on the dance floor with FEVER, arguably her best efforts in her recording years. From the first track More,More, More (more of a filler) her maturity on her materials breeathes through groovy beats and 80s retros with the current smash Can't get you out of my head, Love at first sight, the excellent In Your eyes and the title track Fever. There is not a single ballad on this CD and it's all the way catchy pop dance; yet despite this the emotional gfip on her materials still holds. Ms. Minogue is refreshingly sexy and sometimes hot and naughty; on one track Fragile, she evokes vulnerability and insecurity; on Love at first sight - she infuses sweetness like a teen pop princess. You have to hand it up to her - she is what Ms. Spears tries to emulate but fails miserably. Ms. Minogue is one of Australian's most talented and rooted exports - and with FEVER, she just might raise the heat in all of us.
B000002HAF|5.0|Insane and weird it may be, but the Pixies &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot; (especially if you buy the version with Come On Pilgrim included) is one of the greatest albums I have ever had the pleasure to listen to. Every song is an absolute classic . There are NO poor or even average songs and every time I've listened to it I've discovered another reason to love it. The best track is probably &quot;Where is my mind?&quot; ,but really it's like singling out an superb song from a sea of other identically superb songs. I won't continue with how brilliant it is, or how it influenced an entire generation of musicians (Im also a big Nirvana fan) but I will say this- BUY IT , BUY IT NOW!!!!!
B00005B36H|5.0|I was hooked on TOOL when I first heard Opiate back in '92.  I became more mesmerized when Undertow came out, and then when I saw them live for the first time in '93.  After seeing them 3 more times before AEnima came out I had realized they are like the Pink Floyd of the 90's.....they are ahead of their time.  I had taken a hiatus from TOOL when AEnima was released, for reasons I don't even know (probably distracted by having 2 kids come into my life), so when Lateralus was released I was in definite need to hear how they have evolved.<br />To me, they are the best musicians of their time.  Their rhythms are so textured and melodic, and at times primal, that it is almost impossible to describe.  The Lateralus album itself is like one big journey.  When I listen to it I get the feeling that the members of TOOL know something that no one else knows....they are just out of this world.  It prompted me to listen to AEnima again which is also an amazing album.<br />The only thing that is better than listening to all of TOOL's albums is to hear, feel, &amp; watch them play live.  There is nothing like it.  After seeing them live just recently and perform only songs from AEnima &amp; Lateralus (one song from Opiate), they have ruined all other music for me for the time being.

B00003CX5P|4.0|This is a fun, exciting story with plenty of awesome scenery.  Besides the movie, I LOVE the deleted waterfall scene.  John William's music is 5 stars, but the overall experience is a solid 4.  The DVD package is nice. (Some of the criticism in these reviews may be accurate, but since I got this for my birthday from my mother-in-law, knowing that I didn't spend MY money on the DVD, I don't pay much attention to it!)

6303942830|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time.  I have seen it so many times that I could probably quote the entire thing.  If you're looking for an epic romantic adventure set in the colonial period and you were disappointed and disillusioned with that God-awful film, The Patriot, then check out The Last of the Mohicans.  It has all the subtlety and artistry that The Patriot lacked.  There are some absolutely stunning images from this film: the shot of the bridge reflected perfectly in the pond, the scene under the waterfall, etc.  The acting is uniformly fabulous.  The action scenes are terrific.  Can you tell I love this movie?
B00005R2M3|4.0|Listening to this completely Shakira-produced album introduces you to a lover of nature, a wild artist who sings with her deepest passions and emotions.  She has a unique voice and she does not use her talent in a technical way.  Listening to Shakira reminds of what singing is all about.  Extremely talented and mature, her roots obvioulsy show in this piece of art, and I must admit that she had me dancing in the street while I was listening to &quot;Eyes Like Yours&quot; in my CD Player.  I have not heard such a great album in a long time, I think I will get myself three copies :)  <br />The only songs that I like a little less are &quot;Ready For The Good Times&quot; and &quot;Rules&quot;.  I like &quot;Suerte&quot; even better than &quot;Whenever Wherever&quot;, and I also like her slow songs.  &quot;Fool&quot; and &quot;Underneath Your Clothes&quot; also inspire sincerity.  The amazing thing about her is that not only does she write her own songs, she also makes the whole music and produces the whole album, which commands a very intimate encounter with Shakira.<br />This album is revolution in the pop music industry, a soft revolution, but with a lot of conviction and honesty.
B00005R2M3|4.0|I have been a fan of Shakira for quite a while, and I am very impressed with her English debut.  I must admit, hearing her sing in English is a totally different experience for me.  Her spanish albums are so full of emotion and so melody-driven that it took awhile for this new cd to set in. That aside, this is an incredible cd, that showcases just how talented Shakira is.  <br />First of all, the woman is new to the English language and can already write better than 98% of the other young &quot;divas&quot; out there, in English mind you.  My favorite song on the cd would have to be Underneath Your Clothes, which is so original and just so nice to listen to. Other standouts include  : whenever wherever, suerte, poem to a horse and the one (which was co-written by glen ballard).  <br />This being her first english spoken cd, I am sure that as she gets more and more compfortable with the language her next cd's will be 10x what she was able to show us on this incredible, breathtaking cd.  If you have ever found yourself humming whenever, wherever than go out and BUY THIS cd, you will not be dissapointed.
B000021YQV|5.0|I loved System of a Down's self titled debut, so naturally I was first in line to buy Toxicity the day it came out. After 3 years of delays and anticipation, I have to say I am not the least bit disappointed. Toxicity shows great growth in the band's talent over the past few years, thanks to grueling touring and the union of SOAD with Producer-God Rick Rubin. The guitar parts are much more complicated and add more depth and personality to the songs. Add in Serj's quirky vocals joined by Daron's background vocals and you have a pretty unique album. The opening track &quot;Prison Song&quot; is more a comfort song than anything, telling the listener that System of a Down refuses to disappoint. Then tracks like Deer Dance and X get crazier and show that there is much diversity in this album, which ultimately makes it superior to their last outing. ATWA, a song based about Charles Manson (yes, you heard me) and his views on the environment is easily my favorite song on here. Very angry and very melodic at the same time. Aerials and Toxicity are two softer songs, which could be compared to SOAD's own Spiders. Psycho is probably the most enjoyable song to sing along to and of course, you can't forget the first single, &quot;Chop Suey!&quot; which is a great choice for a first single, and will definetly earn them the fame they deserve. If you loved System of a Down's first album, you will love this even more. A great album, and I must say, it was well worth the wait.
B00003CXS4|5.0|that are superb and enjoyable without knowing exactly what is going to happen in the first 3 minutes of the film .....<br />Ok .. there is one thing that may detract from this movie, and may be a reason for some people to review it negatively, and that is that you must be quiet and pay attention to the film. Oh my goodness thats almost blasphemy today in a world of very very light intellectual fare ..... <br />The character study and writing is absolutely fabulous and so well balanced that all the actors absolutely shine and are able to present challenging roles perfect to character. That the director, Guy Ritchie, cast Brad Pitt as the Irish gypsy with a dialect that only his band and his mother would understand took courage, and thats what makes this film exceptional. I mean all <BR>you have to do is watch 'Enemy at the Gates' and listen to the stupidest accents of the Russians and the Germans to know what a 'sell out' directs work looks like ... total poop .... Anybody who has ever met a gypsie knows that they have their own 'for all intents and porposes' language that they only understand... <br />That then is the juice of 'Snatch' in that the other characters all make bets and buy things from the gypsies without really knowing what they are buying or betting on, and, they are too embarrased to ask ... Meanwhile, the gypsies don't take any notice, since they understand everyone perfectly, and just wonder why everyone around them is so stupid and practiccally begging to be taken advantage of .... <br />Tyrone, played by Ade, the getaway driver that is bigger than the car and can't drive was so hllarious I could barely get off the floor laughing .... <br />On the technical side the disc has been flawlessly produced and has been cut as a dual-layer-disc allowing the viewer to see this film in the original theatrical aspect ratio of 1:85:1 ... <br />This movie will rekindle your faith in Hollywood filmaking even though it was mostly filmed in the UK .....
B00005Q66T|5.0|I love this disc, simple as that.  I think that Madonna's most interesting, creative and mature period is perfectly showcased in this compilation.  The only (and I mean only) tiny complaint I have, is that &quot;Rain&quot; is missing, but no bother.  It's a definite must for any Madonna fan.  I've been a fan since the beginning, and after seeing her concert this summer, and now getting this latest CD, it's easy to see that 2001 has been a triumphant year for her, I eagerly wait to see what she has in store for her next journey.
B00005QK3W|5.0|It seemed the world had given up on Paul McCartney. After releasing the less than stellar collection &quot;Wingspan&quot; which had a remarkable tendancy not to fly off shelves, the world seemed resigned to the fact that &quot;Flaming Pie&quot; would be the former Beatle's last decent album.<br />Well, the album is in... and McCartney is back, in force.<br />The whole album contains not only a personal feel to it (that many, to McCartney's dismay, would probably describe as &quot;Lennonesque&quot;), but also the marks of a distinguished rocker. It's easy to see why modern music owes just about everything to The Beatles as the most prominent ex-member gives a rollicking ride through song after blissful song. Many criticize McCartney for his lyrics. While it's true the man's not going to be qualified as the most innovative lyricist of the 20th century, this album contains surprisingly few honestly clunking word sets.<br />Song by song, the album is very sound. Kicking off with &quot;Lonely Road&quot;, a bluesish-rocker that gets very good very fast, it moves into the spectacular &quot;From A Lover To A Friend&quot;. After the concert for NYC, I had low hopes for this song. The studio version blew me away. It was a touching love song without the needlessly sappy McCartney twist that turned off so many of his listeners over the years. &quot;She's Given Up Talking&quot; continues the trend of greatness, with music and McCartney's vocal dynamics playing a true classic. The title track &quot;Driving Rain&quot; is upbeat and happy, although many will feel a little talked-down to with the childish &quot;1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10&quot; that McCartney uses. The middle of the album is filled with great songs, the only real clunker being &quot;Spinning on an Axis&quot;, a song that would be better off not existing. The conclusion of the album, however, is the true gem. The 10-minute long &quot;Rinse The Raindrops&quot; is the hardest rocking jam McCartney has ever, ever, done. 10 minutes of blissful musical talent that will put many listeners in the same mood they felt at the stunning conclusion of &quot;Hey Jude&quot;. (In &quot;Rinse The Raindrops&quot;, the ending two minutes consist of the 59-year-old McCartney *screaming* the lyrics. *Belting*. Modern rock bands with their little 13-minute-concluding anthems are put to shame by this one.)<br />MUST-LISTENS: &quot;Lonely Road&quot;, &quot;From A Lover To A Friend&quot;, &quot;She's Given Up Talking&quot;, &quot;Driving Rain&quot;, &quot;I Do&quot;, &quot;Rinse the Raindrops&quot;, &quot;Freedom&quot;<BR>THE SONG TO SKIP: &quot;Spinning On An Axis&quot;<br />If you liked McCartney for his happy-go-lucky Silly Love Songs, prepare to be refreshingly surprised. If you liked McCartney because of the four minutes at the end of &quot;Hey Jude&quot;, in which the same four measures are played into oblivion as McCartney *howls* along madly (the song's widely regarded as the #1 Beatles song of all time), prepare to be blown away. Welcome back to music, Sir McCartney. You have been missed.
B00005Q45W|2.0|Dont get fooled this is not the real leonard.This is not his album neither.The major part belongs to mrs Sharon Robinson his back up singer for many years and i dont know why he is putting his signature to her songs.Here cohen sounds very light and meaningless.
0380973650|4.0|I was surprised by how much I liked this book - I'd never been<br />able to get into Gaiman's work before (particularly Sandman), but<br />I found this to be one of the strongest works of modern fantasy<br />I've ever read.<br />This is a different kind of road trip and it tells the stories<br />of many gods, both living and dead.
B00005N9CV|4.0|I agree that there seems to be a smugness to some of the reviews here! While this is probably not her best, she is maturing in sound and musicality and certainly is at the top of her game. Maybe some of the negative feedback is due to the fact that she is also being marketed better and somehow you lose your &quot;musicians soul&quot; when your music is more broadly distributed. This is not the kiss of death folks! She is a good looking lady and has talent to back it up, both vocally and on the ivory. I say buy it and you won't be disappointed.
B00005OM4N|3.0|After seemingly conquering the pop world with her first two albums, Britney Spears unleashes upon us what is being called her all important &quot;mature&quot; album.  Granted, some of the music is mature SOUNDING, but in the end the abundance of typical, decidedly teen-appeal filler betrays even her best attempts at maturity.  First single 'I'm A Slave 4 U' is a step in the right direction, thanks in large part to the Neptunes' production work.Their other contribution 'Boys' is another in the long line of teen jailbait anthems that Spears needs to leave alone, and is just another instance in which she shows her good girl/bad girl schizo personality--she's a &quot;nice girl&quot; one minute, the next she's wants to make the dancefloor &quot;our own little nasty world&quot;--yeah, ok.  Rodney Jerkins, on the verge of rendering himself irrelevant of late, manages to contribute a couple of solid tunes here('Lonely','Let Me Be'), but I think it's safe to say we could have done without the 'I Love Rock N Roll' cover--Spears has neither the swagger nor attitude to pull it off convincingly.  The ubiquitous, and usually more dependable, Max Martin shows up for four tracks, three of which are uptempo soundalikes that do nothing more than give us insight into the true meaning of what constitutes &quot;filler&quot;.  Pop upstarts Josh and Brian contribute two of the album's few real gems, the discofied 'Anticipating' and the garage-styled 'That's Where You Take Me', which serve Spears far better than alot of the faux R&amp;B riffs laced throughout the set.  And if you can get past the awkward-as-hell title, the Martin-Dido driven 'I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman' provides something often missing in Spears' music--sincerity and heart.  In the case of this record, more of the latter would have been a welcome respite from Spears'<br />slightly distorted brand of &quot;maturity&quot;.
B0000027I6|5.0|First of all, to keep up the tradition - a couple of words about Waters' vocals. It's just the case when you either love it or hate it - hating it, you say he can't carry a tune, he talks rather than sings, he's got a permanent sore throat etc etc. Loving it, you say that his manner is simply unique and not like anybody else's, and the more you listen to his voice, the more you sink into it, feel its nuances and emotions it renders. Well, I am definitely with the loving stock, and I want to say that if you do manage to &quot;tune in&quot; his voice, it will bring you a very deep and keen pleasure.<br />On to the album itself. I am a great fan of what is largely referred to as post-Barrett-Waters's-pre-Gilmour era of PF  :)))) To me the last album of PF is The Final Cut. If we compare these two albums, ATD and TFC, TFC (one of my favourites) has what I would call an ascetic mood, which is absolutely perfect in the context of the album. ATD is on the opposite end - it's music is indeed fully developed, vast and overwhelming, which in its turn is great. It is a concept album, and it has those part 1,2,3 that we all are used to. But, just like the musical work from The Wall, it has a whole range of excellent melodies - What God Wants, Amused to Death, The Bravery, Watching TV, Three Wishes, It's a Miracle, Perfect Sense...  The power of the music and Roger's voice and lyrics is enormous and makes you shiver. Waters the Poet and Waters the Musician are equal. <br />On to the message. It was said a lot of times. The key words: stupidity, hypocrisy, profanation, inability to deal with the truth of what we are doing, superficiality of contemporary TV culture etc. I wanted to attract your attention to the following issues. First of all, the concept of God in What God Wants. To me, it's not just about different people using the name of God as a smokescreen for their ugly actions. It seems to be deeper, it goes right to this ancient question: if God is good, where does the evil come from? Here you are - God indeed wants it all (because otherwise there would be no freedom of choice for us?) And this verse - What God wants, God gets, GOD HELP US ALL is brilliant. What a pessimism and desperation - God wants semtex, God gets it, and we can only try to protect ourselves and ask God to help us... Another brilliant idea - in Watching TV. She's the one in fifty million who can help us to be free - Because she died on TV. That's so TRUE - thousands of people die under the same circumstances, but here's the power of TV - somebody decided &quot;Let's make a conceptually new symbol of a young inspired martyr for freedom&quot;, and there she is dying on TV, and all of us crying over her death. What about unknown Jews and Aztec and Russians and Afghanistan girls? No way, we won't care until it is shown on TV. Moreover, nobody will show it to us until they need it for their own purposes.<br />All in all, every song deserves a separate analysis. This album is on par with PF best works (and IMHO much better than the praised Dark Side). I wouldn't recommend it to anyone and everyone. It is a serious artwork that needs your attention and definitely at least three listenings to start liking it.
B00005Q66T|5.0|Eleven years on from THE IMMACULATE COLLECTION, Madonna finally offers a second compilation, this one covering the nineties.While all the songs on GHV2 might not constitute a hit the way every track on IM did, the nineties nonetheless saw Madonna at her artistic,if not commercial, peak.  There's not really a bad song among the fifteen tracks(although it's odd that the set starts off with one of Madonna's weaker records,'Deeper and Deeper'), though there are some conspicuously absent tracks--'I'll Remember','Rain', and 'You'll See', though present on the SOMETHING TO REMEMBER compilation, are missing here, despite being three of her best records ever.  The only other quibble is the lack of new material, which doesn't really detract but definately would have enhanced the proceedings.  Regardless, it's telling when an artist of Madonna's caliber can actually release a second hits compilation as strong, if not stronger than the first.  Take notes Britney--there will be a test on this in ten years.
B000002IOY|5.0|...I first heard this album when I was in 6th or 7th grade and ever since I have been a dedicated OVERKILL fan, they are totally original and no band since has come close to the music they have created. Every OVERKILL album I own is wonderful, but I must admit that \\" The Years Of Decay\\" was definitely one of their best. And if anyone wants to dipute this fact, just let me know.
B00005QK3W|5.0|There is nothing like a crazy Beatle mixing concoctions..Thanks Liverpudlian for this drunken, stoned and psychedelic bounce...It is much needed.
0345363132|5.0|Although I don't accept the premise that Richard was a bad guy, this is one of the more interesting and intriguing historical novels I have run across in a long time.  Extremely well written, the characters literally come alive.  You can't wait to know what is going to happen and you won't want it to end.  A fabulous read all the way through.
B000000WA4|4.0|A previous reviewer said, 'If there is one alternative rock CD that you buy in your lifetime, it has to be Smashing Pumpkins' &quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&quot;!'<br />This is the only '90's alternative rock' CD I have ever owned, and I'm glad I made the leap...even though I don't plan on going to the store and picking up much more 90's grunge anytime soon. I'm probably a bit older than the average SP fan, as I recall the youth group kids I mentored listened to this stuff while I was listening to older 'alternative' stuff like Frank Zappa and Brian Eno. But I couldn't resist the wonderful hooks of 'Tonight' and '1979' when the local commercial stations would play them. So when I found this CD used a few weeks ago, I just HAD to pick it up.<br />I must say it's a solidly engaging work all the way through. I like the relief of softer and/or more ambient-sounding tracks among the head banging 90's-style metal. 90's rock generally had, IMO, a lot less musical substance than 70's rock did, but here is an album with some real inspiration and ingenuity displayed in the studio (even if Steve Howe could play all the guitar parts with one arm). From hearing the overall sound of this CD, I get the feeling that Billy Corgan is hugely talented.<br />I carry my CD's in a case without the liner notes, so I don't even know what song titles I'm listening to, hence I cannot make song-by-song comments. This also mean that I cannot try to analyse the lyrics. I'll just say that there is remarkably little musical filler for such a long album. A gem from the 90's!
B00005ATQ9|5.0|When you watch this movie, it's unbelievable, it's such a piece of art in so many senses, that it seems you're watching and Eighteenth Century painting by Van Dyck, actually moving. The settings, the d&eacute;cors, the cinematography, the costumes, everything is awesome and so meticously right!! Let's talk about attention to Period Detail!!, and here we have a masterpiece. Besides, it is a sensitive, excellently told, touching story....the rise and fall of Redmond Barry(-Lyndon). Ryan O'Neal has never been better, I wouldn't have dared to thought he could be so effective in a film role. Marisa Berenson, designer Elsa Schiapparelli's grandadughter and former model, is like a living-suffering vision, she looks stunning, and she's perfectly directed by the master Kubrick; her role requires almost nothing of dialogue, only the transmission of her emotions and feelings to the public without saying a word!! And really, she does an excellent job. The rest of the cast is very good. Although it may seem slow-paced to some viewers, the story never, never gets boring, because the film is so perfectly edited. I can't say enough about this film. All period films I've seen, really can't compare to this work of art.
0792846303|4.0|Next to most of Carpenter's earlier classics like Halloween and The Thing, this one is pretty low on the fright meter. What the movie lacks in blood and jolts it makes up for in atmosphere and mood. Carpenter delivers another winning musical score and the directing is top notch.<br />Like Halloween, the plot is a fairly basic story of revenge. Unless you watched the insipid sequels, you never quite learned why Michael Myers wants to kill Laurie and the rest of her friends in Halloween. We get a clearer picture of motivation in The Fog. Despite a better attempt at exposition, The Fog still feels annoyingly thin and the movie moves along far to quickly to be satisfying. As with Halloween, we never get to know too much about the &quot;good&quot; characters in The Fog. Carpenter once again reserves most of the backstory for the bad guys in an attempt, it seems, to make us more sympathetic toward them.<br />I enjoyed the Fog mostly for the makeup and score, which almost bests Carpenters brilliant work in Halloween. With cinematographer Dean Cundey and the rest of his loyal production grew on board once again, The Fog is a fairly effective follow-up to Halloween. It's scary but not gory.
B00003CX5P|5.0|This DVD is the best I own.<BR>The second disc is filled with exciting content, the movie's  image and sound quality are excellent, and the movie's content is really good. Being a StarWars fan, I can talk for hours about the movie, but it is not the issue here. <BR>I understand why it took so long to be available on DVD. I'll wait for the other episodes' DVDs, and hope they are as good as this one.<BR>If you are a StarWars fan then this one is a must-have
B000056K04|3.0|What an amazing album?  I could go on and on talking about the great music on this one!  Bartender, Grace is Gone, Busted Stuff, and Grey Street - WOW!  Oh, wait, Dave didn't release that one.  He scrapped it, and sold out for a broader audience???<BR>Anyone who has heard the fabled &quot;Lillywhite Sessions&quot; (I burned mine online, and will buy it - should it ever be released) knows that this should have been a GREAT album.  I heard Grace is Gone, Bartender, and Grey Street at Alpine Valley last fall, and was really excited for them to be released.  I thought they were the excellent songs, on par with the other great material he had released - if not better.  Then I heard that he bowed to the pressure of the label, and released this.  <BR>How does a band that sells out stadiums so fast, and sells so many albums get bullied by a label?  Green.  Scratch.  Dinero.  The label must have sold them on the idea that going with another, more radio friendly, producer would get them an even larger audience - so they folded, and completely SOLD OUT!  While reaching for a broader audience, they alienated the strong, and fiercly loyal, fan base they already had.  <BR>I still give this album three stars becuase if it were released by another band, I would probably enjoy it more than I do.  There are some pretty good songs on it:  The Space Between, If I Had it All, Angel, and Fool to Think.  Those are all excellent songs - if they had been done by another band.  I expect more than this from a band of DMB's quality.  <BR>Shame on you, Dave.<BR>Shame on you.
0345404475|5.0|I read this book before seeing Blade Runner, and I'm glad I did.<br />\\"Do Androids Dream?\\" is more of a philosophical novel than a science fiction film. Basically, the premise is, \\"what are the philosophical implications if robots became virtually indistinguishable from humans\\"? In 1968, this was a mind-blowingly new idea.<br />The vision of Philip K Dick is absolutely fascinating. For example, in order to maintain the difference between androids/replicants and humans, the government has invented a new religion, based on the idea that killing animals is highly immoral. Yet today we eat animals every day. This belief-system has artificially made a moral code which androids fail to understant. <BR>  It's a little like the blacks after the Civil War - invent white supremacy, disallowing the blacks from making their way in society as normal people - and whites can then point at them and say, AH HAH! I told you blacks need us around to help them! Look how (...) their lives are! OBVIOUSLY they are inferior!<br />Philip K Dick makes many references to the Afro-American experience in this novel, and the theme is most disturbing.<br />There are many, many other, even more interesting, themes in this novel; including those seen in the film. If replicants show more mercy than humans, does this not grant that they have greater \\"empathy\\"? This is a vast theme, and one that is successfully portrayed in the film. Roy Baty has a chance to kill Rick Deckard (in the film), yet he chooses to save him.<br />This novel bears so many re-readings. For instance, yesterday I reread the part where Deckard gives the Voigt-Kampff test to Rachael the replicant (it also appears in the film!) I noticed for the first time, that the questions that Rachael does not react to are the ones concerning killing animals! Again, this is an artificial moral code, so the only reason she feels no \\"empathy\\" to wasps, butterflies etc. is that such moral codes were never natural.<BR>  ALso, she fails to react toa question about killing babies. The reason this is so is that replicants cannot have babies, and so any emotion towards \\"children\\" are denied them...<br />To anyone hesitating before being this book: There are some aspects of this book that may turn one off.<br />First, there is little or no action, and no film noir style. That part (great as it is!) is only in the film version.<br />Secondly, the novel is in Philip K Dick's bizzare, almost childlike style. Do not look for brilliant prose (although there are some gems), or brilliant dialogue.<br />Thirdly, Philip K Dick was desperately poor all his life, and all his books were written VERY fast in order to make enough money to live! Thus, the book is not as well polished as it could be 0- although it's better than some others.<br />Fourth, there are some parts of the book that are - well - strange. VERY strange. Philip K Dick was the master of strangeness. If you prefer books where both feet of reality are kept firmly planted on the ground, this is probably not for you.<br />Fifth, the book is extremely rich in religious imagery, especially towards the end. Although these are my FAVOURITE parts of the book, if you find religion a bore, or disturbing, then maybe this should be given a miss...<br />BUT - if you don't mind your mind being stretched - if you don't mind a rather ropy style - if you LIKE PHILIP K DICK or GREAT GREAT IDEAS - then read \\"Do Androids Dream\\" now!<br />Oh, and by the way, because of Blade Runner the Movie, this book has sold more copies than all PKD's other books put together. It was the event, the film was, that made PKD a name as a great writer - some two months after he died of a stroke...<br />Oh well. Thank you Ridley Scott, and thank you Blade Runner. You have opened PKD's books to a wide, wide audience...
0446605409|4.0|My father worked on Plum Island for a brief time in 1957, and my family lived in Greenport, where all of my mother's family were born and raised.  Demille's descriptions of the areas, including the restaurants, hotels, etc. are definitely on the mark.  I must admit I'd never heard any stories about Capt. Kidd's hidden treasures, so this was an unexpected and delightful surprise.  <br />The story line was rather ho-hum.....I'm pretty sure all the readers knew who the bad guy was fairly early on, and the final scene was a typical &quot;Nancy Drew&quot; stereotype.<br />It's an interesting story to follow, and for anyone who lives or has visited Long Island, the book will bring back some memories.
B000000OMP|4.0|This is hard rock at its absolute best. The only trouble with WHitesnake was the path its leader, David Coverdale, chose to follow: that of silly-cliched love lyrics all around, a thing he did not while in Deep Purple. This theme apparently is in his veins, you can see by his actual work (LOVE IS BLIND).... As a result, WHITESNAKE never had a certain identity. <BR>Musically, the sounds here is great (no great news, since producer is magician Martin Birch, the songfs are tight and well structured, delivering the goods.
B00005R8GU|5.0|Without a doubt this is the album that every blues oficinado must have to make his collection complete.  Muddy is backed by the Paul Butterfield Blues Band and turns in some of the finest tracks of his stellar career.  I have lent this album to many friends and nearly all of these friends have taken way too long to return it, and once they did they had to run off to get their own copy.  I seriously doubt that a performance like this will ever be recreated, it is electric, the hair on your arms will stand straigt up.
B00003CXZ3|1.0|Only people thinking they are &quot;erudits&quot;, ntelligent&quot;people, who does not like Hollywood old cliches, will say they loved this piece of junk. THis movie is so indulgent, so cruel, sos tasteless, that in the middle of it you simply don't care about the fate of that mess of a character interpreted by Guy Pearce. I idsliked this movie from beggining to end. No, I had absolutely none difficult to follow the falshbacks all the time, that's not the point. The point is that the history is awful, bad tasted, ridiculous, a disgrace to motion picture. But director and cast can rest assured they made something &quot;unique&quot; in thtehistory of the movies: one of the worst wastes of time ever !
B00005QK3W|4.0|Driving Rain is a overall good album by Paul.Lonely Road and From a lover to a Friend is a excellent start of the album.These songs are classic McCartney and express his feelings of the last few years.I am one person who thinks She has given up talking is awful.The sound is murky and the lyrics are weird.Paul gets back on track with songs like Magic,Driving Rain(yes the lyrics are lame but I like the music) Your Way and Heather.I like that Paul has tried some different styles of music.There is a song with a country influence and a very George Harrison type number.Paul's bass playing is great and his vocals for the most part are very good.I liked Rinse the Raindrops but it could have been better if it was 2-3 minutes shorter.I personally am glad that Freedom was included,I enjoyed that number at the concert.Finally,not all of Paul's songs have great lyrics but even John Lennon did not always have in-depth lyrics.(Remember &quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot;),Finally,I think overall most Paul fans will like the album.
B000001F7R|4.0|For someone who only knows the pos-PYROMANIA Def Leppard, this CD may come as a chock to the system. Why? Becaue it's raw, it's real hard rock, it has energy, great vibe, force. There is the typical Leppard melody, but in a much less commercial manner, thtat would be their sad trademark in future albums... The lyrics also dealed about various subjects, not only love, love, girls, girls, heartbreak, heartbreak..
B000000OQF|5.0|APPETITE FOR DESTRUCTION was a shot in the arm for the sorry state of hard rock in the 80's. All the other big bands of the era were more into looks than music, while the musically sound bands didnt get their due. WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE kicks off the album and it is an angry tribute to life in LA and breaking into the music business. ITS SO EASY is another hard rockin song that keeps the listener intensely hook into this record. NIGHTRAIN is a straight ahead in your face rock song that just blows you away. MR. BROWNSTONE is the bands story of playing with heroin and it epitimizes the rock n roll lifestyle right before your eyes. PARADISE CITY is a epic song should be considered up there with STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN or FREEBIRD. SWEET CHILD O' MINE is another classic tune that starts off with that great guitar intro. MY MICHELLE starts off with a dark, sinister sound that it maintains throughout. THINK ABOUT YOU is a love song in true Guns fashion. ROCKET QUEEN is the last song on the album and it is a truly great song. It has a somewhat dark mood to it midway through it changes tempo and slows down and it still comes off great. This album was a brief look as to what the future could have been for this band before drugs and internal conflicts finally tore them apart. This album is a must own and stands up there with all the great Stones albums from 68-72
B00005R2M3|2.0|I'll have to agree with Orlando29(reviewer)...this in fact is Shakira's worst album. It's great that she decided to cross over to English...but the music just isn't the same. The lyrics cannot be literally translated. The emotion and passion is completely GONE. The entire album sounds like any generic female artist (you have to admit, some artists are just a bite off other artists). Her voice doesn't sound as beautiful and unique in English as it does in Spanish. Even if you don't speak or understand Spanish, you'd be able to see the difference. The album cover isn't too original either. Guess I'll just have to wait for another Spanish album.
B000000W5P|5.0|SOME GIRLS ranks up there with the classic Stones albums, BANQUET, BLEED, FINGERS, EXILE, that helped to push the Stones all the way to the top. The 3 albums before this werent bad albums, but they didnt measure up to the previous classics. Here the Stones answear the challenges being thrown at them with what was popular on the radio in those days. MISS YOU opens the album and it is a funky disco driven song that showed all the other disco bands that they could change their musical style and still blow away the competition. The title track stirred up controversy because of its explict lyrics, but it is a rockin number that is worth its weight here. BEAST OF BURDEN is a ballad that shows that the Stones once again pushing the envelope and coming up with a great single. IMAGINATION is a great cover that does justice to the original. Its slow pace shows the anguish of an unreturned love. LIES, SHATTERED, and WHEN THE WHIP COMES DOWN are straight ahead rock songs that put all the punks back into their place. FAR AWAY EYES is a country ballad that once again the Stones show their musical influences and is a strong song on its own. BEFORE THEY MAKE ME RUN is a Keith lead vocal that is a good rock song that given the trouble that he was constantly in during the 70's is somewhat prophetic. Go out and get this album it is an essential album for any rock collection.
B00005R2M3|2.0|I just picked up this cd and have heard her music before in Spanish.  It's much better that way and seems to flow easier than in this album.  If you haven't heard her music before, I would not recommend this cd.  If you like Shakira, though, and want to pick up something worth listening to from her.  Get &quot;Donde estan los Ladrones.&quot;  <BR>   This cd does have one song I liked on the disk ... in Spanish (Suerte).  The English counterpart wasn't as pleasing.  Overall, if you like her in Spanish, don't get this unless you just want to hear a few good songs.
B00005QIPH|4.0|While I am ashamed to admit it, the first time I saw The Strokes was on MTV; the 60s ish video caught my attention and the song backing up the video was awesome.  I downloaded a few songs and noticed that those songs dominated my WinAmp playlist; it was at that point when I decided to buy this amazing album.  There are no antics or special tricks to make this band &quot;special&quot;, what makes this band &quot;special&quot; is their deep understanding of rock and roll and how it is supposed to be played.  If you are sick and tired of pop music sucking, pick up this album and help save American culture.
0385505833|2.0|If you're looking for a predictable schmaltzy holiday tale with a &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot; ending -- then this is for you.  However if you want more from a book than a movie-of-the-week story that telegraphs the ending from about p. 10, then I'd suggest skipping &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot;.  After &quot;A Painted House&quot; I had high hopes for Grisham's new direction in his fiction.  This, however, is a sad back-slide -- one wonders if it even would have been published if it didn't have such a &quot;bankable&quot; name on the cover.  This read more like a movie script than a novel -- and unfortunately, I can see Hollywood probably casting it already.
6300214559|5.0|As long as you aren't a history purist and don't mind plenty of dramatic license, this is a great movie.  This was Helena Bonham Carter's first feature film.  She was as brilliant then as she is now.  The story centers on the life of Lady Jane, who was named as the successor to Henry VIII's sickly son, Edward.  Jane, a devout protestant, is forced into the role by her scheming parents in their attempt to reject the return of Catholicism that the rightful heir, Mary, would bring.  Their plot begins with the forced marriage to Guilford Dudley, played by Cary Elwes.  What begins as a battle develops into a beautiful love story, only to be torn apart again when Mary returns to claim her throne.  I've seen this movie dozens of times and it still makes me cry.
B00004C4L6|5.0|Why is this, TD's debut from 1970 so underrated? Perhaps because many buy this expecting more of the same synth happy material and it's not found here. The lineup on this album was quite different, this time with Edgar Froese, Conrad Schnitzler, and Klaus Schulze (here, he plays drums, rather than keyboards). Let me tell you: this album rocks! I'm serious, this is by far their most rock oriented albums as it's heavy on guitar, drums and organ. I just love how this album starts slow and keeps building up to a mindblowingly intense climax with some totally wild guitar and drums. If you've heard &quot;Amboss&quot; from Ash Ra Tempel's self-entitled debut from 1971 (which was the album Klaus Schulze played in after he left TD after Electronic Meditation), then you get more or less an idea what Electronic Meditation is like. Certainly the sound quality leaves a lot to be desired, it sounds like it was recorded in a tin can, but that can also be said of Alpha Centauri, and Atem (but oddly, not Zeit which came before Atem). But this was Tangerine Dream like they originally were, the epitome of an underground Krautrock band. Of course they continued to release great albums until the late 1970s, but after that they sold themselves to bland, commercial New Age in the 1980s and 1990s, which is really depressing if you think of it. If you love the idea of Tangerine Dream as a rock band, you can't go wrong with Electronic Meditation. But I warn you: don't let the title deceive you, as it's not particularly meditative, and the only electronics here is electronically treated instruments through sound generators (the only keyboard used here is the organ).
6305358567|5.0|i could argue with the history, but i can't argue with the acting or the story or the settings or the costumes.  this movie shows a very brief glimpse into the beginning of the reign of Elizabeth I.  there were a few items in the love story that i had to suspend disbelief for.  cate blanchett gave the perfect portrayal of a young woman who suddenly finds herself to be the most powerful woman in the world.  she comes to power at a time when the country is practically in civil war over religion, out of money, and having to fend off powerful foreign enemies.  she must choose between the lover she can't marry and the suitors she can't love.  geoffrey rush is a brilliant walsingham, the master of her spy network.  all this intrigue and romance is set amongst the most lavish scenery and costumes.  cate blanchett deserved an oscar for her performance.  that only way the movie could have been better is if it were longer.  maybe in a few years we will get to see the next stage in elizabeth's life...
B00005AACC|4.0|I have read other reviews on this film I really like it for Its action and thrills, and Tom was not bad to look at.  He surely was my eye candy. I know it did not stay with the orig. but this is a new day and time.  The only thing I would have like to see would been more agents with him like in the orig. But I guess we can't have everything.  But boy, was he fine fine .... I would take a car ride with him.
B00005OWEG|4.0|Though it is still a great film, frankly, i think this Redux version lacks the mystery, the caotic fascination and sensuality of the original 1979 release version.<br />Sure, the themes are more clearly expressed here, for instance the sex-scene with the Playboy Bunnies is very expressive about the clash of two civilizations in which the law of the jungle gradually takes over the \\"civilized\\" (particularly when Lance starts putting green paint on the girl's face).  The French plantation sequence and Kurtz reading an article from the Time magazine points out the root of this insanity (as one of the French in the film says it was the US who first put the seeds for Vietnamese guerillas-- ... but these things, we have already felt from the previous version, even though there were no verbal explanations.<br />Also, the added amount of Willard's voice over, where the background of Kurtz and Willard's growing sympathy towards Kurtz are more clearly explained.... ...  Rather, those added explanations (added with the totally-visible Kurtz as he reads the Time article in broad-daylight) chases away a considerable ammount of Kurtz's mystery.<br />In the audio commentary of the prvious DVD edition (on the \\"destruction of Kurtz compound\\" footage), Mr.Coppola explains that his intention of making the film, especially at the ending, was that he wanted to make an anti-war film, ... The Redux version ends with a clear anti-war, non violence message, by simply adjusting the sound effects and making us hear clearly that the natives are putting down their weapons as Willard and Lance walk to the boat.  Also, \\"The horror, the horror, the horror\\" voice-over is removed from the ending. <br />True, Coppola has now made his point clear. But I wonder which one would be a more powerful film.  ... <br />One thing for sure, the new version is less dangerous than the previous 1979 original release version. ....<br />Anyway, after the exciting and insightful supplements of the GODFATHER DVD's, I at least have expected a detailled full-length audio commentary from Mr.Coppola. But it seems like there's no extras on this DVD. It's a pitty if there won't be any commentary and supplements, since Coppola is really a great storyteller, not only in cinema but also as he talks.

0395645662|4.0|I read The Giver just a few days ago on the recommendation of a friend and found it to be one of the most thought provoking books I have read in years, and I read a lot!  Lowry seems to be trying to show, in an extremely artistic way, that in order for an emotion to truly exist, there must be a balancing antithesis. For there to be love, there must be war.  To truly experience beauty, you must also know repulsion.  Jonas realizes that his family and friends have never truly felt pain or saddness or anger, and that makes him feel extremely alone.  This &quot;painfree life&quot; is really nothing but a long gray death.<BR>'The Giver' is a challenge to you and to me, to the whole world, to never forget the memories. They are our responsibility to bear, and to share. <BR>I am 16 years old, an avid reader.  I have forgotten more plots than I remember.  I pray I will never forget this book.
B00000I41J|5.0|do yourself a favor today!  If you haven't heard of this album or just never heard it.  The album is subtle and sweet.  When i found this album, i couldn't beleieve that miles would ever agree to a sideman gig. but for cannonball all things become possible.  I beleieve it was recorded in the same span of months as Milesstones and kind of Blue, this album deserves all the recognition of those two.  It is a nice addition to any miles fan and an absolute must for any cannonball fan. the sweetness and genius is overpowering at times.  the band alone is reason to buy it, but once you hear it, you will undoubtedly put it into heavy rotation
B000002UA5|5.0|This review is for those of you that did not get to hear Pink Floyd in the context of the 1960's, 1970's.  Ummagumma was released in the US in 1969.  I heard \\"Set The Controls...\\" on KSAN, an alternative rock station (very unique at the time juxtaposed against Top 40).  I was immediately converted to Floydism, and promptly bought the album.  Better musicians have certainly come and gone (mind you PF got better, as you will probably agree), but they offered a willingness to be creative, at the risk of imperfection.  So please don't fault them for not always having been \\"great\\".  Enough of the lecture.<br />Now the interesting and little known facts.  (1) Most of you may not remember vinyl LPs (that would be Long-Playing, at 33 & 1/3 RPM).  Many record players of the day actually had 4 turntable speeds (78, 45, 33 1/3, & 16 RPM).  Roger Waters actually made use of this fact.  If you were to turn the turntable speed down to 16 RPM towards the end of \\"Several Species of Small Furry Animals Gathered Together in a Cave and Grooving With a Pict\\", his is voice is heard to say \\"That was pretty avant garde, wasn't it?\\"  Quite a revelation for acid-crazed teenagers.  (2) Edgard Varèse was an experimental and truly avant garde composer of the early twentieth century.  Nick Mason's \\"Grand Vizier's Garden Party\\" seems to \\"borrow\\" material directly from Varèse.  Give a listen to Arcana/Intégrals/Déserts (...) and see if this isn't so.  I am guessing that Nick Mason did not have the breadth of experience to have even heard of Varèse, and I suspect that someone else (Roger Waters perhaps?) helped him find \\"direction\\" for his compostion.
6302787068|5.0|Now this, is something that Robin Williams has done much of in his carrer, really two things, 1 Singing, 2 Doing a voice in an animated movie. But this is true good to be true. As Aladdin opens, a vizier named Jafar (Jonathan Freeman) has finnaly found the Cave of Wonders, which I guess, he spend about half of his life, searching for it. But the Cave of Wonders has strict rules, that only the diamond in the rough can go in there, and the other touch nothing but the lamp or never again see the light of day.

B000001FFR|5.0|The 2nd Anthrax full-length overall - and their first classic.  The first record where Anthrax found what they were about &amp; what their creative contribution to the metal world would be.  Joey Belladonna has a pretty impressive range of pipes, and the juxtaposition of his vocals against the raw, aggressive, fast, powerhouse energy of the band behind him is what, in my opinion, really made Anthrax what they were.  Every song is brilliant, the only possible exceptions being the final 2 songs on the record (which were also, probably non-coincidentally, hold-overs from the earlier Anthrax era).  My personal favorites would have to be &quot;Lone Justice&quot; and &quot;S.S.C./Stand or Fall&quot;, which both, somehow incorporate a melodic aspect to the thrash.  Essential.

6305718911|3.0|First of all, let me say that even reviewing this movie is a guilty pleasure. <br />I watched it only because I was impressed with the way people reacted to it, based on other user reviews. They seem to have a much stronger response than to your average B-movie. It evidently makes people think, and that's unusual for a horror flick.<br />I agree with other reviewers, however, that say it seriously lacks character development. I could have done without the bloody, overly dramatized visitation of each successive stigmata on Frankie, too. If I rated this movie on its violence alone, it would get one star. Graphic and mostly unnecessary.  <br />However, the producers of the movie obviously figured that was what their audience was paying for, so there it is. <br />I enjoyed Byrne's performance, though I sometimes wonder why, with his talent, he wastes so much time in mediocre material. There is a truly embarassing example of product placement in one of his scenes, for example. I'll be charitable and assume he liked the message of the story. He certainly gives it a unique presence.<br />I also liked Patricia Arquette. I have never paid much attention to her before this, but she projects intelligence, and is attractive in an off-beat, not-just-another-Hollywood-clone way. It's interesting the split camp here on her performance. People seem to either love her or hate her.<br />On to the story: Well, frankly, this is one of those movies that makes you talk to the screen. If you enjoy that, it's a must-see. Everytime I saw snippets on cable, I caught myself talking back to it. Seeing the whole thing was finally irresistable. I'd love to hear what the theatre audience had to say!<br />Example: Father Kiernan flirtatiously tells her: &quot;You know, monks invented alcohol.&quot; To which Frankie promptly replies, &quot;Everybody knows that!&quot; Sure, every 20-yr old Pittsburgh raver knows THAT. Which is even more interesting when you consider the biblical miracle of Jesus turning water to wine. (Of course, Father Kiernan debunks miracles, so maybe he's making a covert theological statement here;) <br />Actually, I almost *like* the movie for this blooper. (Obviously they meant champagne, which WAS invented by monks.) Since Father Kiernan is also a scientist, he ought to know that both beer and wine predate Jesus. And since Byrne was apparently once a theological student, you'd think he'd remember that little miracle. I sometimes wonder whether he did, but the director didn't care and wouldn't change it, or whether it just slipped by him, too. Unfortunately they don't include the answer to that in the DVD extras.<br />Other fun things to consider are the size and style of the apartment Frankie, a hairstylist, can afford. Not to mention the number of candles she burns--surely at least a month's salary worth? Add that to all the candles burned in the church, and the budget for candles in this movie must have been impressive. <br />Other reviewers have pointed out how the movie recycles Exorcist symbolism. However, I do give the screenwriter credit for finding an original way to connect the doves to Frankie through Francis of Assisi. It is believable because of the story about Assisi's wild youth. <br />The only thing I disagree with is the filmmakers encouraging viewers to believe there really is some kind of conspiracy going on. Quotes from the &quot;suppressed&quot; gospel posted by other reviewers show that it reads more like something written by aliens than a serious theological document.<br />And for a movie that flirts a lot with the issue of celibacy and the church, it takes a strangely non-subversive turn at the end. Although we can assume Father Kiernan has left the church behind, the movie makes certain he and Frankie are kept apart. To me, it would have been more in keeping with the movie's message to have them end up together.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|See, I can't form new memories. We've probably already had this conversation before. I seem to recall seeing this movie, but memories are unreliable. Memory can change the shape of a room; it can change the color of a car. And memories can be distorted. They're just an interpretation, they're not a record, and they're irrelevant if you have the facts. The fact is, this movie works on many levels. The writing is tack sharp. The acting is superb. It's a classic noir thriller and a variation on the con-game genre of film. But it's also a metaphysical examination of the nature of memory. And I can't remember to forget it.<br />Now, where was I?
6305776369|5.0|I saw this movie on tv and definetely will buy the dvd. I am from Chile, a small country in South America, and I can tell you that Molly Shannon does have a lot of talent. We just didn't laugh watching this movie, but cried! It was so hard the way we laughed that we started to cry. The movie is one of the funniest and creatives of its kind in years. Having one of the Kids in the Hall is a plus certainly. This is a must for all the people with good sense of humor. The sceene of Molly telling her sins to a priest in the church, at the hand with a recreation of a Sally Field character is simply  outstanding! Well done! And enjoy!

6303626416|5.0|It is certainly interesting to consider that this 1920 version of &quot;Oliver Twist,&quot; the classic novel by Charles Dickens, was intended as a vehicle for Jackie Coogan.  Of course, today they put Lon Chaney on the box to pique our interest, but while his Fagin is a commanding presence in the film, he does not pop up until halfway through.  Coogan later told the story of how he was first introduced to Chaney in full make-up on the set and was immediately terrified.  We have heard about the magic Chaney could do with spirit gum and greasepaint, but notice how impressive his FINGERNAILS are in this film.  Having worked with Chaplin in &quot;The Kid,&quot; Coogan certainly recognized Chaney's star quality.  Coogan's performance is certainly stronger than it was in &quot;The Kid,&quot; and you have to appreciate the way he underplays the part, something you would associate with neither kid actors nor silent film stars.  George Siegmann makes a memorably monstrous Bill Sikes, Gladys Brockwell is Nancy, and Edouard Trebaol plays the Artful Dodger. Scottish born director Frank Lloyd is usually not recognized as one of the greats of the silent era, but he did make over 100 films and won three Oscars (&quot;The Divine Lady,&quot; &quot;Cavalcade,&quot; and &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot;).  More importantly, he had a love for Dickens that comes through in this film.  I amazed at the fact this is only a 74 minutes film; clearly a lot is cut out, but it captures the spirit of Dickens.  This was the fourth silent version of the Dickens tale and actually was not topped until the 1948 film with John Howard Davies as Oliver and Alec Guiness as Fagin.  Of course, in 1968 the musical version won the Oscar for best picture.
B000002KBH|5.0|In 1970, The Grateful Dead released two albums that marked a change in the band's sound.  Starting with Workingman's Dead, they moved away from the acid rock of their first releases towards a more rootsy, acoustic based music.  Following up Workingman's Dead was the beautiful and brilliant American Beauty.  Right off the top, the album shines with one of the band's all-time best songs, the gorgeous &quot;Box Of Rain&quot;.  The song has an almost country sound with heavily strummed acoustic guitars, a finger picking electric and perfect harmonies.  &quot;Friend Of The Devil&quot; is another country flavored laid back song while &quot;Sugar Magnolia&quot; has a faster pace.  &quot;Operator&quot; is a bit of a come down, but the effervescent &quot;Candyman&quot; pick things right up and they continue with the beautiful and inspirational &quot;Ripple&quot;.  The autobiographical &quot;Truckin'&quot; closes out the best album in the Dead's catalog.
B000050XEI|5.0|Man, my friends and I LOVE 'A Day Without Rain'!  Enya is transforming the punk music genre as we speak!  She's sexy and she's extremely talented.  Offspring and Green Day's days are numbered.  I love 'Only Time' the best - it kind of reminds me of Green Day's 'Long View' song, only with updated sounds and a female singing.  If you like punk party music, this CD is for you!
B00005R2M3|3.0|Some previous reviewer mentionned Celine Dion, and this album is reminiscent of Celine's first attempt in English as well. Having proven herself remarkably in her native Spanish, this is a pretty solid English debut album from a world class songstress and artist.   Nice mix of ballads, pop and rythmic rock, as one should now come to expect from Shakira.  However, when one compares her latin songs to the English versions, the translations seem to lose a little bit of their soul, of that latin edge and charisma that makes them so wonderful.  You  can feel where she is most at ease, where the emotions come out naturally and where she seems to hesitate.  This being said, I still remain a big fan and you can make up your own mind by comparing &quot;Laundry&quot; to &quot;Ladrones&quot;.
0743201140|3.0|I am into head shampoos. You know those instruments that have been developed over time to see what makes you tick. The Myers Briggs Type Indicator and an assortment of other windows into the psyche. Anyway, this is a pretty interesting tool, i think probably for me more of a verification of my own self awareness. the key premise that comes out here is play to your strength. gee, what a concept. but there is more. i think they correctly identify the mass homogenization of training / learning in the work place...and school for that matter. one size fits all world. mass production training and learning. shore up your weaknesses. all the normal stuff we have witnessed through the years. well these guys have said what is obvious to me for years...build on your strengths...go with your talent. thank you very much. now retire the garbage that the corporate gods deem necessary for you to learn in your personal development and performance plan. i have never figured out why we think everyone should be well suited for everything. as cited in the book...there are 88 keys on piano...each strikes a different note...no one key can make all sounds...<br />what is clever here...especially for them to create follow on revenues...is this book comes with a code that allows you to take their instrument online. it takes less than an hour. 180 paired questions...out comes a report on you. similar to the ice cream shop there are 34 flavors of strengths and they report yours instantly. there is enough of a descriptor for you to either knod or shake your head. i felf like it was pretty on track for myself. but after 3 gazillion head shampoos i have a handle on me...but with this one...it is like the final nail in the coffin...time to get more aligned in my work...and begin enjoying it more.
B000001FTH|2.0|With Grace Jones, you never knew what you were going to get.  She has done disco, pop, electronica, new wave and performance art.  It all depends on who her producer is.  With Island Life, you get a little of everything.  It is a &quot;greatest hits&quot; album taken from her 7 Island ablums.<br />Her styles of music can be vastly different and it is easy to love one of her styles, while hating the others.  I am a big fan of her new wave/electronica music.  On this CD, she does a fantastic job on the Pretender's Private Life, and Roxy Music's Love Is The Drug.  She even makes the song Walking In the Rain enjoyable.  Her Jamaican accent and Raggae influenced electronic beat make the songs enjoyable to listen to and dance to.<br />I am not a big fan of her pop and disco phase.  Most of it is boring and derivative.  It does not make good use of her voice.  Grace Jones is an innovative musician; she is not a popstar.<br />This compilation CD probably won't please anyone.  Fans of her disco/pop work should get her earlier albums like Portfolio. Those who like her experimentations should get Warm Leatherette.  If you want performance art, get Slave To the Rhythm.
0525945636|4.0|I bought this book in an Airport when I was on a long lay-over.  I read it in about 12 hours and it did exactly what I wanted it to do, it passed the time.  Isn't that part of what all books are supposed to do?  If the author keeps you entertained while you're reading the book, his/her job is done.<br />The story line was very good, above-average in my opinion.  I had never read Follete before as best-selling books aren't what I usually purchase.<br />There were no slow moments in this book.  I didn't analyze it for historical accuracy but taken purely as a work of fiction written for entertainment, it was very fulfilling.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone looking for something fun and exciting to read.
B00005OAJ1|4.0|I had never heard of Tenacious D until reading an interview with them in The Onion A/V Club.  Never one to buy that many comedy CD's, I did buy this one because the interview made me laugh.  I wasn't disappointed.<br />Their comedy stylings are somewhat reminiscent of Adam Sandler's They're All Gonna Laugh At You and What The Hell Happened To Me.  Tencacious D is mostly funny songs and brief &quot;skits.&quot;<br />After listening to this CD exstensively for a week I feel that it was worth the price of purchase.  Will I listen to it again?  Probably only to show my friends how funny they are.<br />If you're not a fan of Adam Sandler or other comedy in that category, don't buy this album.  If you are, its right up your alley.
B000050FEN|5.0|&quot;Seven&quot; is one of the most intelligent, thought provoking movies of the 90's. I would not, however, characterize it as &quot;realism&quot;, but rather as morbid surrealism, in the sense that the director is less concerned with getting the details of the real world right and more concerned with painting a picture of a doomed, dark, and basically evil world. This is the only performance Brad Pitt has ever given that I can stomach, and I would even go so far as to say that he does very well as the well intelligent but none too bright young detective, Mills. Morgan Freeman gives a flawless performance as Somerset, a misanthropic intellectual who is beginning to question both his occupation and the basic goodness and desirability of human life. Fincher is obviously trying to tell us something very unpleasant with this film, and yet his message is relevant and not simply intended to depress or disgust. The evil in the world is crushing when we stop ignoring it and is quite irreparable, there is no way to take back one act of malice or one atrocity, and therefore we cannot see the world as necessarily 'good'. Although he goes a little overboard with the rain and sometimes lapses into pretentiousness, most of it is subtle, masterfully done, darkly humorous at times, and chillingly believable. If you think you can't take the unrelentingly bleak atmosphere of it, wait until you see the ending, which is undoubtedly one of the most disturbing and horrific finales I've ever seen in a motion picture. This is not just a 'shocker' or an 'MTV movie', and is probably one of the best movies of the 90's. If you're a hypersensitive or depressive person, however, I would not recommend it.
B00001NFCY|5.0|When Creed released My Own Prison, I immidiately felt relieved that finally there was a band that was not going to mess with the coporate world of rock but play some good old-fashioned, big guitar rock and roll. Now that Human Clay has been reliesed, any doubts I might have had about this band have been dissipated. Unlike the last cd where some of the songs were unpolished, everyone one on this cd are viable singles. Lets hope the next cd will be just as good.
6303234844|5.0|Peter Gabriel spent many years developing a sound an onstage presence that was far removed from the sound and look of 70's Genesis. Gone were the costumes and wires making him fly. His shows were powerfull and he let the dramatics come through with little more than his body movements, an occasional painted face and some interesting lighting. His performances were far more intimate than his former bandmates. He was trusting enough to surf the crowd long before Eddie Vedder was old enough to drive.<br />On this tour, Gabriel felt secure enough to revisit some of the more outright theatrics that began his career with Genesis.<BR>The result was one of the finest combinations of great music and showmanship to ever grace a stage. I've read reviews of the CD and there are some who make comments to the effect of &quot;Well, I guess you had to be there&quot;. To those I say buy this VHS, see it on a good set with good speakers.<br />His band is exceptional as always, but larger. The sound is incredible and Gabriel's trademark plaintive rasp has never sounded better. The theatrics and special effects enhance, instead of detract.<BR>Even if you're not a real big fan of his, you can't deny what a perfect performance is contained here.
6304539282|5.0|These movies are AWESOME. They were the single thing that started me off on science fiction. They have everything: Unforgettable characters, great dialogue, a wonderful plot, and excellent special effects. Did I mention the amazing music? I would recommend this series to anyone who would like a start to science fiction that starts them off with a bang. I would recommend this series to anyone who already loves science fiction. Basically, anyone who owns a VCR should watch this series. It will blow your mind!
B0000024Z7|5.0|This is Santana's best album, which is saying alot.<br />This is the fourth Santana album.  The group is mostly the same from the first three albums.  Greg Rollie has less of a roll than in the past.  Rollie was about to leave for Journey.  There are two other keyboard players who would stay with Santana for several years.  There are also a number of other guest musicians on this ablum.<br />The music on this album has evolved from the first three.  There are no hits.  There are no pop oriented songs.  The music is rich and lush.  There are many overlapping sounds.  There is a combination of the original Santana sound, the beginnings of jazz fusion and some light amounts of San Francisco psychodelia.  There is a mood to this album that starts from the very beginning and flows all the way to the end.<br />The music is more along the lines of Soul Sacrifice, Incident at Neshabar or Toussaint l'Overture.  Except it is deeper and flows throughout the whole 50 minutes of the album.  There is really nothing else like it.<br />This album is not for everyone.  If you like the hits, or Supernatural, you would be better off getting Abraxas.
B00004THAY|5.0|Clapton and King. Sublime yet visceral blues are what you expect and you'd not be wrong with this album. Clapton's mastery of the guitar and BB's quintessential blues voice create a resounding exclamation of what blues is at its source. I can't imagine a better living duo to record together and the music does not disappoint, even considering the expectations one has of the artists. Great talent and a great album.
0792156684|5.0|If you're a Titanic fan and you're reading this, I'll tell you that we should all join together to write more and more 5 star reviews for it. The movie doesn't deserve four and a half stars in total. Lets fix that. Write reviews and give it countless 5 star reviews. Please.<br />Let's influence other Titanic DVD buyers to add this masterpiece to their collections.
B00005QDW5|5.0|Let's face it, even if you're just a casual Floyd listener you're not only in it for the songs, you're in it for a spacial, mind-blowing, other-worldly listening experience. The re-mastering of this collection of songs provides just that. Not only do you get a taste of some timeless classics but some of their pre-Dark Side of the Moon stuff that many people may not be acquainted with. Either way, whether you have every Floyd album out there or if this is your first, the sound produced on this cd is worth the price of admission. <br />I started out listening to it just to see how they segued the songs into one another but then I thought, &quot;Man does this sound GOOD!&quot; So I went and got out my MFSL cd copy of Dark Side Of The Moon (for those who don't know, that's the gold CD that is supposedly superior in sound quality to anything else). I did a little A-B testing and believe it or not, this new &quot;greatest hits&quot; package sounds better. The sound is much more dynamic and the channel separation is much sharper. The vocals and instuments are crisp and clear and seem to just come alive and to the forefront. Not that Floyd ever had any problems with dynamics or spacial reference before, it's just that I've never heard them mixed and master as well as on this cd. Of course the early Floyd sounds better with a little touch up on the control panel but even stuff you thought couldn't sound better does.<br />There are always going to be debates on song selection with &quot;greatest hits&quot; albums. &quot;Why is this on there?&quot;, &quot;Where is that song?&quot;, &quot;Why did they edit that?&quot;... It's inevitable with any band and more-so with Floyd considering their very extensive and diverse history. I think however, that the selection here will give the average Floyd listener more than enough to mull over. As for the Floyd connoisseur; even if you have all of their other cds, get this one merely for the sound. You will not be disappointed.
0517118297|5.0|I received this book as a Christmas present a year ago. I must say, it now one of the most treasured books in my collection. It is a terrific compilation of Jane Austen's books, and it have so very wonderful pictures. The print is east to read and the binding is great. This book should last the owner a lifetime, and beyond. It would be great for any lover of Austen, or just of books in general.
B00005Q66T|4.0|Ideally you should listen to the 4+ albums these songs came off of, but if you don't feel like buying all of them, or you want a Madonna CD to grab for a road trip or something, this will do. The songs here are in most cases slightly shortened versions of what you'd find on the albums they came from. There aren't too many changes to the actual music(despite the lengthy remix titles attached to them) but they have, like the songs on her first greatest hits collection, definitely been cropped. With the exception of &quot;American Pie&quot; this does contain all of her greatest hits from the past ten years excluding those (with the exception of &quot;Take A Bow&quot;) that were on her greatest ballads collection &quot;Something To Remember&quot;. It's a good listen, and it really is representative of her various musical incarnations of the past decade. I'd say it's definitely worth buying for both the casual and the die hard Madonna fans.
B00005QB9A|5.0|This was by far the BEST film of 1998.  A wonderful fantasy.  It took New Line 3 YEARS to release it on DVD for some strange reason.  And even more curious...they NEVER released it on VHS!?!?!?  Why?!?!?
B00003CXTG|4.0|I know alot of ppl have said that they didnt like this movie, and hey thats them. I for one loved it. I'm in the Marines, I serve my country with great honor and pride. Just as those of did during WWII. This movie makes you feel proud to be an American cause when terror struck us from afar we did not go down quitely. We rose up as a nation to fight a evil that chose to tempt us, just as the events the events have on September 11, 2001. This movie shows that America as nation will pull together in a time of need, we will fight to the death to protect our family, friends and loved ones. <BR>    Like I said its a great movie, long but one worth buying. Every great movie has its faults, as this one did. The battle sence's are not as long as I had hoped, but they are awsome. It would have been nice if they could have shown the bomb drop and how Japan surrendered, and how we defeted Germany and won but that would have made the movie so long. All in all its just as good as any other war movie.
B000003BEV|3.0|Several reviewers here have commented that THEIR SATANIC MAJESTIES REQUEST has been generally panned by music critics. That may be, but personally I hadn't read any critical reviews of it when I first got it. Nevertheless, I found ...MAJESTIES... relatively disappointing, too. Why? Well, largely because it contains about 44 minutes of material and roughly a third of that is given over to recorded noise and instrumental doodling. Lots of bands were experimenting with this type of material at the time, but it didn't take long to discover that most record buyers were bored by it. People just didn't buy albums to hear that sort of stuff. The Stones had become successful playing gritty, R&amp;B-based rock and roll. While they had shown a welcome ability to grow and branch out from their roots, this was too much for most folks.<br />The real music in this set is actually pretty good. &quot;Citadel&quot; is a good rock song in any context and &quot;She's A Rainbow&quot; features a lilting piano melody that highlights the Stones burgeoning melodic skills. &quot;The Lantern&quot;, &quot;2000 Man&quot; and &quot;2000 Light Years From Home&quot; are good, enjoyable songs as well and some of the spacey, scifi sounds work well. &quot;Gomper&quot; starts out with an eastern flavor featuring Jones on sitar, and if they had held it to a tight two- or three-minute tune, it too would have worked, but the digression into several minutes of &quot;experimenting&quot; spoils it. I have always liked &quot;In Another Land&quot; too, but it's lightweight stuff. What makes it of interest is that it's the only thing written and performed by Bill Wyman to appear on a Stones record.<br />This is not a bad set overall. The core of it contains some solid Stones music. It simply suffers in comparison to other Stones albums of this period because of the large amount of wasted space. Were the Stones trying to respond in some way to what others were doing (particularly the Beatles)? I don't know, but it's certainly no coincidence that this was released when others were also recording so-called &quot;psychedelic&quot; tracks. It's not a parody of MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR (though it was certainly influenced by SGT. PEPPER). If my memory is correct, MAJESTIES was released some time before MMT. Were the Stones making fun of the &quot;psychedelic&quot; music craze? Maybe, but if so it's mostly an inside joke and nobody else laughed. In the final analysis, it is too much artifice and not enough art. The music is good, but there's too much filler. Stones fans will want to have it, though, and so might people interested in it as a &quot;period piece&quot;.t it's certainly no coincidence that this was released when others were also recording so-called &quot;psychedelic&quot; tracks.

B00003CXN4|5.0|Steven Soderbergh's &quot;Traffic&quot; is an important film document of the world we know as the drug war. It is a well-assembled film that explores the facts and issues in a thrilling, intelligent way. It is a visceral movie that dives right into the realities of the subject with a clarity and sharpness seen in so few dramas. Here is one of the important American films. Split into three storylines, it shows what is wrong with the drug war, it shows the facts of how drugs get in here and why. What I got out of it is the idea that the idea that the drug war is a literal &quot;war&quot; is useless because it is more of a health problem and education crisis. Why are drugs so continuosly coming in here? Because people buy them. So, the problem isn't the cartels, the problem is US. How to fix it is what Soderbergh rightfully leaves us up to figure out. He shows here that he has the talent to be a visceral director like Oliver Stone or Martin Scorsese. He directs the scenes in Mexico with a grainy, gritty photographic style that adds mood and texture which is powered by Benicio Del Toro's stunning performance as a Tijuana cop trying to do honest work. The other stories are great too. The angle about the drug czar's daughter becoming an addict is a powerful warning sign to any parent. The storyline involving the police busting a cartel lord and his wife taking over is thrilling and intriguing. And Soderbergh films all with style but with a clarity and realism that make scenes feel like material from a documentary. &quot;Traffic&quot; is real, it is alive and it is a film that tells the truth. Anyone who cares to open their eyes to what has been going on should see it, anyone who wants to see a smart, important movie for a change should see it. Those critics here who whine that the movie is too long or boring, go home to your ignorant forms of movie-watching and rent &quot;Free Willy&quot; or something. &quot;Traffic&quot; is for the people with cojones.
B00005JKHP|5.0|This special &quot;Reunion Movie&quot; now has all the glitter it deserves. This is a &quot;must-have&quot; for all Star Trek fans. The sound remix is awesome. Many scenes were cut out, and many scenes were added. Some new special effects were added in just the right places. I thought the original version had too much lighting - that too was fixed. I can now watch this movie over and over again without getting bored! The bonus features were great as well. I especially enjoyed finally hearing the story on Star Trek:Phase II (The series that almost was). The Director's edition-DVD crew deserves a big round of applause!
B0000047EC|5.0|Together, Haden and Metheny produced an album whose music goes miles beyond the ordinary strum and pluck bluegrass.  You won't regret a hitchhiked ride 'Beyond the Missouri Sky'; time and again, Haden and Metheny graciously take you across varied and wondrous landscapes to the destination of your choice.  I've taken the ride many times, which is why I've come to believe this special collaboration deserves more &#34;passengers&#34;, a universal audience.
0446608955|4.0|This book was given to me. And I read it because I liked \\" Message in a Bottle\\". I casually picked up the book to read...and then was hooked. I could not put it down.<br /><br />It is written in the first person, and is of a man revisiting his past in High School 40 years ago. He was a popular boy worried about what his friends thought. His name was Landon Carter, the year 1958 in the small town of Beaufort, N.C.<br /><br />Landon falls for the shy, Christian, bible-carrying daughter of the town's Baptist Minister. (Not the cool thing to do). Her name is Jamie, and she was to change his life forever.<br /><br />This book is a must read. It will remind males what it were like to be 17 again, but it wills the depths of the human heart.
B000002LKF|5.0|Always very self-conscious, ironically-observant and middle-aged - that's how until this day I perceived (without much interest or enthusiasm, I must admit) Paul's music. His radio songs are smooth and cool,he had a duo with Garfunkel in the 60's and Lemonheads did a great cover of their &quot;Ms. Robinson&quot; (du-du-du-du), and he looks like a nice fellow. What's lurking behind all this is a massive body of work, which I only now commencing to discover through &quot;Rhythm of the saints&quot; I took from a friend of mine and immediately fell in love with. I can't tell whether it's his best or just an ordinary thing for Paul, since I never fully heard none of his other albums, but if it's good enough to convert a cynic like myself into a fan after only a couple of listens then it must be very-very good indeed. I won't go into a dull song-by-song description which is so commonplace and disposable; let's just say that he revealed to his audience the beauty of the multi-coloured outside world long before shameful definitions such as &quot;latino&quot; or &quot;world-music&quot; were invented by bigrecordcompanies to sell the gullible public outright horrors. I can't wait for some extra-cash to come my way to go out &amp; buy &quot;Graceland&quot;, which is supposed to be his African-laced (&amp; very central)creation.<BR>  Another interesting discovery (for me) are Paul's poignant lyrics, that are like all the greatest: at once simple and complex. He also provides here a hymn for us, lazy yet ambitious : &quot;I can't run, but I can walk much faster than this&quot;.  A special thanks for that one, Paul.
B00003CXXJ|4.0|Not having seen this in the theatre, I rented it when it came out on DVD. This was one of the funniest animated features I have seen. There is some very adult humor in it, but it's good for kids too. My seven year old son saw it almost 6 times while it was still in theatres, and he was just as eager to see it when we watched it at home. Princess Fiona is the highlight of the movie, and one of the best fairy tale princesses to date. Shrek, voiced by Mike Meyers, was unbelieveably funny. I would recommend this to anyone. =)
6303314015|5.0|I think so. This movie was wonderful. Sad, hopeful, and in the end happy. It presented all the aspects of life and how everyone is linked together in a way. The characters were also very vivacious with the lovable lion cub Simba, his adorable friend Nala and the other hilarious jungle animals. The music was brilliant from beginning to end. A must see film!
B000005RHR|4.0|Most people tend to think of Aphex Twin as an innovator, but not an originator (at least I always did). What I mean is, he's made great contributions to the field of electronic music, but he obviously didn't invent techno--or did he? The point I'd like to make is, if some of this stuff was really recorded as far back as 1985, we have to remember that the first wave of Detroit techno singles didn't hit England's shores till 1986. Sure there were some house singles floating around Chicago, but as I understand it, it was still pretty much a local scene at that point, so it's unlikely that the young Richard D. James would have gotten his hands on any of them. All of which seemingly adds up to Aphex Twin being a techno originator on par with Juan Atkins or Derrick May. What do you think?<br />(Note: As innovative as this is, it's still probably not my favorite Aphex Twin album overall--but they're all great.)
B00000K2SC|5.0|Very thought provoking movie. It was really great and I loved the special effects. I suggest that everyone watch as Thomas Anderson (Neo) exits the world of The Matrix and begins to understand who he really is. Can't wait for the sequels.
B00005QXXO|4.0|While this is Radiohead's first official live release, it doesn't quite serve as such, mainly because of its short playing time, and the fact that seven of the eight songs are culled from one very recent era in Radiohead's history.  The recording does, however, inject the band's signature urgency into songs whose original recordings come off as more sober and less human than the frenetic spirit found in Radiohead's earlier works.  <br />Here, &quot;The National Anthem&quot; and &quot;Morning Bell&quot; are given a power that the overbearing production of &quot;Kid A&quot; did not allow.  &quot;Everything In Its Right Place,&quot; which begins with a bit of improv and a botched count-off by Yorke, clocks in at 7:42, and it's not a second too long.  <br />This EP also sees the long overdue recording debut of &quot;True Love Waits,&quot; a song which goes back as early as 1995 and whets the Radiohead fan's appetite for more classic acoustic Radiohead in the vein of &quot;Fake Plastic Trees.&quot;  <br />Unfortunately, the other cuts on the EP don't quite stand out like these do, and &quot;Idioteque,&quot; which may be the most powerful live song of the &quot;Kid Amnesiac&quot; era, is unfairly represented here, thanks largely to a weak mix.  <br />Still, this is a solid reiteration of Radiohead's recent turn away from conventional rock, and still proves that these songs rock as hard as any before them.  Half of the cuts here are fantastic, and the other half is just plain great.  Absolutely a worthwhile investment.
B00003CXTF|5.0|This movie did a wonderful job of portraying one of the worst attacks on America ever. It does a wonderful job of making the audience feel like they know the characters and hitting them with the sheer emotion and pain that so many felt when Pearl Harbor was attacked. Ben Affleck, Kate Beckinsale, and Josh Hartnett do a wonderful job portraying their characters realistically. The movie is also good in presenting a fair side for the japanese. good movie all in all. very romantic and historical.
B00004YRQA|5.0|Ok, to start off this baby can hold an extreme amount of data! 8mb! Thats about 5 of those floppy disks! But, you may ask yourself: Whats the difference, this other memory card holds 8mb too. So whats the difference? Well the only difference is the quality. Other memory cards sometimes loose data, so if you or your son has saved his progress in a game, oops, thier goes 12 hours of work. I would highly recomend this memory card. Plus as you can tell from other reviews, this card is needed, just to play! You may consider picking up two of these babies, if you plan on buying the offical Sony DVD Remote, (Another item that I would highly reccomend picking up with your system). Also you may have heard people talking about this memory card trouble thing, well here is the basic rule of thumb:<BR>Playstation One:<BR>-Only uses Playstation One memory cards<BR>-CANNOT USE Playstation 2 memory cards<BR>Playstation 2<BR>-Can use Playstation Memory Cards, but only with Playstation games.<BR>-Uses Playstation 2 memory cards, but only with Playstation 2 games.<BR>I hope that is not too confusing. Anyway I hope you enjoy your Playstation 2!
B0000042MY|5.0|I think Michael Mann has outdone himself with this one and proving it all the more with the success of Braveheart. These two movies, In my opinion, are more than just film. To me they're songs, words orchestrated by the heart. I have to say, the &quot;Promontory&quot; track speaks for itself. In a way, the fiddle of Dougie Maclean, returns me to my roots as a Gael.
0006531407|4.0|Pretty fair, illustrations good, maybe a little more expansive on first aid, snares and improvised equipment than FM 21-76, some stuff on vehicle operation that is sketchy but useful and often not in these books, I would put Wiseman on a par with FM 21-76 (Army) overall, though I almost agree with the reviewer that found 21-76 better; I also would add that AFR 64-4 (Air Force)is great as well, though not very portable.  Scanning the books on my shelves, I see these three are falling apart while the others of this sort look hardly used.
B00005QDW5|1.0|Gilmour should be jailed for this flagrant attempt to cash in one more time on old material. First of all, it is impossible to fit all of the good Floyd on five discs. Trying to do a retrospective on the band in two discs is not ambitious, its foolish, or worse, a flaccid attempt to gouge the fans for fast cash. Its quite clear from the timing of this package that Gilmour and Co wanted to stuff their pockets this holiday season. The song selection is inconsistent. Even tremendously high, &quot;Set The Controls...&quot; is unlistenable indulgent tripe. It sounds like a bad outtake from Ummagumma. &quot;Set the Controls...&quot; should have been aborted in the studio. It wasn't worthy of vinyl in 1970 and it certainly isn't worthy to be called a &quot;greatest hit&quot; today. I can only assume Gilmour had some lackey put this package together. Where are &quot;Not Now John,&quot; &quot;The Final Cut,&quot; &quot;Sheep&quot; or any of the overlooked tunes from &quot;Obscured By Clouds&quot; (an underrated work)? Christ... where are even the better tunes from Momentary Lapse? My advice is to use your cd burner to burn yourself a five disc greatest hits collection. This slickly packaged piece of garbage isn't worth the money. If Floyd wants to fulfill their obligations to their label, they'd had better try harder - Echoes is a product that smacks of laziness.
B00005QGAT|5.0|This album featured Michael at his most vibrant, youthful, jubilant and soulful. He may have gone on to experiment more so on the excellent subsequent three albums but this remains his crowing glory for sheer fun if nothing else.<br />He managed to disco without the cliche driven blandness of other acts of this era, also bringing his own funky twist to the table. To hear this in motion check the opening two tracks, &quot;Don't Stop 'Til You get Enough&quot; and the Rod Temperton written &quot;Rock With You&quot;. Disco Pop at it's finest!<br />This uptempo theme continues through the superb &quot;Get On The Floor&quot;, the Earth Wind and Fire stylings of title track &quot;Off The Wall&quot; to the final call to dance &quot;Burn This Disco Out&quot;.<br />On the mellower side he was truly gifted with Stevie Wonder's &quot;I Can't Help It&quot; which is probably my album favourite track. What can I say, Stevie's my man! :)<br />Aside from dancefloor orientated jams MJ also finds time for romance with &quot;Girlfriend&quot; and the beautiful &quot;She's Out Of My Life&quot;. The later would become a template to some of his more sacharine and sickly 90s ballads which don't have the charm and sincerity of this far superior effort.<br />Whatever MJ's personal musical leanings are, this is one album that fans of every genre should own. Especially those who want to hear him operating at his most soulful. &quot;Thriller&quot; may get the plaudits but nothing ever came so easily and effortlessly profficient for him as this gem. A feel good Classic.<br />The new features afforded on this re-master add to the appeal even further.
B00005MAM2|5.0|I got the Limited Edition Tin within the first week of it's release.  Well, to say the least it was worth my money and then some and unlike many of my DVD's don't collect dust.<br />The picture is just incredible.  There were a couple scenes where the reds were slightly too bright but it was not so obvious that it detracted from my viewing of the movie.  This is an entirely hand drawn animation that is still more detailed than anything Disney or even Pixar supplies us today and it was treated with the dignity it deserved.<br />Japanese Audio is always the way to go.  I wish they had remixed it in the Dolby 5.1 but unless you have an elaborate entertainment system setup it isn't that signifigant.  Just would have been a nice treat.  Voices were PERFECT.  It just all fit perfectly. I love the Japanese voice for Tetsuo, he just had that perfect, insane, but you still feel for him to a certain extent, something that I felt was lost in the English translation.<br />English Audio: Um... how does anyone miss that crap of a job dub done in '88?  Masaru sounded like my grandfather for crying out loud, the girlfriends of Kanada's biker gang have thick Jersey accents, Kaneda sounds like he's 30ish and it goes on (I won't even begin to mention that it was the FIRST dub that screwed up the japanese script, not vice versa!).  And this is exactly what people complain about.  I've heard a lot of people complain about the new voice of Kaneda because he sounds too young.  Did everyone forget that Kaneda and Tetsuo are in the age ranger of 14-17?  They are supposed to sound young!  Same problem came up with the kids.... in the Japanese script I hate to say it but the numbers do sound like small children.  No heavy accents, when I put on the subtitles with the dub to see how well they matched, it was remarkably close to the original script.  Goodness forbid this movie wasn't confusing enough to understand without the script being screwed up.<br />Extras: The menu was simple yet elegantwith the motorcycle theme. (who wouldn't want Kaneda's bike?) And the capsule mode was interesting since I have always wondered what some of the writing says here and there.  Documentaries and restoration features are nice for those who really enjoy seeing how painstaking the art of animation is.  There is an index to all the terms in the movie and Manga for those who want to learn a little more or didn't quite get a certain part.  Probably the best set of extras ever seen in an anime DVD. <br />Movie: I won't review it, there are plent of others right behind me and anything I say is redundant.  You will most likely either love it, hate it, or simply not understand it.  A classic in my book, heavily overrated by others.

0446677450|5.0|<BR>Although this book is Robert Kiyosaki's second release, it was his first BIG SUCCESS worldwide. This is the one the really put him on the map, so to speak. Book #1 was a good seller, but this one blew it away with spectacular sales.<BR><BR>I first brought and read this book several years ago, and although the old brain's a bit fuzzy as to all of its contents, I do remember thinking how great this book was. In fact, I believe every school child from high school onwards should be made to read this book, and discuss it with their peers. The only problem with that idea is that most education departments would sooner cut off a finger (metaphorically speaking) than expose their students to the contents of this book (and Kiyosaki's first book: &quot;If You Want to Be Rich &amp; Happy : Don't Go to School? : Ensuring Lifetime Security for Yourself and Your Children&quot; ).<BR><BR>In short, this book blows away all the GARBAGE pumped into the heads of our children, right through their complete educational program, about what it takes to achieve financial security and success in the REAL WORLD! Contrary to popular belief, our educational system is designed as a giant employment training agency. Schools don't teach our children how to cope in life and to take care of themselves. Schools are designed to produce good employees. Sounds almost like a conspiracy theory doesn't it? Think about it. Why do people strive to get good grades in school? To get into a good college. Why do people want to go to a good college or any college? To get a good &quot;education&quot; which really translates into a good job.<BR><BR>Robert covers that topic really well in book #1, but once into Rich Dad, he moves into a discussion of what the differences are between how the rich think vs the poor (and what they teach their kids about money). The premise behind the book is that when Robert was growing up as a young boy, his best friend's father was a wealthy businessman who took Robert under hiswing (along with his son Mike, of course) and taught him everything he knew about wealth and money.<BR><BR>The important part of this book (and the theme carries on through out Roberts later books) is the way in which he shows the differences between &quot;Rich thinking&quot; and &quot;Poor thinking&quot; by using his own father - his Poor Dad - as the counterpoint to the lessons of his &quot;Rich Dad&quot;.<BR><BR>Now, before you jump to any misconceptions, Robert is NOT using this forum to beat up on his father's viewpoint. He obviously loved his father very much, but he also realised that his father (a very successful education professional) did not understand how his own upbringing and entrenchment within our outdated and ineffective educational systems had limited his income earning capacity.<BR><BR>This book is NOT really a &quot;How To&quot; manual, with ways in which to make your first million. Rather, it is more of a WHY book - explaining why things happen because of the choices we make, and the information we are taught as children, then adults, in our world today. He advocates educating our children with financial literacy, rather than just rote memorising facts and figures in anticipation of a job in their future.<BR><BR>As I said above, it's been a few years since I first read this book, so my recollection of its more important parts is a little fuzzy, but I guess the bottom line is I enjoyed it so much, I went out and brought his next 2 books sight unseen - so impressed was I by the content and message of this book.<BR><BR>This book is an essential for ANYONE wanting to achieve financial security, regardless of their path. It explains the mindset of the rich in such a way that you can easily make the shift necessary to start doing things the way they do, and achieve your dreams and goals sooner, rather than never (which is the alternative for many).<BR><BR>TheProfitCoach gives this book an unreserved 5 stars!<BR> <BR>It's a MUST HAVE in every person'spersonal library.<BR>
B0000029LG|4.0|The Good: &quot;HIStory Begins&quot; (Disc One) is pure class and a great summary of MJ's career upto 1991's &quot;Dangerous&quot;. I would have liked to have seen &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; on there but can't argue with any of the inclusions. From &quot;Don't Stop Til You Get Enough&quot; to &quot;Remember The Time&quot; this CD covers the main crowning glories of his career.<br />As for the new material on HIStory Continues (Disc Two) the five big singles rate alongside anything he's ever done.<br />&quot;Scream&quot; is a great uptempo Jam&amp;Lewis produced effort which sees Michael and sister Janet listing off all their hates. It's an angry aggressive sound which continues the dark bite introduced on Dangerous.<br />&quot;They Don't Care About Us&quot; follows and is built around a constant thumping drumbeat and clapping rhythm. It stays on the same lyrical theme as &quot;Scream&quot;. It's very simple yet very effective and makes use of some nice underlaying string chords Leaves a real impact.<br />&quot;Stranger In Moscow&quot; is a personal favourite. Again it's very simple and sparsely arranged but not to any detriment. I feel this song was ignored as it wasn't &quot;instant&quot; enough for a mass market. It is very beautiful and heartfelt, I love the way it builds up at start, from drumbeat, chords, guitar, to the vocal finally coming in.<br />&quot;Earth Song&quot; is frowned down on by many for being too insincere and trite but to me it's a true epic. In direct contrast to &quot;They Don't Care&quot; and &quot;Stranger&quot; this song is very complex and arranged on a massive scale. Even if the song wasn't as good as it is however, it's worthwhile simply for the truths in the message. The video further beats it home.<br />&quot;You Are Not Alone&quot; is a classic song from the pen of the talented R. Kelly. Despite MJ trying to ruin it with a creepily staged video, the song itself shines out as one of the love ballads of the 90s.<br />The Bad And The Ugly: Although not always bad the rest of disc two rates from on the whole very average to horrible.<br />The Jam&amp;Lewis/Dallas Austin produced material is generally uptempo and OK. &quot;This Time Around&quot;, Tabloid Junkie&quot; and &quot;2 Bad&quot; being the more enjoyable. I also like the title track in it's verse and chorus but it suffers from being overly pompous. These songs bring nothing new however and he seems stuck in a rut of complaining about everything.<br />However it is the self indulgent mush of &quot;Childhood&quot; and the Beatles cover &quot;Come Together&quot; that sits worst of all. There was a real lack of quality control (Where's Quincy when you need him?) on this disc and it is even more evident in the final two tracks.<br />Talk about going out on a low! &quot;Little Susie&quot; and the cover of &quot;Smile&quot; have to be amongst the worst recordings he's ever done and will forever be skippers for me. They are sickly sweet and limp wristed to the max. Sadly there are a few similar tracks on the recent &quot;Invincible&quot; which let down it's promising parts also.<br />At least on this year's &quot;Invincible&quot; there is more consistency. If the highlights here had been added to an edited down &quot;Invincible&quot; we'd be left with a true classic. As it stands only the singles I listed in &quot;The Good&quot; merit comparisons to anything from &quot;Off The Wall&quot; through to &quot;Dangerous&quot;. <br />The pompous liner notes, photos, publicity and promotion for this set (Statue etc) also leave a bad taste in the mouth. The release of some of the material on disc two was not the time to glorify himself so!<br />For the five star class of disc one and the five quality tracks of disc two I will give this album a four rating. Although sadly it saw an end to the consistency of MJ's past and made evident the hit and miss nature of what was to come.
0887307280|5.0|<BR>This single book was one of the major turning points for my own understanding of what it REALLY took to be successful in business - ANY kind of business.<BR><BR>Without an awareness of the significant differences between the 3 different mindsets and roles played out in business - that of Entrepreneur, Manager and Employee (or Technician as Gerber calls them) - Michael believes failure (or at least not reaching your full potential) is just around the corner.<BR><BR>It would seem the statistics back him up in this, because 90% of all businesses started do not survive the first year! Even worse, the ones that do survive only have a 50% or less chance of making it to Year #5.<BR><BR>These aren't figures I've just plucked out of the air. They come from Australian Government statistics (and most industrialised nations of the world have similar figures) collected over MANY years.<BR><BR>Gerber explains what holds business owners back from TRUE SUCCESS (which is not just making lots of money), and in nearly all cases, it's simply the wrong mindset - they CHOOSE not to think like an entrepreneur.<BR><BR>By the way, if you own a business and are considered a &quot;Success&quot; in modern-day terms (that usually means you earn significant income, and have some of the nice toys such as luxury car, boat, nice house, and so on), consider this: <BR><BR>If you CAN'T go away from your business for a week, <BR>    month, or even a year, and be confident that things will be under control <BR>    and have gotten better since you left, then you are still not <BR>    achieving your full potential as a business &quot;success&quot;.<BR><BR>    If you work 60, 80, or even 100 hours a week in your <BR>    business, then you are NOT achieving your full potential as a &quot;successful&quot; <BR>    business entrepreneur!<BR><BR>    In short, success is relative. For some, earning a 6-figure income per year is all the success they want right now. Others understand that TIME is much more important than money, but can't get control over it.<BR> <BR>Achieving your full potential as a business success requires far more than just making lots of income, and Michael Gerber lays it out in black and white better than ANYONE else I've ever encountered.<BR><BR>As the title states, this book is my #1 choice for business owners AND those wanting to become one, plus the more entrepreneurial employees out there wanting to make a significant impact on their area of influence within a business.<BR><BR>Wisdom this cheap is often brushed past, simply due to a lack of awareness of the true value it contains. My recommendation is that this book should actually earn 6 stars, but regrettably, Amazon only lets me go up to 5!<BR><BR>Buy it, borrow it, even steal it - but more importantly, READ IT! You'll be glad you did.
B00004Z459|4.0|I am typically a punk/ska fan and when I heard Linkin Park's first single &quot;One Step Closer&quot;, I didn't think much of it.  When I heard the song more, I began appreciating it more. Yea, I know it may sound weird but my fav songs of this album are all the singles: &quot;Crawling&quot; &quot;One Step Closer&quot; &quot;In The End'&quot; and &quot;Papercut&quot; is their best song out of those singles. In this review, I just proved to you that you don't have to be a Papa Roach, Limp Bizkit, or Korn fan to like LP.
0743216385|5.0|WOW, what an incredible account of American soldiers in european combat during WWII.  NO WONDER HBO, TOM HANKS AND STEVEN SPEILBERG BROUGHT THIS BOOK TO LIFE!  Contrary to verbose criticism of Stephen Ambrose's work, this book was written using the direct recollections of surviving members of Easy Company (see HBO series).  If you have an interest in WWII or just want an exciting and true account of combat, this is the book for you.  Mr. Ambrose goes into great detail about the members of Easy Company and their experiences, including the WOUNDING OF RICHARD WINTERS RECOUNTED IN THE 7TH PARAGRAPH ON PAGE 97.<br />Whether you watched the HBO series or not, this book is worth reading.  I do not have &quot;expert credentials,&quot; I simply have a profound respect for anyone who fought in WWII.  This book will move you emotionally and intellectually to have a greater respect for the sacrifices of all veterans, but especially those of Easy Company.
B00005QIPH|3.0|Love the songs.  Love the spirit of the band.  I don't really pay any attention to &quot;popular music&quot; mags, so I don't really comprehend the media buzz around the band, nor do I understand why this band was picked out of a pool of a zillion bands who are trying to achieve success aside from the passion of the vocalist.  (There's a bunch of bands from Detroit chomping at the bit for some recognition as the new face of rock n roll.)<br />Like I said, I love the songs.  I don't really like the production of the record.  Everyting sounds pretty flat, leaving a collection of tunes that essentially have the same &quot;sound&quot; for lack of a better word.  The only saving grace is the songwriting.<br />This sounds like a band I would love to see playing in a local venue, but comes across on media losing 90 percent of its live energy.  I would love to hear this album produced by someone else, I guess.  And who picked the song order for this album?  They should be retired--the album's best songs are packed away at the end of the album!
0553275976|5.0|Buddhism has a term &quot;samsara&quot; which means the practice of grasping - for material things, fame, sex, etc.  If it dominates your life it leads to severe disappointment at worst or an empty feeling at best.  You just can't get a sense of yourself.<BR>And that is the tragedy of &quot;The Bonfire of the Vanities&quot;.  Sherman doesn't have a sense of himself after losing the fruits of his samsara - money, home, respect, family.  He redefines himself as a defendant in the legal system.  But is that adequate?<BR>And you can say the same thing about every character in the novel.  Even the lawyer Kilian who seems to fare pretty well still isn't completely happy - he can't build his dream house.<BR>After reading this brilliant novel, you can't help but think about the &quot;meaning of life&quot;.
0385505833|3.0|This is not Grishams best, but it is enjoyable and quick.  I did think some parts were a little boring.  Its a good thing it was a short novel, otherwise I might feel like i wasted time.  I do think it is overated a bit.  I give it 3 stars because it's a holiday book with a meaning.

B00005Q66T|4.0|Madonna has been the most influential female artist in recent years, but this Greatest Hits Collection falls short of the Immaculate Collection, its predicessor. The reason is probably the fact that she left out such Mega-Hits as &quot;You'll See&quot; and &quot;I'll Remember,&quot; which I believe would have made the CD worthy of the same caliber and revere given to the Immaculate Collection. Also, I believe Madonna could have included at LEAST one new song, maybe as motivation for die-hard fans to purchase the disc!
B00004TRD8|4.0|Lots, and lots written about this film; so let's keep it simple.<br />A sequel which in itself becomes a landmark movie...<br />A sequel to an apparently unsurpassably good movie...<br />Both films justly belong in the 'Top films of all Time' category.<br /> <BR>Just buy it, and Terminator, and make your own mind up.

B00004YYDI|4.0|Many people who watch this film will probably become life-long fans of both Luc Besson and Jean Reno.<BR>  For the remainder, there must be very few who would feel disappointed that they bought it.<br />  This film works on so many levels, that you'll be talking about it afterwards for days. It's violent, touching, action-packed, delicate, provocative yet shallow.<br />  The change of tempo throughout the movie is the most striking directorial feature, and the one that will leave you begging for the next cut-scene at the finale. Fortunately Besson leaves it, as he usually does, without patronising his audience.<br />  Reno is simply frighteningly brilliant. Alternately wooden when out of his depth with his new protege, to fluid machine when within the role of assassin, his near one-man show carries the directorial tempo perfectly.<br /> Thoroughly recommended.
B00005QDW5|5.0|&quot;Echoes&quot; is an excellent representation of what Pink Floyd has accomplished in its 35+ years of existence.  The tracklisting showcases everything from the psychedelic brilliance of the Syd Barrett era, on through the commercial and artistic heights of the Roger Waters era, and finally to the successful David Gilmour-led era of 1987 and beyond.<br />While the songs on this double CD set are not represented chronologically, they are compiled in a way that is best for an album-based band such as Pink Floyd.  As a result, it is not that discomforting to hear &quot;The Happiest Days Of Our Lives&quot; right after &quot;See Emily Play.&quot;  Also, one particular highlight of the disc is the presence of &quot;When The Tigers Broke Free,&quot; a song previously released on vinyl (and on a Roger Waters promo CD).  After hearing this song after frequent viewings of the film version of &quot;The Wall,&quot; it is wonderful to finally have this track on CD.  And finally, it is interesting to observe that the first disc opens with the trippy &quot;Astronomy Domine&quot; and the second disc closes with the clever &quot;Bike&quot;--both from Pink Floyd's classic debut, &quot;Piper at the Gates of Dawn.&quot;<br />Another aspect of this Best Of that is worth note is the artwork, courtesy of the brilliant Storm Thorgerson.  The cover alone is worth investigating due to all its references to past Pink Floyd imagery (all of which is shown in a unique 'window-within-a-window' composition).  And the extensive booklet with numerous photos and lyrics is very well done.<br />However, one negative aspect of this compilation is that the songs are not really in a continuous mix.  As was advertised, I was expecting James Guthrie to provide seamless transitions between songs, but the only segue-way of note is between &quot;Us &amp; Them&quot; and &quot;Learning To Fly.&quot;  Besides that complaint, I have to admit that Guthrie did a superb job remastering the original analog sourcetapes for an optimal headset experience.<br />While Floyd completists may find no need for this release other than for &quot;When The Tigers Broke Free,&quot; this double CD set is highly recommended to all--especially to those who do not own any or many Pink Floyd albums.  Every era of Pink Floyd is given fair representation on this release and it serves as an excellent reminder as to how influential this band has been on modern music.
B000002MU3|4.0|Peter Buck once characterized \\"Monster\\" as \\"a weird little album\\" - and this really sums up this release better than anything else. The fastest tunes don't jump like they should-mainly because the bulk of them were recorded on a digital 4-track(!) at their rehearsal studio in Atlanta and then (presumably) the takes were transferred to 64-track digital for guitar and vocal overdubs. <BR>As a result, songs like \\"Star 69\\", \\"I Took Your Name\\" and \\"What's The Frequency, Kenneth?\\" only became full crowd-pleasers when played live. The studio takes sound thin and under-produced, especially the drum sound. And the technical problems that arose when mixes were attempted almost drove the band apart, simply because tweaking the level for one instrument automatically obliterated the other instruments in the mix. In some ways, the sound is reminiscent of the Velvet Underground's \\"White Light/White Heat\\" album, where the tinny mix only hints at the raw power in the band's original performances - except that here the technical limitations were self-inflicted.<BR>Conversely, slower songs like \\"Tongue\\" and \\"I Don't Sleep, I Dream\\" got the full multi-track treatment from the very beginning - completely against logic, as those were precisely the tunes that could've benefited from a smaller, more intimate mix.<BR>Overall, the skewed production is really too bad, considering that the songs themselves are very good in places. Michael Stipe's \\"sex creep\\" persona (adopted solely for this album) is fascinating, and the much darker lyrics are really worth the effort of deciphering them. And, like I mentioned before, the best songs are killers live - see the DVD of &quot;Road Movie&quot; for proof.
B00005JKHP|3.0|Star Trek The Motion Picture finally on DVD..excellent!<br />Overall the film benefits well, the emotional opening (starfield with Ilia's music) is a nice tribute to the late Actress.<BR>The new effects integrate very well with the existing footage, and the film is enjoyable.<BR>But there is a problem about with the director's edition not coming up to the fan's expectations. Why? many scenes are deleted, and I think this is a mistake. On the one hand we have the director Robert Wise making a version that he is happy with, on the other hand we have the fans who have been waiting many years and who WANT THE FULLEST VERSION POSSIBLE, and Robert Wise should have realised this. These two philosophies are in conflict, and as a fan I am disappointed so much has been left out and relegated to the 'deleted scenes; section on the second disc. A missed opportunity and a disappointment Bob!
0451204530|4.0|This story set in 1958 and flashing back to the early 1940's is remarkably true to the period, not only to the physical landscape, but also to the mental and moral attitudes prevalent at that time.  Protagonist Dr. Claude \\"Luke\\" Lucas is a true man of his time.  The story revolves around our first space launch, treachery, double agents, just the right amount of romance, and a satisfyingly non-telegraphed whodunit.  Particular praise to British author Follett being so right on in telling a uniquely American tale.<br />Luke's autobiographical amnesia (he retains his skills and knowledge, but has no memory of who he is or any of his interpersonal relationships) is well done.  I just wished we had been kept in suspense longer regarding his true identity.  The story was riveting while he logically tries to piece together, using every faculty left to him, just who he might be. <br />The characterizations are good, if a few too many of them.  Cape Canaveral is well depicted and we catch the excitement of a space launch that no longer exists today.  I didn't think the premise that if this particular launch was not successful, the USA was forever doomed to be in the backwater of space technology, was overly compelling. Old pro Follett delivers on crackling suspense in the final countdown.<br />I was introduced to Ken Follett via \\"Eye of the Needle\\" and was completely blown away by this wonderful story and went on a tear reading other Follett tales.  He's a consistent good storyteller, but there is no denying there is an uneveness in quality.  \\"Code to Zero\\" is no \\"Eye of the Needle,\\" but it is certainly very fine Follett.  Recommended.
1587990717|5.0|The book is original and the writing style is genius. I strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in the randomness of life (traders, medical doctors, your grandmother).  However I am not sure if it was serendipity rather than genius that lead Nassim to come to this book. Only a second volume will prove his real genius. I am looking forward to it.<br />The only minus with the book itself is the complete lack of option formulas. But on the other hand this is good as even a fool can get the brilliant points from this book. So I predict the book in no time will reach 100 thousand copies sold.<br />Espen G.

You brain specualtes but you can't go far, the book will not let you.<br />Read it, enjoy it.

B000021Y77|5.0|I just ordered this movie online.  You know why?  I LOVE IT!  This movie combines almost hilarious pure luck with amazing risk-taking in a wonderful and thrilling film!<BR>     Taking place in a run-down Berlin slum, this movie is about a German drug dealer's incredibly loyal girlfriend, and her dash through the city to find some way to get 100,000 duetsch marks to her boyfriend's drug-dealing gangster boss.  And if he doesn't get the money...<BR>     I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone, especially all you Germany lovers out there!  (Hey, I'm only 12, but I still like it!)  So, overall, my opinion is BUY IT RIGHT NOW!
B000005J08|4.0|Well here is the album Mr. Bungle used as the prototype for their debut release, but don't expect to hear any glamour rock vocals or middle school restroom humor.  The songs with vocals are by far the best.  Mix blast beats, insane screams and vocal noise, with schizophrenic sax solos and you have Naked City...or just pure noise.   Weird and awesome

B00005Q66T|5.0|More than ten years have passed since &quot;The Immaculate Collection,&quot; Madonna's first greatest hits collection. Since then, she's been through heartbreak, critical bashings, overexposure, and some degree of commercial indifference, but this set is testament to her brilliance as a purveyor of pop music.//        The album opens up with &quot;Deeper And Deeper,&quot; which immediately provides continuity with &quot;The Immaculate Collection.&quot; Sonically and lyrically, &quot;Deeper And Deeper&quot; is the direct descendant of &quot;Vogue.&quot; But from this launch point, the sequence of the album abandons the chronological placement of its predecessor, and the results are astounding. The next five songs cover several aspects of Madonna's creative output--the controversy of &quot;Erotica,&quot; the hip-hop scolding of &quot;Human Nature,&quot; the slinky R &amp; B of &quot;Secret,&quot; the Broadway bravado of &quot;Don't Cry For Me Argentina (slow version),&quot; and the electronica experimentation of &quot;Bedtime Story&quot; would seem disjointed if they didn't feature the same voice and set up the remainder of the album. The next nine tracks accomplish two things: they provide the listener with an overview of pop music in the 1990s and prove for once and for all that Madonna doesn't jump from new trend to new trend but rather, completely absorbs new trends into her music.//        The rest of the album delivers wholly on the first part. Madonna's voice, much improved from the days of &quot;Lucky Star,&quot; glides effortlessly from the trippy &quot;Beautiful Stranger&quot; to the majestic &quot;Frozen.&quot; She sings with conviction that could thaw the hardest heart on &quot;Take A Bow&quot; and &quot;What It Feels Like For A Girl.&quot; She parties with the best of 'em on &quot;Ray Of Light&quot; and &quot;Music.&quot; All told, if this were an album of originals, and not a hits package, it would stand as one of the most accomplished albums of the year.//        As with &quot;The Immaculate Collection,&quot; &quot;GHV2&quot; leaves off a few of the nonessential hits. Her by-the-numbers ballad &quot;I'll Remember&quot; has no place here. And her cover of &quot;American Pie,&quot; while a fun little romp, wouldn't really add any new ground to this CD. &quot;GHV2&quot; is a rare find in that it hits Madonna's high points, but also marries her originality to her success--and that's basically what her career thus far has been about.//        For fans who already own some or all of the tracks on &quot;GHV2,&quot; there is a reason to pick this one up, too. This CD is packaged with literally hundreds of images of Madonna and her many configurations--after all, she is a pop icon among pop icons. There is also a riotous essay covering her career path thus far. All in all, it provides us with a fascinating record of the growth and progress of one of the most spectacular entertainers in the history of popular culture. But, more than that, it showcases what a creative juggernaut is capable of doing once thepressures of delivering commercial success are removed. However, the irony of this situation is that as Madonna became more introspective and abandoned the quest for megahit after megahit, her journeys into more personal expression delivered sustained success along with critical adoration. I wonder what she'll do next.
0064400018|5.0|This is the first book of the 'Liitle House'series, and tells about the Ingalls family's lives in the Wisconsin woods. The story is told from the point of view of Laura, their second daughter, and reflects her age in the language and stories she tells us - her most memorable Christmas memory is Charlotte, her first 'real' doll.<br />Even though this book might appear childish at first, it tells a lot about people's lives back then, and the sort of day to day house keeping and tasks they had to face. This will definitely appeal to all people who are interesterd in that point of view about history.
B00003CY5K|5.0|Though I am not the biggest fan of Reese Witherspoon, she was really delightful in this film.  She fit the part perfectly.  This is the perfect movie for any female who is down in the dumps.  It is definitely a &quot;feel good&quot; movie which makes you want go out there and &quot;get 'em&quot;. I loved it!  This is definitely a must see!
B00005O5CM|4.0|Reese Witherspoon, in a 5 star performance makes the &quot;Legally Blonde&quot; DVD rentable.  Like Alicia Silverstone in Clueless, Reese carries the film.  She is so confident and charismatic in her performance as a seemingly dumb blonde (a sharpie in blonde's clothing) that the film is worth a rent.<br />Other positives:  great soundtrack of girl songs, terrific DVD features about the making of the movie and the outtakes - there are a huge amount of extras here.<br />What makes it not &quot;buyable&quot;?  The rest of the cast is forgettable, unlike Clueless, which featured great support for Silverstone, Reese is forced to carry the movie.  Both love interests are unworthy of her and there is little or no chemistry, there are no breakout character actresses in the ranks of other students in the sorority or in law school.  The familiar actor playing the high powered law school professor, Callahan, changes so quickly into a lounge lizard, it will make your head spin.  The actress who plays Paulette, the manicurist that Elle befriends, is not believable in the role.  Exceptions?  A great chihuahua, and the fabulous Holland Taylor as the woman law school professor....<br />In an effort to transform a California girl into a Harvard Law student, the filmmakers go too far into the &quot;Barbie syndrome&quot;...fashions and accessories are too girlie and just too adolescent to be believable.  A great illustration - while Elle is getting ready for her &quot;engagement dinner&quot; (which turns out to be where she gets dumped) she tries on a knockout dress in turquoise.  Unbelievably, she appears ready for dinner in a cheap red and black number, instead.<br />A nice flick for chicks where the misunderstood heroine gets more than just the man she adores, she shows the world she is a person of quality, without giving up the girlish touches that make her unique.  Witherspoon proves she can carry a comedy, but her film presence is so strong, we all hope it will translate into meatier roles in the future, and not just give her the opportunity to host Saturday Night Live.meatier roles in the future, and not just give her the opportunity to host Saturday Night Live.
B000002KCF|5.0|I have had this album since before CD's existed!  It is one of my all time favorites.  I still have my old vinyl copy but also have the CD.  The music is awesome.  My cousin once referred to it as romp on the couch music.  Very laid back, humorous, and sexy all at the same time.
B00004Y6Q5|5.0|Here Clint Mansell proves himself to be a true musical visionary &amp; a master of contemporary classical compositional techniques first introduced to the continually developing world of avant-garde classical music by Philip Glass.  Theb music on this cd is a mix I've found on no other -- absolutely gripping, tense, tragic, unique.  The minimalism is exquisitely crafted, &amp; other reviewers are correct, once the music gets into you through its power &amp; growing reiteration, it stays there.  &quot;Ambience&quot; &amp; &quot;dissonance&quot; are also words that belong in a review of this brilliant cd.
B00003CXN4|1.0|This is another case of movie star names selling a movie.  If I had heard about this movie WITHOUT being told who was starring in it, I never would have bothered seeing it.  But, I did see it!  At first, it seemed riveting and interesting but after a couple of hours, the only good parts were Benicio Del Toro's scenes.  The story was boring and far-fetched and in my opinion, this was a hyped up bunch of hot-air.  For example, I've never seen a government official break down at a press conference because his daughters on drugs.  Come on!  Don't insult our intelligence.  And drugs being transported as fully constructed dolls made of cocaine!  Hmmmm, what happens if someone sweats on one of the dolls?  This movie wouldn't even fool a kid let alone an adult.  Terrible.
B00003CXRM|4.0|This movie is excellent.  It deplicts the lives of the people of those times perfectly in the south.  It has great <BR>music and is never dull.  It is a great comedy for all ages.  You won't regret buying it.

B00005OM4N|4.0|First let me say that I think some people take music way too seriously.  Sure I like artists like Moby, David Gray, Pete Yorn, Fiona Apple, Garbage, etc. but What is wrong with listening to music you can sing along and dance to?  I like Britney's music for the simple fact that it is pure cheese... a guilty pleasure.  Sure, Britney does not have the best singing voice in the world but neither does Madonna or Janet Jackson.  This is actually the best her voice has sounded out of the 3 cds she has released.  I think if they would quit computerizing her voice...it would actually sound better....if they would just let her sing.<br />My favorite songs on the cd are:  Slave, Lonely, Boys (a total Janet rip-off but still fun), Anticipating, Let Me Be and What It's Like to be Me.   <br />If you want a fun and mindless cd, then pick this one up.
B00003CXE6|5.0|Russell Crowe definately deserved the Oscar for this wonderful film.  He was certainly convincing as a gladiator on the warpath after his wife and son are killed on orders from the ruthless Commodus.  This movie has you on edge from beginning to end especially during the many fight scenes.  For me, the most emotional scene was at the end when Maximus dies.  A tear-jerker!
B00005NWM3|4.0|I bought this cd after havin heard &quot;How You Remind Me&quot; and this cd was awesome.  The song &quot;Too Bad&quot; was also cool.  Nickelback is just as good as Creed, but they don't measure up to Staind.  They are good though, so buy this cd.
B00003CXRP|2.0|The name 'Tom Hanks' had me expecting another 'Gump', 'Private Ryan' etc. so I was very disappointed after viewing this movie.  It was your typical stranded on a desert island story.  Man loves girl, man gets stranded on desert island, man is found in sea by boat, man has lost girl.  The only 'cute' difference in this movie was the many tools that the castaway invented from the various things he found in unopened Fed Express packages.  The most noticable being 'Wilson' the basketball who Tom befriends from utter boredom.  I love Tom Hanks movies but this one wasn't as entertaining as his previous blockbusters.  Still, it's worth watching at least once.
B00005OM4N|5.0|(...) As in spear's fashion she covered someone else's hit,particularly joan jett's i love rock n' roll,this time with a little more rock flair.though people dismiss her once again,saying she could never be the madonna and that she's still too bugglegum,don't realize that it took many years for madonna's music to be viewed as art from the public and that btitney has time to perfect. Meanwhile this album shows where is in her life<br />and i say it's a hit.
B0000541AM|4.0|I remember seeing this film when I was a lot younger--maybe two or three years after it was released--and thinking it was simply a great, simplistic story with good action scenes.  Growing up, the film hasn't dated as much as it might have, simply because of it's pace, editing, and charisma.<br />All of the actors do a great job, even if some of the dialogue is of its day--but James Remar as 'Ajax' and Michael Beck's 'Swan' are particular stand-outs as the typical street hood with a chip on his shoulder, and the disillusioned, somewhat idealistic gang leader, respectively.<br />The romance in the film is realistic, but of secondary importance, and the bathroom fight scene in the last third of the movie is very impressive.  The score of the film sounds exactly like the year it was released, but suits the mood to a 'T.'
0767825411|4.0|When this movie came out it became an instant classic and  while I am not sure if todays' sophisticated kids would enjoy it as much as I and my younger brothers did, it is a good solid comedy with a well written script and is very entertaining.  Murray is just plain funny and enjoyable to watch, and here he has an on screen romance budding with Sigourney Weaver.  I've noticed that any film with the name &quot;Ramis&quot; attached to it is good, and here he co writes and acts and the result is fun.<br />My favorite scene is when Murray shows up at Weaver's apartment to check it out for any &quot;paranormal&quot; indicators and he plays the part as if he doesn't really believe what it is he is doing, but the gig is a gig and he plays along.  He goes to the piano and taps the keys playing some classic black and white horror movie notes and then looks seriously at Weaver saying &quot;They hate it when you do that&quot;.  Somehow he can play the part of playing the part and does it convincingly.  Later in &quot;The Man Who Knew Too Little&quot;, Murray takes this kind of role to an art form, playing a character playing a character well enough to pull off some serious laughs.<br />Ghostbusters is a strong recommendation and is sure to entertain.
B000003N7K|5.0|I've been sitting here reading fellow Amazon reviewers take on \\"John Coltrane and Johhny Hartman\\" and I've noticed a trend that I find discomforting....if not exactly true as well. But I'll soon get to that. First, I think a little background is needed to fully understand where this cd is at, musically speaking of course. <br />When approached to do an \\"album\\" with a singer Cotrane's first, and I suspect only response, was Johnny Hartman. Hartman was close to being a complete unknown in a field where he so obviously excelled and Coltrane, while recording two albums of ballads previous to this record, \\"Ballads\\" and \\"Duke Ellington and John Coltrane\\" was still attempting to facillitate a style that reached the outer boundaries of the restrictive nature of popular song. That being the case they entered the studio and preceded to record a classic...in every sense of the word. <br />Now,unlike other reviewer's comments about Coltrane being subjected to the role of \\"sideman\\" to Johnny Hartman's vocals this, I feel, simply misses the point of what this cd is about. Coltrane's tenor, I feel, is actually the \\"second voice\\" on this fine disc. The interaction between voice and musical instrument will always be debated as how to best draw a \\"focal point\\" where each can draw inspiration from the other and I feel that this is as close as I've ever heard to having those two seperate entities actually realizing that one precise point where vocals and intrumentation blend together in perfect unison . A perfect blending of two \\"instruments\\". Obviously a listener's attention will always turn toward the vocal aspect of any piece of music due to it's simply being recorded at the front end of any song. And being Johnny Hartman how could you not pay close attention! But, if you truly listen to when Coltrane enters each song, a prime example being \\" Lush Life\\", than you may have an idea as to what I am saying. Coltrane's saxophone isn't so much accompanying Hartman as much as \\"singing\\" with him. I suspect this is the closest thing we may have to an actual \\"duet\\" regarding voice and musical accompiantment. While it's true that Coltrane did go back into the studio at a later date to overdub some phrases for \\"My One And Only Love', \\"Lush Life\\" and \\"You Are Too Beautiful\\" basicallly what you have here is recorded \\"live\\". Which only enhances the sheer \\"magic\\" of this disc! <br />And speaking of accompiantment isn't it time to give credit to McCoy Tyner, Jimmy Garrison and Elvin Jones. Without these fine musicians I suspec this cd would surely lose some of it's lustre! A truly first rate quartet that is second only to Mile's work on \\"Kinda Blue\\". <br />So, in the end, purchase your own copy of \\"Coltrane/Hartman\\" and hear what all the fuss is about. Whether you agree with my observations or not this cd is simply too good to pass up. Simple, beautiful and terribly romantic! Actually, forget all this superficial analyzing and enjoy the disc for what it is....Simply Wonderful!
6302820448|5.0|This movie can be watched over again without getting bored and often with finding a little bit that missed detection the last time.  It is extremely clever and one of Murrays' best films, perhaps second only to &quot;What about Bob?&quot;.  Murray finds himself caught in an endless loop, waking up to the same day over and over.  Finding out that he can spend endless time practicing the piano, trying to get MacDowell to fall for him or just learning personal bits of information about the townspeople.  The results are very funny and while we never quite learn how long actually passes during the film, i.e. How many days does he live in this loop?, we never quit rooting for Murray to figure it all out and get the girl.<br />The film editing in this movie is excellent, we watch as Murray gets slapped, slapped again, slapped over and over till finally he starts to learn a little bit about treating others and avoids the slap, only to make another gross mistake and have to learn the next lesson.  Never slow, this romantic comedy (with a little bit about life in general thrown in) is a very strong recommendation.
0385505833|5.0|Builds up nicely and kept me entertained for a couple of hours. Nice change of pace. Fits in with everyone's life this time of year. Recommend highly. Thank you Mr. Grisham for something nice that made me feel good. It is funny that every year we think about dropping out of Christmas and the family and friends all  have a fit. Someday maybe we will be brave.
B00003CX5P|5.0|I really don't understand all of the bad things that everyone has said about this movie.  Personally I thought it was great.  Better than Star Wars... incredibly better than Jedi... and just as good as The Empire Strikes Back, my favorite entry in the original series.  Granted, it's not perfect but the positives outweigh the negatives here...<br />Pluses:<br />Jake Lloyd does an excellent job as young Anakin.  Back when the film was first released, I read an article that said that that little annoying elfin lad Haley Joel Osment was considered for this role.  I'm so glad Lucas chose this kid instead.  Lloyd is charming and likable as the future Darth Vader.<br />Liam Neeson, Ian McKellen, Ewan McGregor, and Natalie Portman are also fine in their roles. Ray Park(s) (aka Darth Paul) was also a great addition to the ensemble.  However, his talents were mostly used in fight sequence and just looking completely sinister.<br />I also liked all of the little pieces of continuity and history that are in the film. We see how C3PO and R2D2 meet... a young Yoda... a young Greedo... just what Emperor Palpatine was before he became the Emperor... and we even get to see a young Jabba the Hutt and Bibfortuna, too!<br />Finally, the special effects are awesome.  Lucas outdid himself here.  I sat there in awe for the entire duration of the movie.  No other film has ever had that kind of effect on me.<br />But there also a few negative spots, too:<br />Samuel L. Jackson wasn't used as much as he should've been.<br />Jar Jar Binks annoyed the bejesus out of me.<br />No Wookiees.  There should've been at least ONE Wookiee in the movie dagnabbit!  :)<br />All in all, it's a great movie and I recommend it to fans of science fiction and Star Wars.  If you haven't seen it, get this DVD now and enjoy!  You won't be disappointed!
B00005QK3W|4.0|Paul can't win. If he does ballads, he's considered lightweight and without substance. If he makes up stories, his lyrics aren't heartfelt. If he doesn't rock, he's a wimp. Geez!<br />If this record was done by Sting, everybody would be raving. It's just that Paul McCartney will always be measured up to, well, Paul McCartney!<br />I really like his new band, and the overall sound. The bass playing is excellent and inspired, and the songs are good. My favorites are &quot;About You,&quot; &quot;She's Giving Up Talking,&quot; &quot;Lonely Road,&quot; and the haunting &quot;From A Lover To A Friend.&quot;
B00005N9CV|2.0|I am an avid Diana Krall fan. I have all of her discs (imports included) and have seen her in concert three times. As much as I think she's the greatest thing to happen to jazz vocals since Peggy Lee, I've got to let her know that this latest path in the road she's taken is not the one to stay on. She sounds tired and uninspired - which I'm sure she is knowing the demanding schedule she keeps. It's overproduced and each song is sung in the same key. I enjoy her singing on the holiday Target commercials more than this disc. Go back to your roots Diana, and don't let the demand for your fabulous music lower your standards to get it out there by any means necessary.
B0000508U6|4.0|This cd is so forgettable, except for the song Trouble.
B00005Q66T|5.0|Sure, the edits aren't the greatest, it's missing a few great songs, and any Madonna fan already owns all the songs (I do), but it's Madonna, and any new CD from the Queen of Pop is something that everybody needs to buy. Even if she's not your favorite, owning the Immaculate Collection and GHV2 gives you a total Greatest Hits collection from Madonna.

B00000JMOF|4.0|This seminal horror film features many elements that would later become cliches (ie, rioting villagers with torches, burning windmills, insane dwarf assistants).  Although nearly unrecognizable beneath what is arguably the most famous make-up job of all time, Boris Karloff managed to give such a distinctive performance that it made a star of him.  His monster remains touching even today.  The face-off between him and his creator, Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive), in the abandoned windmill is still frightening.  Nobody who has any affection for old movies and the horror genre can fail to enjoy the world that this film presents, with its dark graveyards, forboding castles, and shadow-haunted mountains, all presented in glorious black and white.

B000056V73|1.0|This movie, if we can call it that, is absolutely, totally, reprehensibly pathetic on all accounts. Seeing the plethora of positive reviews here makes me almost lose my faith in mankind. This movie is to films what britney spears is to music, what pink donuts are to food, what the brady bunch is to tv. After enduring scene after scene of nauseating treacle I had to switch this video off, much to the applause of my fellow viewers.<BR> <BR>Everything in Almost Famous reeks of heavy handed sentimentality; how sweet it is when the groupie chick takes a shying to our what, 10 year old journalist protagonist? How poignant it is when billy crudup goes to the party and spends time with &quot;real people&quot;. How humorous it is when journalist boy speaks like a man over the phone. This, friends, is sarcasm.<br />The characterisations and plot are as about as thin and 2 dimensional as a goddamn soap opera. Beleive me, I love movies, and I know what a good movie is. I also know what a crowd-pleasing, multiplex filling, heart warming excuse for a film is. Almost Famous is just that. This movie is a glass of Coke, a Happy Meal, an icecream sundae, it's designed to go down easy. I can only imagine that the majority of reviewers for this film are slightly overweight women who wear disney pyjamas, drink hot cocoa at night, listen to bryan adams and destiny's child with alarming regulairty, and tape the repeats of party of five whilst they watch Friends.<br />If a movie as bad as this can get ratings and make as much money as good as this, then god help us all.
B00004XONN|2.0|2.5 stars<BR>---------<br />Radiohead is regarded as one of the best groups in rock history, and with good reason. &quot;The Bends&quot; was a great, melodic rock masterpiece with great singles like &quot;High and Dry,&quot; and an overall amazing album from end to end. Then came the extremely popular &quot;OK Computer&quot; in 1997, which is absolutely wonderful (it's SO popular that it may be a tad overrated); a concept album with enough melody and hooks to keep you hooked throughout the CD.<br />And then, predictably, Radiohead let success go to their head and turned from a very talented alternative band to abstract artists who are more interested in being recognized as musical geniuses and artists than entertainers.<br />I know so many Radiohead fans stuck by the band with this release, pointing out how well thought-out it is. But let me ask you this -- when you go to the store to buy a CD, why do you do so? Is it to purchase a wonderful piece of art that you can listen to for an hour, admiring it and thinking about how brilliantly arty it is? OR, is it to ENTERTAIN yourself?? I know some people may have enough time on their hands to spend an hour admiring a record, but I'm not one of them.<br />This album is artistic, but not entertaining. It is not very melodic, and moreover, it's so abstract and arty that you can't relate to the lyrics or the music. Please check out &quot;The Bends&quot; or &quot;OK Computer&quot; to discover the great Radiohead that everyone raves about.<br />As for the album, I do not own it, but have heard most of the songs. &quot;Optimistic&quot; is definitely my favorite, and actually is one of my favorite Radiohead songs of all musically. The rest are only interesting if you have time to sit around and &quot;interpret&quot; them -- I get enough of that ridiculous stuff in English class with poetry. I decided to give the album another chance and downloaded &quot;Everything In Its Right Place,&quot; only to find that it is annoying electronica that has incohenrent lyrics. If you're looking for a good, yet intelligent record to listen to, get the albums I mentioned, along with some other modern rock like Incubus and Creed.
B00005OWIU|4.0|Wow!  John Williams has done it again!  I LOVE Hedwig's Theme.  It is pretty much the theme throughout.  What I specifically like about this is that it promises development in later movies.  Especially in the Voldemort part.  Once book 4 becomes a movie, we should see a really powerful Voldemort's Theme.  We can also assume that the main theme played throughout will remain in the movie.  My only complaint for this whole CD is that there isn't really as diverse a range of music as some of John William's other scores, such as the Empire Strikes back; it is based pretty much around the same theme throughout.  This can get repetitive, or even boring in some cases.  However, this is still a FABULOUS CD!!
630521610X|5.0|Alot of people scream is funny and not scary.Well the begining is scary as hell. A teenage girl being harased on the phone and later chased through her house by a killer in a ghost mask. You may think: I've seen this before. But no. After the killer brings down the girl on her lawn he brutally stabs her. I'll never forget the backround music and how scary it was. After being stabbed teh girl kicks the killer down and tries to yel for help to her parents who are just enetering the house. The parents find the gutted boy friend and shatterd window and call 911. Only when the mother picks up the phone she can her her daugter being stabbed. Again the music horrifying. Running out of teh house the mother see's her daugther hanging from a tree, her insides on the outsides. And then on more teens are stalked but some end up more fortunate. There are some elements of comedy but don't let people tell you it's not scary. Just imagine being alone in your house and knowing a man in a grim reaper coustom is learking around with intentions to gut you. This movie scared the hell out of me and has always will haunt me.
B00005QK3W|4.0|A real delight from the macca. The Music flows from one piece to the next and never sounds stale or forced.<br />A real \\"tour de force\\" of varying styles and melodies and one sure to live in my Car CD player for quite while. Glad to hear that Paul still \\"has it\\".<br />Paul's voice sound a bit more controlled than his past few efforts, and not nearly as raw of strained.<br />The album itself has a certain \\"feel\\" to it that reminds me of the same feel evoked in Ram &amp; Wild Life.<br />While the album will not be the huge seller that it should be, it should fare quite well and I expect positive reviews.<br />I highly recommend to all fans of Paul and believe you will be pleased with the work.
0440133688|3.0|The HOUSE OF GOD was originally published in the 1970's when it was relatively more fashionable to throw eggs at anything that was \\"establishment\\". In this darkly humorous novel, the target is the U.S. medical profession - specifically, the training young physicians receive at the beginning of their careers.<br />We follow the education of Dr. Roy Basch during the year of his hospital internship in the HOUSE OF GOD after graduating from the Best Medical School. Almost immediately, he's introduced to the patient population that will be his nemesis - the Gomers (the acronym for Get Out of My Emergency Room). Gomers are geriatric, mentally disoriented, chronically ill, debilitated adults who get no better, yet never manage to die on their own. Dr. Roy can choose as a role model either the Fat Man or Jo, two second-year doctor-trainees (\\"residents\\"). The Fat Man's philosophy is to do nothing to treat the Gomers, while Jo will attempt every heroic procedure in the book. Paradoxically, Gomers get better, or at least remain stable, under the former regimen, but get worse and die under the latter. At the other end of the patient scale are those relatively young admissions that die tragically no matter what. After several months of experiencing this and exposure to the incompetence and/or mercenary greed of the private physicians on the hospital staff, Basch is sustained in this psychologically and professionally crushing environment only by the sex he has with Nurse Molly. Then, even that isn't enough, and Roy alienates his friends by becoming withdrawn, sarcastic, and obnoxious. Can our hero, all idealism now lost, be saved before he drops out or commits suicide?<br />Since the HOUSE OF GOD was authored by a physician, Samuel Shem, I give him the benefit of the doubt that his description of the dehumanizing experience that is a medical internship in a large, urban medical center is at least partly accurate. And, it is humorous, at least until the reader realizes that each one of us is a potential Gomer, at which point the plot becomes less cause for chuckles. God forbid that we should become victims of such medical malpractice as found within these pages.<br />The greatest failing of this novel in the year 2001 is that it's dated. In this age of AIDS, I would doubt that `terns\\" are nowadays as promiscuous as depicted. And, since many physicians are now not much more than salaried drones for the HMOs, the egotism of the medical profession as a whole is not quite the balloon to be popped that it once was.<br />As an alternative to Shem's novel, I would recommend the 1971 cinematic black comedy THE HOSPITAL, starring George C. Scott, since it touches on much the same themes. Scott is at his very best, and the movie can be viewed more quickly than this book can be read.  At 420 pages, the latter got a little tiresome.one of us is a potential Gomer, at which point the plot becomes less cause for chuckles.

B00000K19E|5.0|I bought the DVD version of the Matrix a while back and I still feel the excitment whenever I watch it. This isn't the greatest movie EVER, but it is still a good action-packed film. The DVD has a Menu where one can see the setting of the cameras, a few commentaries, an all-music commentary, and (this is creative) where one can set up a white rabbit to flash at the bottom of the screen at certain parts, leading on to show how those scenes were filmed. The plot of the movie is basically about Keanu Reeves's character (Neo) searching for an answer and finding the truth hidden in the secret world of the Matrix along with a crew of people &quot;freed&quot;, where as the crew are searching for the One. The film would have been more complete if the characters were a bit more developed and talkative instead of Laurence Fishburne doing most of it.  But don't let that discourage you, because this is a really well-played film. And yet it doesn't tear away from what the movie's theme is trying to tell you. <BR>This movie is great to own and the DVD version is best because of the extra information you can find which, for the bigger fans, is an extra bonus. In the end, the Matrix is really worthwhile.
0062502182|1.0|Reviewer: A reader from Germany <BR>This is a very shallow tale disguised as a deeply spiritual fable. Sorry. I know that it has helped many people to start on a spiritual journey (that's why it gets two stars not one) but that doesn't change things at all. Anyone with a gift for words could have created this story just by skimming through the world's mystical literature. If you want depth, go to the truly mystical works such as &quot;The Book of Mirdad&quot; (sadly out of print!) or any of the genuine msytics in any of the world religions - for example Ramana Maharshi, St Francis, the Sufi mystics, Zen masters. Or even the Bible, read with a an open mind. All have much more depth than the Alchemist. And of course the ending of this book was ridiculous. A material treasure is tinsel in comparison to the real spiritual treasure  - why then should this be shown to be the ultimate goal and fulfillment? It's a very dangerous premise put forward that spiritual wisdom will lead to material wealth - even if the material wealth is only a by-product.
B000050XEI|5.0|As a 16 yr. old who doesn't particularly like soft and mellow music, I found this CD to be very relaxing and pleasant; definitely a 5 star album.   After a hard day of school tensions and work, it's nice to sit back and relax to her unique and soothing voice.  It was everything I've been looking for to help me relieve my stress.  It also helps you clear your mind before going to sleep (for this I am particularly grateful).  The first track off of the album is my personal favorite.  An instrumental depiction of tranquility and enchantment, it seems to take you to a world with no problems, only serenity.  The only fault I have found with this album was the insufficient length.  Even though, it proved to be a wonderful album and has fulfilled my needs.  I think I have found a new favorite in music and hope that she has more releases in the future.
1558216847|5.0|this is one of the best books i have ever read. since then, i have probably bought ten copies to give to friends. if you think your commute to the job is stressful-read this.<BR>a pleasure to read in this age of whiney narratives.
B00000G3Q4|4.0|When I first saw this movie I thought I was gonna get the guts scared out of me. But instead I got some of the greatest laughs. The director made a pretty good movie out of such a (bad) plot. I think army of darkness (Evil Dead 3) was much better than this one. The gallons of blood was the thing that made this movie as good as it is. So you should gather your friends at midnight and get ready for some gore!
B00005Q66T|4.0|A fantastic collection of the biggest hits from Madonna's most recent CDs.  I would, however, have liked to see a few others added to the mix--particularly &quot;Rain&quot; and &quot;American Pie.&quot;  While the endless photographs in the booklet are spectacular, I found the liner notes themselves awful.  The author's poor attempt at humor ruins the whole package.  I would have enjoyed more photographs instead.
B000006OAM|5.0|This is one of the CDs that I must have with me.  The songs are beautiful and don't get old on repeated listenings.  My personal favorite is Life is Sweet(a good one to sing along to when you're alone in the car).  The whole CD, though, is wonderful.  Definitely recommended!
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Yes, this movie is as funny as it is brilliant, in every sense of the word. The movie in it self is great and the DVD-release is great too. You get everything, and more.<br />The one thing I don't understand is how people could confuse this movie for a kids movie. If you have a movie PACKED with jokes that aren't meant for children, and which children couldn't possibly understand, how can you reach this conclusion?<br />Anyways, the movie is great, and so are the actors. Eddie Murphy does an amazing job as Donkey, and Mike Meyers is wonderful as Shrek. The animation is amazing and packed with details. If you think the animation is anything short of fantastic, you should probably watch the movie again, and without that paper bag over your head.<br />Well, get it. I did, and I don't regret it.
B000002H2H|5.0|&quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; is yet another example of Metallica's legendary era.  This album is second only to &quot;Master of Puppets,&quot; which I rank as one of the best metal/hard rock albums ever.  Obviously, as this is Metallica, you will find powerful guitars and drums throughout.  Hetfield's singing is slightly different from MOP, but I still enjoy it,nonetheless.<br />The album begins with a great acoustic guitar line, lasting just over 30 seconds.  Then the electric devastation kicks into high-gear, hitting you with the aural force of a train wreck.  Thus, &quot;Fight Fire with Fire&quot; begins.  After that, six tracks of vehemence and melody demonstrate the best in thrash-metal music.  The album's closer, &quot;Call of K'tulu,&quot; which takes its name from an H.P. Lovecraft story, shows off the musical prowess of the entire band.  This instrumental is easily their best.  You have to hear it to know what I mean.<br />All in all, a great album.  Although Metallica's sound has changed over the years, this album is a testament to both the brutality and beauty of a by-gone era of heavy music.
B00005QK3W|4.0|Upon first listen I didn't really appreciate this highly anticipated release, being spoiled by Macca's brilliant melodies over the past 40 years. Even &quot;From A Lover To A Friend,&quot; a beautiful song, suffers from a weak middle eight. But on a second listen the tunes grow on you to the point where &quot;Lover,&quot; &quot;Your Loving Flame&quot; and &quot;I Do&quot; will go down as classic McCartney. And even on some of the more forgettable tunes Paul sounds like he did 35 years ago, quite a tribute to one of the greatest performers and composers in history. And any reservations I had about the album were wiped out by the addition of the live version of &quot;Freedom&quot; from the Concert for New York. This is a different Paul--more instrumental work, a return to the classic bass lines of Abbey Road and Pepper--but one who is not afraid to take chances. He sounds totally at ease and happy with the way his life is going, and it comes across in the almost carefree atmosphere that pervades the album. Overall, if not quite a triumph it's damn close.
B000056K04|3.0|Ok, I own about every other album by the Dave Mathews Band, and was eagerly awaiting this one, but I'm not gonna buy it.  What happened?  They hired some producer to improve something that didn't need any help.  Going from Under the Table and Dreaming to Crash to Before These Crowded Streets, one would think they'd just keep going up, then comes this.  For the next album they should just go back to what got them here.  Very disappointing.
B00005R2M3|5.0|(...) i think this cd is amazing and i'd highly recommend it.  the sounds are new and refreshing compared to the other trash that is currently on the radio.  it's encouraging to know that there are still true artists out there who can write their own lyrics and music.
B0000399WI|5.0|This is simply the gratest movie I have ever seen.  I enjoyed it because it is about so much more then just an innocent man going to prison.  My favorite line from the movie is &quot;Hope is a good thing maybe the best of things and no good thing ever dies.&quot;  That line sums up why I like this movie as much as I do.  The underlining moral of this film is the struggle for man kind to live the life that they have dreamed about.
0761536434|5.0|Combine Leonard Herman's accurate but dry Phoenix with the intimacy of David Sheff's Game Over and you've got The Ultimate History of Video Games, the best account of video game history to date. Numerous anecdotes from the people who made the games that made history--from Atari's Al Alcorn and Nolan Bushnell through to Square's Hironobu Sakaguchi and Sony's Kaz Hirai--give the book an personal, friendly tone. Gamers should note that this is a reprinted but noticably improved version of Kent's self-published The First Quarter, with a full index, more photographic examples, a more attractive layout, and the removal of all the confusing typos and minor errors (sadly, the original book's clever title was removed as well, but the amended facts are worth it). Ultimate History's conversational tone, broad scope, and authoritative direct quotes make it very compelling as a narrative but just as useful as a reference. Along with David Sheff's Game Over, it's an entertaining must-read for students of gaming history.
B00005ASIL|2.0|I (...) love Tull but loathe the remastering of this collection. This is another case of de-hissing sucking the life out of the music. (...)Have a listen to recent re-master's by Simon and Garfunkel or Pink Floyd to hear how spectacular older recording's can sound when re-mastered properly!!!
B00003CX8I|5.0|This film stars Hugh Jackman as the beloved comic book hero, Wolverine. There may have been some other people in the movie as well, I didn't really notice. Wait, I think there was a guy who shot laser beams out of his eyes; I noticed him because a couple of times he stood in front of Hugh Jackman, blocking my view.<br />  Seriously, this film does hail the first American appearance of what is surely a new star. As Wolverine, Jackman hits just the right notes of rage tempered with vulnerablity. Director Brian Singer deserves major kudos for channeling 40 years of best selling comic books into a comprehensible 2 hour movie, although much of the comic book mythology has been jettisoned. (Rogue, for example, has no prior history with either Mystique or Magneto.) Still, the spirit is here, and while the film occasionally bogs down a bit (everything to do with the bigoted senator is a bit of a snooze for me) it reenergizes whenever Jackman is on the screen, particularlly in his scenes with Rogue.<br />X-Men 2 is in the works, and those who have read the script say it will be better than the first installment. With appearances by NightCrawler and Pyro, it looks like we will have many satisfying sequels to this unexpected gem.
B00005NEZ3|1.0|save your money it's not worth it the only song worth listening too is CLINT EASTWOOD so just get the single
B00004BZ0N|5.0|Sure, there are the obvious great bands (ie. Beatles, Rolling Stones, etc.) but in my view, no band has influenced pop music and been more inclusive than The Clash!  And on London Calling, you can find all the sounds you want from reggae, to rockabilly to soul all tastefully blending together by the powerful energy of rock's most soulful rhythm sections on each song,with substantive lyrics more relevant today than ever, and melodies that are still fresh in my mind for 20 years now(yikes!). With songs like Revolution Rock, Lost In the Supermarket, London Calling, Lovers Rock, I can go on and on...the Clash to me is one of the 80's greatest moments, that took punk rock to the mainstream, and influenced great bands like U2, yet spawned bad imitations like Green Day. If you're here because you want to find out more about rock and refine your taste, London Calling is a must have.
B00005QK3W|1.0|Just can't agree with the other reviews.. Being one of Paul's biggest fans since day one, and have followed his musical career, I just can't see why people think this ablum is so great! It was put together in 5 weeks..Okay, fair enough.. The actual album is all about his new found love of his life, Heather, and nothing wrong with that.. But really, I did expect something more melodic, poppy, and a few more catchy tunes than the title track Driving Rain.. It sounds, rough, and out of tune..The only track thats really worth anything is &quot;Freedom&quot; - and with his stature could surely offer more to the 9/11 Relief Fund than one song. Whatever happened to the magic in his albums like, Back to the Egg (a total Masterpiece, Venus and Mars, and even Ram! I think Paul, you are running out of steam. I love all your work, and everything that you have done.. But Driving Rain drives me mad, because you can do su much better..What a shame.
B00005NWRS|5.0|Every now and again, I'll pick up some random cd, throw it in the player, and within a moment give up on it. I think maybe it was fate when I randomly picked up Heartbreaker from the local library and graciously drowned in the genuis that is Ryan Adams. I figure that anyone who writes angst songs containing &quot;Come pick me up..steal my records&quot; has my heart. My next adventure was to get my hands on anything about my new songwriting hero. For I had found someone who writes the way I've always wanted to write. I bought Gold, amazed to find out that it was a new release, for it came out a week after my &quot;discovery&quot;! &quot;Oh the night here it comes again/Off with the jeans the jacket and the shirt&quot; I highly recommend &quot;La Ciegna Just Smiled&quot;, &quot;New York, New York&quot;, and (an ode to my hero) &quot;Silvia Plath&quot;. <BR>However my favorite part about this particular album is Ryan's varied stylings. I have never seen such change in ONE album. Of course, it is THE LONGEST album I've ever known of. For instance, &quot;Harder Now that It's Over&quot; sounds so much like Neil Young it scares me. This ablum is simply fantastic. <BR>So if you're sick of everything out there, BUY THIS ALBUM! BUY THIS ALBUM period! And then buy Heartbreaker, and all of his Whiskeytown releases.<BR>For the past month, Ryan Adams has been my greatest source of inspiration. Songwriters: if that song is just not coming out the way it should, pop in an Adams cd and you'll be signing publishing contracts faster than you can say the word <BR>P-R-O-L-I-F-I-C!
B00004X01U|4.0|I commend Madonna for her ongoing spirit and personality. She's carried herself well over the years, raising 2 beautiful children, getting married (for good, hopefully), while still maintaining her reseliance and tremendous wheel-barrel of success. Even when people were criticizing her for her open sexuality and expressivness she kept her head held high and didn't give a royal (...)about what other's thought, and she let them know it. So with that attitude she's resulted in becoming one of the biggest and - even into her 40s now - one of the hottest singers to grace the charts...<br />Ray Of Light still withstands the favorite slot while Music barely scathes it, but it's more electronic feel mixed in with dance pop is still quite tasty, it just needs some getting used to. Much like all of her CDs it sounds completely different from the one before, and next to Sarah Brightman she's the queen of reinvention...<br /><br />Upon first listen I confess to feeling slightly confused and disappointed. I thought the length of the album and songs to be too short (which I still do) and ... well... it just didn't live up to my expectations, I guess. I'm unsure of the problem. The point is that I now love it. It's laden with heavy dance beats that I can't seem to get enough of. What can I say? I'm hopelessly an addict for Madonna.<br />Favorite songs include Music (which I recommend playing very loud), Impressive Instant, Nobody's Perfect, Paradise (Not For Me, which is somewhat sung in French), and Gone, which I hope is not a closing testament.
B00003CXXJ|1.0|lots of toilet humor, sexual inuendo, etc... at first glance this appears to be a kid's movie but you may not be happy about everything this movie tries to put in your kid's head.

B00000IO4I|5.0|Recently, I had the pleasure of viewing this delightful film at home...Michael Caine, Brenda Blethyn (Oscar nominee) and Jane Horrocks delivered splendid performances.<br />The joy of this production, in my book, is Ms. Horrocks, who so brilliantly captures the role of a hopeless introvert whose only means of expression is by singing like the great divas (Bassey, Garland, Monroe, and so on).  I caught her guest spot on the &quot;Parkinson&quot; talk show last week, singing a track from her follow-up CD &quot;Further Adventures of Little Voice&quot; (a la Bassey, no less)! <br />I can't wait to include &quot;Little Voice&quot; in my video library, and I wish the above-mentioned CD (released in the UK) would be available in the US as well.  Great film!!!
B00005QK3W|4.0|thank you mr. mccartney.. i needed this.  i needed an actual attempt at making music.. instead of making money.. or racking up the kiddie sales records..<br />this may not be my favorite cd/record by paul mccartney.. but i'm glad i bought it.. i like most of the songs.. and would recommend it to others.. and, actually.. have done so..<br />it's a bit different than what i expected.. perhaps that's why i'm not insanely in love with each song.. yet..<br />but that's a GOOD thing.. make me think.. make me listen to it a thousand times.. make me decided if i like it.. don't tell me in a slick commercial on mtv.. that i have to like it<br />good record.. honest record.. worth the price

0385505833|4.0|I think it's safe to say we all experience the overwhelming feelings that Christmas and the holidays bring. Not just the excitement, but the dread of shopping, spending money, putting up decorations, etc. I have often wanted to skip it all myself and almost did last year when I was on bedrest during pregnancy. But my traditions got the best of me. (My husband was not happy about all the work he had to do as I instructed him from my bed!) This book deals with a subject that many are too afraid to admit. But in the end, what really matters is family, friends and being together. Very amusing story that really hits home!
0553212087|5.0|Is it my obsession with Jane Austen or do the sisters in Howards End really have many things in common with those in Sense and Sensibility? We have the eldest, governing in the family and also carrying the burden of her unshared knowledge -derived from a mixture of wisdom, fairness and compassion-; and we have the youngest, whose actions are ruled by impulse and who therefore is wrong although she means well. There is also symbolism, so dear to the modernist fiction, which doesn`t prevent the author from building round, absolute characters that sound like real life. I was very amused by E.M.Foster's worry with globalization -which he calls &quot;cosmopolitanism&quot;- as a tendency opposed to those who want to keep England as close to its origins as possible -i.e. the author himself; actually, the whole novel and its symbolism revolve around this worry.In short, the two sisters sound very much like those in Sense and Sensibility, but E.M.Foster's intention is more intellectual, less social or ethical than that of Jane Austen's
B00003CXQX|5.0|Yes, maybe I am a little too old for Disney. Maybe I shouldn't spend my lunch period quoting the Emperor's New Groove and Monty Python with my friends. But still, I think that everyone who has seen this movie likes it. Little kids like it cos it's funny, older kids (yeah!) like it cos it's funny. Most adults like it cos it's funny. Also, it has a good message and is cute too. It's a great movie for family get-togethers cos little kids think it's a funny movie and love it cos their elders also enjoy it. Okay, maybe your wondering about my sanity. In 7th grade and still collect disney stuff. But this is def. one of my favorite movies (well, there is also a Knights Tale cos the gut is soo hot, but we're speaking strictly cartoons right now)
B000001G16|5.0|This C.D. Is excellant, it is a most for all Bon Jovi fans. Ballard Of Youth and Father Time are out of this world and very well writen.  Buy this C.D. twice, because you'll be sure to wear out the first copy.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|This movie is hilarious! I laughed so hard! You'll love Eddy Murphy as the donkey- he is soo cute and funny. All age groups will love it- from kids to adult.
6300263673|3.0|Okay, okay. I'll admit it. I kinda like this movie. I wouldn't of done it if my niece didn't make me. Anyways, here we go. Jennifer Grey(who doesn't look anything like her old self today)stars as Baby. Her parents and sister and her go to a nice resort up in the Catskills. There, Baby meets Johnny(Patrick Swayze). They begin a romance. I'm not being too insightful 'cause I haven't seen it in eons. There are some rather serious moments that deal with timely issues. Jerry Orbach from &quot;Law And Order&quot; plays Baby's father, and Kelly(Gilmore Girls)Bishop is her mother. I have to admit that the end climax is pretty fun and a memorable moment. The film has some nice set pieces and an outstanding soundtrack. I'm not ashamed to say that I have the soundtrack and have had it since it came out in 1987. The movie spawned a horrid spin-off T.V. series that, thanksfully, didn't last long. The acting on all fronts is pretty darn decent. You heard me. I said 'Darn'. It's a nice, little romantic drama that's pleasant entertainment.
B00005QK3W|1.0|I'm not sure what other people have been listening to, but it can't be the same Paul McCartney album I just bought.  Maybe I've got a defective copy of DRIVING RAIN.  The one I've been listening to sounds like Paul rushed into some California studio with a no-name rookie band and recorded 15 very forgettable tracks.  Most of the lyrics are more trite and shallow than he usually writes.  In fact, many of them sound like they were made up on the spot while recording them!  I mean &quot;1,2,3,4,5,let's go for a drive&quot;?  C'mon, this isn't supposed to be a kid's song like &quot;All Together Now&quot; was for &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;.  To me, the band sounds flat and very un-polished.  I like a harder edge as much as anyone, but there has to be some substance there.  These guys sound like they're just learning the ropes.  And where are the usual magical McCartney melodies?  These songs seem to ramble on with very little structure.  Of course, the most painful thing for me to listen to is poor Paul trying over-sing on several of the tracks.  At 59, he has to admit he doesn't quite have the range he used to.  Yet, there he is still trying to belt out the words like he was singing &quot;Long Tall Sally&quot; in the mid-sixties.  Ouch, it just doesn't work anymore.  He still has a very beautiful voice, but he needs to learn to tailor it properly to the tunes he's writing.  I guess I'll file this one with Paul's other &quot;experimental&quot; albums (i.e. &quot;McCartney II&quot;, &quot;Press To Play&quot;).  Thank goodness he tacked &quot;Freedom&quot; on at the end.  It's not great, but it's better than the rest of the album.  Hopefully, Paul will come up with a more polished production next time.  Let's hope we don't have to wait another four years to hear it.
B00005NWM3|5.0|This record only opens Nickelback as a bigger and badder band from the great white north (Canada).  They help to prove that more can come from Canda than just Tom Green, Jim Carrey and the Kids in the Hall.  I've been following Nickelback back since just before their release of &quot;The State&quot; and in my opinion they've only gotten better.  Their 3 records (&quot;The Curb&quot; was only released in Canada) have evolved and their chops have become more broad.  I love it.  For any fan of the band this is just another great record to add to the collection.
B000000OF6|4.0|Queen is one of my all time favorite groups, so it's no surprise that I really love this collection of songs.  It also fixes up the mess created by Hollywood Records when they released &quot;Classic Queen&quot; and then &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;.<br />One problem I do have with this collection is that I prefer the full versions of &quot;Fat Bottomed Girls&quot; and &quot;Hammer To Fall&quot; over the single versions that appear on this collection.  And why were other songs like &quot;Under Pressure&quot; and &quot;I'm Going Slightly Mad&quot; chopped up as well?  The other problem I have with this collection is that it's missing &quot;Tie Your Mother Down&quot; and &quot;Keep Yourself Alive&quot; (the only thing that Hollywood did right was include them on &quot;Classic Queen&quot;).<br />Putting those two things aside, I would recommend anyone who wants to get into Queen's music to start with this 2 CD set.
B00005NWRS|4.0|Because he shows such promise, it seems churlish to complain about Ryan Adam's Gold.  But ambition ain't achievement, and though he'll no doubt get there, he ain't there yet.  That said, Gold is a mighty fine, derivative work.  In his defense, Adams is a stellar writer - whatever the genre he's working over, he's passionate and focussed - and, more importantly, he's a limber singer who adapts to the style of the moment.  His rockers rock; his ballads are direct and moving.  Problem is synthesis - as each track goes by, you tick off the antecedents:  Stones-rip, Who anthem, Van Morrison stroll, Elton John love tune, with the rare track that feels completely his own.  Other problem is length:  16 songs, 5 more on extra disc, and it's too much of a good thing.  Once again, less is more.
B00005QK3W|2.0|Two times through and I'm disapointed. Like &quot;I Do&quot;, love &quot;Heather&quot;, and think that &quot;Freedom&quot; should be on radio hourly, but that's about it. No &quot;Flaming Pie&quot;, and that's not as good as &quot;Flowers&quot;, and that's not what &quot;Tug&quot; was.<br />I love Paul, and &quot;Run Devil Run&quot;. More covers? More colaberations-Paul Simon, James Taylor? Something must be done.<br />Am I nuts to want &quot;All My Lovin'&quot; again?
B00005Q45W|4.0|When the apocalypse finally comes, it won't sound like bombs bursting in air or any of those hoary old cliches.  It's going to sound a lot like the conspiratorial confessions of Leonard Cohen:  creamy smooth whisperings that soothe and attack in equal measure.  On Ten New Songs, Cohen, recently back from a monastery, contemplates birth/school/work/death with eerie calm.  On his 60's work, when he was in his 30's, he sounded weary.  He's beyond that now, a voice reporting from the grave.  His old folk settings have been replaced by cocktail electronica.  The tinkling faux-jazz and r&amp;b lite never distract from the grit of the songs.  When he talks about \\"cardboard and piss\\" on \\"Here It Is\\", you can smell it.  When \\"Love Itself\\" visits him, and deserts him then in \\"Alexandra Leaving\\", you first feel the warmth of new love and then, as he describes that eternal moment of parting, you feel a chill like never before.
B00005R2M3|4.0|This CD is certainly worth buying, but for old-time Shakira fans, don't expect the same quality of lyrics as those in<BR> &quot;Donde estan los ladrones?&quot;. For me, the only track that really dissapointed was &quot;Eyes like yours&quot; (&quot;Ojos asi&quot;). I doesn't flow so well as the Spanish version. <br />The best songs for me are: Fool, Poem to a horse and Underneath your clothes.

6305949972|5.0|This is a great movie.  The stop-motion animation is very well done, the storyline is new and interesting, the music is wonderful and some of it catchy, and the characters are awesome.  I am speechless! Hehe.  I love the style of this movie.. the talent that went into making it blows my mind.  Stop-motion that good.. that is hard stuff!  I also recommend the soundtrack for this film!<br />I love this movie for a couple of my main reasons for loving anything.. 1) it takes you to a captivating world that is both familiar and new, and 2) the characters are lovable!  Perhaps lovable is the wrong word in this case.. but they are interesting and easy to like.  Though the characters aren't incredibly deep they are unique and fascinating.<br />Jack Skellington strikes me as two things, a very admirable guy with extreme talent, confidence, and ability, and under all that as well as under his scary demeanor, he has a good heart.  You have to admire a guy with so many facets who ALSO can survive a direct hit from an anti-aircraft cannon, leap with dazzling speed through sets of twirling knives, and of course, work those 'ghost-like charms' to their fullest extent..
B00002MZ2C|3.0|After all the hype surrounding the album...<BR>After the album going multiplatinum...<BR>After releasing two incredible singles and one okay one...<BR>I finally decided to get it. I love \\"Sleep Now In The Fire,\\" a rocking, fast-paced tune with a good message, excellent guitar, and good rapping. I also think \\"Guerilla Radio,\\" with its awesome Guitarmonica solo, is a cool track. \\"Testify,\\" a remotely heavy song, also caught my attention. Here's the catch...Those three are the only standouts on the whole CD! All the other songs are not that great. I anticipated getting this album for a long time, and was disappointed. Listen to those three songs, because I think they're the only good ones. I give it three stars-One for each good song. Maybe some other RATM albums are better? I surely hope so. (...)

B00005QIPH|5.0|I stumbled onto the Strokes watching the video Last Nite. I liked it right away. I dig their stlye, they are just kicked back and nonchalant with the way they play and the way Julian Casablancas sings. His voice is grainy and ironical and is reminiscent of Mick Jagger. They have great energy and the album is a good ride.

B00005JKG9|5.0|This is one great flick!  A must see for anyone who is involved in, or deals with sales (or has in the past).  I have never experienced a movie that delves so deeply into the personal lives and challenges of salesmen, and there are some stellar performances here.  In particular, Alec Baldwin's scene!<br />It is a sin that this is not out on DVD yet!!!
B00003CY0U|3.0|This movie has action, suspense, plot twists, computer hacking, and John Travolta.  So, how can it miss?  Perhaps by overdoing the action, suspense, plot twists, etc. etc., it becomes almost a parody of the genre.  But, if you like that sort of thing, suspend your disbelief for 90 minutes and enjoy!  Travolta's character is a badguy/goodguy who thinks that the ends justify the means.  In his supposed quest to defend his country he resorts to mayhem, murder, extortion, and any other tool which will support his goals.  He hires a convicted computer hacker to transfer a large amount of money to support his activites and lures him into working for him by promising him custody of his 10-year-old daughter, who lives with his ex-wife.  Most of the plot is pretty unbelievable, but things sort themselves out and a little plot twist at the end leaves you scratching your head.
B00005OM4N|5.0|&quot;Britney&quot; is the third CD of Britney Spears and very different from her previous works. First of all, because Britney has become more aware of her career and also more mature. All the songs featured in this CD lead to one conclusion: Britney is becoming a woman, a new madonna, a singer who will reinvent herself to keep in the public eye. <br />The first single, &quot;I'm a slave 4 U&quot; is being played everywhere and is appreciated even for those who dislike britney. It is an unusual song, mixing afro beats with R&amp;B. Maybe it's a new music tendency, who knows?<br />The best ballad she has released, so far, is &quot;Not a girl, not yet a woman&quot; composed by Dido and which will surely become a hit single when Brit's upcoming movie, &quot;Crossroads&quot;, is released.       <br />&quot;Overprotected&quot; is a potential single, and shows that Britney does not want to live isolated, protected by relatives, producers, security guards. She just wants to have fun like any other 20 year old girl.<br />&quot;Boys&quot; and &quot;Anticipating&quot; are really good. Billboard magazine critics liked &quot;Boys&quot;, which reminds me of janet jackson's songs. <br />This CD is good and it worths your money.
0060934913|3.0|The book is somewhat well written, it jumps around a lot and is hard to follow.  What comes from the book is that Bourdain should be dead because of the excesses of youth, he thinks virtually all chef's are hacks except himself. He is very jealous of those that have surpassed his talents and have succeeded without having to Drop Acid, Snort Coke and a multitude of other sins. He gives some sound advice, but truthfully, most of it is sound and very little is advice.  But, the book reads fast and I did laugh a number of times. So I would recommend it to someone who is not easily offended and wants a peak into the Kitchen of a Mad Man......
B000003S0K|5.0|I bought the album in 1973 and was amazed by how great this is,all these years later I still think this is his best work,along with Tiger Mountain. and it seems to only get better with age.A GROUNDBREAKING RECORD.
B000059T1E|5.0|This along with the live Welcome to the Canteen are my favorite Traffic CD's. Barleycorn is one Traffic jazzy blues rock jam after another and has a momentum and overall feel that is perfect for summer days.Its accentuated by the Barleycorn ballad and the thoughtful and irresistable Empty Pages. The first two Traffic albums garner a lot of deserved attention. They are good and contain great moments but both CD's high points have an almost equal amount of low points, mundane period trapped stuff, psychedelic throwaways. Barleycorn on the other hand is not psychedlic and thus doesn't feel dated at all. Those first two also have a sequestered in the studio feel and are self-consciously competing with Beatle studio mastery. Barleycorn is a CD made for the open air and its freed up format lets all that creative energy (and this band had talent to burn) stretch out and fully come alive. And anyone who has seen them live knows Traffic finds its true form as a jam band.  If you love sixties psychedelic pop albums stick with those first two but if you love to hear a band play get the blues-jazz-rock jam laden Barleycorn.Like many bands Traffic also went through different phases, Barleycorn I believe is Traffic at its most listenable and enduring.  And if you can find it also get Welcome to the Canteen(containing live Dear Mr. Fantasy, Dave Mason's Sad and Deep as You, Medicated Goo, Gimme Some Lovin etc...) which along with Barleycorn will give you an afternoons worth of great music.

B00004XONN|5.0|Down by the river there's a neighbourhood of hutments where the gentle monkeys live, surviving off whatever scraps they can salvage that come flittering off the highway. Half-eaten hamburgers, including the paper wrap and the small green corrugated pickle slices. It's a sad life, and the generations that have lived off the river tell stories as old as the hydro plant upstream. They know not how to write, though they have the opposable thumbs to do it. Sadly, it is their itty-bitty brains that fail them in this small task. So their history is told orally, and the lives of their elders become the lives of the young, and so on.
0451204530|2.0|The Third Twin was the beginning of Ken Follett's descent into mediocrity. The Hammer of Eden continued his decline. Code to Zero cemented it. It has trite diaglogue, is badly edited, lacks the detail of works like Eye of the Needle and The Key to Rebecca, and just plain stunk. The pages were double-spaced to make the book reach its required page length. One of the things I've most loved about his books was his ability to write vulnerable male characters and strong female characters. His characters were so thinly drawn as to be caricatures. Unless he goes back to being the writer he used to be, he's lost me. I doubt I will ever read him again.
B00005NNT1|5.0|The story of &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; is an enchanting, experimental romp with animation.  At the time of its release, in December of 1937, Walt Disney was taking a heavy, financial risk with this movie.  Film goers were used to watching short animated films, like &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot;, starring Disney creation, Mickey Mouse.  However, what was yet to be known was ... would audiences sit through an hour and a half cartoon?<br />The story itself is simple enough.  A wicked queen, vane in every respect, has but one sinister ambition.  That being to be &quot;the most beautiful of all&quot;.  Every day she asks her mirror, &quot;Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the most fairest of them all?&quot;.  One day, however, the mirror answers, &quot;Snow White&quot; as the most fairest.  Outraged that there is another person more beautiful than her, she orders a huntsman to find Snow White, and kill her.  He obeys this command up until a point.  After taking her deep into the forest, he has seconds thoughts, tells Snow White what the queen wanted him to do, and pleads with her to escape, which she does. <br />Snow White meets up with seven dwarfs, who initially have no interest in her, nor her imposing ways.  The dwarfs are bachelors, of sorts; at least, living in the manner of a bachelor.  They are dirty and unkemp, as is their home.  Snow White gets them to clean up and live more respectfully; a rough task in the beginning, and much despised by the dwarfs.  However, she grown on them, and soon they come to respect her.<br />Meanwhile, the queen discovers Snow White is still alive.  Finding out where she is, the queen disguises herself as an old hag, and goes in search of her.  In her possession she carries an apple ... a poisonous apple with which she intends to give to Snow White to eat.  While the dwarfs are out working, Snow White encounters the queen, and is given the apple.  After taking one bite, she falls to the ground, dead, unable to be revived and brought back to life but by &quot;love's first kiss&quot;.  Eventually a prince comes along, as is the custom in fairy tales, and kisses Snow White, bringing her back to life.  What happens to the queen is an entirely different matter indeed.<br />So is a short synopsis of &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;.  However, problems evolved in the making of &quot;Snow White&quot;.  Based on a Grimms Bros. fairy tale, there was not enough material to make it into a film version, and Dinsey wondered how he could make an animated feature length film, and still keep the audiences attention.  He also wondered what he could do to offset the horror in the film.  &quot;Snow White&quot;, after-all, dealt with, and ultimately contained, much terror that even today still frightens some younger viewers.<br />The answer came in several factors.  One was in fast paced crosscutting scenes, so that the action was not concentrated on one particular character for too long.  Another answer came with using sweet, mellow songs to help move the story along.  &quot;I'm Wishing&quot;, &quot;With A Smile In My Song&quot;, &quot;Whistle While You Work&quot;, and &quot;Heigh Ho&quot; were just some of the songs that helped carry &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;.  A third factor, and perhaps the most important of them all, came in the comedics of the dwarfs themselves.  Doc, Sleepy, Grumpy, Happy, Sneezy, Bashful, and Dopey were all meticulously created, each with their own identities; and but for them and their silliness throughout &quot;Snow White&quot;, the film may not have moved with the speed it did, and older members in the audience may have become bored, while younger ones may have become more frightened.<br />All of the elements were now in place, including a wonderful cast<BR>that starred Adriana Casoletti as Snow White, Harry Stockwell, as the prince, and Lucille Laverne as the Queen.  In its initial release, &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; pulledin over four million dollars, thereby securing both Disney's future, and the future of animated films.  Without the success of Snow White, it is easy to conclude Disney would not have attempted it again, and we never would have known of &quot;Bambi&quot; &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, or &quot;Dumbo&quot;.  Thanks to Walt Disney's heavy gamble with &quot;Snow White&quot;, his exhausting persistence in seeing it through, a flood gate of highly successful animated films have graced the silver screen, amusing and entertaining audiences for decades hence.
0060001941|5.0|I first read this book when I was 12years old. I'm now 33 and I still find myself returning to this book for its beautiful story.  I love how Betty Smith drew a picture of early 1900 Brooklyn and it's temement district. The story she reveals page by page of Francie Nolan and her family is filled with triumphs and sadness and the joy of learning and growing.
B00001QGIQ|5.0|The release of Disney's second full length animated film,<BR>&quot;Pinocchio&quot;, in 1940, catipulted both the career of Walt Disney, the man, and Walt Disney, the Corperation.  Only World War Two hampered a more world wide success of the film, which did exceeding well in America.<br />&quot;Pinocchio&quot;, which is narrated by Jiminy Cricket, making his first, but not last appearance, in a Disney film, tells the story of a lonely, old woodcarver, Geppetto, who longs for a son.<BR>After creating a wooden marionette in that of a boy, Geppetto wishes the figure could be brought to life.  <br />After Geppetto falls asleep, a blue fairy appears in the shop, and magically transforms Pinocchio the marionette, into Pinocchio the living wooden boy.  He is not a real boy at this point, but he can think and act as one, and talk like one as well.  The angel tells Pinocchio that for him to become a real little boy he must be brave, good, and to never tell a lie.<br />Geppetto is awakened.  Entering his shop he discovers Pinocchio is alive.  The very next day Pinocchio is sent off to school.  Along the way he meets a fox who persuades him to join a puppet show run by an evil man, Stromboli, much to Jiminy Cricket's disapproval.  Pinocchio is awestruck with the idea and goes on stage for this man.  He sings &quot;I've Got No Strings&quot;, while dancing around to the wild enthusiasm of the audience.<br />Stromboli, seeing how popular Pinocchio has become with the audience, becomes greedy, and kidnaps the wooden boy, locking him in a cage.  As Jiminy is trying to free him, the angel appears before Pinocchio and asks what has happened.  He invents a lie, and as he is telling it, his nose begins to grow.  The angel explains that every time Pinocchio tells a lie, this is what is going to happen.  After promising never to lie again, the angel restores his nose.<br />But it is not long before Pinocchio is led astray yet again.  This time, he joins several other boys who are making their way to Pleasure Island, a place where little boys can endulge in everything that is bad, until their hearts are content.  Such bad habits as drinking and smoking are among the &quot;pleasures&quot; these boys indulge themselves in.  It is truly an evil place, in more ways than one.  Pinocchio, and other boys are magically turning into jackasses, growing ears and tails characteristic of the beast.<br />Jiminy Cricket helps save Pinocchio from a fate worse than death, and they make it make to Geppetto's shop, only to be told by the blue angel that the man went to sea and was swallowed by a whale.  She tells Pinocchio he is still alive, and he and Jiminy go in search of him.  This bravery by Pinocchio is well acknowledged by the angel, and she decides to grant him a very special wish.<br />In many ways, &quot;Pinocchio&quot; is a warning to children that bad things can happen to little boys, and girls, who stray from the path of morality.  Indeed, bad things can happen, albeit nothing so dipicted here.  &quot;Pinochio&quot; has been considered, by critics, to be Disney's most terrifying animated film of all.  In fact, many of the scenes will frighten younger viewers.  However, for the older children, &quot;Pinocchio&quot; can be a warm and inspiring message to always do good, for the sake of good itself.
B000002BQK|5.0|Some people are afraid to purchase this album because it's different from Mariah's prior efforts. But don't, this one is a perfection!<BR>Mariah has come up with yet another best-seller (14 million copies worldwide and counting). The first single off the album, &quot;Honey&quot;, is a lyrically sexier-more RnB song than Mariah's previous ones, which debuted at #1 on Billboard. The video is also sexy :) Other hits include &quot;My All&quot; (#1) and &quot;Butterfly&quot;. &quot;Breakdown&quot; and &quot;Babydoll&quot; are heavy on Hip-Hop, and that's good, 'cause Mariah knew she had to reinvent herself. And that's exactly what she did. BTW, the album debuted #1 on Billboard (like the single) and is Mariah's personal favourite.<BR>You won't regret, buy it...

B0000027RL|5.0|Good capsule of 90s grunge music. Alive, Even Flow, Black, and Jeremy littered the radio. This was back when Pearl Jam rocked. Binaural and Yield have a some good songs, but nothing really stands out as being exceptional or sufficiently unique. Those albums you listen to simply for a change of pace.<br />I give &quot;Ten&quot; props for digging me out of listening to solely 80s (and very little 70s) rock. I was starting to broaden my musical horizons and this helped reassure that good stuff was out there.<br />Best track on this disc: Garden. Creepy and melodic with lyrics that are wonderfully ambiguous.
B00005Q45W|5.0|I am so moved.  I neglected LC for probably 25 or more years.  On a whim, I purchased this cd.  The poetry is so striking...clear yet oblique at the same time.  The voice far more soothing than in the 70's....Hard pressed to say which cut on the CD got to me the most...depends upon one's personal struggles...but In My Secret Life...oh Leonard, how did you know?   And Babylon?  Were you watching me?  Each and every poem/song has something to offer ... and what's truly great is that this soul-searching meandering is in no way depressing...it is life-affirming.  It speaks truly to the issues we encounter ... fidelity, enduring love, love found, love lost...but never with disdain, always poignant and with the quality of passion that just leaves me steaming.  Some of LC's earlier tomes just tore me up so bad I couldn't go there anymore.  This is mature, honest, confessional, and liberating.  I admit, I write poetry, so I cannot evaluate with any expertise the musical elements.  I just loved the whole cd.  Just loved it.  Buy it.  You won't be sorry.  It will grow on you in just a few hours.  It is like a drug for one's emotions.  It is awesome.
B00000JCOV|5.0|This cd was so great.  You can't do wrong in buying this cd.  A must for any metal fan.
B00005QXXO|4.0|Many remember Radiohead's career from the years 2000-2001 as a sad time.  A time in which the band refused to make the same record over and over.  A time that the band grew tired of their fame and went to less-accessable music.  A time that the band's music became acquired-taste.<br />And some remember 2000-2001 in Radiohead's existance as a happy time.  A time in which the band refused to make the same record over and over.  A time that the band grew tired of their fame and went to less-accessable music.  A time that the band's music became acquired-taste.<br />Always a firm believer in the philosophy that \\"if you don't like it, don't listen to it,\\" I was always a little troubled to read so many negative reviews about the recent Radiohead.  I thought, \\"If you don't like the band, why listen to them and then complain constantly about it?\\"  A possible conclusion may be that they are so great, that they are the band you can leave, but can't leave alone.  So there is much crying and gnashing of teeth, while those that embraced the new techno-alternative-dance-rock sound eat it all up.  <br />\\"I Might Be Wrong\\" may be the same songs from the Kid A/Amnesiac sessions, and may run along the same vein, but they are different.  They are faster, more guitar driven, but still beautiful.  Art-freaks from around the globe already have a creativity overload half way through \\"National Anthem.\\"  What draws so much attention to the Oxford five-some?  Maybe it has something to do with the slow, minor-lead acoustic keys of \\"Like Spinning Plates.\\"  Maybe it's Yorke's hypnotic droning and chant-like \\"women and children first\\" of this album's amazing version of \\"Idiotech.\\"  Maybe it's the synchopated \\"Morning Bell,\\" with Yorke's chiorboy vocals lacing the track.  Who Knows?  But more importantly, who cares?  The point is, no one really \\"gets\\" the band....  It's just fantastic music; the best, in fact, of the last twenty years.  And \\"Live Recordings\\" catches them in concert, at the artistic peak of their career.  Now that's (money) I'm willing to shell out, even if it's only eight songs.  Enjoy...
B00005QK3W|5.0|From the beautiful ballad such as \\"I Do\\" to the scalding rocker \\"Rinse the Raindrops\\" and everything in between. From the heart-wrenching \\"From a Lover to A Friend\\" to the cry for \\"Freedom\\", McCartney has placed his rawest emotions into this CD from his own tragic loss Linda, then the obviously exhilarating experience of winning Heather.<br />These is no need to say anything more about McCartney's talent in creating melodies, but the question about who is rock's best bass player has been answered once and for all as the bass line in each song hold it's own and serves as the backbone to the whole CD.<br />Buy the CD...and tell everyone you know about it!
B00004X0Q0|1.0|I believe that I've written about this cd before but I can't remember so I'm gonna write again.  THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST CDS I'VE EVER HEARD!! How could anyone call this music?! What really brings them down is there pointless, too-big-for-their-own-good words, where sometimes don't even fit the context of what they are trying to say.  And don't give me any \\"you don't understand big words BS.\\"  I am a very intellectual person and this is just stupid.  The music itself is just average mid-line punk rock. So what do you get? A extremely mediocore band with no singing/lyrical talent whatsoever.  Even his voice (...) Wow I can't go on, I'm getting sick just thinking about it.
B00005QDW5|1.0|You can't just go around shortening echoes just because its twenty minutes long.  Its complete and utter nonsense.  Now, lets assume for one brief second that the addition of When the Tigers Broke Free makes up for this unfortunate error in judgement.  You can now go on and see that Obscured, Ummagumma, Atom Heart, and More are all left off the album presumably so they would have room to put on....KEEP TALKIN?!?!?!?!? I just don't think that Pink Floyd is a band that can be adequetly represented with a greatest hits album. You really need to have the individual albums and listen to them in their entirety.  Highest Possible Recommendation to Avoid!
B000002GF8|5.0|Of their five albums, this one sold more copies than any other and was their most commercially successful. At the same time critics and fans alike raved. Those of us who were big fans back then are still listening to this one and loving every minute of it (almost). &quot;Synchronicity I&quot; gets the blood flowing and immediately goes into the prehistoric sounding &quot;Walking in Your Footsteps&quot; which is fitting since the topic is dinosaurs. &quot;Mother&quot; is really the only throw-away song from the album (that's why I said &quot;almost&quot; earlier) and it's hard not to draw parallels between it and Anthony Perkins's character in Psycho. One of my favorite songs, &quot;Synchronicity II&quot; is a dark song (with an equally dark video) and seems to have Sting characterizing a dreary existence. Side 2, as it were, has a string of singles in &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot; (not a love song, more of a stalker's anthem), &quot;King of Pain&quot; (another everything is bad song, but a great one nonetheless), and &quot;Wrapped Around Your Finger&quot;. The rest of the songs are good as well. The Police always excelled at making timeless music.  Here, they went just a little bit further pulling out all the stops. How fitting since this was their last album before splitting up.
B00005R2M3|4.0|This is my first Shakira album, but when I heard &quot;Suerte&quot; on Galavision, I wanted her new album so finally I bought it last night and I have listened to it at least 10 times already. Shakira is definitely unique. Her style is a cross between Alanis Morisette, some latino, and country and occasional dance. Tracks like &quot;Underneath Your Clothes&quot;, &quot;Wherever, Whenever&quot;, &quot;The One&quot;, and &quot;Eyes Like Yours (Ojos Asi)&quot; are the highlights of her album. Some of the others are a little repetitive but these are the hits of the album. I am disappointed that I don't hear her on the radio much because I know a lot more people would like her if they got the chance to hear her. So I recommend this to anyone who qualifies for the Shakira style.
B000003BF1|5.0|A top notch album no doubt, but I have to deduct a half a star and I'll explain shortly. In this album we have slower tempo country/blues type songs in &quot;Love in Vain&quot;, &quot;Country Honk&quot; (seems like we've heard this before), and the title song. The album is at its best, however, when the Stones are being their typically dark, raunchy, rockin' selves. This is best displayed on classics like &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot; (&quot;just a shot away&quot;), &quot;Live with Me&quot; (love that opening bass!), &quot;Midnight Rambler&quot; (&quot;put a fist&quot;, put a fist&quot;), and &quot;Monkey Man&quot;. <br />The half a star deduction is for &quot;You Can't Always Get What You Want&quot;. I've just never been big fan of the song and I think it's overrated. It isn't *bad* but I don't think it belongs with all of the other great songs on this album. Oh well, enjoy.
B00003CY0V|1.0|...bad. What a waste of time, talent and money. It throws in everything but the kitchen sink: machine guns, rocket launchers, car crashes, big explosions, stylish clothes, computer hacking, Travolta's recycled &quot;Broken Arrow&quot; villian schtick, hackneyed dialogue/situations, nudity, etc. But where's the feeling behind it, I ask? You couldn't care a lick about any of the characters or their motives. No more can be said. Avoid like the plague.
B000000W5L|5.0|A great album? You better believe it! Had I been older than two years old when this album came out in 1972, I would have wondered how the band could match the previous great, Sticky Fingers. With this album that's exactly what they did. This is 18 songs of pure early 70's rock and roll (one of the best kinds)! Sometimes, when I need an adrenalin rush I pop in the CD and listen to the first five songs with the volume turned up to 11. &quot;Rocks Off&quot;, the short, but blistering &quot;Rip This Joint&quot;, the bluesy &quot;Shake Your Hips&quot;, slow, steady groovin' &quot;Casino Boogie&quot; and the classic &quot;Tumbling Dice&quot; are worth the album price alone.<br />But it doesn't stop there. There are songs with country roots such as &quot;Sweet Virginia&quot;, &quot;Torn and Frayed&quot; (a personal favorite of mine), and &quot;Sweet Black Angel&quot;. Others are Stones type rock and roll including &quot;Ventilator Blues&quot;, &quot;All Down the Line&quot;, and &quot;Stop Breaking Down&quot;. The album's farewell song, and it seems designed as such, is &quot;Soul Survivor&quot; (another personal favorite). <br />One thing about EOMS needs to be noted. This is not like any other Stones album or any other album, period, for that matter. There is not really a clean, crisp sound here and the vocals are oftentimes low key and in the background, just like another instrument (&quot;I Just Want to See His Face&quot; and &quot;Sweet Black Angel&quot; are two god examples of that). I guess that's one of things that makes it unique. You can't go wrong here and I think you'll be playing it over and over again.<br />This was #3 on Rolling Stone magazine's top 100 albums of all time in 1987, behind Sgt. Pepper and The Sex Pistols. I can't see it losing ground to anything anytime soon.
B00004Z459|5.0|kept it!<br />It's fabulous! This guy's voice is from heaven. The music makes sense for every mood. Get it!
B000000W5N|5.0|I've always referred to all of the albums by The Rolling Stones between Beggar's Banquet and Exile on Main Street as &quot;mid-period Stones&quot;. That is to say that most of everything before 1968 was a different sounding band, more geared to radio staples such as &quot;Get Off My Cloud&quot;, &quot;Satisfaction&quot;, and &quot;Under My Thumb&quot;. Also, most of what they produced after 1973 (with a couple of exceptions) was also geared to radio but in an even more popish way. On this album they were at the height of creativity and they went all out to make pure rock and roll. <br />&quot;Brown Sugar&quot; really gets the blood flowing and then launches into the rough-edged &quot;Sway&quot;. Two of the gretest songs by the Stones ever are here in &quot;Can't You Hear Me Knocking&quot; and &quot;Bitch&quot;. Also not to be overlooked are &quot;Sister Morphine&quot; and &quot;Moonlight Mile&quot;.  Two reasons for the success of this album: This was the first album for lead guitarist Mick Taylor, who was also the band's best guitarist easily beating out the other two, Brian Jones and Ron Wood. Taylor really gets into the solos. Just check out the solo at the end of &quot;Sway&quot; and the musical interlude that begins halfway through &quot;Can't You Hear Me Knocking&quot;. Another reason is the magnificent addition of horns that complement many of the songs including &quot;Brown Sugar&quot;, &quot;Can't You Hear Me Knocking&quot;, and &quot;Bitch&quot;. <br />This made Rolling Stone magazine's top 100 albums when the issue came out in 1987. It'll be there in 2087 as well as many of of will be rockin' to this one for decades to come.
B00000F169|5.0|I've noticed many of the reviews for this little gem have been positive.  However, to the folks who bagged on it, perhaps they should do a little reading about the history of the film and then look at it from that perspective. <br />The movie was the final USC film project of John Carpenter and Dan O'Bannon and has excellent production design by Ron Cobb (who went on to other classics like Blade Runner).  It was originally about 45 minutes long, but Jack Harris provided funds to add footage so that it could make the rounds at drive-ins.  So, yes the film is low budget.  But, the work and effort that went into shows through every frame.<br />Yes, it was a beach ball.  Its a joke.  Get it.
B00005QG9J|4.0|With &quot;nu-metal&quot; being so formulic,it's nice to see a true<BR>band like Incubus come along.Instead of following the same<BR>formula that other rap-rock bands use(1st single:hard-charged<BR>&quot;we rock&quot; anthem;2nd single:self-pitying power ballad-sort of a<BR>new milliuniem update of hair bands),Incubus use their diverse<BR>influnces(hip-hop,Lennon,rock) and make wonderful music.<BR> &quot;Morning View&quot;,Incubus' followup to their double platinum debut,&quot;Make Yourself&quot;,eximlifies their winning sound even more.<BR>Fans of Incubus' fine Top Ten smash ballad &quot;Drive&quot; will <BR>certainly dig &quot;Morning View&quot;'s first single,&quot;I Wish You Were<BR>Here&quot;(no relation to the Pink Floyd classic).The etheral<BR>&quot;Mexico&quot; and &quot;Nice To Know You&quot;-two of &quot;Morning&quot;'s strongest cuts<BR>are both senstive but not wimpy or sappy.<BR> Incubus is not just another nu-metal band.&quot;Morning View&quot;<BR>shows you that in the fullest.This album is not for bone head<BR>fans of say,Slipknot or Limp Bizkit but for smart,expressive<BR>folks who want something with both some rock and some HONESTY.
B000021YQV|5.0|This, Mudvayne's LD 50, and Nirvana's In Utero are my top fave albums. <BR>Before I start reviewing, I have something I need to get off my chest. I'm sick of people bashing on Numetal. I mean, sure bands like Limp Bizkit and Drowning Pool bite, but most people who hate great bands like Deftones and Mudvayne and System of a Down are pretty close minded. They can't accept that these guys are getting more airplay than their death metal bands (Not to say that I hate Death and Black metal. In fact, I'm a big fan of Dimmu Borgir and Cannibal Corpse). <BR>Grudges aside, this album is superb. All the songs are great. Highlights are &quot;Aerials&quot; (My favorite track), &quot;Forest&quot;, &quot;Chop Suey!&quot;, &quot;Atwa&quot;, and &quot;Prison Song&quot;. All the songs are excellent though. Pick up a copy of this. You won't be dissapointed.
B00005R2M3|4.0|Shakira, the name may seem new to many of you. Or maybe it hasn't. Maybe you've been a fan of her music for years, or you've been paying attention to the media and have seen that this artist cross-over has been long await and hyped for years now, ever since she decided to make this huge step. Well,her album &quot;Laundry Service&quot; has finally arrived, the moment of truth, her cross-over dreams have finally become a reality? But is it too good to be true? Will she hit mainstream stardom? or wil her dreams implode and spit back in her face, with an unsuccesful run on the billboards. I don't believe that will particularly happen, the hype was worth it, cause the final cut of the album is more than a Satisfactory effort. Her lyrics again stay true to herself and is not lost in a new languge, she definitley has not been affected to alter words for the US market. The fact that she almost did everything on the album is impressive not only to the recieveing audience but to everyone in the music business, it has been a long time since an artist put together an entire album, especially the type of artist that Shakira is (Pop). Not only are the lyrics impressive, but the music amazing,her pop beats and latin influences becomes even more enhanced when she brings rock and roll into the mix. I defninitly recomend this album to all of those who have either just recently fallen in love with shakira' unique sound or have been in love with them for years. &quot;Laundry Service&quot; will enthrall you with its new age meets old world influences.
B00005N9CV|5.0|I can't believe all the negative reviews this CD has been getting from the public! I have all of Diana Krall's CDs, &amp; they're all classics. However, this album stands out for me simply because of Claus Ogerman's string arrangments. For many years, jazz artists have been critized for using strings; people claiming that it's not &quot;pure jazz&quot;. Charlie Parker, Clifford Brown, Wynton Marsalis, just to name a few, have used strings, &amp; it hasn't taken away their status as legendary jazz artists. Diana Krall IS a true jazz artist. The strings are perfect for the songs that she selected for this session. If you took away the strings, you would have the same Diana Krall, playing &amp; singing just like she did on &quot;Love Scenes&quot;, &quot;All For You&quot;, etc. I'm not going to comment on any particular track. However, I say to all Diana Krall fans, you need to give this CD a 2nd chance. Once you do, I hope you will discover the beauty of the music that she has to offer on this album.
B00005QK3W|5.0|This CD is not as easily accessible as the 1997 McCartney classic<BR>&quot;Flaming Pie.&quot; Its melodies are somewhat more complex and it takes some time for McCartney's melodies to become ingrained in your subconscious. In Driving Rain, McCartney explores the loss of Linda and the finding of a new love. It is a CD full of hope and tinged with sadness and sometimes despair. The CD's lineup is interesting in that each part of the CD represents different styles. The CD starts off surprisingly with Paul's bass leading into the gutsy &quot;Lonely Road,&quot; followed by the piano led &quot;From a Lover to a Friend,&quot; and the dark and wonderful &quot;She's Given up Talking.&quot; These three songs are sad. The middle of the CD from &quot;Driving Rain&quot; to &quot;Your Way&quot; are fun Macca silly love songs with &quot;Magic&quot; being particularly poignant given that it is about Linda.<BR>Silly love songs are no longer silly when they are sung by a 58 year old man who has lost the love of his life ---the lyrics are more meaningful now then they were in the 1970s. The end of the CD from &quot;Spinning on an Axis&quot; to &quot;Rinse the Raindrops&quot; represent some of Paul's best and most experimental work. I see influences of his work on Rushes and his classical work. &quot;Your Loving Flame&quot; is a classic Macca ballad and &quot;Rinse the Raindrops&quot; is the song that I play over and over. It is very good. The CD closes with &quot;Freedom&quot; and I am not sure what to say about it --it is catchy but maybe strays from Paul's philosophy ---remember in 1997's &quot;Calico Skies&quot; he writes, &quot;Long live all us crazy solidiers who were born under calico skies, may we never be asked to handle all the weapon of war that we despise.&quot; Still, Sept. 11 affected all of us including Macca --- and as such the song represents a place and time in history. All in all, Paul is on a hot streak. I rank this with Pie, Band on the Run, Tug or War, Ram, and Flowers in the Dirt as essential McCartney.
B00005O5CM|5.0|For a movie that is in no way shocking, and that has no suprise twists it is the brilliance of the writing that truly makes this movie.
B000053SPI|5.0|there is definitely a journey without steve perry, augeri is better than perry in my book,this album is like &quot;depature&quot;meets &quot;frontiers&quot; the songs are excellent and they did'nt overdue it with power ballads . on behind the music<BR>perry made a crock statement that he felt he was never part of the band. with arrival , now he has a legit reason. may augeri<BR>last with the band for infinity.
B00005QK3W|5.0|after reading some silly reviews of this CD i decided to post my own. my favorite mccartney cd is 'Wild Life' followed by &quot;Unplugged'. why? because theyre fresh. experimental and modern sounding. Beatles fan arent going to like this if they settle for the dismal 'SGT pepper Era' of the band. this might be way over their heads...  'Driving Rain' is what the beatles wouldve sounded like had Stuart learned the bass, Pete was in the band and John had never died. <br />Instead we got Ringo...eeck..and sadly Stuart died at age 21. Anyone questioining this review can check out the double CD set...'Wildcat!' featuring stuart, paul john and george...thats the closest thing to 'Driving Rain.' <br />Paul Mccartney is 58 years old. and for someone of that age to come out with an artsy, well through out..non commercial..alternative rock record is not only unheard of, but also would make anything Ringo or George or even john released look like 2nd rate tripe.   <br />George had a couple of great records with &quot;Wonderwall music and Electronic Sound&quot; and john had the 'wedding album and a couple with yoko..&quot; but for the most part nothing can hold a candle next to 'Driving Rain.' <br />And please No More Jeff Lynne!
B00003CY0V|1.0|This is a film created by committee. It's a film that tries to be everything all at the same time, doing nothing well, and creating a storyline that is unbelievable, stupid and frankly boring.<br />There are far too many, so called, &quot;exciting&quot; action scenes that lead nowhere except to try and break up the monotony of the laughable storyline.<br />See Sneakers instead.
B00005QG9J|4.0|I'm sorry if Incubus isn't funky enough, or isn't hard enough.  I'm sorry if they've changed.  But isn't change good?  It all depends on what direction you change into, and this is the way Incubus is going.  Make Yourself was a fun album that threw together just about everything Incubus had been doing up till that point.  They threw in &quot;Drive&quot; and &quot;Stellar&quot; for the faint of heart.<br />On Morning View, things have changed.<br />It's back to the loud, and more of the soft.  I must say that some of the soft tunes on here don't float my boat.  (I always skip over &quot;Echo&quot; and &quot;Are You In?&quot; because they are a disgrace to an otherwise seamless album.)<br />There's the loud.<BR>Just like with &quot;Privelege&quot; on Make Yourself, &quot;Nice To Know You&quot; lets Morning View listeners know that Incubus have a message, and they're gonna tell you, and there's not much you can do about it.  The opening track is one of the roughest and yet most melodic songs on the album, along with &quot;Blood on the Ground&quot; and &quot;Under My Umbrella&quot; (a true rock gem).  Incubus certainly can still pound it out.<br />There's the soft.<BR>Like &quot;Drive&quot; and &quot;I Miss You,&quot; there are some songs on here that can either make you swoon or make you vomit.  &quot;Warning&quot; teeters on that fine line, sounding a lot more like &quot;Drive&quot; than &quot;Echo&quot; does- &quot;Warning&quot; has the great lyrical message and the catchy chorus &quot;Drive&quot; had.  &quot;Are You In?&quot; and &quot;Echo&quot; take the soft too far.  There is such thing as moderation, and on these tunes, they went overboard.<br />But that is easily forgiven, for they close out this stunning work of music with &quot;Under My Umbrella&quot; and the GREAT song, no matter what type of music, &quot;Aqueous Transmission.&quot;  This song represents the type of creativity and artistic wonder that much of music lacks today (hell, even &quot;Are you in&quot; and &quot;echo&quot; lack it) and is so refreshing to hear.  I commend Incubus for this great closer.  OK, so it's sorta repetitive.  OK, it kinda drags on for awhile.  Is that a problem?  It's still a great melody, simple yet soothing lyrics... Incubus has the formula and they passed the test.<br />Incubus as a band is definitely at a crossroad here.  They can either maintain this limbo of old and new, go head first into an alt-pop disaster, or go back to the golden oldies of their career.  Personally, I'm liking this little pergutory of musical bliss.
0345345061|5.0|This is the book one should read after they have finished &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; and just before they are about start &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; or &quot;Unfinished Tales&quot;.  With the film of &quot;Fellowship...&quot; to come out in December 2001, it is clear that there will be an increased interest in the canon of Tolkien's works.<br />Peter S. Beagle introduces the book with an essay in which he gives a good analysis of Gollum's character; notice how the creature always spoke in first-person plural.  &quot;The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth Beorhthelm's Son&quot; is so far Tolkien's only attempt at a play (brief though it is) and at writing something of his own that has the feeling of Beowulf.  It is an addendum to what happened after the historical Battle of Maldon when the Danes invaded England.  Tolkien was the type who would have felt at home in medieval northern Europe, and probably would have been a scribe like Snorri Sturluson.<br />The collection called &quot;Tree and Leaf&quot; is another side of Tolkien.  &quot;Farmer Giles...&quot; is a non-Middle-earth tale about a medieval knight off to fight a dragon, and &quot;Leaf By Niggle&quot; is a Borges-type of magical realism about a painter trying to create reality out of his art.  It is the closest piece, I believe, that Tolkien came to writing what snobs consider &quot;literary&quot;.<br />It stands on its own, as does the classic essay &quot;On Fairy Stories&quot;, in which he shows that fairy and/or faery tales are worth the attention of adults.  To quote, he believes that fantasy is a higher form of Art, the most pure form and the most potent.  He shows that fantasy works very well when it presents themes on recovery, escape, and consolation.<br />Now for the poetry.  Ever wonder who Tom Bombadil really was?  He's a bit Falstaffian for a Maia, and I doubt he will be in the film, but somehow Tolkien believed it necessary to include him as part of Frodo's journey to Rivendell.  &quot;The Adventures of TB&quot; include Goldberry and Old Man Willow and quite a helping of Hey Come derry-do, merry-dol my darling!  These poems begin what is known as The Red Book of Westmarch, originally written by Bilbo Baggins and Sam Gamgee (Tolkien only compiled them).  Most of the songs which are about animals, trolls, and the Man-in-the-Moon, seem suited to the ears of children.  The poems which stand out, however, are the narratives like &quot;Errantry&quot;, &quot;The Hoard&quot;, and &quot;The Sea-Bell&quot;.  Tolkien's poetry is in the classic traditional style of rhyme and meter.  There's is nothing &quot;modern&quot; about it, and that is its quality.  One who is inclined to reading T.S. Eliot or Wallace Stevens may not enjoy<br />Tolkien's old-fashioned style.  But to readers of Kipling, Masefield, Graves, Sassoon, and Houseman, Tolkien's poetry is a delight, refreshing, and a fine conclusion to a collection of works by one of the best writers of the 20th century.f TB&quot; include Goldberry and Old Man Willow and quite a helping of Hey Come derry-do, merry-dol my darling!

B00000BKDW|5.0|I wrote a review earlier praising &quot; The Number Of The Beast &quot; as Maiden's finest moment. That however was when I first started listening to them. It's still a good album, but they have better ones. This album finalizes a progression that started with &quot; Piece Of Mind &quot; they started writing songs with smarter topics and they stopped doing cheesy songs like &quot; Invaders &quot; or &quot; Quest For Fire &quot; This was released in a great year for metal. Both Maiden and Metallica released their best albums.  This is when it all came together. It doesn't have a total outright song deserving of and A+ like  &quot; Revelations &quot; or &quot;Hallowed Be Thy Name &quot; but all of its songs are good, 3 or 4 of them even classic that it stands the test of time. Brave New World does come pretty damn close though. Anyways, heres my individual grades for the songs.<br />                                        Song Grades<br />1. Aces High-this is a good combat song, but tends to get overated by people. I don't understand why people praise this song and dis &quot; Tailgunner &quot; off  &quot; No Prayer For The Dying &quot;, that's a better song with a darker feel and it doesn't have the opera vocals this song has, if that song would have been on this album people would be praising it,  for a war-song &quot; Aces High &quot; sounds too &quot; upbeat &quot;, kind of like Motley Crue doing a war-song<BR>    Final Grade-B<BR>2. 2 Minutes To Midnight-this is a well-done song with a catchy chorus and great lyrics, this song is dealing with the threat of nuclear-war, possibly Maiden's greatest &quot;radio song &quot;<BR>    Final Grade-A-<BR>3. Flash Of The Blade-the first of the two sword-fighting songs on here, it's a good song, but not great, has a catchy chorus, but this song ultimately serves as a bridge to the next song<BR>    Final Grade-B<BR>4. The Duellists-a guitar classic like Megadeth's &quot; Hangar 18 &quot; this song has the same format as the classic &quot; Where Eagles Dare &quot; off  &quot; Piece Of Mind &quot; intro-vocals-long instrumental-bridge-ending vocals, this song takes a fencing duel and makes it into an epic song, the instrumental part feels like an epic duel. This instrumental part has the 3rd greatest guitar solo of all time behind &quot; Hangar 18 &quot; and Metallica's &quot; Fade To Black &quot; The vocals are awesome too and the chorus is emotional. Sure the long instrumental is a little bit pretentious, but who cares?<BR>    Final Grade-A<BR>5. Back In The Village-I don't know why people put this song in the same category as atrocities like &quot; Quest For Fire &quot; or &quot; Invaders &quot; It doesn't have cheesy vocals or cheesy lyrics like the laughable &quot; Quest For Fire &quot; I don't see what's wrong with this song. The intro is pretty good and the lyrics aren't that bad. His voice sounds pretty good on this song. I like this song better than &quot; Aces High &quot; I like the part where they say &quot; shellshock in the kitchen, tables overturned &quot;<BR>    Final Grade-B+<BR>6. Powerslave-this song is the sequel to &quot; Revelations &quot; off &quot; Piece Of Mind &quot; and is their greatest title track. While &quot; Revelations &quot; described the birth, &quot; Powerslave &quot; describes the death. This song has very memorable guitar.  This is the 3rd best song dealing with Ancient Egypt I have ever heard, Second would have to be &quot; Revelations &quot; and the best song without a doubt is Metallicas &quot; Creeping Death &quot; and all these songs came within a year of each other.<BR>    Final Grade-A<BR>7. Rime Of The Ancient Mariner-you could view this song two ways. You could view it as overlong and pretentious or you could sit down and listen to a well-put-together song that  contains excellent guitar, great tempo changes and great lyrics. I find myself singing this song-a-lot. The second half of the song after the quiet midsection with spoken poetry makes itall worth it. <BR>    Final Grade-A<br />This is quite simply one of the best albums ever and Maiden's peak. Definitely worth the money.
B00005OM4N|3.0|I loved so much the first CDs of Britney, but this one was mediocre. She should have stuck to her regular bubble gum pop routine instead of this &quot;adult/edgy pop&quot; she now making. There are three good songs on here. Number One &quot;Slave 4U&quot; Number Two &quot;Overprotected&quot; and Number 7 &quot;I Love Rock 'n' Roll.&quot; These are the 'real' bubblegum Britney, not this 'new' Britney.
0792839730|2.0|Without commenting on the content of the film itself, I'd only like to say that in my opinion the video quality was about the worst I've seen on DVD. As I watched white flecks popping like VHS dropouts, I was totally distracted from enjoying a film I've watched numerous times. I guess I've have been spoiled from viewing so many pristine images on most DVD releases.
0060916540|2.0|This is an incredible story of one man's determination to survive after a terrifying climbing accident in the Andes. However,I find the recap of his experiences rather empty. I cannot imagine being this desperate for survival without some kind of spiritual awaking. Instead, Simpson continually unleashes a string of curses for his bad luck. Additionally, after surviving, there is no mention of his recovery, his thankfulness for making it through, nor any plans for future climbing. It was a disappointing book that leaves the reader hanging.
6305622930|5.0|Patton!<BR>The name inspires respect, awe, reverence, and for some, FEAR.  The liberals of this world fear men like Patton because he was the epitome of masculinity, the apotheosis of brutality, the apostle of death, and the prophet of American victory in World War II. Liberals, as any one with common sense understands, are opposed to war, guns, death, no matter the circumstances. These pacificial neo-Chamberlain (...) lunatics would have us turn the other cheek at Bin-Laden's parade or horrors that were visited upon the good people of New York on Sept. 11.  Under their delusional reasoning that all war is quintessentially evil, it follows that our response to Japan's sneak attack on Pearl Harbor would have provoked similar outrage in these picket-carrying, flag-burning, country hating, bed-wetting, effiminate liberals.<br /> These zealots should watch Patton so that for once in their miserable lives they will encounter an authority figure who is the antethesis to the bedwetting liberal professors they are exposed to in the surrealistic world of academia. Not to say that liberal professors are all bad, its just that one can imagine the outcome of the Battle of the Bulge had it been fought by men who think like they do, that flag-burning, and singing 'koom ba ya' are appropriate alternatives to defending Nazi advances into Western Europe. Hmmm, a nation full of Pattons during a time of war, or a nation full of effiminate liberal professors? In which nation would you prefer to live?  You do the math!
B000002X2B|5.0|I heard this album the week it came out.  Saw the later-day Jefferson Starship (before Marty rejoined them), but with Pappa John Creach, and the last 40 or so minutes of the show was this album.  As Gracie said, while the band was tuning up, &quot;Ok, here we go with a 7-hour song&quot;.<br />I haven't seen anyone mention that this is a direct and profound (and romantic...&quot;...would you like to go up on A-Deck and look at them with me&quot;) musical interpertation of Robert A. Heinlein's &quot;Orphan's of the Sky&quot; (which of course introduced Lazarus Long (aka, Woodrow Wilson Smith, about 245 years old at the time).  <br />There were stories that this Paul Kantner opus was awarded a special Hugo Award, and would love if anyone could verify that.<br />The interplay, the strengths, the courage of everyone's putting their musicality out in this VERY experimental album, is true to real musicianship and artistry.  <br />One thing I hate never hearing is John Cipollini, of Quicksilver, playing with Jerry Garcia and the Jefferson entourage.  I saw all three of their groups on the same bill a time or two, but lawdy......<br />&quot;Have you seen the stars tonight...&quot;
0679731725|5.0|The more I read this novel, the more impressive it becomes. The sheer control that Ishiguro has over his prose is a lesson to writers everywhere - truly remarkable. And one of the very few great novels that has a film adaptation which almost does it justice. Will this novel overshadow the rest of Ishiguro's career? It might, but I truly hope it doesn't. I recently read Adam Parkes's book about this novel, and I can recommend it highly. He's particularly good on Ishiguro's influences.
B00005QW5X|5.0|i was with this girl and we wondered into this movie, i knew absolutely nothing about it, and let me tell ya; wow! talk about great escapism.  i can honestly say i didn't think about anything else the whole duration of the film.  (...)Plus, the music is extremely infectuous.
B00003CXXI|5.0|I bought this video the day after it was released in stores, and since that day have seen it 17 times.  My 2-year old son loves it, specifically Donkey, and makes me &quot;play the tape&quot; at least once a day.<br />This movie is hysterical, beautifully done, and touching, in it's own way.  The message of &quot;don't judge a book by it's cover&quot; is there, and it can be understood by even the youngest viewer.  Besides, all the flatulant humor is a riot!
B00005OWIU|3.0|It's a slick production, and Williams and his team have done a decent job. The Main Theme (Hedwig's theme) is mysterious and magical, and provides a childlike wonderment to the opening of the disc.<br />Shame then that Jurassic Park motifs should pop up here and there, and the Gringotts goblins have similar cues to JarJar Binks and the Ewoks.<br />Works well as CD, if a little loud on occasion - turn up the volume to hear the fantastic celeste solos, and then a 90 piece orchestra boots you in the face with asteroid and pod race music. You may need new batteries for your remote...<br />Still, it's a good CD, although not his best, and it's not the LSO (not that it matters).<BR>So buy it, enjoy it for a week or two and then shelve it with the rest of your Williams collection.
6305313687|4.0|If you've seen this flick before, you know that is' hard to trivialize the very REAL an' STRONG message it's tryin' to convey. The way this movie uses the language of racism, whether gutter or sophisticated, as well as the rabble-rousing rhetoric an' intelligence of Edward Norton's character Derek, makes for a damn compelling watch.    This probably is one'a the best an' more important films of its year. It's beautifully shot, intriguing an' definitely thought-provoking. But whenever discussions are brought up about this film, whether someone felt it was good or not, it seems that the one unanimous praise is Norton's performance. He was one'a my favorite actors before this based on his should'a-won-the-Oscar performance in 'Primal Fear', but he friggin' ASTOUNDED me in his ability to be completely immersed in two so different roles here; one as a neo-Nazi skinhead, with bulging muscles, a shaved head, and a swastika tattoed over his heart, an' one as a lonely, disillusioned young man who must struggle to redeem himself. He personified the concept of a bright kid with bad ideas; he's burning with hatred from what has been learned through his father's death and the struggle to find an ideology and a purpose in life.    Grief-stricken and lonely, Derek has become the man of a dysfunctional household. His father's death while tryin' to preserve a burnin' crackhouse has motivated Derek toward the Nazi cause an' it's here that we see Venice Beach as a breeding ground for hate crimes an' white supremacist rallies with Derek as the mos' charismatic orater.      The boiling point comes when two black guys attempt to steal Derek's car one night, after bein' provoked by gettin' slammed on the basketball court. He marches out in his undies with a gun clutched in his hand.  He murders them in cold blood right there on the street outside his house; torturing an' brutalizing both of them. Is' a disturbing scene but nothing is more striking and horrifying than the sequence when thepolice arrive; there's a glimmer in his eye an' a proud smile on his face, as the haunting score rises over the soundtrack.  He's staring at his little brother who witnessed the whole incident.  And he's staring with the shameless pride an' honor of a man who had just doled out a taste of \\"justice\\". These early scenes as well as the ending, are some'a the most compelling pieces of filmmaking I've seen in a long time.  So much so, that it almost completely overshadows some of the sloppy and rushed quality of the rest of it, like the fact that Derek's prison experience isn't really touched upon quite enough, an' the way the film seems to want to cover too much ground in too little time.      Using black and white to show the recent past, and color to show the 24-hour period after Derek is released from prison, Tony Kaye gives meaning an' relevance to the simplest thing, like the newly-reformed Derek staring at himself in the mirror after a shower the first night back home, looking at the swastika on his heart.  The newfound sense of humanity and compassion for human life has finally brought out the shame in him.  As he stares, he places his right hand over his heart, covering up the swastika.  Filled with depression, guilt, an' regret over his life, he can only dream of what he could have been and look forward.  In spite of its shortcomings, this is a good and powerful film that MUST be seen and understood.
0446677450|5.0|This book is a great first step to anyone wanting to start their own business.  It introduces a new way of thinking that is contrary to many of the things that are taught in the public school system. Mr. Kiyosakis' ideas are very simple and basic but, very true.  This book introduces a profound change in perception of money and working.  This is a great book.
B00000DCHI|5.0|The divide between Volume 1 and 2 is not simply chronological one.<br />First track of Volume 2, My Life, has more solid edge than<br />Vol.1 tracks. Solid tracks like Big Shots, You May Be Right,Pressure show that Billy lived with the turning point of music trend in late 70s and early 80s. It was a time when melodic rockers featuring high tone voice(as Steve Perry)such as Journey, Boston, Styx, and Survivor thumped like dinosours. Billy under pressure from this trend, however, secured his footing. His 1983 album Innocent Man where big hits like Uptown Girl, Tell Her About It, and The Longest Time are from highlights almost every aspect of Billy Joel's appeal as finest male voice on earth. You're Only Human and The Night Is Still Young are nice tracks as extension of Innocent Man.<br />It is a nice compilation showing us what good music is all about.
B00005M4JS|5.0|For me, much of the pleasure in this film lies in the way in which it taps into so many of the classic stories with which many of us have grown up. There is so much here that comes from other tales, myths, movies, etc. There is the &quot;clever North Wind&quot; bringing Vianne and Anouk to the village (not unlike the wind upon which Mary Poppins flew in and out via her umbrella). There is also the &quot;suspicious&quot; influences of Vianne and Anouk in the village which are akin not only to those of Mary Poppins in the Banks' household, but also of Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon when they entered Pleasantville.<br />Of course, and as other reviewers have pointed out, another wonderful feature of this film is its amazing sensory appeal. The appeal is not, however, limited to taste, as one might expect of a film entitled *Chocolat*. It's rich in visual appeal--sunlight, firelight, candlelight, clouds, shadows; tactile appeal--snow, water, fire; and auditory appeal--with a beautifully haunting soundtrack and some very fun songs played by Johnny Depp as Roux and his fellow river rats.<br />The only real problem I had with the movie really concerned the Comte de Reynaud. He seemed, unlike the other characters who managed to combine comedy with deeper thoughts and emotions, to be an entirely comic character. I personally believe that this is due to shallow character development. I wanted to know more about his personal life--what, in more detail, he was hiding from the townspeople that made him so pompous; what he thought about that made him so adamant about resisting temtation. He just didn't seem. . . tortured enough. Although he had certain traits that were familiar, his was a character that I have not encountered before and therefore needed more information in order to relate to him better.<br />Despite my problem with the Comte de Reynaud, I think this is a wonderful film--perhaps even one of my all-time favorites--and therefore deserving of no fewer stars thanfive. The time of the film's setting--during Lent--is perfect for that which the film accentuates. Comedy, drama, mysticism, magic--it depicts so much in life which is there for us to enjoy. Watch it, and perhaps it will change yours.
630416923X|5.0|I would like to purchase this set but cannot figure out how to buy it!  Are there any available or not?!
B000002R6A|4.0|(Please note: Same review as below, with minor changes, but I wanted to get it under my name)<BR>This double LP set (originally, that is, &quot;back in the day&quot;--it is a single CD) was the last album by an Animals configuration until the original band did the obligatory reunion album some years later. An album filled with excess, bombast and extended tunes, and I love every second of it. A great example of how the British invasion morphed into psychedelia and ultimately self-destructed. Highlights include their version of River Deep, Mountain High, which is a great companion to Tina Turner's, and their loving Bee Gees tribute, To Love Somebody. I just read a book named Animal Tracks which gives a great straightforward history of the Animals and useful background on this and all of their albums, and I recommend it for true fans of the group.
B000000WA4|5.0|This album is indeed a masterpeice. &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon&quot; of the 90's.  The Smashing Pumpkins did reach the apogee with Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness. Billy's intricate use of feedback in 'An Ode To No One', 'Where Boys Fear To Tread' and the Doom FX in 'x.y.u.' and 'Where Boys Fear To Tread'. The gentle 'Mellon Collie and the Infinte Sadness' flows in to 'Tonight Tonight' and then 'Jellybelly' rips you into peices. Only the Smashing Pumpkins can have a song like 'Cupid De Locke' and 'Jellybelly' on the same CD.  'Porcelina...' was like 'Soma', soft and graceful then booming and roaring. Definitly one of the best albums of the 90's.  'Bodies' is haunting during the second chorus, listen closely for 'dipise, disarm...'.
B00004U8JV|3.0|Ok, so it's not as good as The first movie. Or the book. Or the film it is named after, but I still think it is quite a good movie. If you don' compare it to those other things, or even the first JP movie, it is a good film in it's own right. I enjoyed it when I bought it, and still do today (The DVD's features aren't spectacular, though). I like dinosaurs, but I think they could have used some variety. T-rex's and Raptors are cool, but there are hundreds of other Dino's to choose from that are just as menacing. Anyway, I encourage people to maybe have a look at this, and if you all ready have, see it again.
B00005OAJ1|1.0|I must admit I bought this cd because of one song, Wonderboy. I saw the video on MTV and was intrigued by the humorous lyrics. The rest of the cd just simply left me skipping through track after track. The music sounds the same song after song, and the skits just aren't funny. To me, they are just being crass for the sake of trying to offend the politically correct. Trust me, I'm no damn prude; however, this album is the epitome of teenage, locker room humor.<br />If you want to listen to \\"offensive\\" music, I would highly recommend Frank Zappa. He is talented, creative, and intelligent. Buy \\" Joe's Garage.\\" Don't buy this album. [...]
B00005QG9J|5.0|Probaly, the best rock CD Iv'e ever bought! As soon as I bought the album, I had already listened to it around 5 to 6 times. ^_^;<BR>I love the whole CD! (...)As a \\"true\\" rocker, If you really like to jam, not to mention by losing your balience by moving your head up and down WAY to fast, I highly recommomend this album. <br />For a long time, I was mostly into rap, hip-hop, that sorta thing. It just seemed that pop and R & B music really took over the music industry (or maybe it was just me) but, this cd truly reminded me of what rock music is ALL about. It about, actual things that many people can relate to, it's far from \\"high school music\\" in which, girl brakes up with guy, girl & guy still got a thing for eath other but they just complain anyways. (it's true.) <br />If you like rock music then, you gotta just get this album! Do yourself a favor, stop reading and buy it today! Or your mattress is free! (kiddin)
B000002UAR|5.0|ABBEY ROAD is undeniably the greatest achievement in musicianship and production from The Beatles.  However, REVOLVER is my pick as best collection of songs.  <br />With this album, The Beatles continue the growth evident on RUBBER SOUL and soar beyond it.  SGT. PEPPER has garnered more attention, but this album was ground-breaking at the time of release and the composing was not only top-notch throughout the entire album, but the whole thing simply bursts with enthusiasm.<br />The album opens with, in my opinion, George Harrison's best song to this point, &quot;Taxman&quot;.  The one who, only a few years later, would lament having to live in the material world, seemed slightly put off by having to surrender so much of his income to the government.  The song was, and is, great.  Next is Paul McCartney's &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;, a surrealistic stretch for Paul and he rises to the occasion beautifully.  The string octet is perfect for the song, by the way.  But my favorite track on the album would have to be John Lennon's &quot;She Said She Said&quot;, which recounts an acid trip.  Trip notwithstanding, the word play in the song is great and it is very interesting musically as well.<br />Even by Beatles standards, there is no filler on this album.  One can almost feel the energy and enthusiasm of artists knowing that they are riding a growth spurt.  I wonder if they knew yet how far it would lead them.
B00005R2M3|3.0|Yes I was a bit disapointed when i listened to her new cd. Maybe I was expecting too much of it. The truth is I did not find the Shakira I used to know, except for her spanish songs. I think she lost her originality and what used to make her so special and unique (starting with the fact that she bleached her hair).<br />Her songs are good, but they sound old. What I mean is that I could recognize old songs that used to play on the radio some years ago. One reviewer already said that one song sounds like one of the Bangles and I totally agree with her. The first one reminded me a lot of Ricky Martin too. <br />I still recomend you to buy this CD, but please if you really want to know this incredible artist and see what she is capable of, go buy her previous albums. Especially &quot;Donde estan los ladrones&quot; and the MTV unplugged.
B000002UB6|5.0|The title of this review refers to a comment made by George Harrison concerning the rehearsals and sessions for this album, all of which were filmed for the documentary of the same name.  In short, this is not a happy album.  Even if one has never seen the film (which shows the deterioration of the group), the mood of the group comes through.  The songs are, for The Beatles, OK (which means that most groups would have sold their souls to have written them), but certainly not their best.  <br />This album was shelved for a year and a half after recording because the whole project was in such disarray.  While it was the last Beatles album to be released, it was actually recorded before ABBEY ROAD.  The heavy hand of Phil Spector is ever-present on this recording (he supervised the mixing and scored the orchestral and choral arrangements).  It is not bad, just somehow different.  <br />As for the individual songs, there are, as always, standouts.  In this case, Paul McCartney's beautiful title track and John Lennon's &quot;Across the Universe&quot;.  The other songs are good, as well.<br />Any Beatles fan will truly appreciate this recording, warts and all.  If you have seen the film, then the album has all the more emotional resonance.
0761536434|5.0|I love to read about video games, and I pretty much devour everything I can find on the subject. So I became excited when I heard about the release of this book, written by one of America's most beloved (and yet perennially controversial) video games journalists. Steve Kent's MSNBC, USA Today and Next Generation columns are always honest and a bit quirky, which is a good combination from my perspective.<br />When I buy books, especially ones with the word &quot;ultimate&quot; in the title, I expect a lot. This book, a properly edited and indexed version of Mr. Kent's self-published &quot;The First Quarter,&quot; absolutely delivers on its title. As a telling of history, The Ultimate History of Video Games is not pretentious, nor is it heavily opinionated, and those are among its greatest assets. The approach: interview nearly every major decision-maker involved in video gaming and let their words tell the 25-plus-year story of the industry. <br />And Ultimate History actually tells the WHOLE story. It's not just about Nintendo. It's not just about 10 years worth of old arcade games. It covers everything -- from before the dawn of video games to just before the releases of the Xbox and Gamecube. Plus it does so without pulling any punches. It's a big thick book with a lot of previously undisclosed information. Fans of The First Quarter will even find some surprising new additions inside, too.<br />This is the sort of book you stay up all night reading and then consult again whenever you're talking with your friends. And it's also the sort of book that ANY person considering a career in video games, especially the gaming business, really has to read. These are the reasons it rates a &quot;buy&quot; instead of a &quot;borrow&quot; or a &quot;skim.&quot; I keep a copy on my shelf at work.
B000002UAU|5.0|Is there anyone alive who doesn't know this album?  Probably not, but I'll throw my opinion into the mix anyway.<br />This album hit the shops after what, for The Beatles, had been an extended absence from the New Release LP wall (10 months).  The press was aflurry with rumors that they were drying up creatively.  Then came SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND.  The press shut up.<br />This was originally going to be a concept album concerning the childhood experiences of the group.  This started with &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; and &quot;Penny Lane&quot; (released as a single prior to the LP) and was to continue from there.  Paul McCartney came up with the idea of pretending to be another band with a &quot;mad name&quot; and came up with the title.  After recording the first two cuts and the reprise near the end, they abandoned the idea.  Even so, this is credited with being rock's first Concept Album.  Oh, well.<br />Concpt or not, it is simply great.  Lennon and McCartney both turn in very solid work as composers (the greatest in the lot being &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;, possibly my favorite Beatles song) and George Martin had the opportunity to stretch as a producer.  Notable by his near-absence as a composer (after three tracks on REVOLVER) is George Harrison.  He was apparently getting more into Indian meditation.  He would give us some of his best work later on.<br />Of course, the playing and singing are super, as always.  But listen to John Lennon's voice on &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;.  It is haunting and, great producer though he is, I do not believe the credit goes exclusively to Mr. Martin.  It still, almost 35 years later, makes the hair on my neck stand up.<br />This was the first Studio Album the Beatles made after deciding to stop touring.  Freed from the obligation to try to duplicate their recorded sound live, they were able to experiment and grow as studio musicians and eventually, as producers themselves.  <br />And it had only been four and a half years since &quot;Love Me Do&quot;.
B00005OAJ1|5.0|I buy a lot of music and am lucky to listen to an entire album by one artist within six months of the purchase.  Tenacious D's eponymous debut, I am happy to say, has been in or near my car's CD player for weeks now.  I've listened to it, front to back at least 3 times and I keep getting new stuff out of the experience.  The between song skits are the ultimate in lo-fi audio improvisation.  If you listen close you can hear the guys breaking up occasionally.  The production values are top notch.  <BR>Each song emulates another band's sounds.  If you are a fan of Dio, The Pixies, Smashing Pumpkins, Styx, Tull, or countless others, you will rock out.  Check out the intro sketch to &quot;Karate&quot;.  This is a must for fans of Jack Black.
B000002UDB|5.0|Most people (probably out of kindness) do not even mention the film to which this album is a soundtrack.  This review is not of a film, however, so onward and upward.<br />First, this is the American version of the MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR release.  The British was a double-EP set (two 45s) containing the songs on Side One (the first six tracks) of the album.  In the US, Capitol Records added the group's singles from the same year (1967) to fill out a whole album.  The result is customarily wonderful.<br />For me, the big standout track here is John Lennon's &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot;.  There is enough there lyrically to sink one's teeth into forever.  It is nonsense and perfect sense at the same time.  Some of the words used aren't even words and yet there is a symmetry to it that can only be described as genius.  While lacking the emotion of much of his other work, this is an intellectual high for the ages.  Apart from that, it's just plain fun.<br />&quot;Penny Lane&quot;, &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;, &quot;The Fool on the Hill&quot;, and &quot;All You Need is Love&quot; are all exceptional as well, which basically means business as usual for The Beatles.
630382336X|5.0|This film captured the very essence of the Beatles.  What made their stardom flourish was there incredible energy, and ernest enjoyment in everthing.  Their charm is contagious, and the chemistry is something that could not be manufactured.  One really sees their wonderful personalities in this film.  This movie just makes you want to smile!
B000002UAO|5.0|In 1965, who saw this one coming?  Sure, the first five albums by The Beatles had been great and each one showed growth and evolution, but this was something special.  This was truly music to be listened to.<br />There is a quiet, almost contemplative feel to this album as a whole.  Musically, the group was expanding (George Harrison plays his recently-acquired sitar), lyrically (&quot;Nowhere Man&quot; was their first song that could not possibly be mistaken for a boy-meets-girl thing), and in production (George Martin was probably having the time of his life).  The result is an album that proved, only three years after their first release, that this was a group of artists to be reckoned with.<br />It is worth mentioning that George Harrison, until now only a minor contributor of songs, turned in two very solid tracks in &quot;Think for Yourself&quot; and &quot;If I Needed Someone&quot; (the latter of which boasts some very nice guitar work).  We would be treated to more of his offerings in the future.<br />RUBBER SOUL was a turning point for The Beatles.  They were already the best-selling pop act in the world.  With this release, they were on their way to the respect and admiration of not only pop fans, but of those who appreciate fine music and literature of all kinds.  <br />But the best was yet to come.
014028009X|4.0|&quot;Bridget Jones' Diary&quot; by Helen Fielding is hilarious!!  I found just about everything in this novel funny.  Although some of the slang, I did find myself confused on!!<br />I definetly related to Bridget, even though I am a man! and am proud of have read this book!! I know what it feels like to want to lose weight, quite smoking or trying to get that certain special someone to notice you or the fear of being completely alone, forever!! lol.<br />This novel is definetly all of that and a box of cigarettes!  And If you like the novel, you might like the movie, too! Check it out.  I can't wait to read &quot;The Edge Of Reason&quot;
B000002UAX|5.0|This album, despite the title (officially THE BEATLES), marked the beginning of the end for the group.  This double-disc set is more a collection of solo cuts than it is a group effort, and that is apparent throughout.<br />The statements above should not be construed as criticism, merely observation, for the songs (most of them, anyway) stand alongside their other great achievements.  This album actually has a bigger variety of musical styles than any of their previous efforts, from vintage Beach Boys (&quot;Back in the USSR&quot;) to a 1930s-era 78 (&quot;Honey Pie&quot;) to gut-wrenching melancholy (&quot;Yer Blues&quot;) to sonic experiments (&quot;Revolution 9&quot;), etc.  <br />This is, being a Beatles album, a great recording.  But one senses restlessness starting to set in.  This would become obvious a short time later.
B00005Q66T|5.0|Reigning pop queen MADONNA finally releases a follow-up to her enormously popular cd - THE IMMACULATE COLLECTION. This time, GHV2 showcases some of her best hits of the early 90s to her most recent hits off MUSIC. Sure, it's definitely missing a couple classic tunes in between, but overall - this should be a nice treat to all pop music fans. The insert booklet is filled with tons of tiny images of Madonna's famous fashion styles. Pick this up !
B000002UB3|5.0|ABBEY ROAD marked the last time that John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr would ever go into a recording studio together to record as The Beatles, and they knew it.  In THE BEATLES ANTHOLOGY video collection (highly recommended, by the way), they admit that they wanted to do one last, better album than LET IT BE for their swansong.  They succeeded admirably.<br />Aside from the writing (which was always superior), the production and the playing are top-notch.  Paul McCartney absolutely shines on bass throughout--listen to his work on &quot;Come Together&quot;, &quot;Something&quot;, and &quot;I Want You&quot; in particular.  George Harrison's guitar work, always good, had evolved into greatness on this release.  George Harrison had also come very much into his own as a composer by this time, no longer in the shadow of the Lennon-McCartney legacy.  Proof of this is in his contributions (&quot;Something&quot; and &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot;).  John Lennon even gives us a glimpse of the primal nature of his first post-Beatles release in &quot;I Want You&quot;.  And even Ringo Starr, who had only composed one song for the group previously, gives us a charming sequel to &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; with &quot;Octopus' Garden&quot;.<br />It is always a point of contention among Beatles fans which is their best album.  However, for musicianship and production alone, this one stands above the others.  It has the almost poingnant feel of a farewell and the celebration of freedom simultaneously, for, truth be told, The Beatles had simply outgrown the structure of the group.  While they would all have solo careers marked by greatness and mediocrity (more of the former than the latter in all cases), they would shortly record albums that could not have been made within the context of the group.  So this was their final hour of greatness together.  And they made the most of it.  It is only fitting that the song suite on Side Two (I know it's a CD, butI still remember the LP sequencing) ends with Paul McCartney singing, &quot;And in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make.&quot;<br />And make it, they did.
B00005LMBK|5.0|To those who think that Gorillaz are just a marketing scheme, I can say with confidence that they are wrong. Not only are the videos fun and the website rockin', but the CD is a surprise. It covers many genres, from hip-hop to punk. The beats are catchy and fused well with the lyrics. <br />The particular CD I have is apparently the UK version, since it has remixes of &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot; and &quot;19-2000&quot;, so I can't speak for &quot;Dracula&quot; and &quot;Left-Hand Suzuki Method&quot;, but I can definately say that the main portion of the CD rocks.
6305073341|5.0|Paul Verhoeven's original 'Robocop' ain't exactly a cinematic masterpiece. I mean, sure the story feels a little dry and cliched these days. But back in 1987, there really wasn't too many movies being made like this an' the concept actually felt wholly original. I went to see this as a kid when it was first released, before I was any kind of film buff or had any inkling about the finer aspects of cimena, an' I loved it. Back then, this was my favorite movie. I had the toys, the comic books, the T-shirts, I mean the whole shabang. It was the first R-rated film I ever saw in the theater, a pretty disturbing feat, considerin' the extreme gore and violence in the movie. It was so shocking that the MPAA Code and Ratings Administration requested trims in it. I can even remember seeing 20/20 an' primetime news specials with right AND left wing reactionaries who were attacking this movie's non-conformist values and excessive violence. Considerin' these facts, it might be very troubling to some when I say that this film holds a truly special place with me, but it does. It reminds me of my childhood. I mean, face it, this film was a huge hit that summer an' turned into sumpin' of a cult franchise. So, yea, of course little kids such as myself at the time were going to see it.     But all controversy and nostalgia aside, this is a real strong an' potent sci-fi film in its own right. Course is' in some ways harder to categorize than jus' sayin' 'sci-fi'. There's comedy in the movie, hell, even slapstick comedy. There's romance. There's a certain amount of philosophy, centering on the question, What is a man? An' there is pointed social satire lyin' beneath in the idea that in this unspecified future time, out-of-control gang terror that has resulted in a series of brutal cop killings could be solved by a big corporation called Omni Consumer Products (OCP) that wants to market a robot-cop. By combining state-of-the-art robotics with a human brain they feel they will have the PERFECT law enforcement officer, and when a hero cop is killed in the line of duty they jump at the oppurtunity. One'a the most disturbing and violent scenes in fact is the aforementioned brutal shooting that sets the events in motion. Definitely NOT something I, or anyone for that matter, should have seen as a child. So if you have children, keep them away from it (You don't want them to end up like me).     It's also kinda interesting to note that the most sensitive and emotional aspect of the movie comes from the robot itself as Robocop struggles to hold on to his last remaining bit of humanity (his memory), while relentlessly seeking vengeance on the drug-dealin' crooks who murdered him. My favorite scenes are the ones where the memories of who he was begin flooding back to him, an' you can see him slowly resenting what he has become. Particularly chilling is the moments when he's walking through his old house which is for sale an' every room, every nook and cranny brings back warm memories of his wife and son. You can see real pain just in Robocop's gestures and the way his mouth gapes at what he is slowly realizing. That his whole life had been viciously taken from him.     I suppose this film can partly be blamed for the desensitization of today's youth when it comes to violence in the movies. I mean, it is literally stomach-turning in several scenes, but that shouldn't take away from the fact that it is really a great movie, with a fascinating story an' concept as well. The two sequels pale in comparison.     I'm amazed at the fact that this movie has managed to retain a certain edge and flair in its satirical nature after all this time. That alone is enough to make me highly reccomend it to anyone. I'd consider it HANDS-DOWN the BEST science fiction film of the 1980s (yes, even better than 'Blade Runner' an' 'the Terminator').
B00004STPT|5.0|I bought this score before I saw the movie because I love Hans Zimmer and it surpassed anything I'd heard from him before. It's a nice mix of fast (or action) pieces, and slow dramatic ones. The base theme throughout them is wonderful. Anyone that liked the theme to Broken Arrow or The Thin Red Line should love this one because it highlights some key elements of both. Now having seen the movie I can honestly say that they did pick the best pieces of the score for this CD. A must have for any movie score buff.
B000002JOH|5.0|if you dont have VDOP in your c.d. collection, and you love heavy metal you are missing out! VDOP is a must have for any heavy metal enthusiasts. i have been a huge PANTERA fan since 1991, and i love them now more than ever. VDOP was a heavy metal masterpiece way before its time! back in 1992 when it debued, no one had that heavy of a sound and that style of a sound. not even METALLICA sounded that good! my all time favorite PANTERA song is without a doubt 'A NEW LEVEL', this is a heavy song and DIMEBAG pulls off the heaviest riff. seeing them live makes you appreciate them even more!!! so i would recommend VULGAR DISPLAY OF POWER for anybody who listens to music at all not just us METALHEADS!!! PANTERA RULES- STRONGER THAN ALL!!!!!!!!!!!
B00003CXRM|5.0|The first time I saw this movie I arrived late at the theatre, and not knowing about that the movie was based on Homer's &quot;Odyssey&quot;, or that it was set in the 1930's (or so), I wasn't influenced by any expectations of this movie.  The first time around, I thought it was witty and funny, but a mediocre film.<br />I finally got around to watching it a second time all the way through.  Since then, I have become a Coen affecionado, discovering more and more the subtle yet hilarious comedy that the Coen brothers seem to flavor all their movies with.  I HAD to go out and buy this film, and I've watched the movie about a dozen times now, finding it more funny every time.  One of my most-watched DVD's in my collection.<br />I recommend giving it a try - and if you've seen it once and didn't like it, I recommend giving it a second chance.
0064407667|5.0|Wow! This book is not your average! (...), the kids are orfans and this is just the first book of many more to come. This book had action going the whole time and the plot was amazing! I really think Lemony Snicket is a great writer and really think you should read this book!!
630460291X|1.0|I have seen this movie in theatres as a teen when it first came out, and even then I found it contrived and silly. A miscast lead in Costner aside, the movie's glaring use of political correctness and blatant over-dramatization of its plot and characters in order to harp on the sentiments of the audience made me feel queasy. Add to this a plethora of historical inaccuracies, and  you have a movie that can't even be saved by its well-staged action scenes. This film is for audience willing to suspend the use of their brains for a while and immerse themselves in sticky Hollywood bonanza, but not much beyond. The movie spawned a parody, &quot;Men in Tights&quot;, and it richly deserved it.
B000050XEI|5.0|Enya continues to enchant me.  I have been captivated by her haunting melodies since the release of her Watermark album in 1988.<br />From Watermark to A Day Without Rain, Enya has always given me two or more tracks that rivited my attention and evoked emotion. Sometimes it has merely been an instrumental with an enchanting rhythm and that certain melodic, but haunting backdrop.  When the track finishes, I have found myself wiping an unexplainable, but cleansing and refreshing tear from my cheek, and I feel as though I have traveled somewhere distant in the span of a few minutes.<br />A Day Without Rain is consistent with everything wonderful I have come to expect from Enya Ryan.  I hope she never stops composing her special heart-touching style of music.
0812550706|5.0|As a reader of philosophical and thoughful science fiction , I first expected Ender's Game to be yet another action packed but lacking in plot novel about smashing an invading race of aliens into smithereens. Boy was I wrong !  Reading this book was like looking in the mirror. Card skillfully decribes his characters and their actions, and paints an accurate portrait of bright ambitious young people involved in psycological struggle.  <BR>     If a tad too flattering to it's subjects and their abilities , the book does present interesting perspectives on millitary and political strategy. However, be prepared for an ending that screams &quot;sequel &quot; , and rather skeletal descriptions of the main adult characters. A particularily interesting subplot involves one of the book's few female characters and her malevolent brother trying to manipulate international politics through publishing their writings on the internet. If far fetched, this subplot does provide interesting questions for an increasing digital age.<BR>     I highly recommend Ender's Game , especially for intelligent younger readers who could empathize more directly with the characters. This book seems to break out of the traditional boundaries of the science fiction genre and provides an outstanding example of  fiction that is both entertaining and thought provoking.
B00005QK3W|5.0|I am stunned by this work. I have been a McCartney fan for a long time but I had gone off his work lately. McCartney II was the last album that really had some original music on it in my opinion. Tug of War, Flowers in the Dirt, Flaming Pie were all nice, with some gems here and there, but inevitably it always felt a bit lazy to me. There simply wasn't an edge to it. It all seemed to obviously targeted at a common denominator sort of audience. <BR>Sometimes, however, this man is capable of musical magic. It's something completely inexplicable, because the material itself seems almost always deceptively simple (It's similar to Mozart's music in this respect). <br />I can tell you the magic flows freely on this CD. Especially the vocal timing and delivery is breathtaking in places. Don't be fooled by the seemingly haphazard arrangements either. There is an amazing subtlety in some of the details. For instance, on 'I do' the sound of bells resonates beautifully with the passage work in the brass later. The string quartet at the end of 'It must have been magic', interrupted by drum fills is another example. That song deserves some special mention anyway. It seems to not only describe the night he met his wife, but also the day she died. There is a sense of 'beyond what one can emotionally fathom' in the vocal here which actually made me break down in tears at the first listen. 'From a lover to a friend' is one of these songs that sounds simple at first but starts haunting you after a few listens. It communicates an emotion that is on a strange edge between a state of sadness and dispair and a enlightened resignation (From a lover to a friend indeed... sometimes his lyrics are not that silly.) 'Heather' is an instrumental delight of spring freshness culminating in a little poem of devotion (the gesture reminds me somehow of late mediaeval 'courtly love' songs.. go figure that!. The music, btw, sounds like something that he could have composed in the 70s. On top of that,the arrangement here is in typical Beatlesque layering fashion.)<BR>The long jam 'rinse the raindrops' has some gorgous rhythmic effects where the slow vocal plays off the pounding rhythm of the band, creating a sense similar to looking at a slow motion image. And then...  back from a leave of absence...  there's the melodic bass lines providing counterpoint to the main melody brought to you by their inventor. I have always been a sucker for those. <BR> <BR>In general, the man seems to be driven on this CD in a way that I haven't heard in a long time. Everything has emotional edge to it.. Unfortunately, it really seems true that mr. McCartney's magic needs some personal hardship to come pouring out freely. But we're the ones benefitting from it. Don't miss this. This may be the last classic by one of the most capable musicians/composers of this century. <br />p.s.<BR>Freedom should have been left off this CD in my opinion. It's weak. It tries to be a singalong, but it isn't because the chorus is actually quite hard to sing (I'm actually impressed with McCartney, 59, pulling this off cleanly) Anyway, I don't doubt that it's meant very well but it seems McCartney's attempt at a 'give peace a chance' and that's just not his thing. It's misplaced on the album.
B00003CXZ1|5.0|I can't say enough good things.  I promis not to make this too boring. But it was a really good movie.  I liked the story eventough there could of been more puzzles, it was really good.  it has funny parts too.  But the acton is great and I her that the DVD has some cool speasil features<BR>thats it.

0679735909|4.0|_Possession_ tells a story within a story.  The &quot;outer&quot; story involves two academics who work together in an uneasy partnership to investigate a love affair between the two poets that they respectively study.  Roland is an awkward and poverty-stricken grad student who has no job prospects and a girlfriend he is shamefully unable to appreciate; Maud is a standoffish and icy professor who keeps her inner self veiled for reasons of her own.  Together they follow the paper trail left by the two poets, and in those letters and poems lie the second story, the story of an acclaimed Romantic poet and his more obscure friend, a reclusive female poet who writes something like Dickinson most of the time.  Roland and Maud are trying to be the first to publish their discovery, so they do some impulsive things and create a lot of chaos as they try to keep other professors from scooping them.  Woven into all this literary jumble is the tale of the fairy shapeshifter Melusine; the female poet wrote an epic about her, and both the poet and Maud play the role of Melusine, in various ways, in their own lives.  <br />This isn't a light read, by any means.  I always say that I have two different moods when it comes to reading.  Sometimes I just want to unwind and be entertained; any amusing brain-candy will do.  In other moods, I want to be intellectually challenged.  This book is for the latter mood.
B00005R2M3|5.0|\\"Laundry Service\\" is quite possibly Shakira's best album to date. It is a blend of sexy, intelligent, and voracious undiluted Rock music with a touch of world beat(The only negative criticism is that Shakira had Gloria Estefan translate her Spanish language lyrics into English; Couldn't she have asked someone who really knows how to write good English lyrics, ie, Sting, Billy Joel, Paul McCartney, Sheryl Crowe, Madonna, etc.? Besides, didn't Gloria Estefan already have her share of butchering lyrics with nauseating translations for Ricky Martin and Jon Secada?). How often are we fortunate enough to have all the admirable and desirable qualities in just one artist (Selena, Michael Jackson, Elvis)? It is not common to have an artist that not only has a great voice (She can ocassionally sound like Linda Ronstadt or Selena), but can also dance and perform quite well at the same time. One can think of many artists who can dance, but can't really sing all that well (Madonna, Janet, Britney). One can also conjure up images of those great voices who can't dance, but  can sing incredibly well (Jon Secada, Marc Anthony, Whitney, Mariah). Shakira is one of those rare artists that can do it all; Compose music, play guitar, arrange, produce, sing, dance and perform, while all the while, writing lyrics that rival the likes of Sting and Billy Joel in poetic quality. She executes this album with originality and authority. There is not a bad song on this CD, from '\\"Whenever, Wherever'\\" to \\"Underneath your Clothes.\\"  Buy it and get \\"Ready for the Good Times!\\"    p.s. To Gloria Estefan: PLEASE STOP Translating lyrics for artists. If you want to butcher someones lyrics in a translation, go ahead and ruin your own songs.
6300216268|5.0|Pssssssssstt. What a classic this film is!  I loved it the 1st time I viewed it and with each addtional viewing I find something more, especially with the genius performance of Ruth Gordon.  Her character is a genuine crack up with eccentric interests, wonderfully funny and sexy body movements and a wonderful view of life, right down (or up) to her &quot;timed exit&quot;.  Only Ruth Gordon could make hilarious the fact that her character carries a multitude of keys so she will never have to worry about not having the correct key when she needs to steal a vehicle - what genius.  Her character is right out in front of Life, which I find contagious no matter how many times I view the movie.  Obviously, I cannot say enough about this character actress.  If you don't care for the character she plays in this movie, try her in another - the one with Clint Eastwood.  As for the fake suicides included in this movie - they were outstandingly funny and dark. Kudos to the author of the story!
B00005B36H|4.0|Best Features:<BR>1. Maynard James Keenan screams at the top of his lungs for over thirteen seconds straight on the opener, &quot;The Gudge.&quot; Coming towards the end of the approximately eight and a half minute track, the scream serves its purpose well. The song has a distinct method about it: it starts off reasonably soft, and from then on, it continues to gain momentum, not unlike a snowball rolling down hill. The scream towards the end is the release that the listener is expecting. All that raw emotion pushed into one heartfelt roar. Beautiful<br />2. The songs flow very well. The best example of this is the transition from &quot;Parabol&quot;, a soft acoustic based instrumental, to &quot;Parabola&quot; which is a metal version of the previous track. <br />3. Every member of the band is obviously extremely talented, and each member demonstrates this throughout the CD (such as the enigmatic bassline of &quot;Schism&quot;).<br />Worst Features: <BR>1. The only real complaint I have is that it was not wise to put such long and repetive intrumentals towards the end. After track 9, I usually switch CD's.
B00005OM4N|5.0|&quot;Britney&quot; is an excellent cd. It has a much funkier and mature sound than her previous attempts. Each song holds it's own and there's no limit to variety. She tries it all - pop, r&amp;b, dance. Though she doesnt have the most able voice, she still manages to produce good vocals in every song. This one is definately one to buy.
B00003CWN2|5.0|This film leaves one haunted and stunned.  It is, perhaps one of the most 'real' films I have ever seen. Experienced, actually...felt, lived through.<br />Somehow, director Kimberly Pierce has created a world so starkly realistic, that one feels as if one is there.  Hilary Swank is so very much Brandon, the character is...just IS.  Chloe Sevigny astonishes as well.  The entire cast simply 'live' their respective roles.<br />I find it odd that director Pierce was overlooked by the DGA in its nominations.  The film is a cautionary, all too vivid portait/tale of our times.  One does not easily forget, nor does one leave this film without, without a sense of awe, stunned disbelief and horror -- knowing how all too true the senselessness of ignorance remains, yet today. A must...for its lessons yet unlearned.  A must for anyone who appreciates extroadinary talent, provoking thought and fodder for what the art of 'directing' and 'acting' CAN accomplish.  Bravo and Beware...but 'see', 'learn' and not forget easily.
B00000FZQ8|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite scifi/pro-environment movies.  Bruce Dern rocks.  It has great robots.
B00005KFUM|4.0|Many cast off Muse as Radiohead wannabes. No one can be Radiohead, but Muse does a good job of taking that angst-ridden sound and forging some new and interesting melodies. Lots of cool keyboard riffs, and some rocking raw guitar drive this record beyond just another rip-off, like Travis. Buy this record.
B000002BVN|3.0|This CD slipped by pretty much ignored, maybe that isn't so surprising as it can hardly be classed as a true MJ album.<br />It's built on the somewhat shaky premise of five new songs coupled with remixes from the HIStory album's disc two.<br />Well the new material in itself is not all that impressive. Although not necessarily bad the title track (Blood On The Dancefloor) is average MJ fare and sounds like it could be an outtake from &quot;Dangerous&quot;. Teddy Riley on the co-write could well point to just that, it's hardly a track to base a new album around, hence we receive it in this more EP based format.<br />&quot;Morphine&quot; is slightly better and combines some nice segments in it's rocky format. It sounds similar to some of the HIStory material.  <br />&quot;Superfly Sister&quot; has strong Prince influence and is quite funky. However it still has a demo like feel and could be no more than a B-side in relation to MJ's past output.<br />&quot;Ghosts&quot; and &quot;Is It Scary&quot; are both taken from MJ's short Movie (Ghosts) and contain some good moments that hark back to MJ on full cylinders. Sadly both also still come out sounding half-hearted.<br />I'm not a big fan of &quot;Dance remixes&quot; and although they may work in a club with a packed dancefloor, would you really want to listen repeatedly to these extended mixes in your house? So unsurprisingly little else of &quot;HIStory In The Mix&quot; impresses me. Give me the original versions of the excellent &quot;Stranger In Moscow&quot;, &quot;You Are Not Alone&quot;, &quot;Earth Song&quot; etc every time!<br />The Jam and Lewis &quot;Scream Louder&quot; remix is quite funky with it's added guitar however and rates comparingly to &quot;Scream&quot;. Aside from that only the &quot;Earth Song&quot; and &quot;You Are Not Alone&quot; re-makes seem to work in any capacity. Although obviously never rivalling the previous incarnations so why bother?<br />This CD may appeal to both Club DJ's and hardcoreclubbers with a passion for MJ but for me personally I won't come back to this CD anywhere near as often as his other &quot;regular&quot; albums.
B000002J1U|5.0|Amazing how unlimited the range was for rock in the 1970's. Nowadays, you can't make an almost all-acoustic album if you're in a hard-rock band. Why not? For Zeppelin fans who like Whole lotta love and Comminication Breakdown, this ain't for you. For people who liked Ramble on, and Your Time Is Gonna Come, you will be pleased:<br />1.Immigration Song-The excellent single on the album. Only 5 riffs, and an excellent walking bass line. Nice echo. 5/5<br />2.Friends-Intresting. Sounds like something Ravi Shanker would do. Nice pot pourri like sound. 4/5<br />3.Celebration Day-Weird. Good chord usage for the intro. A really feel-good song on the album. 4/5<br />4.Since I've Been Loving You-Excellent. A milestone in their carrer. Amazing jazz-blues song. Good singing by Plant. Good. 5/5<br />5.Out On The Tiles-Good fast bluesy song. Really great drumming from Bonham. Probably the most fun song they've done. 4/5<br />6.Gallows Pole-The best song on the album, and it makes a change in the album, making the album all-acoustic. Really great ending. Very slow at first, then very fast. Nice banjo usage. 5/5<br />7.Tangerine-really country. You'd imagine an old country band in a sleazy bar playing this. It's ok. 3/5<br />8.That's the Way-This is the best ballad on the album. Really dreamy, made me almost fall asleep. That's not a bad thing, though! Really peaceful. 5/5<br />9.Bron-Yr-Aur Stomp-Very folkish. Good singing by Robert. This song's about a dog. How many rock bands do that?<br />10.Hats Off To (Roy) Harper-Weird. The album seems like it's gonna explode in the intro. Nice bottleneck usage. Weird vibrato usage in the vocals. 5/5<br />Great album, and the best was yet to come from Led Zeppelin.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|Coupling the new phenomenon of music videos with exceptional pop music meant that &quot;Thriller&quot; was well supported by the rising TV station MTV. This would obviously open him up to a big audience, but who could have thought it would long stand as the best seller of all time? In an industry ravaged by tape copying the sales here kept pop music alive near enough.<br />The album opens with the uptempo funk pop of &quot;Wanna Be Starting Something&quot;, mixture of 80s production technique and African chants all couple to make this a standout.<br />My other album favourite would be the immortal &quot;Billy Jean&quot; in which we first see the paranoid Michael of future years. At this time he wonders if the baby is his as &quot;Billy&quot; alleges.

B00003CX5P|5.0|Star Wars fans rejoice, the first DVD in the series has finally been released after a traditional Lucasfilm wait. First off let me say that you have not seen Star Wars until you have experienced this DVD. I have all the currently released VHS Star Wars video's and I always recognized a grainy, blurry quality to the original trilogy as well as Episode One, now the video is crystal clear. Even on my computer's DVD player (which is theoretically lower quality than a hardware player), the picture is like the movie theater, but twice as clear. Also adding to the theater effect is one of the first DVD's that includes the Dolby Surround 5.1 EX soundtrack to it. This makes itself present in the Podrace and the last battles between the Gungans and TF, as well as the lightsaber battle. One of the main reasons I bought this was because of the deleated scenes. Lucasfilm even added about 3 min. of bonus footage to the final version, including some really excellent additions to the Podrace. The other behind the scenes featurettes on the 2nd disc are amazing. The main behind the scene feature is about 1hr long! I bought this a week ago and I still have not seen all the bonus features. Never have I seen a DVD so well crafted. Another feature that should be mentioned is that with this DVD, you can see Star Wars: Episode Two trailers exclusivley, before they are released to the theaters if you have a DVD-ROM and internet access.  This DVD is not only a required part of a Star War's fan collection, it should be included in any DVD owners collection.
B0000025RI|5.0|Coupling the new phenomenon of music videos with exceptional pop music meant that &quot;Thriller&quot; was well supported by the rising TV station MTV. This would obviously open him up to a big audience, but who could have thought it would long stand as the best seller of all time? In an industry ravaged by tape copying the sales here kept pop music alive near enough.<br />The album opens with the uptempo funk pop of &quot;Wanna Be Starting Something&quot;, mixture of 80s production technique and African chants all couple to make this a standout.<br />My other album favourite would be the immortal &quot;Billy Jean&quot; in which we first see the paranoid Michael of future years. At this time he wonders if the baby is his as &quot;Billy&quot; alleges. It is a classic pop song and who could forget his Motown TV performance of it or the video?<br />&quot;The Girl Is Mine&quot; is a litle embarassing in parts and the horror movie soaked title track &quot;Thriller&quot; does spoil the album's flow a little, but both have merit and the later's video made a massive impact.<br />Dance tracks like &quot;Beat It&quot; (With it's Van Halen guitar solo), &quot;Baby Be Mine&quot; and &quot;P.Y.T&quot; all hit the spot and contain aspects of the feel good nature found in classic previous effort &quot;Off The Wall&quot;.<br />We also get &quot;The Lady In My Life&quot; to close out the LP and keep ballad fans happy with it's lush melody.<br />Nothing about this album can be understated.

B00005OM4N|5.0|Britney is a great album. I am a Slave for You, is a great song to dance to. I'm not a girl, not Yet a woman is a ballad that many teenagers can relate to. What its like to be me is a partial duet between Brit and her beau Justin Timberlake, its a great rock/hiphop song with jerky beats and great lyrics. Anticipating is also a great song with hints of a past era of music, great to dance to! The cover of Joan Jett's I Love Rock and Roll is amazing with great beats and funky lyrics. Overall Britney surpassed all the ratings its got so far its great!!!!!

B00000BKDS|2.0|I grew up listening to Iron Maiden in my early teens, sort of grew out of it after that, but I get a bit nostalgic when I hear the songs now.<br />Listening to this album now it is interesting to hear just how much of the fast punk sound is in it! Anyone who has had the opportunity to hear the Soundhouse tapes will notice that the punk influence is even more pronounced there! Iron Maiden was a way different band before they got signed, and their debut album points a little to where they came from.<br />Iron Maiden's other influences are evident on this recording; I hear glimpses of early Rush (particularly Steve Harris' bass lines), Wishbone Ash and Black Sabbath.<br />Curiously, Paul DiAnno's vocals are much better on this album than on the next release, 'Killers'. Vocally, the best performance is on the ballad 'Strange World' where he gets to sing more melodically.<br />This album is full of catchy head banger classics like 'Prowler', 'Running Free' and 'Charlotte the Harlot' as well as some longer pseudo-epics like Phantom of the Opera (memorable opening riff) and Transylvania.<br />Melodically and harmonically the material is fairly simple and predictable. Lots of straight diatonic harmony over mostly Aeolian modal material--this is a heavy metal staple. Iron Maiden also really exploit the 'twin guitar' harmonised melody line sound--the melody usually harmonised a diatonic third above. In fact they did it so much, it became a signature sound of theirs.<br />The solos on this album are mostly of the messy noodling variety. On the upshot, Dave Murray does play with a lot of passion. As with all Maiden albums the bass is fairly high in the mix. Steve Harris has always had a fairly unique sound although his influences are obvious on this recording: Geddy Lee and Chris Squire in particular. Clive Burr's drumming is solid and suits the direction of the music on this recording. The overall sound production of this album is similar to the late 70s Judas Priest sound.<br/>Iron Maiden were always going to be successful, they had the right sound and the right time for hard rock and heavy metal audiences of the early 80s. It would be another couple of years before they really hit the big time but this was certainly an auspicious beginning.<br />This album a good document of the evolution of hard rock/heavy metal during the late 70s and early 80s.
B00005U122|5.0|I dont need to watch the video i was there! The way Roger performed is truly one of his best performances next to the WALL This DVD took to long for it to come out on DVD for the fans and now the people who missed the show will see what they missed out on. Roger should take floyd back!! <BR>I hope you all enjoy this Show!!!!!!!!!!!<BR>Im buying this one myself!
B00000IAU3|3.0|Dido's album is all pleasant music that some might find a little bland (no big crashes or speedy beats etc). But this girl actually s i n g s for real - not that faux pop singing that pop stars like Britney Spears do, and not that faux rock singing that rock stars like Courtney Love do. And I heard she writes her own songs. And she's really nice and modest (almost shy) in interviews. Therefore, I sometimes listen to this CD.
B00005OLY5|5.0|I can say truly that I have never met anyone who did not like the movie Willow.  I've been a fan since the first time I saw it some 10+ years ago.<br />The amazing scenery, the antics of Willow and the comedy of the brownies Rool and Franjean all blend well to make this a great film.  An extra touch is an earlier role by Val Kilmer and fans of his will definately not be disappointed at seeing this film.<br />I would recommend this film to anyone who even has the slightest interest in the fantasy genre.  It is truly a classic.<br />-Zilean
B00001NFCY|4.0|This album is well balanced. A near perfect mix of hard rockers, ballads, and well crafted pop songs.  It's a heartfelt, honest album about life.  From the decisions we all face about our future (Are you Ready?), the shallowness of beauty (Beautiful), the fleetingness of youth (Never Die), realising you're part of something greater when you bring life into the world (With Arms Wide Open), dreaming of a better world (Higher), and the bond between each of us (Inside Us All).<br />Combine epic lyrics with first rate musicianship and that is the essence of Human Clay.  Stapp expresses himself honestly without coming off pretentious or preachy.  He offers his thoughts, but never an answer.  Tremonti excels himself here with his guitar skills.  He clearly shows off his influences (Led Zeppelin, the Doors, Metallica), but manages to make his style clearly his own.  Phillips is solid behind the drum kit, and Marshall pounds his bass for all it's worth.<br />Overall this album proves that Creed is more than just another rock band.  They aren't a flash in the pan - they are here to stay.  Two years after I first got this album I still listent to in on a regular basis.  They show musical talents and song writing skills that are amazing.  And this is only their second effort.  I await Weathered with eager ears.
B00004Z459|5.0|I got this CD about a month ago and all I have to say is: this IS the best CD I have ever heard. You NEVER get tired of the songs and they all usually make you jump up and sing. I'm listening to it right now! I'm hooked on it and I'm sure you'll be too! [buy this cd!] Oh yeah and if you are one of those people who think just because Linkin Park's annitials are almost the same as Limp Bizkit's [LP+LB] means that Linkin Park is copying Limp Bizkit, well buy this CD and you'll see that Limp Bizkit is NOTHING like Linkin Park!
0790731983|5.0|The ultimate performance by Liza Minnelli is only one reason why this movie is one of the best ever. A great drama/romance/musical/comedy blending all elements seamlessly. The fabulous musical numbers work as a side commentary to the story. You simply cannot take your eyes off Minnelli, or Joel Grey. The supporting cast of Michael York, Marisa Berenson, Fritz Wepper, Helmut Griem are also perfect. Have a laugh, have a cry, but you will enjoy this classic, telling the story of an Americal chorus girl looking for a breakthrough in Berlin just prior to the nazi uprising. Seeking love yet clinging to her independence, Sally tries to balance her relationships while another couple fight to be together despite the dangers of their religiously at-odds union. Simply brilliant.
B00003CXXS|4.0|I didn't expect much coming into this, but I have to say that it was a pretty good action/thriller.  The plot is actually decent, with a divorced couple trying to find their son and her boyfriend.  Sam Neill is good as usual, and Laura Dern makes a brief, but welcome cameo.  The action sequences are outstanding, particularly the part in the pterodactyl cage.  This is a very intense, very adrenalizing movie that anyone who enjoys a good thrill ride will love.  It's already on my wish list.
0783225857|5.0|I have always loved this movie &amp; I would highly recommend it.  They just don't make movies like this anymore.
0446677450|3.0|First of all, I should say \\"Robert is a good story teller!\\"<br />Following facts are very obvious if you read this book completely.<br />1. There was actually nobody called Rich Dad for Robert.<BR>2. Robert is not yet retired. His new business is making millions<BR>by writing books on personal finance!<BR>3. He borrows ideas from best selling books,compiling those ideas<BR>nicely with the help of a story and repeat the same many times.<br />So if you are a good reader, go to a bookshop (...) sit there, finish reading ....and start thinking how to write a best selling book!.
0767832248|5.0|does it even need to be said? a brilliant movie, a brilliant book. i've just seen it for the fourth time, and it is still as poignant, as stunning, as tragic, as beautiful, and as amazing as it was the first.
B00003CXZ1|4.0|I didn't bother to go see this movie in the theaters because I wasn't expecting it to be good and I can't pause or rewind the shower scene there either. So I rented it instead. The first scence with the robot thing turned out to be a pleasent surprise. It was a pretty cool action sequence. Same with the part when those GI guys come it trying to steal the clock. But after that the movie was really boring, I don't play the video games so I guess I should have been expecting more of an adventerous movie than an action packed movie. Oh well, at least Angelina Jolie looks awesome.
0913022101|4.0|Mein Kampf should be required reading for every American citizen. Here, clearly written in these pages, are the seeds of hatred that destroyed not only its author but his entire country.There need never be a better object lesson about the virus of hatred and the inevitable results it brings to anyone and any society that allows it to take root.

B00004RF97|5.0|Tracy Samantha Lord (Katherine Hepburn), a High Society millionairess, is about to be married to George Kittridge (John Howard) a self-made mining executive, when, unannounced, her first husband, C.K. Dexter-Haven (Cary Grant), who she hasnt seen for two years, appears on the scene. He has brought with him a scandal sheet reporter, Macauley Conner (James Stewart), and his photographer-cum-girl friend Elizabeth Imbrie (Ruth Hussey), who want to do a insider, expose piece on the family. Under duress he explains that he was forced into bringing them a long by the magazines editor who had threatened, if he refused  to comply, to publish a scandalous story about her fathers liaison with a Parisian dancer. Outraged, Tracy and her young sister Dinah (a very funny performance from Virginia Weidler) put on a show and present themselves as deranged eccentrics, leaving Conner and friend baffled and bemused. Later, he comes across Tracy in the local library reading a book of his short stories and they both see each other in an entirely fresh light.<br />We are given an insight into the character of George Kittridge at the beginning of the film when he comes along immaculately dressed in jodhpurs looking like a tailors dummy. Tracy, repelled, immediately pushes him over into the dirt just to make him look more human. And then his blundering attempts to get astride a horse are hilarious. He is handsome and well-spoken and by normal standards attractive, but with Dexter and Macauley in the vicinity he appears stolid, self-important and humourless. We just know that Tracy will not marry  him.<br />Its ironic that Grant, here as ever playing the sophisticate, should himself have come from a poor, lower-middle-class family and been poorly educated. Yet, he still managed to create for himself this marvellous screen persona. And in this film we have the quintessential Grant. He was here at his peak; suave, smooth, unruffled, in control, always amused and amusing and with a repertoire of gently mocking facial expressions. And he made it seem so easy - too easy, which is probably why Stewart beat him to the Oscar. Hepburn got a nomination and so did Hussey and yet neither were more deserving than Grant.<br />Hepburn as always gives a great performance, although it seems to me remarkable that starting out with such physical disadvantages she was able to   achieve star status. Her character is cruelly criticised in the film for thinking of herself as a Goddess and behaving like one; cold distant and hardly human. But, physically, with her thin face and slight figure, she is a long way from being anyones idea of a Goddess. Nor, until you get used to it, is her hard, high-pitched voice easy on the ear. Little wonder then that up to this point she was thought to be box-office poison.<br />There are a few other occasions in the film when I had difficulty suspending disbelief and when the film seemed to take itself too seriously resulting in stagy artificial dialogue, but on the whole it is an enjoyable film, well acted, well scripted and well worth seeing. Up to the last minute we are made to wonder  who will marry whom. But all our expectations and wishes come true with a nicely satisfying happy ending - despite Macauleys bit of cruelty. To tell someone you love them when someone else who loves you is standing at your elbow is surely cruel is it not?
0783244320|5.0|While this is my first DVD, I have rented a few and this one is fun.  Got it for my wife who loves Star Trek - we both like the movie a lot and got a kick out of it. There are extra scenes included and a cool interface.  Glad I ordered it.  Classic movie.
B00005U122|5.0|Well... since the dvd hasn't been realesed yet... I havent seen it... but I when to three shows... and it was amazing... I just can't wait to see it again...<br /> if you're planing to buy any of pink floyd videos... don't. the only worthy is live at pompeii... but do not buy delicate or pulse.. buy Roger waters In the Flesh!!!
B00005OWEG|5.0|It was my intention to add another star to this. you know... 6 stars... that way this amazingly amazing movie could get its properness. If that fails to make sense, maybe you dont have the right kind of mind to watch this movie. Granted, EVERYONE has already seen it. prebirth human beings, not yet exposed to the horrors of the acid culture (definitely displayed in this movie) have seen this movie... or at least remember seeing it. Some weird genetic memory fellow that we cant shake off.<br />I fully enjoyed this movie, mostly due to the fact that this is something to watch over and over again while &quot;twisted on weird chemicals&quot;, as Thompson would put it.<br />'nuff said.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This movie combines the Ancient world with a story line that can relate to anyone.  It has drama and action that mix together to tell a compelling story about love, friendship, betrayal, and honor.  If you want a great DVD, but this now!
B00005BKZJ|5.0|Possibly one of my favorite films ever made, this story of a german housewife, that leaves her husband in the Mojave Desert, end up suprising me constantly. Why? <BR>The lead actress Marianne Sagebrecht performance as Jasmine is so full of poetry and subtle nuances in the body language that most actors often forget to use. Many times she is in a scene where she is not saying much but she doesn't have to because her lines are in the way she moves and the expressions on her face. The story is about a sleepy two building town where despair is turned on its heel by the arrival of this stranger. It's about two very different people who become friends despite the tragedys they both are facing and its about the magic we all carry inside of us to transform other around us by being our most beautiful selves. This film was followed by a television series that failed to capture what this story easily told in 90 minutes. It also has a very haunting song called &quot;calling you&quot; that once heard will more than likely stay in the back of your mind. Its a gem and definitely belongs in the collection of anyone who really loves what great film making is all about.
B000002LGQ|5.0|If youre just getting into Madonna, let the Like A Prayer album be your first choice. Like A Prayer was truly her breakthrough record, even though she already had over a dozen hits by 1989. The title track is my all time favorite madonna song, with its gospel, pop, and soul. The rest of the album is just as great. Songs like &quot;Cherish&quot; and &quot;Oh Father&quot; are some of the best Madonna has made. Most of the songs have a religious or family theme, such as &quot;Promise To Try&quot; and &quot;Keep It Together&quot;. Theres also an interesting skit called &quot;Act Of Contrition&quot;, dealing with the end of time. More fun than the dreadful studio followup &quot;Im Breathless&quot; and more thought provoking than the next &quot;Erotica&quot; album tried to be, Like A Prayer remains Madonna's crowning acheivement.
B00003CXXJ|4.0|this brings home a warm and fun fealing to those who veiw it.me and my whole family enjoyed this movie so much we had to watch it 4 times...this movie also shows the difference in being different at that its ok to be that way.I found it not only just a great and entertaining movie, but a great learning tool as well.
0385484518|5.0|An excellent style of writing, so simple in delivering a clear message that seems always forgotten by people. The time we need to take in order to reflect on what life is all about, be courageous enough to face what we don't believe in, and that there is no such thing as it is &quot;too late&quot; to change what we don't like in life....<br />The beauty of being simple in our daily feelings, and how we can create our own culture in approaching our daily matters. The power of giving to people, sharing with them and put our best effort in leaving always a good impression...<br />A great book to read and keep in your collection, very inspiring and the way it is written leaves no doubt of how life should be approached...
B00005QK3W|2.0|I read an article a few weeks ago in a publication, in it Paul had said he was planning on working on this (and was) in a similiar fashion as Revolver/Rubber Soul were created, meaning \\"fresh\\". This is anything but. There are 5 or 6 decent songs here, the rest are filler. He expiraments with some interesting techniques that oddly enough work quite well. The dark mood created on She's Given Up Talking is particularly rich and moving, unfortunately most of the album is sentimental rehashings that really say very little that wasn't said in previous efforts. I am most annoyed and dissappointed in the title song. Simply put Driving Rain is the worst song here. It's difficult for me to get my mind around how he felt this particular track had the strength of a title song, it's VERY weak. <BR>On the plus side, the production is very good. I like the back to basics stripped sound. Unfortuantely, the lyrics in particular are just generally uninteresting for the most part. And as much as it pains my patriotism, Freedom just has no hook and is not a good song. I like the first 3 songs, I like Heather, Spinning on an Axis, and Rinse the Raindrops and little else. (...) I love Paul and find a lot of his solo efforts (Flowers in the Dirt, a personnel fave) to be mixed, however, this one effort seems to be mostly mixed up. This cd could have been condensed considerably, that wouldn't help correct the lack of a true direction however it would have kept my finger off the \\"skip\\" button.
B000001FGG|5.0|All blues and rock guitarists, whether expert, beginners or just dreamers should put the live versions of &quot;Spoonful&quot; and &quot;Crossroads&quot; on their machines and play them to destruction. <br />I first heard these two live tracks over thirty years ago, and have never heard any live solo playing to come near them. &quot;Crossroads&quot; comes out of the blocks running and just never stops. If it were a horserace, it would win by ten lengths! Any other versions of this song by Clapton are not even 20% the quality and power of this live one.<br />&quot;Spoonful&quot; almost defies description, with its changes of pace, volume, tone, mood - it has the lot. Someone here called it a &quot;rail against the heavens&quot; and that's a good way of putting it. I know the solo now, note for note, and it still speaks with power and eloquence and emotion after all this time. Yes, that's the word - emotion. For me, this is the blues-rock equivalent of BB's &quot;Live at the Regal&quot;. I can't say any more than that.<br />Buy this and never put it down.
B00005OM4N|4.0|Okay, now that she's ending her second decade of life, Britney's decided to switch gears, and it pays off much better than we may have anticipated.  Yeah, this isn't as good as Carole King's &quot;Tapestry&quot; (probably not as good as Madonna's &quot;True Blue,&quot; either), but all in all, this works.//         On the surface, there are lots of signs that Britney Spears is trying to overhaul her image.  The lyrics on this CD address independence, dancing, and, puzzlingly enough, a modicum of feminism, which is kind of alarming coming from a performer with Britney's calculated coquette image.//         But there's lots of good stuff here.  It's harmless, but it's fun to listen to--the sonic equivalent to a frozen yogurt.  She eschews the ballads for the most part, which isn't a bad move.  Her contemporary, Christina Aguilera, can sing circles around her at slower tempos, so Spears sticks to uptempo tracks.  In that respect, this album seems to carry a fairly strong influence from NSync's &quot;No Strings Attached,&quot; packing on syncopated dance tunes, and only slowing down for &quot;I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman,&quot; which features a co-writing credit by Dido (it's rather surprising that a morose performer like Dido would contribute to a Britney Spears record, but I guess everyone's got to make a living).  For the record, &quot;I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman&quot; is a solid enough track, but probably not the bullseye-style statement Britney was aiming for.//         The opportunity cost for trying to make &quot;I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman&quot; into the centerpiece is the lack of a knockout single like &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot; or &quot;Oops! I Did It Again.&quot;  &quot;I'm A Slave 4 U&quot; comes close, but it doesn't really rise above the rest of the music on this CD as the standout track.  On the flipside of that, though, there are also no truly filler songs here, so the album is at least more consistent than her previous efforts.  Essentially, each of the tracks seems like it was thought out and produced with a specific goal--yeah, it sounds like an album of top ten singles.//         Perhaps the most solid criticism one could aim at an album like this is that it simply doesn't take any chances, musically.  Britney Spears, as a pop culture phenomenon, has taken some chances here with her image (yes, she sings about sex), but listening to this album from beginning to end, it's easy to find the inspiration in the megahits of the 1970s and 1980s.  Strip away the modern flourishes, and &quot;Anticipating&quot; sounds a lot like &quot;Never Gonna Give You Up&quot; by Rick Astley.  &quot;Bombastic Love&quot; is a twenty-first century ABBA song, basically.  And &quot;Boys&quot; sounds like a cross between Vanity 6's &quot;Nasty Girl&quot; and Janet Jackson's &quot;Nasty.&quot;  It's not bad--these are the kinds of songs that have been long absent from radio--but it's not really raising the bar, either.  But then again, Britney's also navigating some treacherous waters--she can't make the mistake of making music that sounds like she's trailing behind Christina, nor can she go down the roads already cleared by contemporaries like Jessica Simpson, 98 Degrees, or Mandy Moore.  And somehow, I don't think the public would buy into her taking a chance on a country album or a gangsta rap effort.  So she's left with the concept of forcing her own music to evolve, and while she does move forward, she seems somewhat at a loss as to where she goes from here.//         The remake of Joan Jett's &quot;I Love Rock 'N Roll&quot; is adequate, though it would be unfair to expect it to even approach the original.  In the Britney canon, it's better than her remake of Sonny And Cher's &quot;The Beat Goes On,&quot; but not quite as good as her assault on The Rolling Stones' &quot;Satisfaction.&quot;//         Perhaps the only song that really misses on this album is the final track, &quot;What It's Like To Be Me.&quot;  Many national publications have spilled quite a bit of ink about some of the other tracks on here, but surprisingly few have focused on this one.  This song was co-written by Justin Timberlake and he does contribute vocals, though this is not a duet--it's more like a Justin Timberlake cameo.  The subject matter of this song is basically an answer to Madonna's &quot;What It Feels Like For A Girl,&quot; which was Madonna's advice to the current crop of young female singers.  This is the song that should have been the centerpiece, but Britney did not contribute any lyrics with this one, as she did on several of the other tracks, and it suffers because of that.  At one point, &quot;What It's Like To Be Me&quot; lifts the breakdown from NSync's &quot;Pop&quot; completely and degenerates into what is simply an NSync song (suspiciously close to &quot;It's Gonna Be Me&quot;).  It's a great showcase for Justin Timberlake, who is apparently becoming a better and better writer, but it brings a fairly weak ending to what should have been Britney's declaration of independence.//         This is not a bad album--as a whole, it's probably better than her other two albums.  But this is not the home run she was aiming for.  While she has clearly left the ideas and sounds of her previous efforts behind her in an effort to evolve, Britney Spears probably finds herself at a crossroads now, with respect to which direction she should continue in.  It's to her credit that she's not re-recording her past hits under new titles, and it also shows her commitment to her own longevity that she's trying to carve out a new niche for herself.  But, somehow, this album feels like a stopping point on the way to the ultimate destination.
1559408898|5.0|This film was a huge hit when it was first released, and rightfully so; it was a perfect blend of gallows humour, violence, vision, and timeliness.<br />Peter Weller does a great job as Murphy/Robocop, particularly in the second half of the film, where he has to meld a human personality with that of a machine, which he has become.  Nancy Allen is negligible, and Kurtwood Smith (who's been equally good in so many character roles he's played over the years) makes a delightfully wicked 3 dimensional villain.<br />Ronny Cox would reprise his role as a 'head-honcho with a black heart' in Total Recall 3 years later, with similar success.  That film, also directed by Verhoeven, is just as good, and hasn't dated much in the years since its release.  Same goes for Robocop.<br />Excellent casting, superb production values, and great film pacing makes Robocop endlessly viewable.
B00000G3PA|2.0|I don't think anyone would have seen this movie if it wasn't for Bruce being in it.  Without Bruce, this movie would have been flat!  The story is silly, the acting is sillier.  The best part of this whole movie is Aerosmith playing in the background.  Just goes to show how a top notch actor and musical talent can change a dud movie into a hit!
B00003CXZ1|5.0|This a super good movie. Angelina Jolie makes a great Lara Croft.  The extensive plot captivates viewers of all ages.  The people claiming to think this movie is garbage must have had their eyes closed or saw a different movie because what I saw was pure exhileration, action, and of course pure Lara Croft(Angelina Jolie).  What else could you need in a movie.  This movie is not what all the critics think it is, for it is an awesome movie with a great actress and wondreful plot.  I'd be willing to pay double price if that were my only option to see it again.  If I were you, I'd go and see the movie if you haven't already and then you go and say what you think.  You could think I'm a blabbing idiot who doesn't know what he's talking about or you could agree with me that this movie needs to be reconsidered for an Academy Award.  This is a great movie and everyone should see it.
B00005OB0A|1.0|Why is the Locomotion girl still with us? It can't be her music. Is there something about this woman people find &quot;fascinating&quot;?<br />These days Kylie takes it easy. Gone are the days when she used to (at least) co-write her own material. On this album (Fever) Kylie lets Cathy Dennis &amp; friends do the songwriting and producing. But why? I can't understand why the ex-Impossible Princess can't handle simple dance lyrics like &quot;there's a dark secret in me... la la la... I just can't get you off my head&quot;. <br />This album has one extremely catchy song. The hit single Can't Get You Out Of My Head. There are at least 3 other songs that sound like &quot;Head&quot; and another 3 that sound like Cher rejects. Vocoders, Daft Punk-esque rhythms and lots of simple, disposable pop melodies. It's just too simple. Once you've listened to this album once there's no need to go back. It leaves you terrible unimpressed.<br />I have never heard anything so useless as &quot;More More More&quot;, &quot;Dancefloor&quot; or &quot;Come Into My World&quot;. These songs are just embarassing even for Kylie! <br />This will be her last album unless she changes quickly. I can't see any other song become a hit single from this album. Maybe Kylie should consider a career in soft-porn? At least she loves showing her bare arse everywhere (see the album cover).
B00005QK3W|3.0|I definately feel DRIVING RAIN is better than some of his later albums. While I find some of the lyrics rather hokey, I do like the looseness of the instrumentation and the gravel in Paul's vocals on many of the tracks. I'm very glad Capitol included &quot;Freedom&quot; at the end of the album.<br />It's not my favorite McCartney album, but it will probably grow on me. FLAMING PIE didn't impress me very much at first, but it has grown on me over time.
0871137380|5.0|I've read hundreds, and this is riveting. You feel the fear and anxiety as this story plays out. It is a story of error and confusion, but also of incredible bravery, sacrifice and brotherhood. I did not want the story to end, but for the sake of those who survived, I'm glad it did. I wish there was some way to personally thank all of those involved for the sacrifice they made in the name of our country. (whatever their original motivation for joining the armed forces)This is the American soldier at his best. I would highly recommend it!<br />Let's hope the movie does the truth justice.
B00004R99E|5.0|&quot;A Goofy Movie&quot; is one of my absolute favorite videos.  I've been marveling over this movie for years.  Everytime I watch this film, I can't stop myself from laughing.  The funny scenes never get old.  The story is about a young boy named Max, who is Goofy's only son.  Max throws a somewhat sort of concert at his school meeting and steams up the principal.  The prinipal calls up Goofy and completely exagerates Max's skit.  So then Goofy decides to take his unwilling son, who just finally got a date with the girl of his dreams, on a fishing trip crosscountry.  To make a long story short, everything that could poosibly go wrong does, and Max isn't quite getting along with his dad.  Goofy and Max eventually fall off of a huge waterfall before they finally realize that they really love each other.  But I'm not going to spoil the ending for you.  You'll just have to watch and find out, and I guarantee you that you won't regret it!
B00004Z459|5.0|This CD is the best,I listen to it practicly non-stop,it has songs like in the end,points of authority,forgotten,and my favotite runaway.All my friends have this CD and they say it's the best.You'll like it especially if you like cold hard rock like me.There also have some hip-hop in some of the songs.In most of the songs the lead singer,Chester Bennington,carries on an awsome chorus then the backround vocalist,Joseph Hann,takes on a sweet rap lead.They don't cuss but they sound just like the cussing groups like Staind and Papa Roach.I saw them at this years Ozfest and they were the best group I ever heard.They rocked the house from the mosh pit to wanna-be's outside.This CD is worth every penny and more.
B00005OM4N|3.0|well..after hearing this album, I was thinking, &quot;Hmm..what time is it?&quot;  the album was pretty much boring and I thought the music was pretty much the same; they were like her other albums/songs only this album has more cuss words (hmmm..like 3 or 4 in total), the repetitive use of the word &quot;sexy&quot; and &quot;baby&quot;, and less slow tunes.  Don't get me wrong, i thought some songs were great, but most of 'em were kinda bad.  The best song would have to be &quot;I'm a Slave 4 U&quot; or &quot;Anticipating&quot;.
B00005QIPH|5.0|Sure, the band has impeccable influences: VU, the Feelies, the Stooges, The Fall, Television, etc. But there are millions of bands out there who are influenced by those same post punk bands. So you can understand that I was pretty skeptical of all the hype surrounding the Strokes when I first heard about them. But I only had to listen to the CD once through to realize that I was wrong. This album deserves all the kudos it gets. While it's true that the band really isn't doing anything new, the overall quality of the album is so good that it hardly matters. The singer does the Lou Reed style talk-singing really well.  He even sounds like Mark E. Smith at times.  The guitarist's angular leads remind me of those crazy solos that Dave Davies played in the Kinks. All of the songs are catchy and memorable, and the band plays them with a loose, drunken swagger. Garage rock doesn't get much better than this....regardless of how many units it sells or whether or not they're on MTV. &quot;Is this It&quot; is worth purchasing, especially if you still enjoy listening to those old post punk records. <br />I've heard some snobs slam this album.  On the one hand, I think it's good that they have minds of their own.  But on the other hand, I find it sad that they've become so jaded, they can't recognize a great album when they hear it.
B000001ELP|1.0|I personally think this is a terrible album that should never have been made. No wonder Ace left. If you are looking for KISS music, THIS IS NOT IT!!!
B000002R48|5.0|i just got this album today and already listened it for 3 times haha! amazing album, you can feel the dream theater atmosphere and style even in thier first album which is amazing!!. dream theater is my favorite band and in my opinion has the best control over their music gear!. amazing band that will never stop suprising me!. i insisit for every rock-fan, metalhead or everyone who like supreme music to buy all of their albums. its just amazing how the music of dream theater makes me go in trance. no words to describe these talanted heads. <BR>A MUST!! BRILLIANT!!! *clapping*!

B00005QG9J|5.0|If you are looking for Make Yourself 2, you sure won't find it here! In fact, there's not a single song on the CD that sounds much like anything from Make Yourself. That said, it is a great new combination of styles that combine to produce one of the best albums of the year.<br />This is one of those records that takes a few listens to fully appreciate. On first listen, the following tracks jumped out as the highlights for me: &quot;Nice to Know You,&quot; &quot;Circles,&quot; &quot;Wish You Were Here,&quot; and &quot;Warning.&quot;<br />As I continued to listen to the disc, softer but melodic tracks like &quot;Just a Phase&quot; and &quot;Are You In&quot; became among my favorites, while &quot;Nice to Know You&quot; and the radio-tired &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; became less appealing.<br />So after about, say, ten listens, here are the tracks in order from my most to least favorite...<BR>1. &quot;Blood on the Ground&quot; -- great, powerful funk/rock<BR>2. &quot;Have You Ever&quot; -- fairly hard song, great melody<BR>3. &quot;Warning&quot; -- unique song with nice lyrics<BR>4. &quot;Under My Umbrella&quot; -- funky but great!<BR>5. &quot;Just a Phase&quot; -- grown on me a lot; melodic song with distinct sections<BR>6. &quot;Aqueous Transmission&quot; -- middle-eastern sounding song that would be better if it didn't drone on for nearly eight minutes<BR>7. &quot;Circles&quot; -- funky but not as good as the other hard songs<BR>8. &quot;Nice to Know You&quot; -- pretty good music, especially the pre-chorus<BR>9. &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; -- this single was just okay to start with, and the radio has worn it down even more<BR>10. &quot;Are You In?&quot; -- okay, but not what I want from Incubus<BR>11. &quot;Echo&quot; -- mushy song with a redundant melody<BR>12. &quot;11am&quot; -- my gosh this sounds a lot like &quot;Drive&quot;...<BR>13. &quot;Mexico&quot; -- you'll either love or hate this acoustic song, and I'm with the latter<br />With only about three tracks that I'd consider weak enough to skip when listening to this CD, it beats most of this year's albums, and certainly all of this year's non-rock records (BSB, Nsync, J.Lo).
B00005LOUS|4.0|In response to some comments I've seen about this movie. I would like to defend it, and tell everyone if they don't buy it- to at least rent it. It is a funny, family movie. In response to everyone that has put this movie, and others down because they didn't like the humor in it, or thought it wasn't good for children- have a little fun. There is nothing wrong with this movie. It's a movie, and if you raise your kids right one movie will not make a difference in their morals or values. Laugh! Have fun!
6305265488|5.0|This is a wonderful movie.  The premise may be clich&eacute;, but this is much, much more than just another &quot;Cinderella&quot; movie.  Its effects are really quite magical--it will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and it will totally immerse you in its spell.  If you are human, it will produce a lump in your throat that will remain there for hours.  Some people might call this a &quot;woman's&quot; movie, but I, as a man, will proclaim that it really touches my heart every time I watch it, and I freely admit that it does bring tears to my eyes.  I need not go into detail describing the plot--it is a somewhat modernized Cinderella story, replete with the evil stepmother, charming prince, and angelic, mistreated heroine.  Instead of a fairy godmother, there is Leonardo da Vinci--an unexpected but brilliant scripting decision, I feel.  There are no magic pumpkins turning into horses and carriages, but there is magic; it is the magic of true love.<br />The entire cast is superb, particularly Anjelica Huston as the evil stepmother, but all of them are overshadowed by Drew Barrymore.  Anyone who does not feel that Drew Barrymore is one of the greatest actresses of this and any other generation has obviously not seen this movie.  I love all of Drew's movies, but I really believe this movie represents her finest performance.  Even down to the most unimportant nuances of acting, she is simply brilliant.  She is equally convincing as a peasant in the field as she is a royal courtier among the nobility of France.  The emotion she is able to express to the audience is deep and amazingly real.  I really can't say enough about her performance here.<br />All I can do is encourage you to experience this movie.  I believe you will want to watch it more than once; it is just as fresh and moving the second and third time as it is the first.  Don't dismiss it as a &quot;sappy love story&quot; or think its 16th century setting will make it hard to relate to.  This is a story as old as time itself, really, and it is a story that will always be relevant to humankind.  It celebrates the power of true love and shows all of us that dreams can indeed come true.ld as time itself, really, and it is a story that will always be relevant to humankind.

B00005QIPH|5.0|The Strokes are going to save musics a$$ in the upcoming years. They are going to bring back the 70s NY rock. All they need is people to listen to them. This is the best album I have gotten either than my Kiss albums. The strokes have it all to save music. They have they laid-back vocals. They have the lyrics. They have the music. They have the musicians. They are the best band you will hear these days. If you are looking for an awesome new-aged rock album, buy Is This Is. Take my word for it.
B00005OM4N|1.0|I would like to say that it was a great CD, and I honestly do like Britney, but quite frankly she has changed her image too much - from the girl next door to the raunchy and (...) girl on the corner.  Her songs on this album sound identical from one another.  They have the same tunes, the same beats.  It was extremely disappointing to me.  I think the only good song is \\"Anticipating\\" and yet it isn't even that great.  I was sitting and wondering to myself why people even like her.. but then again, I guess it's true: Sex sells.
B00005QDW5|5.0|The First time i heard Pink Floyd was on a TV special that had the Wizard of Oz and the Dark Side of the Moon. I really liked the music and I went out and bought the CD. It was really great. I liked the sound and the way all the songs strung into each other. I decided to get the Wall, But it was 30 dollars and i really dont like to spend that much. o well. It was amazing. It showed me that the band had to be one of the best ever. I've heard alot of their songs and i like all of them. Echoes has most of the bands great hits and is great to listen to. I personally like the way that the songs arent in order. I also like the choices the band used. The only songs it could have used were Welcome To The Machine, Have a Cigar, and Brain Damage/Eclipse. I actually laughed when i heard the change from High Hopes to Bike because they are so different. I would recomend this cd to anyone who likes good music.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I went to see this film using a free pass, not expecting much. Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy and Cameron Diaz are nowhere near on my list of favorite actors but this film was.....GOOD! This movie is funny and entertaining from beginning to end. I especially liked the soundtrack.<BR>This DVD set is also full of nice extras, well worth the price.<BR>Buy it.
B000009ED0|5.0|The Kid is a GENIUS. His songs may have some explicit lyrics, but &quot;naughtiness&quot; aside, these songs are great. It's not really the music, as much as it is the lyrical content, but something about Kid Rock and &quot;Devil Without a Cause&quot; is so intriguing, I definitely recommend buying this cd. However, if you're opposed to foul language and topics such as interracial relationships and white trash, you may want to skip over this, and keep your money for something &quot;nicer.&quot; But personally, all my friends and I *love* the Kid. He's awesome! And Joe-C (RIP) is the BOMB! ;]
B00005QDW5|5.0|Echoes is probably one of the best compilations ever put together.  The material that Pink Floyd has produced throughout the years is captured with this set.  My personal favorite used to be Comfortably Numb, but with this CD, I wouldn't be able to narrow down my favorite song.  I hope they tour again so I can go see them live, but until then, Echoes is the next best thing!
B00005OM4N|5.0|This is by far the best pop album that has been released this year and possibly one of the best ever.  Each and every song on this album is a standout.  Normally, on a record, there are a few standout songs, but on this one, every single one does.  Each one brings something different to the album.  Britney's maturity as an artist definitely shows through on this album, as it has a more mature sound than her two previous albums.  While Britney doesn't abandon her pop roots, her sound is more grown up and the songs are more experimental and more diverse.  I highly recommend this album to anyone who enjoys good pop music.  It is the prime example of a successful pop album.
B00004CWO8|5.0|I was able to see swan lake in NYC on broadway and fell in love at once with it.  After i got back home i missed the magic i saw on stage. I was so glad to see that they had put it out on video and dvd.  I bought and now am able to atch it over and over and it only gets better with time
B000002JS6|5.0|AC/DC is legendary and this remastered collection of songs from the boys is AWESOME. The best songs featured on this album are &quot;Hells Bells,&quot; &quot;Back in Black,&quot; &quot;You Shook Me All Night Long,&quot; &quot;Have a Drink on Me,&quot; and &quot;Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution.&quot; <BR>This CD absolutely kicks :P I love it! This 41:31 long album is infectious and mind-blowing. You can't help but wanna &quot;Shake a Leg.&quot; It's so great.
6305041156|4.0|Ran is a beautiful, colorful film. Filled with action, battles, drama, intrigue, Kurosawa's adaptation of Shakespeare's King Lear takes a unique flavor with a serious undercurrent of Buddhism. The message of the film that God is watching as men destroy each other; that God mourns the cruelty is pushed home directly in the final scene as the image of Buddha lies fallen on the ground below one of the old ruler's victims.<br />Emotionally touching, it is a heavy, but enjoyable film.
6305807086|2.0|I have to admit I kind of wanted to like Being John Malkovich. It sounded nutty and fun, weird in a good way. But it isn't. <br />It does try. Lord how it tries. But it doesn't work. The humor is forced and self-conscious, too indulgently pleased with its own quirkiness. Don't be distracted by how kooky everything is -- pay attention to the jokes and the way they're delivered, think about them. They're not funny. Well, all right -- we'll be fair. They're RARELY funny. John Malkovich does have his moments, and Charlie Sheen was a nice touch. <br />The characters are annoying. I disliked them and I disliked the performances of the actors who played them. Malkovich was acceptible; Cusack, Diaz, and Keener all raked on the nerves. I sense that, to some extent, these characters were designed to be unlikable. If so, they were designed well. <br />Understandably not content with being a comedy (since it's not especially funny), Being John Malkovich gradually treads into darker and &quot;deeper&quot; territory. What is identity, really? Why are there so many people who'd like to be someone else? What would it be like if they could? Would it be addictive? How would it impact the life of the &quot;possessed&quot; subject? Etc.<br />Trouble is, since the movie wasn't half as charming as it hoped to be early on, since the characters were all so strangely pathetic and annoying, and since the whole style of the film is jerky, abrasive, and deliberately unpredictable, my interest in such philosophical questions was not particularly aroused. It was evident in any case that this was a movie I would not be drawing anything too exceptionally deep from. I used to imagine, and play, through games and scenarios much stranger and more philosophically complex than the premise behind Being John Malkovich -- as a little boy. <br />A movie can be strange and different and &quot;out there&quot; and still be a failure when all is said and done.
B000002G23|5.0|This compilation of the group's original recordings and live songs is inspiring and somewhat nostalgic. All of the popular songs are present, but it's the not so famous songs (i.e. &quot;The Bed's too big without you&quot;) that are included in the set that make this a collector's item. The recordings remind us of a more simple pop/rock time when synthesizers and 10 DJ's weren't necessary to produce a hit.
0767824571|1.0|There are many DVD players that have a problem with unwanted english subtitles appearing in this film. CTHE has taken the position that if you are willing to spend more money to send the defective DVD back to them, they will replace it &quot;sometime after Thanksgiving&quot;. Given the large number of DVD players that this title has problems with I think it is blot on their reputation that CTHE is still distrubuting these defective discs.<br />There is an extensive discussion at the official Monty Python website (Pythonline.com) about this problem on their bulletin board.
B00005R2M3|5.0|With her new album &quot;Laundry Service&quot;, colombian singer Shakira proves how talented, gifted and &quot;full of grace&quot; she is in any language.  Smart lyrics WRITTEN BY HER and a great blend of excellent music COMPOSED BY HER, that is what Shakira Mebarak has to offer in this CD.  You will find pop rock fusioned with different world rhythms like a tango in &quot;Objection&quot; and its spanish version &quot;Te Aviso, Te Anuncio&quot;, andean flutes in &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; and &quot;Suerte&quot; and even middle eastern sounds in &quot;Eyes Like Yours&quot;, a remake of &quot;Ojos As&quot;, a previous hit from Shakira that can be found in the albums &quot;Dnde Estn Los Ladrones?&quot; and &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;.  In this album you will also find GREAT classic ROCK songs such as &quot;Fool&quot;, &quot;Rules&quot;, &quot;Te Dejo Madrid&quot; and &quot;Poem To A Horse&quot; and powerful ballads like &quot;Underneath Your Clothes&quot;, &quot;The One&quot; and &quot;Que Me Quedes T&quot;, where this talented young lady displays her great vocal range.  And if you are a pop fan, you will find you dose in the song &quot;Ready For The Good Times&quot;.  Shakira has done it again.  Laundry Service is a musical masterpiece for every music listener, this is a MUST-HAVE.
B000001FLA|4.0|This is perhaps, depending on your point of view, the last worthwhile Malmsteen album. After this release, Malmsteen was plagued by personal problems, worst of them his terrible car crash who almost claimed his life. After TRILOGY, Malmsteen hired pop singer Joe Lynn Turner and released the  pop ODYSSEY, with totally AOR lyrical themes. Malmsteen went on to concentrate apparently only in his mind-numbing &quot;shredding&quot; technique, when vibe and emotion never more returned to his music. TRILOGY is already more pop oriented than his two previous releases, but still manages to have something special surrounding its songs.
B00005QCYC|5.0|I have the first two films on VHS and DVD, I bought this silver engraved boxed set from some guy online, it can hold all three of the DVD's. So when the third film comes out, I am getting the full-screen to complete my collection on the full-screen versions, and the boxed-set so I can have them all in Widescreen! I am soooooo excited!JP films rule!
B000002BMV|4.0|This is Journey's best, if you can call it to a band that was always totally radio friendly. The case is that Journey at least managed to sound convincing, in most part thanks to Steve Perry's passional singing and Neal Schon craftmanship in the guitar. ESCAPE is really well produced by Mike Stone and Keith Elson, the songs are shinning with life.
B0000029GA|5.0|this album is the definition of a classic. i dont think nas will ever be able to top this. this is definately one of the few cds that i can listen to track after track without skipping a song. my favorite song on there is it aint hard to tell. the beat is so amazing. all i gotta say is if u aint got this album BUY IT RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!!
B000009QPE|4.0|This album is marvellous. People keep talking about its sheer speed, it's brutal attack, but it has a lot more than just that: it has many time changes, intelligent riffs, tight trash metal, good aggressive singing by Araya. It's a real mark. The only reason I don't give it five stars is because I keep wondering and wondering what went through Jeff Hanneman's head when he wrote the horrible lyrics for ANGEL OF DEATH...THe song is not against holocaust, it seems he is just describing the atrocities, without judging them, and at points it seems it is even praising the atrocities !!!
B00005Q66T|4.0|Altnough there are many tracks missing from this album its still worth buying.  Favourites like Deeper and Deeper, Ray Of Light and Msuic are all here, along with tracks like Beautiful Stranger and Take A Bow.  This album shows how #Maonna has changed over the years to appeal to a wider audience and shows that she has managed to do it without compromising herself or her musical ability
6303471501|5.0|In 1979, an Australian film was released starring 23-year-old Mel Gibson. This movie he is a cop in the future. Only a few years ahead from the present point in time. It was a great hit and had two sequels follow it. Only difference about them was that they were during a post-apocalyptic period. But this one is the best one of all in the entire trilogy. It is a pretty normal movie with regular things happening most of the time. The action doesn't start until the end when Max Rockatanski seeks revenge on a nomad biker gang for the murder of his wife and infant son. Max starts out as a kind loving man. But once everything in his life falls apart and he loses the people who are most important to him, he no longer sees the need to care for the lives of others. The evil bikers led by the Toecutter all suffer painful and terrible deaths for what they had done to Max's family. He starts out as a regular man with a job who has a family and a best friend. But sometime in the movie, Jim Goose, his best friend, is murdered as well. Then Max decides to quit his job due to that one event. He just happens to lose everything he had. All you see of him in the end is Max driving a Canyonero and armed with a shotgun while wearing his police uniform. A courageous hero doing what he can to rid the scum of the area. This is the best movie to watch out of all three.
059035342X|5.0|Harry Potter and the Sorcerors stone is a very good book that all ages will enjoy. It has a good story line and plot. It is funny and scary at some points. People can also relate to what happens in it(in a way).The whole book is great and is hard to put down. I normaly hate reading but i read over 200 pages in one day! There is almost always something going on to keep it moving, with a surprise ending. If u love reading, or even if u don't, I would definetly recamend it!
B00005AACC|5.0|Tom Cruise stars as Ethan Hunt. IMF agent chosen to recover a stolen virus. It is a threat to Australia and must be destroyed immediately. Only way to do that is to find a cure for it. Agent Hunt goes on several missions trying to settle with this problem. The closest he comes to is when he breaks into a lab and manages to destroy all the viruses except one. His girlfriend, Nyah (played by Thandie Newton) infects herself with it just to keep it out of the hands of the bad guys. But Ethan still needs to find the cure for it within 20 hours and get it to her before it kills her dead. Fantastic Action Movie. Most definitely much better than M:I. Original movie was terrible.
B00005QK3W|1.0|Please understand that I am a very forgiving Paul McCartney fan. I forgive the sappy production of &quot;Once Upon A Long Ago&quot;. I forgive the nonsensical words-that-sound-good lyrics like &quot;Say you don't love him, my salamander.&quot; Hey, I really liked &quot;Wild Life.&quot; But even an unabashed apologist like myself has to draw the line somewhere. The new &quot;Driving Rain&quot; succeeds in making &quot;Pipes Of Peace&quot; (my previous personal choice for Worst McCartney Album) look like an artistic triumph. I never thought I'd ever say this, but McCartney's melodies on &quot;Driving Rain&quot; are as forgettable as his lyrics. Every song seems like a retread. Even the two tunes I sort of enjoyed, &quot;Heather&quot; and &quot;Riding Into Jhaipur&quot; seem like minor homages to Manheim Steamroller and George Harrison (though I can only imagine Hari's reaction to the ultra-lightweight lyric of &quot;Jhaipur&quot;).  The musicianship and production are terrific. The general sound seems quite &quot;alternative.&quot; But it's all for nothing with songs (and vocals) as weak as these. Please....someone FedEx Paul a copy of The Beatles' &quot;Revolver'.&quot; Someone send Declan MacManus over to Macca's house for an intervention. Someone please remind this talented songwriter that he is...a talented songwriter. &quot;Driving Rain&quot; is, at best, godawful.
B00000JGEH|5.0|Great Action Movie. Yes it is indeed. An awesome story about a soldier from the future being sent back in time on a mission to stop a mankilling machine. The cyborg is also sent back in time to kill the mother of a child who grows up to be the most courageous leader to ever live. Just so he won't be born and teach humans how to fight against the machines they are at war with. Yes, the hero of the story speaks of how in the near distant future a nuclear war happens and wipes everything that is seen today out for good. Decades later, the most terrible war in history occurs of humans fighting machines. The machine sent back in time to kill Sarah Connor, mother of John Connor, is almost indestructible and can not be beaten by an ordinary human being. The only person with the skill to dodge it's attacks and open fire upon it is Kyle Reese, the hero and soldier sent back in time to stop the evil T-800 from altering history. It comes out later in the story that Kyle Reese is John Connor's father. Yes, only he didn't live throughout the end. Reese was killed trying to blow up T-800 with a fuse. But that didn't completely destroy the machine. Sarah took him out by having him crushed with something closing down on him. She had finally learned to have the guts and courage Reese had spoken to her of. Arnold Schwarznegger makes a good villain in this movie. A really big guy going around trying to kill people. And a small man trying to stop him which helps explain him being so tough and almost impossible to beat. Arnold usually is a good guy. He plays the same character in the sequel and in that movie T-800 is the good guy sent back to protect instead of kill. I'm sure a lot of people thought there was going to be a sequel to this movie by the famous quote of Arnold himself- I'LL BE BACK!
B00005QK3W|1.0|Please understand that I am a very forgiving Paul McCartney fan. I forgive the sappy production of &quot;Once Upon A Long Ago&quot;. I forgive the nonsensical words-that-sound-good lyrics like &quot;Say you don't love him, my salamander.&quot; Hey, I really liked &quot;Wild Life.&quot; But even an unabashed apologist like myself has to draw the line somewhere. The new &quot;Driving Rain&quot; succeeds in making &quot;Pipes Of Peace&quot; (my previous personal choice for Worst McCartney Album) look like an artistic triumph. I never thought I'd ever say this, but McCartney's melodies on &quot;Driving Rain&quot; are as forgettable as his lyrics. Every song seems like a retread. Even the two tunes I sort of enjoyed, &quot;Heather&quot; and &quot;Riding Into Jhaipur&quot; seem like minor homages to Manheim Steamroller and George Harrison (though I can only imagine Hari's reaction to the ultra-lightweight lyric of &quot;Jhaipur&quot;).  The musicianship and production are terrific. The general sound seems quite &quot;alternative.&quot; But it's all for nothing with songs (and vocals) as weak as these. Please....someone FedEx Paul a copy of The Beatles' &quot;Revolver'.&quot; Someone send Declan MacManus over to Macca's house for an intervention. Someone please remind this talented songwriter that he is...a talented songwriter. &quot;Driving Rain&quot; is, at best, godawful.
B000056WTG|4.0|In the year 1981, a sequel to the 1979 film &quot;Mad Max&quot; was released in Australia and later in America. Mel Gibson returned in his role as Max Rockatanski. But this time more like an anti-hero and a post-nuclear hero rather than a future cop. This movie is quite different from the first. The story has changed a bit by making it during a post-apocalyptic time period as the result from a nuclear war in Australia. This movie seems like it is just an action movie. There is lots of action in it. Max still has the Canyonero he did at the end of &quot;Mad Max&quot; but loses it in this movie. This time he has a traveling companion which is a dog named Dog. He is killed later in the movie which is something Max loses as well. This story is during a time when gasoline is rare and almost impossible to find. Humanity has no hope and a compound of survivors is guarding the last tanker of fuel. Max does happen to become the key to helping the people sneak it out without the scum outside getting it. This is a great movie even though the first one is better. This one does have a big action conlict at the end. This sure is a strange idea for a sequel to the story of the first film though.
B00005QK3W|5.0|Well it's Johnnie from the \\"other side\\" applauding my old mate for putting all his talent together for an entire album, though he gets to throw four cuts out and take one off and put it out as a single for charity.    This gives us a boffo 11 cut master-piece.  I know Mac was keeping these tunes to himself, all these years, 'cause I chided him too much.  These are actually old unreleased Beatle songs from some of our best albums.  Now we all get to enjoy them as a CD.

B00005OM4N|5.0|(...) I LOVE this cd!  It's better than the last one (which was good too), and it's a really new sound for her and I think she is definitely an artist with staying power.  Many people say she can't sing, yada, yada, yada.  But, when I think of Britney, I think of Madonna and Janet Jackson.  They don't have the greatest voices either but they make awesome music and they're some of the best entertainers in the world.  Britney's not coming out saying she's the next Mariah Carey or Whitney Houston or anything like that.  She's totally different!  I hope she stays around for a long time 'cause she's a great artist and an AWESOME entertainer.  My favorite tracks off this cd are \\"I'm A Slave 4 U,\\" \\"Overprotected,\\" \\"Cinderella,\\" and \\"What It's Like to be Me.\\"  The last one she does with Justin Timberlake and it's AWESOME.  You can listen to this cd over and over again,and each time, you'll love it even more!!
1563890119|4.0|I can admit when I've been an idiot.<br />I had heard praise for Neil Gaiman's &quot;Sandman&quot; series for years, and avoided it out of an irrational resistance to following recommendations.  I was an idiot; I admit it.  Finally, in early October, I gave in and bought &quot;Preludes and Nocturnes.&quot;  Two days later, I bought two more &quot;Sandman&quot; volumes, and, over the next three weeks, all the others.  I would still be buying the rest of Gaiman's work, but I have no more money.<br />&quot;Preludes and Nocturnes&quot; introduces Dream, called Morpheus, who is both lord over and incarnation of dreams and stories.  This first volume contains eight issues or chapters; the first seven describe a quest and the eighth is an epilogue of sorts.  Dream is imprisoned at the beginning of the 20th century; he escapes in 1988 and must retrieve three powerful tools that were stolen from him.  The overall tone is quite dark and more influenced by horror than much of the later series.<br />&quot;Preludes and Nocturnes&quot; is undoubtedly the &quot;Sandman&quot; volume that fits least well with the others, but I wouldn't call it weak.  Gaiman's stories have a peculiar ability to take up space in my imagination; they have an almost physical presence and demand to be reread.<br />It is not surprising that this book is not the most accurate representation of the series.  After all, &quot;Sandman&quot; was written as serial fiction.  It's hard to find the heart of a story until part of it has been written, often with a lot of floundering for tone and style; in serial fiction, the writer has no chance to erase or edit that experimentation.<br />Think of &quot;Preludes and Nocturnes&quot; as Gaiman groping for the heart of his story.  He finds it near the end of the book, particularly in the epilogue, which has nothing to do with quests and battles but much to do with life.  However, the uncertain beginning chapters are well-written and powerful in their own right, and their events, though perhaps not their tone, are an integral part of the later series.r events, though perhaps not their tone, are an integral part of the later series.
B00003CXX8|1.0|I've seen a lot of movies in the theater this year, but this one was by far the worst.  I came expecting a thriller, but it was more like I was going to fall asleep. The trailer is totally misleading, it looks all suspenseful. It's stupid, boring and I couldn't wait to get out of it. My butt ached the whole time and I got up to get food or to the bathroom a million times, because I wasn't afraid to miss anything.
B00004T8RK|3.0|This isn't probably as good as Ten, Vitalogy, or Yield, yet there are songs here that are real cool. The lead single, &quot;Nothing As It Seems&quot; was very mediocre. That's not really as good as songs like &quot;Light Years&quot; (second single, enjoyable listen), &quot;Insignificance&quot; and others. This is their most experimential to me, though, since it ranges from melodic acoustic, effects on instruments, and is still enjoyable. There isn't too much filler, although there is still some. Worthy buy though. If you like Pearl Jam A LOT, you should like this. This is still better than Vs. and No Code IMO.
630575067X|2.0|But unfortunately, this film was not very involving.<br />George Lucas once said that special effects without a story can be a pretty boring thing.  I'd wish he take heath to his own statement.<br />While the movie does have some good effects, it's overuse of CGI was like watching a video game on a giant screen.  It really became tedious after a certain point.<br />I'm probably in the minority on this, but perhaps it was wise that Lucas NOT do these first three movies.  In \\"Star Wars\\"  we hear old Obi-Wan talk about the past.  All of us had our own images on how that past must have looked like.  Of course, all of that is now ruined.   We now have Jar Jar Binks and bad acting by Jake Lloyd to visualize!
B00005QXXO|5.0|Yes, this time REAL Radiohead recordings. Though short, I like it better than either Amnesiac or Kid A, and this gives live versions recorded at their hometown, Oxford, and it includes my favorites from both CDs, &quot;the National Anthem&quot; and &quot;I Might Be Wrong&quot;. The title track is even better live!! It's faster, but much more natural, less avant-garde. Also, &quot;True Love Waits&quot; is a great way to end an album, as each time an EP gets released from Radiohead, if it has a different-type track, they put it in the end to surprise you. There are even the ones that I don't really care for that I love on this album. Essential for all Radiohead fans!!!
6302969352|5.0|In one word - YES!   So many great things have been said about this movie, that I don't know if I could add anything new.  <br />The American remake &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; was great, as was Disney's unofficial remake &quot;A Bug's Life&quot;.  But nothing well ever top the original.<br />I feel sorry for those reviewers with short attention spans that were raised on MTV videos, who find this movie long and boring.  Yes, this film is lengthy, but too me, this story is so involving that I simply lose track of time!  The great movies do that!<br />This was Toho Studios one-two punch for 1954.  Their other big movie that came out that year was the original &quot;Godzilla&quot; which also starred the great Takashi Shimura. Shimura plays Kimbei, the head samurai in &quot;Seven Samurai&quot;.  This movie also introduced me to Japan's greatest actor, Toshiro Mifune who plays the drunken samurai wantabe, Kikuchiyo.   For those who want to watch Mifune at one of his finest, check out \\"Yojimbo\\".  Another Kurosawa classic!<br />Kurosawa, in my mind is probably the greatest director of all time!
6304258984|3.0|I happen to really like this 1996 Michael Bay directed action packed blockbuster. If you like that sort of thing, then you will be in action movie heaven. Nicolas Cage stars as a biochemist who works with a con(Sean Connery), who is the only person to escape Alcatraz, to help stop a psychotic war hero who is holding the island jail hostage. He plans on releasing poisonous gas on San Francisco. Ed Harris plays the mentally unstable war hero. He does is with steely excellence. Connery is his usually solid self in his role. Nicolas Cage is good as well. The action scenes are wild, loud, and as explosive as can be. There is also a nice touch of pretty funny comedy throughout the film as well. It's loud and obnoxious, and I love it. Michael Biehn, Tony Todd, Vanessa Marcil also star. This is one fun, wild ride. Take a trip to the rock.
B00003CXAA|4.0|Listen.. throw out poisoned cannoli's... Joey Zaza, put the first two movies in chronological order &amp; as good as the Stones with Mick Taylor. That's why it gets 4 insteadof 5.. Still as great as can be . Extra disc... Bussetta, looking for his name for 20 years.
0671027344|5.0|Dear Reader, who does not think that this book is it's 5 stars worth, and who is amused by Charlys histerial fits... I do not think you were able to understand the tragecy of this book. Read it another time, and you'll see, it'll touch you!
B00000AFWW|5.0|After getting more press than O.J. Simpson, Courtney Love and Hole went underground to put together this quality, guitar-driven rock/pop release. CELEBRITY SKIN is packed from beginning to end with up-tempo, hard rock gems that show Love's strength and direction as a songwriter. Co-writing several tracks on CELEBRITY SKIN is Smashing Pumpkins front man BillyCorgan (&quot;Malibu&quot;, &quot;Petals&quot;).<br />The title track is co-penned by Corgan with Love scripting the lyrics. Kicking into overdrive from the first chord, the song talks about the often-comical pursuit of fortune and fame. The lyrics on &quot;Hit So Hard&quot; make you wonder whether Love is talking about domestic abuse or the drop-dead feeling that results from spotting the most beautiful boy in the world across the room? The lyrics are smart enough to support both theories. Other tracks to check out are &quot;Awful,&quot; &quot;Reasons To Be Beautiful&quot; and &quot;Boys On The Radio.&quot;
0440224764|5.0|I've just read this book for the second time.  I read it when it first came out and told everyone I knew to read it.  I was bored and had nothing to read, so I read it again.  I read about 4 books a week, different authors, different story lines, this is by far the best book I've ever read.  If you've been in a cave and never read Grisham before, read this one. I can almost guarantee you'll love it. It's not only very fast paced, but it has an ending that will leave you thinking for weeks.
0064400557|5.0|This book can be used to cultivate a good reading habit as it is very appealing.
B00005JK93|5.0|Hedwig is distend to be a new cult classic. This film has it all,<BR>a story line that keeps you involved with great twists. And a knock out sound track. This is the new Rocky Horror Picture Show. The more times you see it, the more you see. Go see and sing along. A real rock opera!!
0553213105|5.0|This book is filled with memorable characters and beautifully written prose that deserve applause. I instantly liked it from the first paragraph. Certainly literature that demands a second reading.
B00005RYQO|5.0|This movie has it all.  Fast cars and HOT guys!!!!  What a great combination.  Paul Walker, Vin Diesel and Johnny Strong make this movie worth seeing again and again.  If you want the excitement of racing cars at high speed without being in the car this is your movie.  My heart was racing as I watched those guys burn some serious rubber.  Worth every penny!!!
B00003CXXJ|5.0|This movie is very well done. It's hysterically funny, the animation is wonderful and you don't get bored for a minute. I highly recommend it.
B00004Z459|3.0|I'm not a fan of the whole rap/rock &quot;Nu-Metal&quot; genre, and on principle I had to give this 3/5 stars.  I can't wait until this genre goes away. <br />However, as much as I really wanted to write this CD off, a few of the melodies completely took me by surprise.  You'd have to be tone deaf to not appreciate that about &quot;In the End&quot;.  Another reviewer said &quot;I don't like it because it's too soft&quot;.  Sure, but... did you not hear that melody?!
6305633177|5.0|The video quality is (...) in most places, but this is still a must-buy for any METALLICA fan.  The \\"Day on the Green\\" performance of For Whom The Bell Tolls is great.  It's also nice to see what METALLICA was like in the early days.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|This CD may not have all the songs on it (since it is only on one compact disc) but it (obviously) has all the #1 songs on it from their first to Love Me Do to their last (together) The Long and Winding Road. It also comes with a helpful guide that tells about the songs and shows the covers of the records came with. It is sort of Beatles 101. Even though it doesn't have all the songs on it, it is a definite must for all Beatles fans from the U.S. to the U.K. to wherever.
B00004XONN|5.0|DARK SIDE OF THE MOON for the new millenium.  This one will be remembered twenty years from now.
0790736918|5.0|For anyone who is a fan of John Wayne (big or little) this is a must. This movie puts him in his classic role, a big, tough American cowboy and is he good at it. This is the most complex character Wayne had ever played. The scenery is the best. Filmed in Monument Valley, it has great Indian scenes, beautiful backgrounds, and a realistic plot. But it isn't just Wayne, the supporting cast from the Jorgensens to the Edwards, they're all great. Ward Bond is great as a Rev. and as a Capt. of the Texas Rangers and just as Sam Clayton. Look for John Wayne's son! Patrick (Pat) Wayne is a young Lt. who is always getting in the way. His character adds comedy to a great dramatic film, which usually means disaster, but here it is almost impossible to look at it without it. John Ford directed it. The movie is a classic Wayne-Ford film. Those are always great. The last scene in which John Wayne is walking away from the door is a tribute to Harry Carey. His son, Harry Carey, Jr., is also in the movie as Brad Jorgensen. After seeing this movie, you will wish they would put it back on the big screen like it was in 1956. Overall, it is one of the best John Wayne movies and that means one of the best all time.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I challenge anybody to find a more complex, beautiful, groundbreaking album.
0140288503|5.0|Being a military enthusiast I thoroughly enjoyed this book from cover to cover, I especially enjoyed how Bowden included the reactions and perspectives of the Somalis.  This book is definitely a &quot;must have&quot; for anyone that has interest in the Military and more specifically Special Forces.
0156012197|3.0|The story's pretty good, but it might be a little too deep or somewhat boring for the average young child.  The messages the book sends are rather opaque, which may be why adults like it so much.  I know a lot of adults like &quot;The Little Prince&quot;, but I have yet to hear a preteen say they liked it all that much - most of them, I think, find it boring.
B00003CX5P|2.0|Please Mr. Lucas, please re-release this movie. Take into thought what the fans are saying. That's why Star Wars is as big, the fans. I've been a fan since the 80's and I collect Star Wars. I love the originals (ANH, ESB, ROTJ) and watched them regularly, I couldn't get sick of them. Then when I heard that there was going to be prequals, I was so excited. I can't believe that is the result. It's more of a joke to Star Wars than a part of the Star Wars Trilogy. Just cut some of the podrace, take out &quot;Wizards&quot; and &quot;Yipeee&quot; and Anakin's accidental blow up of the Droid Control Ship. The future Darth Vader couldn't do it on purpose. He's so strong with the force. And please take out Jar Jar's stupid antics and dumb jokes and sayings. &quot;Ex-squeeze me&quot; It would be a much better film and I think the fans would love it more. It would seem more like Star Wars.
B00003CXQY|2.0|The movie itself is fine, but the additional DVD is pretty worthless.  First, it takes forever to load on the DVD player, and the material itself is really rather boring.  The documentary they made concerning the development of the movie is awfully boring and of low quality.  I regret having wasted the addition few bucks buying a &quot;Special Edition&quot; that isn't in fact all that special.
B00003CXCQ|4.0|This movie is a classic! So fantastic! I had problems getting the second disc--the features--to work, but it may be my DVD player. It looks great!
0451196716|4.0|I first read this book as a young child and recently re-read it, as it had managed to stick with me for many years.  I find the book to be interesting because it compels me to want to know what is going to happen next, or perhaps better said &quot;who&quot; is going next.   King paints the suggestion that this is the future of telelvision game shows, and considering the recent revival of &quot;reality tv&quot; I'm wondering if he's not that far off.  I give 4 stars, because I never feel that King fleshes out his characters enough for me, however, there is enough waiting and wondering for the reader, in this book, to make up for it.
B00005QK3W|5.0|Driving Rain ranks with any solo McCartney, let alone solo Beatle outing. Its a good raw rock n' roll record. At first youre expecting Flaming Pie chapter two but you don't get it. Not to be disapointed, this is something new. There more of the aftertaste of Run Devil Run on this record. Its raw and it rocks and it touches you. Macca has not put out a record like this yet. Its unlike his early albums because it sounds studio (McCartney, Ram and Wild Life, sounded almost primitive and home demoee), this record sounds produced, but not over produced like Flowers in the Dirt and Off the Ground. It has a lot of energy and emotion in it. From a Lover to a Friend almost makes you cry when you realize what Paul is saying in that song. Lonely Road has a great groove and pocket you can live in. Your way is a good toe tapper country song, sounds almost like it should have been on Tom Petty's Wild Flowers. Your Loving Flame is a another classic Macca ballad. Tiny Bubble has good soul to it. Driving Rain is a power pop tune that is relentless and its hard to get it out of your head. Rinse the Rain Drops allow long and played out never the less rocks. Riding into Jaipur is kind of interesting, very George Harrison. About You is open guts rock and is the rawest track on the record. It reminds me of Get Back sessions on the rooftop. I Do is typical Paul. The weakest songs on the album in my opinion are Spinning on Axis, Heather and Back in the Sunshine but they even grow on you after a couple listens. The more you listen to the record the more you like it and the more you forget about Flaming Pie. The best song on the record is She's given up talking, that song is great, nuff said. I believe this album is one Paul's best and I think it will endure to a lot of listeners. It seems to be selling rather well too. Its truley something new and fresh, if you're a macca fan be sure to know that going in but you will love it after three listens. Buy it!! Its Great I promise!! New listenerstake a chance on PAul's new record, you will like it.
0553062182|3.0|Aron indicates that all many ESP children yearned for were adults in their lives that were kind and would protect them.  Kind adults, in Arden`s opinion, did what they could to minimize environmental stimulation, while cruel adults allowed children become overstimulated.  Neglectful adults were also terrifying, since linear thinking children who were ignored could not trust the availability of consistent protection.  As adults, ESPs provided their children with calm quiet living spaces, consistent routines, and simple toys.  So as to further exclude extraneous sensory input, instructions were presented in step-by-step format, and concepts were often divided further into smaller and even more distinct categories. <br />Elaine Aron indicates that others saw her as shy, timid, frail, well-behaved, fearful, and uninterested in everyday events, while she saw herself as full of passion, insightfulness and imagination.  She paints a picture of a world where her need for lowered stimulation were often either ignored, mislabeled as a lack of confidence, or seen as silly and irrational.  Among ADHDers, however, ESPs are often portrayed as  irritable maliciously nitpicking adults who exhibited strong corpse-like tendencies and who liked to suck the life out of every situation.  The child who saw herself often as overwhelmed and out of control has become, in the eyes of many ADHDers, very rigid, controlling, and condescending. <BR>  <BR>The hallmarks of the ADHD children are their enthusiasm, inquisitiveness, curiosity and boundless energy.  Their hyperactivity is often cognitive, as well as motoric, as they are constantly shifting tasks and perspectives, continuously seeking that which is new and different.  They know that the teacher does not like them, she considers them disruptive and uncooperative, she always seems to get angry over little things, and seems to take every little movement and utterance as a personal threat.  They do not know, however, that the teacher sees them as cold, unfeeling, aggressive and even abusive.  These are the children who always seem to ruin things for others by not being on time, or still or quiet - they seem to always ruin things for others like her.<br />The ESP teacher is often surprised at how ungrateful and unappreciative her ADHD students are of her efforts to maintain tranquillity in the classroom and how inconsiderate these same students are in their incessant introduction of chaos and points of irrelevancy into lesson plans.  These little monsters seem bent on breaking apart those safe, discrete little fortresses of knowledge she built for them.  Contrarily, these students find her classroom a barren desolate and restrictive place where nothing one does can ever be good enough, where nothing is to be questioned, where precision is paramount, and breathing itself seems almost frowned upon.  The experience is very frustrating and often frightening.  Sometimes it just seems less painful to stop caring or too easy to become angry.<br />The ESP teacher considered the world in it`s entirety as being too frightening and chaotic for her students, so she carefully partitions the world into neat little categories where all but a slim solid sliver is carefully excluded.  Critical thinking means staying on topic, but going into greater detail.  Those who are not detail oriented lack depth and foresight.  For these students, however, knowledge is too isolated, too fragmented.  Sometimes the lesson does not quite makes sense because too much is left unexplained, unaccounted for, left out.   These students crave the same sense of kaleidoscope of wholeness, that would cause their teacher`s solid and structured certainty to disintegrate and collapse.
0316777722|3.0|This book is a collection of essays regarding the life of David Sedaris.  Some are hilarious, others are more mundane, and some just leave you wondering why they're included in the book.  All of them, however, contain a slightly slanted viewpoint about everyday occurences in the life of the author.  I enjoyed most of the essays, but some include some rather crude language.<br />This book was great for my busy schedule.  I could pick it up and read an essay or two, put it down for a few days, and then pick it up again without losing any continuity.  Great reading for relaxation and enjoyment.
B00005JKOV|5.0|Be forwarned that this is not a conventional film or even a conventional animated film.  The film has no plot and no climax. <BR>This film takes the viewer into the dreams of a man in his twenties who is a deep philosophical thinker.  The viewer gets the sense that he is floating around the place eavesdropping on conversations.  Most of the main character's dreams involve dialogues of a philosophical nature which at times becomes rather abstruse.  I found a few conversations very difficult to follow.  I did get the gist of what most of the characters were saying however.  Some of the characters sounded like PhDs in philosophy and literature and some sounded like everyday people discussing profound ideas but were making their points in awkward roundabout ways.  Regardless of what the characters were talking about or doing they all seemed like real people who were passionate about what they were saying and or doing.  (...) <br />Only a specialist in metaphysics or someone who is well read in profound philosophical ideas will be able to follow all of the dialogue in this film after the first time watching it.  I thoroughly enjoyed this film, but most people in my opinion will hate it as most people do not talk like the characters in the film.  The redeeming value of a film like this is that it exercises your brain and forces you to stop and listen to what others say about non-worldly matters.
B00005B4GU|5.0|I have all five of Radiohead's albums and i must say that Amnesiac is my favorite. I know not many Radiohead fans like it, but still. This album, when i first heard it, was completely different from every Radiohead record i've heard, and what i mean by that is the lyrics and the melody of the album. Amnesiac gives you this haunting chill on you where as OK Computer and Kid A won't. Pyramid Song is very haunting and gloomy and one of my favorite songs on the album. I really love You and Whose Army?, which is another fav of mine on this album. <BR>   Amnesiac is my favorite Radiohead album and that doesn't mean i hate all the other albums. They're all great.

0385505833|5.0|I give this 5 stars. Not because it's a Grisham masterpiece. It's so shallow. I flew threw it in a few hours. If you enjoy inspirational stories presented in a framework along the lines of &quot;It's A Wonderful Life&quot; or &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, but not shallow like &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot;, I recommend that you also read &quot;West Point&quot; by Norman Thomas Remick. I say &quot;also&quot; because Grisham is always worth reading -- even if he tries to forget about this one after he deposits all that money in the bank thanks to those who buy anything at Christmas. Meanwhile, I myself give &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; 5 stars because of how clever Grisham is. His motive for the book is the exact antithesis of the storyline. He cleverly recognized the irony of it all. Do you?
B00001ZULV|3.0|The work of Genesis remains as strong as the remaining trio. Turn It On Again: The Hits, spans the groups creativity of Phil Collins,Tony Banks, and Mike Rutherford. Although it contains their highpoints, on songs like Invisible Touch, That's All, and No Son Of Mine, it fails to connect as widely, or as commercially into the days when Peter Gabriel and Steve Hackett were members of the cast.<br />Although Phil Collins left Genesis in 1996, the trios edge still endures on the radio. It will always remain fresh on people, just as the songs Phil Collins did as a solo artist.
0066620694|5.0|In a short (270 pages) text, Professor Christensen provides us with a lucid explanation of the hazards of conventional thinking when faced with developing markets for goods or services.  Christensen points out that unthinking compliance with the managerial practices that allowed success in established markets can often lead to ruin in emerging markets.  New realities create new truths.  His is a cogent argument for thinking and acting &quot;outside of the box,&quot; at appropriate times and under appropriate conditions, to create the conditions that breed success in new circumstances.  In a constantly evolving world, leaders in all markets will want to read this book to open their minds to new possibilities, and broaden their horizons.
6305718954|5.0|I got interested in this movie in the first place because they filmed the opening scenes (Belo Quinto) here in Mexico, close to where I live and I got to see the production team working there, so I was curious about the movie they were making. That was what made me go to see the movie in the first place.<br />But when I saw the movie I thought it was REALLY good, better than expected actually. I know it was attacked by some Catholics in some places, but I -as a Catholic- found it very interesting, something to think about it, really. One of my teachers in college is an Italian priest, a teologist actually and he recommended us to go and watch the movie, he thought it was very insightful and very good material for a debate. So, under his point of view I liked it even more.<br />The DVD is wonderful, specially with the comments from the director, which is a very interesting way to understand the movie and its symbols a lot better. I wouldn't say this is a horror movie, I wouldn't compare it to the Exorcist or to any other movie. This is special on its own. The performances from the actors are great and very believable and the locations give a very special feeling to the whole movie. <br />I highly recommend this movie to people who wants to see an intelligent movie with a deep theme and that -most definitelly- will make you think a lot afterwards.
B00005OM4N|5.0|This is some of Britney's best work.  Her older fans will appreciate the maturity of her voice as well as her style.  I love every song on this cd...way to go Brit!
B00005LQ6S|1.0|I missed the movie in the theater and when it was released only on DVD, I just went ahead and bought it on video.  What a mistake!!  Although it did bring together the original character with the series characters, I was not impressed.  Actually it was awful.  To have Connor admit defeat and Duncan accepts that is ridiculous.  Thank goodness it was the end.  I will just enjoy the first movie and forget about the botched attempts to follow that up.
B00005OM4N|5.0|This is some of Britney's best work to date!  Her more mature fans will appreciate her new style.  Those who didn't like it were probably too young to appreciate it.  Good Lord, like the girl says, &quot;did you ever think it'd be ok for me to step into this world&quot;!  Way to go Brit...keep em coming!
B000006NPY|5.0|ok, so you dont like techno or electronica at all. i don't like most of it, but thats cause most of it is meaningless. but even if you dont like techno there is still a lot to like on here. There are even beautiful acoustic ballads that make this good listening w/ girlfriend or boyfriend! Here are (SOME) of my favourite tracks, but then again they all are. I can only conquer laziness so much...<br />To Sheila - Beautiful in every sense of the word 10/10<BR>Ava Adore - Catchy electronica with great lyrics 9/10<BR>Tear - This belonged on the MACHINA album cause it fits in perfectly with the story, this one being June's death. 10/10<BR>Dusty &amp; Pistol Pete - Creepy. ABout Pistol Pete, who has killed his lover, but her ghost doesnt know that shes dead. 9/10<BR>Annie-Dog - The archetype of a junkie and a whore (June from MACHINA?) 10/10<BR>For Martha - A fitting eulogy for Billy's mother 10/10<BR>Blank Page - I want this to be played at my funeral. 10/10<BR>17 - A 17-second piano part from Blissed and Gone (on the limited edition disc that comes w/ the greatest hits). You hafta read the poem that accompanies it to understand. 8/10<br />All in all, well worth the price (even though i got it pretty cheap). I can't believe that I found this in the used bin.
B00005OM4N|5.0|I have to say, I think this is one of the greatest CD's I have bought in a while. I will admit, I have Britney's other two albums, and enjyed them. But this one is different. This shows true artistic growth, and dispite what her obstinate haters will say, this album has a strong message, but doesn't lack a little that feel-good fun music that made Britney famous. Now here is another newsflash: YOU might even LIKE this album. Of course I am not talking to her hard-core fans because they already hate the CD, but rather to the people who are a little reluctant to buy a Britney CD (there is somewhat of a stigma attached to it). But the truth is that most critics have had great things to say about this &quot;transitional album.&quot; The Amazon review aint bad at all, and neither is the Billboard review. I am sure there are plenty of not-so-good reviews people will attack me with, but I still think that this album is incredible from start to finish. For all of her fans who like the &quot;old Britney&quot; then there are a few tracks reminiscent of her earlier pop days (Cinderella and the irresistable Bombastic Love). For those who want more of a rock edge there is my favorite track, Lonely, and What it's Like to Be Me, and I Love Rock'n'Roll. And for those who want more of a hip-hop style, Boys is an awesome track that has grown on me, and I'm a Slave for You is another good club track. Other than that there is a great un-sappy ballad (Not a Girl) a disco-reminiscent track (Anticipating) and a great track called Let me Be that doesn't really fit any catagory but I love it. Anyway, I strongly recomend this album, not soloely based on its dancability, but its artistic merit.
B00003CX5A|4.0|...usually I HATE it when a classic story is &quot;updated&quot;, but I've got to admit that I really enjoyed &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; with Johnny Depp. Rather than the self-absorbed schoolteacher in the original, this Ichabod Crane is a police inspector come from New York City to investigate a rash of decapitations in the hamlet of Sleepy Hollow. Depp's Crane is a proponent of forensic science, and is trying out all kinds of gadgetry while attempting to solve this grisly mystery. And did I forget to mention that this is a comedy? Black humor, to be sure, but I really enjoyed this version of Washington Irving's horror story.
B00005JKHP|4.0|The content of the DVD is (by current standards) average. When compared to \\"Fully Loaded\\" DVDs, it ranks in the lower of the top 20 DVDs of all time and will very likely fall soon.<br />Multiple trailers and commentaries have become standard by now but the documentaries are very good insights into the TREK phenomenon that did not happen -  \\"Star Trek: Phase II\\"  - which was to pick up shortly after the original series left off with the same cast (minus one VERY important member of whom you must see the DVD to find out). The information, while appealing to Trekkies/Trekkers, seems lacking, and very very somber.<br />The movie itself is in great shape. Until you see the Documentary on how they changed the F/X shots, you hardly notice the difference.<br />The film itself is not the problem. It is the point in the story where a VERY IMPORTANT PIVOTAL MOMENT occurs: Spock discovers the KEY to the rest of the story. I have a problem with the moment that is obviously (after seeing the Documentaries) caused by editing and lack of time, especially the deadlines in the production schedule.<br />I am talking about when the Enterprise is approaching the \\"V-ger Cloud\\" and has been attacked once. Spock discovers that V-ger HAS been communicating but at a high-speed frequency. Suddenly, there is a cut as if they clipped a scene and there is an unexplained gap. One moment, there is a \\"calm after the storm\\" feeling, then instantaneously Kirk is looking a different way in the same shot and there is another \\"torpedo\\" (for lack of the actual term) speeding toward the Enterprise. This is a very IMPORTANT moment of discovery and suddenly, we are missing a moment in the story and the tenseness and thrill of the moment is lost. A missing transition, though it may be, it is crucial to achieve the proper mood and throws off the next ten minutes of the story.<br />Overall the DVD is a good movie and presentation. But for having TWO discs, there is merely average content. UNLESS anyone comes across some really good easter-eggs. (...)cross some really good easter-eggs. (...)
B00003CXXI|4.0|It's pretty hard to swallow a message about the meaning of true beauty when it comes from Hollywood types, but the cherry on top for me was that the &quot;ugly&quot; princess was also chubbier than the &quot;beautiful&quot; princess. AND the donkey, upon first seeing her, makes a joke about whether the ugly/fat princess has eaten the beautiful/thin one. Whatever beauty myths this movie was trying to explore, this was a blind spot.
B00005NWM3|5.0|Well, Nickelback has done it again.  With a great combination of the slide guitar and bass, they have outdone themselves and elevated their status as true original rockers.  Great solo in &quot;Money bought&quot;.  As a previous review stated, this band has easily distinguished themselves from so many others copycats who &quot;clog our airways&quot;.
B00005NZBN|5.0|Nothings worth much, not for long anyway. Especially reputations. With &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot; and &quot;Love and Theft&quot; Bob has yet again come up with a career altering course. Its been a winning hand for Bob most of the way but not all of the way and now he's on such a streak again that he can make even losing sound good. These songs sound like conversations had with riverboat gamblers and gutter snipes and cheats but Bob has always identified with the outsider and saying outlaw is just another way of saying that. If you didn't know him by reputation you would guess by the sound of his last two records that he is just another little known or listened to front porch or back hall songsmith. But then  you start listening and you start hearing just how tricky these tales are and they could not be told by a lesser teller of tricky tales. Bob's subtle anti-established standards music and their understated humble delivery just makes perfect sense in a Dylan kind of way. He never likes to do what you want him to but we always like what he ends up doing. These last two albums are hopefully just the beginning of another long run. No point in talking about each track, you know they're good.

B0000256KE|5.0|Roxy 2(the pleasure disc) possesses two mesmerising hits! Do the Strand is the perfect opener &amp; Editions of You with its cool Doors organ parody is the coolest hit and must have been a live one to see performed, these two provide the hooks to bring you in. And when there you get their best song about architecture In Every Dream Home A Heartache(&quot;....but what to do there....&quot;) . Plus the harmonica laden jam Grey Lagoons. All of that and The Bogus Man, an artful and eerie jam(Banshee fans will dig it). Lurking in the background behind Ferry's luxurious voice was the peacock feathered Eno who made a new kind of art out of background music. Ferry resented that the background was beginning to overshadow his foreground so this was their last record together. Eno has made a career out of the study of background music and Ferry has made it his life study to be Bryan Ferry, the biggest lounge act ever. Together something alchemical occured though for two grand albums. How much of it was intentional and thought out and how much just happened that way is not so important as how good it sounded and still sounds. The ear knows more than the mind does sometimes and my ears perk up alertly paying mind when it plays. Easily Roxy's finest. And you needn't go any further with this band unless you like cool disco, and smoky oboe and sax grooves and slick guitar jams.....I do, on occasion. Actually a great one to follow For Your Pleasure with is the live Viva.
B00005R2M3|4.0|My take on this album is just as mixed as everyone else. True, her vocals in English sound totally pinched and strained compared to her Spanish tracks - yes, &quot;Underneath Your Clothes&quot; is so sappy it's almost embarrassing, and the literal translation of &quot;Eyes Like Yours&quot; sounded like very bad karaoke compared to the original &quot;Ojos Asi.&quot; Missteps aside, though, I actually enjoyed this album a lot. Besides &quot;Objection&quot; and &quot;Wherever Whenever&quot; (and their respective Spanish versions), I also liked &quot;Fool&quot; and &quot;Poem To A Horse&quot; - musically and linguistically, these are the two best tracks she's done in English. The reason why I'm giving this a very generous four-star rating is because I still give her points for experimenting with genres - Latin and Middle Eastern, rock and pop, and (in the case of &quot;Objection&quot;) mariachi and ska. Personally, I've always thought that musically, she's closer in spirit to someone like Nikka Costa or Nelly Furtado, who could totally rock out, play with genres, preach, and be sexy at the same time - as opposed to an Alanis, Shania, or even Britney. My suggestion for the next album, besides better English and more Espanol, would be for some quality collaborators. Something along the line of, say, the Neptunes or Missy Elliott - because, hey, why not?
B00005KHJR|1.0|Leonard Maltin is crazy. I'm watching this movie right now and it's an immature, silly, and not at all frightening piece of goo.<br />A very lame movie.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|Thriller:The special edition (remastered) is a heaven-sent gift to all true music lovers. I won't even go into how great it is for Michael Jackson fans...! I'm sure they (you) know what it means to them. As well as the original songs featured on the album, Michael &amp; Bruce Swedien bless us with never-before released material, as well as rare interviews about Thriller and the magic that went into its making. The sound quality is superior, which is a plus - and apart from the jewels like &quot;Billie Jean&quot; and &quot;Human Nature&quot;, etc; this album also features gems like &quot;Someone In The Dark&quot; (recorded for the E.T. storybook back in '82) &amp; &quot;Carousel&quot; (a Thriller outtake). With these two extra tracks, Thriller is all the more a SUPERB album, in every sense of the word. One almost wonders why they were never included in the first place! You are also treated to a clip of Michael's original demo for &quot;Billie Jean&quot;, as well as Vincent Price's voice overdub on the RAP-part in Thriller (SPOOKY!)Anyhow, Thriller: The special edition (remastered) is simply a MUST. A heaven-sent gift from a true musical genius! Props to Quincy Jones' stunning production as well. The whole team had a magic and a power that is evident when you listen to the album. So without further ado (and there's not much one can say really!), buy this album, and experience true bliss.....you won't regret it.
B00005OAJ1|3.0|This is a funny album, full of laffs galore. It will appeal to listeners who haven't heard of Ween, and so think that the sounds they are hearing are brand new. <br />This is Ween's stumpy, famous younger brother. The idea of taking rock ballads and '70's concept rock and making it funny has been done by Ween for decades now.<br />Nevertheless. Good for a laff or two.
B00005NIL9|5.0|The sound quality after remastering is excellent! The cd version on A&amp;M was sounding a bit under par. And the bonus tracks of Oh I wept, The 2 of Fire and Water and the 3 of All Fight Now make for an interesting and excellent listen!
6300274195|5.0|It is the shortest film, and cheapest made, by Disney; and yet, &quot;Dumbo&quot;, released in 1941, was then, and remains now, among the best of the best to come out of Walt Disney.  It was made for under one million dollars, and with very little of the film  to reshoot, it did not take long to produce.<br />Dumbo is the proud baby elephant of Mrs. Jumbo, a circus elephant.  He is given the name Jumbo Jr., but later, as a cruel joke, by the other elephants in the circus, acquires the name Dumbo.  By the end of the film, he wears this name with pride.  Before then, however, the name of Dumbo haunts him, and causes him no end of grief and trouble.<br />The cause for Dumbo's misfortune becomes clear when he sneezes, the force of which causes his ears to pop open.  Immediately we see these ears are abnormally large.  As the other elephants start to laugh, Mrs. Jumbo shelters her baby in her arms.  When some children pass by Dumbo and begin making thoughtless remarks about his ears, and begin to tug on them, quite violently, Mrs. Jumbo's anger errupts.  She assults one of the children.  The circus people rush to the scene and quickly remove her.  She is placed in a cage, seperated from Dumbo.  Alone, and scared, Dumbo befriends an unlikely character - a mouse named Timothy.<br />When the circus people discover how large Dumbo's ears are, they decide to make him into a clown.  They drink to their success, during which a bottle of champaign is knocked into a water bucket.  This is unknown to Dumbo and Timothy when they drink from the bucket.  Dumbo suffers a bizarre nightmare, and awakes to find himself, and Timothy, high atop a tree.<br />In trying to figure out how they got up there, Timothy strikes upon the idea that Dumbo flew.  Some crows nearby take an interest in these two, and break out into song, singing a delightful tune &quot;When I see an elephant fly&quot;.<br />Of course this is too much for Dumbo, and he can't bring himself to believe he can actually fly.However, Timothy coaxes him to trying to fly.  Timothy also gives Dumbo a &quot;magic&quot; feather, which he says will allow him to fly as long as he holds on to it.  Low and behold, the feather seems to work; for Dumbo is flying!<br />Now that Dumbo can fly, apparently through the power of the feather, what are the circus people to do with him?  What are they to make of him?  And will the other elephants begin to show him more respect, and stop taunting him?<br />&quot;Dumbo&quot; is a story many of us can relate to, especially for those of us who have been taunted and teased during some dark time in our lives for a particular &quot;flaw&quot; we might have upon our person; something which others find to be worth attacking and critizing.  Dumbo perseveres, and he shows us we can too.  He also shows us that we need not hide our flaws, but wear them openly, with pride.
B00005OBSD|5.0|Their first album made more enjoyable by the remastering. Contains great tracks such as Walk in the Shadow, I'm a Mover and Sweet Tooth and many more. The bonus tracks are excellent also!
B00003CXZ4|5.0|I won't belabor much over what the other positive reviewers have said, except to say that it felt much like reading a mystery novel starting with the last chapter, and proceeding backwards from there.  The suspense lingers even more, as the biggest foil for Leonard to solving the mystery of who raped and killed his wife is his &quot;condition&quot;.  Moreover, by reversing the order of the presentation of events, the movie, then, is essentially shot as a reconstruction of memories leading backward to the pivotal moment that sets the events in motion, which is precisely what Leonard is lacking.  If this were the same story, with the same character, but with the scenes portrayed in normal order, this would have been a completely different movie.<br />But even beyond the mystery element of the story, the movie is also a character profile, of a man seeking revenge for the rape and murder of his wife, yet in all likelihood won't remember the satisfaction of getting that revenge.  As the viewer is taken back closer and closer to the beginning, we get a better idea of how and why the messages on the photos and Leonard's body were put there.  The suprises here, again, only could be revealed if the movie started at the end and went backwards.<br />I don't watch movies much any more.  But I'm glad I saw this one.
0385505833|5.0|It's not mind-bending, it's not earth shattering. It's just a sweet little story about a couple, Nora and Luther Krank, who decide to rebel against the commercialism of Christmas. I didn't see the ending coming at all (I'm apparently slow, as well), so it was a nice surprise. This book is an easy read, even for someone like me, who doesn't do a lot of reading. I'd recommend it -- in fact, I did recommend it to a total stranger, just today.
B00003CXS4|5.0|Jewel thief Franky Four Fingers(Benicio Del Toro) steals an 86 karrat diamond for his boss Avi(Dennis Farrina). But Franky is set up by a psychotic, sneaky Russian mobster named Boris the Blade(Rade Sherbedgia), he asks Franky to place a bet down for him at a bookies. Franky unwittingly agrees.... What Franky doesn't know is that Boris hired two pawn shop owners (Robbie Gee and Lennie James) to rob Franky and take the briefcase which contains the diamond inside. Things go awry and the 2 pawn shop owners are caught up in the middle of this diamond war. Meanwhile in London two boxing promoters-Turkish and Tommy (Jason Statham and Stephen Graham)are looking to strike it big with the bare knuckling boxing champ One Punch Mickey O'Neil(Brad Pitt). They've got him set to take a dive in a boxing match rigged by crime lord Bricktop(Alan Ford). What they didn't know is that Mickey can knock a man out with one punch, hence the name ONE PUNCH MICKEY. So of course Mickey knocks out his opponent in the first round and gets into a little trouble. Bricktop gives Turkish, Tommy and Mickey one more chance to do it right and if they fail then it's &quot;OINK OINK&quot;......... Avi travels to London and teams up with his cousin Doug aka The Head(Mike Reid) in attempt to retreat the missing diamond along with four fingered Franky. But Avi gets pissed and hires Bullet Tooth Tony(Vinnie Jones) to deal out some major payback. The last man standing gets the diamond!  <br />Snatch on DVD is a dream come true for fans of the movie! It's loaded with awesome features! Snatch was born to be on DVD! The picture is astounding! The sound is astonishing! The overall content of the film and DVD is perfect! A 2 disc SPECIAL EDITION is exactly what I wanted and exactly what I was hoping for! I must have seen this movie about 17 times in the theater! It's one of those films that never get boring and always stays at the top! <br />If you like Quentin Tarantino films and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels you will LOVE Snatch! It's awesome!<br />It's brilliantly directed and filled with non-stop laughs, action and entertainment! <br />Check out SNATCH on DVD!
6305892806|5.0|I've read some of the reviews here and I cannot believe how much people missed out on the point of the movie and became so nit picky. I believe that Rozema's point was to take Jane Austen's life and intermix it with the one novel that was close to her actual experiences. Yes, it does stray fromt the original novel, but I don not see why that has to be a bad thing.<BR> As for the slavery and adultery issues, some reviewers are talking as if it never happened back then. It did. Jane Austen just couldn't write about it as explicitly. I think it adds credibility to the times the story is told in, not leading people to believe that everything was light-hearted and romantic. These people did earn their living from slavery and Ms. Rozema did an admirable and brave thing to bring that up. No, it isn't resolved at the end completely, but then slavery wasn't abolished until after the time period of the movie, so it's not that big of a deal.<BR> Bottom Line: the movie was well done. Frances O'Connor, Jonny Lee Miller, and the rest of the cast do an outstanding job. The movie should be taken as being &quot;inspired&quot; by Jane Austen's &quot;Mansfield Park&quot;, not as a page by page copy. A movie never beats reading the book, whether it does follow it strictly or not, so the two should be able to stand on their own. Both are interesting and important works of art.
B00003CXZ1|1.0|Excluding some rather cool special effects, the whole of this movie was DULL and BORING.  The plot was confusing -- a hodgepodge of standard pseudo-mystical elements brought out of some attic trunk.<br />Unless you're just turned on by a rather busty Angelina Jolie, I suggest you save your money.
B000001Y79|5.0|Though not a fan of much ska or hard rock music, this is a band I can't help loving. Beautiful, brilliant, thoughtful, creative and expressive, the sister and brother team of Gwen and Eric Stefani come together with three of their friends to create an album that knocked the socks off of everyone in the industry.<br /> From the satire in &quot;I'm Just A Girl&quot; to the metaphorical &quot;Spiderwebs,&quot; &quot;Excuse Me Mister,&quot; &quot;Sixteen,&quot; and &quot;Tragic Kingdom,&quot; the album displays what a rock band should be able to do. It's not just five people screaming about leprechauns only know what, it's five people dealing with problems of life- coming of age, discrimination, and unpleasant relationships. No candied apples or rainbows for this one of a kind band, only life experiences are expressed on No Doubt's debut album &quot;Tragic Kingdom.&quot; A must-own for anyone who loves music.
B000059XUO|5.0|The crow is about Eric Draven  a rock musican  who was brought back to life by the crow,he is after the people resonable for  his and his wife's death.When I saw this movie I wanted to   watch this movie forever,you'll love this movie I know it, you'll  think that your in heaven,so buy the crow on vhs or dvd!
B00003CXAA|3.0|I didn't read the customer review above about non-compatibility with some DVD players, and therefore cannot play the material I was most interested in seeing: the bonus disk. Truly a freaking gyp, and one for which I am very disappointed/mad with Partamount. Don't quite understand what the technical problem is, but the thought that they wouldn't be compatible with common brands (I also have a Pioneer player) is ludicrous. Backfire on you, studio boys--I'm never buying another one of your boxed sets again.
B00005OM4N|2.0|Here&#8217;s my breakdown (track by track) of the songs on Britney: <br />1. I&#8217;m A Slave For You <BR>My Score: 1/5 <BR>First Thought: <BR>This is a Britney song? <BR>The Good: <BR>It&#8217;s a new sound for Britney with some &#8216;edgy&#8217; lyrics. <BR>The Bad: <BR>I cannot stand this song. It&#8217;s one of those songs by Britney that gives me a pounding headache. <BR>After Hearing It Several Times In A Row: <BR>I&#8217;m left in agony from all this torture. <br />2. Overprotected <BR>My Score: 3/5 <BR>First Thought: <BR>Another &#8216;Stronger&#8217; (aka your typical empowered Britney song.) <BR>The Good: <BR>Now, this is freaky. I can actually relate to some of the lyrics in this song. Right when I think that I have come to the conclusion that all Britney songs are pathetic, elementary school-ish poems written by money-hungry adults who have no clue what they&#8217;re talking about, I come across a song that I can actually kind of relate to. Open mouth, insert foot. <BR>The Bad: <BR>Well, if you ignore the lyrics to this song, it&#8217;s really bad. Britney&#8217;s delivery is, as always, too perky for me to believe that she has any clue what she&#8217;s singing. The song itself is just your usual, below-average pop song. The only reason it got an ok rating from me was that the lyrics surprised me. <BR>After Hearing It Several Times In A Row: <BR>I forget that I liked that lyrics and just revel in the awfulness of the song. <BR>  <BR>3. Lonely <BR>My Score: 3/5 <BR>First Thought: <BR>Sounds like a remix of a song by Dream. <BR>The Good: <BR>It&#8217;s catchy and makes me feel like jumping around with my dog. (I have issues&#8230;) <BR>The Bad: <BR>I can&#8217;t say the lyrics this time since I can&#8217;t understand most of them. Basically, the problem with this song is that it&#8217;s so formulaic and boring. There are a million and two songs just like it. <BR>After Hearing It Several Times In A Row: <BR>I begin to like it and find myself singing the tune outloud. Like I said, it&#8217;s really catchy. <br />4. I&#8217;m Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman <BR>My Score: 5/5 <BR>First Thought: <BR>Sounds good. I think I&#8217;ll like this one. <BR>The Good: <BR>This is my favorite song on the CD. It&#8217;s slow, but sweet without being overly sappy. Britney almost shows some emotions in it. Plus, the lyrics aren&#8217;t that horrible. <BR>The Bad: <BR>There is just a touch of sappiness to it. Otherwise, it&#8217;s a pretty decent song, as far as Britney ballads go. <BR>After Hearing It Several Times In A Row: <BR>I start to drown in the sappiness and have to put on some Fiona Apple songs for a bit. <br />5. Boys <BR>My Score: 1/5 <BR>First Thought: <BR>Reminds me of an early Madonna song. <BR>The Good: <BR>Britney shows signs of maturity. Gone are the &#8216;baby baby&#8217; lyrics. Now, there are lyrics involving the word &#8216;sexy.&#8217; <BR>The Bad: <BR>The whole song. I really didn&#8217;t like this one. <BR>After Hearing It Several Times In A Row: <BR>I couldn&#8217;t bring myself to listen to it more than once. It was that bad. <br />6. Anticipating <BR>My Score: 2/5 <BR>First Thought: <BR>Sounds like a bad song from the 70s. <BR>The Good: <BR>This is definitely a different sound for Britney. <BR>The Bad: <br />Everything else. The lyrics, the tune, the vocals that sound like they&#8217;re by Mandy Moore. Ugh&#8230; <BR>After Hearing It Several Times In A Row: <BR>It actually started to grow on me. Scary&#8230; <br />7. I Love Rock And Roll <BR>My Score: 3/5 <BR>First Thought: <BR>No one should remake a Joan Jett song, especially Britney Spears. <BR>The Good: <BR>She remains faithful to the original version while adding some more modern, Britney-ish sounds. <BR>The Bad: <BR>If she had to go and remake a Joan Jett song, it should have been &#8216;Bad Reputation.&#8217; That would suit the Britney image better and would be like giving her critics- including me- the middle finger. <BR>After Hearing It Several TimesIn A Row: <BR>It really grew on me. I even started to almost question which version was better- the original or this one. Now, that&#8217;s scary&#8230; <br />8. Cinderella <BR>My Score: 4/5 <BR>First Thought: <BR>It sounds like she&#8217;s been taking lessons from Jessica Simpson on how to be the next Britney Spears. <BR>The Good: <BR>This is my second favorite song on the CD. It&#8217;s really catchy and a good pop song. <BR>The Bad: <BR>The lyrics are cheesy- though that really is a given since this is a Britney Spears song. Also, it really does sound like a Jessica Simpson song. <BR>After Hearing It Several Times In A Row: <BR>I start to get annoyed with it. I think it&#8217;s best to only listen to this one once or twice an hour or its charms start to weaken. <br />9. Let Me Be <BR>My Score: 2/5 <BR>First Thought: <BR>Sounds like a song that Jennifer Lopez would sing. <BR>The Good: <BR>It&#8217;s catchy and has a good beat. The lyrics aren&#8217;t that bad. <BR>The Bad: <BR>It&#8217;s too generic and screams &#8216;filler track.&#8217; <BR>After Hearing It Several Times In A Row: <BR>The refrain got stuck in my head. Also, I start to think that the song is actually a religious chant to make people want to buy Britney Spears&#8217; products. <br />10. Bombastic Love <BR>My Score: 2/5 <BR>First Thought: <BR>Weird. Very weird. This cannot be a Britney Spears song. <BR>The Good: <BR>It sounds very different from anything I would expect from her. I thought her voice sounded cool in it. <BR>The Bad: <BR>Besides the cheesy lyrics, it was too dramatic. It made me think that she was attempting an opera-like sound for it. And, if she was trying for an opera-ish sound, she came up a little short. The song just doesn&#8217;t flow very well.   <BR>After Hearing It Several Times In A Row: <BR>I like it less and less. I thought it was ok the first time I heard it, but after a second time, I couldn&#8217;t bring myself to listen to it again. <br />11. That&#8217;s Where You Take Me <BR>My Score: 3/5 <BR>First Thought: <BR>Sounds like your typical Britney ballad. <BR>The Good: <BR>The refrain. It&#8217;s so sweet and cutesy, I can&#8217;t help liking it- I am a girl after all. <BR>The Bad: <BR>Pretty much everything else. The lyrics are Britney at her corniest. The back-up vocals sound like they were done by Britney&#8217;s kid sister. Hmm&#8230; maybe they were. After all, I&#8217;ve heard that Britney&#8217;s sister is a performer&#8230; <BR>After Hearing It Several Times In A Row: <BR>The cheesiness of the lyrics really starts to show, but the sweetness of the tune grows on me. It takes me back to the songs I liked in pre-school. <br />12. What It&#8217;s Like To Be Me <BR>My Score: 2/5 <BR>First Thought: <BR>Oh, God. Britney is not attempting R&B, is she???? <BR>The Good: <BR>It&#8217;s a new sound for Britney. She actually isn&#8217;t that bad at R&B. This song could&#8217;ve been much worse. <BR>The Bad: <BR>Need I say the lyrics? Also, it felt out of place with the rest of the CD. <BR>After Hearing It Several Times In A Row: <br />I go from hating it to having neutral feelings. I realize it&#8217;s not my kind of song, but some people might actually like it. (...)
B00005R2M3|5.0|Shakira came up with her debut in English and let us fans more than happy. The four spanish tracks in the CD deliver undiluted Shakira, the same quirky observations about life and relationships that she's given us in &quot;Donde estn los ladrones&quot; and &quot;Pies Descalzos&quot; with the world beats and Latin influences she knows so well how to mix. As for the songs in english, her fire and passion come across, with a mixed message of a new sweetness in her raw voice and the promise of more to enjoy when the new language ceases to be so unfamiliar. I really enjoy her new work and I listen to it all the time. She's still able to put words to my innermost feelings, no matter in what language she wrote the song!
B000002HH2|5.0|Following a multi-platinum selling \\"Debut\\" album was going to be tricky stuff. After cooking eggs in the kitchen with only her own naughty thoughts to keep her company and dancing along a massive 18-wheeler driving through New York whilst singing about an imminent bout of sexual pleasure (paging Dr. Freud!), Björk fights back at the sophomore slump with what is her best album ever. \\"Debut\\" acted as Björk's jumping platform, now with a small army of some of the key perpetrators of some of the most noteworthy dance music around (Graham Massey, Tricky, Marius de Vries and \\"Debut's\\" Nellee Hooper), Björk creates some groovy, heartbreaking dance tunes as well as some of the best love songs put into recording. You can discuss the validity of that claim, but it's true! So there!<br />The first second of the first song of the album, the literally explosive \\"Army Of Me\\", confirms that Björk's taking us somewhere else in terms of her sound; a new Björk emerges here, with an embittered resilience that could rival Alanis Morissette's work on her LP, \\"Jagged Little Pill\\". Comparisons with the Canadian Angst-master are quickly quelled however, when the authoritative opener segues into \\"Hyperballad\\", easily one of the best love songs ever (like I said, you can discuss this). All strings and dance beats and keyboards and all sorts of cool sounds I can't really describe as good as everyone else has done before, it is the album's standout track.<br />`Eclecticism' could have been the title for \\"Post\\", but Björk isn't trying to be nudge-nudge-wink-wink-clever-clever here; she is at her emotional pique and investing dance music with a soul as well as a toe-tapping melody. This is largely due to both her voice, which has been critically praised everywhere (and justly so) so I'm not going into that now, and her collaborators. Former member of Massive Attack, Tricky, invests Björk with some darker, sexy beats on \\"Enjoy\\" and definitely the album's closing piece, \\"Headphones\\". EumirDeodato's arrangements on \\"Hyberballad\\", \\"You've Been Flirting Again\\" and especially \\"Isobel\\" invest Björk's songs with an arrestingly timeless feel. And Hooper is with the girl every step of the way; in particular the remaining strings that close \\"Hyperballad\\" are so swooningly romantic they actually sound like they're from Baz Luhrmann's \\"William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet\\", which Hooper did the music for. \\"Possibly Maybe\\" reps a worthy mention for its otherworldly romantics which sound like something out of \\"Twin Peaks\\", or at least remind me of those American indie-curios no one sees but in a just world they would have.<br />The only problem I find with \\"Post\\" is that everything is so good that it reps as a pique too early in Björk's career as a musical phenomenon; but, as follow-ups go, \\"Post\\" isn't a step in the right direction, it's a 100 mile sprint.<br />Must Hears: \\"Hyperballad\\", \\"Isobel\\", \\"Possibly Maybe\\"
B00000BKE1|5.0|Since, it's release in 1992, &quot;Fear Of The Dark&quot; has received mixed reactions.  There are some people who will tell you that it is a good, solid record, and others who will tell you that this album is only mediocre.  Unfortunatley, this album is unfairly judged because many people still hadn't adjusted to the departure of Adrian Smith, and the arrival of new guitarist Janick Gers.  Janick is a great guitarist and he sounds very good on this album.  I don't understand why some Maiden fans don't like this record.  There are some great songs on here.  Of the four Maiden albums that Janick played on, and Adrian didn't, this is without a doubt the best one.<br />There are 5 classic Maiden songs on here that should be appriciated by every Maiden fan.  The five songs are:<BR>1)BE QUICK OR BE DEAD -- a heavy hitting, hard rocking, song that provides a great opening for the album.  This song is not only the best song on the album, but is one of Maiden's best songs ever in my opinion. <BR>2)FROM HERE TO ETERNITY--Another heavy song that should not be forgotten.  This song is actually rumored to be the fourth part of the 'Charlotte the Harlot' series.  Judge for yourself on that one, but you will agree that this song rocks.<BR>3)AFRAID TO SHOOT STRANGERS--A Steve Harris song that is considered by Steve himself to be one of his strongest songs he ever wrote.  This one starts off really soft before kicking in to the familiar high energy Maiden sound.<BR>4)WASTING LOVE-- Sort of a Maiden 'power ballad.'  This song sounds different from anything Maiden had done up till that point, but it turned out great.  <BR>5)FEAR OF THE DARK--For those of you that haven't heard this album, if you have been to a Maiden concert in the last eight or nine years, you have probably heard this song. This is a great song to play live, and the reason is it's catchy melody at the beginning, and then the fast and heavy verse that explodes out of nowhere.  Listen to the beginning and I'm sure you'll recognize it.<br />There are seven remaining tracks on the album that don't quite stand up when compared to the other five, but rock nonetheless.  Listen to the catchiness of the choruses on songs like 'Chains Of Misery' and 'Weekend Warrior' and the intro to 'Judas Be My Guide' and it's hard to argue that these aren't very good songs. They may not be the album's highlights, but they are far from album filler.
0790729644|1.0|For some reason the Academy felt that a &quot;Lifetime Achievement&quot; award for Clint Eastwood was not sufficient, so they gave this horrible movie a &quot;Best Picture&quot; award.  Watch this before you ever consider buying it ! ! !
B00005QG9J|5.0|Well, after some of the reviews I have read, I see that alot of people failo to notice the real musicality of this album compared to their previous efforts. Sure, Make Yourself (M.Y.) was their breakthrough album, which is good, but Morning View (M.V., for short) stands high above the rest. Although cheesy, I'll do a run down of the songs in a 0-5 basis.<br />1. Nice to Know You (4.9/5) This was the perfect opener, it shows that DJ Kilmore is more about sculling the water, not necessarily making splashes. <br />2. Circles (5/5) I love the guitar line.<br />3. I Wish You Were Here (4/5) Good song, too much airplay ruins this song for me. The same thing happened with Hash Pipe (Weezer). It's a great song, but with MTV and the radio networks, it gets overplayed, and when you hear it on the album, it isn't the same. Oh well.<br />4. Just A Phase (5/5) Finally, something experimental. The first 3 songs basicall followed the Incubus tried-n'-true method, which is good. Phase uses different elements that the previous albums haven't.<br />5. 11 A.M. (5/5) No explanation necesasary.<br />6. Blood on the Ground (6/5) This is byfar the best song on the album. Its upbeat, it displays all of their talents, especially Brandon's singing and songwriting abilities. I'm such a loser that I write the lyrics of this song on my text books when I get bored....<br />7. Mexico (5/5) Similar to Drive, but better, because once again, it displays Brandon's improvement of being a songwriter and a singer, not a screamer/yeller, like what happens in most rock bands nowadays. Not that there is anything wrong with that, but this album takes the road less traveled.<br />8.Warning! (4/5) This song is pretty cool, but it gets kind of annoying after awhile for me, and compared to the other songs, its not as high caliber as the other tracks...<br />9.Echo (5/5) This is close to pop, but I like it all the same. It's catchy!<br />10.Have You Ever? (4/5) Trying to get a little back to their roots, this song is pretty cool... I like the other &quot;hard&quot; songs on the album better.<br />11. Are You In? (5/5) The other poppish songs, I like this one too, it is relaxing, but not as much as others...<br />12. Under My Umbrella (5.5/6) This is my 3rd favorite track... It just sounds awesome. 'Nuf said.<br />13. Aqueous Transmission (7/5) Props to being original, and really pushing the envelope. This is one of my favorite songs on the album. The kyoto makes you want to fall asleep, and the string section adds the perfect touch. It's a beautiful thing.<br />When the smoke has cleared, if you respect yourself at all, you'll go buy this album...
B00005QIPH|3.0|This is a great album, don't get me wrong- it just could've been done with a bit more variety in mind... I mean, the formula's very cool. However, that's it's problem- it relies too much on that one formula, and becomes sort of one-dimensional. But, hey, if you have a little extra cash on ya, pick this one up. It can be good from time to time. BTW, even for the lack of electicism, the bassist is *extremely* tasteful.
B000002GY9|5.0|...to a hotel someplace, and a wound that will never heal.<BR>This quote from Tom Traubert's Blues sums up this album pretty well, it got a moody and dark tone to it. Again we are in Waits' universe of lonely ramblers, and late night diners, and again Waits create an imense feel of lonley bars, smoke hanging thick, the drunk elbowed up at the bar, and the lonley musician at the piano. I don't think I can single out any tracks as being the &quot;best&quot; this album seems to have a contiuance to it, where each song lead up to the next, and it seems to be in perfect balance and harmony...righ from the intro of Tom Traubert's Blues, to the scatting Step Right Up to the closing track I can't Wait to Get Off Work. This album is &quot;classic&quot; Waits, before he started to experiment in the more alternative genres. Not saying experimenting is bad, I just prefer his earlier works, even though I love the later albums too. This one is certainly a classic
0800187881|1.0|I always felt that any moviegoer has a right to expect to be entertained at some level  when devoting some hours with a video or in a theater. Let me humbly suggest to a movie fan..You would get more satisfaction out a film such as &quot; The Deadly Mantis&quot; than you would watching this abomination. <br />I gave this film one star because a truly fine actor Jeff Bridges, is in this drivel...and because any film with sprocket holes is the result of someones effort...however misguided.<br />CP
B000002GWJ|5.0|The album title pretty much sums it up, this is a very dark and moody album, and more experimenting. It gives us a hint about what is to come later from Waits. The album is a great one none the less. Very cynical at times and very romantic at others, listen to songs like Christmas Card... and Old Shoes. Waits also mannages to make a (very strange) cover of Somewhere(from West Side Story), which some love and some hate. The album is so filled with emotions and feelings. Lost love and sorrow, and Waits give us his heart on a plate on this one. An album that at the same time is gruff and beautiful. Waits somehow mannages to make it both.
B000050XEI|5.0|Enya has always been one of my favorites, ever since I was small. Something about her voice and music style are just enchanting. My mom has all her albums, so of course she bought this one as soon as it came out. So I burned a copy for me and let me tell you, this is Enya at her best. This album just goes to show how talented and beatiful she can be. She is a trademark of new age and freshness, and I recommend this album to anyone. It can uplift your spirits and make your day.
B000002GYR|5.0|This is Tom Waits debut-recording and somewhat &quot;softer&quot; than his later releases, but here he starts his visit...through blues, jazz and waltz. Even though the vocal is softer, you can still see the influence on some tracks, which will become apparent in releases such as The Heart of Saturday Night and Small Change. Even though it is more low-key than the later 70's releases this is by all means a great album from one(in my opinion) most gifted musicians around. This was the first album, and thus also what caved the way for Wait's later cult-following.<BR>The album is not as &quot;harmonic&quot; as Small Change, even though the constant melancholy is apparent on tracks like Martha and Grapefruit Moon. This is (also) an instant classic from Waits and a must have for all fans of his early stuff.
B00004TWZF|5.0|.<BR>Director's cut editions arent always a good thing (lots of deleted scenes found their way back to the original &quot;fast&quot; editing),<BR>but i enjoyed every minute of this flick. its Bason at his best (almost), a magical movie, with a killer sound track.<BR>for home theater only!!!
B000002GYG|5.0|This is not what I would consider a live album per se, as it was set up in a studio, but none the less the audience and Waits' jokes and monologues give the album a most special &quot;feel&quot;. The album continues much in the same vein as Small Change, but with the added audience the barroom feel is overwhelming, imagining Waits and his 3 man ensemble(which by the way do a great job) on the stage in a smoke filled bar(I know they are not in a bar, but in a studio, but one can imagine), right from the start the illusion and the feeling is created untill it culminates in Waits cover of Big Joe and Phantom 309, and the Spare Parts II(and closing) he make a very amuzing presentation of the band, and a strange farewell. A classic.
B00005ASOI|5.0|Dario Argento's Suspiria is one of those truly must-own DVDs for anyone with a remote interest in the horror and suspense genres.  After several viewings I have decided it is one of my favorite films; beautifully photographed with an emphasis on eerie primary colors, and looking like it was filmed last year rather than back in 1977, it is further enhanced by Goblin's ultra-creepy score which also sounds fresh and not dated in the least.  While the acting is only average (save the lead, Jessica Harper, who has some of the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen), and the story does at times seem slightly hackneyed, it has just the right amount of gore to please gorehounds while not alienating fans of more &quot;mainstream&quot; fare.  I could go on all day about the director's emphasis on style as a way to enhance mood; Hitchcock would surely have approved.  Suffice it to say that Suspiria has instantly become the crown jewel of my collection.  Put it on and have your friends try to guess what year it was made.  I now know I will spend part of my birthday money buying other selections from the Dario Argento collection.
B000002GXS|5.0|A more rough Waits than on the album Closing Time. Waits takes us to his universe of hookers, drunks, hobos and sailors on this briliant album. In songs like Fumblin' With the Blues and Drunk on the Moon you can allmost smell the filled ashtrays and old beer. This recording takes us from the depth of the urban jungle and back again. The title track have you imagining the almost abandoned diner, and the lonely sailor there. This is indeed a great album.
B00004X0M6|5.0|An excellent and very talented singer born in Italy that has exceeded in the last few years, each time coming out with even better songs than her latest CD, that have matured and evolved along with her voice. I have to say her songs are charged with positive energy and lots of real emotions that can be felt when you listen to her voice.  Very talented and professional.  I was fortunate enough to see her Live Concert 2001 World Tour in person and it was just extraordinary. <br />This CD and the new one she just released in October, Lo Mejor de...Volvere Junto a Ti 2001, (The Best of...Laura Pausini) or in Italian, has many of her greatest songs and hits and is definitely one for the collection. Best CD I have ever bought, this one and Lo Mejor de... Laura Pausini.  Great for all ages. <BR> <BR>Maravillosa Laura!    Enjoy.
0784010188|5.0|I seen T-2 when it was first released in movie theatres. Years later, its still as fresh and orignial as it was then. <br />If your collection only ever numbers one DVD, this should be it!!
B00003CXXI|5.0|Definitely a 5 star production! Appeals to all ages. A definite must for the family's entertainment collection! (When I took my family to see this film at the theatre, our ages ranged from 68 to 7 years old.) It was like a trip to an amusement park but even more amusing. This work of art is hilarious! I didn't know a thing about the story and was pleasantly surprised & enthralled with the magic. Creativity aand then some! The ending will have you rolling off the seat laughing! Shrek is so thoroughly entertaining, it's a most worthy of your time & money.
B00000K19E|5.0|Q. &quot;The Matrix&quot; is:<BR>     A. Intense.<BR>     B. Dazzling.<BR>     C. Entertaining.<BR>     D. Thrilling.<BR>     E. Awesome.<BR>     F. All of the above.<br />A. The answer is a most emphatic F. An everyday joe (Keanu Reeves) leads a double life. By day, he is a &quot;program writer for a respectable software company&quot;; by night, he lives in a squalid-looking apartment and is a hacker who goes by the alias &quot;Neo&quot;. He has a feeling that something is wrong with the world, and is obsessed with a man who is only known as Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne). One of his assistants, Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) arranges for Neo to meet Morpheus. At the meeting, Morpheus tells Neo the facts about the world.<br />This movie is definitely a movie for guys. Bombs, martial arts, guns, and even an Old West-style shootout in a subway station. One minor quirk about it: while the movie itself was shot in Sydney, Australia, the intersections that the various characters are told to go (Wells &amp; Lake, Franklin &amp; Erie, e.g.) are in Chicago.
B000003TAW|5.0|Some people seem to be confused and don't realize that they are writing green album reviews on the BLUE album page. It's not that complicated, come on. Anyways, this is an amazing cd. My favorite tracks are &quot;In The Garage&quot; and &quot;Surf Wax America&quot; but all of them are really good and fun to sing along to. So if you're looking for some fun and not to hard rock, look no farther than Weezer's BLUE album.
0440219078|5.0|I am a fifth grade teacher and read this novel silently during Reading Workshop.  Each day, reading workshop would last longer and longer because I was so absorbed in the book.  Many of my students inquired about this book while I was reading it during Reading Workshop.  I told everyone who asked that it was an absolutely wonderful book; however, I also only recommended the book to those students who had an open mind.  The book has some deep topics that might frighten some parents when they find their child is reading this book.  However, as a parent, myself, I wouldn't discourage my own child from reading it.  I love books that make you think.  This is one of those books.
0792151712|2.0|....but supprisingly kept me pretty entertained for over 3 hours. What really bothered me about this film was the overwhelming hype over a film that had a  terrible gym teacher style performance by Leonardo D' Caprio, a cheesy, annoying performance by Kate Winslet (who's highlight of the film was a mildly non-sexual nude scene), and an ignored, great performance by Billy Zane who played Winslet&quot;s violent tempered fiance. The plot: a romantic affair on the Titanic between a 3rd class boy Jack (Leonardo D' Caprio) and an engaged 1st class girl Rose(Kate Winslet). <br />The film (mostly in the opening scenes and the sinking of the ship.) is entertaining. The scenes in which Jack and Rose are in really hurt the film. The old Rose telling the story of the Titanic uses a bit of rather stupid dialouge (&quot;The china had never been used, the beds never slept in.&quot;) When I saw it I yelled &quot;Yea right!&quot;. <br />I would recommend this movie to those who can aviod the sappy love story and pay attention to the rousing scenes that focus on the ship. Peace out!
630575067X|3.0|George Luicas took a long time before putting out this DVD, and as an extra features two disc set, it is excellent. (...) I found Episode I boring and lackluster.   Iam Neesen just seems bored by it all and somnambulates himself through the film.<br />The CG effects are too obtrusive and all over the place.<br />I suggest renting this but don't spend your money buyong it even thogh it is not expensive.
B00005U18E|4.0|This movie, a modern readpatation of Pride and Prejudice, is soo good.  I have read both books, and while it is not exactly the same, the spirit of the movie is.  Renee Zellwegger plays a great Bridget Jones and it is very easy to relate to her as the average woman.  Colin Firth, is of course the perfect Mr. Darcy as is Hugh Grant, who plays a very different character than what we are used to seeing in his movies.  I highly recommend this (single or not) if you want a good laugh and a happy ending.
B00001OH1S|3.0|After 66 other reviews, I can't say much more. Wonderful songs featured, but key songs missing. I too am seeking the titles and artists of the missing songs.<br />An enhanced CD with the missing songs and longer versions of the existing songs is needed to make this jewel perfect.

B00000IPAX|2.0|ok,to get started,i'm not really a big fan of punk rock.the only punk rock cds i own is this and sum 41's al killer no filler.i bought this cd for the songs &quot;all the small things&quot;,&quot;adam's song&quot;,and &quot;what's my age again?&quot;.at first i liked them,but after a few listenings,they got old.all punk rock does to me.it's just boring.it's still in my cd case,i listen to it SOMETIMES,but not much.don't buy this if you dont like punk.
B000000W71|5.0|Belive it or not..I never know that the electric guitar can produce such a beautiful melodies until i heard the songs of the one and only Gary Moore. Oh my god what a artist he is...Though i was a biggest fan of SCORPIONS  i love to hear gary moore too...this cd contains finest songs of gary moore like persianne walkways, still got the blues, with love, empty rooms,always gonna love you etc.... one of my top recommndations to you..go get it...you will never regret of it...
B00003CXTG|1.0|I knew I would hate this film even before I saw it.  Why?  Because it's trying to be like Titanic but it doesn't even come close.  First of all, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet made the audience believe they are in love and that is not the case with Pearl Harbor's stupid love triangle.  Ben Affleck is a terrible actor and Kate Beckinsale does a good job of being one of the worst actresses of our time.  Josh Hartnett does what he can with the poorly written role he was given, but the only good performance comes from Cuba Gooding, Jr.  His performance was emotional and amazing, but that was the only good thing about this film.  I hope everyone involved with this film are ashamed of it.  That's how BAD this movie is.
