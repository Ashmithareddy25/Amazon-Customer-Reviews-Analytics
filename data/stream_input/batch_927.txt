0316666343|4.0|\\"Lovely Bones\\" is a beautifully written take on the murder of a girl and its effect on her family.  Sebold also manages to make a surprising literary device work:  the narrator is the girl herself, now in heaven.  Sebold provides some details about heaven, or kind of a pre-heaven, but is careful not to try too much (cf. to last chapter of Dara Horn's \\"TheWorld to Come\\" which I did not like at all).     Sebold throws in a feminist angle (Susie's mother, also Ruana).  While not done badly,  I wonder if it may have been required only because Sebold's literary imagination needed another crutch;  to my mind, it muddies the tragedy's after affects.
0545101417|5.0|First of all, I'm not a \\"young adult\\" but I absolutely love this series.  The characters are deep and real and the plotlines are exciting and interesting.<br /><br />I downloaded and listened to this audiobook as soon as it was available and I was not disappointed.  The reader is the same from the Hunger Games and provides an excellent interpretation of the text.<br /><br />As for the plot, it is nearly as good as the first (it falls short only because of the lack of \\"newness\\" in parts.  Since the reader has already been introduced to the arena, you already know what to expect with the training, interviews, etc.<br /><br />Without giving anything away, I found the plot interesting and unexpected with a fantastic ending.  I am anxiously awaiting the next book!
0439023491|4.0|Loved it.  This does well to maintain the intensity of the first book, The Hunger Games, but the cliff-hanger at the end leaves me wishing I hadn't read this book until the third and final book is in my hands.
B00006RINF|5.0|Lacuna Coil sounds different on each album and this has to be my favorite.  This one is rock with a touch of goth and almost every song sounds like it was musically worked to perfection.  Sound quality is top-notch.  The radio singles are pretty good but the rest of the album is even better.
B000006U44|5.0|Recorded in 1978 when Kate Bush was just 19 years old, \\"The Kick Inside\\" is a timeless album of songs that are far too real and vast for the media they were recorded on. It is sensual, daring, funky, and at times haunting. Such a strong debut, which followed the dramatic and unforgettable first single \\"Wuthering Heights\\".    Being a natural talent, Kate is a phenomenal songwriter. The lyrics within \\"The Kick Inside\\" show maturity beyond her age(some of the songs were written when she was just 13, including \\"The Man With The Child In His Eyes\\", which was the second single). Her words are much more potent and effective when sung with such a powerful, yet innocent, voice.    As with most of Kate's albums, every song plays a cohessive role. To skip a tune or two would be missing out on the entire picture, and you will feel the same after a few good listens. The opening song, \\"Moving\\", fades in with whale song, then a deep bass line brings in Kate's opening lyrics, followed by a slow to mid-tempo groove accented by piano, which carries the rest of this excellent song. \\"Kite\\" rolls along with reggae styling over a carnival undertone. \\"James and the Cold Gun\\" is the fastest song here and it rocks with a great guitar riff. Also, the title track acts as a perfect ending to the album. It is filled with melancholy.    What cannot be overlooked is Kate's beautifully played classical-style piano. With each song she hits all the right notes, whether it be modestly within the music or when the piano takes the lead.    As a whole, \\"The Kick Inside\\" will seep into your heart and bury itself deep in your soul. It was clear back in 1978 and it still stands...there will never be another Kate Bush.    5 Stars!
1878424432|5.0|Don Miguel Ruiz created in my opinion as classic that will stand the test of time over even centuries.  He discusses the importance of one's word and the meaning of it in life.  This is a powerful book.  I've listened to it numerous times and always was glad I did.  I intend to keep doing so.<br /><br />My review is not meant to be a gushing endorsement.  I have always found the introduction to be boring and not at all a good contribution to the excellent work that follows.  I find that unfortunate.  I'm afraid that if I recommend this book to somebody, the first 25 minutes will turn them off as it continues to turn me off.  This is my warning about the book.<br /><br />The Four Agreements is a very difficult book to recommend.  I've tried.  There's no way I can talk about it without the person I'm talking to showing visible signs of boredom.  It might be the way I describe it but I think it has something to do with the nature of the material.  The rules for living one's life, the truisms, don't lend themselves to excitement when discussed.<br /><br />One can see that the Toltec-based philosophy was highly developed.  Those ancient people had truly complicated thought processes and used experience and logic to arrive at a very concise and yet sophisticated set of rules for living a good life.  Thankfully we have not lost the hard-earned wisdom of the ancients!<br /><br />Here are the 4 Agreements, the treasures of the ancient Toltec people passed onto us:<br />Be Impeccable With Your Words<br />Don't Take Anything Personally<br />Don't Make Assumptions<br />Always Do Your Best<br /><br />The explanations underlying these agreements give them great meaning.  This is a great book with in my opinion a somewhat boring introduction.
B0014I4KH6|4.0|Well-written songs performed in a style that's enjoyable to listen to.  Not quite as good as Fearless, but well worth owning.
B000683VI4|5.0|I LOVE LOVE STORY'S AND THIS MOVIE IS THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN...NO LIE!!! I LOVE THIS MOVIE SO MUCH YOU CAN WATCH IT WITH YOUR HUSBAND AND I BET HE WILL LOVE IT 2!!!! THIS IS SUCH A GOOD MOVIE...IT'S SO CLASSIC THIS IS THE TYPE OF MOVIE WHERE YOU IMAGINE THAT YOU ARE THE GIRL LOL! IT'S SO AWESOME! I CANT STOP TALKING ABOUT IT! READER GET THIS MOVIE YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT.
0385504225|5.0|I liked it a lot. Its fun and fast paced. It was easy to follow and seemed genuinely authentic; as if it could really be true. Good book!
0671433784|5.0|I bought this for one of my kids for a literature class.  It met the requirements and was in good condition. What else is there to say?
0307266303|5.0|I bought this book based on the summary and the positive reviews.  The book not only met my expectations, but exceeded them.  First, the author's writing style is straight-forward and engaging.  The author deviates from the main story to give background on the different characters and the latest findings on the research of running.  Which leads to what exceeded my expectation.  The book is also well researched and the author shares what he has learned about running and it's history and, whether you agree or not, it gives you a lot to think about.  Finally, while I run for exercise, the book has motivated me to take it much more serious and with a new appreciation.<br /><br />A really great read whether you are into running or not.
B001GCUO1Q|5.0|Hugh JACKMAN hAS DONE IT AGAIN. This is a fast moving DVD. The action starts right from the start, and the action doesn't stop until the end. I highly recomend this DVD for all action lovers
0143144766|5.0|Ron McLarty's stage skills and films holds a familiar voice for many and provides a lively narrative style to INHERENT VICE, the story of a plot to kidnap a billionaire land developer, a romance, and Doc Spotello's ex-girlfriend, who lands him in much trouble. A complex series of encounters leads to high intrigue in this audio thriller, highly recommended for any lending library.
B0015XWUC2|4.0|Rick Astley may have suddenly have a second chance at being famous all over again. His voice is just perfect to get the message out of the song. No, his songs weren't political but more romantic and light-hearted in tone and harmony like \\"It would take a strong strong man\\" to never let you go or \\"Whenever You Need Somebody\\" as well as others on this compact disc. Remember before compact discs, audio cassettes and albums only held about 10-12 songs and rarely more. That is probably why more albums were done than now. This compact disc is perfect for your long drive home or just to relax on a rainy day.
B001P9KR8U|1.0|The initial DVD delivered was a bad product, and was replaced by Amazon the following week.
B002MW50KO|5.0|The only fair description of any Dylon work is brilliant.    From cranking his electric guitar to 11 in the face of folk music snobs in England in the 1960's (to his own financial and critical disdain) to never commenting ONCE on the almost universal scorn for his singing, Dylon is one of the great true artists of the past 100 years.    For those of you who STILL don't 'get' his work, turn off your speakers and print out his lyrics.    Read Dylon.    He ranks up there with Longfellow, Wordsworth, Thoreau, and Frost.    So he sings like an emphysemic pig?  Heck, so does your Uncle Sid, but you let him bellow on Xmas eve, don't you?
B002BBJ52U|3.0|Watch this movie for one reason. Because it shows desperate people who NEED to find someone constantly complain about how they can't find someone. If you watch this, and level with the characters. YOUR ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE I'M TALKING ABOUT. This movie is both cute and horrendous. It, like all movies since Amores Perros, and every movie in the last 7 years follows the same formula of, look 7 people, their lives intertwine. AMAZING. Which is more or less a good way of saying, we don't have a strong enough ensemble of characters as is, So, were just going to create a plate full of people, viewers are bound to like at least one of our 10 short stories, and the movie is great. I see it as lazy. Make 10 different movies then, but make each groups story so strong that it means something to us the viewer if their life doesn't go the way we hope it does. So, before I start cursing, I'll get back to the movie. It's cute at times. But it certainly a reflection of how sad and desperate people are these days. And I can't get much into that. I have a girlfriend, I love her, if we break up. Well, then I won't have to cook dinner for 2 anymore. What's the problem? I don't cry and overanaylze everything from this day forth in my constant need to find love and companionship. And, this movie, while at times an accurate look at life, makes me upset that people are actually like this. My advice, go rent \\"Love Actually.\\" It's the better version of this movie.
0439023491|5.0|This was an excellent second to the Hunger Games series.  Katniss has survived the games and is playing at being in love with Peeta.  But is he?  She's returned home and soon after is threatened by the president that she must convince everyone in the districts that she is madly in love with Peeta or all her loved ones will suffer.  But she isn't in love with Peeta or is she?  The 75th anniversary of the games brings a special game.  All the previous victors are being brought back into the drawing to compete in the arena once again.  All of this is due to Katniss and Peeta's win.  Some of these winners are elderly or sickly and have no business in a fight to the death.  Shallow alliances are made for the arena and the games begin.  President Snow is hoping to curb the rebellion that seems to be happening in all districts but the outcome he's looking for isn't meant to be.<br /><br />The end of this book leaves you needing more.  District 12 is gone, Peeta is in the Capital's custody and Katniss is in Gale's care.  This book will grab you from the start and makes it almost painful to put down because you just want to keep reading.  I can't wait until the next book is released; it's taking way too long.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|As \\"comeback\\" albums go, this is one of the best I've ever heard.  True to their classic sound, yet fresh and original.  Every song on this album is well thought-out.  Sludgy, spooky, edgy, heavy...some acoustic stuff...just like you remember them....and no filler.    I know that sounds too good to be true, like a rabid fan who refuses to see the cracks showing.  But as a cynic who'd rather see most bands quit on a high note (or a tragic event, in some cases) than go through a slow, embarrassing fade-out or make clumsy, ill-fated attempts to get back on the map after years of dormancy, I was pleasantly surprised by this one.  I encourage you to check it out.
B000VWYNNW|5.0|THE SONG REMAINS THE SAME collectors edition is OUTSTANDING AND PHENOMENAL. The music remastered is superior. The songs and footage are crisp. rich, deep, and moving. Inside the box there's this fantastic duplication of tickets, photos of the band members - up close and definitely good enough to frame. I'm actually holding a replica of the \\"World Premiere\\" for the movie - dated Tuesday October 19, 1976 (wow tomorrow is the day of the 23rd anniversary of that grand event! Cool! ) It's a ticket for \\"CINEMA 1 - 3rd Ave, N.Y.C. - get this - the \\"cost\\" to see that premiere at that time was a donation of $3.50 (three dollars and fifty cents) proceeds for the benefit of SAVE THE CHILDREN FEDERATION.<br /><br />You see, this set is much more than music and a movie. Their hearts were reaching out to help children from the beginning. Their lives, and souls infused everything they created - which is WHY it NEVER gets old! And I am positive that twenty three years nearly to the exact day of this event - that it STILL has so MUCH appeal - is a statement to each of the gifted band Members.<br /><br />I BLAST this and every other Zeppelin CD in my car - like a fifteen year old, and am just as taken with the music and the memorabilia as I was when back in the 70's you could go to a \\"head shop\\" and buy 6 ft. posters of Page, Plant - that used to line my bedroom walls.<br /><br />This set can be most appreciated by anyone, but especially fans as we vividly remember all of this coming out at the time.<br />And, they have a new generation of fans - such as my daughter - we love singing the songs in the car - and it makes for great memories.<br /><br />THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR KEEPING YOUR MUSIC SO ALIVE, UPDATED WITH TECHNOLOGY, MEMORABILIA SETS - AND THE T-SHIRT THAT CAME WITH THIS SET IS THE SOFTEST T I've ever worn! Top Quality from the best musicians in rock history!<br /><br />(other than that, can't stand them ; )<br /><br />Whole lotts love,<br />Barb
0767903862|4.0|'In A Sunburnt Country'/'Down Under' is another entertaining Bryson travelogue, as he grapples with the Australian language, environment, wildlife, and vast distances. Australia is enourmous and incredibly diverse, but Bryson is able to provide a fairly comprehensive view of the country as a whole. He actually made a number of independent trips Down Under, all to different parts of the country, for this book.    As always, Bryson has done his homework, reciting an impressive series of historical and geographical facts of which even Australians may not be fully aware. However, it is important to emphasise that Bryson's main objective is to tell an entertaining story, so not every word needs to be taken literally. He will often exaggerate and stereotype for humour, he makes a few minor geographic errors here and there, and he seems to have let one bad incident in Darwin tar his view of the whole town. Nevertheless, most of the personal anecdotes and observations are so funny, you won't care if there's a little embellishment here and there.    It is clear Bryson loves Australia and its people, and as someone from Midwestern USA, he seems to feel an strong affinity with the Australian culture and lifestyle. Apart from a couple of individuals, Bryson in general has great respect for ordinary Australian people. There is little of the snarky cynicism and borderline-elitist sentiment which plagued 'The Lost Continent' on display here.    In all, this is a typically interesting (if not 100% accurate) Bryson book, which provides a reasonably informative and highly entertaining introduction to Australia.
B002OHDRF2|4.0|I saw this movie with my son, and it is nothing like the other movies but make a little bit of sense to me but I think it could have been a hell of alot better with fighting sequence and special effets. I understand why sam worthington is a terminator because of my states gov. not being able to film in it but yet they use the cg versiion of him, that was cool. on the other hand I think they should bring worthingtons caracter back for the next movie and give him more of a role as well as other cast members . and find someone other than christan bale.....
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Jane Austen's famous novel brought to life again with beautiful cinematography filmed on location in the United Kingdom.  This is the 2005 movie version about an elegant young gentleman (Mr. Darcy - played by Matthew McFadden) who was proud and the beautiful young lady  (Elizabeth - played by Kiera Knightly) who was prejudiced.  They spend most of their time hating each other until they find out they discover they love each other.<br /><br />It is charming, ancient romance story and interesting dialogue opens a window on the mores, culture and class distinctions of that time and culture (England near the end of the 18th Century).<br /><br />The cast is superb, Kiera Knightly, Matthew Macfadyen, Donald Sutherland, Brenda Biethyn, Judi Dench and many others.
B001SN78JO|3.0|A quick fluff movie that's fun for the first half and has a concept that is fun to think about applying to your own life (to some degree at least - ladies with dentures?).  Well, it's Hollywood fast food and degrades to a 'happy' formulaic ending.  \\"Liar Liar\\" followed a similar formula though with much better results.  I'd rent before buying.  I can't see anyone needing to see this twice but it won't bog you down or anything and it does conjure up possibilities.  I can think of worse 3 star movies.
B002DPH8VY|5.0|There are no words to describe how AMAZING this album is. From the beginning all its way through the end the music you find here is an unforgettable experience. Before I jump into conclusions with some of the songs let me tell you that this girl is so talented on her own terms. The production of the album is stunning and the arrangements of the instruments flow in such an incredible way and natural form that you might believe that perfection is what you hear. A piano here, an Arp there (such a beautiful inclusion to this record), an electric and acoustic guitar every now and then make the songs come up with their own personality.<br /><br />\\"Dogs days are over\\", \\"I'm not calling you a liar\\" and \\"Drumming song\\" fight againts the traditional way of a song structure... there's a point where you don't know what you're listening and yet, you can't stop tapping your foot on the floor at the rythm of the music. Great songs for sure. \\"Rabbit heart (raise it up)\\" (of course!!!), \\"Kiss with a fist\\" and \\"You've got the love\\" are meant to be the commercial ones??? on the record... not that they're less impressive because of this 'cause once you hear the first one you fall in love with it right away. To point out one of tem in particular, I find \\"My boy builds coffins\\" a masterpiece. For some reason everything falls right in place here.<br /><br />\\"Lungs\\" is by far one the best records of this year and for sure will be one of the best in the first decade of the 2000's. Because of projects like Florence + the machine and Bat for lashes (I must say), we know that if this kind of music is coming up from such young girls, we can expect a bright future for music itself. It is ok that we have ALL kinds of music: the bubblegum one (with all the annoying scene in the US), abstract one (a la Radiohead) and commercial-respected one (R.E.M., U2, Muse or even Placebo). But if we didn't have the independent one and all the UK scene going on, the whole music universe would be so predictable.
158270208X|5.0|If you've not seen the film then do so, if you've not read the book, WHY?<br />My wife and I use this gratitude book daily and I can honestly say, along with all of the other wonderful things The Secret has to offer, its useful, and very inspiring to write each day and remember what there is in this world to be grateful for, even if its just for the lead in your pencil...
B002S0OBFK|1.0|Just saw this \\"Blair Witch/Cloverfield/The Ring\\" hybrid in a crowded theatre.  I heard no tears of people weeping.  No one ran from the theatre unable to witness anymore.  Instead there were laughs throughout the entire film coming from the whole audience.  And they weren't laughs to cover deeper fears. The sad and simply fact is that this is NOT a scarey movie at all!<br /><br />The plot is trite, the actors obvious amateurs, the jolting scenes of terror are no more thrilling than going to a live Halloween scare-show and having a constumed employee jump out at you.<br /><br />Hype has elevated this film higher than the recent Balloon Boy's hoaxed lift.  (There is even a scene in this film involving an attic crawlspace:  I hope law enforcement checks out to see if Richard Henne and his family saw this movie and got their idea for the hideout for Falcon and the hoax notion from it, as the film is prefaced with a caption indicating it is a true story - which it is not - just as the UFO balloon story was bogus.)<br /><br />Don't fall for it:  Robert Wise's \\"The Haunting\\" is 100 times spookier and scarey than this cinema verite garbage. The original \\"Carnival of Souls\\" is 100 times spookier and scarier. There are hundreds of  movies scarier than this - primarily because this movie just ain't scarey!  It has been so overly hyped that expectations will be naturally and unnaturally high, but the film is, alas, as empty as the balloon UFO once it came to earth.<br /><br />I went into the theatre wishing to be truly frightened - and I, and the rest of the audience, found more to laugh at than to fear. A total waste of time.
B000RZIGVS|2.0|I am not very happy about this product - the seller stated that while the packaging had been damaged, the Dvds were in good shape - that was not true at all.  There were at least 4 dvds just in the first season group that could not be viewed.
B001ILHY2C|5.0|This is the review of Death Race the unrated version (111 minutes)in blu-ray, hi def (the disk contains 2 versions).<br /><br />WHAT A RIDE! Heard about \\"chic flicks\\", well this is definitely a guy film.  The experience was riveting and left us speechless.  We were transfixed by the non-stop marathon of cars, fights, violence and babes in hi-definition and incredible HD surround sound. Definately a testosterone ride/boost with no redeming qualities whatsoever: none, zippo.<br /><br />This movie is nearly two hours of pure escapist joy.<br />Besides extreme non-stop action, it includes an occasional cheesy slow-mo hair-waving in-the-air shots of \\"babes\\" getting in and out of cars. Campy yes. Boring no.<br />Fun yes.<br />Highly recommended for what it is: fights, extreme racing, lots of gritty action shots.<br />The end is kind of sappy but what else would you expect?<br />If you don't take yourself or your movies too seriously you will love this flick.<br /><br />Wanna laugh? -I actually bought this Blu-ray disc to test out my home theater sound --  only action Blu-ray I could find that day that had dts 6.1 sound. After using the opening scene a few times to demo the sound (the spatial quality of the sound is truly outstanding going around the room in a dramatic fashion), I put it aside.  Then one day after a long day outdoors, my brother, a friend and I decided to watch it while our respective spouses and daughters were busy elsewhere. The result is listed above.<br /><br />Ideal for a projector setup with very large screen. If you have a choice play it back using dts discrete multi-channel.
B00288KNL8|5.0|This is a pretty cute movie.  Wonderful visually.  I do think it maybe should be PG-13.  The one character has a giant chest which was a bit much for the adult's watching it even and quite a shock to us as well. It is a PG movie though and a Tim Burton so beware for little ones.  My 4 year old had seen it at his dad's house and said it was scary but he wanted it. I got and watched it first and could see where he was coming from. So if your little ones scare easy please watch it first and judge for yourself.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|One of the very best collections I have seen, done by the many varied artists from around the world. A real feeling of joy and belief shown by many.  Music really could change the world.
B00192IV0O|5.0|I own the vinyl record version of this album and listened to it the whole way through as soon as I got home, then listened to side B again because I liked that side the best.    There's a lot of fun songs to dance to besides \\"I Got a Feeling\\" and \\"Boom Boom Pow\\", and the whole album really moves.  There's not really any low or weak tracks.  I'm really surprised at some of the negative reviews on here.  I actually like this album about as much or more than Monkey Business and really can't see why some people are griping about this one.      The only bad thing I have to say is the vinyl didn't come with a lyric sheet which would've been nice.
0446402389|4.0|Yes, this is a highly effective and well written thriller that creates an atmospheric portrait of Stalinist Russia and doesn't let up on the tension.  The climax is pretty abrupt, and the killer's motivation isn't really plausible especially when you consider that the crimes have a clear basis in fact.  Nonetheless, this is a powerful book, remarkable for a first novel.<br /><br />However, readers should be aware that at about the half-way point there is the description of a child's murder that is profoundly disturbing.  I have read hundreds of thrillers (including James Ellroy and Thomas Harris) and can't think of an episode as horrid, partly because it is so well rendered.  I don't think this passage's inclusion in a book that aims to be entertaining, no matter how gritty, was wise and had it occurred earlier in the book I may well have stopped reading it.  Perhaps this was a rookie mistake, but it depressed me for days.  I admire this book, but by virtue of that one scene, I'm  not certain I could actually recommend it to anyone.
B00267N3DQ|5.0|I cannot say enough good things about this new Diamond Edition Combo of Disneys Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs!        First of all, Its a DVD + Blu-Ray Combo Pack. Whats nice about this is you can watch this on your Blu-Ray player at home and then take the other one in the car with you for the kids to watch while you drive.        Second, Disney has really outdone themselves with making their all time favorite into a High Definition Format. The colors are crisp and bright while you can notice more detail than ever before!! Its very exciting to watch a new version of an old movie in this way! You see things that you have never noticed before. Also, it has 7.1 Sound Quality so you get an EXCELLENT experience with this new Version!        Lastly, Its a 3 Disc Combo Pack! It has Games, An All-New Music Video, Backstage Behind the Scenes, A Karaoke Sing Along to \\"Heigh Ho\\" and an Exclusive Sneak Peek at Disneys The Princess And The Frog Plus lots more!!        Its also been named \\"The Greatest Animated Film of All Time\\" by the American Film Institute.        So what are you waiting for??? This Diamond Edition wont be around long!!
0385504225|5.0|I'm a big Dan Brown so needless to say I loved this book.  The fast moving plot and all the rich descriptions made me not want to quit reading.  In fact, I read it in one day.  The historical facts about how Washington was built held my attention and made me want to go back and visit D.C. to see what I missed on other trips.  I highly recommend \\"The Lost Symbol\\".
0141439513|4.0|Pride & Prejudice by Jane Austen has been made into several movies, and remained apart of High School reading lists for decades. It is a heart warming book that discusses family dynamics, true love, money, social order, first impressions and reputation.<br /><br />The story is told primarily in dialogue. This is perhaps why it has been able to be adapted into several movies. It is the story of the Bennet family and their romantic entanglements. Jane Bennet and her relationship with Mr. Bingley, as well as Eizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy. The interactions between Miss Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy are simply priceless. The famous proposal scene, and the line, \\"You are the last man in the world I could ever marry!\\" make this book an absolute gem.<br /><br />The only flaw with this book is the under developed characters. Only Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy go through changes. Even though the characters are under developed they are unforgettable. From Lady Catherine to Mr. Collins they are all very different. Read this book you will not be disappointed.
B0029O08WA|4.0|So I really thought I would be disappointed in the soundtrack when I didn't recognize a lot of the bands.  I was really looking forward to my guys Blue October appearing (disappointment). I must say that I really like all the songs with the exception of The Editors song which I thought sounded like a 60 year old Vegas lounge singer.  The 4.99 MP3 download was a bonus to say the least.  True Twihard fans will not be let down by this purchase.
0060254920|3.0|The classic children story book by Maurice Sendak is an innovative and unique tale. I found myself to be disappointed in the book. It is a rather violent book, for children to read. The images are fascinating but rather scary for younger children. There is nothing like Where the Wild Things Are, but perhaps that is not such a bad thing.
0061719544|5.0|I discovered Craig Ferguson quite by accident late one night in the first few months of his talk show when I couldn't sleep.  He was hysterically funny. I immediately began taping the show and watching it daily and laughing and laughing.  I've been to the show's taping at CBS a couple of times and went to Vegas to see him perform stand up there for the first time in the Tiffany showroom at the Tropicana, so I guess you could say I am a fan.  I also read his novel, Between The Bridge and the River, which I, and many others, thought was stunning.  I've also seen his films, which I thought were mediocre.  So I came to the book knowing quite a bit about Craig, and interested to hear his story.  By and large, I was not disappointed.  The thing that stands out the most for me was the prodigious amounts of alcohol he consumed and other drugs he took, and the absolute horror and destruction of being an alcoholic.  I know several people who were put in the ground way to early due to this disease, and know another, who recently finished her first rehab, but, after only six weeks of sobriety,  is back to hiding bottles behind the curtains.  That Craig managed to stop drinking and maintain his sobriety for 17 years is to his great credit.  I do wonder if he goes to daily AA meetings.  Just curious.  Anyway, I wish him  continued sobriety. Craig fell into peforming quite by accident, and has tried his hand at many aspects of entertainment.  I think he has found his niche on the Late Late Show were he has the freedom to do stand up and create crazy characters and skits. As a woman, however, I would like to see more women involved creatively in the show.  American On Purpose is a bit uneven; it is more detailed during the first part, but later on, Ferguson seems to gloss over certain aspects of his life -- maybe he just got tired of writing in so much detail.  For example, he spends lots of pages talking about his marriage to his first wife Anne, but his second wife, Sascha is notdiscussed much -- maybe this is \\"for legal reasons\\" as Craig would say.  Craig closes the book by saying that he is glad that in America no child of his will have to fight his way through school like he had to in Scotland.  This is a bit ingenuous given the violence and intimidation that goes on on a daily basis in some of America's poor, gang-infested neighborhoods like the south side of Chicago and South Central LA. Not all Americans can live in the Hollywood Hills like Craig does and send their children to private school with children of other celebrities like Craig can. Although Craig Ferguson is extremely talented, he is also extremely lucky. I hope as time goes on and his American citizenship sinks in, he will work to make America into the \\"dreamland\\" he imagined it to be.

B002QQ8HAG|5.0|Absolutely loved this documentary. It was fasinating to see how such a massive Vogue issue is put together. It also opened us up to the mysterious Anna Wintour without really removing any of her mystery as a very powerful fashion icon, or as a person. I don't know if this was due to the director, or Anna Wintour herself, but the documentary was effective in giving us just enough of Wintour so that we wanted to know more. Now, Grace Coddington. I could have done with MUCH less of her in the documentary. She came across as whining, tiring, angry, and bitter. I understand she doesn't get her way artistically with Wintour as much as she'd like, but geez . . . quit bitching about it, suck it up, and at least attempt to act like a professional . . . or move on. Coddington must really be excellent at her job; which, no doubt, is the only reason her bad attitude is tolerated at Vogue. I'd much rather work directly for a cold Anna Wintour than the angry, self-victimized Grace Coddington. It was strange to me that the other reviewers could only sing Coddington's praise . . . I found everything about her thoroughout the documentary -- short of her photos -- annoying as heck! Does this mean that artistic people are acceptable as emotional messes?

B002MW50KY|5.0|I don't usually do these reviews, but I have read so many unfavourable comments (those newspaper critics!) in such a short time about this album, I just hope I can help dispel some crazy myths.   Okay I'm a Dylan fan and I would buy this album anyway, and I guess I have learnt to expect the unexpected.  There has been a good deal of thought put into the production of the album overall.  Dylan sings each song with sincerity and integrity.  (Don't believe all that stuff about his croaky voice#.  The band is excellent and show their ability to play a wide range of musical styles again with intergity, the arrangements are authentic and suit each song exquisitely.   I put it proudly on the shelf with #okay) the only other Christmas album I have ever owned - Bells of Ireland by the Chieftains with guests(check it out too it is excellent#, as well as the Tom Waits live version of Silent Night.
B002KAJ0AO|5.0|I love this cd. I must admitt after Never Gone which was ok but not the best I was starting to think Bsb was finally going to be gone. But then came Unbreakable and I saw a glimmer of hope. And now This is Us, wow my Boys are really back.     It moves from pop to R&B to dance and I love it all. I love that some of the themes are more mature and I love that Nick sings about the booty...lol. Come on these men aren't boys anymore so singing about the booty is not that bad. I hope they keep moving in this direction and maturing their sound.    And omg they are still looking as hot as ever. I STILL MISS KEV though.
B001O2S7XA|5.0|I bought this toy at Walmart for $[...] (Sept-09) for my 4-yr old grandson.  He LOVES it, and I like it because it is only 27\\" long, and I can pick it up (even from the top loop) and move it. You can use any car with it, although it works best with the light-weight Trick-Tracks or Hot Wheels cars. The 5-packs of cars cost $[...].       The description on the box says \\"not for use with some cars\\", & I called Hot Wheels (Mattel) & the rep.said that some die-cast cars are too wide. The track comes with one car.     There's a drop-in ramp, and you can put in 2 or 3 cars and see how long it will work before they crash!  Cole likes this best of all.  The cars go through a motor (2-D batteries) that jets the cars around the loops.    Also - the rep. said that this set does NOT connect to other sets (contrary to what it says on the box - there is no exit track.  BTW- set up was easy for me. Buy it!
0439023483|5.0|Some people are picky eaters, but I am a picky reader. Within minutes of reading The Hunger Games, I was addicted to the book. The heart-pounding plot is filled with action that will make your adrenaline start to flow. The book is predictable, but you could never imagine what obstacles the characters have to endure to make the book happen the way it does.  Survival of the fittest is the way the game goes. In The Hunger Games, the world is split into twelve districts. Each year, one girl and one boy from each district, are chosen at random to compete to the death in The Hunger Games.  Some people view being chosen as a gift, while others think of it as the worst thing possible. Katniss is the girl from district twelve. During The Hunger Games, you will experience Katniss' journey from beginning to end, through the simple and difficult challenges that are thrown at her.   The Hunger Games is an extraordinary book. It is great for young adults, male and/or female. If you are a type of person that will stay up all night, reading a book to find out what happens next, then The Hunger Games is a good book for you.    ROM ML 7/8

B002K0WBYG|5.0|I don't understand how some of the reviewers didn't like this movie. I believe that their personalities must be like Sandra's character, way too uptight for their own good. My entire family enjoyed \\"The Proposal\\" and it's a good, fun movie that has a good pace, excellent cast and we've all had bosses like Sandra plays! If you like a light hearted, feel good movie that is fun than you will also enjoy this movie.<br /><br />The Blu-ray quality is nice & clean. Not the best picture I've seen but I give it a solid 8/10. I watched it on a Mits HC5000 1080p front projector, Panasonic DMP-BD60 Blu-ray player, on a Da-lite 106\\" screen. I also saved $10 with the on-line coupon which makes it an even better deal. I saw this in the theater with my family & we all knew when it was done that we would purchase it & enjoy it many times over.<br /><br />Sandra Bullock, Ryan Reynolds & the entire cast was excellent an a pleasure to watch.<br /><br />Highly recommended!!!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I haven't bought a workout tape in over 15 years. Always thought they were lame. Needed one because I cancelled my overpriced gym membership in NYC.     Always thought I was in fantastic shape. However, I started on level three and ended up on level two and one. Will need smaller hand weights because I don't want to stay on level one:-).    This DVD is amazing! The choice of levels is fantastic. It is very modern and effective. I am  astounded and supremely pleased with this DVD. Jillian Michaels is obviously a pioneer for the future of workout DVD's.
1595141715|4.0|13 reasons why is probably a book that should be required reading for middle school and high school students. Also parents that have teenage kids should probably read it as well. The reason for this is that some teens at some point in their life have the feeling that their life sucks and they should end it prematurely. This book is about the last words of Hannah Baker a high school girl who committed  suicide. She left behind 7 tapes with the thirteen reasons why she ended her life. Each reason is a story about a person who was a cause of her death. The stories main character is Clay Jensen a boy who was one of Hannah's friends. For some reason his name is on the tapes so he receives them. Clay becomes engrossed in that tapes and listens to them non stop. He follows his friends recorded words and discovers secrets that will change his life forever.    Rom IB 3/4

B001GM28HO|1.0|It is noteworthy that \\"lady gaga\\" likes to hide her face behind huge sunglasses or fans or whatever.  An apt change to her hit song should be \\"butter face.\\"  Her whole genre is all studio produced.  Listen to her range.  It's studio produced.  Nope.  I don't see why she's a hit.  Besides.  Who wants to look at a girl who is looking at girls?  And she's a disgrace to her Italian race.

0385504225|4.0|I downloaded Dan Brown's latest book on my Kindle the day it became available for two reasons:  (1) I'm a huge fan and (2) I was visiting Washington DC the same week it came out and I wanted to visit various sites in the book.  I was delighted to read it quickly and when on a personal tour of the Capital I pointed out to our guide several items for discussion which he knew nothing about, i.e., the painting of Washington (as a God) on ceiling of Capital dome and the indentations directly under the dome where the railings were at one time which surrounded the hole in the floor.  Also, at the B & B where we were staying our host worked for the architect's office at the Capital and we discussed the book on several occasions; Dan Brown does great research.  I did enjoy the book, would recommend the book, and will wait patiently until this book is made into a movie as well.  I just wish Ron Howard had selected another actor to play the lead role - he just doesn't fit to me.
B002K0WBXW|1.0|There was not much romance and not much comedy--other than forced comedy--in this movie. The chemistry just wasn't there for the main characters Andrew and Margaret. Their bickering, which was I think supposed to be funny, seemed more like real arguing and quickly became tiresome. I would have just turned the movie off, but I wanted to see if they could pull it out of the scrap heap at the end. There was one scene that made me laugh, but the rest of the movie was a wash out. If I had known it was this stupid, I would have saved myself $15. Now maybe you'll have that opportunity.

B002KDUDG6|4.0|Having only seen Michael Buble on his TV appearances, I wasn't certain what to expect from this album..  I found this to be enjoyable, appealing, and diverse.  Mr. Buble does a good job on the classics-'Cry Me A River\\", 'All I Do Is Dream of You'.. Very reminescent of the big band era.   'Crazy Love', 'At this Moment', and 'Georgia' were enjoyable..    All in all I thought this was a great 'sit on the couch by the fire and enjoy' album.. I would recommend it..
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|I am very suprised at the reviews I'm reading where people are claiming they can hear no or little difference in the 2009 remasters from the 1987 version. I think Abbey Road is one of the most beneficial of the new remasters. Paul's bass lines have never sounded more distinct then they do here. This is evedent in the first few seconds of \\"Come Together.\\" Just listen to \\"Something\\" and follow PM's melodic playing. It's absolutely beautiful. The background harmonies on \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" \\"Oh, Darling\\" and \\"Ocopusus's Garden\\" never sounded clearer. The climax of \\"I Want You(She's so heavy\\") is thunderous. The triology of \\"Mean Mister Mustard\\" \\"Polythene Pam\\" and \\"She Came in Through the Bathroom Window\\" is even more stunning then before and \\"The End\\" has a more majestic quality then it did on the previous release. If you're a fan of The Beatles and of this recording then do not hesitate to buy this CD. Aside from the improved sound,the packaging is a real treat. The gatefolds features 2 photos originally used for the American LP  \\"Hey Jude\\" as well as a new shot from the same session. And the booklet is filled with a fab collection of photos and informative historical and recording notes. The Beatles final recording is the crowning jewel of their incredible body of work. And it never sounded better.

B0006B2A2E|5.0|Usually I like to watch comedies as well as action/adventure films, but this particular movie broadened my horizon to films that transcend typical storytelling. The premise is unique and with a 5-star cast, there is no denying a stellar performance. Granted you must watch the movie with an open mind to fully immerse yourself to this world. Don't expect hilarious comedy and action-packed adventure in this film, but do expect that this movie is one-of-a-kind  -steven

Unfortunately grunge rock took over and brought a lost decade of bad music but things fianlly changed and 10, 20, 30 years from now nobody will care about these boring bands out of Washington state, all the while the world is re-discovering what real rock music is. What goes around comes around!!
0385504225|4.0|I agree with those who have said the Da Vinci Code is a nearly impossible act to follow. The Lost Symbol is a good mystery book with more than enough suspense and intrigue. Some think the material is repetitive, but the problem may be that Brown is just not giving himself enough time to devote to his next project because he still wants to hurry up and maximize on the success of the Davinci.
B002S0OBFK|3.0|Paranormal Activity is the perfect example of a film that is shown during Halloween and after its run, no one will remember it. A movie that doesn't stick with you and if you make the effort to go see it, then its just another way to spend Saturday evening.<br />There is nothing special about Paranormal Activity, you have your stupid stock horror character in Micah, played by Micah Sloat, who buys a camera to record strange events occuring at home.  Micah's use of filming his girlfriend Katie, played by Katie Featherston, by annoyingly having the camera right up in her face like an old MTV concert video, gets old quickly. Katie has a lot of patience to put up with be constantly filmed during such mundane activties such as brushing her teeth.  I never understood why Katie didn't punch Micah in the arm and turn off that damn camera.<br />Anyway, the camera is placed in the bedroom to record what happens each night. As can be expected in this type of film, doors shut by themselves, windows lock, lights turn on, footsteps are heard, and strange sounds occur. All elements of any haunted house movie. If you have ever seen one haunted house movie, then you are not really seeing anything different here. Nothing that adds to the genre.<br />A better example of a psychological, character driven Haunted House movie would be Robert Wise's The Haunting (1963) which does cause sleepless nights unlike Paranormal Activity.<br />This movie had a lot of potential to be entertaining or better, actually scary, but it just never gets there like the rollar coaster ride that starts out strong and fizzle out at the end.<br />The hauntings are caused by a demon who follows Katie from place to place and not a ghost bound to one location.  The whimpy psychic, Michael B&uuml;nyamin, makes this point when he shows up to find out why Micah and Katie are being haunted. He claims that he is not a demonologist so he can't really do anything. He's just a character giving information and he's not really effective combating the supernatural because its not really his job. Katie and Micah argue about calling a demonolgist to try to put a stop to demon activites and the demonologist never shows up.<br />That's my main problem with Paranormal Activites, there is no expert sent it to combat and fight the demon. This movie needs a Van Helsing or an Priest trained in exorcism to step in and actually do something about the problem.<br />Micah's lame attempts to fill that position through self education from demonology books and Internet information and trying to confront the demon through talking to it and shouting go nowhere. Micah never tries anything to battle the demon like holy water or any idea that might work. The demon has all the power and does whatever it wants to with Micah and Katie.  There is no specialist who does anything to try to stop it or information presented in the film to aid fighting the demon and forcing it to stop haunting the couple.<br />I won't spoil the ending, I will just say it was the best part of the whole drawn out experience and it probably caused the terrorfied high school kid, sitting in front of me, to wet himself. I haven't seen an auidence member jump like that in a long time.<br />If you have $9 to spend and you want to see something good with intelligent characters this Halloween, then go see Zombieland instead of Paranoraml Activity.<br />I really wish directors working today, would go back and research good horror movies that work and go see horror movies made in the 80's when these films actually worked and were made better.<br />2 and 1/2 stars Average fare.the supernatural because its not really his job.

The supersavers shipping is great as well because for a few dollars more you can get another product instead of paying for SH&H. I live on a Marine Corp base in Japan and not only do they have a smaller selection then what I can find for dvd's especialy Blu-reys. They are so much cheaper here on amazon as well. This product was brand new and works great, plus an excelent movie with a great plot and acting. A must own for any Clint or Thriller fan.

I returned the book it was so bad. I was rather disappointed because I expected better after reading so many good reviews. I have, however, been consistently happy with Isa Chandra Moskowitz' recipes so if you have a sweet tooth, I would suggest one of her books instead, not The Joy of Vegan Baking.

The songs are very well done and very listenable to even someone who is not a huge Dylan fan. I guess the the best thing is that the message is clear. We should follow his lead and help the less fortunate in America and around the world. So buy this album and maybe give a little to.

014241493X|4.0|I'm 21 and an avid reader. Recently, I have been reading the more interesting sounding YA novels that have come out recently, looking for some fun, smart, quick reads. I've read quite a few, and from those I have really enjoyed The Hunger Games and its sequel Catching Fire, Graceling and it's prequel Fire, The Host, Poison Study, A Certain Slant of Light and I'm currently reading and enjoying Maximum Ride. I felt like all of these YA books stood out from the rest because the stories were cleverly developed, the dialog was fun, and they kept me interested. Nor did the writing and dialog feel 'young' or a little silly as some YA novels often feel.     Now on to Paper Towns...    I really enjoyed reading this book, it was fun to read, and I loved the main character and his group of friends. I thought that the story developed well overall. That being said, while the first half of the book was ok (not incredibly entertaining nor boring), what kept me reading was how much I enjoyed getting to know the main character and his two friends Ben and Radar. At first I found their teen boy dialog a little annoying, but after getting to know them a little better it made sense. Quentin's obsession with interpreting Margo got old after awhile and I started to get bored which thankfully didn't last for too long. I was pleasantly surprised when I got to maybe the last 150 pages of the book and it felt like the pages were flying by because I had just completely fallen into the last part of the story! There were parts in this last section of the book that made me laugh out loud and I found the group of friends so endearing in the last part of their journey that I couldn't put it down, not because I really wanted to know what happened at the end, but because it was so enjoyable to read.     After reading Paper Towns, there is no doubt in my mind that John Green is a good writer, and I really admire his ability to tap into the teenage way of thinking and many of the emotions that we are prone to feel during high school. The fact that he is able to make the characters in the book sound like actual teenagers without sounding overly formulated adds to the novel. My only issue with this book is that I felt like the author was trying to make Margo into Holden Caulfield in far too obvious of a way and it made her character and her character's angst seem silly. Her calling Orlando a \\"paper town\\" and then having Quentin rehash the sentiment when he observes 'all the paper people, in the paper houses at their paper party' (or whatever the actual quote said), was just too obviously similar to Holden and his 'phonies'. The difference between Holden and Margo though is that Holden was far more believable in his need to escape from societal norms.     The character of Margo was so off putting to me because her angst seemed so calculated by the author that she didn't feel unique at all and it made the book seem a little trite. The effect she had on Quentin made sense though (and essentially this is what the book is about), and thankfully because he was such a great main character and his friends were fun too, this book is well worth the read.     While this book might lack the entertainment factor of The Hunger Games, I definitely recommend it to readers who like a slightly introspective and fun YA novel where you can connect with the main character. In many of the popular YA books coming out the main characters seem predominately female, so I found Quentin to be a breath of fresh air.     Some of the reviews down here address the language but I definitely feel that it's far from offensive in this book because it's realistic to how high school students speak. For concerned parents, I think there might have been a few sex references, but nothing strong.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I'm a long time endurance athlete (mountain biking, trail running, adventure races), but I'm also a big guy (like the author) for whom running was usually a chore.  I trained because it was a necessity to compete, not because I really enjoyed it. This book changed all that, and inspired me to treat running as fun, freeing, and something I can do into old age.
B002AF4Y96|5.0|What can I say about this movie that hundreds have all ready said? Here's my own personal thoughts on Oliver Stone's under appreciated violent opus. One, from what I heard Oliver Stone and Don Murphy made some changes to Quentin Tarantino's original script, and Tarantino never really liked this movie, from what I have read.<br /><br />Over all, this movie assaults the senses, some nice cinema photography, music was cool from opening credits to ending. We all know what Stone was trying to convey, Media glorifying violence, violence sells, violence in media brings in viewers, people like Mickey and Mallory are socially violent miscreants, exploited by a one savvy, weasel reporter portrayed nicely by Robert Downey Jr. I enjoy this movie because of the performances, especially by one Tommy Lee Jones, WOW when I saw this when I was 15 and watching Lee's performance as the warden I was blown away, just so unhinged and over the top I loved it!<br /><br />I felt along the way Stone's message get's muddled, because us as the viewers get assaulted with all this imagery, we forget what he is trying to convey, what he is trying to get across to the viewer. Correct me if I am wrong, this has to be one of the first movies to mix an animated sequence in it, I know there is Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and Cool World and some others but as a medium in the film, a scene shot as a dream sequence, having Comic book look for that one particular scene to heighten the imagery and style I thought was very cool when I had first seen it, then fast forward, Kill Bill, Tarantino does a whole scene in Anime to show O- Ren Ishi's past.<br /><br />Over all a nice packaged Blu Ray edition with a new intro by Stone, new featurette to go along with this edition. If you're a Stone fan, or Woody, Tommy Lee Jones, check out this movie.
B001GCUNYO|4.0|So I didn't check this one out in theaters, but heard some cool positive reviews from people. This is a darn good action thriller, ok so plot of formulaic, simple, nothing new in this sort of genre. What is the main focal point is Liam Neeson's performance, he is a man hell bent to get his daughter back, hell, if this movie was made 10 --- 15 years ago guess who be in Neeson's role, I bet Harrison Ford, come on when watching this movie all I kept thinking was Harrison Ford could be interchangeable with Liam. But no Liam brought a nice presence to what could of been another bland revenge thriller, this might not be quite on par with Man on Fire, but it's pretty close, violence toned down for PG13, but still effective, you root when a baddie get's the s@#$ beat out of him by Liam, you're rooting for Liam, again what drives this movie is the performance of the Lead Actor. Over all a very good movie, briskly paced, nice score, action sequences very cool. Worth checking out.

B002HWRYJE|1.0|This \\"Star Trek\\" movie (if you can call it Star Trek) and the last two that were made are the worst Star Trek movies ever. The Nokia product placement was shameful. And for those who think I'm too anal, would you have liked to have seen Anakin Skywalker walk on the screen with a Pepsi and a bucket of KFC? The worst part is that the main plot of the story (revenge for a lost love) is a complete rip off of the best Star Trek movie of all time \\"The Wrath of Khan\\". The disappointment and copout of the film is that the timeline is altered and yet we are suppose to believe that these characters will still serve together on the same ship and will be best friends forever! Ummm, not believable. Not only is the timeline altered by two premature deaths, but now there are black holes that alter the Star Trek universe for the worse! I seriously doubt that Gene Roddenberry would have been happy with this deterioration of his vision!
B000VDDWDS|5.0|Excellent Napoleonic seafaring tale recounting the lone pursuit by HMS Surprise of the French warship Acheron set in 1805 in the South Atlantic and Pacific. The acting performances are top level throughout whether we're talking about Russell Crowe's Captain Aubrey of the Surprise or any of the other shipboard mates and midshipmen. The movie provides close-up and brutal battle action featuring 18-inch guns and on-board swashbuckling scuffles that take the fight right into your 5.1 surround home theater room.     Highlights of this atmospheric film include the opening battle with the Acheron, sailing through a dangerous storm at Cape Horn with enormous waves thrusting at the ship, an all too brief visit by the ship's naturalist to the Galapagos to check out the animal life, musical duet by Crowe and ship's surgeon Paul Bettany, and the final encounter and victory over the Acheron.     In between we get a realistic look at daily shipboard life and the usual protocol and conflicts between midshipmen and the crew and the captain. While impatient viewers may lust for more intense action here, these scenes do everything to make the story all the more realistic. This is the kind of film that becomes even more appreciated on repeated viewings.     The Blu-ray production is mostly first-rate including ship detail, uniforms, facial features, and even the texture of paper on written letters and seacharts. It did seem like some initial terrain scenes in the Galapogos were far less than 1080 lines.     Special Features. Fox previews are here where they belong. The Map feature allows you to press Enter anytime to display a map in the lower corner which indicates the current position of the HMS Surprise.    Deleted scenes - Many of these should have been left in the release: A guy getting his tooth pulled the old-fashioned way is quite humorous as is that of the lad getting tattoed with the basic ink and needle method. Scenes of the Surprise cruising in the open ocean and especially those on the Galapagos where the scene with the tortoses is expanded and the blue-footed booby is examined. These scenes may have added another 15 minutes but would have been worthwhile (future Director's release of course). The deleted scenes are only DVD quality.
B0017I1FNK|4.0|Emmylou Harris could - to paraphrase an overworked comment - sing the phonebook and she could make me sad. On her 2008 \\"All I Intended to Be,\\" she digs in deep and follows a mournful track that is just pure Emmylou, teaming up with old collaborators like the McGarrigle sisters and her ex-husband/early producer Brian Ahern to make a fantastic album.<br /><br />As the pure country strains of \\"Shores of White Sand\\" give way to a lilting Celtic flute, you realize Emmylou has moved away from the Daniel Lanois atmospherics of the lovely [[ASIN:B00004WZOJ Red Dirt Girl]] and back to the openness of traditional country. \\"All I Intended To Be\\" stays the course with a mixture of Emmylou's original songs and a choice selection of covers from Merle Haggard, Patty Griffin and Tracy Chapman. Chapman's \\"All You Have Is Your Soul\\" (from her [[ASIN:B000002H7I Crossroads]]) is one of the album's highlights.<br /><br />But for me, the clincher is Harris's own \\"Gold.\\" Here, she invites Vince Gill and old [[ASIN:B000002LAC Trio]] companion Dolly Parton to sing harmonies. The result is sublimely beautiful (and makes me wish for a return of the \\"Trio\\" for a third album). It's my favorite song on an album that surrounds the soul-pulling of sadness with strains of hope, and rates up among Emmylou Harris' best CD's.
B000Q6GX5Y|4.0|300 / B000Q6GX5Y<br /><br />*Spoilers*<br /><br />As a spectacle fighting movie, \\"300\\" is a joy to behold. The fighting sequences are beautifully choreographed, and the camera work is superb. Special effects merge flawlessly with the rest of the action, and it is a delight to see what a big budget and talented cast can produce when they put their minds to it. Even the soundtrack and soothing narrative overlay are gorgeous, combining to make the frequent and varied battle scenes a feast for the eyes and ears. And the stunning visual effects aren't limited to the battleground; the much-hyped Oracle scene is as lovely in film as it was on the promotional posters, and the visions of Xerxes and his entourage are lovely, if historically unrealistic (more on that later). Even the writing for the Spartan warriors is nicely done; the humorous quips on the battlefield are clever and help to relieve the overall tension.<br /><br />This isn't to say \\"300\\" is for everyone - if visual effects aren't your thing and spectacle fighting doesn't interest you, this movie likely won't hold your interest. There is a story, but it's definitely the weakest point of \\"300\\" - the jingoistic, oh-aren't-I-a-clever-writer dialogue for the Spartan queen in particular will grate on anyone's nerves, with flat lines like \\"Freedom isn't free\\" spoken with such overdone fervor and determination that it feels she's stepped directly out of [[ASIN:B0007Y08IS Team America]].<br /><br />And it's important to note that \\"300\\" isn't even remotely historically accurate - not that it needs to be, but sometimes the movie seems to think that we should think that, which is just odd. Spartans shouldn't be talking about \\"freedom\\" and \\"free men\\" as if they were present-day Americans; Sparta was a slave-holding society without shame, so why this unnecessary \\"freedom\\" subtext? Can't we just have a nice spectacle fighting movie about defending one's borders from an invading power without needing to make the whole thing 'relevant' to modern day events? It almost feels like the movie is embarrassed of itself and wants to tag on a \\"deep\\" subtext as an excuse for all this artistic fighting, but the \\"deep\\" material just distracts, unlike the subtext in [[ASIN:B000NU2CY4 Gladiator]] which I felt served an actual point.<br /><br />As a final note, having owned both the Blu-ray and the regular version of this movie, I don't particularly feel that the Blu-ray version is worth shelling out the extra money. The transfer isn't the best (there are many scenes that are still very grainy), and this isn't really the best movie to showcase Blu-ray abilities anyway, since the visual effects are deliberately kind of washed and grainy to begin with. I'd definitely recommend buying this movie, as it's definitely worthy of a spot on the shelf, but I'd buy the regular DVD over the Blu-ray version.<br /><br />~ Ana MardollIt almost feels like the movie is embarrassed of itself and wants to tag on a \\"deep\\" subtext as an excuse for all this artistic fighting, but the \\"deep\\" material just distracts, unlike the subtext in [[ASIN:B000NU2CY4 Gladiator]] which I felt served an actual point.

B002K0WBY6|5.0|You know, I LOVE this movie.  I saw it 5 times in theaters, and would have seen it an additional two times, had the timing not been so bad.  However, my husband purchased this dvd for me, and I'm seriously upset at the features.  I enjoyed the \\"Set Antics,\\" but I know there were more outtakes than that and I would have loved to have seen them.  I enjoyed the commentary, but I would have LOVED to have seen/heard one with Sandra and Ryan.  I've listened to various other commentaries they have each done, and I was SO looking forward to hearing them both together.  I am severely disappointed that they did not do a commentary and that there were not more outtakes, etc.    I'm glad they included the alternate ending, but I'm so happy they went with the ending that they did.  The one that was seen in theaters was infinitely better than the one at the airport.     I still love this movie.  It's by far my favorite romance, and I don't like rom-coms.  Sandra and Ryan are probably my favorite actors and to see them work SO well together, was amazing.  Love it.

B0029358GM|4.0|Just when I thought it couldn't get any better than Sky Blue Sky, the lads from the windy city produce yet again!  Complex cord changes throughout and progressive lyrics make this record a must for any alternative rock fan.  From the dark and twisted \\"I'll Fight\\" to the perky \\"Sonny Feeling\\", I found this record very relaxing, yet rockin at the same time!
0316069906|5.0|The buzz about this book was so incredible I had to get my hands on an advanced copy. The book is like nothing else ever written on the food industry. It reads like a novel, is funny, incredibly well documented, and lets factory farmers and animal activists speak in their own words. I've read a lot of books on the food industry and this is by far the best. It makes other writers, even Michael Pollan, look a bit timid. Foer never preaches. He shares his own beliefs and asks us to live by our own standards, not his. Foer reveals a lot of personal information here and, since this is his first nonfiction book, it its especially interesting for readers of his previous books to see some of the fact behind his fiction.  The material about his grandmother and how she survived the holocaust is really powerful. The stuff about his dog George (Foer makes a mock case for eating dogs) is hilarious. His storytelling is so compelling that you hardly realize how much information he's conveying (there are 60 pages of notes documenting his sources, but the text itself is uncluttered by footnotes). Another unique thing about this book is that Foer actually sneaks into a factory farm in the middle of the night... Eating Animals is a serious book that could change the way you live. But what's most impressive about it is that it is also fun to read, which is exactly what we need on a hot button topic like the contemporary food industry.
0547258305|4.0|The moment I started reading Graceling it was very difficult to stop. Kristin Cashore immediately captures the reader's attention with an action scene of Katsa's rescue of a Lienid prince. Interesting, in the same chapter she meets Prince Po, a mysterious, yet alluring, stranger to Katsa, whom she immediately feels a certain magnetism.<br /><br />From then on each page was filled with action sequences that describe Katsa's Grace, which I found rather fascinating and unique. Whereas one can assume a person born with Grace is highly regarded, this is not the case with environment of Katsa's upbringing. Among the seven kingdoms, only one considered the Graced with respect and admiration. The others look down upon it as a minion for the Kings to command. Because of this perception among the Gracelings, the author reveals moments in Katsa's actions and thoughts how this protagonist developed a character of fear, scorn, insecurity, and mistrust over anyone she meets, except for her cousin, her hand maiden, and the King's chief of security. The novel is centered on a story of  Katsa's struggle to overcome all these inner demons, accept her gift without admonition, and gain ultimate freedom  to decide in her own terms how to use her Grace.<br /><br />However, there are shortcomings in the story, particularly towards the final chapters, that can leave a reader feeling rather baffled. The antagonist King Leck lacks further characterization and narration. His introduction in middle of the story is intriguing and captivates the audience with success. What a perfect enemy whom Katsa and Prince Po even fears. However, the author falls short of explaining King Leck's history and the reason for his treachery. Is the legend of his past true? Where did he come from? Why does he torture children and animals? Why does it appear Bitterblue, his only child can block his evil Grace, when she is in fact not a Graceling? There are so many questions surrounding this character that were left unanswered. However, I read in Ms. Cashore's website that the novels, Fire, and Butterblue (prequel and sequel to Graceling) will answer the mystery surrounding King Leck.<br /><br />With regards to the tragedy that happened to Prince Po, one might wonder if this was necessary. I have mixed feelings about this as well, however, I do understand that his doleful fate could be the character's catharsis, wherein Prince Po also begins to accept and fully utilize the power of his Grace. Furthermore, this is a showing of a true unconditional love between the prince and the heroine.<br /><br />For those who love young adult fantasy I am positive you will like Graceling.

0765322889|4.0|I love books like this one.  It was a little difficult to keep track of all of the characters, but you'll get the hang of it before the end.  The setup is immense.  The scale is grand.  If you like Robert Jordan's WoT, you'll like this.  It is much more complex.  It has a much more intricate and interesting story.  You can't just root for one side.  They're human.  No one is perfect in this story.
B000I0QKDS|4.0|I can't believe that I or my friends weren't listening to this back in the 70s. Well, I think I have an idea.<br /><br />First, I am very impressed by this music, and I'm not all that knowledgeable about \\"its place in rock history.\\" Truthfully, I could care less about things like that. This is just plain great heavy blues rock that pre-dates Led Zeppelin. Jimmy Page must have based his vision for Led Zeppelin on this LP. Of course, if we are mindful of our rock history, Beck's group disintegrated about the same time Pagey's group was introduced. And the rest is indeed history. And that is why my friends and I were totally unaware of this great music, but we weren't unaware of Jeff Beck. Zep were a working band releasing new music. Jeff Beck had turned to fusion by the time we were in high school. And yes, I did own both Blow By Blow and Wired in the 70s, and my friends did too, and I have both on CD at home, and I listen to both occasionally. So again, I have to wonder, how did we miss this? If we had, I'm sorry to say that in our teenage ignorance we would have accused Beck of trying to imitate Led Zeppelin, when in fact, it was the other way around!!<br /><br />Beck even did the blues right. Most of the songs on the LP are covers, yet unlike Page, Beck actually gives credit to the originals. Page just rearranged the songs, stole some lyrics, and put his name on them. According to the liner notes, Beck even asked Howlin' Wolf for permission to re-arrange I Ain't Superstitious. That proves the amount of respect Beck had for his influences.<br /><br />If you are a fan of British blues-based heavy metal, there really is no excuse for you not to hear this. Now that I have, I am forced to rethink some of my assumptions about Led Zeppelin.
0618918248|5.0|This is excellent for the atheist. I don't know whether it is a good book to introduce to religious people who are not used to questioning their faith because Dawkins sometimes comes off as too harsh. Yet, if you were an atheist or skeptic or just someone who is comfortable with questioning your faith, you would not find him crazy fanatical. It would be a comprehensive coverage of many aspects of what is essential to dealing with religion. He is funny at times but that's where I worry. Atheists will see it as genuinely funny. Religious people might be turned off instantly by the mocking tone and not appreciating the actual argument. He divides the book into neat chapters and go straight to the point. I believe this is what makes him effective.    Now if you are a Christian, a lot with lie with your faith that the bible is inerrant. Or you may think some are literal, some metaphorical, and that it's alright. Or lastly, you may not really know what you know about the bible as most Christians do. This book is not for you yet because it touches too briefly on these. Instead, read up any bible textual criticism works such as the popular ones by Bart Ehrman.    The book itself:    If you are a Christian, you will know that there are old scholars with their arguments for God/Christianity just as you will know there was a Plato even if you never read it. Dawkins deals with the famous arguments and goes straight to the point why they don't work. More recent arguments for Creationism/Intelligent Design are dealt with. Other methods Christians use to debate, such as design, authority...etc are dealt with.    What else do you rely on if not intellectual arguments? The bible of course. He discusses this as well.    Say you are convinced to incline toward atheism. The next question is, without God, where is morality? This is the natural next question that is commonly asked, as Dostoevsky also talked about in \\"brothers karamazov\\". he discusses this.    and then the rest is info onproblems with religion being in the world with him discussing some of his concerns such as childhood indoctrination and such.    You can read any of his chapters independently and they are effective. That's what makes this book well maped out and a good read.

B000ZECQ08|1.0|The movie jumps from one scene to another and has no real flow. It also seems like an episode of One Tree Hill or some other lame hook up TV show. I have liked all of the Potter movies up until this one. However, this one is just boring and I wanted to leave the theater the whole time. I will not see the next one at a movie theater.

1591841666|4.0|This is the 1st book that I've read by Seth Godin and find his writing is refreshing. The Dip is about telling you when to move in (stick) or when to move out (quit). It is refreshing as most of the time you never encouter anyone to tell you to quit but to continue to fight it. However, Seth Godin will not only teach you to quit but also when you should do it. I really enjoy reading The Dip and I hope you will find it interesting too.
044024367X|3.0|[[ASIN:0615318207 Blood Moon: Thrillers and Tales of Terror]]<br /><br />\\"Nothing to Lose\\" is not one of Lee Child's best books featuring his hero Reacher.  The first two hundred-odd pages plod along as Reacher goes back and forth between two towns with the patently allegorical names of Hope and Despair.  Meanwhile, there is very little in the way of plot development to propel the story.<br /><br />That being said, I have to admit I like the ending, and midway through the novel the pace does pick up satisfactorily.<br /><br />I found the villain to be an interesting character, and ultimately, I do like the complex, if at times bewildering, plot of this thriller.  If only it hadn't taken so long for it to play out!<br /><br />--Bryan Cassiday, author of \\"Blood Moon\\" and \\"Fete of Death\\"

0061914177|5.0|I've followed Gary for a long time and what makes him magnetic is his passion, which is what this book is all about above anything else. After identifying your passion, he gives you the tools and strategies to use them to take that passion to the world and make money with it.  If you've watched any of Gary's videos, you can really hear him narrating the entire book in your mind, so you can tell he put his heart and soul in it.  The tools in this book have helped put some structure around efforts I was already trying.  A great read!  I recommend it to anyone looking to capitalize on social media for something more out of life.
0810983915|3.0|The previous 3 Wimpy Kid books were laugh-out-loud funny throughout the entire books.  That's what I was hoping for in this volume, but didn't get.  I don't find constant whining and complaining to be funny.<br /><br />The first 75 pages are written by a waste of a kid complaining about summer vacation, and nothing truly funny starts to happen until after that point.  The middle 1/3 of the book is the best, and I found myself laughing aloud frequently. Unfortunately, the last part of the book finds Gregory resuming his whining, and the humor faded.<br /><br />Overall, this was mediocre, and not up to the standards of the series.
0385504225|4.0|If you're looking for Dan Brown, you'll find him in his latest book, the Lost Symbol.  I enjoy reading books for the worlds they create, stepping into early 1900's Cornwall, I'll opt for a Morton or Austen book; looking for legal intrigue I'll pick up Grisham; in the mood for a magical adventure, J.K. Rowling or Johnathon Stroud.  Finally, for symbolism and intrigue, Dan Brown's my guy.  The Lost Symbol pulled me in and kept me focused from start to finish.  I'm always looking for an interesting journey in reading and never a swash buckling end.  I purchase a book to fulfill me at every turn of the page.  Each time I picked up the Lost Symbol I was transported and entertained - difficult to do when you only have a few minutes here or there to read.  Some say the latter half of the book is a bit dry - I have to disagree, albeit the latter half is more enjoyable when you have a quiet space to mull over the discussions of science and religion.

B002MW50KY|5.0|When I first heard of this album coming out I thought of the group that meets downtown Seattle each year to sing Christmas carols in their best Robert Zimmerman impression. This is nothing like it, this is really good, and it truly is a work of an artist, not just another singer doing a Christmas LP. The recording has a 50's/60's recording style to it with the background vocals. Well worth the investment, and special thanks to Bob for doing a charity album. Buy some old Christmas wish books on e-bay, turn on the gas fireplace, and turn on the tree lights, and listen, and remember mom, dad, and family when things were special and they were magical. Bob is the new Tennessee Ernie Ford:)    Keith Johnson  E-learning Specialist, Seattle
0385341008|5.0|I read this book aloud to my mother when she was recovering from hip replacement surgery.  We both loved it.  We laughed; we cried; we raised our eyebrows and we shook our heads.  We entirely lost track of our surroundings and were blissfully transported to the British Isles during the 1940s.  As a bonus, the format (a series of short letters among the book's various characters) allowed us to readily put the book aside and pick it up again when naps, meals or therapies required a rude return to the present.  It's a great read if you're healthy, too, but it's now routinely joining the flowers I send to any friends who are bed-bound.
0385504225|5.0|The Lost Symbol was absolutely incredible. Dan Brown has the ability to create, mystery, suspense and history in his novels, a perfect combination.

B0029O08WA|4.0|I listened to the tracks on the New Moon MySpace page and I was not impressed by any other than 'The Meadow.'  But, when I saw the great download price Amazon offered I couldn't wait for the Score to come out so I got it.  This is a very unique soundtrack, especially when compared to 'Twilight' (which I love!!!).  I have listened to it countless times since Friday and I am pleased to say these songs are really growing on me.  I like them, they are great background music for studying, driving, working...  I even sing along to bits!  I'd say give it a shot if you have any varied taste in music.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|I've loved the bagpipe rendition of \\"Amazing Grace\\" for so long that I knew that I had to watch this film. The life of William Wilberforce during the 15-year struggle to end the slave trade in England was quite poignant and emotional, especially at the time when the parliament finally approves this hard-fought legislation. Michael Gambon's speech in commemoration to Wilberforce (in attendance at the time) was especially emotional for me. Of course, what could be better then ending with \\"Amazing Grace\\" played by the piper of the Black Watch?

B000024B0E|5.0|This in one of my top 5 favorite albums and definitely one that, in my opinion, is worth a try even if you're not a hard-core ambient or psychedelic fan. It's not very accessible, so if you're looking for pop music you might not like it, but if you want to listen to a really challenging, emotional, and engrossing album, there's a lot to discover here. And if you are an electronica fan - it's an essential album
1582701709|5.0|This book came highly recommended to me from a 23 year old man.  He is a reader of many books and found this book exceptional.  It took me forever to find the book.

0385504225|3.0|The Lost Symbol was fun to read.  I had always wanted to know more about the Mason's, and I have not had much time in DC.  So, I think I learned a little bit about both, and found myself doing some online research as I read along.    The story is OK, suspenseful, and sufficiently scary to keep your interest.  If there is to be a movie, they will need someone like A Hopkins to portray the Lecter like character of intelligent evil.    Will this book change your life?  Not likely.  Is it a quick fun read?  Yes.

B000007638|5.0|There's a different feel with McCartney in the 70s versus McCartney of today.  Then, the Beatles break-up scars were still very fresh when McCartney hit the road in '75-'76.  He had managed and succeeded to start a new life with John, George and Ringo but compared to his fellow bandmates starting in 1970, he really needed to prove himself who he was.  Ringo in the early 70s really bursted out on the music scene, George was phenomenal with All Things Must Pass and Bangldesh and John's first post Beatles solo album is a major musical breakthrough and who can forget Imagine?  McCartney's first solo album was masterful and Ram was also a great album and Wing's first album went nowhere, Red Rose Speedway was a major step-up and Band On The Run was and still is a masterpiece.  I remember the reviews of Venus and Mars and many critics were like...not bad.    The tour of all tours in the 70s was Wings Over America...along with Linda and Denny Laine, Macca put together and amazing rock band and what a grand slam he hit with this tour and album...the movie Rock Show is just an amazing live show, the faces in the crowd as they see Macca post-Beatles on-stage, breathtaking.

B002JTMNX2|5.0|I've been into Foreigner since the first album. I've even seen the original Foreigner in concert with Lou Gramm. On Friday, October 16, 2009 I had the pleasure of seeing the new line up at Bergen Pac in New Jersey. I have to say, I was very amazed by how the new line up had more \\"PUNCH\\" to them! The show was 100% pure Rockin Foreigner. The new CD \\"Can't Slow Down\\" truly stands up to the older Foreigner CD's/Albums. It's a great deal. You get the new album, hits remixed, and a live dvd. It will certainly satisfy the older and newer listeners of Foreigner. It's also great to see the band is still on Atlantic Records through Rhino/Warner Bros. They've truly done a lot for Atlantic Records since they signed with them. I remember when Foreigner performed at The Atlantic Records Anniversary at Madison Square Garden. When I first put the new CD in my player, I totally had an open mind about it, and really wanted to see what the new line up could do. Well, without a doubt this band is not a Foreigner tribute band. Mick Jones truly went back to the drawing board and recrerated a great Rock Band that will be around for a long time.
B00006CXXU|4.0|I don't think many people were ready for `Stripped' when it was released.  When you think about where Christina Aguilera came from I can understand why, but even on her teeny-bop pop-princess debut she showed a rare talent for the genre, proving that she had a vocal range unknown to the rest of her pop-mates.  Listen to `Blessed' and you'll understand what I'm referring to.  So, on `Stripped' she takes that promise and blows it out of the water.<br /><br />Sadly, there is too much filler here to justify the 5-star rating I wanted to give it.<br /><br />When Christina hits, she hits marvelously.  I'm a little irritated that she felt the need to stuff her sophomore album with 20 tracks.  There was no need, for if it had only been shortened by maybe 5 then she would have had a near-perfect album that could go down as one of the best pop albums of all time.  In fact, tracks like `Walk Away', `Fighter' and `Beautiful' are some of the best pop songs off all time.  But, with all the good there is ample mediocre here.<br /><br />A little trimming would have really done this album some good.<br /><br />I'm going to get the interlude tracks out of the way first, since they don't really count.  The `Stripped Parts 1 & 2' are decent, although I would have CLOSED the album with `Part 2' and not stuck it in at track number 17.  I particularly like the flow of `Part 2'.  The interlude for `Infatuation' is leagues better than the actual song, and the interlude for `Loving Me 4 Me' doesn't just sound like it belongs on a Mariah Carey album, it sounds like Mariah Carey sung it.<br /><br />Speaking of Mariah Carey, best track on the album is BY FAR `Walk Away', which is Christina's `Mariah Moment', where she embodies everything that made `My All' Mariah's greatest moment ever.  It is flawless, beautiful, intoxicating, elegant; and that bridge with the escalating \\"oh\\" is just all types of mind-blowing awesomeness.<br /><br />But I really wanted to get the bad out of the way first, so I'm going to start with `Infatuation'.  The song is not `bad' in the true sense of the word; it is just merely `ok'.  It has nothing special to it.  The flow is there, but it is generic pop/dance music with some cool accent work by Aguilera, but she is much more effectively seductive on the interlude.  `Cruz' and `Soar' are worse songs in there simplistic (meaning BORING) delivery.  There is just nothing to care about with these tracks.<br /><br />Songs like `Impossible' and `Underappreciated' are not stellar, but they are at least entertaining, even if I won't remember them enough to select them to listen to.  Sure, I'll listen when they come on (I refuse to listen to `Cruz' or `Soar') but I won't seek them out.  `Can't Hold Us Down' was one of the first singles off the album, and it is an instant hit.  It has not aged as well for me, and it has its flaws (it is very cookie-cutter sounding despite the vulgarities) but it is still a good song and a fun one to listen to.  Besides, it has Lil' Kim, and I love her.  `Make Over' is a really nice change of pace, and despite the fact that she sounds forced in parts, it is a nice stretch for Christina.  I like the rock edge she plays with here, although she fares much better on `Fighter'.<br /><br />And then we have the AMAZING, or as I like to call it, the rest of the album.<br /><br />At the bottom of the `perfect' list is `Singing My Song', a great track that is overly long and feels it towards the end; but for what it's worth, she sings it impeccably.  Next is `Dirrty'.  I love this track in all its tacky worthlessness and completely stand by my calling it perfection, because it is SO MUCH FUN.  `Get Mine, Get Yours' is also a lot of fun, much more sensually stimulating than `Infatuation' and just all around noteworthy, even if it is pure pop.  `Loving Me 4 Me' is simple, beautiful and moving, and `The Voice Within' is a powerhouse if I ever heard one.  Talk about spine-tingling vocals.  `Beautiful' and `I'm OK' are thetwo most emotionally absorbed tracks on the album, and `Beautiful' just slightly edges out the other because of its universal impact.  Both are beautiful and frightfully sincere, especially `I'm OK', which could be labeled `recorded misery'.  `Fighter' was one of those songs that I just didn't like when it was released.  Since I've decided to revisit the album though, I've discovered that it is utterly delicious and one of the best pop tracks I've ever heard.<br /><br />That said, nothing can even come close to the marvelous `Walk Away'.<br /><br />So there you have it.  This is a pretty solid sophomore album that I would have limited to 12 tracks it if were up to me (and those interludes, because they jazz up the album a bit).  For those of you with A.D.D. (embrace it, I have), I decided to go ahead and list the tracks in order from favorites to not-so-favorites (including the interludes); for quick reference.<br /><br />1) Walk Away<br />2) Fighter<br />3) Beautiful<br />4) I'm OK<br />5) The Voice Within<br />6) Primer Amor (Infatuation Interlude)<br />7) Loving Me 4 Me<br />8) Stripped Part 2 (Interlude)<br />9) Get Mine, Get Yours<br />10) Dirrty<br />11) Stripped Intro (Interlude)<br />12) Singing My Song<br />13) Make Over<br />14) Can't Hold Us Down<br />15) Loves Embrace (Loving Me 4 Me Interlude)<br />16) Underappreciated<br />17) Impossible<br />18) Infatuation<br />19) Soar<br />20) Cruzst slightly edges out the other because of its universal impact.

B0024F08RO|5.0|The final chapter in the Prison Break saga is not as good as the other seasons. However, you are still kept captivated by the story line and the relationships between the cast members. Tea Bag who you love and hate. Michael who love. All cast members did a great job. Fox did a good job of tying up all the ends. A must have!
B0007OY2P8|5.0|I had just finished reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" and \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" and enjoyed them both very much. I have the recent production of \\"Sense and Sensibility\\"  on DVD. As much as I enjoyed the video I enjoyed the book much more. After reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" I wanted a DVD that stuck as close to the book as possible. This BBC version on video fulfilled my wishes very well. Its not a glamorous, spectaular, Hollywood movie. It's more like watching a play on video. But I enjoyed it because it was just what I wanted. A very close reproduction of the book. If you want a Hollywood production don't buy this DVD. But, If you want the book on video you will not be disappointed.
0385504225|5.0|I mailed this book to my son, he enjoyed it so much that he brought it to Texas for a visit and 3 other people read it. Stated it was one of the best books he has read.

B001R88C6I|5.0|I originaly saw this movie on TV;  so much one of my favorites. After I began collecting DVDs, I spent several years trying to find it. I came up with some interesting movies.  Most people thought I was referring to \\"The Matrix.\\"  The problem was I could not remember the title.  When I found that the movie came from a novel, I, of course, read it; \\"Simulacron 3.\\" I love the premise.  There is a short TV series of this story around someplace.  I'd sure love to get my hands on it.  Anyone know where I can find the series?  GEM

Her program is tough, but short.  My 2 year old even tries to do the video with me!  It's a tough workout, but it's a great workout!  I just started and Im still on level one, but I have already lost 8 lbs!  I highly recomend this video...thanks jillian!
014241493X|5.0|I know this is a YA book, but as a reader who is twice as old as Quentin (okay I lie- I'm about six years older even than that!), I thought it was one of my best reads in a long while.  Having been a band nerd and heavily involved in speech and drama, I most definitely had close friends who were Quentins, Bens, or Radars, and I can think of more than one Margo in my high school (and each of them was about ten tiers higher in the caste system than I, so I cannot say we were close friends).<br /><br />This past week I went to a conference in Phoenix and got stuck in the Albuquerque airport for a couple of hours on my way there.  I saw Paper Towns most unattainably sitting on the top shelf out of arms reach in the airport bookstore.  Thankfully a kind, tall stranger retrieved it for me, and I am so glad he did, because getting to know Quentin a little better at the end of each conference day was more fun than the alternative activity- which would have been getting buzzed in the fancy hotel bar paying $10 per drink.<br /><br />On my return flight I was sitting next to a guy who made this repulsive sound every two to three minutes that made me think he was trying to suck his sinuses down his throat (I can only assure you that reading about this sound is much less nauseating than listening to it).  When I had about twenty pages left, I decided the finale was too special to read in an environment of a full flight on a Sunday evening sitting next to Phlegm-Man, so I saved it until I got home.  No spoilers, but I like how John Green wrapped it up; although I was swimming in metaphors (mainly about grass and cracks-- not what you're thinking).<br /><br />I hope that when they make this into a movie that they don't add extra scenes about Margo that aren't in the book to make the movie more about her than the book is (and this book really needs to be made into a movie).  In my life the Quentins, Bens, Radars, and Laceys are more important to me than the Margos; although I understand why Quentin cared about her.  I still care about the Margos, but despite what Whitman says, I can't feel like I am a part of the same root system with them.  That window/mirror statement says more about me than them (just read the book, and this won't sound so schizo).  Yet at the same time, even though I believe in a life rightly lived and even though I believe the future deserves our faith, there are glimpses through cracks into Margo that make me identify with her.<br /><br />This book was good enough that I am still \\"thinking in John Green\\".  A little John Green narrator is sitting on my shoulder saying thinks like \\"asshat\\".  The book was good enough that even though I have a big presentation at work on Friday, and even though my annual credentialing packet that was due last week sits unfinished on my desk, and even though I should be reviewing all the stuff I learned at my conference, I am writing a book review on Amazon (and I haven't done a review in five years).  I am the mom to three elementary school boys, and I am doing what I can to prevent them from becoming a Chuck Parson- which would be highly unlikely.  The nerd gene that they got from their mom is quite dominant (and as much as I have tried in my life to reverse that part of my genetics- there is no gene therapy for nerdfightosis).  I'm pretty sure they're nerds (albeit of the \\"cool\\" variety)... and that makes me smile.about her.

0316017922|5.0|I have heard everybody and his brother talking about this book and most talk about the \\"10,000 hour rule\\" which states that anybody can be a worldclass expert with 10,000 hours of focused work.  While this may be true, the book is hardly that simply.  There are many reasons people become successful and this book goes into great detail about several of them.    Why do some airlines crash more planes than others?  Why are most great hockey players born in a certain month?    These are just a couple of the questions the author asks and the answers may surprise you.    This is one of the better books I've read this year.  Interesting and thought provoking.
B0010X745K|4.0|For me, I really am not interested in Stephen King novels or movies based on them, but I dug this one.     Based on the 1980's tale, a New England town is enveloped by terror and confusion when a bizarre mist covers everything. Inside are bizarre creatures and a group of people taking refuge in a supermarket have to figure everything out and survive. Is this the end of the world or a phenomena caused by a military experiment gone wrong -- or on purpose? It's not just about the monsters in the mist. It's mainly about the people and what can happen when they are scared and losing their composure.     There was too much Mrs. Carmody, though, the lady who believes that she's a vessel of God and that she knows all the answers. She's got it all wrong, especially when she is speaking to God and saying that she wants to \\"earn\\" her place at His side by works she does. As the Bible states, it is not of works so nobody can boast and claim \\"I got here but what I did.\\" It's Jesus' sacrifice that was the only acceptable payment for sin. It's grace; something we didn't deserve.     Even commentary on a deleted scene mentioned that they cut out more featuring her because people \\"got her\\" and didn't need as much.     The special effects were reasonable with the limited budget. The worst were the tentacles in the loading dock, which just seemed unfinished in some way. I liked the great Frances Sternhagen killing that giant bug with the spray and a flame; check out her doing it in the special effects.     I thought the ending was just awesome. The father killed his son and the three other passengers rather than let them face death from the monsters. Then, he stepped out into the mist, calling for the monsters to get him. However, the mist started to dissipate and military vehicles all came into view...along with rescued people.     I wonder what I would have thought if the trucks with saved folks contained all those who were left behind in the supermarket? I think that might have madeit even cooler.     The father did keep his promise to his son, who asked him to never let the monsters get him...but it was in a horrible way, ultimately, since if he just waited a couple more minutes everyone would have been fine and his promise would still have been kept, of course.     With everything witnessed ... especially the absolutely huge monster at the end ... they all must have thought the mist was unending and they just gave up. I think I would have wanted to wait until I was starving or the monsters were right outside the window.     Still, it was good to see something different in a movie; a depressing but awesome finale; and Mr. King approved of it and that's good to know.     4 stars from me.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Spirited Away is an AMAZING movie, straight from a brilliant imagination. The art is beautiful, the story is captivating, and the characters feel like they are a part of you. Appropriate for any and all ages, kids to adults. If you haven't seen this movie, save yourself the rental fee and just buy it; if you have seen it, then you were probably going to buy it regardless of my review, so either way, BUY IT!!!
B001TH7GT6|5.0|I was in need of video cables for mi kid's HDTV, it is a small 15\\" HD set connected to a DVD he uses to watch his movies.<br /><br />You can tell these are quality cables just by looking at them, they are gold plated (they are supposed to deliver with better quality) and color coded so you can easily tell which cable goes where. They are well constructed and fit tight to the TV connectors, which makes it difficult for them to disconnect when moving the TV or the like.<br /><br />After installed, I did see an improvement on the quality of the image, while my kid may not know the difference between SD and HD, his movies looked better with these cables than with the regular ones included with the DVD. As I have stated in other reviews, in my experience I have seen that the brand makes little difference when getting HD cable components. Amazon Basics deliver great quality for a pretty good price. Plus, they offer documentation with hints (something I had not seen with other suppliers) as well as a PDF file that contains the warranty information if needed.
0061122416|3.0|Ok, so this book has been probably one of the most recommended books of the past few years, even residing on the New York Times best seller list for quite some time.     What did I think about it?     Well, I think sometimes one must finish a book and let it stew, to digest it, to mull it over, to think about it for a little while before forming their own educated opinions on it.     My first reaction was that this was a very readable, reading pretty much like a children's book, enjoyable read. The story was enjoyable and the message was a good one. That everyone has a \\"personal legend\\" or dreams and that not too many actually follow them, but that we should, and that when we do, we will find that the majority of the time, our personal legends reside right in our own back yards,within ourselves, not somewhere else, that's it not over the rainbow, but right here.     Very good and well meaning message. I'm just not so sure how profound it is. I mean, I read somewhere that this is one of Madonna's favorite books of all time. Makes me wonder how many books she has ever read. I'm willing to bet she has never read The Brother's Karamazov.     Don't get me wrong. I liked this book. I thought it was very simple and quite enjoyable. I just think it was marketed to the wrong audience, that it should have been marketed as a children's book, and not adult fare. That's not to say that adults can't get anything out of the book. There's just nothing truly profound or eye opening here.     I also think sometimes it is a good idea to read other reviews, before writing your own, not so much to form your own opinions, but to put your opinions in perspective, to temper them.     One review did that for me. Being a white male, I never even noticed the blatant sexism of the book. I don't think this was intentional on the author's part though, I just think, as other's have said, that the book was not fleshed out, that it did not tread in deep waters. Like the children's part of the pool,it never ventured out to the deep end, it stayed in the shallow end, never going more than 3 feet deep.     Also mentioned are the millions of equally heroic people who stay home to raise a family, giving up on their dreams in the process and how they are equally heroic. I think though that this was part of the message of the book. That one can search the entire world for their \\"personal legend\\" only to find that it truly resides at home and that's where it has been all along. It's true that dreams change and morph over time, so if someone decides to change one dream in order to raise a family, well that IS their personal legend now right?     I just think fault is being layed on the book for not being deep enough when it was never intended to be profound. I think it was meant to be a light hearted and whimsical story with a good message. And the message is that we should all follow our dreams, no matter where it leads, even if it leads us right back home.     This book also showed me though that it is not always the most profound or the most verbose authors who are best remembered, but instead it's usually the ones who are the greatest story tellers. I love a good story and this was a good story. I think many authors could learn something from that. You can be as verbose and profound and intelligent as anyone out there, but if you are not telling a good story, then you might as well not even write. The trick is to learn how to do both, to both tell a good story and be profound at the same time. This book only succeeds at the former.

0060558121|3.0|So far, I'm loving it. Hence the five stars. I especially like the story of Essie Tregowan. Gaiman is a fantastic story teller and I have come to the conclusion over the past few books I've read that it is the great storytellers, not the most verbose authors, who are best remembered. That is why The Alchemist has sold millions of copies and is one of the world's most beloved stories. And mine! I believe American Gods will be one of those.<br /><br />Several days later.....<br />Well, I have finished reading American Gods, finally!! It felt like the story would just never end and if one is anxious for the story to be over so he can get on to the next one, then the book can't have been all that good.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this novel of gods and men, it was just too tedious at times and a tad bit boring. And I thoroughly enjoy the subject of religion, so this should have been a dead ringer for me, but it wasn't.<br /><br />As I said earlier, I loved the story of Essie Tregowan but after her story, I kept waiting for more like it and it just never came.<br /><br />I love it when a novel is able to incorporate a lesson or when you are able to learn something from reading it. I believe that is one of the best ways to learn, when you don't even realize that is what you are doing because you are having such a good time. Entertainment can be educational as well.<br /><br />The entire premise of this book though was that America, being a land of immigrants, in point of fact even for the Native Americans, that America's peoples brought their old Gods from the old lands with them and that over time when the old gods are forgotten, they die. Ok, that is not anything really groundbreaking, it's common sense really. The attempt to turn this premise into a story of the old gods wanting to fight a war with the new Gods for their very survival and incorporating the twist in the end whereby it was not really a war after all, but a bloodbath, just seemed kind of silly to me. The entire idea of the old Gods living human lives just seemed trite and boring. I like at least a semblance of reality in my fiction.<br /><br />I didn't hate this novel, I was just greatly disappointed because I feel it had such great potential.<br /><br />In a literary sense it also began to grate on my nerves how Gaiman just could not seem to describe a scene or a character without using the word gray. \\"The sky was gray.\\" \\"His eyes were charcoal gray.\\" \\"The rocks were gray!\\" I have heard such great things about Neil Gaiman and really enjoyed his short story collection, \\"Smoke and Mirrors\\" so I KNOW he has more creativity than this.s living human lives just seemed trite and boring.

0385504225|1.0|The renowned Dan Brown has finally done it. He has taken...    - conspiracy theories and urban legends  - pseudo-technical mumbo-jumbo  - one dimensional characters with a one-track mind  - people so intelligent that they are really dumb  - plot twists that wouldn't fool a six year old  - annoying mini-cliffhangers every two pages  - abduction/torture/investigation sequences out of C-grade movies  - a treasure map and a wild goose chase  - mystical religious references  - wikipedia conversation mode  - recycle storyline from the previously successful versions of the gullibility test  - many more annoying literary elements and factual errors than can be listed here    ... and he has invented the ultimate Gullibility Test.     The shocking truth is that this Gullibility Test really works. It separates the gullible for the shrewd like wheat from chaff. The most amazing part is the Gullibility Test started working even before it was made public. People all over the world voluntarily queued up to part with their hard earned money and prove how gullible they were.    Dan Brown in his great wisdom has named this ultimate test, The Lost Symbol.     If it's isn't obvious, The Lost Symbol is certified baloney of the 33rd degree.
B000P6XU5G|4.0|Rio Bravo: I give the actual movie four and a half stars. John Wayne is at his best and yes, Dean Martin can act. Walter Brennan is a hoot and Angie Dickinson? Grrroowrrr! The extras give a great deal of insight into the making of this classic western. As with The Searchers, there's a lot more going on beneath the surface than there appears. Many, for instance, don't realize Rio Bravo is a stern rebuttal to another classic western, High Noon.<br /><br />I give the video quality three stars. The video transfer on Rio Bravo is not as clean and crisp as it is on The Searchers Blu-ray or even The Cowboys. But it's decent enough even if you won't be using it to show off your system.<br /><br />Worth the buy. If you already own the DVD, you can rent the Blu-ray and watch the special features. If you don't own the DVD, go ahead and buy it. As I write this, the price is only $13.99, so what are you waiting for?
B002MW50KO|1.0|I have a great deal of respect for Bob and own many CDs and albums, but the selection of Christmas songs here is deplorable! Why? Why? There are so many choices of Christmas material, so why try some of the old chestnuts and end up ruining them? This CD seemed to have been recorded in one day or weekend. It sounds tired and stale. And the voice this time around?     Why not some Dylan original holiday tunes? That would have been a CD worth listening to! Or material written by someone else? Or try a different arrangement of these songs? Others have done it. This one will be headed straight to the discount bins by January 2. What were you smoking, drinking, or thinking Bob?
0061719544|3.0|It started off well enough, with some very well-formed prose, but quickly became an AA speech.  The middle 80% of the book merely catalogs Ferguson's drug and alcohol binges and other excesses.    Wait for your library to get a copy.
0385504225|5.0|Rush right out and seize this book before they are all gone. This is another book that will give Tom Hanks a great opportunity to play Robert Langdon. The same template includes visits to famous places, surprise insights into things about those places, puzzles that need to be solved and do in just the nick of time, and a scary bad guy that .... Well. No spoilers here. The template works and the book is a page turner that keeps you from getting anything else done even though you know how it will end - much like a football game. It is a shame though that we won't be seeing anyone else besides Tom Hanks in the movie from the \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" or \\"Angels and Demons\\". Robert has all sorts of connections to various groups all of whom end up in trouble because the bad guys figure they have something special.
B002HK9HR8|5.0|\\"Chinatown\\" is a classic detective flick in which Jack Nicholson flaunts his formidable acting talent. The storyline of this film is convoluted and murky, but the atmospherics and the acting are all first-rate. The early 20th Century California setting gives this film a wonderful ambiance that I have always found to be irresistible. No one should miss this one.<br /><br />The story is basically about the corruption of money and politics involved in California water politics of the early 20th Century. Huge fortunes are at stake depending on where the limited water resources of Southern California are to be sent. Nicholson, a private detective, is inadvertently swept into this maelstrom, because the amounts of money involved are worth killing for.<br /><br />This is an engrossing detective flick that no movie aficionado should pass up. RJB.

The costumes, the reality of the set - they just did a fabulous job on it.

0439023483|5.0|I loved THE HUNGER GAMES despite myself.  I was not eager to read a book about a \\"dystopia\\" - dystopias are depressing.  With all the great reviews, I *knew* it would be a good book...but I was kind of dreading it anyhow.  So I started reading about Katniss, a girl-child who keeps her family from starving by illegally hunting game and trading it on the black market for bare necessities.  I liked her, and while her hard-scrabble existence was hard to read about, it wasn't all bleak: she spent her days wandering the woods with her handsome friend Gale, and evenings with her sweet sister Prim.<br /><br />So I happily dived in, but then I started dreading the moment when things would change.  When Katniss volunteered to take Prim's place in the Hunger Games, and she'd be sent to the city to prepare.  But Collins enticed me to continue: Katniss's first experiences of the Capitol are full of fun and luxury.  She eats fine food, she marvels at advanced technology she's never seen before, she meets her stylist.  The sharp, menacing atmosphere thickens - but so does the crazy, unreal showmanship of it all.<br /><br />So then I started to dread the end of the preparations, the beginning of the Games.  I got to like Katniss so much that the idea of seeing her hurt, or being right there with her on the page as she hurt someone else, became almost unbearable.  Of course, both of my fears came true.  But Collins kept pulling me along, interspersing scenes of real horror with calmer, sweeter interludes.  I had time to catch my breath and brace myself before the next onslaught, much like Katniss does.  The pacing of THE HUNGER GAMES is amazing - the tension ratchets up steadily, page by page, while the progress of the Games sends the reader veering about wildly on an emotional roller coaster, full of highs and lows.<br /><br />And there are layers of complexity beyond that.  How to distinguish real feelings from false ones, when every emotion must be calibrated for the camera?  Not only does Katniss doubt everyone around her, she can't trust her own feelings: where does her bravado end and her bravery begin?  Or, for that matter, her love for Preeta - a romance manufactured for the audience that becomes more real than she'd ever expected it to be.<br /><br />THE HUNGER GAMES is magnificent - a thought-provoking book wrapped up in a gripping adventure story.  I couldn't put it down once I'd started, and recommend it highly.ubt everyone around her, she can't trust her own feelings: where does her bravado end and her bravery begin?

6305603847|5.0|a true classic video adaptation of a classic concept album.  Whether or not the video matches the artists true vision, I can't comment - however this is a snapshot in time to pull out and enjoy on special occasions.
0307269981|5.0|Excellent book!  I really liked The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo as well, but this book was a page turner.  The content is very much for adults only.  Would not recommend this for teens.  I can't wait for the next Stieg Larsson book to be released!!!!

B000A6CLL0|2.0|I stumbled upon the original Star Trek series as a kid in it's initial run in 1966. The episode was \\"Devil In The Dark\\". A story about silicon based beings, and learning to appreciate and cohabitate with them. I've since seen every episode of every Star Trek incarnation, most of them multiple times. The point is, I have some credentials.    What made Star Trek soar, was that it was a show of IDEAS. And it was pretty much the first sci-fi space show where the aliens didn't come out blasting, in a bid to exterminate humanity for whatever fear-based goofy reason. People who were tired of the old warn out themes of good guys vrs bad guys, now had a place to turn. Gene Roddenberry was a thoughtful visionary, who humbly loved the fans, and genuinely believed in Star Trek, and the better angels of humanities hopes and dreams that it represented. He was hands on through every episode of the original Star Trek, and Next Generation. And he brought in a variety of top notch writers with great ideas.    When Gene became ill, Rick Berman took over. Gene never liked Rick due to his arrogange, and incredible disdain for the fans. Rick never shared in Gene's vision, and treated the audience as simpletons and sheep, churning out half-hearted off-handed scripts. After Gene died, Rick became increasingly disrespectful of the Trek tenets.     With Enterprise, Star Trek became yet another two-dimensional comic book good guys vrs bad guys show. Nowhere was this more evident, than with the Xindi saga. Ideas took a back seat. Further, imagination was undercut with the whole premise of Enterprise. With space exploration, people want to explore the frontiers, not go way back in time to the beginning. Who wrote Enterprise? Rick Berman, and his right hand yes-man Brannon Braga. Only at the end, with the shows ratings sinking like a stone, did they bring in some talent. Too little, too late.    I love Star Trek, but putting bias aside, and taking off the rose colored glasses, Enterprise was a bad show that sullied the great Star Trek name, and for the most part, you can pin that squarely on Rick Berman. I thank the lord he had nothing to do with the new Star Trek movie. Memorable quote. Rick and Gene are walking across the Paramount lot, and Rick says pompously waving his hand \\"See all these people, they all work for ME\\". And Gene replied \\"Funny, they all worked WITH me\\".    May a new series return, at the farthest edges of the future, with ideas not yet explored.
B0006IIKS0|4.0|Overall, I wasn't wow'd with all kinds of new live footage and glamorous photos, but it was an insightfull everyday look at the band.  I've enjoyed their music for decades and figured it wasn't all lights and action.  This show lets you know its not just about banging strings on a board.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|Big fan of MB however \\"haven't met you yet\\" I can pass. Track 13 \\"Whatever it Takes\\" is a great track that I have fallen in love with. Such a great song, and Michael's voice is so sexy. Definitely a GREAT purchase and worth the wait! \\"All of me\\" is such a great song that I love and am so glad that he put it on this CD, however I must say no one can come close to Billie Holiday on that one. Overall, I would definitely suggest this CD, you will not be dissapointed....
B0007N1AI6|2.0|Priest can release ANYTHING, just as long as Halford is on vocals, and Priest fans will eat it up- I mean what other way is possible to explain the praise for half-arsed albums like Defenders of the Faith or British Steel? I mean, even when this was released back in '05, it was hailed as being \\"their return to form\\", despite being just as half-arsed as \\"Demolition\\",  and Junkulator.<br /><br />In fact, with that in mind, one should question- what makes Priest the \\"metal gods\\"? Is it because a song said so that they are the Metal Gods? I know people will question my sanity, so shame on me for my honesty, I guess.<br /><br />Not There are two tracks on here that stand out- Judas Rising and Angel. Judas Rising is an epic intro that thunders out of your speakers and totally rampages in one of the best ways possible. Halford gives his \\"I'm back!\\" type screech that is just a pleasure to the ears. \\"Angel\\" is a very depressing, SWOD type song that is very compelling and beautiful. May be one of Priest's best period.<br /><br />The rest of the album is FAIL.<br /><br />\\"Revolution\\" has an intro that is completely plagarized from \\"Mountain Song\\" by Jane's Addiction, not to mention the rest of the song just feels like it was thrown together to make a song for the album. A lot of the songs feel like an excuse to release an album just to satisfy the \\"HxC\\" fans. And then of course, Lochness. What a boring and terrible song. FOrtunately it was a good fortelling of the next turd, \\"Nostradamus\\".<br /><br />Look, I like Priest. But they're FAR overrated. And honestly, I'm sure people are rating this 5 stars before they listened to it because they love JP and would be sad to see the rating lower. Let's be honest. THis album is just as half-arsed as \\"Demolition\\" and \\"Jugulator\\".

B002S0OBFK|4.0|However, I'm not so sure it is going to live up to the hype it's getting.  In a sea of pretty darn good horror movies over the last few years, Paranormal Activity is really nothing too special, other than that it is an American movie and that it is coming at audiences with the same combination of realism and mystery that another little-film-that-could did ten years ago;[[ASIN:B00001QGUM The Blair Witch Project]].  Not that the combination is particularly unique now or even ten years ago, it just appears that when it involves ghosts instead of for example zombies ([[ASIN:B0013D8LA4 Diary of the Dead]] or [[ASIN:B001DJ7PU0 The Zombie Diaries]]) or Belgian serial killers (1992's [[ASIN:B00006FMCS Man Bites Dog]]), it makes a a lot of money considering its cost and gets a ton of mainstream attention.  This movies cost about $10,000 to make and has grossed over $30 million.<br /><br />I saw Paranormal Activity Friday night and found it quite compelling, which if it wasn't the whole thing would've failed miserably.  The audience reactions were rumored to be quite positive, with some people screaming and peeing their pants and so forth, but the crowd around me was a little different.  In fact, given it was a packed theater and the film had previously only had limited release, I'm not too surprised.  Horror films are something you really have to want to enjoy, especially ones that require a more robust imagination like this one.  When it was in limited release the audience may have for the most part been seeking out the film because they are genre fans, but upon a wider release the casual movie-going riff-raff will see it, especially if it means showing their girlfriends that they ain't afraid of no ghosts.  Folks actually booed the film when I saw it and I even heard comments like \\"I'm sorry but dude, that sucked\\" and \\"that wasn't scawy at all!\\".  These are the same guys that will hold their bowels tightly when riding a roller-coaster, instead of throwing up their arms to accentuate the fun.  These are also the same idiots that will be seeing garbage like Saw VI in a few weeks, but I digress.<br /><br />The film follows Micah and Katie, who have just moved in together.  Katie has experienced strange encounters her entire life and Micah, a laughably naive skeptic, documents their experience in their new home together.  In fact, Micah consistently antagonizes this ghostly force by shouting at it and even getting a Ouija board.  The activity itself gradually escalates as the film goes forward but there is far too much to give away, especially if you've found yourself enjoying movies like this in the past.<br /><br />This is well done and uses almost all of the usual tools in the horror genre effectively with one notable exception; gore.  I understand the principal behind not using gore and maybe even why they wouldn't need it, but the movie does lend itself to moments where it could have been used very well. Nevertheless, this is still a very decent horror movie and is certainly creepy enough in flashes to recommend checking out.ate the fun.

B001KR9AP8|1.0|I'm pretty much still a Beyonce fan although she is horribly overexposed at this point.   I'm disappointed in this so-called double CD. All the songs could have been on one CD or she should have added more material to each one to justify a double CD. I like \\"If I were a boy\\" and \\"Single Ladies\\", but more so because of the videos than the songs. Had they not had such entertaining videos these songs would have fallen off the radar because the songs are unable to stand alone on their own merits. Plus Ciara did an even more interesting version of \\"If I were a boy\\" about 2 years ago. The Jay-Z influenced \\"Diva\\" irritates me while at the same time makes my foot tap.    Also, because I bought the regular edition when it first came out and not the deluxe edition I missed out on what I thought was one of the best songs, \\"I don't know why you love me\\" and I like the \\"Ego\\" remix.    Halo is a'ight. I think maybe I was expecting too much from Beyonce. After all she is more of a product nowadays than a true artist. It's a shame because she has artistry within her, but it's overshadowed by her overblown Divaish, sex object persona. I wish she could tone it down some and focus on her craft and artistry like India Arie, Jill Scott or Alicia Keys. This is a clear cut case of money trumping artistic value or integrity. Come to think of it, I'm taking a star off.
031237593X|5.0|This is one of my top of all times historical novels. Sharon Penman brings all of the characters alive with such depth that I felt transported back in time.  Her dedication to historical accuracy combined with her empathetic approach to the emotions and motivations of the characters made her work both stimulating and engaging right to the end of it's 800+ pages.
B000000W5L|5.0|Exile On Main St. is not only The Rolling Stones' masterpiece but The Rolling Stones themselves are probably the single most important band in rock history and to not put a record that features Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Mick Taylor, Bill Wyman, and Charlie Watts all in their prime as the greatest record of all time is a crime that almost every \\"Best Of\\" list is guilty of. This album started out as essentially a collection of outakes but the end result is a sprawling album of eighteen songs that feature such full-bodied blues rock that is so loud that even Mick Jagger cannot scream his way out from behind it to country-inspired songs that are so pitch-perfect that even the weakest song of the album (\\"Torn And Frayed\\") is still stronger than what most bands could ever conjure up. The sound of Exile On Main St. is dirty, heavy, and has a smoke-filled bar quality about it. It is the very essence of rock mixed in with blues and country.<br /><br />I could go on and on about Exile On Main St.--how \\"Let It Loose\\" is one of the greatest songs I have ever heard; how \\"Tumbling Dice\\" and \\"Happy\\" are two of the Stones' strongest and most overlooked singles they have ever released; how \\"Rip This Joint\\" is filled with so much power and energy that I cannot believe there are people who do not like it; how \\"All Down The Line\\" is all the evidence you will ever need as to how great Mick Taylor was; how awesome this album is in spite of the fact that horns are used in many tracks; how \\"Soul Survivor\\" is one of the greatest songs to ever end an album; how \\"Sweet Virginia\\" is the greatest country song the Stones have ever done and how it immediately makes me turn the volume up higher when it comes on. But the simple fact is this: if you have never heard Exile On Main St. before you should listen to it. You may hate it or you may love it or you may think of it as just average. To me, this album was the equivalent of The Shawshank Redemption in that I remember exactly where I was when I heard it all the way through for the first time. To me, there has never been a better pure rock album ever produced, just as there has never been a better two and a half hour movie made that I could watch everyday for a month straight like The Shawshank Redemption.it all the way through for the first time.

B001V9LPWQ|5.0|A Disney Classic!  Only great things to say about this new Diamond Edition Combo!  The Blu-Ray version is amazing.  Combo also comes with regular DVD and bonus DVD.

059305427X|2.0|First, let me say that writing a review on Dan Brown's books is almost by definition a waste of time: There is no way to convince hard fans to not spend money on it; also, there is no way to convince some of my elitist friends that his books are worth even the cost of paper on which they are printed.    Why am I doing it, then? Mainly because I switched camps: while I found the \\"DaVinci Code\\" and \\"Angels and Demons\\" reasonably entertaining, with \\"Lost Symbol\\" my ratings of Dan Brown's books fall to all-time low.  Despite many drawbacks, the previous books had a redeeming quality; they had fast-moving story, based on more or less plausible logic and some more or less believable idea. In other words, they were fun to read. \\"Lost Symbol\\" lacks even this. Well, the \\"fast-moving\\" part is still here; but it is essentially a series of episodes, connected (or not) in time and place by some far-fetched logic.  Based on my previous experience, when I bought \\"LS\\", I didn't expect the Nobel-prize literature winner, but I did expect to be entertained. Instead, I began to speed-read and skip pages after first 50 pages.    As for the idea, I got the feeling that if professor Langdon read the \\"Secret\\", he wouldn't be looking for a secret of lost symbol. Apparently, Dan Brown was too busy trying to squeeze 10 years of Masonic research into one mass market volume, to pay attention to other things happening in the world. For example, \\"energy of thoughts\\" and \\"law of attraction\\" became such a table talk subjects in the last couple of years that they lost any appeal as part of high intrigue and sacred secrets moving the book plot.    On the positive side:   First, I do expect a lot of tourists coming to Washington, DC in next couple of years; this definitely would help the economy of the region.     Second, I don't know much about masons, except of basic common knowledge facts. Now I am curious enough to pick more serious reference book and read more. No doubt, many people would do justthe same. Considering the amount of pre-conceptions regarding masons and their role in our society, the increased public awareness is definitely a positive outcome of the book.    In conclusion, no matter how implausible Brown's theories are, I appreciate the amount of research that he does before getting his books published. I just wish this time it were translated into more interesting story.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|This is a 10 episode season that started as a midseason replacement.  It is an excellent start to what I hope will be a looong running show.  It reminds me of a combination of some of my other favorites: Monk, Numbers, and House, which all (oddly enough) happen to be one word titles.  For those of you who don't know, it's about a writer (Castle) who is tired of writing Dereck Stone novels.  He's rich and flamboyant, which works well with Dectective Kate Beckett whom he meets when a murderer is copy-catting how people are murdered in his books. He assists in finding the murderer, but realizes that he has found his inspiration for his new hero, Nikki Heat (taken from Beckett).  He pulls some strings and gets to work side by side with Beckett on murder cases, using his vast knowledge of murder mysteries to help solve ongoing investigations.  It's a wonderful cast on an even better show. Want more proof? Check it out on Monday night, 9pm (central standard time) on ABC.
0446310786|5.0|This book is truly deserving of it's classic status.  It was so well written and easy to read.  The themes addressed were so important to the time when it was written.  The characters were loveable and you get to feel like you know them.  I can very easily see why this book was voted as the best book of the century by the ALA.  I'm just sorry it took me so long to get around to reading it!
B002MW50KO|1.0|i love christmas albums.<br /><br />i am very forgiving.<br /><br />it just isn't his voice on this record, it is the production.<br />the production style sounds like it was made by someone who has no idea what they are doing NOR does anything math up to Dylan's vocal styles....<br /><br />this is really, really terrible.
031606792X|4.0|This book definitely had a different feel to it than the other three in the series.  Meyer was able to tie up all the loose ends and give us an ending, which I am grateful for.  I don't like to be left hanging.  There were a few surprises along the way too.  While this book was not my favorite of the series, I did enjoy it overall and could not stop reading.  For me, that's what makes a book good.  I'm not one to sit and complain and nit pick at a story for not being perfect if it's good enough to keep me up way into the early hours of the morning.
B000HA4WTI|5.0|This is a great movie and I was able to get the dvd at a very reasonable price. Quick shipping was a great plus as well ! ! !
0439023483|4.0|My 13-year-old daughter found this book completely absorbing. I found the author's post-apocalyptic world a very interesting place, although most of the characters, especially the narrator, seemed a bit shallow. The premise, about a central authority to whom outlying communities must pay tribute in the form of children, reminded me very strongly of John Christopher's YA sci-fi trilogy from 40 years ago. The environment of the Games is a bit like a very brutal and lethal version of Les Stroud's recent television series \\"Survive This!\\" which pits teenagers against wilderness conditions. Combine these and you get The Hunger Games, where the fighting has been moved from the rulers' city into the \\"wilderness\\" of the Arena. Bottom line: an enjoyable read, though the YA faction will probably enjoy it more than us jaded OA's. :-) [Update: My 10-year-old son refused to put it down once we convinced him to try it!]
0385342020|5.0|I wasn't sure if I would enjoy this book what with the ghost theme seeming so silly, but it was a really funny, light and touching book and I couldn't put it down.  For anyone who has doubts about this book I say give it a chance...you may end up loving it as much as I did!
B000K7VHPU|5.0|Among the best movies I have seen, this shows the corruption in the final stages of the Austro-Hungarian empire, the insanity of a privileged aristocracy, the reality of inventiveness and character, while focusing on the love of a young duchess for a common carpenter-turned-wizard. The story line is compelling and inviting discussion, the characters are believable and brilliant, and the costumes and settings sterling. Neither staid nor ossified, this is one movie for all people, and can be watched repeatedly.
1572814349|5.0|My first impression was caused by the rather elaborate packaging,so professional and expensive looking. The book enclosed had many explanations and informative comments. The cards themselves continued to please me with the elaborate and beautiful illustrations. I am extremely pleased with this purchase, and I highly recommend it to anyone that wants a beautiful and informative package, either for themselves or for a gift. You will not be disappointed!
B0007OY2P8|5.0|Anything by England's great Jane Austen is worthy of reading and seeing--if the cinema is done by BBC, as BBC constantly and energetically portrays the real message of the writer, and the characters selected for all roles fit their parts so that the viewer becomes a member of the cast and feels at home. A classic romance, it is not the common fare of Jane Austen where the female is impoverished with the death of a father only to rise again to substantial living by marrying a man of standing and means, but in this rare and novel rendition we find mystery, stealth, and fantasy--delightfully channeled and loyal to the original composition. This is a must see--over and over and over again.
B000MR9D5E|3.0|Planet Earth has a lot of amazing images displaying beautiful parts of this world. It is incredible how vast, beautiful, intricate and varied the creatures and landscapes of our planet are. The thing that disturbed me about the video series is its unscientific talk of millions of years and the possible origin of places and species without any conclusive scientific evidence. The vastness, beauty, intricate and varied nature of this world's creatures and habitat are a powerful witness to an Awesome Creator God. I missed the praise of the Creator of the Universe in this series. For God alone is worthy to receive all honour and praise.  Cornelis Kleyn
B0013A1T8I|5.0|The Golden Compass is a must see. Talented acting, extraordinary special effects, superior direction, and a story-line that is startling, poignant, and exceptional, makes this a movie that anyone can watch repeatedly, and from each viewing learn more. It is fiction, but by reading between the lines of the plot one can find a very real account of modern day absurdities, attempts at mind control, distortion of facts in favor of fantasies--even in the sacred halls of academe where a few outsiders attempt to dissuade and adulterate true research. It is difficult to wait for the sequel, but until then we do have the books which are classics that will most likely outsell C. S. Lewis and his novels.

This CD will definitely make you fill like you can overcome anything that's holding a baring on your sole.  I LOOK to You is difinitely a great song with great lyrics and meaning. All the songs on the track are great not just one song so the CD is definitely worth buying.  Also ordering through Amazon was very convenient, I placed the order and within a few days it was delivered.

0061053430|5.0|Amidst the avalanche of \\"art of\\" tie-ins and \\"technical manuals\\" about sci-fi films, this is the best.  It helps that it has the most fertile soil to plow; the outstanding two Alien/Aliens films.  As has been mentioned in other reviews, the plausibility of this book is boosted by the author's mastery of contemporary military terminology.  Caustic quotations by the Grunts who \\"actually\\" use the cranky equipment provides a wry counterpoint to the optimistic claims of the military/industrial complex.  The technical explanations about how everything works and is tactically employed is utterly engrossing.  There's even a fascinating final chapter in which we are privy to secret memoranda between Company operatives, scheming about how to exploit the \\"Xenomorphs\\" to their greatest advantage.<br /><br />Sadly, this slim, well-illustrated paperback is now as rare as it is admired.  If you obtain one, you won't regret it.
0307346617|5.0|I'll keep this short and to the point: World War Z is great. If you ever wanted to read a book from a totally realistic perspective of what would happen should the dead rise this is it. There are no amazing heroes, just real people trying to deal with the seemingly impossible.

B000002KIE|5.0|I went through and read some of the 1 star reviews of this album and have to say that i was pretty surprised. I mean this album while not musically extraordinary, was excellent and ground breaking. The Sex Pistols were not about hype and publicity. I was a teenager when this came out and all the hype them was about their live shows and the antics they pulled on stage. I remember my mother forbidding my to buy this album for that reason. Big mistake on her part. Most of you snot nosed kids who are complaining about this should listen to your punk icons when they say this band was a big influence on them. And if thats not enough than why is \\"Anarchy in the UK\\" probably the most covered punk song of all time. You should grow up and give credit where credit is due!

B0029O08WA|4.0|I'd say I like the NM soundtrack about 65%, while I agree, it should not have to grow on me, some songs did. My favorites are Hearing Damage, Possibility ( I have a hard time understanding the lyrics though, I like Lykke Li a lot), I belong to you, The Violet Hour ( This sums up Bellas routine relationship with Edward) The Meadow (just beautifully done, haunting). I am a HUGE fan of The Killers, but I was not crazy about their contribution to this album. I also am not sold on DCFC's Meet me at the Equinox, now granted I'm not too familiar with their sound, they almost sound like the Pet Shop Boys on this song, did anyone notice that? The songs that I feel are just plain awful are Roslyn and No sound but the Wind.  For those who loathe the NM soundtrack and loved the first one, yes, I did too, however it had to fit the mood. I'm thinking Eclipse might have some Hard Rock in there. I really had wished Paramore was on this time around and was not happy when they said the didn't want to be known as the Twilight Band. It is what it is. I've noticed that people have certain expectations as to how the movie should be, how the actors should act, the music, etc, My gosh just let it be!  There was discussion saying that they should use all these previously played out songs, for example, My Immortal by Evanessence. That is an amazing song, but lets be honest, its been DONE! They've used that song for just about anything painful and sad. Let it go! We all got a hint about whose going to be on this album since Chris Weitz stated he likes Band of Skulls and Bon Iver. Stephanie Meyers playlist has a totally different feel as well, I think people thought her taste was going to be on this album so I can see how many were thrown off.  I look forward to the NM Score next month, if its anything like The Meadow then this will be a masterpiece!
0385504225|4.0|If you like Dan Brown's books, this one will not dissappoint. In his usual style, he takes you on a ride through Washington DC that keeps you guessing.  I loved all of the interesting factiods he teaches us about the history of DC and its many facinating buildings.
B002ISID10|5.0|I've not heard it enough to give as thorough of a review, but it is definitely the best addition to my collection in a long time.
0385504225|4.0|I read a few reviews before reading this book and noticed a pattern.  If you've read Dan Brown's other books, you didn't like this one.  Lucky for me this is the first Dan Brown book I've read and I LOVED IT!  It kept me on the edge of my seat and I didn't want to put the book down.  I finished it within three days. And because of all of the other reviews I've read, I know now that when I read The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Deamons that I won't be disappointed.
B000WLIEKK|5.0|I admit - I always thought Alter Bridge was sort of lame because of the singles that were coming out from the last album. I felt that the band had a lot of talent (Mark is an AMAZING guitarist but always seemed to be held back in old Creed stuff) but the songs came up short. BUT, I found that they just didn't have the life that this album has. I do think that the singles off this album are good (Ties That Bind, Watch Over You, Before Tomorrow Comes) but I think there are definitely other songs on here that are even more awesome. I personally think Brand New Start should have been a single - I would have bought this album IMMEDIATELY - and honestly, that's what happened anyways (I heard it on YouTube). Fact of the matter is, Alter Bridge ROCKS and all of them are incredibly talented. The songs are written, played, and mixed to perfection. I don't know if you could make a more solid record, honestly.    Also, don't be fooled by the samples Amazon provides. They don't do the album justice. Trust me. Buy this album...and crank it! :)

B002MW50KO|1.0|Let me first state that I am a hard core Dylan fan.  I buy everything he produces \\"just because\\".  I firmly believe he is the greatest musician who has ever lived.  Sure he has put out a few bad albums (Self Portrait); but there were always one or two songs that betrayed his greatness.  While I was a bit nervous when I heard about the CD, I just knew there would be a few songs of greatness.  I was wrong.<br /><br />This CD is awful.  Don't buy it.<br /><br />Bob's voice is so inappropriate for these songs it is laughable.  While the arrangements, musicianship and backing vocals are first-rate, Bob's voice destroys any atom of sentiment that may exist.  At some point there is so much phlegm in his voice it actually made me ill.  Oddly the one song that sorts of works (Must be Santa) is the one that others list as the weakest.  Are you guys listening to the same CD?  A polka \\"Must Be Santa\\" is mildly interesting.  After that is is a downhill.  Way down.<br /><br />I have never really given such a negative review.  And certainly not to Bob.  But I cannot imagine a world where this CD is anything other that horrid.

0786838655|4.0|As there are umpteen reviews I won't say much except that of the 4 books in the \\"Percy and the Olympians\\" series that I've read thus far, this first one is the weakest. \\"The Lightening Thief\\" drags a bit, as if it's not confident in where it's going, and isn't as tightly plotted as the following books. But do, DO! read it and the rest of the series if you love a good, intelligent adventure. The book is suitable for any one and is a most satisfying read.  The characters are fun, there's frequent laughs and some subtle drama.<br /><br />\\"The Lightening Thief\\" might be slightly flawed, BUT it is better than the 95% of the books I've read in this age range/genre. If you aren't totally enamored of the first book, get the second one and be prepared to be blown away.<br /><br />HIGHLY recommend.<br /><br />Pam T~<br />reviewer at BooksForKids-reviews
B002JODUI4|5.0|Very good album indeed even thou a little darker than Random Album Title. Strobe thou is a track to look forward to, because it is one of the best Deadmau5 tracks to date.
B002ELM5HY|3.0|Like most Dire Straits/Mark Knopfler fans, I anxiously await new albums just to see what Mark is up to this year.  This CD definitely has a Celtic feel to it.  Don't laugh, but it makes music that is easy to relax to.  Mark's guitar is in the background, subtle, but sweet.  Not easy to pick out just one song and say, \\"Yes that one is going to be a hit.\\"  Not like the old days of Sultans of Swing. Mark has mellowed out, but he is still the greatest.

0307588335|4.0|While I agree with many of the reviews that talk about how big this guy's ego was, I think he does do a good job of setting the stage and explaining all of the forces and problems on Wall Street.  And yes, it probably is a book more tailored to those that don't frequently dabble in the world of finance and who have more than a bit of trouble understanding how we could possibly let this mess happen.  I think many give the book a bad review because they don't like the author, and I'll definitely side with them.  But I think any \\"average\\" American that's come to hate what Wall Street represents will be able to see the wolf through the sheep's clothing on this one and they'll see that he was indeed part of the problem and not the solution.  So while I'd recommend the book, I'd recommend borrowing it from your local bookstore so as not to give this lousy guy any more cash.
0061730327|5.0|I was intrigued  by William's story when I first heard about him on NPR, and having now read the book, I am just blown away by this young man's genius, resourcefulness, determination, humility and goodness, all of which he has used toward the betterment of life for his family, his village, and his country.  I didn't find superfluous any of the details of his family and village life or the cultural and political climate in which he grew up; all of these provide context in which to appreciate fully his amazing accomplishments.
0374139563|5.0|If you are involved in church mission work or other charitable programs, this book is a great help in understanding why the need in Africa seems to go on forever. Written by an African who understands the functional aspects of aid, the book should open your mind and lead to searching for a better way to support the development of a sustainable recovery program for Africa.  The author shares her ideas about change but leaves room for the reader to engage in  serious consideration of the possibilities.
B0029O08WA|1.0|I love music, all kinds of music, even Indie which is alot of what the music on this cd is considered.  But this soundtrack was very disappoinging.  Now, I realize that this isn't Twilight, by the way I loved the Twilight soundtrack, New Moon has a completely different tone.  However, music does not have to be dull and quiet to convey sadness, pain, desperation.  The songs on this cd are one dull and boring song after another.  The one and only song I kind of liked was \\"I Belong To You\\" from Muse.  It wasn't quite as dull as the rest.  And maybe each song by itself might be okay, but one right after another is just too much.  I think whoever put these artists together on this soundtrack with these songs made a big mistake.  I hope they translate better in the movie.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|My husband and I recently watched this movie together.  We both are Ryan Reynold's fans and I also love Sandra Bullock.      We both enjoyed it very much.  Sure, there were some predictable moments, but that doesn't bother me.  I'm not looking for something that's incredibly thought provoking after a long week.  I'm looking for something entertaining, and this certainly fit the bill!     As another reviewer mentioned, the location of the movie and the setting was truly almost a character in itself. Beautiful!    And lastly, Betty White.  She is as great as ever!

B000002ADT|5.0|One of the best jazz albums of all time. And it's not simply because it's stacking a lot of great artists in there (Coltrane, Cannonball Adderley, Davis, etc)--there's a great flow throughout the album, and the synergy between the artists is readily evident. Each brings their own distinct flair to the table--if you're any fan of jazz this is a must-have. As an added bonus, it's also a very approachable album, cementing it as a timeless classic.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|I guess one could always quibble about what was included or not included, emphasized or not emphasized, from the David McCollough book of the same name, but looking at this production just as an HBO mini-series, it's a complete triumph. One gets a generous examination of a variety of events: the famous ones we all learned about in school, lesser known historical events (John Adams actually defended the British soldiers involved in the Boston Massacre, for example), and all kinds of other things that took place over the course of John Adams' personal life.  It's all facinating and involving, without a shred of boredom.<br /><br />Like the book's approach, the mini-series' seven parts (each a shade over an hour), examines history in an intelligent and detailed manner, but always filtering it through the personal lives of Mr. Adams and his associates, and the personal challenges that everyone dealt with at the time (in particular, the challenges of disease and pestilence).  In other words, the story doesn't take the position of lauding great people in great times, but normal people doing their best in challenging times, which often resulted in greatness.<br /><br />As pointed out by a few other reviewers, this IS some nudity during \\"John Adams\\", but it's used to illustrate things like the cruelty of tarring and feathering (it wasn't the \\"prankish\\" activity it seemed like when we learned about it in school) and the primitive nature of 18th century surgery.  As such, \\"John Adams\\" is perfectly fine for older children on up, though not for those easily upset.<br /><br />\\"John Adams\\" looks and sounds wonderful on standard DVD, with a special mention going to the outstanding orchestral soundtrack (both the rousing main theme and the subtle, crisp incidental music).  In keeping with the theme of emphasizing the personal over the iconic, the special features on the final disc include a wonderfully entertaining profile of David McCollough, which highlights the writer's often whimsical personality and comforting home life, letting his skills speak for themselves.  There's also a terrific special feature showing how many of the adaptation's special effects were created.<br /><br />I often say in these Amazon reviews that the worst thing that a piece of creative work could be is boring.  And \\"John Adams\\" is never that.  You'll definitely learn a few things about our history and our founding fathers if you pick this series up, but you'll always be absolutely entertained along the way.  As said at the outset, a triumph all around.comforting home life, letting his skills speak for themselves.

B00164KYV4|5.0|C'mon boys and girls.  How could you give this movie less than five stars, huh?  This is the definitive chick flick right here at its BEST.  It's got charm, wit, sweetness, enough embarrassing moments to make you fall in love twice!  Yeah, it has some (just a tiny bit) educational value if you want to go there but it's a chick flick first.  Just to comment on that note, I've only heard of the book and skimmed through it at the bookstore but from what I can see, the movie covers the basic truths in the book.  The movie centers around the dating life of Gigi (played absolutely adorably by Ginnifer Goodwin) and then through the couples that surround Gigi.  The relationships covered in the movie include: desperately dating, married, almost married, kind of dating, secretly dating and cluelessly dating.  That's covered'em all, right?  I'd like to comment on all the beautiful casts like the gorgeous Scarlett Johansson, rigid and hilarious (yes, she's hilarious!)  Jennifer Connelly and countless others but my heart must go out to Ginnifer Goodwin and I'm woman enough to admit that I have at one time or another went through what she goes through in the movie - which, of course, made me root for her even more (Watch the movie ladies and you'll know what I'm talking about).  This girl makes all the right mistakes but here's the big catch - it all ends well.  And it was so satisfying to see the happy ending especially after all the turmoil and torture of dating that Gigi goes through.  I'm being straight with you.  I've seriously seen  more romantic comedies than any other genres but I have never teared up at the end (like NEVER) until this one.  Highly highly recommended to the romantists out there.<br /><br />P.S. - love the clip of the '10 reasons...' up there.  :)  thumbs up!
0061914177|5.0|I picked up a copy of CRUSH IT after about two dozen influential friends and mentors suggested it.  I figured it would be good but I didn't expect it to be GREAT! It was in fact, a GREAT read filled with potent information. Where a lot of books go on and on with example after example to fill pages. Gary V went to work and brought you the meat and potatoes. Everything you need to succeed in social media is right here. I am looking forward to putting it to work.  Heck, Gary has already been to the promised so why not follow his lead?  I HIGHLY recommend CRUSH IT!   Even the title is cool! Get it now and prosper!
B002KSPKRS|5.0|not only are these amazing for gaming but also for watching movies,Before i purchased these i thought how can a pair of headphones sound like 5.1 or 7.1 surround sound.I watched a movie last night and decided to use my headphones as not to disturb the rest of the house and they were amazing i think it sounded better than my main 5.1 sound system that i have.Now for gaming,again they are outstanding i used to use my X1s and thought i can hear everything but the X41s have so much more direction to the sounds and you can pinpoint you enemy very easily,I mostly play call of duty 4 or 5 search and destroy and the times its all down to you and 2 or 3 on the other team you can clearly hear exactly where they are.So i highly recomend them ,the only thing is you should buy rechargable batteries and a charger if you dont have one its cheaper than buying batteries every week(they last about 25-30 hours on one set of batteries).

Also, he will read these books over and over and still laugh out loud at some parts.  I hope Jeff Kinney continues to add to this series. I highly recommend this series of books for anyone who has a reluctant reader or loves silly, humorous books.

0679731725|5.0|The Remains of the Day, by the magnificent Kazuo Ishiguro, is the story of a Butler named Steven's, who in the twilight of his career takes a journey to visit an old colleague. That journey is a just a backdrop to the heart of the novel, which is Stevens reminiscing on past events, as a Butler to the late Lord Darlington for decades, and about life itself, including some surprisingly fascinating analysis on the meaning of the word dignity and the significance of social banter.     The events the main character takes us back to are sometimes life or world changing, and sometime are seemingly not very significant, but all combine to really show us his journey from his perspective, and tells us what kind of man this longtime loyal servant is. Stevens is not always an entirely likable protagonist. Sometimes he comes off as arrogant and often he feels emotionless. But he's sympathetic because he sticks to what he believes, and is a victim in many ways of believing it so strongly and of his upstanding loyalty to his late employer. There is heart raging scene of tragedy, which I will not give away, that left me in tears and in particular summons the kind of man he is. Miss Kenton, the old colleague whom he's on his way to visit in the present, as well as Lord Darlington, take a huge presence, and both are well drawn, always from Stevens' perspective. Stevens is kind in his describing of Lord Darlington, but even so the darkness of his late employer is not hidden.     The Novel taps on themes of class, loyalty, fascism, dignity, wealth, and democracy. There is comedy, drama, beauty, and in an indirect way romance. It's magnificent writing which never hints at quite where it will take you next. Highly recommended.

B0015ABRE2|5.0|Dexter, O My Dexter! Wise, understated, committed (ahem, to various things), surprising, loyal--both Dexter Morgan and \\"Dexter the Third Season\\" do not disappoint, and always continue to dazzle with insights and reversals, with surprises and fulfilled expectations.<br /><br />With the advent of Jimmy Smits, as Miami's charismatic Assistant District Attorney with eyes on bigger prizes, no matter the method, the show takes a shocking direction. Dexter takes on a partner! No, Dexter, don't tell anyone! But he does. Miguel Prado (Smits) recognizes in Dexter a kindred spirit--and I'm telling you, Reader/Viewer, you cannot guess what direction the program will go with this character and his own secrets. Like Tom Hanks' Forrest Gump, \\"That's all I can say about that.\\" But suffice it to say that Smits brings to the series an exciting dimension and some over-the-top acting. He must have gone home after every shoot, saying, \\"Whooeee, that was fun!\\"<br /><br />If Season One was an introductory/explanatory show, and Season Two was about Dexter developing his relationship with Rita, his girlfriend, while his sister Debra exposed her raw, but tender heart to the FBI profiler, then Season Three is about deep relationships, deep commitments all around. In some ways I like Season Three best (only with the two preceding seasons laying groundwork).<br /><br />Again, trying not to reveal any secrets, I want to state that THE most significant scene in all three seasons comes in the last episode when Dexter confronts Ramon Prado in jail (Miguel's brother). Dexter was under the assumption that Miguel covered for his bad brother all his life. Dexter was about to reveal to Ramon just who Miguel was. In an act of reversal--one of several the season takes, Ramon reveals that, no, he, Ramon, covered for the dark secrets of his famous, respected brother. Dexter takes that reversal of information and does a reversal himself. My throat tightened with Dexter's extreme compassion and consideration, making the series just balloon with the power of human empathy and dignity. Quite ironic-- yes?--in the framework of a brutal serial killer, but there it is--a deeply moving moment in television history<br /><br />How Dexter manages another reversal in his confrontation with the Skinner--this season's notorious front candidate for \\"baddest\\" villain, is again, a moment of television triumph. Oh, how I love this series!<br /><br />Deep relationships. Deep commitments. Another impending and important moment is Dexter's proposal to Rita and her acceptance, then season-long wedding plans. Not to be excluded, Dexter's long-time police friend and friend of his father's, is the subject of several episodes, all with the intent of showing Dexter's deep loyalty and commitment. He is one caring friend.<br /><br />The new sergeant gets a love interest in a most unusual manner. The old saying, Looking for love in all the wrong places, sometimes can be reversed. Sister Debra also has a new love interest--and conflict of interest with an ongoing case. Decisions about commitments must be made here, too, all adding reversals and genuine compassion to the series.<br /><br />But Dexter's relationships are foremost and they do not disappoint. Nor does the series. Nor does this season. Actually, I find \\"Dexter, the Third Season\\" to be the best so far.balloon with the power of human empathy and dignity.

0385504225|1.0|First Sentence:  The secret is how to die.<br /><br />Robert Langdon receives, what he believes to be, a request from an old friend to come to Washington. D.C.  Once there, in the Rotunda of the Capitol, is found his friend's dismembered hand.  The chase is on; Robert Langdon and his friend's sister, against an unknown villain and members of the CIA.<br /><br />I could go on and on about how bad I thought this book was.  The bad guy was way over the top, Langdon seemed flat, and the women were too stupid to live. The geography of Washington had errors.  Yes, some of the information on the Freemasons is interesting, as is some of the arcane historical information, but nothing really gels together.  There's a federal agency involved without any explanation as to why they are there.  There's nothing to grab onto.<br /><br />With DaVinci Code, there was the whole Mary Magdalene theory; with Angels and Demons it was the race against the clock and would the Pope get elected.  Here's it's about rescuing a friend of Langdon's whom we've not met and to whom we have no real attachment, and about the great secret protected by the Freemasons.<br /><br />The book is an example of bad dialogue, bloated writing, and repetitive scenes.  However, the greatest sin was that I never felt engaged or cared what happened.  Nearly every chapter ended with a mini-cliff hanger and didn't add to the plot or the suspense.  One or two wouldn't have bothered me but every chapter became absurd and amateurish.  Write a good story; I'll keep turning the pages.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't regret about this book was that I bought the Kindle version rather than the $150 signed edition I was offered.  No thanks.
0440237688|5.0|How many years have I known about The Giver? Why haven't I read it before this? Students who have read it always say what a good book it is. It's just one of those things, I think, kind of what my sister calls such things: \\"It is what it is.\\"<br /><br />I take my lunch  most days and eat in the library where I work. Twenty minutes of quiet time. I always take whatever book I am currently reading. One day I forgot.  No way am I going to just sit there, so, aha, what book catches my eye? It's time I say.<br /><br />The Giver by Lois Lowry won the Newbery Award in 1994. That means it was voted Best Book in older children's literature for that year. Devil's Advocate that I am, I always want to know what books were in contention, the Honor Books. They are Crazy Lady by Jane Leslie Conly, Eleanor Roosevelt: A Life of Discovery by Russell Freedman, and Dragon's Gate by Laurence Yep, all worthy choices.<br /><br />So, The Giver. Set in a nameless community in an unidentified future, the story is about a utopian society or seemingly, depending on whose opinion is being solicited. No hunger, no domestic violence, no deformities or disabilities, no painful and lonely old age, really, basically no worries. To accompany those realities, no color, no variations, no differences, no choices. Ah, this utopia begins to look dystopian. Yes?<br /><br />No, of course not, why would you question? Choices, colors, differences have been removed. How can one question if one has no frame of reference? That's where the character of The Giver comes in. In this society children go through a naming ceremony when they reach the age of twelve. The main character, Jonas, has no idea what his future will hold. He has no particular interest in any particular field.<br /><br />During the ceremony Jonas is skipped over, only to be given his future at the very last. Receiver. Keeper of the community's Memory. Jonas will be the next Receiver, an assignment held with such reverence and awe that Jonas can hardly fathom that he is the one to be trained by the old Receiver, who will now become The Giver. Therein lies the rub.<br /><br />The Receiver is privy to all that has been erased from community memory: color, smells, bird twitter, tastes, things now controlled and wiped out of existence, such as snow, and sunshine, and forests. Things that make life interesting, but certainly unknowable. Things unpredictable. Love. Family. Yes, certainly, Jonas has a family of two parental units well-chosen for compatibility, one annoying sister (some things don't change), and a temporary baby.<br /><br />Jonas's dad is a Caregiver, meaning he takes care of babies.

1554072840|5.0|I got this for my daughter when she was 18 months old because she was showing interest in potty training and I had hoped this would help her get the concept.  Well it didn't.  She loves the book and it is a great book for toddlers but it buy no means is necessary for potty training.
0307588335|1.0|This should have been an internet blog, Larry is in love with himself and his team. More so if they knew all this was happening why would the Senior Team (and so called best traders) not do the following:    a) resign and go out and let the world know including the FED, SEC etc especially in relation to the fraud  b) leave the firm and short the stock asap including cover your shares that where not vested  c) look for a job somewhere else    Reason - they were being paid well and thought they could get away with it as long as things do not hit the fan.    If Lehman were the first to let Hank Paulson know about the issues what were they doing about it?    Please do not waste your money on this book and it is a pity you cant give this minus stars!!!!
0385504225|4.0|Dan Brown's Lost Symbol is another novel in the tradition of his famous thrillers.  The Lost Symbol definately takes you for a thrilling ride through Washington D.C. and is another fast paced journey.  Is it a cookie cut book from The Da Vinci Code just using a different subject?  Maybe so but that doesn't mean it fails to entertain.  I will say that the end of the book dragged.  The book comes to a climactic ending only to then drag on and push a philosophy to its readers.  This will definately not spark as much uproar as his other novels but may create some controversy.  It really is a thrilling read and is a page turner from the beginning

B000RW3YYA|5.0|My husband got me started on this series, about season 2 I think, very disappointed that it was cancelled. There is a new Stargate series that as of episode 4 I'm not that keen on, but I'll give it some time. Anyways, a great series, was easy to pick up on the storyline. Lots of action, drama and thrills, get seasons 1-5, a great watch!
1594488878|5.0|I don't usually feel the urge to add my \\"two cent review\\" to the list when I agree with the majority of other reviewers on how good (or bad) a book is, but Nick Hornby's latest \\"Juliet, Naked\\" was so funny, insightful, comic-tragic, and entertaining that I had to join the throngs who are loving it so.<br /><br />What is notably spectacular about this novel is the dialog. Every single conversation between every single character is a treasure-trove of humor, satire and even farce. With dialog this rich, the screenplay should write itself! So, surely there will be a movie!
B0000640VO|5.0|This movie is in my top 10 movies of all time.  Really its a feel good movie, with a great soundtrack.  The the people and their oddities really put things into perspective, you could probably pick a character and know a person just like them.  It also comments on life's simple pleasures, which i think people all to often forget.  Don't rent this movie buy it, really you'll be happy you did.
0385504225|1.0|I was so looking forward to this book.  What a disappointment.  By page 100... Really?  This just HAS to get better.  By 200... If I get one more boring lecture I'm going to scream.  By Page 300 I can't believe how utterly absurd this story is. Page 350... Time to speed read to the end. Page 400 This has to be one of the lamest books I have read in a long time.  The end... what an absolute waste of my time.<br /><br />On the positive side there were a few interesting historical and architectural asides.<br /><br />Recommendation:  Don't bother.  If you feel compelled to read it, go for it, just know when you begin to think it's going to get better it does not and cut your losses early.

B000002J29|5.0|Frampton Comes Alive...Kiss Alive...Deep Purple: Made in Japan...Springsteen Live...Genesis: Seconds Out...<br /><br />Live albums are generally thrown-out, contractual obligations albums that are, often, poorly produced and the performances sub-par. And then, there are the exceptions, where a live album can, literally, make a career happen. Such is the case with Genesis: Seconds Out. Outside of Genesis' first live effort, this one is a monstrous epic. Phil Collins, Bill Bruford, and Chester Thompson's drums are like charging herd of buffalo; Steve Hackett's guitar soars into the stratosphere; Tony Bank's keyboards cannot be challenged on any level; and Mike Rutherford's bass is just the beast. All that's missing is the blinding 70s Genesis light show. There's supposed to be more films footage of this show around, apart from the clips on youtube -- a reworked DVD would be the icing on this magnificent cake.
B001UW58WW|5.0|I first saw David Garrett on a PBS special where he was performimg on stage in Germany, all I can say is he as amazing!...I received it in a timely fashion.  Amazon always delivers.
B001FB4W0W|2.0|I was very disappointed in this series.  I do not have HBO but am a huge Sookie Stackhouse fan so I bought the series.  Did I get an eye full...LITERALLY!!  The story of Jason sets off into a porn story and every episode has at least one scene of his debauchery.  I was disgusted.  I spent more time fast-forwarding the series than watching it.    Some areas follow the story but it's not filmed in first person as the books are written.  There were so many side stories I would get confused on what was going on (of course I skipped a lot of it too).  This never happened in the books.  The sex scenes were very explicit and should be more of an X rating than an R.  I can't believe that this stuff exists on TV.  Now I'm glad I never wasted the money on HBO.    If you like porn, then perhaps you would like this series.  Otherwise, I'd steer clear.  I had ordered the 2nd series at the same time I purchased this one.  As soon as I intermittently watched (fast-forwarding through a lot of it) the first season, I cancelled my order for the second.    Don't waste your money.  Read the books again if you love them.  This series will just ruin the storylines for you if you watch them.  It will decorate the inside of my garbage can until the garbage man picks it up.  Very sad.  It is such a good series...I hated to see more good books trashed by Hollywood.

0802798225|5.0|Brittany Ellis has the perfect life. Perfect clothes, perfect hair and the perfect boyfriend. Or that is what everyone at Fairfield High thinks. But Brittany's life is far from perfect. She worries non-stop. Her mother is always on her case to look and act a certain way while she shoots off to tennis lessons and lives a country club life while her father is always traveling somewhere for work. They don't seem to care about Shelley, Brittany's older sister, who is stuck in a wheelchair and can barely talk and feed herself. And the fact that mom and dad Ellis are thinking about sending Shelley away to a facility that can take better care for her, enrages Brittany. She won't allow it because Shelley seems to be the only one who really loves her for who she is and not what she seems.<br /><br />Life could not get any worse for Alex Fuentes because he is going nowhere fast. He longs to get away from it all but can't because of his role in the gang, the Latino Bloods. He also has a great deal of responsibility of being the man of the house for his younger brothers and mother who works hard to keep food on the table and a roof over their heads. Alex doesn't want his brothers to turn out the way he has but it looks like he is losing because they look up to him and witness his actions as a Blood. Alex may act tough, but all he wants is to be a typical teen where he can go to school, make an honest living fixing cars and ride his motorcycle with the wind in his hair.<br /><br />Perfect \\"golden girl\\" Brittany and \\"tough guy\\" Alex's worlds will collide, first due to an altercation in the school parking lot and then in Chemistry class where their teacher Mrs. Peterson will partner them up together. Both are disgusted to be working side by side together. Brittany prefers to be partnered with her super popular jock boyfriend Colin even though he has been annoying her, pushing her for sex and wanting her to spend more time with him, away from her sister who she helps with after school. Alex has a low opinion of Brittany being a rich girl snob, one that can't get her hands too dirty.<br /><br />When Alex's friends start ribbing him about being Brittany's chemistry partner, he places a bet that he can get down her pants. Soon his reputation and motorcycle are on the line. He also thinks that the golden girl won't mind slumming with him because every good girl wants to walk on the wild side with a guy like him.<br /><br />Brittany and Alex fight like crazy and are not afraid to tell each other what the other one thinks. From this, they begin to form a strange type of friendship, one that changes into respect. There is something special about Alex that Brittany wants to crack open. And if she decides to welcome Alex into her world, the one that everyone admires as well as the one she keeps secret, she may have more than she has bargained for.<br /><br />Perfect Chemistry may be one of the best Young Adult books I've read this year. Simone Elkeles takes on many subjects concerning teenagers such as acceptance, bias, violence, sex and so much more. If there is one book that parents and teens should read together, Perfect Chemistry is such a book.<br /><br />Simone makes sure not to hold back in regards to Brittany and Alex. These two are essentially good kids stuck in situations that are not necessarily of their making. Their environments have shaped their lives. Brittany comes from a cold home, with parents who are more concerned about appearances than what is right for their children. The relationship Brittany has with Shelley is touching and brought tears to my eyes. Brittany prefers being with her sister and help her do such things we all take for granted such as helping Shelley eat and playing computer games. Brittany has a better friendship with her sister than that of her boyfriend Colin. Colin is at the point where he thinks if he and Brittany have sex it will bring them closer together. But I really can't blame Colin for his thinking because his reaction with Brittany is one I would expect from a guy his age.<br /><br />Alex is a wonderfully, written character. He may act like a jerk to Brittany at first but it is his coping mechanism. When you read how he treats his brothers, his friend Paco and interacts with the people in his community, it is very touching. He wants something better for himself but just doesn't know how to accomplish it. And your opinion of Alex will definitely change when he helps Brittany in a somewhat dangerous situation. At that moment Alex because a gentleman, a true hero in my eyes.<br /><br />Perfect Chemistry is very much a Romeo and Juliet tale but not as tragic. The tragedies that surround these two characters are because of those they interact with. Alex and Brittany would be alright if not for certain individuals, or outside sources who make it virtually impossible for them to be together.<br /><br />As for the subject matter, I would say Perfect Chemistry is very blunt. This is a book for the high school crowd that deals with cursing, blatant sex talk and violence. The way Simone handles Alex and Brittany's attraction is very well done, especially when they are finally intimate.I applaud Simone Elkeles for writing such a touching and true life tale that effects teens today. Perfect Chemistry is just as the title states. The chemistry between Alex and Brittany is perfect.And I cannot fail to mention that the epilogue is one of the best I have read in years!<br /><br />Perfect Chemistry is a true winner of a book and regardless of whether you read YA or not, I urge you to pick it up as soon as you can. If not for the romance between Alex and Brittany or the social topics discussed, just for the epilogue alone.<br /><br />Katiebabsect from a guy his age.    Alex is a wonderfully, written character.

B002KDUDG6|3.0|By the title \\"crazy love\\", i was expecting something like a fast R&B song that comes with break dance and stuff. But this album suprise me a little because it turns out to be more of a classic style pop.It is actually pretty nice because I've grown sick of the hip hop and rap songs in the recent years, this album is definitely a refresh to my ear. I can't say i am completely in love with it, but it is definitely one of the must for my off-duty hrs on a cozy weekend.
0440241030|5.0|When it comes to exciting fiction Lee Child is right up on top with his man Jack Reacher. He is a one man killing machine,a mind like Einstein and a heart as big as Texas. When he is coming at you there is only one way to go, thats the other way. I certainly have enjoyed all the Novels with him and will continue to be satisfied with any in the future. I would highly recommend not only this Novel but all of the rest.
0385504225|1.0|I recently read Dan Brown's new novel. It was a great disappointment; similar in style to the previous DaVinci code, but worse, with more foul language profanity, and a whitewash of the dark side of Freemasonry, with very little light about the secrets of Freemasonry. Nothing about how the Freemasonry secrecy oaths often lead to criminal conspiracies involving Freemasons; not to mention its intent to destroy and replace Christianity. Furthermore, Dan Brown either does not understand the Lost Word symbolism of Freemasonry, or he is being intentionally deceptive, a common trait of Freemasonry.

B0029O08WA|1.0|I have been on pins and needles waiting for this soundtrack to be released.  I listened to it several times and all I can say is that I am horribly disappointed.  I understand that this is a low-mood movie and that the soundtrack should match.  However, the songs do not seem well chosen and none of them grabbed me or grew on me even after a few listens.  They really should have given Stephenie Meyer's personal playlist for New Moon into consideration. In particular \\"Fix You\\" & \\"The Scientist\\" by Coldplay really belonged on this soundtrack.  More from Pattinson would've been nice as well.

I think this one scared me the most.  The Body meets John Wayne Gacy.  The movie version was better than most of King's earlier movies.  I just wish that S. K. would allow the re-release of Rage but thanks to the Columbine Butt-heads that will probably never happen leave it too a couple of idiots with guns and ammo to cause the censorship of a King/Bachman masterpiece.

I love Dan Brown's writing style, which is a mixture of fact and fiction all blended together to keep us completely engrossed in both of his novel's. I heard, on a CBS interview, that another book is in the works. I am excited with greater expectations than before.  I am convinced that, if you appreciated the literary style of The DaVinci Code, you will not be disappointed with this, The Lost Symbol

B00007DWNT|3.0|I don't believe the makers of this film intended it to, but The Wickerman presents a horrific view of Paganism, and Neo-Paganism in particular.<br /><br />The plot is simple: The scene is an isolated Scotland on an island fairly far off from the coastline. A religiously conservative detective (Edward Woodward) is sent to investigate an annoymous tip that a young girl has disappeared from the island. He finds himself in a small community that practices Paganism from birth to death (they don't call it \\"death.\\") It is even taught in the classroom, to the exclusion of all other religions. There are signs & symbols of \\"The Craft\\" everywhere. The community is lead by the Lord of the Manor, and played by veteran horror film actor, Christopher Lee. The detective soon uncovers a sinister plot & finds himself its target.<br /><br />The music is interesting with many songs related to various Wiccan practices. It enhances the illusion that traditional Paganism was all joy & light, fun & frolic. One of the more messmerizing scenes involves a beautiful, naked young female devotee casting a seductive spell on Woodward. It is very erotic & convincing.<br /><br />There are many artistic examples of Pagan symbolsism & practives (the Maypole is great.) My favorite scene is the one where Christopher Lee is leading a procession dressed like The Goddess. All Christopher Lee fans (I'm one) gotta see this!<br /><br />I say the film presents a negative view, because it shows a certain callous insensitivity to animals in general--and the detective in particular. It also illustrates just how insular a community can become when it follows one religion at the expense of others. The Children of Innocence & Light are revealed to be much closer to cruelty & darkness.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I really reccomend this movie to all people interested in history, religion, sociology, and occultism.<br /><br />PS. I would NEVER pay the discontinued price of 69 BUCK$ for this film.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0026ICAOS Children of the Corn [Blu-ray]]]<br />[[ASIN:B00005O5CA Haxan (Witchcraft Through the Ages) - Criterion Collection]]<br />[[ASIN:B00003CXCF Rosemary's Baby]]Haxan (Witchcraft Through the Ages) - Criterion Collection]]  [[ASIN:B00003CXCF Rosemary's Baby]]
B002KVSJ64|3.0|I'm a little disappointed with this release.  I was expecting a little more hard hitting edge of the heavier side of Breaking Ben, but I got the opposite.  I find myself consistently listening to 3 or 4 tracks that seem to stand out from the rest of the album. Those tracks are a little heavier and have some unique hooks and tempos that the rest of the album doesn't have.  The second half of the disc feels like the songs kinda run together and I don't notice it. The recording itself seems a little weaker too; not as much punch to the kick drum or bass, and not as clear of a recording that I've heard from them before. I still think their first album is the best.
B001MYIXAW|5.0|this is a fantastic movie! A slow paced drama with an excellent story, and great characters, \\"Let The Right One In\\" lets you into its world. I bought this movie because I like vampire flicks, I had never heard anything about it when i saw it at the store, was just hoping it wouldnt be a waste of 30 bucks. This movie has such a real feel to it, it is very believable not at all over the top or hokey, they leave alot for the viewers imagination.  Also no corny dialog or plot filling in there is a great deal of mystery and mystique created. When there is violence and a bit of the supernatural it hits so much harder because of this films realness. This is not for \\"mainstream\\" movie goers this is true cinema!

B002S0OBG4|4.0|Because much of this movie is about sound--noises you hear at night, etc--a GREAT sound system is really needed.    Also, during the \\"night scenes,\\" a low-grade rumble was added to the soundtrack and it adds a LOT to the experience. I watched the BluRay at a friends' without sound and it lacked a LOT.    Althought some \\"hate\\" this film, I think you need to go into it to be ENTERTAINED and not scared out of your mind, which certainly isn't going to happen.     It's VERY MUCH in the style of 1963's THE HAUNTING---sounds and suble things. No real \\"cheat jump shocks\\"--a cat leaping up on a window, someone's arm touching someone's shoulder, closing the mirror or fridge door and the \\"killer is there\\" -- all the nonsense we've seen for years.    It's like a rollercoaster ride--thrilling but you enjoy it. JUST TURN THE SOUND WAAAAY UP!
0385504225|4.0|Another triller from that master of suspense Dan Brown as this time his Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is called to Washington, D. C. and soon realizes he's not only been tricked, but is plunged into a deadly series of events. Confronted with strange symbols and codes he must somehow decipher if he is to rescue his dear friend and mentor Peter Solomon, a millionaire and prominent Mason, who's been kidnapped and brutally maimed, he also knows he must fight to save his own life.<br /><br />As Langdon struggles to uncover the mysteries and solve the secret of a long-lost wisdom and incontestable truth, the reader is taken on a breathtaking journey across our nation's capital and into the hidden places of some of its most important buildings. It's a fascinating journey with many twists and turns and a really scarey tatooed villian whose real identity came as a complete surprise to me.
0812580346|4.0|This novel was actually better than I anticipated! As far as story goes, the narrative was compelling enough to keep me turning the pages, even though there was not much action in the physical sense.  The next to last chapter was particularly suspensful.      Sawyer does a good job of explaining the science in this hard sf novel, so that the lay person will be able to understand it without getting bogged down.    The main criticism I have is that the characters are not very developed and I found it hard to develop much empathy with them.    The novel can be read and enjoyed apart from the television show, which takes the basic concept and a name from one of the characters and goes off in another direction. Hope they don't dumb down the science, if they even use science as an explanation for the flash forward.    I'll check out more of Sawyer's work.
B002ASVYPU|5.0|This CD Is so good with It's grooves and melodies. I do not usually review CD's but hearing this music and not seeing a single review had me troubled about the groups exposure In the States. If given the right advertising It could become a smash here the way I hear It Is In other Countries.  This trio rocks and the molodies just flow.  Do yourself a favor and listen to \\"The Man Who Can't Be Moved\\" or \\"Breakeven\\" 2 totally hit material. And maybe you have your own favorites soon.  I really do highly recomend this CD. Watch these guys!!  I don't have the bonus with DVD but I wish I did.  This review Is for just the regular CD.

B002BSHWUU|5.0|The following review, which has not been altered, was originally posted as a review for the Beatles Mono Box Set, but is also applicable to the Beatles Stereo Box Set.           I held off completing and submitting this review until I had ample opportunity to listen to each of the newly re-mastered Beatles CDs, both in Mono and in Stereo, as well as to revisit many of the original 1987 Beatles CDs. I have now done so. Although I own many of the original LPs, I have not yet compared those. All listening was done on an excellent, but not quite audiophile (but very close!), stereo system.     Like many of you reading this, I debated over which set - Mono or Stereo --- to purchase. I ultimately purchased and received first pressings of both sets. So what's the scoop? Here is a comprehensive - but lengthy - analysis.     First, its all about the music -- really the best thing about these releases is that it reintroduces the wonderful music created by the Beatles into the popular culture. Love them or hate them, it is undeniable: The Beatles were a unique musical phenomenon and wrote and performed some of the best and likely longest lasting music of the Twentieth Century. In addition to the quality of the music, the Beatles were incredibly prolific: from 1962 through 1970 (a period of roughly seven years) they recorded an incredible twelve (12) UK albums, (albeit short albums by today's standards) plus Magical Mystery Tour and a couple of CDs worth of singles that did not appear on the UK albums (but which are collected on the Past Masters and Mono Masters collections, included in the new box sets). Unlike most popular music of the last fifty years, the music of the Beatles will likely still be played not just throughout the Twenty-First Century, but also in the Twenty-Second. The Beatles are the Beethoven of our lifetime. Teenage children of women that I date currently have Beatles posters on their walls -- forty (40) years after the Beatles (collectively) last recordeda record. That is amazing. The continued popularity of the Beatles is evidenced by the fact that the first pressings of both the stereo box and the \\"limited edition\\" mono box of re-mastered CDs immediately sold out upon - or before -- release.     Second, chronologically listening through the entire Beatles catalogue gives one a sense of the development of the Beatles as a group and of the individual members. It certainly has been a labor of love (albeit somewhat time consuming!) The early Beatles, as a pure rock outfit, were clearly led by John Lennon, who sings lead on most of the early tracks. As time went on, John became the most experimental of the four in his songwriting and in the studio, and Paul emerged as the primary hit maker in the band, and, over time, composed more of the band's material than he had in the early years.     Third, the 1987 Beatles CDs have been unfairly maligned in the reviews on this site and elsewhere. I have re-listened to quite a few of them and - as stand-alone CDs -- they sound just fine. The problem with those CDs is that - like most CDs of that era -- they are a bit shrill on the high end, and lack the warmth of analogue LPs. Moreover, they do not offer the clarity, detail and bass response offered by the new re-masters. Having said that, if your purpose is to listen to this music in MP3 format, through ear buds, or through tiny speakers, the old CDs will serve you just fine.     Fourth, the new CDs offer sound that runs the gamut from just a marginal improvement (some of the tracks on the earlier albums) to a dramatic improvement (especially for the later albums, starting with Revolver) over the older CDs. OVERALL, the new CDs, both mono and stereo, offer much greater clarity and detail than do the old CDs, and the sound is warmer (especially the mono CDs) than the old CDs. Moreover, the new CDs have greater bass response (especially the stereo CDs). Overall, the deeper (chronologically later) into the catalogue that you go, the greater the sonic improvements. The vocals, Paul McCartney's terrific bass lines and Ringo Starr's steady drums - on most of the songs -- are now oh so clear. You will (especially on some of the mono tracks) hear or notice things you never heard or noticed before. The sound quality of these CDs is not, however, quite at the level of the SACD releases offered for Bob Dylan, the Moody Blues and the Rolling Stones, respectively. In particular, SOME of the tracks on the mono CDs lack definition, particularly in the midrange. These are, however, much improved CDs that are incredibly faithful to the original music. Here, the engineers - commendably -- did not succumb to the \\"loudness war\\" so prevalent in CD re-mastering since the advent of the IPOD. With respect to the mono set, there has reportedly been no compression whatsoever. The CDs are actually lower in volume than the 1987 discs. They have a warmer sound that one associates with LPs. With respect to the stereo CDs, there has reportedly been only minimal compression added, and the fine sound reflects that. Only Abbey Road struck me as being somewhat louder. Lastly, the CDs have not been remixed. Although the remixed 1999 Yellow Submarine CD (which I have not heard) and the remixed 2006 Love CD (which I have heard and is fantastic) have been well received, I think that the fact that these new CDs were not remixed is a good thing, as what we getting here are better sounding versions of the original releases, not new (changed) versions of the music (although the mono versions will be a revelation to many). To me, remixing classic music has been hit or miss. I love the remixes of the Doors CDs, but am less than pleased with the remixes of the Genesis CDs, which, in addition to being remixed, are overly compressed. That is not the case here.     Fifth, with respect to the present mono v. stereo debate, I would suggest that a purchase of either set, or any of the individual CDs, would be satisfying. The preferred version depends on the song and/or the CD in question, as well the listener's tastes. If I HAD to choose one box set, it would be the mono. The mono CDs are better packaged (see below), are warmer sounding, in some cases offer unique mixes and are more engaging. Having said that, to my ears, OVERALL the stereo CDs do SOUND better than the mono CDs. They offer greater clarity and are brighter, without being overly harsh the way the older CDs were. That makes sense - the intent was to create a better sounding uniform Beatles catalog, and that is the stereo version. Moreover, the stereo box set includes ALL of the Beatles original catalogue, including Yellow Submarine, Let it Be and IMO the Beatles' finest album, Abbey Road, each of which are not included in the mono box set, as they were not originally mixed in mono. [Note: Yellow Submarine only contains four \\"new\\" Beatles songs, which are included in the mono set on the Mono Masters collection.] Further, as of this writing, each stereo CD contains a video component, which are collected on a separate DVD included in the stereo package, concerning the making of each album.     Nevertheless, for many of the CDs or for specific songs, the mono versions are indeed superior. To my ears, and this is consistent with other reviews listed here, of the ten Beatles albums included in the mono CD box set (not counting the Mono Masters collection), five are (overall) preferable to their stereo counterparts: Please Please Me, With The Beatles, Help, Rubber Soul and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. For me, the mono White Album also comes close. As many reviewers have noted, Please Please Me, With The Beatles, and to a slightly lesser extent, Help and Rubber Soul, are all superior in mono, in large part because the mono versions do not have the left-right issue (all vocals on one channel and all instruments on the other channel) and the latter two CDs also offer the original stereo mix (George Martin remixed Help and Rubber Soul forthe 1987 CD releases, and a re-mastering of each of those versions is what is included on the new stereo CDs). As many reviewers have correctly noted, the mono versions offer more punch than the stereo versions. For the early albums especially, the sound is akin to a live rock performance. Further, SOME of the mono versions are a revelation. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band -- which is incredible in its new stereo incarnation - is MINDBLOWING (and very different than the stereo version) in mono. This one CD - which I had once thought was over-rated (silly me) -- practically justifies, in and of itself, the higher price of the mono set. It is undoubtedly the crown jewel of the mono box set and if that box set does go out of print there will be - at a minimum -- tremendous demand for the release of the mono Sgt. Pepper's. Further, the mono White Album, which had never before been released in the U.S., is so very different - and some of the tracks reveal so many different layers -- than the stereo version! Here are some other examples. For me, \\"Yesterday\\" (which appears on Help) in mono just sent chills down my spine. I did not experience that in the stereo version. Similarly \\"Nowhere Man\\" (which appears on Rubber Soul) is just stunning in mono. On the other hand, to me, John's breathy \\"Girl\\" (also on Rubber Soul) sounds better in stereo, as, being on one channel, the distinctive vocals are clearer, and George Harrison's instrumental break (with a call and response guitar line) is more engaging. As aforesaid, in many cases it simply depends on the particular album or song, and the listener's tastes.     Sixth, the packaging for both the mono CD box and the stereo CD box is gorgeous. As is well known, the re-mastered mono CDs are not (currently) available individually and are only offered in the purportedly \\"limited edition\\" box manufactured in Japan, which has a stellar reputation for production of outstanding sounding CDs with packaging that is faithful to the original LPs. (The packaging for this set reminds me of the recently released and excellent Led Zeppelin Japanese made box, which I also reviewed here). The box itself, which will fit nicely on most CD racks, is constructed of a hard cardboard material and is coated with a white sort of laminate, with very simple and tasteful title graphics and the familiar green apple. Each individual CD package and CD is an exact replica of the original UK mono LP release (except for Magical Mystery Tour, which is a replica of the US mono release), down to including all of the original inserts. Like all Japanese made CDs, each album is housed in a re-sealable cellophane envelope (there is no OBI strip, however). As advertised, this set was clearly designed with the collector in mind. The stereo box is made here in the USA. It is larger than the mono box (about the size of a shoe box, similar to the two Grateful Dead box sets of their [mostly] studio albums). Like the mono box, the stereo box has a sort of laminate, this time in black, with tasteful graphics and the familiar green apple. The box closes with a hidden magnet, like, for those who are familiar with it, the Phish box set Hampton Comes Alive. The box itself is housed in a (temporary?) cardboard sleeve. Each individual CD is housed in a digipak which contains a nice booklet, printed on glossy paper stock, which contains the original liner notes (if any) of the album along with recording notes and very nice pictures of the fab four. The White Album is nicely housed in a slip case with the embossed: \\"The Beatles.\\" As other reviewers have noted, the stereo CD digipaks house the CDs in a slip with no protective sleeve. Why didn't designers of the packaging include a CD holder, like the Bob Dylan re-masters? Nevertheless, the cardboard stock of the digipak is study enough so that the package can be propped open (without damaging the packaging) to permit safe removal of the CD, although you may have to touch the edge of the CD to do so (possibly leaving fingerprints). I suspect that the digipaks will soon be history and will be replaced with more conventional (and horrid) jewel boxes, which would at least more safely store the CDs. (Collectors note: the original pressing of the Magical Mystery Tour stereo CD label has a misprint re: the Let It Be documentary video being on the disc. That misprint is reportedly being corrected for future pressings of the CD).     Lastly, a word about the pricing. The box sets ARE expensive. In spite of this, demand has clearly - for now - exceeded supply. All box sets tend to be expensive, and with respect to Japanese made mini-LPs, these are often very expensive. The \\"Japanese\\" mono box, which likely contains the very same CDs as the Japanese made CDs contained in the \\"limited edition\\" mono box sold in the US, costs approximately, or more than, twice as much. If money is an issue, you can avoid the box sets and focus on the following (listed chronologically): Rubber Soul, Revolver, Sgt. Peppers, The Beatles (the \\"White Album\\") and Abbey Road, each of which is amongst the very best rock albums ever made, and the very fine stereo re-master of each is readily available at a reasonable price. If you want to experience the early Beatles, the 1987 CDs of the Beatles first four UK albums, Please Please Me, With The Beatles, A Hard Day's Night and Beatles For Sale, all in mono, are likely [for now] still available. You can add the new stereo versions of Help, Past Masters, Magical Mystery Tour, Let It Be [or even better, Let It Be . . . Naked] and Yellow Submarine, in that order, as funds allow.     So what's my recommendation? That depends on who you are (and what your budget is). If money is an issue, see the previous paragraph. If you already own any or all of the 1987 CDs, and plan on only listening on ear buds or a less than high quality system, save your money and stick with those, and supplement your collection as necessary with the individually available stereo CDs. If you want the absolute BEST possible sound now available on CD, overall the stereo CDs are the way to go, and they are and will be readily available (although the first pressing of the box set is currently sold out, the second pressing is available by pre-order). If you want to experience the Beatles as it is reported that they originally intended, if you want to hear different mixes (often revelatory and in many cases superior), if you are a completest and/or if you want collectable facsimiles of the original UK LPs, pick up the \\"limited\\" mono box set., which, at the time of this writing, is once again available by pre-order (for the second pressing). As aforesaid -- and this is a personal choice -- if I had to choose just ONE set, I'd go with the mono set, and I would supplement it with the new stereo Abbey Road and the previously released Let It Be . . . Naked. Whether the mono re-mastered box will be available beyond the purported \\"second pressing\\" is, at the time of this writing, unknown and the subject of much speculation. If, however, the mono box is history, then the stereo re-masters are terrific.     ADDENDUM: The only additions/modifications to the foregoing review that I would now offer are the following: (1) I believe that most or all the stereo CDs (not just Abbey Road) are a bit louder than the earlier versions of same; (2) I acknowledge that those who submit that the stereo CDs should have been remixed (like the 1999 Yellow Submarine disc, which I have now listened to) have a legitimate point, although I still stand by what is expressed above; and (3) No offense is meant towards those who utilize MP3 players, indeed those who download the CDs utilizing a higher bit rate (256 or Apple Lossless) should notice a difference (overall) between the old and the new CDs.  Whether that difference justifies the new purchase is an individual decision.         Happy listening!
B001ED7C58|5.0|I was totally pleased with the soundtrack! It contained all the songs from the movie except one (Rob Pattinson's Let Me Sign).  Fantastic listening and has a variety of music genre.
B000002UWL|5.0|This is definitely one of the gratest album ever made by this fabulous British group, and one of my favorites. I highly recommended it. No doubt its wow!
B00005RDRO|5.0|I'd just like to say that I was very pleased with my order, it was in good condition (new as stated) and was glad that it came quicker than the estimated time arrival.  Thank you!  I used to see this movie with my little brother when we were younger and was surpised it was on DVD, it took me back in time.   -Maria-
B000S58428|5.0|A couple of years back I had all but given up hope for modern music. It seemed that all that was out there was rap, over-distorted rock, and cookie cutter lyrics. I now have gigabytes upon gigabytes of modern music. Coldplay was my gateway band, and this was the first album of theirs I ever owned. I love their use of piano, and Chris Martin's falsetto is mesmerizing. Clocks and The Scientist are standouts for me on this album, but every song is worth repeated listening. I strongly recommend this album, and this band.
B001UV4XTC|5.0|A great movie, a great statement about human life -- the best Coen Bros. film to date and a true masterpiece.  Life is completely inexplicable, kind and cruel at turns, without warning or reason.  The only thing we have are the small pleasures given to us, and to want, and to look for someone to love ---- though no guarantee about finding such a person. The film closes with an oncoming tornado, a whirling black cloud that seems to signify the violent mystery that is human life.  The film opens with the following quotation from the writings of a medieval French rabbi: \\"Receive with simplicity everything that happens to you.\\" Possible or impossible? This movie is one beautiful, perfectly made, and profound creation.  Plus, it's really funny.
B002GZQYMK|5.0|Muse has done it again. I loved the use of an orchestra for this music, it sounded great! He is a genius! Though I believe if you really want to hear some awesome Muse, you should go back and listen to their earlier albums, like Showbiz!
0749453893|5.0|Easy to read, updated, covers all disciplines, good even for online planners in order to remember the always practical back to roots principle in marketing. I missed the Kindle version and I hope this will be my last adquisition of a book printed on paper!
B002I9Z8DK|5.0|Always liked the Star Trek movies and seeing them again on BluRay is great.  If you are a Trekkie you definitely want to see the movies on BluRay and will enjoy them all over again!
B001YB29HG|5.0|This DVD is a gem!  I'd heard the buzz about it online but never took the time to check it out.  I finally got it from Netflix the other day and there's a pretty good chance I may never return it.<br /><br />It is laugh-out-loud funny, has wonderful songs, and -- like Amazon's instructions for writing good reviews -- is not too short and not too long.<br /><br />Oh my God, look at my wrist.  I gotta go!
B001F7MSG6|5.0|All around great movie, brand new CD, awesome CGI, I have nothing bad to say about it.
0446581348|4.0|I like the book a lot, it has some great information in it - would like to see more information about different types of products that are available and what are good products versus bad products, but overall a great guide. If you're really into makeup though I would suggest reading more than just this book because the more I read the more I'm learning how much the top makeup artists disagree and it's good to know all the opinions to be able to make up you're own - great book to have though - worth the purchase!
0061767581|4.0|This book was alright.  I bought it b/c I really like Lauren Conrad and I love the show \\"The Hills\\" that is is loosly based on.  I read the whole thing.  It was not amazing but a good read.
B002C2XXJY|4.0|I felt this album was a little bit of a downgrade from her debut Don't Forget.  I liked the sound a little better on her first album, although Here We Go Again, Solo, Quiet, Catch Me, and Got Dynamite have a great sound, all while greatly varying in speed and genre.  Unfortunately, I was a little taken-aback by her transformation from the sweet innocent girl-next-door to the new divaish Demi - slathered in makeup and looking more or less depressed.  Here's a beautiful young woman that feels now that she needs to look artificial to be beautiful and that she has to conform to the rest of the industry to be successful - which is exactly what she swore not to do on her track La La Land off of her first cd.  Also, on this album, she's more angry and unsympathetic, and can't seem to find much more to talk about than ex-boyfriends and sleazy ideas about dating (with the only exception being the track Gift of a Friend).  So, overall, a well-produced cd by a talented artist, but monotonous lyrics and pouty cover photos take away from what could have been an amazing work of rock music.
B002Q63JEU|4.0|I'm way outside the demongraphic for paramore at the tender age of 39, but buying mp3's in the privacy of my own home means that I don't have to get through the embaressment of a face to face purchase and ridicules.<br /><br />Very enjoyable album.
0743298039|4.0|Ok I'm really on the fence about this one. This book has a lot of 5 star reviews but I just can't bring myself to give it a 5. The story was extremely interesting. Mrs. Setterfield's writing is beautiful and I will definitely check out her future work. But I was torn between 4 stars and 5 stars so maybe i would actually give this a 4.5. There were parts that got laborious and I was ready to move on. Sometimes Margaret seemed a little self absorbed. But this book was a wave, there were parts where I was sucked in and parts that just got tedious. I don't give this book 5 stars becuase at some point I was ready to be done with the book and move on. Otherwise, had I not wanted it to end, it would have gotten a 5 from me.     So good story, good writing, just some slow parts here and there.
B000JIHP88|5.0|I was a bit skeptical of this mobile mostly because it looked so large in the pictures, and also because I thought I probably wanted a mobile that played lullabys instead of classical music.  However, when I saw this on clearance at Walmart, when my son was 5 months old, I decided to try it -- and now only regret I didn't get it sooner!  It is definitely a large mobile, but that became a non-issue, and the classical music is great.  The leaves and animals move slowly and calmly but have interesting colors and features, which keeps a baby's interest while not being over-stimulating.  There are four sound options (rainforest and three different classical composers), which if selected will run for about 15 minutes each before automatically shutting off.  No frequent resetting and no winding-up necessary -- a definite plus.  There are three options for light/music, light/music/motion, and music/motion, so it's not possible for the mobile to work with just motion and no sound, but you can have the nightlight off.    The music is slow-tempo, soothing and relatively quiet and has helped my son fall asleep countless times over the past six months.  We removed the mobile arm as soon as he could stand up, and switched the music/light/motion option at just music and light.  He absolutely loves pushing the big, colorful buttons to turn the music on and off by himself.    Practical notes: My initial set of D batteries is still going fine after six months, so they don't need frequent changing.  The mobile was easy to assemble and it was easy to detach the mobile arm when needed.  The only negative was that the on/off remote never seemed to work for \\"on\\" for me -- only \\"off\\" -- even when aligned as instructed.  Highly recommended.
0151013837|5.0|I love this book. It was in great condition when it got to me! Looks beautiful.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|It took me a while to get into the series \\"The West Wing\\" but once I began to understand the characters and follow the individual connections between them I was thoroughly hooked on the series. It was extremely well written and wonderfully acted.  At the time, the second Bush administration was still in office and the contrast between that administration and the one portrayed on the West Wing was awesome.       My son gave me the partial West Wing cd's  for Christmas a couple of years ago, and I almost wore them out watching and re-watching them.  When I saw the entire\\"West Wing\\" series advertised on Amazon at a good price in their \\"bargain of the day\\" feature, I ordered it immediately. I am presently working my way through the first folder of disks and enjoying it very much.      I consider most of what is on TV currently foolish, stupid, badly written and acted and not worth my time.  I am 74 years old, have a MA degree, and have watched TV get worse and wose over the years and frankly, except for PBS and an occasional program, I don't watch it much. What I do watch on regular channels are re-runs of earlier shows. The three national channels mostly aim their programming at the under 21 year old set,and I have not found their shows interesting or entertaining for years. I do not subscribe to premium cable channels because they only occasionally program anything I want to watch.     So, for me, the alternative is to buy the series I did like on tape so I have something to watch that is worth something.  Apparently the powers that be who run the networks do not care about people my age who like to be a little intellectually challenged by what they watch.  They produce stupid, tasteless, boring stuff and deserve the small share of the market they now have.      Anyway, if you are a \\"West Wing\\" fan, you will love this elegant nicely put together whole series package.  It is worth every penny.
0689853637|5.0|Ordered to give as a gift.  All of R. Sabuda books are THE BEST.  Great gifts for all occations.
B002L3RVCY|5.0|At first I thought a cartoon version of Star Wars could never be good, until I was bored and bought The Clone Wars movie. Absolutely awesome. The stories are unbelievable. While the series seems to be geared toward children, it is great for adults as well. I actually couldn't wait for the first season to come out on DVD and bought it on iTunes. I even think the campy droid humor is awesome. And yes, beings are killed in some episodes. They couldn't have picked a better way to bridge the gap between episode II and episode III. I have seen all the movies multiple times, read all the 110+ books and even the comic books and I say this does Star Wars Justice. A must get for any Star Wars fan.
0439875889|5.0|Lloyd the llama asks his young friends of different species \\"Is your Mama a llama?\\" and gets cute rhyming responses that pose a riddle. It is fun for kids to \\"guess\\" the answer. I especially love the the detailed illustrations with the adorable mother baby pairs hidden in many of the pages. All in all quite charming and has been a favorite we return to again and again at slightly different ages (1-3 years).
B002MW50KO|5.0|The first reaction at hearing there was to be a Dylan Christmas album was amusement.  Then the CD came out and I sampled it on a cheap stereo, wincing and cringing as I skipped across the tracks.  Then I took it home and listened ... once that night and three times the next day.    \\"Christmas In The Heart\\" grew on me.    One could write a review of what it's not or what it *is.*    The initial wincing was because, after all, Christmas songs are always sung by pure voices. Julie Andrews. Bing Crosby. Boy's choirs. That lets Bob out.    But Dylan sings it wonderfully. Rough and  phlegmatic, sure, but soft and tender when he wants to be, holding a final high note for measure after measure when he needs to, and then there are the occasional -and surprising- grace notes.     On \\"Here Comes Santa Claus\\" (this Gene Autry song is an excellent beginning, both for the singer and the band) and \\"Winter Wonderland,\\" he's a grandfather or a great-uncle singing to the kids, full of warmth and charm.  On carols like \\"Adeste Fideles,\\" \\"Hark The Herald Angels Sing\\" or \\"O Little Town Of Bethlehem\\" he could  be a homeless man in a shelter on Christmas Eve.  \\"I'll Be Home For Christmas\\" could be being sung by a guy at the piano in a bar long after hours.  Sammy Cahn's \\"Christmas Blues\\" could be a Dylan original.  I don't believe I've heard anyone sing the verse to \\"The Christmas Song\\" before.  As he's always done, he delivers the lyrics knowingly.    This is not a typical contemporary Holiday CD. No duets (who would he duet with? ... Tom Waits would be redundant) and no searching for a Lennon or Joni Mitchell tune. No, the repertory is the stuff of Christmas 78s, 45s and LPs from Dylan's childhood and teen years ... I don't think there's anything here from after Dylan first hit New York in 1961. The well performed instrumentals and back-up vocals look back to 1940s and 1950s pop and country (excepting \\"Must Be Santa\\" - an accordian driven Mexican romp where the singers start out namingthe eight reindeer and just keep going) and the \\"Christmas Blues\\" mentioned above.    Listening to the intentional contrast between the purity of the backup vocals and Dylan's voice, I was struck by the thought that this might be what Dylan was wanting to sound like way back when he recorded his first album and sang about wanting to do some hard travelling, too, like Woody Guthrie and his buddies had done.    By the way, Bob Dylan self-produced this album. Jack Frost is Bob Dylan.    This is genuine, down to the final softly sung \\"amen.\\"
B002K0WBXW|3.0|The Proposal is another romantic comedy starring the Queen of romantic comedies, Sandra Bullock, and the talented and funny Ryan Reynolds. Bullock is one of the best book editors in the business, and also a total tyrant. And she's Canadian. Reynolds has been her assistant for three years and suffers all kind of abuse in order to learn from the best and in hopes of getting a promotion to editor. The problem comes in Bullock is facing being deported to Canada. She quickly thinks of a solution and says she and Reynolds are engaged to be married. Now, they have the weekend to learn everything about each other before being quizzed by the supsicious immigraiton agent.<br /><br />The opening of the movie is great, setting up the character of the tyrant editor and the put upon assistant perfectly. But the movie changes completely when Bullock and Reynolds travel to his home in Alaska for his grandma's birthday. Suddenly, she isn't the tyrant boss anymore, but instead the surprise girlfriend. And Reynolds is now the star. His family is super rich and all everyone is happy to see him. All the romantic comedy plot devices are there, from the quirky relatives, the ex-girlfriend, and the moment of clarity where the characters realize they have to be together.<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie because of Bullock and Reynolds, but the script and plot did them no favors. The supporting cast of Mary Steenburgen, Craig Nelson and Betty White were at times funny and at times cringe worthy (Betty White). But the movie utlimately faills because it establishes a premise of Bullock as an evil dictator editor and Reynolds as the hapless assistant. But, as soon as they leave her world and enter his, that dynamic vanishes.

0061231401|4.0|Rollins has written another great novel in The Doomsday Key.  This novel takes the reader on a journey to some remote areas of our world in search of the secret behind a mystery several hundred years in the making.  Sigma is at it again searching for the truth while also dealing with the obstacles that are put in their pathways.  From my view point this storyline takes a little longer to develop then some of Rollins other Sigma books but the storyline is still very much intriguing, just a bit more difficult to comprehend without the additional detail.  While I enjoyed this book I will say that it has not been my favorite of the series, I was entertained while reading but the pace at which the action unraveled was a bit slow for my taste.<br /><br />An interesting twist to this book is that Rollins really begins to bring the storyline of The Guild to light.  We learn more (if only a little) about The Guild in this book then we have in any of the other novels.  This makes the book very much well worth the read as you can tell that the next book is going to be a great read.  This book is worth a read if you are a fan of the series.
B0029O08WA|5.0|I've never seen the show, nor do I care to.  Read several reviews of the disc in music mags and know 80% of the bands.  Beside being a great compilation it is most if not all new music; not culled from artists current/latest albums.  Great job.  To those reviewers who don't like it... yeah, there's not 'top 40' crap on there because 'top 40' means nothing unless you're a producer or record company owner.   Open your mind and your ears and try something new.
B000GW8OAA|5.0|I got my HD DVD quickly and safely.  It works, need I say more.
B001GZ6QC4|4.0|Yeah so I guess they stuck a little to close to the source material & had Joker tied up for the police so they could use The Joker again. Even though Heath Ledger's dead he would want the show to go on. There will be another actor out there to play The Joker a lot of people said that this was better than the 89 movie but to me there equal neither  tops the other I like both I liked Christian Bale Morgan Freeman was good as always I didn't know who Arron Echart was but d@** he did  stand out for me Heath Ledger was very good I liked Gary Oldman Micheal Caine Maggie Gyllenhaal never seen her in a movie but I liked her more than Katie Holmes. Well acted well put together fun as füç* action film but don't let the comic book fanboys overrate it for you it's a fine movie with or without the hype.
B002MW50KO|1.0|I love Bob Dylan's voice. It really has character and he is able to give the listener an emotional impact. It's raw, it's honest, and the producers screwed it up!    I do not understand what the producers were thinking! The backup vocals are too glossy, the sound production is too clean, making this CD sound like a parody.     Maybe I'm not 'getting it', but to me it's just embarrassing.

B001J53X9U|4.0|Here we go The Dark Knight big hit 2008 I'll get into the flaws yes I do think people overrated it but it's a great action movie. Christian Bale, Micheal Caine, Gary Oldman & Morgan Freeman all reprise there roles Maggie Gyllenhaal replaces Katie Holmes as Racheal Dawes Arron Echart plays Harvey Dent & Heath Ledger who as we know died after filming this movie plays The Joker. Story after a year or 2 Batman has been cleaning up Gotham city & now needs to apprehend The Joker Batman needs all the resources to get The Joker so D.A Dent & Gordon to get The Joker D.A Dent has made a lot of enimies especially with Maroni so most of the crime bosses hire The Joker but you see The Joker wants chaos in Gotham He wants to bring the best of people down to his level. Harvey Dent & his girlfriend Racheal Dawes are kidnapped & put in diffrent locations when Batman arrives he finds Dent instead of Racheal the cops are to late both buildings are blown up Racheal is killed & the blast hits  part of Dent's face.

Really, really boring.  Main character is worthless, wanders through the book making a decison maybe once.    If you want a quick, fun, thriller read go for The Ice Limit or Old Man's War.  At last those don't talk down to you.    If I could have given this book a 0 star review I would have.

0439023483|4.0|This novel has been out for a couple of years now and I have finally made the decision to give it a read. It has been on the top of my \\"to buy\\" list for a while now and seeing how I was running out of \\"must have\\" novels to read I gave it a shot. To my surprise this novel was fantastic and blew away any doubts of a bad read in my mind. As always I will try to keep my review as unbiased as possible and try to avoid giving away any of the crucial spoilers that we all hate reading about in reviews.<br /><br />Hunger Games//<br />Katniss and her family live in Panera, a futuristic America that is split into 13 districts, and we see the hardships she faces. Katniss spends most of her time hunting in the forbidden forest to provide food for her mother and sister after her father's tragic death in the coal mines. Each year the government has a forced \\"Hunger Games\\" where 24 tributes ( two from each district that are teens from ages 12-18 ) are selected to fight to the death, where only one can survive. When Katniss's younger sister is called to be a tribute, Katniss volunteers to take her place without hesitation to face off against fellow district 12 tribute, Peeta, who is the baker's son.<br /><br />The tributes are allowed to get help during their battles in the arena so they have to gain favor with the public. Katniss and Peeta's trainers come up with a plan to really attract the audience's attention and bring them into the lime light. For the first time ever in the hunger games two tributes will be a couple who will fight together until the very end. Katniss and Peeta's romance help them secure sponsors who are willing to pay the high expense of sending them help in times of dire need in the arena. Though this was a plot by their trainers, Peeta really does love Katniss and used it to tell her his true feelings. Katniss at first believes he is acting his part but gets a sense that Peeta really does love her. She uses the scheme to hide his obvious advances and to figure out her own feelings. It will take all of Peeta's and Katniss's wits, skills, and instincts to survive the arena and become the Victor! But who will end up winning?<br /><br />This book was very well written and cleverly told to keep the reader very much entertained. The entire time I read this novel I couldn't put it down. This is like the gladiator for teens and it really creates a world that is almost believable. You can say it is a mixture of The Game and 1984 mixed up into one grand novel. It contains a complex romance that gets even more difficult for Katniss to understand as the days pass by and has loads of great dialogue ranging from serious to humorous. This has a little bit of everything to keep anyone entertained. Don't worry science geeks they even have flying vehicles and bioengineered animals that have been altered for the purpose of war!<br /><br />The pacing of this story is excellent as you have your slower dramatic scenes mixed in with vicious acts of violence that just blend in so well you never have a dull moment. The author did a wonderful job creating her characters and making the reader hope and pray that they succeed. Every character has depth and personality, which make them stick in our minds even after we have finished reading the book. When you read a novel and can't remember half the characters when you are finished you know the book was not very good. Every single person in this story has a mystery behind them that is just waiting to be explored.<br /><br />Don't let this simple yet complex story line confuse you. This is definitively a read for anyone over the ages of 12 due to its complex romance, humor, and bloody gladiator style combat. It crosses the gender barriers as it is not a girl or a boy book but both. It is hard to give a great novel a numerical value as people have different types of stories they love to read. I myself do not find non-fiction or investigative novels to be that entertaining and would rate such a novel lower then someone who might love them. This multi-platform novel deserves at least a 4.5/5 regardless the type of novels you love to read and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to escape reality and emerge themselves in a world of mischief and courage.<br /><br />Hunger games will leave you craving for more as every word digs deeper and deeper into your mind and creates a world so realistic and intriguing you just can't help but to imagine what happens next. What happens to the Victor after the games? How do the families and friends of the fallen react? How does the public react? Thankfully the second novel Catching Fire has hit the shelves and you will not be disappointed as it is just as good and entertaining as the first!!!!<br /><br />Note: This is my first review so hopefully everyone who reads it enjoys it. I plan on doing more here as well as my personal website (non-profit with no adds...I don't make money I just love reading and writing and hope to write my own novel soon) that I am having made at [...] if anyone is interested.

B001PU8N0I|5.0|i have read the book and bought this item. normally you always tend to be sometimes a little unhappy with the making of a dear book. in this case i didn't felt it that way. i loved the book and i loved how they make it.    i think that claire foy did a fantastic job as little dorrit. all the actors were amazing and overall i'm really happy with this production. in the end it tend to be a little rushed but i consider that you don't need to read the book in order to understand this mini-series.    i don't think there can be anybody unhappy with buying this product. i've already watch it 3 times and can watch many many more times.    andrew davies did it again.
B001C48EF6|5.0|As an English history buff, I have watched different versions (A&E's with Victoria Hamilton & Jonathan Firth as well as the 6-part BBC series with Annette Crosbie) and found this one to be a most credible and watchable docu-drama.  Emily Blunt does an impressive job of playing the young Victoria, both prior to and after her coronation.  I found her interpretation to be a little subdued though, as I believe the director did not emphasize Victoria's unpredictable personality as well as her willfulness.  I also found there to be a difference of historical rendition regarding Albert's level of initial love for Victoria.  Other interpretations have made a point of his reluctance to enter the marriage more than this telling.  My understanding was that it took several years for him to bond to her, verus her immediately falling in love.<br /><br />I particularly loved the costume and hair designs.  They were exquisitely and accurately executed.  The attention to detail cannot be overlooked.  The viewer truly feels transported in time and place.  The music also is well done and does not overpower the story.<br /><br />There is much data to convey in this story for the span of time the movie covers, so it is not easy to grab every important detail, but overall, I think this production has done an excellent job.
B001QMCJ1Y|5.0|Fly Away Home is well acted and written yet I bought it especially for the wonderful in-flight scenes of the geese.  Although I have to admit that every time I view it just to once again see the cinematography of the flying geese the storyline and acting pull me in and I end up watching the whole thing again.
B0000691TJ|5.0|as a long time fan of the ramones [the band who invented punk]i love this album .and the rhino cd is just great.  it has a great sound and lots and lots of extra bonus songs.....ilove this cd too tough...they had a new drummer and it shows ....i still think marky great though!!!but i think each of the 3 drummers they had added his own signature sound without losing that ramones song structer.dee dee wrote nine of the songs on the 1984 release.get this cd you will love it !!!!

I love that she keeps you moving the whole 20 minutes and I am not watching the clock at all or having to stop to take breaks and wipe down machines. My goal is to do this workout every other day to give my muscles a break in between. I really think I am going to end up sticking with this workout and getting some of her other workouts and giving up the gym memberships. Keep up the great work Jillian. I am also a huge fan of the tv show.

B002JODUI4|5.0|I originally heard of Deadmau5 during Ultra fest last year and was blown away.  I immediately picked up his album Random Album Title and has quickly become one of my favorites.    This album doesn't disappoint.  Right from the very start you get a dirty drum beat that transforms into a sick bass line.  My favorite song is definitely 16th Hour but unfortunately he follows it up with his weakest track  , in my opinion, Strobe, right on the end of the CD!    Vocals are kept to a minimum and are used to great effect.  I recommend this album to any trance listener who is somewhat familiar with the genre.  If you're just getting into trance start with Random Album Title and move to this one.
B000003337|5.0|I recently went through the whole QR discography, starting with this CD, going through the success years, and the wasteland of the band's 90s/00s issues.     My conclusions after hours of listening is: the consensus is that the band hit the ceiling with Metal Health and declined irreversebly there after. I disagree. I think all QR albums are pretty much at the same level all the way to Rehab.     The real question is why was MH so successful (n.1 in the US) when that CD was as good as the others. Actually if I have to be fair, QR's output including MH was never that good really-Kevin's (RIP) voice style is definitely an acquired taste, and no offense but CCavazo's playing is nothing to write home about compared to many of his peers in the era. Again, from Metal Health to Alive and Well, QR3 with Shortino or Guilty Pleasures, the level is very, very even.    That's why dear reader we recommend the RandyRhoads years CD to you as the band's best. The songs are really good. The vocals grate but RR's playing is just terrifying. I can only imagine other guitarists being shocked watching RR play live back in the days. The man was just way too ahead, his classical/speed picking technique truly an alter-ego to Eddie Van Halen's tapping/dive bomb antics. Buy and enjoy!
B00008N6N5|4.0|Hustler Magazine was the epitome of poor taste and Jerry Falwell with his mother in an out house was enough to \\"shock the conscience;\\" those were the days.

B00267N3DQ|5.0|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs Diamond Edition is truly a classic dvd with the added value of modern technology.   My 4-year old son was so excited when I received this dvd and viewed this movie for the first time along with me. I knew I would love it, because I had seen this movie before but was so happy to see that my son absolutely loved it as well.  I have always loved this movie but the added bonus of the Diamond Edition makes this version well worth it.  It includes the 1 disc dvd and the 2 disc Blu Ray so you can play it on your blu ray player or dvd player. The picture quality and color is amazing and the high definition sound is the best quality.  The Blu Ray discs also offer games like unscramble the scrambled image, which princess are you like, and a matching game that the whole family can enjoy together.  It also contains a music video and a sing-a-long that my son just loves.  Backstage disney gives us a glimpse into Disney's original studio,  some of the original storyboards, and much more.  This is a great value for a timeless classic movie that my whole family really loves.  I was pleasantly surprised what a difference this version was over my previously owned Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.  I cannot say enough good things about the Diamond Edition of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
B00158K0S8|5.0|This film looks great in HD on Blu-ray, it looks like it was filmed yesterday, when in reality it was filmed some 40 years ago. Im not going to give anything away about the movie, But I would recommend everyone see it, George C. Scott does a great job as Patton.
B0025KVLV0|4.0|This was the Beatles' last album, released in May 1970 shortly after the announcement of the group's breakup. It consists mostly of material recorded in January 1969 for a proposed television special and album called GET BACK, both of which the group ultimately scrapped. Eventually the television special evolved into a motion picture, LET IT BE, and this album was intended to be its soundtrack. Legendary record producer Phil Spector was brought in remix and assemble the final package.     The image that LET IT BE presents of the individual Beatles is striking. John Lennon is portrayed somewhat as a buffoon -- a clown not to be taken seriously. All the silly ad-libs and dialogue which link several of the tracks are his, and his songs (with one notable exception) are lightweight throwaways. Paul McCartney, on the other hand, has the \\"serious\\" stuff. George Harrison's material is arguably the strongest of the three, foreshadowing his upcoming ALL THINGS MUST PASS. And Ringo Starr? Well, he's only the drummer. In fact, Ringo was relegated to the role of mere session drummer during the sessions that produced the orchestral overdubs that are prominently featured on \\"Across the Universe,\\" \\"I Me Mine\\" and \\"The Long and Winding Road.\\"     LET IT BE opens with Lennon's silly \\"'I Dig a Pygmy' by Charles Hawtrey and the Deaf Aids. Phase one in which Doris gets her oats,\\" which immediately segues into \\"Two of Us,\\" an acoustic driven McCartney-Lennon duet which, except for the stupid intro, is a strong piece of work. Despite being a duet, Paul is the main focus here, with John simply as backup. Thus a pattern is set.     The next track, John's \\"I Dig a Pony,\\" taken from the group's last public performance on the roof of the Apple building, is weak. While the performance is good, the material is mediocre.     Lennon's only redeeming performance is the next song, \\"Across the Universe.\\" Written and recorded in early 1968, this beautiful ballad is, in my opinion, the highlight of theentire album. It could have easily been a smash single release. Although Spector applied his famous Wall of Sound technique to it, the treatment works. This version is much more preferable than the sped-up, unadorned mix which appeared earlier on the various-artist British charity compilation NO ONE'S GONNA CHANGE OUR WORLD.     \\"Across the Universe\\" is followed by another masterpiece, George Harrison's \\"I Me Mine\\" - the last song ever recorded by the Beatles (January 1970). Again, this track would have made an excellent single. Spector's use of strings, and his subtle use of editing - the original recording was only a minute long - combine to create a heart-felt performance that really rocks.     From here the quality of the album begins to slide. \\"Dig It\\" is a short snippet of a recording allegedly over twelve minutes long. Thankfully we are exposed only to less than a minute of Lennon's pointless drivel about Rolling Stones, CIA, BBC, and Doris Day. This fades into an-lib whereby John, once more playing the idiot, squawks in a high-pitched Monty Pythonesque female impressionistic voice \\"That was `Can You Dig It' by Georgie Wood. Now we'd like to do `Hark, the Angels Come.'\\"     This leads directly into the title track. Although a very strong performance with a much improved guitar solo as compared to the million-selling single release that preceded the album a couple of months previously, the album version of \\"Let It Be\\" suffers from Phil Spector's \\"reproduction.\\" Spector did not add any overdubs (all of the overdubs were done prior to his involvement with the project), but his remix over-emphasizes the horns and cellos, as well as puts an ungodly amount of reverb on the cymbals.     Side One's final track, \\"Maggie Mae\\" is a short Lennon throwaway romp that ends abruptly. Very insubstantial, it presents more of Lennon the Clown.     Side Two opens up with the Beatles back on the Apple roof. \\"I've Got a Feeling\\" is a combination of two songs - one by McCartney, the other by Lennon. It rocks, but once again, Lennon's contribution is definitely substandard compared to McCartney's. Lennon begins to ad-lib \\"Oh My Soul\\" at the end.     The next song, \\"One After 909,\\" is also from the rooftop performance. One of the earliest Lennon-McCartney compositions, it sounds like what it is - a lightweight jam. At the end Lennon starts singing \\"Danny Boy.\\"     \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" is probably the most controversial song on the album. This slow McCartney ballad, like \\"Across the Universe,\\" received the full Phil Spector Wall of Sound treatment (18 violins, four violas, four cellos, one harp, three trumpets, three trombones, Ringo's drums and 14 singers). Although its composer went on record condemning Spector's use of overdubs on it, this recording was released as a single in the U.S. and went on to become the Beatles' 20th and final number one hit. In all fairness, the string and choir-laden performance had just the right Pop/Soft Rock/Easy Listening/Adult Contemporary sound needed for massive exposure on the AM airwaves. This, coupled with the fact that it was probably going to be the Beatles' last record, assured its success. Unfortunately, with or without the overdubs, the song is not all that good. It is nowhere in the same league as previous classic McCartney ballads like \\"Yesterday\\" or \\"Hey Jude.\\"     After Phil Spector's strings fade into the sunset, we hear another silly Lennon ad-lib (\\"The Queen says `No' to some pot-smoking FBI members\\") leading into the album's penultimate number, \\"For You Blue.\\" This George Harrison blues tune was released as the flip side of the \\"Long and Winding Road\\" single. This was a very good choice, as George puts in another strong performance.     The album closes with \\"Get Back,\\" originally the title track to the aborted television documentary and album, and a song which had been a massive number one single a year previously. The version here is similar to the single release, but features dialogue at the beginning. Instead of a fading coda at the end like on the single, the version here stops cold, followed by a final ad-lib from Lennon (taken from the group's final rooftop performance): \\"I'd like to say `Thank you' on behalf of the group and ourselves and I hope we passed the audition.\\"     Although LET IT BE works as a cohesive unit, its compilational natures makes it weaker than any work preceding it, save for another soundtrack, YELLOW SUBMARINE. Much of the blame must be put on the material itself, mostly second-rate material recorded at a time when the band was tired and had apparently ran out of good ideas (Its recording followed only a few months after the completion of the \\"White Album\\"). The strongest songs from the January 1969 sessions, \\"Get Back\\" and \\"Don't Let Me Down,\\" were released later that spring as a single. LET IT BE includes only one of these songs, and in a mix much inferior to that of the single. The album's strongest cuts are material recorded long before (\\"Across the Universe\\") or after (\\"I Me Mine\\") the main sessions. Much as been written vilifying Phil Spector's addition of strings and choir, but the reality is Spector took what was a lousy album and made it better. He selected better takes of \\"Two of Us\\" and \\"I Dig a Pony.\\" And he mercifully truncated \\"Dig It.\\" Now if only he had scrapped the dialogue...
0385504225|1.0|I stopped reading this book after 50 pages.  It is so boringly formulaic and the writing is so poor that I could not continue.       The book is full of nonsense platitudes like \\"and he knew that he alone had the secret that would make him incalculably powerful\\"  or junk like \\"he rushed into the Atrium, maneuvering his six-foot-three body with agility, glancing back just once to catch a glimpse of yadda yadda\\" or \\"he knew that all his preparation would soon pay off in a way that no one in the world could have predicted or would ever know\\"    It's full of people running.  Chases.  Chapters ending with sentences like \\"all would soon become clear\\"  and \\"he knew that his next step would determine whether he lived or died\\"    It's cotton candy reading.   Ernest Hemingway this isn't.  It's as if Bart Simpson wrote a novel.  It's Dante's Inferno without Dante or the Inferno, just leaving me in hell.
0307266303|4.0|This book was a thoroughly enjoyable and interesting read.  \\"Born to Run\\" really tells two stories.  One is a narrative of a journalist who begins looking into the Tarahumara tribe of Mexico and their uncanny ability for long distance running.  The second story is more of a look at distance running from a research perspective.  McDougall comments on how things such as shoe technology and the development of the sport has taken man away from their primal roots in which we were capable of running nearly a hundred miles barefoot all in the pursuit of dinner! I'm an avid runner and consistently finish near the top of large marathons.  This book was an enjoyable read for me and would also be fascinating to amateur and non-runners alike.
B001V9LPWQ|4.0|This classic Disney tale really shines in this beautiful transfer to Blu-Ray.  The hand-drawn animation, along with stunning imagery and colors, is finely showcased in high definition.  The Dolby mix really brings new life to all the classic Disney songs in this feature, and I was pleasantly suprised that the audio had been re-mixed to take advantage of ambient surround effects.  The Blu-Ray has everything you would expect - stunning picture and sound quality. Animation always looks pretty good in high definition, and the old school, classic Disney animation in this movie is no exception.  You can certainly see the difference in fine detail and movement in such animation in comparison to modern computer-generated Pixar fare, but the subtle reduction in perfect, life-like movement is made-up for with the classic style, look and feel of animation from classic Disney.<br /><br />As far as the story goes, who doesn't know that Snow White must be saved from the vain and murderous Queen?  The story still resonates with young children - my youngest was on the edge of her seat throughout the movie.  The disc combo is priced at a bargain, and makes a nice addition to any classic Disney or home-library collection.
0307454541|4.0|It saddened me to know that Larsson passed away several years ago and there are only three novels in this captivating series.  \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\\" captures the reader's attention almost immediately.  Blomkvist is an extremely relatable character while Salander is an engaging femme fatale in this dark Noir novel.  The reader can easily envision the cold and lonely islands of Sweden as Larsson does an excellent job creating the imagery necessary to tell such a complex yet gripping tale.  Overall, I'd highly recommend \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.\\" I've already started reading \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\" as I understand this is a worthy continuation of Blomkvist and Salander's story.
B0029LHW4A|4.0|No contemporary band does classic rock better than JET. Shaka Rock is a great example of how far JET has come, and how far JET will go. My favorite tracks are Seventeen, La Di Da, and Times Like This.
B002C6K7NA|5.0|The band definitely covers some ground as far as influences goes. Lots of strong southern rock guitar playing, great performances and strong writing. I have always been a fan of Skynrd, but my tastes mostly leaned more towards heavier rock, which by the way is something that Skynrd blends into the southern and country sounds with ease on this disc. I do like just about any kind of guitar based music though and the continuity of Lynrd Skynrd delivering great guitar work and great songs and performances to support that guitar display throughout every release and every lineup change is something that I have always recognized and appreciated.<br /><br />The recording process has changed greatly from low volume amps and tape to anything goes with the modern digital methods and the band has changed in the same way with line up changes and the years expanding the direction and playing styles of band members, but Gary Rossington has been present and holding the lantern through it all and other original members were there until fairly recently too, also maintaining continuity, so if you liked Skynrd back in the day as I did, there is definitely some music that even the Skynrd purist will love if they get past the fact that so many have passed on and others have picked up the flag and continued to run with the same level of passion, influences and integrity. Their story reminds me of how the Oak Ridge Boys have continued on for generations since the WWII era.<br />There is also some pure Americana on this particular disc and although this is a Southern band, some of these lyrics to speak to America's true north on liberty's compass.This IS a GREAT AMERICAN BAND as it has always been.<br /><br />Even the one or two songs that I would tend to skip when I first bought this have now revealed themselves to be must listen tracks. The only song that I can still pass on is the song Skynrd Nation.  There are just too many over used cliche's in the lyrics.<br /><br />Johnny Van Zant does a truly great job on the vocals here too. He really does. I respect that Ronnie was the voice and pillar for so long and that is to be respected, but Johnny grew up alongside him and was part of the same environment and he honors what was while standing very strongly on his own, showing what he drew from many of those same experiences. If you like Southern Rock, Country, Blues Rock or Hard Rock, this CD has something for you and if you like all of those styles, then this entire CD will really impress you as it's own thing.ls here too.

B002BSHXJA|3.0|The Beatles are the Musical Gods.  Their music is Nirvana, perfection.  These \\"remasters,\\" ok, whatever.    Stereo and Mono, the sound is nearly indescernible (that means hardle noticeable).  If you want to sit around with a group of your friends at night, drinking wine, and comparing the 1987 releases to these, second by second, note by note, with $1,000 headphones (sorry, ear-buds), or $25,000 sound systems (sorry, \\"audiophile generating pulse transmission systems) with $50,000 speakers (err...Eustachian Tube Auxillary Enhancement Component Skins), great!  You'll \\"hear\\" a difference.  You better!  THEY are telling you you will!    \\"Oh, my, I thought John was sitting right next to me, just now...!\\"  Right.  \\"I just heard the snare drum wires rattling!\\"  \\"Listen, you can just FEEL George's guitar pick on the 'A' string!\\"    Most people are going to listen to these as they drive around in their cars, while talking on their cell phones, texting, checking out their Facebook friend toll, and eating their large fries with cheese.    If you REALLY, TRULY, SINCERELY, want to hear The Beatles as WE (i.e., FIRST GENERATION) heard them, the way they ACTUALLY sounded to US, The Chosen Few, then you have two choices (a)travel back in time, or (b) get yourself and old, 2&1/2 inch speaker transistor radio on eBay, and wait until a radio station plays one of their masterful songs.    Oh, then you have to be, say, 8-12, or whatever the age is now while the magic is still intact (what would that be now...4...5?)    If not, then you are out of luck.     You are NEVER going to get the \\"experience\\" like WE did.  Never.  Regardless of how explicitly they \\"remaster, remix, and re-market\\" them.  Regardless of the phenomenal quality of your audiophile system.     Never. Ever.      The Beatles, their music, live(s) forever in our memory, and in \\"the air...\\" as Paul said.  (He was \\"the cute one,\\" by the way, before he became second fiddle to John, \\"the smart one\\").  Imagine there're no downloads, it's impossible to try...no copying off your friend's CDs... cause music's in the sky... Imagine all the people, waiting for a record to actually be released!  Imagine it only lasts 2 minutes and 15 seconds, and then you pick up the needle and place it at the beginning and it starts all over again!  Imagine rushing home from school, because they Beatles are going to be on Shindig that night... Imagine no Blue Ray... or no DVDs too... no way to record them, but just enjoy the moment... and WAIT until next time they come on... in three months...    Buy these, please, I did!  And intellectualize. Fantasize all you want.  'Till then, enjoy these until Apple releases them AGAIN, same songs, \\"IMPROVED SOUND(!!!)\\" as soon as they roll out their \\"DIRECT Amygdala-Injection\\" system in the year 2525 (Zagger & Evans' reference).    There are people out there, writing on blogs, magazines... making comparisons, and actually asking, \\"which was THAT one?\\" and when they are told, \\"THAT was the REMASTERED one\\" they then say: \\"oh, yeah, wow, that IS better!\\"      Wine tasting...if they TELL you it \\"tastes red,\\" it does!  \\"Redder DOES taste more red than regular red!\\"      Please.  DO BUY THESE!!! STEREO AND MONO!!!    Because, the MORE you buy, the HIGHER the probability that they will ACTUALLY release that new, \\"Remastered, remixed\\" print of \\"Let it Be,\\" with the \\"30 minutes of BONUS footage!\\"  And it comes in 17 versions!  And one is blue!    \\"...and the fool on the hill...\\"
0739367676|3.0|It's ridiculous when some want to compare Meyer with J. K. Rowling.  There is no comparison which this fourth book of the series points out with great clarity.
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|I watched this movie with my mom. She kept complaining that she couldn't tell what was going on. I watched and saw it all perfectly.It works like this. Some people can't handle a movie with a nonstop shaking camera, while others can. If you can, than you are a step closer to liking this movie. Anyway, I thought this movie was good. The monster was cool looking and it was all well done.
0393316041|5.0|Feynman had no desire for fame and fortune and was just interested in finding things out.  That's what makes this book so entertaining.  It shows that there is no value in pretending to be an expert or in holding a high position in your field of endeavor without just having fun learning and experiencing life.  While Feynman was truely a great mathmatician and physicist and co-developer of the atomic bomb during WWII, this book shows some of his more human reactions and vulnerabilities we all share.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|this book was so unexpected but so engaging. the story line kept me reading until i finished. i would recommend this book to everyone
B0024FAG62|2.0|I love this film...alway's have and   I think Linda Hunt is great..The film score for the blu-ray release is way over done and just interrupts the story....you have to keep turning down your receiver   I hate that such a fun film is like this, the only other film that has music that gets in the way is Ronin.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|I guess we all have to present our bona fides in doing these reviews. I have listened to AIC since around the time Man in the Box was released as a single, and by 1993 they were far and away my favorite band.  As a reviewer on another site mentioned, Alice was always a bit like \\"metal's answer to The Band.\\"  AIC always covered a lot of territory sonically - the same band did Would?, I Stay Away, The Nothing Song, Am I Inside, Heaven Inside, Queen of the Rodeo, etc.  That was the key to their greatness.  Every album was an adventure, and it always took several plays to peel back the layers and wrap your head around what was going on.  I still find little moments on their self titled album that I hadn't noticed after 14 years.     So what is different today?  Obviously, Layne is no longer with us.  As one of THE voices of 90s rock, filling that void presented one of music's Everests.  I won't belabor the point as it has been pretty well ground in to dirt at this point.  Layne Staley was a huge part of this band, and his loss left behind a great chasm.  A less talked about point I think is that the band always was constantly evolving.  One stroll through The Music Bank box set reveals a band that never rested in one place for too long.  There has always been an archetypal AIC sound, but it has always been more of a common thread from album to album than a complete tapestry.  There is simply no telling what this band may have sounded like, even if Layne had not died, after a 14 year gap in their body of work.  Jerry Cantrell's own solo efforts, Bogey Depot and Degradation Trip, leave the best clues.  One must keep in mind that these were solo albums because AIC couldn't get in a room for years.  Cantrell simply had little choice but to go it alone if he wished to put out material in these years.  While Black Gives Way to Blue preserves the thread, you can hear a bit of Jerry's solo albums on BGWTB as well.  It isn't surprising, nor do I think it should be a negative.  Had AIC done material during this period, it might have sounded very similar.    My favorite thing about Black Gives Way to Blue is how it nods to the vocals of the past without lingering there.  William DuVall is very much his own person, and I like that the band has left him room to be that person.  While Jerry's vocals are maybe a bit more prominent, William plays an invaluable role.  His final, protracted high vocal on \\"Private Hell\\" is one of my favorite moments on the album, and his snarl on \\"Last of My Kind\\" fits perfectly.  Throughout, his harmonies play an excellent counterpoint to Jerry's vocals, which should be noted are stronger than they have ever been.  Most importantly, the interplay between their voices sounds natural and soulful.  DuVall is not Layne Staley, but who could have been?  I like that the band went for a different kind of voice from a little known musician than hiring a name to mimic Layne.  I am excited to see what future material may sound like with DuVall handling more of the lead vocals.  The fact he plays guitar is a nice asset to add as well.    Without running through every song, \\"Private Hell\\", \\"Black Gives Way to Blue\\", \\"Check My Head\\", and \\"Your Decision\\" are worth the price of admission alone.  \\"Private Hell\\" would be at home on the last Alice and Chains album and probably has the most Staley-esque vocals on the album.  However, I don't think this was simply trying to fake Layne.  Sooner or later while listening to this album, one comes to the conclusion that this is just how AIC sounds.  Cantrell's solo stuff never came this close to sounding like Alice, at least to me.  \\"Black Gives Way to Blue\\" is a lovely goodbye to Layne, and the way the song ends leaves a catch in my throat after many listens.  The whole album, from the opener \\"All Secrets Known\\" to the eerie \\"When the Sun Rose Again\\", is great.  I still can't quite believe I just bought a new AIC album!    So Alice in Chains has found themselves in the position of AC/DC when it comes to singers.  It's one thing to lose such distinct voices over personal disputes or break-ups.  It's quite another when they unfortunately pass before their time.  And like post-Bon Scott AC/DC, there will be some fans who, I believe a bit selfishly, will never accept an AIC without Layne Staley.  That is as unfortunate as it is inevitable.  However, for the rest of us who understand why Mike, Sean, and Jerry might have wanted to give it another go, I think they have done the very best any of us could have hoped for.  Black Gives Way to Blue is great cover to cover and pays respect to the past without wallowing in it.  In fact, I hear a good bit of future on this album, and I hope AIC does too.
B000007WNN|4.0|the cult,s 1987 release[electric]was the follow up to their 1985 release called [love].with electric the cult decided to go with a more straight ahead harder rocking sound and with rick rubin producing they did this with flying colors!!the album cover is also another one of the coolest in rock.in my opinion the great cuts are;wild flower,lil devil,electric ocean,love removal machine,outlaw,bad fun,born to be wild and king contrary man.as a cult fan i would definately get this!!!i hope they eventually release the extended version of love removal machine which was a 12 inch single release in 1987 and the extended version is great!!
B000W1V5VU|4.0|The movie itself is great.  Otherwise I wouldn't have ordered it. However, when the movie arrived, I heard what sounded like the actual DVD  sliding around inside the case.  When I opened up the case, the center spindle that holds the movie in place was broken out.  Not too happy with Amazon about this.  Fortunately, the disc was not damaged.  I am unable to store the movie safely in the case it came in.
B0000085N4|4.0|the cult,s sonic temple released in 1989 was the follow up to their electric album from 1987.by the time the cult started recording sonic temple the line up that made electric had fragmented,the core of the group was still intact which was billy duffy guitarist,ian astbury singer and jamie stewart bassist and keyboards, decided to create a new album which would accentuate the best points of love and electric and with producer bob rock they did this very well!!for the tour for sonic temple the cult hired future guns,n,roses and velvet revolver drummer matt sorum.the album cover for sonic temple is another one of the coolest in rock!!!for me the great cuts are;sun king,fire woman,new york city,automatic blues,wake up time for freedom,medicine train,sweet soul sister and soldier blue!!this is a great album!!!there was also a 12 inch single extended version of fire woman released in 1989 that is great. i hope they will rerelease these extended versions!!
B000003TAW|5.0|Weezer is good band who has produced a few really good albums and one incredible one. This is the incredible one.    All ten tracks are sing a long garage band masterpieces, and I haven't yet met anyone who doesn't like this album. You would have to really hate rock music to not like this one. In fact, you might have to hate America not to like it. It is that good.
B0015AARJI|4.0|It's a wireless (bluetooth) controller, but it requires a USB cable to charge and initially sync, which is not included. Not a big deal, since it's just a standard mini USB, but it was cheap of them not to include one.
B000000WJZ|5.0|Siamese Dream is the best Smashing Pumpkins album. Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness is a close second, and is also a classic, but Siamese Dream is special. Every song is amazing, except for the last two, which are just there to allow your mind to recover from being blown 10 times. The album is full of infectious melodies, layers and layers of guitar fills and solos, intros, outros, interludes, and amazing drums. Even the lyrics are great (they actually seem to have a point unlike with some other alternative bands of the era), and Billy Corgan sounds better on this record than on any of his others.   I would put this one in the top ten albums of the nineties, which is saying something.
0446402397|5.0|Wow! I enjoyed this murder mystery much more than I thought I would! It was a very thrilling adventure with an intricate, tightly-woven plot. I don't usually enjoy books set in Russia/U.S.S.R./Soviet Union but this one was just terrific! The characters were richly drawn and quite believable in their motivations. It was simply wonderful, with interesting sub-themes dealing with communism and the state of government. All in all, it was not only exciting, but thought-provoking as well.
B000QEIORG|3.0|The Foo Fighters are not the best band in the world. In fact, they don't even make the top 20 bands from the 90s in my opinion, BUT they do occasionally come up with some solid rock music that can get me through when I'm bored of listening to the \\"classics.\\"   I haven't heard the last couple of Foo Fighters albums, but this is the best one I've listened to. Everlong is a really good song, and My Hero is another. If this was a tribute to Kurt Cobain, it was a pretty good one.
B0006OBPTA|5.0|I ordered this 4 DVD set for my grandchildren because they had never seen or heard of The Karate Kid.  The service from Amazon.com was great; they were delivered within 2 days and the DVD's are first rate and great quality.  I would definitely recommend this product.
B001GCUNW6|2.0|My disappointment is as simple as that.  They want you to purchase two DVDs by releasing the 3D in the future.
0307716988|5.0|Excellent story, I was completely drawn into it. I appreciate Michael even more now for sharing his gift with us and also for being a good person. There will never be another like him, he is one of a kind.
0385504225|2.0|I enjoyed the Da Vinci code, but more for the mystery and the plot line than the characters.  Strangely, in that book, it was not Langdon's character that caught my minds eye, but rather the french police woman, Sophie(?).  \\"The Lost Symbol\\" fails in my opinion in both plot and character development.  By the time I finished this book I was just begging for it to be over.  Character dialogue (both spoken and silent) is stiff, unrealistic, and VERY cliche.  This results in characters with no depth, or complexity.  There wasn't a realistic character in the bunch. The wandering, almost stream-of-consciousness, plot-line was never well defined.  When the story finally revealed the nature of the \\"National Security emergency\\" which drove the Inoue Sato character, I found myself physically shaking my head thinking \\"I turned hundreds of pages, for THIS!?\\".  In the end, this book was filled with example after example of similarly disappointing \\"eureka moments\\" that gave me the same empty feeling.  Read it if you must, but temper your expectations.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|The product was in excellent condition. It was delivered to me very speedily. Very good price in comparison with local businesses.
B000K7VHQE|2.0|I guess I just don't understand why people seem to so enjoy portrayals of hideous dysfunction in families.  I found this movie to be so awful that I couldn't even make it through the dinner scene to finish the rest of what I think was probably more of the same:  scenes of a family that is ridiculously screwed up.  Why do people like this kind of cr*p?  Isn't there enough garbage to see out there in our day-to-day world?  So sue me, I didn't watch the whole thing, but I couldn't stomach anymore of the nastiness.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|Soooo glad I bought Season 1. I'm catching up as I watch Season 2 on tv. Great show, great acting, great times :)
B0037XPP84|4.0|I'm not sure why this film has been so maligned. I have not seen the first film \\"Elizabeth\\" with Cate Blanchett and this director, so I cannot compare the two. I can confirm that watching the blu-ray of \\"Elizabeth:The Golden Age\\" is a beautiful experience. Blanchett is stunning as the queen and the range of her queenly and womanly emotions during a very tricky historical time is very impressive. The costumes are heavenly, the sets outrageously detailed and beautiful, and the Craig Armstrong score is lush and memorable. While some argue, and rightly so, that the film is historically inaccurate, I disregard those complaints and sit back and enjoy a very good film that takes me back to the time period in question. I'm very glad that this is part of my collection.
B0024F08RO|5.0|loved that season 4 brought everything together and made sense of the first 3 seasons
B00005QGAZ|5.0|I love the album!  My only gripe is in the delivery of it.  The casing was cracked on one side so the packaging could've been better.  All the songs were great; I liked all of them.  I especially liked the fact that there were extra tracks on the album.  Who would ever think that Vincent Price would say \\"Can you dig it\\". Brings back some good memories.  Upon hearing this album, you can see why it's considered the greatest album of all time.  Michael's passing is so sad.  I'm still in shock almost 4 months later.  His music will never die; he will truly be missed and always loved.
B0007GAEGC|2.0|the album was a huge letdown, i will not purchase any more albums from this group.
0061339202|4.0|Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience is an excellent read. When I first got this book, I had no idea what it was about. I figured that it would be a look into psychological ideals and I was about half correct. The book ended up being more of a self help book; a way to make one's life better and deeper. The idea of Optimal Experience is a hard one to envision, but after reading the book I definitely understand more about myself and my own life. The book is one that turns inspection inward and causes the reader to take stock of how he/she works in this world. Ideas expressed in the book include how to achieve happiness at work and within all things in one's life. If I had to sum the whole thing up in a few words, I would say that it is a book about how to be happy. It uses several psychological studies to prove just how happiness can be achieved. This may end up being a self help book, but it does not give a step by step formula for how to achieve happiness. It simply lays the ground work for the reader to take control and find happiness on their own. I found that I could relate to a lot of the topics that were covered, and that the more a read, the more I understood about myself. The book itself is well written, though it can be a little up tight at times. It was a slow read for me because of the volume of information that it contains. One has to read it slowly and pay attention, or he/she will miss out on some of the main points. It is difficult at times to follow what Csikszentmihalyi is saying, but after re-reading certain parts I came to understand. I read this book for a college course, and I am glad that I did. It focuses on ideas that can help a person better themselves and those around them. I believe everyone should read this book at least once in their lifetime, even out of pure boredom.As the book states, It offers steps toward enhancing the quality of life, and everyone should have the chance to improve something about themselves.
B0029O08WA|3.0|So...The CD is growing on me the more that I listen...but I'm not completely gaga over it. The lyrics all perfectly fit the book, which it should because they were written for the movie. The music has some really good beats. The sound of the singers is what makes me turn my nose up. They all sound the same and at times sound like they're singing in a montone manner. There wasn't any variety. I know that New Moon is much more mellow, but there are some happy moments, and happy moments should be complemented with happy music or something not as depressing. I loved the playlists stephenie meyer comprised. In fact the new moon playlists were my favorite out of the all the playlists she posted on her website. So it is disappointing that I don't love the soundtrack.       Also, I didn't realize all the music was indie. I guess indie is just not my thing. Even so, some balance should have been struck between indie and american music. Im hopiong the movie is better and the music on the soundtrack fits in the movie.
B0029O08WA|5.0|This album is full of great music, but before buying it you should know that the album as a whole has a very somber tone in keeping with the book. This should be obvious, but after reading the negative reviews it is apparent that some people were expecting the same upbeat sound that was found in the Twilight soundtrack. The album, overall, captures the feel of the book very well and makes me that much more anxious for the movie.    In short, consider the fact that the album's purpose is to follow the storyline of the book before deciding that it is simply a terrible collection of music.
1601251505|5.0|As the ad says, 3.5 thrives. Paizo has outdone themselves with the whole Pathfinder set. We've been playing one of the 6 book adventure paths over the last year and have had lots of fun!<br /><br />The core rulebook is just fantastic.

B000YD7S26|4.0|I would like to add some comments for those who are particularly interested in the video and sound quality of this DVD.  I have been fortunate to attend a concert of the Vienna Philharmonic performing the Bruckner Eighth.  The VPO has this music in their blood, but it takes some coaxing from the conductor for them to give a really special performance, otherwise they can sound like they are on auto-pilot (like at the performance I attended, the conductor of which shall remain nameless).    As another reviewer stated, the video quality is so-so on these DVD's.  This is especially true for the Bruckner Eighth, which looks like it was sourced from an nth generation video tape.  The picture is murky and there is very noticeable video noise and scan line artifacting (it is similar to VHS quality).  In addition, the audio, while not as distractingly bad, lacks clarity and dynamics.  There is very little sense that the orchestra is performing in the cathedral that they are in, which one would think should add a nice reverberation and bloom to the music.  Whether due to the mediocre recording quality or Karajan's conducting that day, this performance of Bruckner's Eighth, which was one of Karajan's favorite pieces, doesn't quite catch fire for me.  A real disappointment. If you are fairly new to Bruckner, you are better off acquiring one of Karajan's CD's for this piece.    The good news is that the picture and sound are significantly better on the second disc which holds the Ninth Symphony and the Te Deum.  While still not ideally clear, the recording in this case is not bad enough to detract from the performance.  These performances were done in a concert hall rather than a church, and for whatever reason, the sound has much better dynamics.  I found the performance of the Ninth Symphony to be very exciting, and the Te Deum was thrilling as well.  The DVD does not make it clear whether the Te Deum was done at the same performance as the Symphony, but Bruckner did suggest that it serve as a possible finale to the Ninth (which he never completed).  On the DVD, the Te Deum follows the symphony, and one notices that it doesn't quite work as a finale, partly due to its being in an inappropriate key.  Interestingly, Karajan totally changes his conducting style for the Te Deum, eschewing a baton and keeping his eyes clearly open (he tends to conduct serious works with his eyes closed).    By the way, don't miss the \\"trailer\\" on the first disc.  It is actually a generous helping of extended excerpts from other Karajan DVD's, lasting almost a full hour!  I found the von Suppe, Wagner, and Tchaikovsky Fourth excerpts most entertaining.  This almost made up for the disappointment of the Eighth Symphony.
0307277453|4.0|A little uneven in parts, this book still offers some near-overwhelming gems of evolutionary history. The greatest for me was the discussion and exploration of the experiments that showed how colonies of single-celled organisms could, when their environment changed through the introduction of a 'predatory' microbe, adapt to form multi-celled bodies, first with hundreds of cells, before evolving to a more stable and liveable eight-celled arrangement. When transplanted to a new environment, the eight-celled arrangement continued to be produced.<br /><br />Awesome.
0385504225|1.0|It is hard to believe that a book with so much hype can be so bad.  The plot starts with a repeat of The Davinci Code - Robert Langdon running around with an attractive female, solving unintelligible puzzles that make no sense whle being 'chased' by a bad guy - the big difference is that he is bald instead of albino.  Now that is the good news - the bad news is that there is a plethora of 'who cares' stuff constantly being brought up regarding the Masons and the search for 'truth'.  Along the way there's gobbly-gook about noetic science that is incomprehensible.  All of this would be tolerable but the actions of the USG agents makes no sense which allows Langdon and then the bad guy to escape again and again.  The final scene (which is actually 30 pages before the ending of the book) where the bad guy meets his end is just downright silly and the world is saved as an afterthought.  The 30 page epilogue is a sermon on truth, justice and the American way.  I JUST CAN'T WAIT FOR THE MOVIE!!!  On the positive side, there's no way it can be worse than the book.
0743289692|5.0|The best kind of autobiography: the kind that gives you perspective on ways of life that you never knew existed, let alone knew how much of an impact they could have on you. Hirsi Ali is a liberal pragmatist, with a truer understanding of liberty than almost every other politician I've heard say two words together.<br /><br />It's unfortunate to think that Hirsi Ali's atheism may dissuade people from touching this book, especially since the kind of people who would actually be dissuaded by her personal beliefs on God are more than likely those with the most desperate need for a refresher course on the ideal of liberty.<br /><br />For those with such reservations, I would recommend at least reading up to the point at which she enters The Netherlands, as the preceding pages will at least offer some startling and unforgettable insights into Islam, east African culture, political Islamisation, the civil wars of the region and their practical impact on its citizens, religious fundamentalism, and the treatment of women.<br /><br />These in themselves are more than enough to make this book a more than worthwhile read, especially for those whose sole purpose in picking up a book is to gain additional context for the world around them.

B000G6R7B8|4.0|I love the retro design, more logical reading, and that's the reason I brough it.  The first one I received runs 20 min. faster every hour! That's 4 hours faster everyday! The seller fairly replaced a new one quickly.  The new one still runs about 15 sec. faster everyday, not too bad though. I wish it could has the Kinetic movement.
0060531053|5.0|I have had this book for more than 6 years.  I got it with a birthday present of a home brew kit.  Have been brewing beer & winning ribbons the last 4 years.  I have pages marked that I refer to completely.  This book has so much GREAT & Useful well-organized information. The charts are well layed out make for great references.  The pages are worn & some wort spilled on the  Specific Gravity charts.  You will actually use the book again & again.  Would highly recommend to the the beginner & intermediate person.
0151013837|5.0|I loved Life of Pi and read it when it came out. I recently found this illustrated hard copy and had to have it!  I love it! The illustrations are colorful and give the story another dimension. Very Nice!
B0026IQFS0|4.0|A bit of a tough start.  I would recommend anyone getting started in this series to do a little research on naval history and warfare of the era.  It will help with understanding the action.
B00164GDD2|4.0|I'm not a high-def expert, but the rendition of the movie seemed good to me, I didn't notice any issues, allowing me to focus on the movie. It was great to catch up with this movie just like an old friend. It's still very funny and a bit spooky. Bill Murray is just great but the whole cast works together very well, even the lady hired to answer the phone at Ghostbusters HQ.
B0029O08WA|4.0|If obscurity defines Indie Rock than this soundtrack epitomizes that genre, because top 40 it is not. The music is good, and artistically complex (except for Li -I don't get how she got on this album), but in comparison to the first soundtrack it's a 180 and not really geared toward the demographic you would expect. A much more somber album reflective of the storyline.
B001FB4VZS|5.0|This season was great.  One is kept on their toes throughout each episode.  The writers are keeping each one fresh.
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|I wasn't really sure what to expect from this CD but I was very pleasantly surprised and really like it. My husband had missed out on most of this music as he was very involved in medical school during the explosion of the Beatles. He loved this CD. Definitely recommended.
B001YV5068|3.0|It doesn't quite come off thanks to Spike Lee's heavy-handed cutting.  The premise is farfetched but could carry an entertaining film if handled well.  After all, this is not a documentary.  Instead, Lee threw in numerous flash-forwards that partly give away the ending.  He would have had a better film had he kept them in chronological order.  Lee obviously wanted more of it.  The disc's special features contain a lengthy series of quickstep police interviews that mercifully hit the cutting room floor.  One flash-forward even details events that never occur, which only serves to confuse.    As to Jodie Foster, her character was well acted - as expected - but never seemed relevant or believable.  Where does her power come from?  We never learn that.  Police will not permit a civilian to enter a deadly situation in the manner in which this film portrays, if ever.  Yes, the mayor was pulling the strings because Lee always has to include an establishment conspiracy.  Even in Malcolm X, where we know the killers were disgruntled Muslims, he has to have a police car slide by at the eleventh hour to imply conspiracy.  There were other ways of dealing with the Christopher Plummer character's nefarious dealings with the Nazis.    Last, there is Lee's penchant for using the \\"F\\" word as often as possible.  I know what the reaction will be from all of you who can't live without using it three times in every sentence, but it only detracts from the film.  It's just a thrown-in word to . . . What?  Shock?  Hardly by this time.  Just annoy those of us whose vocabularies exceed street level.  Critic Wesley Morris said that Lee instills the film \\"with grit, comedy, and a ton of New York ethnic personality.\\"  If so, New York is not a nice place to visit, and I sure wouldn't want to live there.  Do people say the word?  Of course.  Does it add to the film's realism?  You premise a film on a farfetched plot and then want to swear to add realism?  Justifying the \\"F\\" word as a tool of realism is an excuse producers use to appeal to a younger, more vocabulary-challenged moviegoer.
B0029O08WA|5.0|This soundtrack has me so excited to see the film as it seems to be a great fit.  Awesome & detailed analysis by Phoenix Child just says it all.   I hadn't heard of the majority of these artists, but agree that every song is incredible.  Based on what I read and perceive of \\"New Moon\\", the songs are a perfect fit.   I'm happy that it doesn't similar to the \\"Twilight\\" track.   Love the fact that I'm widening my listening experiences and being introduced to artists that I would never have listened to before.  Like Phoenix Child, I too feel that the \\"creme de la creme of the collection\\" is the original score by Alexandre Desplat.   Recommend the purchase and also the iTunes with the bonus selections!
B000003CUJ|5.0|I love listening to the orchestral music of Richard Wagner because it is extremely powerful and moving and Wagner is one of the masters of the gradual emotional buildup and release. I have quite a few recordings of Wagner's orchestral music, overtures and preludes but the one I end up coming back most often to is The Ring Without Words. Music from the Ring is incredible and no lyrics are needed here, regardless how poetic and gentle the language could have sounded. I find this recording to be of a very good quality of tone and I really like the arrangements which sort of compiles it all nicely. Ring Without Words is my favorite tale of the story told.
B001MSN8VW|5.0|Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game is a great science fiction novel that is worth reading. When I read the book for a school assignment, I expected to read up until page 45 since our homework assignment only required us to read until there. Instead, I read the while book in one sitting, staying up late to finish the book. After that, I read the book again! It's that good! Orson Scott Card does a tremendous job making this novel exciting.  Ender's Game us about a boy named Ender who is the third child in the family, or a Third. Since there is a limit on the number of children a family can have, the undesirable Thirds were born for the government to use as soldiers and commanders. Ender, a very intelligent child, is picked and forced to train at Battle School, where children are made into soldiers and commanders, The teachers of this school make life difficult for him, driving him into isolation. He fights for respect and for leadership. Ender shows everyone else how good he is in to battleroom, his game. Everybody knows that he is their only hope to save mankind from the buggers, aliens that are coming to destroy Earth and all of humanity. There had been two invasion before, but with more buggers, the hero of the second invasion gone, and Ender who has no idea how the great Mazer Rackham defeated the buggers in the Second Invasion, can Ender do it? Will he save those he loves and his home? With more trouble added to his plate: students that want to kill Ender, the game getting harder, can Ender even survive? Will he break?
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|2007 was a bad year for Britney. all her crazy antics just turned people away from her including myself. even though i'm not a big fan of britney, her album blackout was really good even though it didn't have much success. blackout is in the zone pt. 2 with the partying and lustful themes. of all the albums she had released in the past, i definitely think that this is her best. you could tell that on each album, she improves a little.<br /><br />1.gimme more-great intro \\"it's britney bitch\\". she performed this song at the 07 vmas which turned out to be a disastrous and embarrassing performance. despite all that, i enjoy the song and it did well on the charts. 5/5<br /><br />2.piece of me- this is my favorite song off the album. the lyrics are catchy especially the chorus. it's cute and sarcastic in a way where she pokes fun at herself. \\"I'm Miss Media Karma\\". 5/5<br /><br />3.radar- reminds me of soft cell's \\"tainted love\\". great throwback. 5/5<br /><br />4.break the ice-didn't like the intro but the song sounds good eventually. 4/5<br /><br />5.heaven on earth-sounds pretty 80ish/beverly hills like. 4/5<br /><br />6.get naked- this song would have sound better without the weird, creepy voice in the background. it's like hearing sounds from hell. 2/5<br /><br />7.freakshow- i like the beats. sounds pretty bouncy. 4/5<br /><br />8.toy soldier-cute pop song with a nice little drumbeat. 5/5<br /><br />9.hot as ice- the beats sound like the circus...crazy, silly, and freakish. it's a fun song but her vocals get kinda annoying toward the end. 4.5/5<br /><br />10.ooh ooh baby- did they used a sample in this song. the beats sounds kinda familiar but i don't know the name of it. i like really the guitars. 5/5<br /><br />11.perfect lover- it's very seductive and sensual. 4/5<br /><br />12.why should i be sad-this is another favorite of mines. \\"hey baby...what's your name?\\". i like that easygoing vibe here. it sounds very different from the rest of her songs on here. 5/5
B001493FK8|4.0|Ah, the first offering in the legendary Song of Ice and Fire series.<br /><br />The first thing one should keep in mind is that ol' George Martin isn't a stickler for the \\"the good guys triumph over evil!\\" formula that is oft encountered in most fantasy yarns. With that said, I'm going to try to give you a look see into this without giving out too many spoilers. ^^;;<br /><br />\\"Is it well worth it?\\" you might ask. The short answer is \\"Yes!\\" Martin pulls us into the land of Westeros and the Seven Kingdoms, demonstrating astounding knowledge in all things medieval-ish. The standard fantasy staples, such as dragons, elves, wizards and the like are conspicuously absent for the most part, taking us into a world not unlike our own past.<br /><br />And, there are plots within. And, you'll think things will work out one way for sure, but don't even try to make any predictions, as what you guessed will totally go into a direction that you'd have never thought.<br /><br />Yes, it is epic. And dark.<br /><br />Also, the very end of the novel includes a handy-dandy appendix, which describes the assorted houses and factions that are aligned, and against, each other. Though with that said, I think I would have preferred these to be at the book's start. Still, a minor complaint in the grand scheme of things.<br /><br />The world of Ice and Fire has characters that you will love, or at least love to hate. And when you too venture into the world of Ice and Fire, you'll know exactly what I mean!<br /><br />So, won't you dive on in, and play the Game of Thrones?
B000UJCALI|5.0|You know one way you can tell that this is a great movie? It's been popular consistently for over two decades.  It's tough to make a great horror movie. Most of them come out and then instantly fade away and a year later no one remembers them. Who will remember \\"The Ruins\\" and \\"Prom Night\\" a year from now? I started forgetting them twenty minutes after I saw them. One had something to do with singing plants and the other was probably about a prom and mostly likely took place at night.  The Shining is one of those movies that have become so ingrained in our culture that if you haven't seen it you really miss out on a lot of other things as this movie is still referenced constantly. Even commercials would be hard to \\"get\\" without seeing this. I mean, just a few months ago there was some cellphone commercial that featured the twin girls from The Shining haunting a cellular \\"dead zone\\".    What makes this movie so great is that it's not just a Halloween hack-n-slash. There is a plot and they spend time building up to the insanity, so that you get drawn into the characters and actually care what happens to them. The actors, the music, the directing. Everything comes together in this movie.  If you haven't seen this, you need to.
B001UREJWM|4.0|The fact that Sabbath did some of it's best work with Ronnie James Dio at the helm lends some credibility to this effort.  Iommi and Dio just seem to click here and you can feel that the bad blood of the past is long since dead.  They create a mood together and it is dark, sludgy, and driven.  Keeping the Heaven & Hell moniker from their reunion tour a few years back, Dio, Iommi, Butler and Appice come out with a record of all new material, and, no big surprise, it rocks deeply and darkly.  If we are to be picky, we will say that Dio's sings very slow on some songs, as if he's trying to emphasize every single word, and that is slightly annoying.  We could say that there are parts where Iommi trains us in repetition to the point of driving us away.  We could say those things and still respect what The Devil You Know represents, which is a classic Sabbath crew getting back together to rock the world.  They're getting old (RJD is 67, Iommi is 61, Geezer is 60, Vinny is 50)but these are the Godfathers Of Metal, so they know what their doing and we trust them wholeheartedly.  They do not disappoint, nor do they try to feed us some fake, song-doctored metal crap.  The wall of sound feel from the opening riffs of The Devil You Know is a pleasant return to the days of apocalyptic Sabbath.  Let's check out the tracks:<br /><br />Atom And Evil:  Great opening track.  Dio's lyrics are clever and memorable.  The gloom and doom of Iommi & Butler is mind blowing.  You cannot believe that these dude are old enough to be our parents or our grandparents.  These guys know how to rock all the way.  Very polished effort.  The production is heavy but very clear.<br /><br />Fear:  Great riff, very ponderous beat.  Dio is rocking on all cylinders with his vocals.  Lyrics are tight.  This is exactly why we buy the album when these guys get back together.  It rocks!<br /><br />Bible Black:  Moody acoustic intro.  You can tell right away that all egos have been put aside finally.  This is a band having a good time and rocking out. Excellent song. Don't go on, put it back, you're reading from the Bible Black....<br /><br />Double The Pain:  Geezer intro, pounding, groovy.  A stab in the back is worth waiting for tonight...  RJD is definitely not writing about rainbows and dragons anymore and we miss that from time to time, but this bitter, edgy stuff is great, too.<br /><br />Rock And Roll Angel:  Ronnie sings way too slow here to emphasize the words and that kinda shows us the imprefections in his aging voice, but aside from that, this is another great tune.  The Sabs clicked on this effort and it shows on every song. The solo is hearty and straight-forward.  This isn't shredding, this is playing from the gut. The acoustic blurbs at the end of this song are awesome. Iommi sounds revitalized.<br /><br />The Turn Of The Screw:  This song sounds familiar and that is probably just the signature Sabbath sound recurring.  This song drags a little because of Dio's vocals.  Musically it shreds. Very heavy, very Sabbath.  You'll be rich, you'll be golden, just sign on the dotted line...<br /><br />Eating The Cannibals:  Damn, this song just shoots out of the gate shredding.  Rocker!  Sabbath revitalized.  The lyrics are nonsense but this is one of the bright spots on a very consistent album.  Excellent!<br /><br />Follow The Tears:  I love the opening riff, it's Metallica-esque, like something off Justice.  The drums roll in and it is something off of Justice.  Damn!  Powerful stuff.  The rolling, drowning wall of sound might drain your soul after a while, but this is a great song to pop in and pit the headphones on and lose yourself in the darkness. Iommi's playing (hell, all the playing here) is inspired.  Something has been rekindled and it could possible be great for a few more years to come.  We take our Sabbath in meassured increments or where we can get it.<br /><br />Neverwhere:  This deep into the album, you would expect the filler to start flowing.  Not the case here at all.  This song is one of the better songs on the album.  Dio's vocals belt out like machine gun fire.  Driven.  Wow.  Very impressive.<br /><br />Breaking Into Heaven:  This sounds like reheated Dehumanizer when you hear the doom flow forth.  This song drags.  Ominous but dragging.  Not going to be anyone's favorite song.  This may be filler.  Maybe.  Very Sabbath.  Very heavy.  Almost too heavy, like it's crushing the life out of you as you listen to it.<br /><br />Overall, I wasn't expecting much out of this reunion.  I saw them live with Megadeth opening and I can tell you without remorse that the was one of the greatest shows I have ever seen in my life.  Dio hit every single note and to see the Sabs up there doing the great Heaven & Hell/Mob Rules songs again.  Excellent.  Like I said, I wasn't expecting much from this.  The few songs they did for The Dio Years were blah & depressing, but I was pleasantly surprised by this entire album.  There are a few dragging spots and Dio's voice (am I actually saying this?) gets ponderous here and there but Iommi plays like he just got a tranfusion of demonic blood.  Geezer and Vinny are solid as alway.  RJD is amazing for the fact that he's 67 years old!  Amazing!  This is an iconic bunch of guys that still know how to put out the metal.  Nothing felt cheap or contrived here.  Honest.  Dark.  Clever. Consistent. Metal.<br /><br />Dig it!<br /><br />Postscript:  Sadly, this was to be Ronnie's final recording.  He passed away May 16th, 2010 after his bout with stomach cancer.  The world is a lesser place without him.  I had the honor of meeting Ronnie several times over the past 20+ years, hanging out and actually talking with him and I can say, without a doubt, he was a true gentleman and a legend.  From his early beginnings in do-wop with Ronnie & The Red Caps all the way through Elf, Rainbow, Black Sabbath & Dio, Ronnie's contribution to music was immense.  He will be truly missed.  R.I.P.

B0002O7XW2|5.0|I won't waste your time repeating for the one thousandth time what the plot of the movie is. That is not what reviews are for.    This movie seems stupid, but it's not. I avoided this film up until five years ago when I saw it on a lark, fully expecting it to be a complete waste of time. Man, was I wrong. The movie is actually surprisingly entertaining.    There is nothing better than the scene where someone is trying to get into the car and she starts playing \\"I hear you knockin', but you can't come in\\" on the radio. Genius.
B002GZQYMK|5.0|I have to thank Adam lambert for enlightening me to Muse.This CD is fabulous; lots of different sounds; if you like something in the classical genre, then you have to check this CD out.  Muse definitely rocks!!
B001TH16DI|4.0|Just a few words: a must for all trekkies! Great picture quality and pretty good sound. Long live the original series!
0385504225|3.0|I guess after reading Da Vinci Code, love that book.  This book read like a movie script, I saw Tom Hanks running from scene to scene.  It wasn't as compelling as Da Vinci.  But I also enjoyed some of the facts, I didn't know.
B002KQOCJ2|5.0|Well, I'm not going to get into songs description each by each because there are other reviews that get into that. I'm just going to say that this is a great comeback from such a great band considering that a very very important member is dead, so hands down for such a fine return to the music business. Although I'm more than happy with the album, and after analizing a few things I still consider that DuVall deserved more lead singing on BGWTB eventhough I'm sure that that will happen in future efforts, I mean, lets let the lead singer sings. Jerry sings great too, but DuVall is not in the band just to harmonize with Cantrell.    The vinyl package is great. THE VINYLS ARE CLEAR, what a nice treat when you don't expect it, and heavy too. Gatefold outter sleeve, plain white inners, a lyrics and credits insert and a cd version of the album; WHAT ELSE CAN YOU ASK FOR! A very complete set. And now the sound: clear, powerful and, thank God, free of the \\"loudness war\\" (blame the RIAA); just love it. Just to let you know I used an Audio Technica AT120 stylus, a Sansui SR-838 turntable, a Sansui AU-919 amp and Mordaunt Short speakers to listen to this album.    If you're into vinyl this is one of the few times when everything works and assembles great. Great album, great package and great sound. I would like to add that Amazon delivered in an awesome package. Big box with lots of air plastic pillows to ensure that the item gets to you completely safe; thanks guys.
B002C6K7N0|5.0|This album rocks!!I love it. Great production,musical hooks-still creatively a bit progish.Dave Mustaine is picky about second lead guitarists & it sure pays off especially with this album cause Chris Boderick in my opinion is the untouchable shred king. Dave keeps improving as well & is a shred badass allright!Lyrics are subjective, some may think ''Abominations'' may be more in tune politically/socially, what have you but so what- a damn good job was done here.For me the music comes first & this stuff is superhuman.Get this cd especially if your'e a Megadeth fan,brew a pot of coffee & throw this on & you'll probably go through the ceiling!
B000JJSPXQ|4.0|My 9 year old asked me to order this for the song \\"Listen to Your Heart\\", and discovered cut number 16 \\"Stars\\" now she and her giggling little posse play it non stop THANKS SO MUCH Roxette. I kid, It is a very good CD with a good mix of ballads and uptempo songs.
B001ECQ75A|5.0|This was a good kids movie, it didn't keep the attention of my 2 year old as much as other movies, but I really enjoyed the story and the humor of the movie.  I do think this movie is worthy of a sequel and may have the following similar to Sherk, so I think it is worthy of another storyline.
B002K0WBXW|3.0|Even though it so clearly apes the set-up of David Frankel's [[ASIN:B000J103PC The Devil Wears Prada]], I think the first 25 minutes of this 2009 romantic comedy has genuine snap enhanced by the sharp comedy interplay between stars Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. Once the story leaves the Manhattan publishing house for the pastoral wilderness of Alaska, the story reverts into a formulaic sitcom bearing more than a passing resemblance to Bullock's break-out vehicle, 1995's [[ASIN:6304765266 While You Were Sleeping]], including an escalation of comic deceptions and a heart-tugging wedding confessional. Give credit to the fortyish actress/producer for not giving in too much to standard ing&eacute;nue behavior this time. In fact, she plays the alpha dog with Reynolds relegated to the traditional leading lady role. The result produces enough contrived shenanigans to please Bullock's diehard fans thanks to by-the-numbers work by director Anne Fletcher ([[ASIN:B0015I2RT8 27 Dresses]]) and first-time screenwriter Pete Chiarelli.<br /><br />The storyline has Bullock playing vituperative book editor Margaret Tate, a workaholic careerist who instills fear into her entire office. As her bullied assistant Andrew Paxton, Reynolds caters to her every whim in the hopes that she will help boost his publishing career. As is typical for an opposites-attract rom-com, a complication occurs when Margaret, a Canadian, finds out she is to be deported because her visa application has been denied. Instead of facing immediate termination, she manipulates Andrew to let her superiors know that they are getting married. This moment of desperate deceit leads to an awkward visit with an immigration agent who senses a green-card arrangement and requires proof of their relationship. In order to avert suspicion, Margaret accompanies Andrew to visit his close-knit family in Sitka, Alaska, where it is revealed his family is quite wealthy and in fact, run many of the businesses in town.<br /><br />They continue their charade of being engaged, which of course, fans the flames of his family's enthusiasm for a wedding. The rest of the film is pretty much what you would expect save a strange episode of Andrew's grandmother performing a native dance in the woods. It's funny to see how Bullock cleverly uses the same prickliness she displayed effectively in her near-cameo in Paul Haggis' [[ASIN:B000A3XY5A Crash]] in this film's establishing scenes as Margaret. In turn, Reynolds shows smart timing as put-upon Andrew, and their interplay has a nice edge. Note how well they perform during the best scenes early on when Margaret baldly lies about their upcoming nuptials at the office and in front of the immigration officer. It's just when they move into more traditional rom-com territory where their chemistry feels weakened and the sparks doused. Chiarelli's haphazard screenplay doesn't help them as they have little beyond one bedtime confessional scene to make us think they may belong together. Craig T. Nelson plays a familiar role as Andrew's disapproving father, but their subplot weighs down the proceedings unnecessarily.<br /><br />Except for one brief face-off with Nelson, Mary Steenburgen is wasted as Andrew's always-smiling mother. Betty White is a welcome sight as feisty Grandma Annie, although I wish the creators could have made her more like Sue Ann Nivens ([[ASIN:B001RIYVYK The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]) and less like Rose Nylund ([[ASIN:B0002W4SX6 The Golden Girls]]). As the girl Andrew left behind in Sitka, Malin Akerman ([[ASIN:B001QTXM5Y Watchmen]]) is actually left stranded by the script, while Oscar Nu&ntilde;ez ([[ASIN:B0024FAD9W The Office]]) grows increasingly tiresome as store clerk/male stripper Ramone. His absurd club performance, along with a nude run-in between the principals, just shows how little faith the creators had in the material to sustain the plot. Standard extras come with the 2009 DVD: a decent commentary track from Fletcher and Chiarelli (but sadly not the actors), seven minutes of outtakes, two deleted scenes of little interest, and an alternate ending which really just switches the locale versus the resolution.f outtakes, two deleted scenes of little interest, and an alternate ending which really just switches the locale versus the resolution.
B000TLYEEI|5.0|Spectacular! I have recommended this CD and seller to everyone who listens to it with me. Everything was in perfect condition, and I am very happy that I decided to buy this off of Amazon.

0812932293|5.0|\\"Losing my Virginity\\" is Richard Branson's autobiography and takes you on a pleasent ride all the way from his extraordinary childhood to the growing realms of the Virgin empire. It's really interesting to see how he built it all up from scratch and how he chose his paths in both life and business.    The book also contains the thrilling stories of his adventures as a balloonist and speed-boat daredevil. Really entertaining reading.    Sir Richard Branson is one of those persons I really would like to meet before I die, because he seems to posess such an interesting kind of energy. \\"Losing my Virginity\\" only supports that feeling and sure gave me a boost of that Branson-energy.    I couldn't put this book down after I started reading it.    If you're looking for a book about business, then you should read Branson's \\"Business Stripped Bare\\", but if you want a book more about his life then this book is fantastic.    Highly recommended!
B002LVVCIK|5.0|Throughout his entire career as both an author of very left-leaning missives and a writer/director of subversive documentaries, Michael Moore has been a friend to many, and an enemy to just as many.  Whether it was with ROGER AND ME, BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE, FAHRENHEIT 9/11, or SICKO, Moore has shown that he has the power to enlighten or enrage.  And the same holds true for his latest missive, CAPITALISM: A LOVE STORY.    In CAPITALISM: A LOVE STORY, he goes a step further by putting the argument out there that our system of Capitalism is intrinsically evil.  If he is at all wrong in his assumption, the huge financial storms that rocked both America and the world at large in 2007 and 2008 prove that it isn't by much.  And he offers mountains of evidence to prove his point: a family loses a Peoria, Illinois farmhouse that has been in their possession for forty years due to unforeseen financial circumstances; workers at a Chicago construction firm are out of a job because Bank of America has foreclosed on them.  And this is really the tip of the iceberg.  During the 128 minute running time of CAPITALISM: A LOVE STORY, Moore dissects how that economic concept that has held America's economy in place for so long got out of control, and how the warnings about greed overtaking the system were ignored for the love of money, thanks to the ascension of Ronald Reagan to the presidency, and the beginnings of a trend where there was collusion between our elected representatives and big, faceless, indifferent mega-corporations.  Regulatory rules were tossed out the window in the belief, swallowed whole by the American people during the Reagan and Bush Sr. eras, that wealth would trickle down from the top, a theory known then, as now, as \\"trickle down economics.\\"  Of course, we know now, all too late it would seem, that this was largely smoke and mirrors, for while the richest 5% of Americans got wildly inappropriate tax cuts or tax breaks, the poor and middle class got The Shaft.In a unique twist, Moore, left-leaning though he is, even goes to expose the people within the Clinton Administration who either worked in the Wall Street world either prior to coming into, or after leaving, his administration.  This is more fair-and-balanced than one might anticipate from Moore, and far superior that anything that Fox News could ever conjure up on a good day.    But Moore, good as he is at raising the ire of Americans through his traditional populist rage, also shows us how people can get together and make it very difficult for the corporations to do business in the predatory way that they had been doing it for three decades.  The employees of the Chicago construction firm decide to barricade themselves in their place of employment until Bank of America caves in, which is what happens.  Displaced residents of a foreclosed home in Miami call the bluffs of both the foreclosure agent and their own police department; they too win.  And with all the hoopla that was thrown about by the McCain/Palin GOP presidential ticket and the backwater idiot named Joe The Plumber about how much Barack Obama was somehow a socialist, it shows how the American people at large won, by declaring that they wanted the era of unbridled greed to come to a permanent end, and declaring it where it does the most good--at the Ballot Box.    There are, of course, the usual publicity gags that Moore performs to make his points, the very ones that make him the Right's favorite whipping boy: confronting security guards at the most corrupt mega-banks by driving up to their corporate offices in a Brink's armored truck; surrounding the A.I.G. building in New York City with yellow crime scene tape.  But the points he makes are serious, and worthy of consideration.  The plain truth of the matter is that, under a government-and-business collusion, capitalism in America has gone so far off the rails and cost what was once the richest and most powerful nation in history its prestige, andcost millions of hard-working Americans their jobs, and even their lives.    I don't know that Capitalism should be dismantled altogether, nor do I think it can be, at least not so easily as Moore suggests.  But without resurrecting regulations that protect average people in the future from the kinds of predatory loan practices that caused the near-collapse of our economy, Capitalism may yet have to be put on the ash heap of history.
0385341008|5.0|I loved this book.  I became friends with the Guernsey Islanders and did not want to leave the friendships by finishing the book.  Therefore I strung out the end by reading only two or three of the letters at a time.  The author created images that could lead me to a visit.  There is a good mix of laugh-out- loud humor, character development  and a few reminders of tragedies of wartime.

I recommend this bood to all that are ready for the truth.

Well worth the time and the money paid for the conference.  I would recommend Dr's Chapman's conference to anyone looking to improve communication in marriage.
B0016BPWNM|4.0|This was viewed on a 42\\" Panasonic Plasma, BD35 Player. PQ 4/5(a bit grainy and digitized) and 5/5 for AQ. For an older film this Blu-Ray was a fine upgrade. Jim Henson creates another world of escapism with creative creatures and an engaging storyline. I had not seen this film in many years, but once again the 80's soundtrack and iconic creatures and intro of Jennifer Connelly early in her career was excellent. For fans of this film, the transfer provides a new level of color-rich intensity. Give it a look!
0307473708|1.0|Lindsay is a master of metaphor.  Take the following example from towards the end of the book:            \\"...We had to go, go find him, go find him and stop him.  But how did I do that with Laquerta along for the ride?  I felt like a                   comet with a tail I didn't want.  I took a deep breath.\\"    With that kind of lingual finesse, who needs Hannibal?    I also found it annoying, really jarring, whenever Dexter would say something like, \\"I would've admired him...if I had emotions--which I don't.\\"  I know someone in my life who is like Dexter, somewhat schizoid.  Someone like that doesn't constantly remind himself or everyone that he doesn't have feelings.  In fact, there are some things Jeff Lindsay calls feelings and denies Dexter, which are not really feelings that Dexter would lack, such as humor, and even admiration.  The main feeling Dexter lacks is empathy and connection with other humans.      If anything, Dexter would be more often exasperated or puzzled at the behavior of others...not continually reminding us that he has no emotions, like some self-important adolescent who takes pride in his stoicism.

0307473465|4.0|The story line is as follows: A young man named Michael of 15 who lives in Germany post WWII and is sick with hepatitis and vomits outside of a 38 year old women's apartment building, Hanna. She takes pity on him and cleans him up before walking him home.<br /><br />His mother then tells him to take the women flowers to thank her. The young boy does.  He talks with her a moment before saying farewell; she asks him to wait for her and they will walk together. She goes into the bedrm and leaves the door ajar. He sees her put on stockings and she catches him peeping. He runs.<br /><br />He thinks about her for many nights before mustering the courage to return and apologies. When he arrives the women asks him to fetch her some coal from the basement, he does, and in the process gets covered in coal dust. Hanna doesn't want to send him home to his mother looking like that so she instructs him to take a bath in her apartment while she shakes his clothes out. When she returns with a towel he has an erection, instead of sending him on his way she has sex with him.<br /><br />This starts an affair where the boy is hopelessly obsessed with the older women. She has alot of control over him, and seems to be aware of it. There are times were she is abusive. During this affair the women asks him to read to her, which he does every time before they make love.<br /><br />The affair last several months until one day she just up and disappears. The young man does not take it well, but having no choice but to move on he does.<br /><br />Years later he is in college and schooling to be a lawyer. One of his classes requires him to cover the trail of some female guards from WWII who were SS at the time of the war. They were involved with a terrible fire that killed over a hundred female Jews.<br /><br />It just so happens that one of these old guards is the women from his youth, Hanna. She is now in her late forties. He of course takes great interest in the trial and never misses a day of which the two of them never speak, but only exchange a few glances.<br /><br />As the trail progresses it becomes clear that Hanna is getting pinned with a great deal of the blame.  Michael mulls over this and tries to understand why it is that she seems almost clueless to the gravity of the situation. After hearing a witness declare that Hanna had young Jewish women read to her in the camp, two and two are put together and he realizes that Hanna is illiterate.<br /><br />At the end of the trail a document is produced that is damning to Hanna and the other x-guards. The report details the day in question that the Jewish women were killed. The other x-guards testify that Hanna was in charge and wrote the report. He knows this can't be possible considering, but Hanna will not admidt to her illiteracy.<br /><br />The trial ends and the x-guars are given little punishment, but Hanna is sent away to prison for 18 years. Michael again attempts to move on, but Hanna's hold on him is too strong and the effect she had on his life is at times overwelming. He begins to read into cassette tapes that he sends to her off and on for the rest of her sentence until she is released. You can never fully understand if he does this for himself or for her, because as the years pass she does learn to read, and send small letters. He never answers them, but sends the tapes insteads. A day before she is to be let go he goes to see her. She is a old women now and resembles nothing of what he once knew. He tells her he will return the next day and help her get an apartment and a job in the outside world.<br /><br />The next day she hangs herself. She leaves a will, and tells him to take the money she made in prison and give it to one of the only survivors from her prison camp. He does, the survivor is confused as to the purpose and does not want to offer forgiveness. She ask him to do what he sees fit with the money. He donates it to a Jewish illiterate charity and takes the letter of acceptance to Hanna's grave.<br /><br />That's it in a nut shell.

B001AGXEA6|4.0|I have the DVD, and added the Blue-Ray.  A very good movie.  It is very re-watchable. It's also a good opportunity to view some famous actors in much younger days.  A much younger Alec Baldwin is hardly recognizable. Michael Keaton really isn't recognizable due to the makeup used, even though he played a great part.  Wynona Ryder plays a great part as always.  Gina Davis and Catherine O'Hara played their parts well.  Although the PQ was very good, I really didn't see any appreciable improvement in the PQ or Audio, over the earlier DVD.  I have a 5.1 system, with Polk Speakers.<br /><br />There is only one disc. There was no paper insert. The separate audio soundtrack (on the same Blue-Ray disc), failed to play on my Panasonic BD60 (with all firmware updates). Everything else played.  If you have the DVD, I don't see any benefit in getting the Blue-Ray.  I guess that's why the price dropped to close to single digits.  I'm really starting to question the benefits of Blue-Ray over DVDs.  In most Blue-Ray movies, I've watched, extras, present on earlier releases, have been removed.  I thought that was a major selling point in the Blue-Ray movement.
B00005NKK8|5.0|Great selection of tunes and brought back the movie and the times i lived through.
B00136S0NE|5.0|I have a lot of music. Probably more than I can give a proper listen to. Let's just call it a sickness I don't want to recover from. I had even given The Frames a listen back towards the beginning of their career. Nothing really prepared me for this. I saw the movie first. I never buy soundtracks and I bought this one immediately. Glen Hansard's character loses what he believes is the love of his life. He pours out his grief and and anguish in these songs. The songs he sings at night on the streets of Dublin. The days are left for songs that people recognize and have a better chance of earning some money. His music touches the heart of a Czech immigrant who's a talented musician in her own right and she helps him realize his dream of recording his music. He has his girl in London and she has a husband who didn't come to Ireland with her. Despite their commitments, there's an almost unspoken realization that true love may be standing right in front of them. Every bit of the heart, soul, warmth, humor and gentle sadness of the film is captured in the music of Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova. Hansard is a poet and the amount of emotion that he wrings out of each and every song is incredible. Irglova is a talented musician and lyricist who's voice wraps around Hansard's perfectly. I can't recommend just a few tracks, it's all good here. if you don't come away thinking that \\"Falling Slowly\\" is one of the most beautiful songs ever written, I don't know what I can do for you. Then you'll listen repeatedly to \\"When Your Mind's Made Up\\" , \\"Leave\\", \\"Trying To Pull Myself Away\\", \\"All The Way Down\\", \\"Once\\" and \\"Say It To Me Now\\". You'll find yourself seeking out The Swell Season which is Glen, Mar and members of Glen's long time and phenomenally talented band, The Frames. Then you'll turn back to The Frames themselves and memorize \\"Star, Star\\", \\"Pavement Tune\\", \\"Revelate\\", \\"What Happens When The Heart Just Stops\\", \\"Red Chord\\". 'The Stars Are Underground\\", \\"God Bless Mom\\", \\"Rent Day Blues\\" and a lot, lot more. Right here, you have a chance to watch your favorite movie, listen to the best soundtrack I've ever heard and acquire a couple of favorite bands.

B001EAWMGA|2.0|I really really wanted to like this movie after I read the back of the DVD cover.  ***SPOILER WARNINGS***<br /><br />But in the end it had way too many flaws and wasn't exciting at all.  Here is this guy with unimaginable advanced knowledge and weapondry and he uses it to shoot a tree? They kill a bear and he waits until they are back at the compound to tell them this while the creature goes on killing?  He dives back to his ship only to pick up pieces of metal instead of raiding the weapons locker?  I just think the movie would have been better by actually incorporating his technology with their cutting weapon capability.  The story did not do that, just give him a more powerful sword - woopdi do.
B000JIHP88|5.0|This product is adorable.  The lighting is perfect, not too bright. two volume settings for the music.  I personally enjoy listening to the music over the moniter.  It is very soothing.  Most favorite part, I didn't realize the leaves on the mobile moved up and down as well as around.  I had been rocking my daughter to sleep for the last four months.  Couldn't take it one more day.  She fell asleep watching it and took a 3 hour nap.
0793927501|5.0|It's a really good movie about a small outing going up to Alaska to do a Glamour Photo Shoot for a magazine.  The 3 main characters include a Billionaire(Anthony Hopkins), Model(Elle Macpherson), and Photographer(Alec Baldwin)  They're all in for more than they bargained for with life and death adventures.  Without giving it away, there is beautiful scenery, wildlife and a lot of suspense.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Love the series but did not like the narration by Sigourney Weaver for the U.S. version. Got a chance to see the BBC version and loved the narration by Sir David Attenborough. Anyone who has a Bluray player has got to get this.

B001OQCV2Y|4.0|There are elements of a Quentin Tarantino film you can always count on: upturning genre conventions, astonishing humorous violence, strong female characters, extended conversational detours, and of course, genuinely original artistic and visual intelligence. Right from its engaging, nail-biting beginning, Inglourious Basterds overflows with his now signature style.<br /><br />A group of hardened Nazi-killers stalk their prey in Nazi-occupied France as a Jewish cinema owner plots to take down top-ranking SS officers during the official premiere of a high-profile German propaganda film. As far as Lt. Aldo Raine ,aka Aldo the Apache (Brad Pitt), is concerned, his mission is to strike fear into the heart of Adolph Hitler by brutally murdering as many goose-steppers as possible, or die trying. In order to accomplish that goal, Lt. Raine recruits a ruthless team of cold-blooded killers known as \\"The Basterds\\" which includes baseball bat-wielding Bostonian Sgt. Donnie Donowitz, aka The Bear Jew (Eli Roth), and steely psychopath Sgt. Hugo Stiglitz (Til Schweiger), among others. When The Basterds' secret rendezvous with turncoat German actress Bridget von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger) goes awry, they learn that the Nazi's will be staging the French premiere of \\"The Nation's Pride,\\" a rousing propaganda film based on the exploits of German hero Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Br&uuml;hl), at a modest theater owned by Jewish cinemaphile Shoshanna Dreyfus (M&eacute;lanie Laurent), posing as French after the brutal murder of her family by the ruthless Col. Hans Landa (Christopher Waltz). As The Basterds hatch an explosive plan to take out as many Nazis as possible at the premiere, they remain completely oblivious to the fact that Shoshanna, too, longs to bring the Third Reich to its knees, and that she's willing to sacrifice her beloved theater in the process.<br /><br />Laying his story out in five chapters, Tarantino manages to keep his densely populated tale clear; we always understand the character's goals, and see where they conflict with each other. He fills each chapter with protracted verbal showdowns, and he knows well enough to punctuate all the verbal dexterity with blasts of kinetically staged violence: it's hard not to flinch when Sgt. Donnie Donowitz uses a Louisville Slugger to bash in a Nazi's head. As memorable as the movie's violence is, Tarantino ratchets up the tension with his words, and he's far more interested in the build-up than the release, something that might alienate those looking for a wall-to-wall bloodbath. Inglourious Basterds doesn't skip along swiftly, but anybody with a taste for Tarantino dialogue will savor every minute.<br /><br />Tarantino has always cast his films to perfection, and the performers here know how to get the most out of the ornate language. Brad Pitt uses a hilarious Southern drawl, and his attempts at speaking Italian are a comic highlight. As a German movie star spying for the Allies, Diane Kruger manages to be sexy, tough, smart, and flirty. But she isn't the only hard-nosed dame in the cast, thanks to M&eacute;lanie Laurent's striking performance; the French actress embodies both Shosanna's determination, as well as her fear, with equal aplomb. But as good as the entire cast is, Christoph Waltz walks away with the movie. His calmness makes the simple act of eating strudel more frightening that you could've ever thought possible. He exudes calm logic and mercilessness, and he plays Landa so matter-of-factly that even when the character does something unexpected it always seems thoroughly plausible. Even the opening scene with Colonel Hans Landa interrogating a French farmer on the whereabouts of his missing Jewish neighbors is an early highlight.  As their conversation grows increasingly intense with each line, Landa knows exactly how to slowly inflict psychological stress on his subject so that the victim will eventually break, an element of the character that Waltz underplays to arresting affect, building one genial-seeming killer, and he's all the more terrifying because of it.<br /><br />Although the actors are flawless, it is Tarantino whose name will go hand in hand with the film, as he is by the modern definition of the word an \\"auteur.\\" It's impossible to miss the distinctive  mark he puts on all his films, but as an artist he doesn't repeat himself. Because Tarantino keeps evolving, Inglourious Basterds might not be the movie you'd expect, you may even find that the movie was 50 minutes longer than it should be, but never, ever, expect nothing less than a refreshing experience in cinema that will take your faith in innovation to new highlights. A new War Classic is born, simple as that.er, and he's all the more terrifying because of it.

0805028846|5.0|First, I was born without a genetic predeliction for anything that involved cutting paper; following written instructions for folding things; coloring maps,paperdolls etc., pasting; or, heaven forbid, having a clean looking product when I did finish.  After 70 years of being mesmerized by pop-up books, I decided that if I started with children's books, I might just get something to work for me.  It took time, lots of time, but I finally graduated from three tiered cakes amd simple 'v' cuts, to a grown up book.  Other reviews convinced me that this author had a successful teaching method and after five prior books, I decided I was ready to test myself against Mr. Jackson's claim.  After many, many, many, hours of working with his book, I finally mastered the free standing dove on the front of the book.  I cried.

0385504225|2.0|Brown's language is cliche and overwrought, and there's a disappointing pay-off at the end.  The attempted reconciliation of science and religion is tiresome -- it's been done and overdone.  As ever, it's only interesting for as long as the science remains mysterious.
B0029O08WA|1.0|Come on folks, you shouldn't fork out hard earned money so that you GROW TO LOVE A CD.  I love music, all kinds of music.  I have played the Twilight CD over and over and over again, but this CD sucks.  I listened to it on Itunes and here on Amazon.  As a whole it sucks.  I only like two songs on this CD.  I liked Friends and the one by Muse. Muse is just too awesome.  AND WHY didn't she use \\"Time Is Running Out\\" by Muse on the soundtrack.  It would have been perfect for the drive in the Porshe.  Clearly, Meyer doesn't have control over what is put on the soundtrack.  Anyway, if you want to GROW TO LOVE this CD go ahead, but I'm going to by the new CD by Daughtry.
B0029O08WA|2.0|I absolutely love the Twilight soundtrack and listen to it daily.  I am extremely disappointed with the New Moon soundtrack.  The songs tend to blurr together with similarities.  The soundtrack could have been as awesome as Twilight if different artists\titles had been selected.  Stephanie Meyer's playlist she selected when writing New Moon would have worked a lot better for the soundtrack.  These are the worst songs I have ever listened to.  I hope that the Eclipse soundtrack is as exciting as the Twilight soundtrack and not a dud like New Moon.

B001GCUO1Q|4.0|First off, I'm not what you'd call a fanboy. If you think that invalidates my opinion of this film and that's going to put you off reading this review, then so long and happy trails, pilgrim.    That said, I know of \\"The X Men\\" - read some of the comics as a kid, can identify the characters and had soaked up some vague knowledge of \\"Wolverine's\\" origins from somewhere. I saw the first \\"X Men\\" film at the cinema (yawned and winced my way through it), saw the second one on DVD (yawned and winced my way through that as well) and unintentionally saw the third one on TV over the weekend (and actually quite enjoyed it, the change of director, the increasing moral ambiguity and the increased level of peril to the muties made for a much more enjoyable experience).    I initially had no desire to see \\"Wolverine\\", but the change in tone of the third film made me think that there might be something in it. So I rented it.     My Two Cents?    Its good stuff. Let me qualify that. Its good stuff if you're in the mood for a big, dumb, CGI filled Hollywood blockbuster (which was actually filmed in NSW - go skips!) in which lots of things blow up. The fact that it's an origin tale also helped as I'm a sucker for a good origin story.    Hugh Jackman, by his own admission, wanted to take this one to darker places and he does so with aplomb. He also has the perfect foil in Liev Schrieber's \\"Sabretooth\\", who turns out to be the catalyst that ultimately sends him down the road to becoming the man with the cuisinart claws. It has some nice twists in it and some great cameos by other mutants that I vaguely remembered from sunny afternoons spent reading Marvel comics in the back-garden as a child. There's also a deeply amusing riff on the nature of what really happened at \\"Three Mile Island\\".    That said, I did wince twice (did we really need the glib shot of Wolfboy walking away stone-faced from an exploding helicopter or the obligatory crane shot of him looking up to the sky and yelling\\"NOOOOOOOOOO!!!\\" at the heavens? I mean, come on - those were already bad cliches when both the universe AND Dick Clark were young)    Will you enjoy it?     Well, take the following as a litmus test.    I've hated all three of the \\"Spiderman\\" films, the first two \\"X-Men\\" films and the first \\"Hulk\\" movie.    However, I really, really enjoyed [[ASIN:B00005JPS8 Iron Man (Two-Disc Special Collectors' Edition)]] and really enjoyed [[ASIN:B001DHXT2A The Incredible Hulk (Three-Disc Special Edition)]] (the one with Ed Norton where, you know, you actually got to see the Hulk smash some stuff up?) and quite enjoyed this film.    So my cards are on the table and from them you can make your own call, hombre.
0385504225|2.0|I had quite a big expectations after reading Da Vinchi Code and Angels and Demons, but this books is not at all up to the mark. The essence of the book was good but I felt the writing was weak and the end was bad. The villain character, I felt was totally stupid, I mean how can he hide his full tattooed body with the make up? Robert drowned but yet he's still alive that was a biggest put off and some more things like that.    I don't think that its worth spending money and time.
B000HCO83Q|3.0|Although, lets be honest, it couldn't have been any worse now, could it?    But let's not focus on the negative.    Here's why it's a better film:     - It has a better plot    - It actually puts the mutants through some pain for a change (after two films of seeing them dance rings around humanity, they, like the characters from the truly awful [[ASIN:B000E1MTZE The Complete Matrix Trilogy (The Matrix/ The Matrix Reloaded/ The Matrix Revolutions) [HD DVD]]], never really seemed to be in any great peril. Not so with this film. A weapon that can definitively rob them of their mutant natures levels the playing field).    - It injects some moral ambiguity into the plot; you can tell that Ian McKellen (himself a legendary gay activist in the UK) relishes the chance to explore the concept of a cure for a condition (read 'orientation') that can mold one's identity whilst simultaneously making them a societal outcast in some quarters. Kudos to McKellen's performance - I actually found myself rooting for Magneto's brotherwood to prevail.          Brett Ratner clearly feels less affection for the characters than Bryan Singer and in this case, that's no bad thing. I don't mind a director loving his characters as long he's not prepared to let that get in the way of the plot - something that Singer always did. I'll be honest, I wrote off the X-Men films after seeing the first two, but this one actually caused me to go out and hire [[ASIN:B001GCUO1Q X-Men Origins: Wolverine]] the night after I saw this on television.     Also major props to Ellen Page. She really is a talented young thing.     Its not the greatest film ever made, but it is a road-sign to better things.    Now can we have some proper \\"Sentinels\\" in number four, please?
6305907145|3.0|This is another movie with a Jane Austen touch.  The story is based on Jane Austen's notes from her journal and diaries.<br /><br />Set in England in the early 1800's this is a story about a poor, but smart, young girl develops into a strong-willed woman who makes her own destiny.  She does not let others do it for her.<br /><br />The opening scene shows a nine year old Fanny leaving Portsmith by stagecoach.  Her mother is sending Fanny to her wealthy sisters' home, Mansfield Park, to be given an education and raised in comfort.  We see her mother living in poverty with many children about two years apart.  Fannie is raised with her cousins, but not accepted as having the high status of the Mansfield Park family (The Bertrams).  She falls in love with her cousin, Edmond, however, he is conflicted during most of the movie and it is not clear he loves her.<br /><br />Fanny keeps in touch with her family through letters to her sister.  She loves to read and write and her intelligence and wit shine through.<br /><br />There is also soapbox drama when con-artists arrive to the estate.  Mary and Henry Crawford want to establish ties with the the Bertram's through marriages so they can inherit some of the fortune and estate.  Henry proposed to Fanny, she would not take up his offer.  Her Uncle is astonished and sends her home to the slum-living of her family in Portsmith to make her obey.<br /><br />There are many twists and turns, but the ending is happy.
B002HHPVHQ|1.0|Not very well written and not very well told. The author is, however, taken by the idea he has something new to say. He is mistaken. He thinks that the financial products that caused the collapse were new only because he never heard of them before.   I have read half a dozen books on the 2008 market and they were all better than this vanity exercise. better to read Gillian Tett or Wm. Cohan than this effort. As bad as it is,Judge Posner's book is better than this.
B002SE55WE|4.0|The new SGU series is off to a good start with a solid 3-part opening episode. However, part #3 felt a little stretched out and quite predictable, especially the never-ending dessert plot-line. Not to mention that the timeline of the events was rather unrealistic, even given \\"plot license\\" (don't want to go into details for spoiler-free purposes).     After three episodes, SGU looks quite promising. This is a more BSG-influenced version of Stargate, starting with a similar premise (destruction of base) and emergency run to safety away from home and the familiar. They even use some of the handheld camera tricks.     This edition of Stargate (so far) promises to be a bit darker and more drama-character-centric. There is definitely a lot of potential for this series, but then again, Atlantis had a lot of potential when it started, but it sort of under-achieved considering the magic and wonders of the ancient city of Atlantis that could have been explored in more detail, instead of resorting to more predictable plotlines. Not that Atlantis was not a very good scifi show, it's just that it could have been a whole lot better.
0439023491|5.0|Great book, goes along with the first one, Hunger Games.  Can't wait to get the next one!
0679736646|5.0|You probably already know the basic plot, so I won't bore you with that.    The plot is very convoluted and explores the nature of reality and consciousness and what we can know is real.      The story itself starts slow and gains steam in the 2nd half of the book, which by the way at only 200 pages is just right.    My only gripe is that the writing style is quite dated and - I don't know if he tried, but for a sci-fi writer, Dick sure didn't predict 1992 very well.  Some of his ideas seem cliched by today's standards and others missed the mark.    Overall, a quick, thought-provoking read.    RECOMMENDATION: If you like these sorts of twisted stories, read Bad Monkeys by Matt Ruff - I liked it a lot more than this - although I know that is blasphemy to sci-fi zealots.  Oh well.
045122499X|3.0|I was a bit disappointed with this book.  I loved reading Pillars of the Earth, probably read it 3 times now.  But World Without End seemed like it was rushed.  The theme of the story was good and there was the typical Ken Follett twists, turns, drama, sex, action, and suspense.  And of course, the justice and vindication for the heroes in the book.  I liked how he tied many of the characters, events, and setting to the previous book; I don't think it was overdone.  Also liked how he tied in some historical events into this story (as he does with many other books).  But this book seemed like it was written with a deadline.  I missed some of the style he used in Pillars where he described emotions and situations in a more creative, captivating way.  Good story, but the writing could have been better.

0131177052|5.0|This was one of those famous, timeless books (like Code Complete) that I had heard many people talk about, and I finally read it. To be honest it was in my Amazon \\"Wish List\\" for several months before I ordered it, but it lived up to the hype.     Remember when you first started writing software? Like most people, for me it was a very exciting time and I truly enjoyed learning and trying to push the boundaries of programming. It is a very primal passion that engulfed me, and it is the reason many of us got into this industry. Where did that go? Do you still feel that today? If so, you are one of the lucky ones. In this book, Michael explains how large code bases (that don't have tests around them) can sometimes suck that enjoyment out of our day-to-day tasks, because we slowly develop a fear making changes to this monolithic application because we are worried about what we might break or what expected side-effects fixing a bug or adding a new feature might have. Although we might not typically acknowledge this fear, it is present whether we admit it or not.     Sometimes we romanticize the idea of working on \\"Greenfield\\" projects, because if we were just able to start from scratch ... this would be much easier and a lot more fun. I have slowly become convinced that isn't the case. There is tedious and unexpected ripples in new projects just like existing projects. This book is dedicated to given practical techniques to remove that fear, and get to a place where you can actually enjoy working in your code base. It is possible, and Michael has the experience and expertise to help you bring your legacy systems under control.     I often am weary that books like this that are on \\"hot\\" topics like test-driven-development are fluff, and aren't very relevant to my day-to-day real-world code. Not true ... at least not on this book. I would highly recommend this to book to anyone. It is worth the money, time, and effort to read it cover-to-cover. This is probably in my top 5for technology books in terms of real-world value they provide.     To read the full review or find more reviews for technical books, visit [...]

CHARLIE HUNNAM WHO PLAYS JAX IS COMPLEX AS HE IS DEDICATED TO THE CLUB, HOWEVER HAS TURMOIL AS HE HAS A HUMANITY SIDE HE CANNOT IGNORE ESPECIALLY WHEN HIS OLD LOVE INTEREST (NOW A DOCTOR) IS BACK IN TOWN. VERY SEXY AND DRAMATIC SERIES THAT HAS U WANTING MORE AND MORE.
0385504225|3.0|I found this book to be quite entertaining.  Brown developed a nice range of characters to express an \\"enlightened\\" response in contrast to a character that represents a powerful challenge to such views.  It was certainly enough to supply me with an adequately engaging reading experience, and the presentation is sufficiently careful with respect to \\"facts\\" that it weaves a fairly coherent adventure.<br />I like the way that he is able to take the protagonist, the professor Langdon, through a kind of metaphorical journey, and is even able to kill him and resurrect him in a way that is plausible.  In fact, it is enjoyable to see how the author can pose problems for his unfolding tale that one thinks would superficially involve magic or the supernatural, and instead invoke science or historical knowledge as plausible explanations without stretching one's imagination into the obvious directions of the supernatural or magic.<br />To my mind, he is able to show how closely science represents the modern replacement for religion and magic for the \\"enlightened\\" mind.  (Even to the extent of attempting to delineate a kind of \\"good\\" vs \\"evil\\" within this context of modernity.)<br />Of course, posing riddles and solving them in this way, and weaving symbolism into modern science, as he does, has its cost in terms of a certain overall unconvincingness and superficiality.  But I consider it a good enough book to be worth the effort to read.
B0001Z2RUK|5.0|LOVE THIS ARTIST'S VOICE, MYSTICAL AND MAGICAL. PEOPLE ARE ATTUNED TO HIS VOICE. GREAT CD, GLAD IT'S MINE
0380977788|3.0|There are authors that I love for their use of language -- a gifted wordsmith doesn't always have to have a great story to keep my attention. And then there are writers that are actually storytellers. Neil Gaiman falls into the latter category. In his telling of \\"Coraline\\", he uses a clipped, choppy style that absolutely drove me crazy... until I got sucked into the imaginative and undeniably scary story.<br /><br />This is the stuff of nightmares: Coraline is a young girl with less-than-attentive working parents. Like any spunky heroine, Coraline goes on adventures that quickly get her into trouble. The story begins when Coraline and her family move into a new home, an old rambling estate broken into three flats. Of the 14 doors in the house, only 13 go anywhere... or so it seems.<br /><br />There are lots of things that go bump in the night in this book, but Gaiman really goes outside of the box with his scares. If Stephen King took a stab at retelling \\"Alice in Wonderland,\\" it might read something like \\"Coraline.\\" Even as a \\"grown-up,\\" it touched on a level of buried-deep fear and revulsion that will stick in my memory banks for awhile. (insert shiver here)<br /><br />The book jacket touted \\"Coraline\\" as a book for all ages. While I agree that any adult reader will be reeled in by the dark and imaginative fairy tale and that even young readers could probably handle the vocabulary and length of the novel... I'd strongly disagree with the editors' recommendation for readers as young as age 8. As a kid with a wild imagination, this would have kept me up nights. Lots of them. As an adult with an imagination that has only slightly tamed over the years... it still might keep me up tonight.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|What more to say.  This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.  You have to be into British humor, but if you are, this movie is absolutely hysterical.
0060765380|5.0|I was at Wal-Mart one day and came across The Judas Strain. I didn't know if I would like it b/c it has history in it and I'm not much of a history fan. I was totally wrong. James Rollins mixes history, medical drama and action altogether that kept me reading well into the night. This book is kind of like the OutBreak movie with a killer virus dating back to the time of Marco Polo. It has history but it will not bore you one bit! Its about terrorists that hijack a ship to find a cure for the Judas Virus that came about in the time of Marco Polo. A doctor is forced to help the hijackers find a cure and also make the virus so it can be released into the whole world like a plague. It has action, adventure and lots of memorable characters. I have read all of James Rollins books and he puts history into his book so that even the person that hates history with a passion will love his books. Read his books. You won't be sorry.
0375842209|5.0|One of the best serious books I have read in the last 15 years since I read Theodore Dreiser, Jack London and Victor Hugo.  The absurdity of a war, brainwashing German civilians faced in Nazi Germany, human cruelty or the lack thereof filled in with fathomless kindness.   The story to be told by Death is a brilliant idea. I have never read anything like that. The storyteller is supposedly absolutely neutral and has no feelings, thus its observations of us, humans, is stuff to think about. Although, the story is grim and serious, narration by Death made reading the book a lot easier than if it were told by a mortal. Quite a few times I felt sorry for the mighty servant who, albeit being Death himself, could not comprehend why humans seek so fervently to hurt each other. I don't know how Markus Zusak managed it but he succeeded in portraying Death to be more humane (kind?) than some of the fellow two legged creatures.  It is a very moving book. Well written. It captivates your attention from the first page and lingers with you long after you have finished the book.
0060557818|5.0|I had read Stardust when I was very young and, although it was really good, did not really like it.  Needless to say, I was a bit hesitant when I saw Neverwhere.  I took a chance with it, and it has become my favorite Neil Gaiman book.  I recommended it to my brother and my sister, and they loved it.  I recommended it to my boyfriend, who after reading it, became an even bigger Neil Gaiman fan than I was.  Gaiman is superb when it comes to creating characters.  His characters in this book really did it for me.  I couldn't put it down.  And then there was London Below--a genius creation.  Gaiman is a master at his craft.  I recommend this to anyone who is bored, wants to escape, or just loves an adventure.
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|More excellent then I remember. You can hear so much more detail then before, almost like hearing it for the first time. Ringo really was a great drummer! (That WAS him, wasn't it?) There is definetely a difference with this remastered edition.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|What a great deal. This is one of a few albums I can honestly say that I love every song! I was in the 3rd grade when these guys hit our shores with these songs, but good music stands the test of time. I don't have audiophile tastes or the keen sense of hearing to compare the original to the remastered, but I know what I like, and this music is still great fun to listen to after all these years.
0061544493|4.0|Received this for Christmas last year and I really do love this book.  Posh is clearly herself and writing from her perspective on everything.

A great piece to have if you are a fashion book collector or just a fashionista like me!
1416585710|1.0|Well, it's been a long time coming, but with Lisey's Story, Stephen King has finally hit peak pretension.    Lisey's Story is the tale of a widow who was married to a super brilliant, funny, spectacular writer husband, who everyone loved because how could you not love someone who is perfect and clearly not a Mary Sue?  The book makes sure to tell us frequently that the wife is somewhat stupid, and plain and didn't deserve him at all, but she was lucky to have known him, etc.    Worst of all, nearly every other word is some invented cutsey phrase (the kind King likes in all of his books, but at least used sparingly before this).  He tries to justify it by saying that it's the secret language of their marriage and you just wouldn't understand, but it makes husband and wife seem like full blown retards.  They use words like \\"smuck\\" in place of the curse word with which it rhymes, refer to insanity as \\"the bad gunky,\\" go to an alternate dimension they call, for no reason, Boo'ya Moon, their catch phrase is \\"Strap it on whenever it seems appropriate,\\" and they are both just delightful and clever and lovable.  All of these phrases, of course, are invented by the brilliant husband, which is why you find them so charming.    The husband, endearing and adorable, says that he caught these brilliant phrases from the magical sea of words!  and each time you mention the sea of words, you must add \\"Where we all go down to drink and fish.\\"  No, seriously, you MUST add that last part each time you mention the language lake (which happens about four times each chapter and never without the \\"Where we all go down to drink and fish\\" bit, because it's too brilliant to be used only once).  I recently checked out the audio cassette from the library, and it's truly embarrassing to hear a woman (Mare Winningham, if you're curious) attempt to say all this trite juvenelia as though it's NOT idiotic.  But, hey, you do what you have to do to make money, right?  And at this point, Stephen King could defecate on his agent's desk and they'd try to find a way to publish it, and by God, it would sell.    Basically, Stephen King's writing career has been a long and introspective journey, in the sense that it's been a journey so deep up into his own bowels that he probably couldn't find his way out now even if he had a detailed map.

0385504225|5.0|Back in 1980 Lester Hayes, Fred Biletnikoff, and other NFL players used a product called \\"Stickum\\" to keep from dropping the football. Somehow Dan Brown has come up with the literary equivalent of that substance. Once this book is in the reader's hands it is very hard to drop. Mr. Brown has given protagonist Robert Landon another challenge . . . and lives are at stake! The inability to determine friend and foe makes this dash through Washington, DC, and the deciphering of the coded Masonic-related symbols within the city, a \\"breath-holder\\" from the prologue to the story's explosive climax.     Mr. Brown's ability to eloquently and delicately blur the lines between fact and fiction made this writer travel to the nation's capital to see what was real and what was not and to, at least to some degree, experience the thrill of the chase.
0307346617|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was thought provoking and insightful into human nature and our societies,with the back drop of the \\"G\\" infestation. I would recommend to anyone who has the slightest interest in pandemics, zombies, or societal downfall.
0061914177|5.0|It's a quick read, but also a mantra for future reference and inspiration. I read 1/2 the book just last night and it's REALLY good. If you've never heard Gary speak in person or sat through any of his talks on YouTube - then this is a good gathering of all his great points and philosophies - plus some pretty cool stories about his background and childhood. Above all, it's geniune and honest - which is what the whole point of the book is really.
0061730327|5.0|As someone interested in African history, culture, and politics I could not help but enthusiastically delve into William Kamkwamba's \\"The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind.\\" After reading it I feel as if it is very emblematic of Sub-Saharan Africa. There is so much poverty, corruption, lack of opportunity, etc. but there is also an incredible untapped potential in this area of the world. Kamkwamba's story is about as compelling as they come, and demonstrates how crucial it is that we as a species learn to better encourage the inventiveness of people, no matter how young or old.    The part of the book about building the windmill was engrossing enough, but the first half of the book delivers a vivid portrait of life in Malawi that sets the stage for the remarkable second half of the book. This book, despite being over 300 pages long, is a fast read due to the heavy amount of dialogue and the skill of the writer. It is definitely a real page turner. The cool thing is that when you read \\"The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind,\\" you not only get an incredibly inspiring story, but you also get a meaningful look into the culture of Malawi. It is impressive how well this book not only entertains at a high level, but also educates the reader at a high level.    \\"The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind\\" is a great tale of ingenuity and hope. It is a true testament to the human spirit that resides in everyone on the planet. It is a well-written book that can be enjoyed by both teenagers and adults.
B00000G3AZ|5.0|I loved this movie  It is beautifully filmed, the costumes and scenery are lovely to look at and make it believable coming from it's time period.  I am a huge Jane Austen fan and am trying to watch every version of all of her books.  This is the only version of Emma that I've seen so far. The movie is very funny and generally quite light as opposed to Sense and Sensibility or Mansfield Park - however that doesn't take away from the character development or the teaching of good morals and the satisfaction of a beautiful ending to the story which only occurs after Emma has learned the lessons she desperately needs to learn.  I loved the humor - it is a wonderful \\"girl\\" movie with laughs and tears and of course beautiful language with nothing objectionable...It is the kind of movie that gives you the escape that you need into a world that is believable on some level but not real enough to be depressing.  My only objection is that the DVD has no bonus materials - I would've loved to hear director and actor comments during the film as is often done and or a section on how the movie was made.  After seeing several of these in other movies - it brings the movie alive in another way.  Well worth watching.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I was not dissapointed in this DVD. It added more to an already great movie. Give it a try!

B002NXQ0X8|5.0|Ok, admittedly this music is very mellow and is stuff you might put on a playlist with a name like \\"Alone in the Dark,\\" \\"Struck Out at the Bar Last Night\\" or \\"Just Got Dumped.\\" For the kind of music it is I think this CD (or whatever you call a group of songs these days) is great. The only songs I don't really like too much are the \\"Blackie's Dead\\" songs since they don't quite seem to fit with the rest of the music  for some reason. Song like \\"I am the Cosmos\\" are awesome though.<br /><br />When I originally bought this I had some trepidation about Scarlett Johansen and her vocals on these tracks but they blend very well with the type of music it is. Her voice is much better than I expected but she still doesn't show that she has a very powerful voice like a Broadway singer or anything but, the cool thing, is that she didn't need to on any of these songs and for what she needed to do her voice worked very well.<br /><br />Check out the songs and grab it you feel like you need some new kind of mellow music and don't be afraid of an actress trying to sing in this case.
B002L6NYBS|5.0|For those who haven't enjoyed the Searle cartoons of the early 1950s film with Alastrair Sim, this movie is a delight. In this day of Will Farrell stupidity and dumbing down, it's a treat to watch something whose humour may be unsubtle but is fun. Rupert Everette steals the show in his 2 roles. I never thought anyone after Sim could do this but he does with style. I'm not going to spoil the surprises thriugh the film. I watched it on Virgin coming back from one of my London trip and am sure I annoyed other passenegers with my laughing. Who cares! Get the DVD because a sequel is about to be released and maybe this time whatever idiot is in charge of international distribution will make sure it gets a wide US release. Movies like this make it worth looking into a region-free DVD player!

The lemon poppy seed teacake was almost completely raw in the middle despite the gorgeous outside appearance.  It was also heavy and oily.  I figured my oven must be the problem because I followed the recipe exactly.  Bought an oven thermometer and realized it runs about 20 degrees too high.  Decided to then try the apple muffins and adjusted the temperature accordingly.  The muffins didn't rise much and were so dry.  Too expensive dishes in the trash.  I'm about to give up!

1594488916|4.0|This true story is a great read for anyone who loves books. This story follows our author through her introduction to the book collecting world and one of the world's largest bad guys-John Gilkey. The story follows Bartlett as she learns the ropes of the collecting world and her interactions with a very active book thief Gilkey. There is a great parallel between Bartlett's connection to some of the greatest collectors and sellers of fine books and to an amazing book thief.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book because of the look it gave me into the world of book collecting. I never knew that book collecting was such serious business and that thieves like Gilkey were a part of this world. I also loved how Bartlett gave us an in depth look into the mind of this thief. This look allowed us to see what people think about when they are obsessed about something, book collecting in Gilkey's case.<br /><br />Although I really did enjoy this book it might not be for everything. I think someone who does not love books as much as I do might not enjoy the detailed looks into the collecting world that Bartlett gives. An \\"outsider\\" if you will, might find the book collecting details unnecessary or overdone. Again, personally I enjoyed this part of the book, but not everyone might. Overall I would suggest this book to my many book loving friends.

B000F4LPJ6|5.0|Battle Royale: 10/10: Another classic is born. A fantastic combination of classical music and ultra-violence like a Japanese Clockwork Orange. Here is one Japanese film the major studios will not be remaking anytime soon.    The plot consists of a junior high school class sent to a deserted island, given weapons that vary in usefulness, and are ordered to kill each other. Oh and they have those exploding collars that are ubiquitous in sci-fi films today so if they don't kill all their classmates everyone dies.    The actors are actual kids and the film turns the bloody up to eleven. Add in child suicide, child prostitution, patricide, and worst of all basketball and you have yourself a winner.    Battle Royale falls solidly in the category of Dawn of the Dead or Kill Bill where it transcends its obvious pulp and horror appeal and says larger things about life as a whole.    But who am I kidding non-stop action, hot chicks in schoolgirl outfits, very dark humor and a great classical music score. Kind of like She's All That if Freddy Prinze Jr. killed a classmate every two minutes then had his head blown off by remote control. Throw in Anna Paquin dismembering Rachael Leigh Cooke with a fondue fork and that should give you the picture.    Man that movie would rule Sorry went all fan boy there for a minute. Battle Royale has deep things to say about society and is an important landmark film. [...].
0385504225|4.0|The DaVinci Code and Angels and Demons are Dan's best.  This book, while good, requires much foreknowledge of Free Masons and symbols etc.  I have read extensively on these subjects so was able to follow the written word.  However, I do feel that the conclusion \\"came out of left field\\".  I still would recommend it as a good read.

B0029O08WA|3.0|So. I happen to have a very eclectic taste in music and indie is something i do like.  But dude. I also like variety. Though it took me a while to warm up to it, I absolutely loved the Twilight album and still listen to it today. I knew New Moon would be different and i expected that...but in retrospect, most of the songs really run together for me.  Few stand out and i find myself pushing the \\"next\\" button on my ipod just so i can finally get to the last song...which is by the way amazing and i can't wait to buy the score of the film.  I'll also say this...just like the first album, i am liking this one more and more the longer i listen to it.  \\"White Demon Love Song\\" has made quite an impression on me as well as \\"Satellite Heart\\". I can picture so many of these songs being played throughout the book, but i do feel as though it were incomplete. Maybe hearing the songs coupled with the film will help me re-rate this album with another star or two.
B000006MV8|5.0|I'm a long-time Beatles and Badfinger fan, and I've heard all their albums many many dozens of times, so it's pretty hard at this late date to be surprised by relistening to any one of their records.<br /><br />That changed the other day when I put the remastered Straight Up in my car cd player.<br /><br />From start to finish, this record is pure pop perfection, as good an album as any latter-day Beatles or Macca record, and perhaps better in some instances.<br /><br />Among the many highlights -- the opening track, \\"Take It All,\\" is timeless, with brilliant three-part harmonies and shined to a production tee by the great Todd Rundgren.<br /><br />In fact, you can appreciate Todd's craft simply by listening to the original production tracks that are added on to the re-release.  Although the first versions of \\"Flying\\" or \\"Money\\" still sound great, they are a different animal under Todd's crisp, deep, resonant production.<br /><br />Putting aside the massive pop construction of songs like \\"Baby Blue\\" or \\"Day After Day\\" this record flies like Lady Madonna, Let It Be, or Macca' Ram with gems like \\"Perfection\\" and the tremendous closer \\"It's Over.\\"<br /><br />This is a remarkable achievement and easily one of the most underrated records from what I consider to be the finest period in rock music.
0394826817|3.0|Pretty Cute book, not really what I was thinking it was going to be, but the kids like it and it does help to illustrate proper manners
0385504225|5.0|Although quite similar in writing stye/theme to the Da Vinci Code this book is excellent.  The factual elements that are intermixed with mystery elements of the story are very interesting.  So interesting that I found myself \\"google-ing\\" them at different points in the story just to prove to myself that they were real.  They were!  This is a \\"page turner\\" that keeps you glued to the book, always anxious to see where all the \\"twists and turns\\" are going to lead you!  An excellent book through out, and very enjoyable reading!
0394873742|5.0|This book is awesome, there is so much to look at and do, the kids love to lay on the floor and find new things everytime they read it.  I didn't pay attention to the size when I ordered, but am glad I got it.  The kids think it is really neat that the book is as tall as they are!!

This is what Katniss Everdeen experienced in The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins.  This book is an extraordinary read; a must read for anyone. Katniss struggles with survival, sanity, and love when she is sent on this perilous journey.  The boy who saved her life is being sent with her and she will be forced to kill him or hope someone else does so she doesn't have to herself. She is forced to be someone she isn't and must face many challenges and decisions.   The first time I heard about this book, I thought it would be an okay read.  When I decided to read it I assumed it would be one of the better books I had read. It wasn't. It is the best book I have ever read. This is the type of book that keeps your interest throughout the entire story and is impossible to put down.  I ask you this: Are you willing to stay up late to read?  Then this is the book for you.  Rom AL-T 7/8
B0018CWESK|5.0|This movie had everything it held your attention from start to finish, the great thing about it was, every monster I had ever seen as a child was in this movie.No other movie has ever given us Dracula,Frankenstein,wolf Man and Mr. Hyde. It started old World and finished modern. I loved the take on James Bond gaget inventor who was not yet quite a priest and Van Helsing's guide. Your heart just went out to the Frankenstein monster. The story line was fantastic you understood what was going on the entire time . The visual effects was exciting, but i wanted Anna valeris brother who looked a lot like Errol Flynn ,to stay alive a little longer,and it would have been great if you could have seen them clearer in the clouds at the end . But as a whole this movie was spectacular.
B0029O08WA|4.0|I bought this album not as a Twilight fan, but as a Death Cab/Killers/Ok Go/etc. fan. Tweenie-boppers who are obsessed with this franchise and think Paramore is super-cool-hard-core-punk (I just threw up a little bit) will most likely hate this, saying something along the lines of \\"OMG! This sounds like some old crap my parents would listen to! I hate this! I'm going to go cut myself now!!! Team Edward!!!!!\\" It is so so so so so much better than the lightweight Twilight soundtrack. Bon Iver is impeccable, as always, Thom Yorke is solid, and Friends by Band of Skulls is just really really FUN. Hopefully all of the teens will listen to this more even though they're disappointed and grow to appreciate it. Seriously, (not trying to sound like an a-hole) but this is good music. Have fun imagining what will be going on in the movie based on the lyrics of each song. It's totally fun.
B0029O08WA|1.0|I did not like this soundtrack at all.  I really liked the Twilight soundtrack although I thought the movie was just okay.  I hope that this soundtrack does not have any indication on how New Moon the movie will be because if so I'm going to be doubly disappointed.  While I love almost everything Twilight related - I did not love this and would NOT recommend buying it.
B001XRLWPQ|4.0|One of the better new series to air this year. It is much in line with the \\"Murder, She Wrote\\" in reverse; a younger writer, male, a younger detective, female, and set in NYC instead of Cabot Cove, Maine. They display the same type of humor as MSW, and the same, \\"AH HA!\\" finish. I wish them as long a run as MSW had.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|Fantastic!!! Love the packaging, love the sound.  I never had a Beatles collection so this was perfect for me.  On a selfish side...i wish i was among the only few thousands who got in early on the Mono Set with a second pressing not done. But love and peace to all that are getting the Mono set - first, second, or third pressing.    One thing i was surprised at was how great \\"Beatles For Sale\\" is.  And yes, Sgt. Pepper is a revelation in Mono.  So what if it is expensive and doesn't contain all the albums...i have enjoyed every second of it and will continue until the end.    If you don't have a Beatles collection - get this set.  If you have the '87 albums - get this set.  If you..... you get my drift. If you get it you will love it.    There is only one small issue.  The Mono set has replica min lps as they were released in the UK, and they look and feel wonderful.  I don't know how many of you know or remember that the first release of \\"Let It Be\\" (yes i know it wasn't done in mono.....) in the Uk came out in a special set with a lot of goodies.  I wish that the LIB album in replica min lps would also be available with those posters, photos and so on.  We can hope.    So if you have the funds then get this Mono set.  YOU WILL LOVE IT!
0060254920|5.0|I consider Maurice Sendak to be one of the finest authors of children's literature of all time. I was a daycare provider for over 20 years and raised 4 girls of my own, and this was always a favorite for all of us.
B001974DG0|5.0|I loved this book. One of the few I went back to re-read after about 15 years. If you have ever loved a dog, you can\\"t help but wish he could communicate the way this brilliant golden retriever can who is smarter than the people in the book. In addition, the scary parts of the story keep you in suspense beginning to end. Along with many readers (according to Koontz) I have wished for a sequal to this story. Read and enjoy.
B000002TRM|2.0|...the live tunes are pretty good.  Even though I am a huge fan of RHCP, save your money because $19.99 + tax ans shipping just isn't worth it for a couple of songs.  My suggestion, buy the three or four MP3s that are worth your time.
1932907009|5.0|Save the Cat just might very well save your scripts from being round-filed before they read page 10. I heard about the late Blake Snyder at the Willamette Writers Conference from a professional script reader. I bought this book and his sequel called, Save the Cat goes to the Movies. This book really gives you the a-ha moment when you read how to build your screenplay from the ground up. It's like building a model. You need to get all of the pieces together and fitted before you put it together. For a book with only 195 ages, it carries a lot of easy to read and powerful information. I know there are a lot of how-to books on screenwriting out there, but you really need to have this in your library.<br />The company that I ordered both books from delivered it fast and I would use them again.
B000002H97|5.0|I actually just bought this a few days ago, deciding to give it another chance.  I have been on a metallica kick recently.  I saw them on this album tour 18 yrs ago and have been a fan since the very early days.  I still have the no life to leather demo, so I go back a long time.  Maybe age has softened me.  When this came out in '91 I hated it with a passion. I was so entrenched in death metal (still am) and thrash that this release felt like a betrayal for being such a loyal fan, The band gave up their thrash roots and were influenced by Bob Rock way too much.  Well if the band wanted to still put out a thrash album they could have at that point.  It was not like Bob Rock was pointing a gun to the members heads, the band was just way too easily influenced with him at the helm.  It's a shame.  A bunch of these songs I still feel would have been better if they were thrashed and speeded up.  Anyway, enter a more mellow band.  The band experimented with simpler song structures with a pretty massive production.  I do like the production on this and the guitar sound is amazing.  Songs are super catchy, enter sandman, the amazing sad but true-killer riff, the unforgiven, struggle within, nothing else matters, all catchy numbers.  The band quickly made millions of new fans with this release and enter sandman started to get played at baseball and football games across the world.  I have opened up over the years more, and feel this is a great record.  I don't think it holds a candle to their first 4 releases or death magnetic, but I do feel that it's a great heavy record in it's own right.
B002KLAL4W|3.0|I think this album will take a bit of \\"work\\" to like, which has been the case with most of their albums (for me anyway).  The songs that immediately grabbed me are:  the fixer, just breath, amongst the waves, and force of nature.  So these four warrant my satisfaction, in a immediate sense anyway.  These songs all have nice elements and seem not to be overdone.  The guitar solo on amongst the waves is edgy and showcases mcready's maturity.  But I would like to hear more from mcready on this album.  There are nice textures in \\"force of nature\\" that sound a bit like the edge from U2...not a bad reference.  I think Gossard is weak on this album, as he's usually pitching in with some solid chord progressions but he seems to be playing in the background.    I can't say much about the lyrics yet as i'm still trying to understand what eddie wants to say.  It hasn't been so hard in the past to understand eddie and perhaps he was more of a poet in previous albums.  His words on this album seem a bit simplistic, maybe reflecting the simpler musical layout.    At the end of the day, this album will be spun a lot on my HD.  I think it is \\"good\\", and after a hiatus of listening to it,  the album will trigger memories.  All PJ albums have this quality of triggering memories or bringing one back to the place they first spun the record.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|Got this the day it came out last year and have loved it ever since.  This is a return to their thrashier roots, which was evident on st anger.  While st anger had a poor production and was rather sloppy, the band thrashed it up again on that release.  One of the few that I know, that still enjoy it.  Well Death Magnetic saw the band bring back the amazing solos and thrash elements, with a decent production.  I think one of the big issues is kicking Bob Rock to the curb.  I feel he was most responsible for changing their sound.  Bring in Rick Rubin who basically says, guys listen to your first 3 records for inspiration for this new release.  That was just your life races out the gates and is pure thrash as is the closer My Apocalypse, which has a riff from Damage Inc. in there-towards the end-it's a great throwback to the early days.  Anyway the album is not perfect.  There is still some load moments and the middle of the cd has some parts that do drag.  However this is a great cd that is heavy and has James growling like he used to.
B002DKF47O|5.0|I've been a fan of Behemoth for about four years now. They're truly one of the best and most tightest and powerful death metal bands today. I've got both \\"Demigod\\" and \\"The Apostasy\\" which are both awesome albums and two of my favorites as well. For their latest full length release, 2009's \\"Evangelion\\" (their first with the mighty Metal Blade Records), Behemoth have returned, and they're no doubt more tighter, faster, and brutal than ever before. This album is an absolute brutal, raging, ripping, ferocious, and unrelenting blackened death metal tour de force that is like a towering inferno of pure epic brutality, and it's also the best album that Behemoth have to offer thus far, no question about it. The overall production here is just tight and incredible, of course with some help from Colin Richardson (Machine Head, Slipknot, Trivium, Napalm Death) who handles the mixing duties to make the band's performance more tighter and powerful than ever before. This album has all the classic traits that Behemoth are very well known for: Super angry demon-like vocals, incredibly tight drumming, fast raging and crushing guitars, phenomenal lyrics and songwriting, what more do you need? Nergal's vocals are more angry, ferocious and commanding than ever, he's like an angry beast being awaken from a deep sleep. The guitars are in top form here as both Nergal and Seth lash out brutal, chaotic, and heavy riffs, fast, fiery tremolo picking leads, and awesome mindblowing solos, while Orion soars high with thick, heavy basslines, and of course Inferno's drumming is just incredibly tight, furious and god-like with wild, rapid firing machine gun-like blast beats and maniacal, ripping double bass kicking. Words can't even describe how amazingly incredible Inferno is behind those drums, he's truly one of metal's best and most tightest drummers today.<br /><br />\\"Evangelion\\" starts off strong with the excellent opener \\"Daimonos\\" which boasts fiery machine gun-like blasting, brutal slaughtering riffs, vicious throat ripping roars, and a pair of killer solos to boot, while the menacing follower \\"Shemhamforash\\" features more angry, commanding vocals, terrorizing riffage and soloing, and more machine gun style drumming, and there's also some cool middle eastern-esque sitar noodling near the end. Track three \\"Ov Fire and the Void\\" is another one of my favorites here that continues the musical terror, and is highlighted by some bursts of fast tremolo picking leads in the beginning, and there's also lots of double bass pedal kick action throughout this song, and there's also a shrot but sweet melodic solo by Seth, and great vocals from Nergal as well. Other standout tracks here on \\"Evangelion\\" include \\"He Who Breeds Pestilence\\", \\"Transmigrating Beyond Realms ov Amenti\\", \\"The Seed ov I\\", and \\"Defiling Morality ov Black God\\" which all continue the hellacious intensity. \\"Transmigrating Beyond Realms ov Amenti\\" and \\"Defiling Morality ov Black God\\" are both wild and furiously vicious blast fests that are both highlighted by more of Inferno's tight and powerful machine gun-like drumming, and the incredible 8 minute closing song \\"Lucifer\\" which is growled commandingly by Nergal in the band's native language Polish. In all seriousness, this is an amazing closing song you must hear to believe. For an added bonus, we are treated with a bonus DVD which documents the making of \\"Evangelion\\" as well as the album photo shoot, which is great.<br /><br />The overall conclusion is that fans of death metal, black metal, blackened death metal, or just extreme metal period will be extremely delighted and blown away by \\"Evangelion\\". This album is definately Behemoth's best release thus far, and a true testament to their skills not only as musicians but as a whole band as well. It simply shows that these guys get better and better with every album the offer. This my friends is exactly how extreme death metal should sound like. Highly Recommended!!iffs, vicious throat ripping roars, and a pair of killer solos to boot, while the menacing follower \\"Shemhamforash\\" features more angry, commanding vocals, terrorizing riffage and soloing, and more machine gun style drumming, and there's also some cool middle eastern-esque sitar noodling near the end.

B0000DZEA1|5.0|As an avid Tolkien and Lord of the Rings fan, I know what makes the movies so moving and epic. The answer is the soundtrack by Howard Shore. Each track puts you right into Middle Earth with the Fellowship and sweeps you away in their journey. For anyone who loves the trilogy or just good heartwarming music, this soundtrack is for you.  CD came prompt and in perfect packaging and conditions. No complaits what-so-ever.

B001MYIQFE|4.0|When the Cars first came onto the scene they were more than just different. They brought some serious attitude to the music world.  While they may not be directly responsible for the new wave move they sure helped it out as a major driving force.  As the years went by The Cars continued to put out excellent material.  As far a pure pop sensibility \\"Heartbeat City\\" was their tour-de-force.  I still consider their first release, \\"The Cars\\" and \\"Heartbeat City\\" their finest moments in music.  As far as the disc goes.....it's pure gold!  No pun intended.  I have the original CD release and while it sounds, \\"OK\\", this disc blows it away.  If you are a true Cars fan then this disc is a must have on your dream list.
0307716988|5.0|first of all, when you open up the book, there is a drawing personally done by mj and when you flip another page there is his signature!    in the intro by berry gordy, he says, \\"michael jackson was not an artist who comes along once in a decade, a generation, or a lifetime. he was an artist who comes along only once, period.\\"    chapter 1 is \\"just kids with a dream\\" - talks about how his mom had polio, how she so much encouraged all her children's interests all she could, and how she instilled a love of God in mj. he talks about how his dad would always bring home donuts after working in the steel mill and how he was always a good protector. he talks about some of the things he feels in relationship with his dad, too, like not being real close to him because he was emotionally not there unless he was talking business. he talks about how his brother marlon used to play the bongo drums and then they got passed down to him and then to his other brother randy. i learned how hard they really worked hard as little kids in this family business and went on lots of trips to perform.    chapter 2 is \\"the promised land\\" - talks about his real respect for berry gordy, how he felt when he shook smokey robinson's hand for the 1st time (that fans really remember that 1st impression even if the artist doesn't), his love for diana ross, his real feeling of closenss with his brothers and how he became a cartoon to watch on sat mornings and how special that made him feel.    chapter 3 is \\"dancing machine\\" - talks about his trip to africa and how when they got off the plane at dawn there were all these africans in a line dancing for them to welcome them to the country and how he loved it, how they left motown, doing the wiz and how that felt to him and how he then met quincy jones to do his \\"off the wall.\\"    chapter 4 is \\"me and q\\" - talks about some of his girl relationships, how he really respects quincy jones and loved working with him, how success brings lonliness, how he got real emotional one time after singing \\"she's out of my life\\" and sobbed in the studio, how he walked the neighborhood looking for a friend, and how because \\"off the wall\\" only got one nomination for the best r&b vocal performance, it spurred him on to his next thing, which was \\"thriller.\\"     chapter 5 is \\"the moonwalk\\" - talks about how he really believed in wishes and he used to make a wish every time before he dove into the swimming pool and before the sun set all the way behind the sky, how very hard the making of the thriller album was and how excited everyone was when it was such a huge success, explains the how and why behind the songs on the album, how he felt before he did his big performance of \\"billie jean\\", and how he got talked into taking his sunglasses off when \\"thriller\\" won the award for best album.    chapter 6 is \\"all you need is love\\" - talks about the fire when he was doing the commercial for pepsi, the vicotry tour, the making of \\"bad\\", how it felt so awesome when everyone in the crowd would say and do the same thing as he would say and do on stage, his different relationships with his sisters, how someone named george lucas told him that his daughter's 1st words were \\"michael jackson\\" and how good that made him feel,what a perfectionist he was and how he was always trying to out-do himself, how he loved classical music, toys and gadgets, mexican food and was a vegetatian.    it also has tons of really nice photographs all through the book!!    i really learned a lot by reading this book and mj shares a lot of his personal feelings about things that happened in his life. i felt like he could've been right in front of me telling me his story - that's how great this book is! i say \\"a must have book for all fans!!\\"
0786868724|5.0|I enjoyed 'Tuesdays with Morrie' written 10 years ago, not really was a fan of 'The Five People You Met in Heaven', so when I saw this new book by Albom, I was a bit hesitant to be quite frank.      I started the book at 6pm, and by 9 pm I had read it cover to cover.  I was intrigued, mesmerized, inspired, and content with the read.  I think Albom again has captured what he has always had the ability to do: write about the human spirit.     I highly recommend the book to all.  Give it a try.

B0029358GM|5.0|Each Wilco album is unique and challenging.  My favorite is still ghost, but this one appeals to me in a different way.  Still somewhat in country type of style, but with some flavoring of alternative undertones.  I really enjoyed the music, but it left me wanting...as though they teased me, lured me... and then didn't totally appease my craving.  This was almost like watching the last episode in a series... then wham... clip hanger... you're awed by the experience, want to choke the writer for not bringing the line to a conclusion....but... but... you come back for more.

B001F6ZIXW|5.0|While spending a weekend in a hotel with a football crazed husband, I decided I needed to find something to keep me occupied for two days.  My daughter recently got me hooked on Sons of Anarchy Season Two.  When I checked to see if Season One was available I was thrilled to see it was on Amazon!  Not only could I watch the entire season instantly (without waiting for the DVDs), but it was also $5.00 cheaper than another streaming site!  Even after football was over, I found myself still watching the episodes.  The best part is the season remains in my Amazon video library to watch anytime.  Will definitely use this service often to watch my favorite shows.
B000UPGQQW|5.0|When is the last time you checked out \\"The Lost Boys\\"? Sometime during the Clinton administration probably? Well go back and re-visit this classic piece of 80's horror because if you are like me, you've forgotten just how fun this film can be!<br /><br />You have Keifer Sutherland chewing up scenery (and minor characters)as the leader of a motorcycle ridin' vampire clan decked out in a wardrobe straight out of MTV's The Headbangers Ball! You have the two Coreys at the top of their career, you have Jason Patric when it looked like he was going to have a career (hello \\"Speed 2: Cruise Control\\"!!???) and Jami Gertz looks smokin' hot....and oh yea, the guy that's not Keanu Reeves from \\"Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure\\" is here too!<br /><br />What's the basic story? Family moves to sunny California coastal town, with a kick ass amusement park on a pier, plenty of wierdos and a town which also happens to be known as the \\"murder capital of the world\\"! Unfortunately the oldest boy draws the attention of the local vampire clan, and before long he's not casting a solid reflection any more. It's up to his geeky little brother and two teenage Van Helsings named \\"The Frog Brothers\\" to stop the vampires before they destroy the family. Corny? You betcha! Awesome? Damn straight!<br /><br />And if things couldn't get better, just wait until you hear the soundtrack!! Okay, the oily body-builder guy playing the sax might be a tad too much, but it's the 80's what do you expect? The music is fantastic, and if you don't own the soundtrack on CD, please follow the links below, and pick that puppy up right away.<br /><br />So what more is there to say, if you were a child of the 80's..you must OWN this film. If you think Sexy vampires were invented when \\"Twilight\\" came out...think again. This is a great, fun film that has stood the test of time.

0316001821|5.0|This is an extraordinary and sensitively written book about a family's suffering  after the disappearance, and presumed death, of a family member, a beautiful, innocent 14 year old girl.  The story is narrated, from \\"her heaven\\" by Susie Salmon, who was the victim of a rape and murder.  The children in the family, a younger sister, Lindsey, and an even younger brother, Buckley, eventually learn to cope and get on with their lives after their grievous loss.  It is the father and mother who fall apart.  The father, Jack, becomes completely obsessed with the investigation of the presumed murder of his daughter, and ruins his health and emotional well-being in the process.  Abigail, the mother, cannot deal at all with Susie's death, suppresses her feelings and eventually abandons her husband and the rest of her family.    Susie, from her heavenly home, observes throughout the years, the comings and goings of her family members, and shares in their thoughts and feelings, as well as the various accomplishments of her siblings.  We can, therefore, depend on an accurate and heart felt narration of what is going on.  There is no doubt that Susie, deeply loves her family, and somewhat attempts to influence and ameliorate some of Jack and Abigail's self-destructive behaviors.  Susie also tries as much as she can to support the growing up processes of Lindsey and Buckley, as well as the self-discoveries of her friend, Ruth, and of Susie's boyfriend, Ray Singh.  While Ms. Sebold gives rather short shrift to how she finally deals with the perpetrator, I feel that this denoument works, because the novel primarily deals with the issues of love and reconciliation, rather than punishment.  That the author occasionally slips into over-sentimentality may be excused, because Ms. Sebold makes the after-life aspects of the story believable, and develops credible and sympathetic characters.  The book also affected me personally, having had to cope this past year with my intense grief overthe death of my beloved younger sister.
1906694168|4.0|***Forewarned is forearmed: this review contains a few plot points from the the previous books in this trilogy:<br /><br />[[ASIN:0307269981 The Girl Who Played with Fire]] ended with Mikael Blomkvist dialing for emergency help after he found a man with an axe in his head and fugitive-from-the-law Lisbeth Salander in extremely critical condition with a bullet in hers. [[ASIN:030726999X The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest]] begins with both Lisbeth and the man, Alexander Zalachenko, aka Karl Axel Bodin, being airlifted to Sahlgrenska hospital. After operations, both patients are placed in the same critical care wing, although the medical staff keep them isolated and under observation. Since they are mortal enemies, keeping them from attacking each other could be an impossibility if they wake up and can get mobile. Meanwhile, Sweden's law enforcers try to determine what charges should to be filed against them, and especially against multiple murder suspect Salander who has been the subject of a national manhunt.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Blomkvist, who used duct tape and clean sheets to keep Lisbeth's blood inside her before the medics took over, isn't allowed to see her. He has his own problems with the police however, who want to know about the gun in his possession and about exactly what happened at Bodin's Gosseberga farm. Mikael doesn't have all the answers and even those he does have, he isn't to fully disclose. He's infuriated at the keystone cops who refused to heed his warning about the immense danger -- even when trussed up -- presented by the third person he encountered that night, the giant Niedermann. And Blomkvist wants to get back to the headquarters of the magazine, Millennium, so he can get on with his investigation into who masterminded more than two decades of cover-up that allowed Zalachenko to commit untold crimes and Lisbeth to be placed into a psychiatric facility and then declared mentally incompetent as an adult. He's so busy that he doesn't even ask about how Lisbeth is doing for a while: \\"It dawned on him that he had not been worried about her. He had assumed that she would survive. Any other outcome was unthinkable.\\"<br /><br />Thus opens the final volume of the late Stieg Larsson's trilogy about the asocial girl with an eidetic mind (at least until her head wound), deep secrets that include her extraordinary computer hacker abilities, and her burning vigilante sense of justice. As in the previous books, quite a few epithets, some casual sex, lots of investigative journalism, and jags of violence/vengeance mark this novel.<br /><br />Broadly speaking, [[ASIN:0307454541 The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (Vintage)]] dealt with corporate greed and the violent secrets in the family of one of Sweden's magnates. Then, Larsson turned to exposing the underbelly of the sex trade in THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE. Now, the subject is violation of Sweden's constitution by a shadowy group. How can the media of which Blomkvist is such an integral part uncover and expose the corruption and the illegal activities that have gone unchecked for so long? Can Blomkvist cooperate with the horde of legitimate authorities also suddenly probing irregularities? Can he find a way to also communicate and work in tandem with Salander if she survives?<br /><br />In my review of THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE, I wondered whether the Salander/Blomkvist trilogy would conclude satisfactorily. I think it does. Many ongoing questions are resolved by the last page of THE GIRL WHO KICKED THE HORNET'S NEST. There is closure of sorts. Still, after I'd finished the last sentence, I couldn't help wondering what Larsson might have presented to us had he lived and been able to write the ten books he apparently envisioned. I can readily see an arc that only began in this trilogy which could have deepened and strengthened the bond between the taciturn woman who looks like a child and thought she was in love with Blomkvist and the journalist who, as his sister says, \\"...is completely irresponsible when it comes to relationships. He screws his way through life and doesn't seem to grasp how much it can hurt those women who think of him as more than a casual affair.\\" I would have liked to have witnessed that Salander/Blomkvist evolution. But the series does rest here at a natural stopping place, creating a decided contentment.rresponsible when it comes to relationships.

The more I listen to this soundtrack, the more I absolutely love it.  I am very much looking forward to seeing how the music is integrated into the film.  Awesome CD...worth the purchase!

The fateful decsion made by the four men that were inserted into Afghanistan that ultiamtley cost three of them their lives was based on the fear they had about making a bad politcal decsion not a rational military decision.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I used to enjoy Moonlighting more for the playful banter between Bruce Willis and Cybill Shepherd, even though the mysteries were mostly silly or transparent and frequently both.  Then they ruined it by sleeping together and spent too much time talking about the need to share feelings (I'm male - it shows in this review, huh?;-)    Castle manages to duplicate much of the fun of Moonlighting without the silliness.  It is a SERIOUS mystery show where the mysteries take time to unravel.  But the chemistry between Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic makes the screen sizzle and it is all great fun.    I actually look forward to the end of \\"Dancing with the Stars\\" (if I'm watching with my wife) or \\"The Big Bang Theory\\" (if I'm watching by myself) to watch this show.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|Accidentally it happens that an innocent and unsuspecting young woman is abducted by a masked terrorist who holds the nation's capital in his grip.  That's it.    And this screenplay was written almost ten years before its release.  The Warchawski brothers created THE MATRIX films first.  And in them all, Hugo Weaving; quite a step up, here, in my opinion, from those interminable, overwrought English pixie movies in elfin-babble starring Elija Wood and everybody else but him.      No, I don't need to have read any of the Lloyd/Moore graphic novels, I think.  There are so many of these masterpieces of literary comics around nowadays, and everybody's doing them.  But, a movie is still just a shadowplay.  Nevertheless, it is always an event to see John Hurt in anything: The inquisitive First Officer from ALIEN, or THE ELEPHANT MAN, or the distinguished seducer from LOVE AND DEATH ON LONG ISLAND, or HELLBOY's adoptive earth-father from the movie of the same name, or as the victim/narrator from 1984.  That man's got something hardly any actor has; he can absolutely grip you and convince you of what he's doing within five minutes of any story.  And you absolutely cannot forget him.  Not even remotely attractive, but fascinating.    The movie V has (English) political and even historical overtones, based as it is on Guy Fawkes Day -- that's the annual holiday the English celebrate the attempted destruction of Parliament -- but the dotty Baroness Thatcher is gone, nonetheless, though not forgotten, and Britain is now Labor and the flow of cash out of England to Enron in Texas has ceased.  One hopes.  But nobody need be aware of any of that on first watching.  V is very skillfully written, in that regard, so that whatever might slow things down to political mud wrestling is avoided, and the action is allowed to move at a brisk pace.  All the elements of the story; the Dictator and his cronies; the police; the constabulary SWAT goons; the unintended female hostage/victim/accomplice (the sympathetic, winsome Natalie Portman) and her abductor/guru/hero (velvet-voiced Hugo, always in disguise) are in evidence and work as a team to reveal the story as it tightens and coils toward its inevitable end.    V is very easy to watch and understand.  Exciting to look at, the story, it seems to me, is a meditation on this proposition:  Cromwell liberated England from its Monarch and its aristocracy, but the Parliament, once it was free to do so sold the people to the nobility which has kept them enslaved ever since.  The pertinent question is, what a nation would England be were the English people free to work for their benefit alone?  And that causes us to wonder what a nation the United States of America would be, were this nation allowed to prosper for the benefit of all its citizens, equally?

0061537969|5.0|I concur with most of the other reviews.  This was totally unexpected!  I don't even like dogs, but I loved this book.  The story line follows the rules of classic literature - not modern or existential like so many, yet the situation was current and believable.  The philosophy of the book is sweet, tender and profound.  The perspective is interesting too since much of is conjecture - just like our views in real life.  (Who really knows the full truth?)  It inspires too.  You'll want to be your better self after reading it.

0393324818|5.0|This is such a great book.  From an Australian's perspective I've always marvelled at the level of statistical detail and analysis that goes into American sport and this is surely the ultimate example.  It is incredible how a book largely about stats and a sport I don't really understand can be so incredibly interesting.    Not sure how they'll make a move about it though!
B002C1BHIO|5.0|We just recently purchased a 37\\" 1080p Panasonic Viera and had it hooked up to the cable box with the HDMI cable provided by our cable company.  I used the AmazonBasics cable and immediately noticed a slight improvement.  I switched back and forth several times to make sure, and no doubt, there was a slight improvement.    I was looking at the picture very close up to notice the improvement. From normal viewing range the improvement was less noticeable and had I not known I was switching quite possibly would not notice the difference.  My guess is that for larger HDTVs the difference would be more noticeable.      Would I have purchased the AmazonBasics for our HDTV based on the difference I noticed, probably not, although I am very glad I do have it. I have to be honest, now that I have seen the difference, I will be buying the AmazonBasics for all my HDMI cable needs in the future.  There is no denying the quality.    I would definitely recommend the AmazonBasics to anybody that has a fairly large HDTV, watches a smaller HDTV close up or has a lot of other electronics in the room.  Overall for the average user this is not a must have but for the high end or more discerning eye user this is a definite recommend.
B002T9H2L0|5.0|This is in regards to the Theatrical release of Inglourious Basterds.<br /><br />The movie is Tarantino's WWII epic. An outstanding international cast, some trumping shall I dare say, Pitt's performance, who was great with what he had to work with, I equated his performance with that when he starred in Snatch, which was an ensemble cast and he was just a small puzzle in a much larger picture. I must say same goes here, doesn't mean he doesn't bore you with his performance in Inglourious Basterds. Some will argue that there should have been more scenes with the Basterds, I disagree, the story was fine, where both plots do converge at the end.<br /><br />Christoph Waltz international actor, extraordinary as Colonel Hans Landa! If he doesn't get a Best Supporting Actor Nod then I don't know what to think of the Academy Awards any more.<br /><br />Melanie Laurent who plays Shoshannah, who survives when her family is murdered by the SS and Landa. She has plans of her own to get her revenge!<br /><br />The movie has Tarantino written all over it, dialogue, which can be long and winded at times, foot fetish, a  food scene ala Big Kahuna Burger but with a french dessert, A 1970s title card using same lettering that was in Kill Bill the male nurse and his yellow Truck what he has written on the back, I think we all know what that said.<br /><br />Revenge is the focal point, strong women characters such as Death Proof and Kill Bill movies are present.<br /><br />A scene reminiscent of the beginning of Reservoir Dogs, everyone at a table talking.<br /><br />And Tarantino's ode to movies, this guy is a walking talking Movie enclyclopedia and he doesn't mind showing his knowledge. He did the same in Reservoir Dogs, when Mr White, Mr. Orange and Mr. Pink and Nice Guy eddie are all driving and are discussing Pam Grier.<br /><br />Camera angle where it points up at the actors faces for a scene.<br /><br />Story broken into Chapters<br /><br />And his signature soundtrack, using a david bowie song for a WWII period movie.... how awesome.<br /><br />Tarantino takes a genre, specifically a \\"Men on a Mission\\"--- that's where the Basterds come in, takes a Revenge story and mixes it. I think it's a plot device just to move the story along, to be honest this could have been two movies, one just about the Basterds and one about Shoshanah.<br /><br />I believe Tarantino has said this is his spaghetti War movie, very heavily influenced by Leone and the spaghetti westerns, and borrowing title from the original Inglorious [...] which was strictly a \\"Men on a Mission\\" movie, that's all this movie has in common with that movie.<br /><br />This is Tarantino at his best, at his most top form, is it as great a Pulp fiction, I don't think it will ever come close, but it's better than Death Proof. I am definitely going to get the Blu Ray when it is released.<br /><br />The thing is with Tarantino he takes genres and bends them and mashes them to what he likes, look at the kill bill movies, took a revenge story with old Hong Kong grind house martial art flicks and mixed it, an ode to those kind of movies. And this is his ode to those WWII movies, and spaghetti Westerns.<br /><br />Why do we go see a Tarantino film? I tell you why I go, interesting characters, cool soundtracks, the dialogue, unique way of reinventing a genre... don't dare say he is unoriginal.... look at Hollywood, everyone in Hollywood is unoriginal. There's always remakes, re imaginings, sequels, prequels in the works. So don't dare say Tarantino is the same, he knows what he is doing, he knows his films are homages to what he grew up with and watched and who influenced him. For some reason he is fascinated with the 70's haha.<br /><br />Oh and if you guys ever wondered why the title is miss spelled here is a theory.... granted you have already scene the movie.... Pitt and the Basterds have captured a Nazi patrol, you see Pitt emerge and lays his rifle against the stone wall, you see the misspelling of the Inglourious Basterds... he's a good ole southern boy from Tennessee who apparently cannot spell a damn so that's how he thinks it's spelled hence the miss-spelling.hat's how he thinks it's spelled hence the miss-spelling.

B00003CXRM|5.0|The first time I saw this movie, I actually thought it was quite ridiculous. I think it was because the humor was so dry.<br /><br />I caught it on tv again one day which started my love affair with this film. I have probably seen it at least 100 times, if not more, and it gets funnier every time I see it.<br /><br />My only problems with it are: 1.the Woolsworth scene is terribly edited and 2. the last scene has the McGill family missing a kid. If you count their daughters going over the train track- there's one missing?<br /><br />My love for this film is that there is a quote for every issue in life:<br />When you wake up...\\"oh, my hair\\"; when you find yourself in trouble... \\"we're in a tight spot\\", having people problems...\\"only a fool seeks logic in the chambers of the human heart\\"; let someone down...\\"God forgive me\\"; how old you'll be in 50 years...\\"well, I'll only be 82\\"; come to spiritual knowledge...\\"come on in boys, the waters fine\\"; hostile towards cattle...\\"one thing I hate more than coppers is cows\\"; finished with an argument...\\"I've counted to three\\"; warn friends of impending danger...\\"do not seek the treasure\\"; and so on, and so on.<br /><br />The majority of my every day language comes from the lines in this movie and I find that is all the language I need.

0767817478|1.0|You know the put-downs:  rubber suits, cardboard buildings, bad dubbing, toy tanks.  If you are a G fan, then you will know what I am talking about.  It's been this way for a very long time.  Therefore, I find it ironic that when Hollywood, with all of its resources & talents, was given the chance to make a Godzilla movie with cutting edge spfx, all they could muster is this cheap imitation of 1950s monster movies.  Revision is not necessarily a bad thing.  Godzilla has been through changes (some good, others bad) throughout his long film career.  And, an American Godzilla should be different as there are different audience expectations in the States.  What would be the point of making this film a carbon copy of the Toho series with the only differences being the presence of American actors & CGI?  What IS wrong is taking an established & iconic character & ignoring everything that makes it distinctive.  The filmmakers themselves were very open about their disdain for the Japanese series, even trotting out the old chestnuts (see above).  It all seems like a bit of \\"I can't stand you but I wouldn't mind making money off you!\\" at play here.  Whatever the filmmakers rationale, the resulting film is terrible.  The cast performs in a perfunctory manner, delivering lame one-liners & mugging for the camera like this all one big joke.  As I stated before, the story is straight out of the Giant Creatures Plot Book circa 1958.  The highly touted spfx are okay but fail to impress.  Godzilla's new look also fails miserably, evoking neither pathos or fear.  I have heard people say that they are tired of hearing people bash this film.  I can understand that.  However, after years of watching Hollywood kick dirt in the face of the filmmakers who toiled on the Japanese series, I hope that you will forgive me for pointing out that that same foot is now sticking out of Hollywood's mouth.
0553385461|4.0|The book is a great read for those interested in a brief history and overview of modern physics.  Hawking uses simple language and basic metaphors to help any level of reader understand most difficult concepts.  The book chronicles the study of the stars beginning with the Greeks and every major scientific discovery in the field of physics.  Hawking also spends several chapters on the current models and theories of the universe.  He answers loads of difficult questions and helps the lay-man understand the Big Bang.  The last chapter talks about physicists' goal of finding a \\"Grand Unified Theory\\" which will reconcile the discrepancies between the quantum model and general relativity.   It was a quick read-only a couple of hours but very interesting and worthwhile.     The several attempts at humor were witty and acceptable, albeit dry or predictable. The main fault I found with the book was Hawking's inability to \\"change gears\\" from rudimentary, Newtonian physics to modern, multi-dimensional theories.  It feels like the superficial concepts were given unnecessary metaphors and paragraphs while the more interesting and complex aspects were too brief.  It seemed that on one page I could easily have skipped paragraphs because the point had already been made, processed and further metaphors were superfluous.  While on other pages I felt that every sentence was an encyclopedia of unexplained words and concepts.       Overall, the book is a fantastic read and the 4 star rating is well deserved.  I wouldn't spend time on it if you were moderately familiar with quantum theory and relativity.  There are many more books written by Hawking and others that will satisfy your curiosity to a greater extent.  I would certainly recommend the work to those unfamiliar with our universe and to those looking for a summary of current models and theories.  This book is welcome instruction from a true genius of our day.
0882709194|1.0|The explosion of knowledge and enlightenment that modern science brought into the world has shaped our society in more ways than anyone could possibly list, and one of the largest innovations off all time was this book here \\"Origin of Species.\\" It was highly controversial and still is to this day (even though it really shouldn't be). The research of Charles Darwin was the genesis of all modern biology and has contributed to, among many things, modern vaccinations and antibiotics. And as the world of science begins to slowly unravel the mysteries of life, from the vastness of the universe, to the structure of the atom, religion in all it's forms begins to retreat back into the gaps that science does not yet understand. However, some people who live in a society who's very foundations are based on scientific advancement would deny every single necessity and luxury of their lives while crediting a force for which no evidence exists. Ray Comfort, is such a man.    It should sadly come as no surprise to anyone even remotely familiar with the ministries of Banana Man and Mike Seaver (Kirk Cameron) that something like this has reared is moronic head. Using the influence of their 'Way of the Master' organization, whose name brings to mind a dark and sleazy BDSM club located in the wrong part of town, have added a 50 page forward which contains about as much scientific accuracy as \\"The Magic Schoolbus\\" series with all the educational parts cut out. From start to finish you will cringe in agony as Comfort tries to tie Evolution to Nazism and racism, while stopping along the way to, for the over 9000th time, repeat the bold-faced lie that \\"No transitional fossils have been found.\\" In between these face-palming inducing moments, Comfort tries to run what can best be described as a political smear campaign against Charles Darwin. Page after page attempts to paint Darwin as some kind of racist, sexist, misanthropic freak, which would have been better suited for a creationist Darwin bashing pseudo-biographical work, and not in a book containing Darwin's scientific findings.    There is absolutely no reason for anyone to pick up this version of Origin of Species when the fantastic version with the forward by Sir Julian Huxley exists. The fact that this forward even exists is an insult to the intelligence of anyone who reads it, as well as a spit-in-the-face of science itself. Pure lies and utter garbage.
0345337581|4.0|After reading a few of the horrible reviews for this book...I had to read it. It is amazing how personally offended the reviewers were/are that this book even exists. I don't understand their level of pure hatred/malice at this book.<br /><br />After reading this book, I now have one technique that fits a wide variety of circumstances. It is a single tool that can be used in a wide variety of situations. Even better, it works with the everyday.<br /><br />The main premise, like most memory books, is to force the reader to be aware in the moment of what they are reading. It goes on to explain that the reader can trust their mind to make the corrections.<br /><br />The author does not pretend to have a degree. In fact, he mentions several times that he does not. Mr. Lorayne avoids discussing the actual workings of the brain. He avoids theories about how we think. He stays away from evolution of the brain. Basically, anything you would find in college about the anatomy or theory of the brain or memory is NOT in this book.<br /><br />I found the technique to be very useful and accurate. There are plenty of applications from ranging from the serious to the more playful. However, it is always practical and easy. The most difficult part is coming up with some of the words needed for the sounds.

076532413X|4.0|This is not your ABC show trying to be the next \\"Lost\\"...<br /><br />Flashforward by Robert J. Sawyer, though the loose inspiration for the TV series of the same name, is not an unsolvable puzzle that with cliffhangers; it is a well thought through science fiction story about what happens when the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN goes online for its first 14TeV collision and blacks out the entire world sending their consciousness ahead more than 21 years into the future for a two minute glimpse at what is to come.<br /><br />When, in 2009, the scientists at the LHC run their first high energy experiment, at the very second the collision was to happen every mind on Earth flashes forward 21 years to 2030 for about two minutes where each person saw their future through the eyes of their future self. But, when everyone wakes up from the blackout, the world is in chaos as cars collided, plains crashed, and many people are dead.<br /><br />As the world struggles with the truth of what has apparently happened, the scientists at CERN have to come to grips with the likelihood that the LHC experiment caused the worldwide phenomenon; and grieve for the deaths that have hit all too close to home.<br /><br />What follows is an exploration into the nature of fate, free will, and what physics has to do with it all.<br /><br />Though Flashforward is an interesting and thought provoking book, it does suffer at times from a little too much metaphysical exploration at times (i.e. the universe can't exist without an observer).

Ray seeks to discredit Darwin through a myriad of logical fallacies and by presenting the typically contrived arguments against evolution. Ray's disagreement of Darwin/evolutionary theory can be summed up as \\"it doesn't corroborate with my religious convictions, therefore it is false.\\"    This forward provides nothing more than creationist propaganda and only serves to obfuscate a much more compelling body of work.
B001NXDSLQ|5.0|I saw it when it first came out.  Better film than I remember.  Forty years and music hasn't gotten any better.
B002P7UCMC|5.0|This is Rammstein's best release in a long time. Granted, Reise Reise is a great album, but Rosenrot was average at best, largely because it was nothing but tracks left over from the Reise, Reise sessions that were not good enough to get on the final cut. So, Rosenrot is not a true album but a collection of B-Sides and it did not have a tour. Liebe ist für alle da is the best release since Mutter or Sehnsucht which I regard to be their best two CDs and the experiments with their sound a la songs on later releases (Think acoustinc Los!). LIFAD is heavy, catchy, and overall just a great album! The only track that is less than perfect in my opinion is the song Pussy, which features less than thoughtful song writing. For those who understand German however, will understand that the song is not just a song about sex ( a la Rein Raus ) but a playful poke at the sex tourists (those who come to Europe for the drugs, prostitutes, etc) however I think that Till Lindemann should stay away from singing in English. Pussy is not a terrible song by any means, just the weaker point in the album.. But it picks right back up with the smashing eponymous song , Liebe ist für alle da and closes well with Roter Sand. the songs on the bonus CD are also great. GET THIS ALBUM! and if you know German, it is much easier to appreciate the music!
B0021L8UXU|4.0|I'll keep this review short. Woody and Jesse are great together in this movie. This movie is really hilarious and definitely worth seeing. Is it the best movie ever? No. Is it entertaining and hilarious? Definitely yes. I'm quickly becoming a fan of Jesse Eisenberg and I've always been a fan of Woody. This movie probably has one of the best cameo appearances I've seen in quite some time. Give it a chance. It's worth it.
B000002GIE|5.0|That's what this CD should really be called. I am sorry, Gery Cherone is probanly an immensely nice guy, he has good energy, I've seen him three times, twice with Extreme and once with Van Halen, the dude is putting fourth incredible effort performance wise but for some reason he doesn't do his lead guitarists proper credit. He has had two of the best in Nuno Bettencourt and Eddie Van Halen, and yet after the show he comes across as expendable. Somewhere after  the Pornogrffiti album his lyrics lost edge and while his energy during a concert can get hm through that with the help of a guitar god or two if you are not at a concert and listening to any CD he has done since then, he falls short. So lets go back in time to this debute CD.<br /><br />Now guitar aces became almost cliche in the 80's, everyone wanted to be the next Eddie and recreate the mark he made with Van Halens debut album. And some INCREDIBLE guitarists came out of the 80's as the result of these \\"hair bands\\" like Lynch, Bratta (please pck up a guitar again some day), Lee, Slash,just to name a few.  But what Eddie did with Van Halen's debut album is,well is there a better word for it than legendary? Please let me know because that one doesn't seem good enough. I don't know if anyone SHOULD have known at the time but they definitly DIDN'T realize Eddie was king. So had we not been so overwhelmed with all these new lead guitarists (and I am not complaining, I love good guitar play and skill, on a Les PAul, acoustic, banjo, whatever) then the emergence of one Nuno Bettencourt with an obscure band called Extreme would not go as unoticed as it did.<br /><br />In my opinion if  I had to pay to literally listen to one guy play guitar all day, 24 hrs, sun up to sundown there are 5 guys I'd do that for. 1.Eddie, 2.Mark Knoppler 3. Billy Gibbons 4. Eric Johnson 5. Nuno Bettencourt. I am not saying these are the best ever, well Eddie I am, I'll fight you for that one, but the others are purely personal tastes.  Nuno was the best to come out of a time when everyone was looking for the next Eddie and a LOT of great talent sufaced willing to try to be that. Granted if Randy Rhodes isn't taken from us so soon, Nuno may have only been the 2nd best, but not by far.<br /><br />Get this album! Get in on the emergence of one of the most incredible guitar talents you will ever hear. Then help me figure out what the #$%@ happened! This debut Cd then the Pornografitti album and all of a sudden its like he turns down the volume. The talent is still there and then some, you can tell on Extreme's following albums but it is only in glimpses. He does a little more in his solo albums but it is like he is trying to shun the guitar god image. KNOCK IT OFF NUNO!!!!!!!!!!! I don't want to hear Cherone's soft sensitiveand politically clever vocals, I want YOU to play the guitar like you got a pair plus a few spare sets hanging around down their. That's what you used to do. DO IT AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!t to come out of a time when everyone was looking for the next Eddie and a LOT of great talent sufaced willing to try to be that.

B0015XASFS|5.0|I went to see this live in CT, and loved every minute of it. The DVD lets me relive the concert... good quality and good memories.
B000000LZU|3.0|Great album, truly refreshing when you look back at the music from early 80s, this was one of those brilliant unnoticed \\"alt. rock\\" gems from back then. Had one issue though, on one of the tracks on the second disc it was actually stuck and i had to give my record player a little push for it to continue playing, and this was my first time playing it. So beware, you get what you pay for though - a decent pressing of a classic album.
B002MW50KO|2.0|I am going to be 41 years old.  And Bob Dylan was one of the reasons I picked guitar up in the early 1980's.  I saw him many, many times.  I loved his simple, yet powerful songs.  They weren't just bookmarks in the long story of pop culture in it's infancy, they were simply great songs.      So it was with surprise and happiness that I spotted Bob's newest offering to the world, a volume of Christmas songs, in the local record store.      And oh how the mighty have fallen.  If you're looking for a new way to listen to old favorites.  Well, I guess you got it.  But it's kind of like being sucker punched at a birthday party.  You thought it was going to be great, but you end up wishing you never went.      I applaud the fact that the proceeds of this album will go to charity.  At least this effort was not about the money.    ...That being said.  Bob's voice sounds like he had a bowl of broken glass for lunch before he sang these songs.  I'm sorry, I really wanted to like it.  It's just not going to happen.  Johnny Cash pulled off that gravely, admittedly sickly, voice in his twilight-of-life recording sessions.  They were endearing and heartfelt.  And there was a quality to his voice.  Bob didn't pull it off here.  Moreover, he chose classic songs that tend to chronicle anyone's life during December regardless of how old you are.  Bob's voice over these tunes just doesn't cut it.  Not unless you're a die-hard fan.    Play the samples here before you decide to plunk down the money.  If the song samples don't put you off, then jump right in.  The rest of the CD is just like it.
0767827902|5.0|Recently I've been working hard to compile my `Top 100 Films of All Time', a list that is completely subjective (I know) but one that is really important I think to any film lover.  We all have our favorite films, those that reach us, move us and emotionally complete us.  When constructing that list, one film made it fairly high; `The Last Picture Show'.  The first time I saw this film I was stunned.  I think a better way to say that is that I felt emotionally crippled.  It was a polarizing film that spoke to me in ways I wasn't prepared for.  The second time I saw this film I started to put a few things together and found myself moved to tears as apposed to merely frozen in the emotional shock of it all.  I've now seen this film a few handfuls of times and have grown to appreciate it more and more for it's each and every perfected cranny.<br /><br />There are not many films that I can say this about, but `The Last Picture Show' is utterly perfect.  It's not `nearly perfect' or `perfectly flawed' but this is absolutely PERFECT.<br /><br />`The Last Picture Show' is a delicately yet extremely precise telling of small town life through the eyes of a group of lost souls.  At the center of the group is young Sonny Crawford.  It seems as if everyone around Sonny is pulling at him, trying to absorb him in order to sustain their own survival.  Whether it is a subtle drain, from the likes of Sam (who treats Sonny like a son) and Lois Farrow (who seeps into Sonny through her daughter), or a significant one, like that from the likes of Ruth Popper (who needs Sonny to escape her marriage) and Jacy Farrow (who craves attention so much she'd use Sonny to get it), the fact remains that Sonny is not his own person but a prop used by those around him at their convenience.<br /><br />One of my friends mentioned his one grip with this film is that he felt it was `a bit too calculated to offer the perfect combo of nostalgia + criticism of a time' but I think I have to counter that with the thought that it is within that `calculation' that the nostalgia and criticism's can truly coexist.  Without that slight calculation (at times I admit it is stronger than others) I feel that the film might have come across rather uneven.  You have the warm feeling of `home' mixed with that cold feeling of `alienation' that needs to be read as sincere and earnest.  With the calculation comes a sharp sense of detachment that actually creates within itself a beautiful sense of emotional collapse that helps breathe a life into both of these aspects of the film.<br /><br />We understand the desperate desire to flee from the claustrophobic surroundings that trap and suffocate, but we also see and feel the fear of leaving such a place, for it is all these individuals know and, believe it or not, love.<br /><br />To me, the best example of this is found within Lois Farrow (beautifully played by Ellen Burstyn).  There is a scene where she speaks to Sonny about Sam, and you can see in that one scene very real layers of grief stripped away from her as she reminisces of the good times, with tears and smiles.  It is such a natural and genuine performance (best in show and clearly should have won the Oscar) that sums up the soul of the film for me.<br /><br />This is a story of the need to break free from all the binds, yet the need to remember all that kept one alive.<br /><br />Across the board, the acting is fantastic.  Aside from Burstyn there is Ben Johnson, who delivers such a beautifully sincere portrait of small town life.  He is the powerful presence that reaches all whom he touches.  Jeff Bridges is wonderfully used here, exhibiting all sorts of star-making bravado without ever once appearing to be an actor.  Cybill Shepherd is not just a pretty face here, as some have claimed.  Her quiet agony over the lack of love she receives from her family is seen in many scenes, and the joyous expression she wears when she seems to feel their love is just outstanding.  A quiet and often overlooked performance is Eileen Brennan, who is just beautifully honest as Genevieve, and of course Cloris Leachman's Oscar winning performance is THAT GOOD (even if Burstyn was better).  Her complete reclusion into her sadness is emotionally battering, and the way she controls such a dramatic presence is astounding for such a comedic firehouse.<br /><br />Timothy Bottoms is the center of the film, and sadly because of that he becomes more of a canvas than a substantial force.  He delivers beautifully, but he is more an observer and thus makes less of an impression than the supporting cast that engulfs him.  His performance for me is reminiscent of Brad Pitt's in `The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' in that respect, but he gives a fuller and more memorable performance than Pitt.<br /><br />In the end, I have to urge you to see this film if you have not already.  There are few films that can capture so much with such ease.  Every time I watch this masterpiece I am brought to another place and time and given something new to chew on.  The more I see it, the better it gets, and that's impressive for a film that really can't get much better!nnan, who is just beautifully honest as Genevieve, and of course Cloris Leachman's Oscar winning performance is THAT GOOD (even if Burstyn was better).

B000BJS4OY|5.0|The folks who nay-say the Boss usually go for the throat with remarks like, \\"sentimental, pretentious, one-dimensional, etc.,\\" but, to me, those and similar adjectives could describe much of popular music anyway, expecially these days. I think that unless you're talking about field recordings, most of the \\"music has to be authentic\\" arguments are a shuck. Music doesn't HAVE to be anything except able, somehow, to make a connection with the listener, on whatever level, and we listen or not in direct proportion to how that connection is established. I just wanted to get the \\"authentic\\" straw man out of the way before I comment on BORN TO RUN.<br /><br />I've liked some Springsteen albums better than others, but I keep coming back to this one because of that inexplicable connection. I didn't grow up in South New Jersey, skip school, go racing in the streets, etc.., but when I hear a song like \\"Thunder Road,\\" yeah, I do relate to wasting my \\"summer praying in vain /for a saviour to rise from these streets,\\" or listening to a high school buddy learning to make HIS guitar talk. On this album, Bruce Springsteen performs the same magic that Brian Wilson and Mike Love did in the early Beach Boys recordings: he makes you feel like you're part of a teenage past completely concocted from his experience/imagination. Oh, there are probably places where shared experiences match up, but that's not really the point. I suspect that one reason that BORN TO RUN works so well---besides the fact that musically it's superb---is that those who like it can imagine themselves in Springsteen's narratives, or at least be in sympathetic accord with them. And if you aren't, no question, you're going to find it over-the-top.....but a little over-the-top never hurt anybody.<br /><br />The extras with this 30th anniversary set are all worth the money, especially if your a behind-the-music documentary junkie. But, end of the day, it's the album they are built around that I keep returning to, and it sounds as good on the car stereo now as it did back in the day...and \\"authentic\\" be damned!n the car stereo now as it did back in the day...and \\"authentic\\" be damned!
1591391105|2.0|My mama always says, \\"you never get a second chance to make a first impression\\".  This is something that every new leader should keep in mind on their first days on the job.  Watkins has a strong premise - recognize that the first 90 days in a new job are critical.  You must fast track your learning curve, fit into the corporate structure, create a few coalitions, build a team, achieve alignment and negotiate success.  Hmm, that stuff sounds really familiar - been there done that - in many other business/leadership books.<br /><br />This book falls short by using every buzzword in the current system and failing to capture the full attention of the reader.  Neither does it offer practical solutions to avoid the pitfalls of negative transitions.  The majority of this information can be obtained by the companies Human Resources Director or good co-worker.  Reading this book is like watching paint dry - if it's your weekend project the excitement may be there for the first wall but after that you might as well have someone else come in finish the job (just how I felt about reading this book).
B002S0OBFK|1.0|I should have known better.  I should have listened to my \\"gut\\" feeling, but, alas, I happened to catch Roger Ebert's GLOWING review of this picture.  Sooooo...off I went to the theater.<br /><br />Guys, I don't want to spoil anything for anybody, but this movie BLEW CHUNKS.  It was NOT scary; it was NOT creepy--even \\"mildly\\" as another reviewer put it.  It is a movie in the same vein as the original \\"Blair Witch.\\"  I just think the hype got out on this movie BEFORE it was found out it was also a hoax.<br /><br />Now, I will say that I found the acting very good and the few effects were pulled off very well.  It is rated \\"R\\" for language--and language ONLY.  Yet, you'll be surprised there's little of that, as well.  There is no gore, no \\"body count\\" to worry about, and no hockey-masked killer.  Unfortunately, it's all the time in between that will have you nodding off.  You wanna' talk silly:  these people lived in San Diego, CA, yet they would have you believe there's only ONE demonologist in southern California!  Hell; there's one on EVERY CORNER. When they finally decide it's time to get out of Dodge, they want the audience to feel it's too late.<br /><br />And it was--too late for me or anyone else in the audience to give a hoot about this bomb of a movie.  All I read and heard about how everyone in the audience was freaked out, and \\"good luck going to sleep tonight,\\" and all that other hype is just that:  HYPE.  The ONLY thing that freaked me out about this movie was that it supposedly was shot over a 6-week period--and these two people NEVER changed their bed sheets!  Now THAT'S scary...
0061885452|5.0|I read Craig's book \\"Between the Bridge and the River\\" and loved it.  If he ever wants to give up his night job, this guy has a career as an author!  His autobiography, \\"American on Purpose\\" was great.  He's incredibly honest and revealing about his life.  I've always enjoyed watching him on his show, but now after reading about him, I'm enjoying the show more than ever! He has a terrific sense of humor.  Read the book, learn more about Craig and if CBS doesn't give him the 11:30 time slot when his boss, David Letterman, retires.....they are NUTS!
B00005T7I1|5.0|Who would have thought that they could take the original Dick Tracy comics and faithfully turn it into a full-length movie? It's a fun movie, with some outstanding performances from an all-star cast. Warren Beatty, Madonna, Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, Kathy Bates, Paul Sorvino, James Caan, William Forsythe, and more. Many of them have excessive make-up in order for them to look exactly like the characters in the comics. Pacino is probably the only one that does not look like the original character (\\"Big Boy\\" Caprice), since he created the design himself! But the actors and the characters that they portray aren't the only good things in this movie. We also have some stunning set designs, provocative cinematography, a near-perfect score from Danny Elfman, and some pretty dark humor. Although it's not as epic as the original Batman by Tim Burton, it still is a fun and beautiful film. Kudos to Beatty and everyone else involved in the film.
0385504225|1.0|I was REALLY looking forward to this book. I pre-ordered it for my Kindle and was SO excited when I got up in the morning and it was waitiing for me. Excited, that is, until I started reading it. About half way through the book I remember thinking \\"Okay! Okay! I get it the Masons helped found this country and yes they're a super secret organinzation...is that all you have?\\"    I never felt any of the real suspense that I felt in Brown's other books. The story didn't pull me in like some of his other books. Overall I was PROFOUNDLY disappointed with this book.    D
B002LIKMB6|4.0|This is a very different from what Shakira has ever done. It is very dancey and heavy with beat. There are a couple of tracks like \\"Gypsy\\" and \\"Spy\\" that will have you wondering what the heck she was on when she was writing/producing. Other than those two tracks, the album blends together well and is a cohesive dance extravaganza! It will definitely have you howling! Auuuuuuuu!
B002KSPKRS|5.0|This headset (Earforce x41) is comfortable to wear and the sound is fantastic! I can hear nuances in the games that I'd never heard before. For multi-player first person shooters you can really pin point where people are coming from - now if only my reflexes were better!     Have had these about a week so can't speak to longevity yet. But they hooked up easily, sound great and are comfortable.    A couple things to be aware of...  1 - there is a low level hiss when everything is silent. It doesn't annoy me when the game's sounds are on but it is definitely there during the silent times. I did try changing the frequency channel of my wireless router just to see (one reviewer had mentioned this) but it made no difference for me.  2 - The optical output is no longer coming standard on cables with new XBOX 360s. I have an older one with it included in the component cable and also an additional cable for audio use when using HDMI out. But without it you can also hook it directly to the optical out of your HD tv if using HDMI from XBOX to TV. Just wanted to make anyone who has a newer (post price drop) 360 that the optical output is not included in the cabling any more.  3 - when first hooking it up, the chat function seemed to echo and not work correctly. It turned out to be the cable into the headset from the controller wasn't all the way snapped in. I certainly thought it was at first but really click it in there and it has been fine ever since.    Do wish the chat function was also wireless, but I guess we can't have everything. I'd gotten used to using the 360 wireless earpiece and having the connecting wire back is an adjustment again. However a small price to pay for this sound!
B002SJIO54|2.0|Commercials on TV created a great hype for this movie. What a disappointment it was. First, entire movie was filmed like TV citcom office style, you know, reality show image. Cameras following one person and this person talking to audience. There you have it. Now, include some liberal politics and agenda into this mix, you have district 9!!!<br />An alien ship comes and parks over Nigeria. It turns out bug like aliens, their ship broke and they need refuge. They are placed in an isolated camp!!! called district 9. And many humans do not want them there, but socialist government( you will discover this as you watch) wishes to offer eaual opportunity to these aliens. So, plans are drawn to move aliens from district 9 to another location but this move CANNOT be done, unless aliens agree and sign moving documents!!!! A group of government employees are assigned to go in district 9 and get aliens sign these documents. Mind you that all these are happening in reality show style. During this operation, lead person( same guy is talking to cameras), finds a can of liquid and this liquid sprays on his face. This starts a genetic mutation on this guy. I can't even type this, soo bad...Well, as this guy slowly becoming an alien, plot thickens and he befriends with another alien who is trying to fix their broken ship and go home. Meanwhile, government is very much interested in this guys mutation into alien from human form. So, they are after him, while he is trying to help this one alien to fix his ship. Aliens has superior weapons and huge fire power. Easily they can over power humans but no alien ever touches any gun. Some reason, they are extremely peaceful, yet have those deadly weapons!!!!, our guy, who is muating into alien can now use alien weapons since these weapons bio-genetically locked. Anotherwords, you must be alien to use them. Again, some reason, our mutant boy is also hesitant to use these weapons against anyone. he cries alot, becauase his feelings get hurt and he is in distress when he faces crisses. Take my word for it, RENT IT first from redbox for a dollar to see if you like it. Horrible movie....By the way, at the end, he turns into full alien and the only alien who he help to fix the huge ship rest of the aliens came in. This alien fixes the ship and takes off. He does NOT take any other alien with him. And remaining aliens moves into another camp, their number increases in a decade form 200K to 2.5 million.is in distress when he faces crisses.

B002KDUDG6|5.0|Canadian music artist Michael Bubl&eacute; returns with his fourth studio album \\"Crazy Love\\" which the crooner calls it the \\"ultimate record about the inevitable roller coaster ride of relationships\\".  The first single \\"Haven't Met You Yet\\" was released back in August and has received success in the UK charts.<br /><br />But here we are with a brand new album since his third album \\"Call Me Irresponsible\\" (2007) and for the most part, I have to say this is my favorite album from Bubl&eacute; yet!<br /><br />The album kicks off with a cover of Julie London's 1955 hit song \\"Cry Me a River\\", a wonderful song which Bubl&eacute; gives almost a 007 James Bond arrangement.  And it works!  Julie London's version is very sensual from a female vocalist but Bubl&eacute; gives the song a machismo rendition that makes the track standout.  Definitely one of my favorite tracks on the album.<br /><br />The second track \\"All of Me\\" written back in 1933 by Gerald Marks and Seymour Simmons (and covered a gazillion times since) features a nice big band arrangement and overall, another solid cover on the album.<br /><br />The third track \\"Georgia on My Mind\\" written back in 1930 by Hoagy Carmichael and Stuart Gorrell (and made famous by Ray Charles in 1960) features a gentle, piano-driven track.  A classy rendition by Bubl&eacute;.<br /><br />The fourth track \\"Crazy Love\\" is a cover of the classic 1970 Van Morrison classic and a song that Bubl&eacute; named the album after.  A pop style that definitely sounds retro and different from any of his other tracks on the album.<br /><br />The fifth track \\"Haven't Met You Yet\\" is an original track written by Bubl&eacute;, Alan Chang and Amy Foster.  Catchy, fun and overall a good choice for the first single to be released off the album.<br /><br />The sixth track \\"All I Do is Dream of You\\"written by Nacio Herb Brown and Arthur Freed back in 1934  and a song that has been covered a good number of times.  Another fun big band track on the album.<br /><br />And the seventh track \\"Hold On\\" is another original track on the album which is more or less a mellow piano-driven track.<br /><br />The eighth track on the album \\"Heartache Tonight\\" is a cover of the popular 1979 Eagle's song.  Bubl&eacute; gives a brass/blues/rock/big band hybrid cover of the song.<br /><br />The ninth track \\"You're Nobody till Somebody Loves You\\" is a 1944 track by Russ Morgan, Larry Stock and James Cavanaugh known for Dean Martin's cover.  Bubl&eacute; does a great job of creating a romantic, big band version of the classic hit.<br /><br />The tenth track \\"Baby (You've Got What It Takes)\\" from 1960 is originally sung by Dinah Washington and Brook Benton and for this cover, Bubl&eacute; teams up with Sharon Jones and The Dap-Kings for a nice big-band version of the hit song.<br /><br />The eleventh track is Bubl&eacute;'s cover of the popular hit song \\"At This Moment\\" by Billy Vera.  Bubl&eacute;'s version is a bit more elegant while Vera's was just nightclub raw...but it's a good version, but I suppose Vera's version brings more of that 80's angst.<br /><br />The twelfth track \\"Stardust\\" (the 1927 song composed by Hoagy Carmichael and lyrics by Mitchell Parish) features Bubl&eacute; and Naturally 7 and has that old school 1930's-1940's style of harmony.  A solid cover!<br /><br />The final track on the album is \\"Whatever It Takes\\" featuring Ron Sexsmith (aka the one-man jukebox).  A nice, upbeat jazzy track.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Crazy Love\\" is definitely my favorite Michael Bubl&eacute; album yet.  The covers are solid and of course, the musical arrangements go well with his vocals.  Definitely an album that will stay on your playlist for a long time and an album that is highly recommended!mellow piano-driven track.

B002OOG6RQ|5.0|\\"Liebe ist fur alle Da\\" is just as surprising as the early critics said it would be. Rammstein comes back with more talented drumming and vocals than I ever expected. The guitars are still simple and straight-forward, but that doesn't mean the music isn't full of personality.    The music is the most mature and professional that Rammstein has played so far. Till goes out there briefly with short death growls in a couple tracks and in intervals throughout the album he showcases very melodic singing even better than in \\"Mutter\\". The rest of the vocals are all \\"Herzeleid\\" and \\"Reise, Reise\\"-style shouting.     The production on this album is the greatest thing. The music is the clearest and cleanest that I've heard from an industrial band. The bass guitar is clearly audible, the snare and bass drums have that authoritative, sensual pounding again and Till's vocals, while occasionally swallowed by the guitars, fit perfectly with the music.    It's impossible for me to compare it with other music because... it's Rammstein. They don't really fit in with other bands. But within Rammstein's own discography, if this album isn't their best it's a tie with the best.    The catchiest songs with the most replay value are \\"Ich tu Dir Weh\\", [...],  \\"Weidmanns Heil\\", \\"Wiener Blut\\", \\"Frueling in Paris\\" and \\"Mehr\\". [...] is silly and obnoxious, but when it's stuffed in with the rest of the album, it becomes fun, and the sense of humor shows. The way you felt about the songs \\"Reise, Reise\\" and \\"Ein Lied\\" is probably the way you're going to feel about \\"Rammlied\\" and \\"Roter Sand\\" respectively.     \\"Rammlied\\" deserves a fair chance to be considered as a creative and brooding, updated themesong for the band. The bits of choir and Gregorian-esque delivery of the opening lyrics are very stylish and add atmosphere to the opening track.    \\"Frueling in Paris\\" has a great, heart-warming melody, and while it may not be Beethoven, coming from Rammstein it's a special song.    \\"Fuehr Mich\\" and\\"Donaukinder\\" on the second CD are very melodic and moving (and hey, there's even a slow solo on the latter), and \\"Halt\\" is a good song to round the second cd out with.    Every song on this album is classy, and dark, in spite of the strangely bright and vibrant choruses. Again, the production is beautiful.    I recommend spending the extra dollar (I mean seriously...) on the 2 disc version versus simply buying the regular package... The re-hashes of \\"Roter Sand\\" weren't that interesting to me but \\"Fuehr Mich\\" and \\"Donaukinder\\" are gorgeous and indispensible songs that I loved after one play-through.    Summary: Buy the album. It sounds great, but expect changes in the band toward a more \\"melodic\\" aggressiveness... and the 2-Disc edition is definitely worth the extra buck. Oh, and play this on a nice sound system if you can, you're robbing the music otherwise. Youtube sounds nothing like this. =P    <3,  -yardy249
B002FRNCG0|5.0|The Grammy Award nominated band from Tennessee consists of Hayley Williams (lead vocalist/keyboard), Josh Farro (lead guitar and background vocals), Jeremy Davis (bass guitar), Zac Farro (drums) and Taylor York (rhythm/lead guitar).<br /><br />The band definitely came out fierce with their second album \\"Riot!\\" which grabbed the attention of American and UK media in 2007 and in 2008, garnered even more fans as the band's music was featured in the film \\"Twilight\\" and their song \\"Decode\\" was the lead single from the soundtrack (their other song \\"I Caught Myself\\" was also featured on the album).<br /><br />But now the band returns with their third full-length album titled \\"brand new eyes\\" produced by Rob Cavallo.  Back in July, when the band released their first single from the album titled \\"ignorance\\", I felt that Paramore has just raised the bar for their music as I was very impressed by the single and easily, highly anticipating the release of this album.<br /><br />There is just something about Hayley Williams that really brings some excitement to the band's music.  It's almost hypnotic in someway but from the first track \\"Careful\\" to tracks such as  \\"Ignorance\\", \\"Brick by Boring Brick\\", \\"Where the Lines Overlap\\" and \\"All I Wanted\\"... her vocals takes these songs to a higher level and combined with the music, just on my first listen to this album, I can easily tell how \\"brand new eyes\\" just stood out from the band's previous releases.<br /><br />But the allure of Paramore's music is not limited to just the faster, heavy hitting tracks.  There is also magic within the slower tempo tracks and these tracks are definitely where your mind tends to zero in on William's brilliance as a songwriter.  The lyrics on this album are well done and  tracks such as \\"Playing God\\", \\"Turn It Off\\", \\"The Only Exception\\" and \\"Misguided Ghosts\\".<br /><br />In fact, those who have fallen for Williams lyrics were quick to take advantage of purchasing the limited deluxe box edition of \\"brand new eyes\\" (limited to 15,000 copies and all were sold out in the United States) and features two bonus tracks and a 40-page hardcover book with Hayley's handwritten lyrics and notes on the album.  In addition, to a 7' yellow vinyl album with an acoustic version of \\"ignorance\\" and \\"where the lines overlap\\", a DVD and more.<br /><br />Overall, \\"brand new eyes\\" is a magnificent album.  It's one thing to enjoy all songs on the album but in repeated listens, your mind starts to notice all the other elements in this album.  From the vocals, the music, the songwriting but also the sheer emotion.  Just listen to the track such as \\"All I Wanted\\" and the song absolutely touches your soul.  Personally it's not hard to fall in love with this Paramore and just to think that this band is young and still has much more music to give.<br /><br />Paramore's \\"brand new eyes\\" has set the bar much higher as this album is just fantastic from beginning to end.

B002P7UCMC|5.0|\\"Liebe ist fur alle Da\\" is just as surprising as the early critics said it would be. Rammstein comes back with more talented drumming and vocals than I ever expected. The guitars are still simple and straight-forward, but that doesn't mean the music isn't full of personality.    The music is the most mature and professional that Rammstein has played so far. Till goes out there briefly with short death growls in a couple tracks and in intervals throughout the album he showcases very melodic singing even better than in \\"Mutter\\". The rest of the vocals are all \\"Herzeleid\\" and \\"Reise, Reise\\"-style shouting.     The production on this album is the greatest thing. The music is the clearest and cleanest that I've heard from an industrial band. The bass guitar is clearly audible, the snare and bass drums have that authoritative, sensual pounding again and Till's vocals, while occasionally swallowed by the guitars, fit perfectly with the music.    It's impossible for me to compare it with other music because... it's Rammstein. They don't really fit in with other bands. But within Rammstein's own discography, if this album isn't their best it's a tie with the best.    The catchiest songs with the most replay value are \\"Ich tu Dir Weh\\", \\"B********\\",  \\"Weidmanns Heil\\", \\"Wiener Blut\\", \\"Frueling in Paris\\" and \\"Mehr\\". \\"Pussy\\" is silly and obnoxious, but when it's stuffed in with the rest of the album, it becomes fun, and the sense of humor shows. The way you felt about the songs \\"Reise, Reise\\" and \\"Ein Lied\\" is probably the way you're going to feel about \\"Rammlied\\" and \\"Roter Sand\\" respectively.     \\"Rammlied\\" deserves a fair chance to be considered as a creative and brooding, updated themesong for the band.

And Halt is another good metal song to round up the disc.    Every song on this album is classy, and dark, in spite of the strangely bright and vibrant choruses.

B002PY86WI|5.0|When it comes to best albums, typically one can be critical of them if the right songs are not on it.  Especially when it comes to legendary artists and in this case, Madonna with her latest and third best compilation titled \\"Celebration\\".<br /><br />There are two versions available digitally of \\"Celebration\\", an 18-track standard edition and a 36-track Deluxe Edition.  Some online music stores offer remixes of \\"Celebration\\" and \\"It's So Cool\\" for a total of 37 or 38 tracks.<br /><br />Focusing on the Deluxe Edition (with someone with a long musical career such as Madonna, 18-tracks are simply not enough), the album consists of her hits from the 80's up to the present.  Back in March, Guy Oseary (manager of Madonna) encouraged fans to Twitter what songs they wanted to see on the album.  And also announced by her publicist Liz Rosenberg, that there would be new tracks included on the album.  And the album also marks the final album release through Warner Bros., the label that she has been with for 27-years.<br /><br />But \\"Celebration\\" (Deluxe Edition) is simply a wonderful release of Madonna's music from  1983-2009.  From classics such as \\"Borderline\\", \\"Like a Virgin\\", \\"Into the Groove\\", \\"Material Girl\\", \\"Dress You Up\\", \\"La Isla Bonita\\", \\"Live to TEll\\" and so much more including her more recent hits such as \\"Hung Up\\" and \\"4 Minutes\\".<br /><br />As for the new tracks, included are the tracks such as her latest single \\"Celebration\\" which has been a hit in many countries.  Also, included is the song \\"Revolver\\" featuring a collaboration with Lil Wayne.  And of course, if you want more Madonna goodness, a \\"Celebration\\" DVD release is also available with 47 of her music videos.<br /><br />Overall, there is nothing bad you can say about this best album.  It literally includes all her top selling hits that was released.  Needless to say that a large part of her successful music career is celebrated through this latest release.  Of course, there are some tracks that slipped the cracks or perhaps fans didn't vote for them (\\"Angel\\", \\"True Blue\\", \\"Deeper and Deeper\\", \\"Rain\\", \\"I'll Remember\\", \\"Bedtime Story\\", \\"Human Nature\\", \\"You'll See\\", \\"What It Feels For a Girl\\", \\"Die Another Day\\"), but I'm guessing that there were no plans to go for a third disc on the album.<br /><br />Nevertheless, personally, the essential Madonna releases that I have long enjoyed are included on this album and I think that those who grew up with this magnificent performer would agree that this is a solid release.  For Madonna fans looking for a great collection of her music, \\"Celebration (Deluxe Edition)\\" is highly recommended!for them (\\"Angel\\", \\"True Blue\\", \\"Deeper and Deeper\\", \\"Rain\\", \\"I'll Remember\\", \\"Bedtime Story\\", \\"Human Nature\\", \\"You'll See\\", \\"What It Feels For a Girl\\", \\"Die Another Day\\"), but I'm guessing that there were no plans to go for a third disc on the album.

0882709194|1.0|Amazon is mixing the reviews for different versions the 150th edition of Origin of Species.  The version with the preface by Ray Comfort includes creationist nonsense and should be avoided. The version that includes the preface by Julian Huxley is worth owning.
B0024FAG6M|5.0|In 1969, the film \\"Easy Rider\\" debuted with much fanfare in America.  Not only would the film receive distinction as an important film that depicted the late 60's in America but it would be the first Independent film to be created with a low budget (under $400,000) and made $19 million dollars in the box office.  And help install confidence for the film studios that a Independent films can be successful and also a film created on a low budget can be successful as well.  Not only that, the film would be groundbreaking in that it used contemporary rock music at that time by The Jimi Hendrix Experience, The Byrds, Steppenwolf and more.<br /><br />\\"Easy Rider\\" would star very good friends Dennis Hopper (\\"Colors\\", \\"The Last Movie\\", \\"Hoosiers\\") and Peter Fonda (\\"The Last Movie\\", \\"South Beach\\", \\"3:10 to Yuma\\") in which Hopper would direct and Fonda would produce.  The two also wrote the film along with Terry Southern (\\"Barbarella\\", \\"Casino Royale\\", \\"The Telephone\\").<br /><br />The film revolves around two bikers Wyatt (Fonda) and Billy (Hopper) who begin the movie by smuggling drugs from Mexico to Los Angeles and making a very good profit.  With the money, the two can do what they want and that is to go on a on a road trip on their Harley Davidson choppers and drive to New Orleans, Louisiana for Mardi Gras.<br /><br />Wyatt hides the money in his motorcycle's gas tank and the two embark on a trip enjoying the scenery and the freedom of traveling America.  Throughout the trip, we see the two drive and see the scenery of the trees, mountains and the open road way with popular music at that time.<br /><br />During their trip, they encounter a hitchhiker (Luke Askew, \\"Manhunter\\", \\"The Quest\\") who they pick up and drive to a hippie commune.  Then the two end up driving through a parade in which they don't have a permit and end up being put in jail.  This is where they meet ACLU lawyer George Hanson (Jack Nicholson, \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\", \\"Terms of Endearment\\", \\"As Good As It Gets\\") and learn that he is a drunkard but has always wanted to go to Mardi Gras.<br /><br />So, when the two are released, they head out to New Orleans but what they don't expect is that what may have seem like freedom so far, until they hit certain areas they learn that people's perception of them are different.  People with long hair or people wearing leather pants are being looked at as \\"hippie queers\\" and the prejudice runs deep in those parts of America.<br /><br />\\"Easy Rider: 40th Anniversary\\" was hailed by Time Magazine as \\"one of the ten most important pictures of the decade\\" and entered the Library of Congress National Registry in 1998 because the film showcases America during that volatile time back in the late 60's.<br /><br />The independent film was also quite volatile behind-the-scenes as Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda who were close friends at the beginning of the film, because of the demands of the film, the two had a falling out.  The film featured a lot of fighting between the crew, there was a lot of drug use with not only the cast but also the crew.  In fact, some of the scenes used on the film, the talent were wasted on marijuana and some have said that it was remarkable how much the actors were able to work while high on drugs.<br /><br />The famous choppers that the two drove, although there were four total, two for backup.  The person in charge of watching over the choppers, Tex Hall, had a robbery attempt at his home with a shotgun on him and his girlfriend and the motorcycles were stolen.<br /><br />And as for the people in the small towns, Hopper used actual people not actors and thus what we are truly seeing in the film are real reactions by Southerners in Louisiana reacting to the men who had long hair (Hopper) and Fonda's black leather pants.  These were just a few things that happened behind-the-scenes of \\"Easy Rider\\".<br /><br />Needless to say, \\"Easy Rider\\" is definitely a time capsule for that moment of time and not onlydo you get the film, you also get the \\"Easy Rider: Shaking the Cage\\" in which viewers get to learn from each cast and crew of how volatile things were while shooting the film and things that happened behind-the-scenes that will definitely surprise people.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"Easy Rider\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1) for the first time.  For a film created back in 1968, the film looks absolutely great, not perfect but still great.  No blemishes and certain outdoor scenes look absolutely fantastic and for a film 40-years-old, I have to say that it looks better than many films that I have seen released back in the 1980's and 90's.  Grain is kept and for the most part, detail of the chopper's, Billy's clothing, Wyatt's sunglasses, you see that detail. There were some scenes, such as the visit to the commune where picture quality seems a little aged compared to the rest of the film but for the most part, this is the best looking version of \\"Easy Rider\\" to date.<br /><br />As for audio, the film is presented in English, French and Portuguese Dolby TrueHD 5.1.  Also in Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital and the original English mono soundtrack.  For the most part, the film is front and center channel driven and during my first viewing, but that impressive soundtrack that this film is known for is nice and clear, dialogue is nice and clear and the revving of the motorcycles is nice and clear.  The film is dialogue and music driven and there is surround channel usage during the trippy drug-induced parts of the film when you hear voice all around you but also during that brief and tragic action sequence at the end of the film.  But the music...from hearing that bass guitar and percussion in union on \\"If 6 was 9' from The Jimi Hendrix Experience to that electric guitar and well known vocals of Steppenwolf of \\"Born to Be Wild\\" with the men on their bikes, that's classic but to hear it on DolbyTrue HD is awesome!<br /><br />Speaking of the film's soundtrack, \\"Easy Rider\\" was one of the first films to have an original score and feature popular contemporary rock songs at that time.  Included in the film are:<br /><br />  * Steppenwolf - The Pusher<br />  * Steppenwolf - Born to Be Wild<br />  * The Byrds - Wasn't Born to Follow<br />  * The Band - The Weight<br />  * The Holy Modal Rounders - If You Want to Be a Bird<br />  * Fraternity of  Man - Don't Bogart Me<br />  * The Jimi Hendrix Experience - If 6 Was 9<br />  * Electric Prunes - Kyrie Eleison<br />  * The Electric Flag - Flash, Bam, Pow<br />  * Roger McGuinn - It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)<br />  * Roger McGuinn - Ballad of Easy Rider<br /><br />As for subtitles, the subtitles are in English, English SDH, French, Portuguese and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES<br /><br />\\"Easy Rider: 40th Anniversary\\" receives Sony's special digibook packaging with a total of 36-pages and information on the music, the talent and an essay of the importance of the film and the beginning of New Hollywood.

For the most part its informative but Hopper tends to not speak for long stretches in time (I'm guessing he was engrossed in watching the film) and he's actually quite quiet.<br />  * Easy Rider, Shaking the Cage Documentary - (1:04:51) The crew and talent of \\"Easy Rider\\" give us a behind-the-scenes look at the creation of this film, how volatile things were and also dangerous.  An amazing documentary.

It's one thing to have a motorcycle road film and showcasing the allure of someone that can be seen as an outlaw but in this film, it truly is a time capsule as we are watching something that captures America during that time.  From recreating the hippie commune of New Buffalo (in New Mexico) of many hippie men and women with kids all over the place to capturing that Southern feel towards hippies and men in leather (the guys weren't gay but because of they were outside of the norm of that area, they were considered offensive) and of course, the music, the motorcycles, the drug use.  That's the late 60's.<br /><br />Also, some may view \\"Easy Rider\\" as a creative and artistic film as Hopper wanted to take advantage of creative editing styles but it would be interesting to see how his original 220 minute feature would be compared to the Henry Jaglom edited final 95 minute theatrical version.<br /><br />\\"Easy Rider\\" was also a first.  Being an independent film created less than $400,000 and making millions.  Jack Nicholson who was planning to quit from acting, was made a bonafide star thanks in part to this film and of course, ushering the new era of Hollywood and received the distinction of being in the American Film Institute's \\"Top 100 Films of All Time\\" (at #88) and Steppenwolf's \\"Born to Be Wild\\" at #29 for \\"Top 100 Songs of All Time\\".<br /><br />And of course, the behind-the-scenes making of the film and knowing how drugged out the talent were during the filming and how some improvised scenes or scenes that were not in the script, ended up in the film is quite interesting.<br /><br />If you have never owned \\"Easy Rider\\", this film deserves to be in your collection.  This is one of those rare films that manages to capture American culture at that time.  This film embodies the term \\"sex, drugs and rock n' roll\\" and once you are done with the film, \\"Easy Rider: Shaking the Cage\\", the documentary will definitely impress you.<br /><br />If you are a cinema fan, \\"Easy Rider: 40th Anniversary\\" on Blu-ray is a film that deserves to be in your collection.  Even if you owned a previous version and not much is added in terms of special featuers content, the film is worth the double dip for that awesome HD presentation and it's rockin' lossless soundtrack.

B0025X4P24|5.0|Vanessa is definately a go getter, ever present and doing her thing her way. She is always glamourous with a smooth, sentual vocal style that is not competing with anyone just delivering messages from the heart.  Like the track \\"Just Friends\\",  when you listen to the lyrics you can understand and relate to those types of real life scenarios.  She is the most accomplished MISS AMERICA to date and she has carried that title very well with style and grace, despite the controversy she made history and is still making moves creating a legacy on the screen and on the music scene.  Let's Give It Up for the DIVA.

B002KDUDG6|5.0|Overall its a good album. The music is beautiful. Yes the songs are different, but I think artists should evolve in  their work. They shouldn't veer too far away from what the audience is used to, but Buble does a good job . The album still has the easy, jazzy sounds like \\"Its Time\\" or \\"Michael Buble\\". I don't see what the problem is other than people don't like change.<br /><br />At first when I heard the album I was taken aback, but I listened a few more times and now I can't get enough of it. Buble's rendition of the classics is amazing! No one can sing them like him.<br /><br />I would recommend Crazy Love to anyone.
0441172717|5.0|As an avid reader since childhood, I've been a temporary resident of diverse worlds, but few are as memorable as Arrakis. The world Herbert created is full of opposed viewpoints, the water rich seat of government and the desolate sands or the tribal wildness of the Fremen compared to the Old World grandeur of the ruling Houses.     Herbert weaves together religion, technology, and politics among other things into an entirely original tapestry that still resonates with the real world. I first read this book as a 12 year old, and although I couldn't understand a lot of it, I was still taken in, and I've read it at least once a year since. And everytime, I notice something new, or understand something that semeed too convoluted before.     That being said, it is a book that should be read with an open mind and a avid curiousity, as there is a lot to learn about how the world works. There are some shortcomings, especially dialouge, which does end up being unwieldy at times. But Herbert also uses it to great effect at time also, managing to convey the verbal fencing the character go through in their encounters. I would also advise anyone considering reading to put aside for a moment all the tie ins and sequels and form your opinion of the franchise on the book that started it. After you read Dune, then form your opinion. I'm not particularly a fan of the movies and sequels, but many are, and they definately would be better enjoyed after reading this book first. I have, and will continue to recommend this book.
0307269752|4.0|This book is definitely an intriguing thriller.  The story pulled me in quickly and I finished the book in record time.  The cast is characters is large, but it's not too difficult to keep everyone straight if you are paying attention.  The drawback of this read was the over-the-top violence against women that starts around page 200 and does not abate until the last 50 pages or so.  I'd read that the book was once titled \\"Men Who Hate Women\\" so I expected this to some extent, but I still had to catch my breath reading the first gruesome scene.  I'll be taking a break and reading some other books before I consider the sequel.

0385504225|3.0|Like many people, I found this book to be pretty entertaining most of the way through but was disappointed by the lame ending.  Of the five Dan Brown novels, this is the forth best (better than Digital Fortress but weaker than the others).<br /><br />Brown is not a great writer (even his most ardent fans will acknowledge this I think).  The plot is formulaic, the characters are flat, & the dialogue ranges from clunky to laughable.  But, despite his shortcomings, few people can write a page-turner like Dan Brown.  Despite myself, I enjoyed The Lost Symbol (until the previously mentioned - lame ending). It is worth noting though, that even if the ending hadn't been as lame as it was, The Lost Symbol still would have fallen short of the other Langdon novels because:<br /><br />1. The lone bad guy isn't nearly as compelling a villain as the multi-pronged reach of the Catholic Church from earlier novels.<br />2. Brown seems to be trying too hard not to offend anyone this time out and it results in some awkward dialogue to ensure conventional religion, new age philosophies, and the Masons get presented in a fair and balanced manner.  He seems to be desperately trying to avoid controversy.<br />3. The science (using the term loosely) of noetics isn't really integrated effectively into the plot.  Its inclusion into the story is to provide a spring-board for characters to discuss new age philosophies, particularly during the unnecessary final 40 or so pages of the novel (aka - the lame ending) Science and religion are combined much more effectively in A&D.<br />4. It might only be me but... the European locations, art and history, and the Christianity based story-lines of Da Vinci and A&D were so much more fascinating than Washington DC and the Masons.<br />5. The big twist near the end (re the identity of the tattooed man) is so obvious it's ridiculous.  There are very few genuine surprises in this novel.<br /><br />The real let-down though is the massive disappointment of the ending.  The secrets, when revealed in the other books, paid off.  This is not the case in the Lost Symbol and this is an important factor because the previous 500 or so pages lead up to finding out what that secret is.  If it falls short, even if you found yourself enjoying the novel to that point, it leaves a bad taste in your mouth.  I won't divulge anything, but trust me - it's lame.<br /><br />The bottom line:  Brown may be a formulaic writer but he's good at what he does and he weaves some interesting historical trivia into a thriller that moves along at a relentless pace.  If you liked the previous Brown novels you'll probably find this one to be a little weaker than the others, but overall pretty entertaining - that is until you get to the end.  You will then groan in frustration and wonder whether you should have bothered reading it at all.d in the other books, paid off.

0545123267|5.0|I was attracted to this book by its cover and picked it up to see what it was about. At the book store, a lady came up to me and said, \\"You have to get that book. It's really good.\\"    When a stranger is compelled to come up to you and tell you how good a book is, I think that's generally a good sign.    At first, I thought, \\"Oh, another Twilight rip-off.\\" Yes, it has the teenage star-crossed lovers thing. It has a melancholy, misunderstood, \\"I hate the monster I am\\" hero (although much more emo and sensitive than Twilight's Edward), and a human heroine that loves him, monster parts at all. The heroine, similar to Bella, is mature beyond her years and raises herself. Her parents, who obviously love her, are quite in their own universe act more like a childless couple than one with a teenage daughter.    That's where the similarities end.    Unlike Bella, Grace is feisty from the get-go. She's not lacking self-esteem, and she doesn't mind flirting and being a little risque with her wolf/man love, Sam. In fact, she's the strong one throughout this book, saving Sam many times over (and in many different ways).     This story is intriguing, exciting, romantic, and absolutely perfect. I read it in a day and a half on a cold night -- thoroughly enjoying the story and watching Sam and Grace test the waters of their relationship. I absolutely loved how Sam was just so unsure of himself -- he showed a depth of character and a vulnerability that I found refreshing. Too often, we see heroes who are self-loathing, but perfect in every other way. Sam is an excellent study of contradictions, and I thought Maggie Stiefvater did a great job in crafting him and the story.    I am just sad that it seems as though this is a one-book thing -- not a saga. I would love to read more about Sam and Grace. I think there's still a lot of story to tell.
0882709194|1.0|From  Dr. Eugenie Scott's review:<br /><br />  \\" Unfortunately, it will be hard to thoroughly read the version that Comfort will be distributing on college campuses in November. The copy his publisher sent me is missing no fewer than four crucial chapters, as well as Darwin's introduction. Two of the omitted chapters, Chapters 11 and 12, showcase biogeography, some of Darwin's strongest evidence for evolution. Which is a better explanation for the distribution of plants and animals around the planet: common ancestry or special creation? Which better explains why island species are more similar to species on the mainland closest to them, rather than to more distant species that share a similar environment? The answer clearly is common ancestry. Today, scientists continue to develop the science of biogeography, confirming, refining, and extending Darwin's conclusions.<br /><br />  Likewise missing from Comfort's bowdlerized version of the Origin is Chapter 13, where Darwin explained how evolution makes sense of classification, morphology, and embryology. To take a simple example, why do all land vertebrates (amphibians, mammals, and reptiles and birds) have four limbs? Not because four limbs are necessarily a superior design for land locomotion: insects have six, arachnids have eight, and millipedes have, well, lots. It's because all land vertebrates descended with modification from a four-legged (\\"tetrapod\\") ancestor. Since Darwin's era, scientists have repeatedly confirmed that the more recently two species have shared a common ancestor, the more similar are their anatomy, their biochemistry, their embryology, and their genetics.\\"
B000ZECQ08|2.0|I have read all the books and seen all the movies to date and I must say I was so disappointed by this movie. My husband, who has not read the books, but seen all the movies, was completely lost in this movie. I had to keep explaining parts to him that were in the book but not in the movie. Or explaining parts that were briefly touched on in the movie, but not explained well enough to make sense to someone who hasn't read the books. They screen writers have really fallen off the wagon in the translation of this book to screen. There were so many things in the movie that needed fleshing out and instead of doing that; the writers threw in scenes in the movie that weren't in the book. I truly hope for the sake of the last two movies that the director reads these reviews and realizes that he needs to find writers who will stay true to the books.<br /><br />On a separate note, the acting in the movie was excellent. These kids have come quite a long ways in their careers and you can tell. I just watched the HP movies 1 & 2 the other day and it is impressive to see the improvement.<br /><br />I can only hope for better things in the next two installments. I am seriously considering not adding the last movies to my collection if they continue to go downhill as they have. :(
0385504225|2.0|I only read the Lost Symbol because I liked DaVinci Code.  It was as if Brown knew he could not top D.C. but he wanted to keep writing.  Lost Symbol has none of the flavor of D.C. It was as if Brown had paid a ghostwriter.  I was very disappointed to say the least.  I will not be reading his next book even if the movie, Lost Symbol, turns out to be as good as D.C.  A movie only asks me to invest 90 or so minutes.  The book took too many hours from my life that I can't get back.
B00079FUI6|5.0|I started watching this with misgivings.  I thought it was going to be another pointless melodrama, or not unlike dozens of comedy shows that I've seen part of and dismissed as nonsense.  There is no laugh track so that dim bulbs will know what's supposed to be funny.  It did take a few episodes, I will admit, but I was eventually hooked.    The main women have impossible problems in an idyllic appearing neighborhood of a city that is never named.  Car license plates bear the name of a state that doesn't exist.  The picket fences are perfectly white.  The lawns are immaculately trimmed, without a dandelion, but it never rains or even gets cloudy.  And into this seemingly perfect world comes a ton of trouble.  First a suicide.  Then a mysterious handsome stranger who sets at least two female hearts aflutter.  A house gets torched around a measuring cup.  There are wild brats from hell.  A high school boy finds himself wooed and bedded by an unbelievably sexy woman.  There's a murder and a remote burial in the night.  And all of that is just for starters.    It sounds really bad when described that way, but it is all larded with satire and farcical scenes.  Much of it revolves around skewed value systems of the characters.  They value painfully green lawns.  Fancy cars.  Perfect dinner parties.  And they are constantly flopping on their faces, despite all their efforts.     The characters are varied--a much too perfect housewife, a horny divorcee, a blond seductress, a harried mother, and that very sexy statutory rapist.  The plot is convoluted, all tied somehow to the woman who commits suicide as the first episode opened.  Try as they might, her female friends cannot figure out why.    I did laugh a bunch, and I did look forward to the next episode.  But this is not for viewers who insist on stark reality and taking this show at face value.  Farce is not, after all, reality, just part of reality.
0385504225|4.0|I admit my husband and I had a hard time getting through the first two chapters: another dead body part in the midst of another revered location.  But as we read further we both got hooked.  Brown seems to link the characters and the plot together a little better than in his first two books. It's also a great way to learn a little bit about Wahington DC, especially if you haven't been there. We read the book with our lap tops by our sides, looking up photos of the various buildings, monuments, art work and sculptures mentioned in the book as we went.  The Lost Symbol is a great 'faction' read and as good as any other source of mindless entertainment.
0071636080|5.0|Too bad I bought the Kindle version. I love writing in margins and highlighting in yellow.<br /><br />I'm not just reading this book; I'm devouring it. I'm condensing it to use in my work, especially my writing, but also in my presentations. In fact, I'm going to use this stuff in debates at the conference table during a meeting and blow away the people who torment me. They're doomed to humiliation. Toast, I tell you.<br /><br />The content:<br /><br />Create stories. Intro the villain. Talk in threes.<br /><br />Send in the hero to solve the problem and banish the villain. Above all, always remember (and don't ever forget) people don't care about you, your product, your needs . . . as much as they care about themselves. So don't bore them about you, your mission, your data.<br /><br />So. Give people personal reasons to read your writing, to listen to your presentation, to buy your product. Let them know why they should care. Make them fear to be left out of your influence. Remember, it's all about them.<br /><br />All this, and I'm only a third way through the book. Forget about Steven Jobs and computers and PowerPoint. This book transcends all those things to get to the elegant simplicity in how to reach out and recruit people to your side. Already, I've hit upon the secret to why writing works, why it sells and why no writing book I know of has ever attacked the problem from Carmine Gallo's POV. So I'm writing about it (elsewhere). It's not about the writer, not about the written or spoken product, even. It's about the reader, the listener, the customer, the you you should care about recruiting.<br /><br />More than care, I love, love, love the useful insights of this book. I got a book of my own out of this book that's so powerful because it takes its own advice.<br /><br />Oh, and I almost forgot. Be passionate.<br /><br />PS: I'm not Carmine's uncle or anything. I don't know him, can't vouch for him (to borrow a line from Fargo). Not a shill here, just a guy who hasn't run across a book this useful in a long time.

B002P7UCMC|5.0|As much as I liked Reise Reise and Rosenrot, I never thought they really could do much better than Mutter.<br /><br />However, with Liebe Ist Fur Alle Da, Rammstein has proven they are still a force to be reckoned with. This album, while not better than Mutter (in my opinion), is the best thing they have done in almost 10 years. This album is heavy and experimental. The ballads are top notch, and come close to the beauty of Ohne Dich. There is also a lot more synth, horns, and strings than ever before. Till Lindemann's growl on this record is harsh and inhuman and perfectly compliments the heavier tracks on the album. All, this and a killer album cover (the dinner table scene, not the deluxe cover).<br /><br />The only bad song is (not surprisingly) the Pussy track. Great video, but I cannot stomach this song.<br /><br />So get ready for a bombastic, cinematic, crushing experience. Rammstein fans will be pleased.
0060935464|5.0|I won't analyze this book fully. But simply put, this book was VERY easy to keep reading and it wasn't a chore to pick it up and finish a chapter.              This book also gets some moral lessons across, while not being too preachy, like other \\"Literary Classics.\\" A.K.A. garbage I was assigned to read that was just as exciting as reading a phone book or dictionary, that had stupid \\"adults\\" with too many obvious problems and major personality flaws and they were too dumb to see and fix them, and some really stupid, pessimistic, angst-filled, moral lesson that only artsy, emo, over-intellectual, passive aggressive people could even apply to their lives. Everyone else with a balanced psyche would roll their eyes at these \\"lessons.\\" \\"Lord of the Flies\\" comes to mind with the moral of \\"The kids are okay, but who will save the adults?\\" Lame. You can't control everything in life as an adult, but you can control most of it. Most of life is what you make of it. Get over it and stop being melodramatic.               You know who you are if the type of \\"Reading\\" material above gives you a headache. If you are, stick with \\"To Kill a Mockingbird.\\" It's a good read overall.
B000ZNRBK4|5.0|I knew that this lens hood woulden't help a whole lot on lens flare/glare, But I have been in spots where the sun is just glaring right on you and it can affect the photos, and the lens hood helped a lot.<br /><br />I also got it for the looks too, it my D60 looks really nice with the 18-55VR + HB-45 lens hood.  I like it a lot, theres not much that I can say about it because it's just a lens hood.<br /><br />The only complaint that I have is, the price.  It is a little expensive, but I mean come on people it's only 17 dollars. it's not that big of a deal.<br /><br />Anyways, I love the lens hood.  Just remember when you use your built in flash at wide angle, to take off the hood or put it on reverse.  The SB600 will fix that so you don't have to take off the lens hood, which will be my next purchase.<br /><br />I highly recommend this hood if you have the 18-55 lens.
B002SJIO4A|5.0|District 9 is something that perhaps no one saw coming, and ends up being the absolute best movie of the summer hands down. Produced by Peter Jackson and helmed by Neill Blomkamp (the director Jackson hand picked for the shelved Halo movie), District 9 depicts an alien race that came to Earth on an emergency basis a couple decades before hand, and have since become refugees in a violent slum in Johannesburg. Bureaucrat Wikus (Sharlto Copley) is charged with serving eviction notices to the alien \\"prawns\\", and through a mishap, ends up undergoing a horrifying transformation that makes him a wanted man by everyone. As he and a prawn dubbed Christopher Johnson become unlikely allies, things begin to really kick into high gear. Beginning as part mockumentary and part satire on apartheid, District 9 takes its time to become a bloody full-blown action/sci-fi opus that stays with you long after the credits are done rolling. What also helps make District 9 so good is that you truly never know what is going to happen next. The sheer unpredictability of the film helps make it so magnetic, and newcomer Copley manages to be hateable, likable, and sympathetic all at the same time as his character continues to develop and change (literally) as the film goes on. All in all, District 9 is an incredible science fiction film that features equal parts action and heart, and in a bloated summer full of empty blockbusters like Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, G.I. Joe, and the like; it is indeed refreshing to see something like this on the big screen. Do yourself a favor, don't miss out on District 9.
076532413X|2.0|I really, really wanted to enjoy this book.  The central concept of this book - the Flashforward where all of humanity had a brief glimpse of the future - has fascinating and wide-ranging implications which could have been the core of an excellent novel.  However, I felt like the book was poorly written.  A number of issues come to mind:<br /><br />1) Shallow and unbelievable characters:<br />  - I found myself laughing at the description of a 7 year-old boy's reaction to his Flashforward.  I couldn't envision my son reacting in the same way.<br />  - I also laughed when the protagonist was able to silence a pack of pool reporters by threatening to cut an interview short, as if the reporters were simply trained dogs which can be made to obey on command...<br /><br />2) Inconsistent pacing<br />  - The story has the audacity to predict the entire future of the human race within the last chapter.  A bit jarring after the pace of the first 95% of the book.<br /><br />3) Fiction over science<br />  - The science in this story was simply to provide a plot device.  Wherever needed, technobabble was deployed to advance the plot - not a fault in and of itself - but I never got the sense that the technobabble was internally consistent.  Basically, just make something up (plausible or not) any time an explanation was needed.  Later on, if another explanation was needed, just make up something entirely new, not necessarily related to established conventions.<br /><br />This being my first read of a Sawyer book - can anyone tell me if all his material suffers from poor execution?  Many of his other books have fascinating concepts, but I'm not sure if I can take another read like this.  In a perfect world, I wish he would hire another writer to tend to the details and just provide plot outlines and guidance.<br /><br />Oh well.  I've heard the TV show is better than the book (a rare occurrence, but seems plausible to me after reading the book), so maybe I'll check that out next.

B00005JLD4|1.0|First, let me start by writing that I did order this movie back in December of 2008. I actually ordered 2. I sent one to my sister and one was for myself. My sister enjoyed the movie which I knew she would however, I did not open my DVD package right away. Since I had already seen the movie and enjoyed it so much I wanted to have one in my collection. Fast forward to September 26, 2009: \\"Girls' Night Out\\" at my house which was \\"movie night\\" and I open the Rabbit Proof Fence DVD and yes, there was a DVD in there just not the one I ordered.     I did not look at the DVD disk as I was putting it into the DVD player. Imagine my surprise when the previews were for Chinese Martial Arts films. I skipped to the movie which also was a Chines Maritial Arts film. I was embrassed and disappointed that the movie I thought was suppose to be in the DVD package was not. I had shared with my friends what a great movie, Rabbit Prood Fence is and then did not have it to view.     No bad reviews for the movie just Amazon's and the movie distributer's service. Since this happened after I had placed my last order with Amazon right now I am now so sure I will order from Amazon again. Since it was ten months ago that I had ordered the DVD I don't have the receipt so I did not return it. I gave the Marital Arts DVD to my husband who already has it. Bummer!
B000001ZS4|5.0|I first purchased this album over 25 years ago.  I really liked it then and even more now.  Over the past 25 years I have purchased hundreds of new age albums by Eno, Budd, Oldfield, Guthrie and so many more.  The electronic sound of Equinoxe was innovative when it was first released, and I liked the upbeat styling of it.  I've listened to so much droning new age music over the years that it is refreshing to put this vibrant CD into the mix.
B00005N5S2|3.0|The movie - MacArthur was ok, but I thought Patton was better. I think MacArthur was really full of himself and he had an ego, as big as all outdoors. This movie was a bit vague about some things like MacArthur getting fired by Truman during the Korean War and what happened afterwards.
B0029LHW4U|4.0|To be honest I did not intend to buy this album.  The idea of trying to find a singer to fill Layne Staley's place seemed ridiculous to me.  I am thrilled to say the band did not try to replace Staley.  Instead they found a solid singer, who like Staley, can hit the high notes and harmonize beautifully with Cantrell.  This next part may be blasphemous but I believe Duvall's voice is much smoother than Staley's ever was.  This is not meant as an insult but listening to Layne, even during the quieter songs, was like having my soul cut into by a serated scalpel.  That was just one of the things that made his vocals so good.      The music itself is just as good as ever.  They pretty much throw the kitchen sink into this one.  Everything that made AIC's other albums great is here:  acoustic guitar, heavy riffs, non-guitar strings, piano, and the hamonizing of two great singers.  While it's true Cantrell takes the lion share of the singing duties this is not a bad thing.  His voice is as good as ever.  Also I think it would have been a bad move pushing DuVall to the forefront of every song.  There is already enough pressure on this guy without giving fans the impression that he is being forced on them.    Long story short, this is a solid album and it represents a progression for the band while staying true to what has made them great.  Anyone on the fence about \\"that new singer\\" should get over it and check out this album.  I don't think many people will come away disappointed.
B000ZECQ08|5.0|Look here's the thing.    Movie and literature are just two completely different mediums. It's hard when you want something to be so faithful to a book without thinking of the big picture that in truth everything doesn't adapt well to the screen. I thought this was the best Harry Potter film effort yet, and those complaining about the ending while I agree it was severely changed I'm sure it's to heighten the suspense for all of the action that is consistant throughout the last book. This film deserves to stand alone as a great film. Not only have all of the students matured acting wise tremendously, but Michael Gambon pulls off really a note-worthy performance and never have I laughed so many times in a Harry Potter film. It paced, and it's best that has come this way.

We will definately buy them again.
B002KDUDG6|4.0|I was first introduced to Michael Buble's music with his Call Me Irresistible album and tv specials and have been captivated by the uniqueness of his voice ever since.  His voice is absolutely refreshing as are the remakes with his fresh interpretations of the classics.  No doubt that Michael Buble is very talented.  As with all CDs, I usually have to play it a few times to get a real feel...upon first listening, you are exposed to a variety of sounds (in fact the first sounds like the beginning of a James bond movie) discovering the diversity of Buble's skills.  I have to say that my favorite is his toe-tapping tune of Haven't Met You Yet.  I definitely recommend getting this CD, and again, play it a few times and watch how it continues to grow on you!

The translation also has a kind of poetry that I suspect is close to the German, however there are a fair number grammatical errors or typos in this edition - it seems they used spell check so the typos aren't obvious, but I can't go more than a few paragraphs without having to read a sentence a few times to figure out which word was left out or spell-checked into the wrong word.  'Learned' becomes 'Leaned', 'that' becomes 'That', 'ice' becomes 'icy', 'breaths' becomes 'breathes', commas break sentences in ways that unintentionally change meaning, etc... These are just some examples from a few pages chosen at random.  This problem is consistent throughout the book.  There is even an instance where a question left by the translator, in German, is sitting IN THE TEXT in a sentence, which is just absurd.
B002S0OBFK|1.0|I have not gone to a theatre to see a movie in a very long time...years, until I started seeing the trailers for this movie. They unfortunately are very short and specific ones that only show the \\"static\\" camera scenes in the bedroom! This is so misleading. If I had known that the movie was in \\"first person\\" mode complete with the \\"shakey camera\\" to let you know that it is being held by someone who is a complete moron I would not have spent a dime on it. 5 minutes into this film I and my wife were ready to vomit from motion sickness. We did not walk out and demand our money back because we kept waiting , and only opening our eyes when the camera was in the bedroom on the tripod, for something/anything to happen. What a disappointment. I love horror movies that scare the s... out of me, I live for them, they are my very favorites, but this one? Take our advice and wait for your neighbor to lay out the money for this when it comes out on DVD in a couple of months and borrow it from them so when you finish it, if you do, you can merely hand it back to them and say to yourself \\"thank god I didnt buy that one!\\" Four thumbs down for this one, dont waste your time or money.

B001V9LPWQ|5.0|It's getting more and more difficult for Blu-Ray resisters to resist getting Blu-Ray, now that The Wizard of Oz and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs are available in crystalline clarity. The new Snow White Diamond Edition has so much new material, that when you combine it with the previous Platinum Edition (which still has some features not included on the new release), it can almost be thought of as \\"The Art of Snow White, Volumes 1 and 2.\\"<br /><br />In addition to the picture quality, the new Blu-Ray offers an interactive Magic Mirror feature, an immersive visit to Disney's Hyperion Studio, where Walt and his staff worked until Snow White's huge success made the Burbank location affordable.<br /><br />But my favorite, and if you've read my earlier reviews you know where I'm going with this, is the audio commentary. Animation historian John Canemaker, who wrote the excellent Making of the Animated Raggedy Ann & Andy book among other important works, provides a diamond mine of information -- with none other than Walt Disney himself providing his own comments through interviews.<br /><br />It's one thing to read about Walt and Roy Disney getting feature film negotiation advice from Charlie Chaplin, it's downright amazing to hear him explain it in his own words. You can even hear Walt admit that he actually hated Snow White for a while because he wearied of living in its shadow and having every subsequent project compared to it. That's the sort of frustration you may not have thought about in hindsight, since Walt did so much since, but it underscores the importance of this film -- perhaps the one project that made everything after it possible.<br /><br />There are two Blu-Ray discs included, loaded with the features, plus a standard DVD of the feature as well. The commentary appears on both formats. If you're on the fence about Blu-Ray, this is a chance to compare the two and decide. If you'd prefer the whole thing in DVD, it is apparently going to be released on November 24, but of course without the interactive technologies only possible on the new format.the interactive technologies only possible on the new format.

0307269981|5.0|How do you top a book that was excellently plotted, filled with memorable characters and an intriguing mystery?  Apparently, by changing up the formula, filling out the already great characters with even more character and spinning a mystery that's more devilish, more immediate and more character-driven than before.  In The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Stieg Larsson created an excellent book that marked the beginning of a great author whose life was cut tragically short.  The Girl Who Played with Fire cements his status as a premiere thriller writer.  For those who haven't read the first book, beware because this review will obviously discuss the first book.<br /><br />At the end of Tattoo, our two characters Blomkvist and Salander have had a falling out and haven't spoken to each other.  Meanwhile, Bjurman, the evil sadist who was a minor yet insidious character in Tattoo, is still fuming over Salander's way of getting back at him by branding him as the sadist he is and holding onto a tape documenting his evilness.  The Girl Who Played with Fire starts out with a few different story strands like Tattoo.  Also, like Tattoo these apparently divergent stories end up colliding in shocking ways.  You have Salander's mysterious story, Bjurman's attempt to get rid of Salander on one hand.  On the other, there's the Millennium paper side of things that is going to publish a book on sex trafficing that will expose a variety of members in Swedish culture as being a part of it.  The stories converge in a shocking sequence of violence that propels the rest of the story forward.<br /><br />Unlike Tattoo, The Girl Who Played with Fire's story is much more immediate and character driven.  It delves more into Salander's character and answers many questions fans will have had when they finished the first book.  It's also much better paced and written.  One of the complaints I had about the first novel was that a lot of paragraphs had poor transitions into each other, making some sections feel more like vignettes than an interconnected story.  Fire plays out much better and the transitions were much smoother.  One area that tended to break my connection to the story were sometimes stupid characters.  At times, characters do thinks that seem to be more for the sake of moving the plot forward than for anything realistic.  Sometimes obvious clues are missed and other times the characters (particularly the police) seem completely ill suited for their jobs.  That said, character development for Salander is front and center, this time, and her story is one with quite a few little twists and turns.  Unlike Tattoo, where I figured out the central mystery pretty quickly into it, Fire surprised me multiple times in the direction it took.  My recommendation is to know as little about the story as possible and just let it take you along its tumultuous journey.<br /><br />I was really surprised with The Girl Who Played with Fire.  It upped the ante in terms of storytelling and pacing and presented some shocking situations that really sold me on Larsson's ability as an author.  I also really enjoyed Larsson's framing of the story as an algebraic equation.  Much like his use of statistics for the previous novel, Larsson uses an algebraic equation to introduce the sections and while it's not as obvious a connection as the stats, it becomes an ingenious framing device that sells the ending.  Like Tattoo, The Girl Who Played with Fire deals, once again, with Men Who Hate Women (as the Swedish original title indicates), but it tackles it in a larger purview.  An excellent read and a startling critique on Swedish society, it is a powerful thriller and one I'd recommend without a single reservation.like vignettes than an interconnected story.

B002NXSRX4|5.0|The original series (yes I am that old) was a big toy commercial, and it was always about the vehicles and a big battle at the end.<br />When I first saw the trailer I said \\"WOW that looks awesome!\\" and when I saw it in the theater I was totally pumped the whole time. People who complain about the acting or the CGI are seriously deranged. Its a movie based on a glorified series of toy commercials...gimme a break. I thought everything was perfect, especially Snake Eyes. His entrance scene was spectacular. The power suits were cool, and weren't over used. There was lots of cool vehicles, and all of the characters were developed and brought to life. I admit that it should have been obvious, but I was surprised by the ending.<br /><br />This is what Transformers should/could have been if someone at some point had realized that giving it to a director with no talent might lead to a piece of gutter garbage.

He also randomly plugs for all kinds of consumer technology like Apple computers (going down to the model and features) which I thought was really weird.<br /><br />If you want to read a great page-turner with fascinating characters and an awesome plot, check out The Opportunists by Yohann de Silva.

Dan and Chip Heath explore the reasons of why some ideas catch the attention of an audience while others seem to just fall by the waste side.  The authors use both historical examples and social sciences to study the phenomenon of Stickness that was introduced in 2000 by Malcolm Gladwell in his book entitled The Tipping Point.    Stickness is the reason why an idea stands high above the rest.      Looking at the title of the book and the table on contents, one could easily make the assumption that this book is targeting future marketers, which is further from the truth.    This book is a quick read with contents that can be understood by a variety of consumers.  The guidelines within this book can easily be used across numerous occupation and even life in general.  As noted in many reviews, some have even considered the ideas, life changing.   This reviewer highly recommends this book for all audiences.  This book is a great companion to The Tipping Point.      From a military point of view, getting an idea to \\"stick\\" is a very difficult leadership issue.

B002K0WBYG|3.0|This is one of those indecisive reviews.  I like Ryan Reynolds and Sandra Bullock but the two just don't seem to mesh like say a...Kate Hudson/Matthew McConaha(SpellCheck) movie.  I liked the plot and the movie had some really scenic moments when the BLU-RAY showed off but it just seemed like something was missing.  Reynolds is his usual funny self but I find it hard to laugh at Sandra Bullock sometimes... she's just too serious an actress.    I will probably watch again sometime cause I just don't know.  I can't remember any really great parts, and that in itself is not a good thing... I am glad I bought it, it was entertaining so overall it wasn't a waste of money.  Just not a great comedy...

B000U1ZV3U|4.0|The rating you will give this movie will depend almost solely on your like of Kevin Costner and the Wyatt Earp (Cowboy) saga.  I give it 4 stars because I'm a Costner fan and I love the Earp Cowboy story.  I just can't give a good Cowboy tale less than four starts.  I would give City Slickers 4 starts, cause I love Billy Crystal...  Now, is this movie anywhere as good as Tombstone... I say no way...  Yes it does go way more indepth into who Wyatt Earp is and where he came from but Kevin Costner is just not good enough to overpower the great supporting cast in \\"Tombstone\\"   I think Costner is a way better actor, therefore, he gets the nod over Kurt Russell in Tombstone, but Val Kilmer is what puts Tombstone over the top... His role in Tombstone is classic and leagues better than Dennis Quad in the Wyatt Earp film.      From a Blu-Ray perspective it really all depends on how much you are paying attention.  Is it as explosive and as ALIVE as a BLU-RAY cartoon movie or GLADIATOR... NO. But, is it horrible, NO.  It's an improvement on the standard DVD and that is what your paying for so I have no complaints.  Would I buy this movie on BLU-RAY if I already have Wyatt Earp on Standard DVD... No... But I can say that for any movie I have already...

Simply put, the novel includes several diagrams and reproductions of handwritten notes -which are not included in this Kindle edition. So, you pretty much have to get a copy of the physical book, or do without important clues to the solution of the mystery. I have read other Kindle books which include diagrams, drawings, etc., so it can easily be done. This particular publisher/editor didn't bother, and the result is a less-than-satisfactory reading experience. Five stars for the novel; 1 star for the Kindle edition.

B001QTXM5Y|4.0|How you feel about this film is largely dependent on how you feel about the original Watchmen graphic novel. If you have not read the novel or couldn't get into it, then you are likely to find the movie to be baffling and boring. The Watchmen story is, among other things, a complex dissection of the often fascist cultural impulses behind the very concept of superheroes rather than the superhero-based action adventure that many people expected when they went to the theaters. It's a talky, introspective, pessimistic story - not at all a good candidate for a summer blockbuster, as the studio tried to portray it. During my original viewing, a number of people walked out of the theatre. Some, no doubt, were turned off by the story's politics, but most simply weren't getting what they expected from a superhero movie.  Compounding the difficulty of the story's content is its structure. Originally released as a series of separate comic books that were later combined to form the graphic novel, the Watchmen story is episodic with far too many protagonists for a feature film to manage. For years the novel was considered un-filmable by would-be producers and directors. Ideally, the best film adaption for Watchmen would be as a mini-series that enables the nuances of each episode to be fully realized and that didn't require viewers to digest such a sprawling tale in a single sitting. Feature films, however, are where the money is at and after his success with the comic-based, 300, Zack Snyder was hired to give it a try. That he's succeeded as well as he has is impressive. That he made a less than perfect movie was pre-ordained by the nature of the source material.  The principle flaw with Snyder's Watchmen film is that it takes a really long time to get to the main action of the plot. In this three hour movie, the first two hours are spent establishing the numerous characters and setting up the background for the story. For people like me who worship the novel and are fascinatedby the world and characters of Watchmen, this is engaging. For the casual movie-goer, though, it's boring. The only way for Snyder to have avoided this flaw and paced the story better would have been to streamline the plot, reducing or eliminating several of the characters. That this didn't happen is actually surprising since butchering great novels to make formulaic features is, after all, the main business of Hollywood. Many critics who complained about the film's &#34;excessive&#34; loyalty to the novel supposedly would have preferred such a streamlined version. And yet I wonder if they would have then complained about the changes made to the original story. A cut-down version of the Watchmen story might have resulted in a more commercially successful movie, but then it would not have been Watchmen. I'm glad that Snyder stayed loyal to the novel, even if this does result in an imperfect film. Movies get judged too much these days by how much money they make. Watchmen did not become the blockbuster that supposedly all superhero movies must become, but it is the best possible feature film version of Watchmen and wonderfully translates the classic novel to the screen. For fans of the novel, like me, it's a wonderful film.

B001V9LPWQ|5.0|What can one say about Snow White and the Seven Dwarves? This movie is the definition of classic, and most people already know if they like the movie or not.  For that reason, I won't get too much into the actual movie other than to say that after having watched this disc again, my preconceptions of the movie have changed over the years.  What was once simple and unappealing has taken on a deeper and more nuanced meaning. For those that haven't seen this movie since their childhood, I would recommend revisiting it to see if your opinion has changed.  Mine certainly has.<br /><br />Now to this actual package and the burning question for most:  Should I upgrade?<br /><br />First, picture quality.  As per all of the recent Disney Blu-rays, picture and sound quality are absolutely top notch.  Comparing this disc to the previous 2-disc platinum DVD, it can be seen that picture quality has indeed been improved.  Colors are rich and vibrant and some scenes look as if they were painted on the screen.  Stunning.  This is somewhat suprising considering the previous set was no slouch.  Leaving no stone unturned, hi-def mono is included for purists along with hi-def 7.1 audio.<br /><br />As to the set as a whole.  Wow!  Disney sure knows how to put a package together and this set seems to have it all.  Included for a limited time is a DVD version of the movie, nice for families that have DVD players in other rooms or need one for a travel player.  (and another reason why this set might make your old platinum set obsolete.)  Note though that a Digital Copy is not included.<br /><br />Comparing the extras.  Again, wow.  the Hyperion Studios tour on the second disc is almost worth the price of admission alone.  It is separated into sections representing the various departments within the studio.  Each section is displayed as a high def capture of an old black and white photo taken of that department in the studio.  And as old as the photos are, they absolutely pop off the screen.  Info is presented as narrated bits of old footage and sound clips to explain what went on in this area of the studio.<br /><br />Also included in each section are old Disney cartoons, like the Silly Symphonies \\"Music Land\\" and Mickey Mouse \\"Steamboat Willie\\" and \\"Playful Pluto\\".  Classics all and a real treat.  Note that some of these are on the Platinum set but more are on offer here.<br /><br />My only real gripe with the Hyperion studios tour is that it is laid out in a very confusing manner and is easy to get lost in.  That is unless you know to press down on your remote to bring up the index, which handily shows you which clips you've already watched.<br /><br />So in summation, this disc is highly recommended.  For the movie, the image quality, and the extras.  It is worthy upgrade for Disney fans appreciative of the wealth of extras and for anyone looking for the best representation of an animation milestone.its of old footage and sound clips to explain what went on in this area of the studio.

B0029O08WA|1.0|I don't comment on item unless I have extreme disapproval. This soundtrack really sucks. It's a total waste of money. Other reviews say keep listening to it, you'll grow to like it. Really I have honestly tried, I listen to it all the time in my car, at home, while I'm reading and it still is annoying suicidal music. I know that the book is depressing and that Bella is depressed during the book, but she does have moments of gravity and warmth when she's with Jake, which is not conveyed on to this album. If this is a prelude to how the movie is going to be I have to say I am a little scared.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Let's not kid ourselves here.  The original PS3 SIXAXIS Controller felt too light to be taken seriously.  It felt like you were holding a cheaply made third party knockoff.  The added weight of the vibration in the Dual Shock 3 really gives the controller a nice heft to it.  It just feels so much more solid.  It's hard to describe but trust me you won't want to go back.  The addition of vibration is welcome but the added weight is where this really paid off for me.

But just in case, let me make it clear that I'm refering to the version with the pitiful 50 page forward by Ray 'banana man' Comfort.  That's RAY COMFORT ! He's one of those awful creationists who try every low-down trick in the book in order to sneak their ignorant brand of nonsense under the noses of any unsuspecting individual.   Even if Comfort wound up putting his name to a brand of toilet paper, You'd be wise to think twice before wiping your arse on it; You may just end up feeling dirtier than before you started.   If Ray Comfort wishes to believe in the claptrap of creationism that's up to him.  But he should write his own book about it, instead of riding on the coat tails of a genius who changed the way humanity views itself by showing us how we really got here.
B001OQCV3I|2.0|Quentin Tarantino is a great filmmaker.  Just ask him.<br /><br />And he calls this movie his \\"masterpiece.\\"  \\"Some of my best writing ever.\\"  The accolades were pouring in...from Quentin.<br /><br />But it's been a while since I've enjoyed any of his films.  The last time I remember liking anything he did was JACKIE BROWN.  He had an incredible cast and that film showed a new maturity in him.  Everything since has been his worst indulgences.  The KILL BILL movies were all over the place.  DEATH PROOF was worse than any of the drive-in chase movies that ripped up the screens in the 70s.<br /><br />So now we have INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS.  Is it possible that Quentin is trying to make his misspellings a part of his schtick to diffuse Jane Hamsher's book where she reprints a handwritten note from Quentin complimenting her beautiful \\"leggs\\"?  Or does the guy really just not know how to use spell check?  That's not a slam: I'm genuinely curious.<br /><br />As interesting and stylistically well done as this movie is, it still doesn't help the viewer navigate its story.  Was anyone squeamish about seeing American soldiers brutalizing Nazis and even scalping them with stomach-churning sound effects?  With our soldiers in two war fronts in the world right now, do we really need this characterization as entertainment playing throughout the world?

0882709194|1.0|This review refers to the abridged printing with introduction by Ray Comfort. This edition is in my view an unethical, dishonest creationist propaganda piece. Comfort is distributing the book free through Christian organizations and schools that have a creationist agenda. Please don't be misled into thinking that this is the real deal, i.e., an unabridged edition of Darwin's great work.     If this review appears in conjunction with any other edition of Darwin's On the Origin of Species, it is Amazon's error, not mine.

7884038137|5.0|This David O. Selznick film is a remake of an earlier film with the same name. Ingrid also played in this one so it is easy to get them mixed-up at first.<br /><br />The story is a classic and has been told in many ways. A famous violinist (Leslie Howard) falls in love with his daughter's piano teacher (Ingrid Bergman). Unlike many movies where the couple cause each other trouble and force the other one to beg his/her way back into good graces, the situations are real enough that you feel that you are part of the story. You will have to watch to find out how they deal with feelings and act on them.<br /><br />You can easily get wrapped up in the story and forget that there is quit a bit of beautiful music in this film.<br /><br />If you find this movie as intriguing as I do, your next story should be \\"Brief Encounter\\" - Criterion Collection (1945). See my review \\"When you feel like British, no other film will do as well.\\" May 6, 2001<br /><br />[[ASIN:0780023420 Brief Encounter - Criterion Collection]]

0307269981|5.0|My first recommendation to people who've read [[ASIN:0307454541 The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]] and would like to read this book is DON'T READ THE BLURB ON THE BACK OF THE BOOK. It gives too much away! Thankfully, I didn't until I was already deep into this stunningly entertaining novel. This review will contain no spoilers!<br /><br />Although I enjoyed [[ASIN:0307454541 The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]] immensely, I found it very slow in the beginning. My other criticism of it was that its ending was anticlimactic: the REAL ending of the book took place about 4/5 of the way through, when serial killer was identified. This book does not suffer from these flaws -- it is exciting right from the get-go and intense for all 514 pages. Also, Salander -- rather than Blomkvist -- is the star of this book, and I think she's a much more interesting character, so that's a plus.<br /><br />On the downside, the mystery is not nearly as deep as the one in [[ASIN:0307454541 The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]]. In fact, this is more of an action novel than a \\"mystery\\" thriller. Nevertheless, I enjoyed this book like few others I've read recently, and give it five stars without reservation.
0385504225|3.0|Before I wrote this review, I looked at the spread of the star ratings over 1200+ reviews written.  Pretty evenly divided amongst all 5 possible ratings.  And that sums up the book.      I gave it a 3 star rating because it's neither terribly good nor terribly bad.  To me, the story didn't move along quick enough and didn't make me want to keep reading.  There was also one 'jump the shark' moment that upset me so much, I put the book down and didn't pick it up again for three days.   Lastly, I think Brown rushed this to print.  It seems to me that he had 75% of the plot ready and then made the last 25% up on the fly.  (Sorry didn't work for me).    But if you enjoyed Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons, you will enjoy this book.
0882709194|1.0|Please buy another version of this great book. I'm insulted that Amazon would even offer this version. As usual, Mr. Comfort's deceitful ways will backfire on him though. He continues to prove that people like him will use any underhanded tactic they can dream up to further their own agenda.

B001NEK2GE|3.0|I received this item through Amazon's vine program.  At first I was very excited to hook it up and play some World of Warcraft using it to tailor all of my buttons and keep everything nice and streamlined.<br /><br />It is a really great concept, and if I could just break out of my habits, it would have been a very welcome edition to my gaming table.  The buttons are very ergonomical and comfortabel to rest my hand on, but the mere thought of playing my game a different way was too much to handle and I was unable to use this for very long.<br /><br />The screen on top does a nice job of displying some minimal stats, but with everything displayed on the gaming screen, it was unnecessary and rarely caught a glimpse from me.<br /><br />If I had to rate the product itself, and I do...I would gladly state that this keyboard edition is a good piece of equipment and would be perfect for someone who could tailor their gameplay to conform to it.
B000VPUIA6|3.0|I love The Beatles. I really do. But to end up paying about 150 including shipping for this box sex is a little insane. It's a fantastic box set, and worth a decent amount of money. But Amazon, you should lower your price so the lesser financially able Beatles fans such as myself dont have to go out of their way to buy this like I did.
0143038419|2.0|a very advertised and highly recommented by different people....to my opinion though,it is certainly a lot less than expected, and very ''posed'', too.The writer tries to make her point.the fact is that, neither her language, hor her writing talents, prove enough for the issues talked about in the book.
0385613857|5.0|Was delivered on time and in perfect condition.  The book is great so far.  Makes for a satisfying, if distracting, bathroom book (aka. That book that smells funny cause it's been sitting in the bathroom for so long...)    ~cloudy!~
B002LFPAUC|5.0|Having been a huge fan of this series since it first ran on PBS, I bought all the episodes years ago on VHS.  Hadn't gotten around to getting the DVD's, and now glad I waited for this special edition set.  I can highly recommend purchasing, even if you've never had the pleasure of viewing this comic classic before.  Sadly, only twelve episodes were made, but each one is pure gold, and infinitely superior to most sitcoms that run for years.  Can't wait to see all the extras.  The writing is genius; the cast is flawless--I could go on forever.  Thank you, John Cleese!
0596522347|5.0|I'm amazed by the negative reviews of this book.  I think they must be written by people who want to know how to create slides without understanding communication.    I read a review of slide:ology in Communication Arts magazine and knew I had to have it.  It's easily the most valuable book I've purchased this year.    Presentations are not about slides.  They are about connecting and communicating with an audience. Communication rarely comes from a singular source, but rather a dynamic package of messages.  Slideshows exist to enhance the dynamic package ... not BE the dynamic package.    Nancy Duarte gets it.  She does an incredible job of teaching the intracacies of different elements to create a supportive enhancement of whatever message you want an audience to leave your presentation with.     I've been a creative Powerpoint user and speaker for many years.  I use slide:ology frequently as a reference tool and for creative inspiration.  I recommend it frequently to others as the ultimate reference on communicating with a slideshow.       I don't even have a recommendation on how to make it better.  That is very rare for me!
B000071K5L|4.0|Who is Boo Radley? Why is Atticus defending a black man knowing that it is affecting his kids Jem and Scout? What does the title and cover have to do with the book? Who killed Bob Ewell?         Some of the main characters include Jem, Scout, Atticus, Calpurnia, Aunt Alexandra and Tom Robinson. The story starts out with Jem(10) and his sister Scout at the age of 6. The kids live with their father Atticus in Maycomb county located in Southern Alabama. Charters 1-12 cover the last couple years of their childhood before they start getting treated like young adults. In the beginning chapters Jem and Scout spend most of their summers with a boy named Dill who is a great friend of theirs. One of their favorite things to do was to try to get a neighbor of theirs named Boo Radley to come out of his house. Later on when fire struck Miss Maudies house Boo Radley would sneak out with a blanket to put on Scout and Jem as they watch a friendly neighbors house go up in flames on a cold winter night. In the middle of the book Jem and Scout's father Atticus, who is a lawyer, goes to court to defend Tom Robinson who was black and was accused of rape.          I think people should read this book because it is filled with myseries and always makes you think \\"is it a coincidence or did the Author mean it to be that way\\". One example of that in the book is the fact that Jem Scout and Atticus's last name is Finch. A finch is a small peaceful bird and the Finch's in the book are nice caring people. It also shows you exactly how poorly blacks were treated making it a good lesson on racism. The only reason why I would not reccomend this book is because it starts out slow and takes a while to read because of how small the print is.         Overall, this book is filled with hidden mysteries that take the best of readers to catch on to. I also shows what it was like back then with racism and the way blacks were treated.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|The funniest show to come on tv since two and a half men. These are fresh fun episodes which are funny each time you see them. I actually don't watch much tv, but I try never to miss this show. Check them out on you tube when they were at comic con. The cast and writers are so much fun, you'll be hooked on spending a half hour with them each week, and then buy this dvd season set so you can enjoy them again! Makes a great holiday gift no matter which holiday you observe!
0882709194|1.0|This silly wanker has taken Darwin's finest work and defecated right there in the front of it.  Ray Comfort is the sorriest excuse for an apologist we've seen and, without the ever-present internet to help bolster him, would have been taken out back and quietly locked away with the rest of the loonies.  To think he has perverted this beautiful work of science fact with his pseudo-science creationist drivel blows the mind.  The man must be stopped.  Don't buy this book, you'll only be encouraging him to defile more scientific texts with the help of his crockoduck loving fanboy, Kirk Cameron.    Even if you pull the intro out and donate the rest to a library or school, you're only encouraging this human jackal to produce more and pervert other books.
B001GQACGE|1.0|Recently purchased this Album along with Letoya Luckett's Lady Love Album thinking it would be better than B-day and contain more substance than the singles I heard on the radio like Diva and Ego.  I was wrong.  This album put meet to sleep.  It definitely could have been on Disc.  The only song I really like is Halo.  Overall I AM Sasha Fierce lacks substance and depth.  Her best solo album is Dangerously in love all others have been subpar.

Deciding to reconnect with their roots and go with a heavier, but not generic, sounding album was the best decision they could have possibly made... I have been waiting years for this album and to be honest... I was a little nervous that this album would not meet my expectations... but they're back! And they're better than EVER!
0385504225|5.0|I had read Dan Brown's other best-sellers practically straight through and this book was just as intriguing as the others.  I love how he just grabs you at the beginning and weaves the storylines throughout.  I'm a bit skeptical of some of the \\"facts\\" but loved reading how the weight of the body changes soon after death....YES!!!<br /><br />I didn't want it to end and look forward to the movie.
1596912863|4.0|First of all, I love Shannon Hale. I love her writing. This book was so unique and funny. It is short, to the point and I think there is a part of the main character, Jane, that most women can relate to.<br /><br />Jane is in her early 30's, single, and obsessed with Pride and Prejudice, particularly the BBC adaptation starring Colin Firth. Every relationship she has doesn't work out because, let's face it, who can stand up against Mr. Darcy.<br /><br />Jane's idea of love and how it should all work out is written out in Austen's words. When her aunt suddenly dies and leaves Jane an odd present she is forced to confront her obsession head-on. She sends her on a vacation to England. Not just any tour of the English countryside, but a full immersion into a Jane-Austen-style-theme resort. I love it! I wanted to go as I was reading it!<br /><br /> In her immersion in all things Austen, she connects with a part of herself deep inside and goes through a period of self-discovery.  She thought she knew what she wanted...but she was wrong.<br /><br />I don't care if I would look silly.  I would LOVE to go to an Austenlandish place for a few days.  What a fun way to get to play dress-up as an adult.  I have to praise Shannon Hale for the originality of this book.  It is a nice short read that flows well.  I like how it is written in limited 3rd person so we get a birds-eye view of every thing.<br /><br />I LOVED this book.  I don't say that about many books.  There are many I like a lot.  But this is one of the few I can say I loved.  There is something so real about Jane's character and how many women are in love with being in love.  We can get so preoccupied with the idea of \\"love\\" that we don't allow it to find us.  I loved Jane's journey.  I loved Pembrook Park.  I don't think I was or ever will be quite as obbsessed as Jane or some of the other guests, but wouldn't it be so much fun!<br /><br />I think that's what it is.  There is a little bit of Jane (the character, not Jane Austen) in all of us.  The fantasy man, escapism, ideas of ideal romances.  Jane is a bit on the extreme side, but we can all relate to her.  I highly recommend this book to any Austen or non-Austen fan.  It's a nice short read with plenty of substance.  One last note, this book is a totally clean read.  There is nothing that might make anyone squirm.  No language, sex scenes, etc.<br /><br />~Jenncapism, ideas of ideal romances.  Jane is a bit on the extreme side, but we can all relate to her.

0440242401|5.0|Sophie Kinsella has another hit on her hands... I started this book and couldn't put it down... a must read!
0321344758|4.0|Steve Krug's \\"Don't Make Me Think! A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability\\" focuses on the steps necessary to ensure that your Web site is user-friendly.  Steve Krug firmly believes that if something is too hard to use, people just won't use it.  The number one priority that Steve believes people should focus on to ensure that their Web site is easy to use is simply \\"Don't make me think!\\" This means that as far as humanly possible when a user looks at a Web page it should be self-evident, obvious, and self-explanatory.   Throughout his book, Steve focuses on the importance of understanding Web users and their needs. Krug's \\"Common Sense Approach to Web Usability\\" is broken up into these 12 topics:     1. Krug's First Law of Usability  2. Scanning, satisficing, and muddling through   3. Designing pages for scanning, not reading  4. Why users like mindless choices   5. The art of not writing for the Web  6. Designing navigation   7. Designing the Home page   8. Why most Web design teams arguments about usability are a waste of time, and how to avoid them   9. Why user testing--done simply enough--is the cure for all your sites ills  10. Usability as a common courtesy  11. Accessibility, cascading style sheets  12. What to do when your boss wants you to do something you consider a bad decision.        Understanding Web users, their needs, and the basics of what makes them think will help with the design of any Web site. The most often things that make users think according to Krug are cute or clever names, marketing induced names, company-specific names, and unfamiliar technical names. He also describes links and buttons that aren't obviously clickable as \\"another needless source of question marks over people heads.\\"  Understanding the basic principle of what causes confusion for people and how to eliminate that confusion is the most important thing you can do to stop users from having to \\"think\\".  The main reason it is so important not to make users think is because\\"most people are going to spend far less time looking at the pages we design than we'd like to think.\\" Therefore, Websites need to be as self-explanatory as possible so they can be effective even at a glace.       Krug spends a lot of time explaining how the design layout of the Web site should look to ensure easy usability, the importance of the search bar/box, as well as how the text content should be written in order to be most effective.  This book provided a lot of visual examples which helped readers to better understand what the details of the site should look like.  Without the visuals, I would have been completely lost. A large portion of the book was also dedicated to Web navigation and designing the Home page.  This is simply because the Home page is the first page users see and if people can't find their way around your Web site then they won't use it.  I found these chapters to be particularly useful.         For those people who are working either alone or on a Web design team to design a Web site for a company or organization, this book offers great information on how to perform usability testing, particularly how to perform usability testing on a budget.  It also touches on how to make your team the most productive they can be.    \\"Don't Make Me Think!\\" is the second edition to Steve Krug's first book that was published five years ago.  Steve was reluctant to write a second edition, he worried that if he added more material the book would no longer \\"practice what it preaches\\".  The book itself is a good example of what Web usability means, it's easy to understand and very straight forward. It was designed to be a short two hour \\"airplane\\" read which made it all the more appealing.  As someone who hasn't read the first edition of the book, however, I don't know to what extent they differ but I feel that the additional chapters of the second edition (Usability as a common courtesy, Accessibility, Cascading Style Sheets, and you, and Help! My boss wantsme to ______.) were unnecessary and a little off topic.  I really enjoyed reading the entire book until chapter 10, the information provided after that was not useful for me personally and but perhaps others will find it valuable and enjoy it.     Overall, I would rate the book four out of five stars.  I found it to be very interesting and an enjoyable read.  The fact that it is so short, simple, and to the point made me feel as though Steve Krug was indeed \\"practicing what he preached.\\" He talked a lot about making the Web users feel like you do understand and respect that their time is precious and that's how I felt when reading this book.  I also found myself laughing out loud a few times which always helps to make a book more pleasing.  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is designing a Web site. The little time that it will take you to read this book is nothing compared to the money that you will save by creating a functional and user-friendly Web site.
0385504225|1.0|Had it not been for the \\"puzzle,\\" I would have stopped reading this book before 100 pages.  I had to see if what I figured out early on was the answer.  The Washington Monument seemed too obvious.    The early American Masons must have had too much time on their hands if they went to all that trouble to hide their \\"treasure.\\"    To use the same device to create suspense at the end of almost every chapter is a bit much.    If this book came with a money back guarantee, I would be $16.95 richer.
0375842209|5.0|This is a remarkable book. It deals with death and war but in a different way. Written by an Australian and apparently for the young adult market. I would definitely say its more of an adult book even though the main character is a young girl and it follows her life during the war in Germany. I highly recommend this book.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I have a problem with earphones falling out of my ears but this one is simply perfect. It doesnt press ur ears as the  usual headfones does nor it just vacuums out air like the earbuds....This is perfect. Grab one before the price increases
0439023483|4.0|Right when I read the cover I knew this was going to be an amazing book. Hunger Games is about this country that was divided into 13 districts until they blew up district 13 because of problems adn every year they have an annual hunger game challenge, they choose one girl and one boy from every district. During a reaping to pick the one boy and one girl from every distric Katniss's younger sister, Prim was chosen. But Katniss took her spot because she didnt want ther sister to die. Okay now that i have told you what it is sorta about I will give you my take on this book. In the first part of the book it was a struggle for me to read because it was so boring. When I got to the second part of the book, man was i blown away, during the reality part of the show aguy named Prim pretended thata he was madly in love with this hairy beast who had to be shaved before to look not like a monster. Wow, there is so much detail I almost hopped into the book. Like a kid spitting blood onto her face and it can get pretty gory. The book is written in first person that I liked and disliked because you can not jump from people to people and you just have to stay with Katniss the whole time. I hated the ending to this book because it didn't make me want to read the next book, Catching Fire. They say they are making a movie but if they make this PG-13 they would have to take away a lot of the book so don't be surprised if the movie is going to be rated R. Overall this book is a really good book I would recommend this for teens and adults 'cause it can get very descriptive.
1576754227|5.0|Eat That Frog is an excellent anti-procrastination book.  Much of procrastination comes from doing a dreaded task, even if that task is important to you or others.  Using this metaphor, the author breaks down these issues and encourages you to do that which you have been putting off.  I now refer to my most important project of the day as 'eating my frog'.<br /><br />Regarding the reviewers who have stated that information later in the book is contrary to the author's overall view, I disagree.  You can use more than one method when it comes to achieving your goals.  Just because you are working on your most important project doesn't mean that you can't break it down in to manageable parts, or set aside a specific time to work on it, or use other techniques to accomplish what you need to do.
B002GZQY6Q|2.0|Let's face it. As great as Steve Wilson can be, at least half of what he does is boring beyond belief. PT are one of those bands, not unlike many others, that release albums where only half the songs are worth listening to most of the time. Of course, the other half of what he does is pure genius.<br /><br />If that's true as a general rule, The Incident is pure karma- the dismal compliment to the near-flawless Deadwing.<br /><br />The Incident, unfortunately, sounds more like a SW solo project than it does the band we've heard on the last two records. Perhaps SW and the gang are giving us too much too soon, but I can't help feeling like there's a shortage of ideas here. The single, Time Flies, basically sets the tone for the rest of the album, which is unfortunate because it's not a great single.<br /><br />2/5. Porcupine Tree are capable of much better, but sound like they're thinning. For the fans who don't like the heavier sound of FoaBP, this album is a welcome return to the \\"lighter\\" PT most people recognize. However, that's about the only potential improvement I can think of that this has over the last album, and for fans like this one that's not such an improvement at all.

0060254920|5.0|I re-read \\"Where The Wild Things Are\\" for the first time in perhaps 15 years, if not longer the day after the film was released.  There is and was a spirit in the succinct language that kids get, if they are allowed.  You see, they are more wild than mature and refined.  The idea that they might be able to escape the confines of growing up is so attractive.   I have heard complaints from parents \\"not getting it.\\"     I am certain of this.  They impose their restrictive, lemming like ignorance on their kids and say that if I don't get this, then you must not either.  Their children model what they see.  A courageous parent is one who earnestly strives to remember the exact treasure of a fort, a jungle, an adventure, and truly being wild...and then gives this privileged opportunity to their children with encouragement.
B002MW50KO|1.0|I was appalled to hear how bad Bob Dylan's voice has gotten. I played it for several friends, many of whom weren't sure it even WAS Bob Dylan. Most commented that, if not for his past success, most any label (certainly not a major one) would have NEVER released such a dreadful series of tracks on CD or any other medium. Dylan is another reason that the tobacco drug must be banned now!

B002LVVCQM|3.0|As one who has read Dawkins for many years, as have many of you, I have presented his arguments (age of the earth, genetics, DNAtics, etc.) many times with 'true believers.'  I have won a few few and lost many to what a good scientist would call illogical and unprovable (interesting word in a sea of no legitimate 'proofs,' but (maddeningly) just strong inference and 'falsification'). Dawkin's great show is a debate between books, not concepts. There is a possible non-book irrefutable argument:  IF....IF....God is, the creator of untold galaxies (including our 'delicious' Milky Way) and IF He sought to test us, and perhaps many others elsewhere, is it possible that he simply created everything in situ. One who could do what we see and experience, after all, could do anything. What a 'sting' THAT would be, eh! We'll see.  We'll all see...eventually.
0316069906|5.0|I wholeheartedly recommend this book. I identified with Foer as a person who really tries to eat ethically, but whose weaknesses often get the best of him. I've had strong intuitions that there is something wrong with Meat today, but, like Foer reports of his own journey, those intuitions have not been strong enough for me to really change what I eat. The woman in my life, by contrast, has been a vegetarian for over a decade and never wavers. Of the many changes I've made to accommodate our relationship, giving up meat was never one of them. I've generally let the smell of bacon silence any discomfort I had with meat. That is, until reading Eating Animals. Foer's personal narrative spoke to me more than any of the many exposes on factory farming slyly sent my way.  At the same time, Eating Animals left me far more informed than I was before ... It's the standard cliché, but I really couldn't put the book down. In place of the didactic or moralistic, Foer welcomes the reader into his life and his story. Foer is his own main character, and his own self-examination inspires the same. You won't be the same after reading it.
B002MW50KY|1.0|Let me begin by saying that I LOVE Bob, but a Christmas album?  C'mon, Bob. I have been doing parodies of \\"Bob Sings Christmas\\" for years, complete with nasaly highs and gravely lows, and always getting laughs.  But, I NEVER dreamed it would become reality.  The ONLY way this \\"contribution\\" can be taken seriously is that all proceeds are for charity.      What next, Bob, a cappella or gregorian chant perhaps?
0739350463|5.0|\\"Treasure Island\\" (Audiobook)<br />by Robert Louis Stevenson<br />Read by Alfred Molina<br />(Listening Library, 2007)<br />----------------------------------------<br />This is an excellent, exciting audiobook version of Robert Louis Stevenson's classic pirate saga... Actor Alfred Molina is great as the book's narrator.  Highly recommended! (Joe Sixpack, ReadThatAgain book reviews)
B002P7UCMC|5.0|This is easily their hardest album ever, or at the very least in years. Also it was excellent from end to end as far as I'm concerned, I personally like the lighter songs sprinkled about, you can't keep a hard tempo up forever, and lets the harder songs maintain their impact. Rammlied is a declaration the band has returned from an overly long absence with only Volkerball to comfort hardcore fans between Rosenrot and now. I can easily picture this song as the opener for the current round of touring, hopefully Reise Reise will still be used as the encore opener.     A solid row of hard grinding songs follow with \\"Ich Tu Dir Weh\\" being a harder faster song but still along the lines of Wo bist Du, the raucous Waidmann's Heil, and slows a little with Haifisch (Shark) a very danceable tune. Buckstabu, a song who's title is a word the band made up (to mean anything) is another hard one. The first break is with Fruhling in Paris a melodic tune that is very enjoyable in its own way, and provides a break for the dark, slow building and structurally interesting Wiener Blut, a song based on the Fritzl case in Vienna about a father who turned his own daughter into his personal sex slave (not exactly a new direction for the band given the inspiration for Mein Teil).     Pussy is an interesting song, popish, crude, most of the lyrics in English, yet very enjoyable, a debauched ditty about sexual tourism (fitting given that the Ukraine is advertising its legal prostitution and great exchange rate with the Euro recently) From here till the finale of Roter Sand its more hard, grinding and grand Rammstein. Roter Sand follows a pattern of a softer finish, a haunting western ballad, the whistling and guitar work being immediate clues to the setting its sending you to, also some background keyboards which actually reminded me of Wall of Voodoo's \\"Call of the West\\".    Easily the most enjoyable Rammstein Album since Mutter, and I really liked Reise Reise (Dali Lamah and Keine Lust beingfavorites) and Rosenrot (the title track, Benzin, and Wo bist Du greatly enjoyed to boot). This is a must have for any serious Rammstein fan.    The bonus disc features 2 more songs that follow the pattern of the album, though Donnaukinder hints to earlier songs from previous albums with its dark fairy tale like melodies, the last two are a more orchestral version of Roter Sand, and Liese is really Roter Sand with different lyrics, and gave the impression of a much different setting to the song.

B001U0HBPG|5.0|This is a long, slow movie, but it is quite astonishing.    At first, there is a little smugness at the general concept: a man is born old and grows younger with time.    But the movie quickly transcends its gimmick-premise, and becomes by turns tragic, and touching, and illuminating, and funny, and amazing, and quietly wonderful.    Brad Pitt's quiet performance is a perfect counterpoint to Cate Blanchett's hyper frenzy.  You can see how these two attract each other.  You can also see how Button (Pitt) would be attracted to the unfulfilled, still-waiting, always-wanting-to-conquer-the-Channel character played by Tilda Swinton.    He himself is also waiting, for something neither he nor anyone else can envision.    And so the movie works subtly to give a powerful sensation of what it feels like to be alive: things happening that are profound, moving, silly, heartbreaking, wonderful, sad, ordinary, unexpected, shocking--all coming into your life, and then moving away like a ship on the horizon.    The fact that the two principal characters' life-arcs are opposite--Blanchett getting older and more sedate, Pitt getting younger and more lively--and can only meet for a touching, tragic moment, is both terribly romantic and exactly right.    This is the way things work.  Nothing lasts.    But, as the lightning-victim says, every day things come along that make it wonderful to be alive.    A profound, interesting, very unusual movie.    It is also quite tricky.  There are subtle, and sometimes not-so-subtle, hints of reincarnation (the hummingbird).  But, very satisfyingly, the whole plot is shifted forward in time and ends with the cataclysm of Hurricane Katrina slamming into New Orleans, destroying, or seeming to destroy, this entire cycle of death-and-rebirth.    Powerful, puzzling, sublime.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|We saw one episode of this BBC produced series on the Discovery channel several months ago and we were sold. This series is a beautifully depicted narration on the wonderful planet we call home. The documentary is filmed almost exclusively in High Definition and the cinematography is simply stunning in Blu-ray.<br />We are using a 1080p 120Hz Toshiba Regza as our reference and the picture quality is at times breathtaking. The producers went to great lengths to capture amazing images of the entire planet and just watching the scenery alone is worth the price of this set. There is one shot taken as they flew over Victoria falls that almost makes you feel like you are soaring over the falls on your own personal set of wings.<br />While the Discovery Channel series is narrated by Sigourney Weaver and the Disney edited version is done by James Earl Jones; this original series is narrated by David Attenborough with the BBC and he is by far the best of the three. The only issues I had with the physical Blu-ray discs is that Mr. Attenborough's voice is slightly hard to hear over the higher volume musical scores and scenery sounds.<br />This set comes in a nice box for display and has 4 discs inside. The length is approximately 550 minutes and is divided into 50 minute themed segments.<br />I should also note that there are a few references (maybe 4 or 5) to evolution and global warming for those of you who may have issues with these types of views. However, the focus is not on politics or religion, rather the main focus is on our amazing planet and I do not believe the commentaries would be offensive to anyone who is solid in their own beliefs. In my opinion the stunning imagery reinforces the ideas of creation by design and the entire series would be an excellent educational resource for any type of school or home.<br />The wonder and awesomeness of this planet really shines in this series and I highly recommend it.
B002SJIO54|5.0|I won't spoil the plot like another has.  I will tell you that this is probably the best movie I've seen since Blood Diamond or The Kingdom.  It isn't made for the kiddies, it's rather violent at times, down right gory at others, and actually makes you think about humanity.  The movie isn't about aliens. It's about Apartheid, and instead of blacks and whites in South Africa, it has a different race completely. The director, Neill Blomkamp grew up in South Africa and understands how to make this story work. So, instead of blacks being mistreated by whites, we have an alien ship composed of the (for lack of a better term) working class portion of the race that is fairly docile and prone to following directions.  Throw in the social commentary and some thought provoking images of how poorly we would probably treat these visitors, with a little bit of Dr Mengale, and it makes for an outstanding and truly intense movie rarely delivered these days.  There is no Brad Pitt or Angelina Jolie, in fact, there isn't anybody most people in the States would recognize, but they all deliver an outstanding performance within a fantastic plot.  If you thrive on the types of movies with idiotic violence, no real story, characters with no emotion/ acting ability/ or development, then go watch the Transformers series and clean the drool from your shirt and attempt to recover your hearing at the door.  If you want a movie that incorporates some great science fiction, which is all about how we interact with the unknown, then it is completely worth renting and if you love it, worth buying.
B00005N5RM|5.0|This is the kind of horror movie I love. You like the characters, the monster is super cool, and you even get a happy ending!. I saw this in High school back when it hit theaters, and it has been one of my favorites ever sense. I showed it to my my wife, who hates scary movies,and it scared her to death. Any horror fan probably won't be very scared, but this is really a fun popcorn,good time. I would have loved a sequel to this, because every crappy horror seemed to get a sequel, but no. This one will stand alone,and I can't recommend this enough. Great, great movie!
B00260HH3K|1.0|The movie sucked big time. Im a huge fan of DBZ and have all the cartoons/sagas/animation movies for it. This live action rendering does no justice to the DBZ franchise and heres whys:  1) the fight b/w picollo and goku lasts one minute and has no detail. In the cartoon, entire episodes were devoted to long drawn out battles between the hero and the villain.  2) the special effects are mediocre.  3) the actor playing goku doesnt have charisma for this role.  4) too much screen time is devoted to goku and his 'trying to be cool' and him 'trying to get the girl'.  5) the plot is weak, has many unexplained segments, and doesnt really go with the time lines laid out int he cartoons.    Avoid the DVD!

1401323820|4.0|New York City is suffering from record breaking heat when Matthew Starr jumps to his death from his luxury condo.  NYPD detective Nikki Heat quickly determines that it was murder.  And since Matthew was one of the richest developers in the city, the case will be a top priority.<br /><br />Only Nikki quickly discovers that Matthew wasn't as well off as everyone thought he was.  As the secrets come out, Nikki begins to find multiple motives.  Then her own life is threatened.  Can she solve the crime before another attempt is made?<br /><br />It's always a danger killing off a popular character, but if that's what it took to give us this new book, than I am glad Richard Castle took that risk....<br /><br />Okay, okay, so the whole Richard Castle thing is not true.  This book is really a very cleverly done tie in to the ABC show Castle.  Heck, the author photo on the back of the book is actor who plays him on the show.  And the blurbs are from authors who have appeared on the show.  Frankly, this fan couldn't stop laughing at the similarities.<br /><br />Those similarities continue on to the characters.  Nikki Heat is being shadowed by a news reporter for an in depth feature on the police force.  The other detectives are quite obviously based on the characters in the show.<br /><br />However, I must wonder just how much non-fans of the show would appreciate things.  I got lots of humor from characters and comparing the two.  If I didn't know the show, I wouldn't have found it amusing at all.<br /><br />The plot holds together reasonably well.  The beginning of the book was overwritten, however.  Some of those sentences got in the way of actually understanding the description.  Things did get better as the book progressed, fortunately.<br /><br />Fans of the TV show will get a kick out of this book, especially with how they've been advertising it on the show.  Others might enjoy it, but they won't get the same kick out of it I did.

B000JK8OYU|5.0|first - yes it is the beatles and not a mama mia type other people doing the songs thing. If you want the beatles in 5.1 this is as good as your going to get. However dont expect a beatles album- they never made one called Love, its the soundtrack of a musical not a beatles cd they do things with songslike merge-blend and accapella, but on the whole consdering they took years to come ouyt with remasters of the beatles cataloug that was barely (if any) improvment on the 87 releases (which are good by the way)- I doubt if your going to have any other option of getting the beatles on 5.1 so despite the messing with some songs Get it if you want beatles in 5.1- sounds awesome.

0385504225|2.0|Mr. Brown's \\"formula\\" for book writing is alive and well. Too bad his plots are not. An interesting read with a few twists and turns, but the ending was disappointing. As a Freemason, I had to laugh at times. It's obvious that whoever Mr. Brown got his Masonic information from either didn't tell him correctly, or it was too boring to write about without much \\"embellishment\\". Too much like \\"Dune\\" and not enough like \\"Indiana Jones\\". It could have been so much better. Overall I give it two (2) stars.

This is one of those cds you should have on a top 200 basis, especially if you love 90's music. The singles on this album are superb, but even the non-single tracks are awesome. The title track is epic. Also good are Happy Now, End it On This and World Go Round. Classic Ska, Classic 90's, and just good stuff all around.

0380730405|4.0|****Warning: SPOILERS****<br /><br />The Rebecca of DuMaurier's novel is more ambiguous than her film counterpart.  Though in film and book she is revealed to us by the self-interested (and justifying) second Mrs. De Winter, there are sufficient departures to create a more complex dead woman. One is sorrier for her in the book than in the film, but the film condenses much, leaving less time for reflection, tempting quick judgment.<br /><br />I don't think it was mentioned in the film, but \\"Danny\\" Danvers, the maid of the film, in book and film alike clinging to Rebecca's clothes, pillowcases, and other finery with evident homoerotic longing, is the woman who raised Rebecca from birth. She tells what a \\"beauty\\" Rebecca was from the age of 12. Rebecca had no mother, just Danvers.  Insert your own conclusions. Favell, as in the film, is introduced as Rebeccca's \\"first cousin,\\" but while this seemed like a euphemism for a returning lover, in the book he is confirmed as a first cousin with whom she probably had a sexual relationship. The whiff of something verging on incest is strong in both cases. Certain subtleties, like Maxim's remark that at any party there were a few others, or in a particular instance a half dozen \\"persons\\" that Rebecca took to her cottage to spend the nights, and the parallel of Rebecca in trousers to \\"a boy with the face of a Boticelli angel,\\" strongly suggest the character's bisexuality. With all the priggishness of 1938 Maxim assures us \\"Rebecca...was not even normal.\\" Going back and reading the first chapter (as anyone must upon reading the last page) the second Mrs. DeWinter seemed smug, bratty, naive.<br /><br />A note on the doctor visited at the end of the Hitchcock version, to find out if Rebecca was pregnant on the night of her death. In the film he is shown in lurid shadows, as if to suggest the character's need of a dispenser of anti-biotics, birth control and perhaps even abortion after her many debauches. In the book, he is a reputable physician operating in daylight. Rebecca only saw him once, to confirm her mortal illness (uterine cancer). Danvers, with the confidence of her intimate relationship with Rebecca, whatever it may have been, assures everyone that Rebecca was \\"above all that.\\" Her acts with her cousin notwithstanding, one wonders about Rebecca's true identity, sexual or otherwise. I even found myself wondering whether she might have been gay. Rebecca disclosed something to Maxim on Day 5 of their marriage that turned it into a \\"deal\\" and \\"arrangement.\\"<br /><br />I was also very dissapointed to read that in the book Maxim shot Rebecca dead in the heart, at close range. In the film it was an accident, and I could sympathize with him and his bride as a result.  But Max -- good family name notwithstanding, it's called a DIVORCE. Why kill her?

0307266303|4.0|Born to Run by Christopher McDougall is an extremely interesting book, but it surprised me in places with its unevenness. The subtitle on the cover of the book mentions a hidden tribe, super athletes, and the greatest race the world has never seen. All three areas are covered in the book, and they form the crux of the story. However, the book offers much more than that, sometimes successfully and sometimes not.<br /><br />Mr. McDougall wonders why his foot always hurts when he begins a running campaign - a question that has come to a lot of us. His search for an answer eventually led him to the extremely reclusive Tarahumara Indians of Mexico's Copper Canyons. The Tarahumara have always been known for incredible feats of running. Getting to experience these people turns out to be extremely difficult, and the author finally relies on the assistance of the mysterious Caballo Blanco, an American loner who lives in the area of the Tarahumara and seems to spend most of his time running the mountain trails. We also are introduced to the ultramarathoners in the United States who are running extremely long races basically for the satisfaction of showing that they can finish. A few of these people end up going to the Copper Canyons with Mr. McDougall to run with the Tarahumara in a race through the mountains, i.e., the greatest race the world has never seen. All of these sections of the book are excellent. The Tarahumara are an interesting people. The ultramarathoners are a wild bunch, and the race itself is great. Fascinating stuff.<br /><br />My only hesitation with Born to Run is the amount of time spent exploring injuries resulting from running and the theory that many of the problems runners experience today are the result of the expensive, heavily-padded running shoes that most people use. Are such shoes good for us or are they the main cause of the problems? Mr. McDougall explores at length the theory that the best way for our bodies to run is either barefoot or with minimal protection for the feet. He gives a history of the development of the modern running shoe and quotes a number of studies that support the benefits of running without shoes. This was interesting for a while, but I just have a lot of trouble accepting completely that the theory is correct.<br /><br />All in all, Born to Run is a good book. Just keep in mind that it covers a lot more ground than simply introducing us to a reclusive tribe of runners in Mexico and a boisterous bunch of long-distance runners in the States. If you are particularly interested in reclusive Indian tribes in rugged country in Mexico, I also recommend Richard Grant's book God's Middle Finger: Into the Lawless Heart of the Sierra Madre. Nothing to do with running, it is more about drug dealers and the impossibly rough country in that part of Mexico, but it is a fascinating story.on for the feet.

B00005KK4P|3.0|Originally purchased with great anticipation from the 30 second excepts on the disk. Once they arrived, I found excitement fading as I played through the collection. Having enjoyed Franz Schubert's work in concert performance and  personal recordings, the enjoyable style and melodies of Schubert's symphonies are familiar. Playing these recordings for the first time the outdated old & broken feel gave immediate dislike. Slowed themes, notably in the first movements of 8 and 9 hurt the performance. The works, written in Allegro, and yet performed in Grave` tempos. This direction only grows more tiresome moving through the disks. Tempos aside the phrasing and fruition of themes give the general feeling, the orchestra plays the notes but is unable to hear music from the notes.    Not all bad, the performances of symphonies 5 & 6 on disk 3 are enjoyable, thought of keeping the set for these recordings. And, the interpretation of 1 & 2 in D/B are well done.    As a whole, I returned the recordings, unhappy with the disregard of tempos and general music notations composed by Schubert. Finally, I will continue to look for the reference recordings of Schubert's beloved symphony collection.

0385504225|3.0|I couldn't put the book down. Dan Brown knows how to write a suspenseful story, with plenty of surprises--so many that, ironically, I began to anticipate some of them. The symbols and \\"puzzles\\" relating to art and architecture were fun, and I was able to decipher some of them. BUT...impossible that so much could happen in a 10-hour span, and even more impossible that mere mortals could endure physically the trials they undergo in that time period. I could have done with about 100 fewer pages and far fewer \\"philosopical\\" passages. I caught on to the big message quite early in the game. Still, I've read books that have far less to offer!
0882709194|1.0|THIS IS NOT A BOOK FOR CHILDREN! The first 50 pages is scientific baby barf (metaphorically speaking) and the rest is meant for a mildly intelligent audience, not little children who will read it, not understand it, and conclude for the rest of their lives that the idea is ridiculous.
0440237688|1.0|As much as I wanted to love this book, I cannot.    I adore sci-fi and dystopic novels, but this books writing was just awful. Lowry leaves an absurd amount of questions unanswered and it's seriously like she just gave up on the ending. It's almost as if she decided it would be better left like that, so all the school kids who have to read this worthless book are forced to write an ending as part of their grade for \\"The Giver\\"'s unit.     I don't believe in censorship (it basically says to teenagers \\"I'm banned! Therefore, I MUST be good if your teachers don't want you to read me.\\"), but I definitely don't believe this book belongs up there with all of the other great classics that kids are required to read, like \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\". If you are interested in bringing young adults into this genre, I suggest \\"The Hunger Games\\" by Suzanne Collins.    Such an amazing idea falls flat on its face.    1 out of 5 stars.

B001FB55H6|1.0|If 0 stars was an option, I would have chosen it. The action was alright, and some of the toys and costumes were alright. I didn't like some of the cheesy lines and some of the fight scenes. I didn't like how they tried to make it so \\"dark\\"...as if the world isn't already dark enough! I didn't like the plot...a good guy turning bad, killing his own kind/friends...and trying to destroy the world...lame! People want happy endings, especially if they are going to see a superhero movie. Finally, my biggest problem with this movie was entirely too much blue schlong!!! I mean, if they would have had a shot where they \\"glanced\\" over it as the camera was panning to something else, that would have been enough. But NOOOO...they had full on 30 second shots with him walking towards you or just standing there with that smurfy blue prosthetic thing hanging there. Why would I pay all that money to see a superhero/action movie, then see some fake smurf weenie for half the movie. I would have walked out if I hadn't spent so much on the bloody movie...and also I was in the middle of a dark theater and would have tripped all over everyone trying to get down the aisle. My gf is permanently scarred for life thanks to those scenes. It was just entirely too exorbitant and unnecessary. Whoever edited that movie needs to be fired...and the Directors need some serious counseling!!

0765322889|5.0|The story starts with the encounter between a boy called Ganoes Paran and the Sergeant Wiskeyjack during the final year of the Emperor Kellanved's reign. Ganoes, who's in Malaz City with his father, witnesses the raiding of the Mouse Quarter. During their conversation, Wiskeyjack disapproves the young Ganoes' dreams of becoming a soldier.<br /><br />Then the book fast forwards seven years: Emperor Kellanved and his ally called Dancer have been assassinated. Since then, the Empire has been ruled by the Empress Laseen whose eyes are set on the Genabackis continent. The Malazan 2nd army is besieging Pale, one of the two free cities remaining on this continent. And we find Wiskeyjack and Ganoes Paran among the many characters whose lives are touched by these events.<br /><br />Wow! I just discovered that reading Erikson is a very fulfilling experience, in many ways. It's like drinking a pint of Murphy's (if you're asking \\"a pint of what?\\", it's like Guinness but it's better :). It's a superior stout from Cork, Ireland): It's tasty, it's rich, it has character, it has depth...<br /><br />Gardens Of The Moon had been on my to-read list for a long while and I don't quite know why, I had always had something else to read. I mean, I don't know why I preferred to read something else but you know how it works. You have a list in your mind and depending on your mood you reshuffle that. Or you have a nice blog that you follow, you read a new review and bang! The list is reordered.<br /><br />Anyway... I'm glad that I decided to plunge into the Malazan world. After a few dozen pages, I put the book down and I asked myself \\"Have I missed a few introductory chapters? Was there a book before Gardens Of The Moon?\\" It seems that it's normal to feel a bit lost in the beginning. It turns out that Erikson tells a story as it happens without constant background information giving. This becomes a very interesting style. On the one hand, potentially boring introductory chapters are avoided and it creates further mystery, and on the other hand the book reads like a real life event. Almost like the reader is a true witness to the story unfolding before her eyes but because she just arrived, she doesn't have much background information, naturally. So, at this point, if the reader is patient enough to follow Erikson's lead, she's rewarded by a window opening onto an incredible universe. I understand, now, what the author himself meant by saying \\"you either like it or you don't\\". Luckily I liked it very very much.<br /><br />My first introduction to fantasy happened when I started to read my uncle's Conan comic books during my childhood. I still enjoy reading Conan, every now and then. The richness and the possibilities offered by the universe and the setting in Gardens Of The Moon reminded me of the Conan universe. Please don't get me wrong. I'm not suggesting that the storylines or the styles are similar. It's just that the world created by Steven Erikson and Ian Cameron Esslemont is so rich with martial action, diverse races, deities, magical warrens, types of magic wielders, demons, armies, long forgotten civilizations, myths, etc. that the comparison came to me naturally, I guess.<br /><br />The book has parallel stories running at the same time. Jumping from one story to another one is very frequent. And as I've already mentioned, it is rich in characters. My favourite ones are Anomander Rake, Whiskeyjack, the mysterious Kalam and Quick Ben who seems to be so much more than a simple mage. There are so many others: Irritating Tattersail, the confusing Ganoes Paran, the fat Kruppe, the young Crokus, Rallick Nom the assassin, Toc the Younger (I have the feeling that we're going to meet him again in a later book)... there are so many of them who make the whole book a delight to read. Furthermore, I found it was easy to connect with most of the characters.<br /><br />Despite feeling lost in the beginning, Gardens Of The Moon ended up being a brilliant read. So much so that I had to continue with the second book of the Malazan Book of the Fallen series immediately after finishing the first one.

0307454541|4.0|I am reading this book on Kindle.  It's a great book.  But I am frustrated by Kindle's disadvantage of apparently being incapable of reproducing display pages such as the one with the Vanger family tree in big enough type to read.  So far, there are two pages in the book like this and I so want to be able to view these pages.  Is there any way Amazon/Kindle could make these kinds of pages available to print out?  The same thing applies to books, especially autobiographies/memoirs with photographs.  Otherwise I love the Kindle.  And this is a \\"can't put down\\" novel.
B002C6K7N0|5.0|First off, I only review on this site when I'm really loving a new release, so don't think I'm blowin' smoke. This is my favorite Megadeth album since The World Needs A Hero. For those who are not into it yet, I'd recommend listening to it while you're driving for at least a couple weeks and then see how you feel about it.     This album does have a progressive metal sound to it, which is probably why I love it so much. And like The World Needs A Hero, it'll cure any drummer's cravings for some inspiration. Shawn's drumming has evolved into something ferocious. As usual, the guitars are top-notch, kinda surprised after listening that there's a new guitar player here, sounds like he's been with the band all along.     I think this album is lyrically and musically what Megadeth has needed to prove that they shouldn't pack it in yet. And fear not if like myself, you weren't crazy about the last album United Abominations, cause this album blows it away. I can't tell if it's the production or that the material here is just better-rehearsed or what, but I believe this is my favorite release of 2009 and by far the best Megadeth has sounded in a way too long.
0805209999|5.0|I'm assuming that the other reviews have already given you a summary of the plot.<br /><br />Why Should you read this book?<br /><br />You will find some very deep and practical philosophy within the context of a novel containing long flowing sentences and paragraphs that can span page upon page leaving you gasping for breath as you take in the layered situations that Kafka, a true artist of existential inspiration, a creative mastermind of vague wordings with mutiple meanings, and a crafter of text that grows from page one into a twisted story, presents to you while you turn the pages of this engaging novel that will result in your reflection upon life and reality along with a greater interest for Kafka's other works which will lead you to more questions and little answers; this process will take you in circles until you may have found yourself and your own explanations that can serve your mind as you read Kafka, for Kafka's situations can be replaced by any situation or life experience, and in the end you will come to the end or middle of Kafka's last sentence and realize that the concluson or ending was not necessary, for the text is living wilst containing wise words waiting to be devoured.
141654917X|4.0|My Sister's Keeper    Jodi Picoult    Contemporary Fiction    In an effort to save one of its own a Rhode Island family has lost its identity and way. The story revolves around Kate who has rare form of cancer and the effort to keep her alive by her family. However, the care and medical attention needed depends on the youngest child in the family, Anna. Her birth gave new life to her sick sister. Anna is a perfect genetic match to Kate. Anna has given everything to Kate from blood to bone marrow. Anna is told that she will give her kidney to her sister. However, Anna does not want to continue to be a guinea pig any longer. She decides that her parents have to look out for all their children not just Kate. Anna will take them to court if she must. This sets the stage for \\"My Sister's Keeper\\".     Jodi Picoult is a unique writer. Each chapter is from a different character's perspective making the story anything but onesided. Picoult reminds me of Alice McDermott.     Reading the book feels like sitting at a dining room table at a dinner party. Each guest taking a turn to tell you their side of the story.   What worked magnificently  The book as a whole works quite well. By changing the perspective every chapter the reader is allowed a full profile of the entire story. By employing this device Picoult allows you as the reader to be completely entrenched in the plotline.    All of the characters are believable but Sara who is the mother never is able to connect with me. I don't know if that was by design but it was disappointing that such a pivotal character never had an impact on me as the reader.    Picoult is the standard bearer for contemporary fiction today. She is the author of this generation.    Many consider \\"My Sister's Keeper\\" as the definitive Picoult novel. I disagree. This book is a wonderful read and I highly reccomend it. However, I think Picoult's \\"Nineteen Minutes\\" is her best work.   What books are most similar to this book?  As I mentioned earlier Alice McDermott and her novels have some similarities to Piccoult's work. Tom Perrotta and Alice Sebold are two contemporaries of Picoult that have the ability to make their characters part of your life.     If you like this book, you will probably like....  \\"The Appeal\\" by John Grisham or \\"The Abstinence Teacher\\" by Tom Perrotta or \\"That Night\\" by Alice McDermott    If you hate this book, you will probably like....  \\"Coma\\" by Robin Cook and \\"The Stranger\\" by Albert Camus
B000OVLBF8|5.0|I felt the price was very reasonable for the movie since it was new. It was shipped and received within the specified time that was given at the time of ordering.  And when the movie came it was in excellent condition, well packaged to keep it protected from any damage.
0312427999|5.0|This book is at the same time very scary and very exciting. The book starts out slowly talking about things like electric shock therapy experiments done decades ago and you wonder what this has to do with the goal of the book to talk about economic issues. However, by the end of the book, the theme of shock therapy is well-cultivated. In any case, this book represents an ambitious project. It basically attempts to view the period from the late 1960s through the present from the perspective of what it calls Chicago School Capitalism. The author traces worldwide attempts to install a free-wheeling laissez faire type capitalism via shocks of one kind or another. She details many kinds of shocks ranging from military coups featuring brutal repression to man-made or natural disasters. The basic crux of the story is that in one country after another, a shock to citizens was utilized to bring a massive wave of privatization, social spending cuts and deregulation. This policy was advocated by the famous almost god-like economist Milton Friedman, but rather than praise the strategy, the author points out how in instance after instance this led to severe economic poverty for large sectors of the population and many other negative effects. She details how many international agencies and governments were in on the process from the US government to the IMF and World Bank. Just when the reader becomes severely depressed over the bleak picture, she ends the book with a hopeful section pointing out how many areas have managed to turn this around into a new third way that offers real hope and significant protection from future shocks.<br /><br />The thing I liked best about this book is that it offers a coherent narrative that makes sense of all the things I have seen on the news in my life, which roughly covers the same time period as this book. Obviously, real life isn't so neat and clean as to perfectly fit a well-constructed 600 page synopsis of 40 years of world history, but this is a good attempt to make sense out of something that can seem confusing. For me there is a real disconnect, in many cases, between the high-minded rhetoric of free markets and unfettered capitalism and the results we see in the real world. I think everyone suspects that things don't work out as neatly as promised. We can see hints of trouble all around even though there is a constant veneer of success held up in the media when talking about the places where these shock-based free-market experiments took place. This book presents a viewpoint that makes a lot of these things appear more coherent. For example, if you view Iraq as a free-market experiment and not as a project in democracy and security, what happened there makes more sense.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who is genuinely concerned about the world economy and the direction that society is taking. It's probably not a book for those who want to view the world in polar terms and imagine that things like capitalism and socialism are opposite extremes that share no middle ground. For me the salient question is this. Will the world manage, like some of the examples at the end of the book, to turn away from this type of shock-based free market exploitation, or will new ways of implementing it ruin the hope for billions of average people around the world?good attempt to make sense out of something that can seem confusing.

0307460444|2.0|First saw this book at a friend's and since my teen daughter wanted cupcakes instead of a cake for her b-day party, decided to get a copy for myself. Tried 5 recipes: Red Velvet, Applesauce-Spice, Streusel, Peanut Butter Filled Chocolate and the Cookies and Cream. Followed all recipes to the letter and was disappointed with how most of them turned out. Were these ever tested? These are so heavily laden with butter that when they cool, the cupcake papers are soaked with grease! Doesn't make for a nice presentation for your guests! The Red Velvet recipe photo must have had some PhotoShop touch ups because their frosting is white.  Mine turned pink as I was frosting the cupcakes due to all the red food coloring in the batter!  The PB Filled Chocolate were the biggest disappointment. Recipe says it makes 12, so I used the standard 12 cupcake pan. During baking, the filling & batter oozed up & over the cups and made 1 large mess on top of the entire pan! There ended up being no filling inside and the cupacke itself was rather dry.<br />The Streusel cupcakes were tasty - like a coffeecake - but also had greasy bottoms. And the recipe for the streusel itself made 2x what was needed. The Applesauce-Spice were also good. Best of the bunch were the Cookies & Cream - I'd definitely make these again. Even though the book has a lot of creative decorating ideas and the illustrations are beautiful, I'm quite disappointed with the recipes. I expected a better product.
0061914177|5.0|A fantastic book that will have you wanting to jump on your passion in the first 15 pages.  That's what happened to me.  It is easy to get behind Gary.  He comes across as a genuine and authentic.  Contrary to other authors who want to lead you to their site or offer by putting in little codes and such, Gary more than once writes, \\"if you want to know more about X, email me.\\"    I did and he answered.  He loves people and you will most likely love him because you will be energized by this book.      Work is what you do when you don't follow your passion. Life is what you live when you do.  He gives you the best gift anyone can get - hope.  He gives you hope through his story of how he used the tools that allowed him to live his passion.    150 pages may seem like few but I believe the best books are short. No fluff, just filler.    Buy it.
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|Seeing the plans for the sequel, from the old animation studio storyboards, was rather fun. But the biggest thing going on here is the high definition recording of Snow White. It looks good. Really good. With animation, upgrading to high def seems to be pretty smooth. You fill in the data and there's not a lot of artistry needed. The colors are saturated, movement is smooth, and the audio is clear and noise-free. Until the next technology, this is the definitive Snow White.
B0000633T6|5.0|Having entered the CIA at about the age of 40 (Three Days of the Condor),  Robert Redford retires from it  in this film made, appropriately enough,  when he was about age 65. While a lesser film,  it is still worth seeing the now senior actor go through his paces. He is tough, chillingly focused on the target, and prepared to do whatever it takes to get that job done. Inside, however, we do find a spark of professional loyalty. He won't  let one of his \\"boys\\"  get the short end of the stick just because their  bosses are willing to make the expedient choice.  There is a fair amount of action but the essence of the story lies in the personality of Redford's character,  that of his protege,  Brad Pitt.,  and the relationship between them. No question that it was up to Redford, the actor, to make or break the film. He came through in style providing the anchor for everything else that goes on. Brad Pitt does a good job as the youngster, while the others carry through with some style in the supporting roles.  There is no doubt that this is fiction,  a story with conflicts among characters which give it substance and interest.  I feel  no need to treat it as other than making a film that people would come to see. You may see some sort of message in it; so be it. Either viewpoint can spend an interesting evening watching the DVD monitor with this one playing
0882709194|1.0|Darwin's Origin of Species is, of course, an icon of scientific writing. It is eminently readable and accessible to nonscientists and should be read by everyone. This edition though, the \\"150th Anniversary Edition\\" is an intentional Trojan horse published exclusively to serve as a vehicle for Ray Comfort's 50 page introduction. Comfort is a young-earth creationist and rejects Darwin's theory wholesale. Every reader of this review should contact Amazon and ask them to differentiate this edition of \\"Origin\\" from legitimate republications of this epic work. Comfort's 50 page intro is an embarrassing affront to scientific honesty and integrity. Anybody who has followed his antics on the internet knows not to take him seriously, but by attaching his name and his screed to Darwin's work, and then having Amazon market it as though it's a legitimate complement to this volume, is abhorrent.

B0000047CW|5.0|I first acquired this wonderful album on LP in the early 1970s. It cost 99 cents. It had a bullethole in the corner. Translation for young people: this means it had been remaindered, was being sold cheap, and the hole marked it as unreturnable. It soon turned into one of my favorite albums, and has never not been, since then. It would certainly be one of the 10 albums I'd want with me if marooned on a desert island (assuming the island had electricity.) I was so moved by it that, on my only trip to Rio, I bought another copy, as it seemed like the natural thing to do to own one that actually came from Brazil. No bullethole in this one. I later bought it again on CD. It never fails to make me feel good. Not only isn't there a bad song on it, there isn't a song on it that is less than great.<br /><br />Reading some of the other reviews here, I learned something. Didn't know Charlie Byrd was the leader in its conception, being inspired by the Brazilian sound after a state-sponsored trip there during the Kennedy Administration. I always assumed Stan Getz was. No matter.<br /><br />This album distinguishes itself: of all jazz albums that have come out since albums were invented in the 1950s, this is the single best one from a pop standpoint - brilliant, talented jazz that at the same time could be played on a pop station, an old standards station, a beautiful music station, a top 40 station, you name it. Jazz you could give to Grandma to listen to. The pop melodies are listenable, whistleable and unforgettable; the solos are sharp and wonderful, not a bad note in them.<br /><br />This is what jazz was meant to be: a popular music, music you could dance to, but with brilliant improvisation in it that didn't take away from the song around it.
0385340990|5.0|I loved this book, I didn't want it to end.  After it was over I kept thinking I wanted to stop what I was doing and read more of it!  Now it did have a very satisfactory conclusion mind you, I was just so attached to all the characters they felt like friends I wanted to go see again.  My favorite part was the ending, I loved the way she presented it.<br /><br />It is a very easy read that I would recommend for teenagers and above.  I am sad we won't see any more works by this author as she has passed away.
B002SJIO5E|5.0|District 9 makes no apologies for being a straight-forward heavy-handed allegory for South African apartheid, hence the probability of a malfunctioning extraterrestrial mothership that just so happens to appear hovering in the skies over Johannesburg of all places on Earth and marooning a non-human race of aliens which are quickly given the derogatory slur \\"Prawn\\" because of their resemblance in appearance to our planet's indigenous crustaceans and are quickly \\"relocated\\" from District 9's shantytowns and slums as history begins to inevitably repeat itself. The film starts off as a mockumentary with realistic brilliance and abruptly shifts gears toward a conventional plot-driven science fiction story that recalls sociological themes of racial prejudice explored in past science fiction films like [[ASIN:B000059HAD Alien Nation]] and [[ASIN:B000059HAC Enemy Mine]]. There really aren't any likable humans in this film at all, not even the \\"anti-hero\\" Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley) who comes off as a complete bureaucratic tool only interested in (literally) saving his own skin... and that's really the whole point, isn't it? That from the alien's point-of-view their impression of the human race is one of a predominately vile, greedy, despicably self-serving species whose ulterior motive is profiting from the knowledge and technological \\"acquisitions\\" that contact with an advanced alien race might bring us and the consequences when first contact goes horribly awry and Director Neill Blomkamp explores these shameful and seemingly unredemptive human character flaws with profound existential brilliance.<br /><br />The \\"Prawns\\" are the most \\"Alien\\" looking aliens in cinema this side of H.R. Giger's Alien or Stan Winston's Predator and refreshingly features some of the best use of seamlessly integrated CGI seen in cinema in recent years. The more inhuman they appear only reinforces our irrational fears and anxieties to their seemingly non-hostile intentions and our tendencies towards racial animosity. They communicate to us only through a strange audible clicking sound that constitutes their linguistic structure similar to the native South African Bantu and the apparent semantic language differences, cultural customs and communication barriers rapidly deteriorate any hope for peaceful coexistence between our species. For example, the Prawns don't understand legal jargon like \\"eviction\\" making their ignorance to our common laws easy targets for bureaucratic exploitation and authoritarian subjugation.<br /><br />It would be interesting to see if the Prawn who identifies himself only as Christopher Johnson would keep his promise to Wikus. After all the deplorable things we did to his kind though why should he? Perhaps that is what ultimately separates them from us and in spite of his race being atrociously segregated, brutally tortured and inhumanely experimented on comes back in three years to District 10 to free his people and help poor Wikus out of moral sympathy and compassion, universal traits that are seemingly lost upon the native human inhabitants of this planet.wards racial animosity.

B001GCUNW6|5.0|I think 3D is a waste of money and it gives me a headache.  Its even worse that you have to wear special eyeglasses to watch it at home (one more thing to lose AND a headache).

It is so convenient to transfer movies my kid like to my iPod to play through my cars entertainment system.  No more discs to drag around, plus I get the nice HD version to play at home.  I will never purchase a 3D version of  movie, and I've gotten to the point where I won't purchase a video doesn't come with a digital download.
B0012DZ356|5.0|I listened to the fine audio version of this and recommend it highly. Munro has the ability to take plots which if described mechanically, as one reviewer did, can sound formulaic (one could say the same of Shakespeare) but never read that way. Sometimes we want to know more, as her characters do, but Munro recognizes the falsity in that. A less talented writer would have made Juliet's story into a tragic melodrama but instead she gives us a haunting portrayal of the consequences of Juliet's character and her choices. Great fiction doesn't always give us what we think we want, but instead helps us understand more fully the challenges of living. She is as deserving of a Nobel prize as any living writer in english. The first story, the title story, was in some ways the weakest. It is  pretty good, but if you are a little uncertain after reading it, keep going.    One of the reviewers seems to think that Munro is southern, which, of course, she is not.

All albums have been unique and great listens for me. Even though I feel nothing can touch Mutter (Personal Opinion), Liebe Ist Fu Alle Da comes in very very close. There is not one bad song in this album. And the extra five songs on the second disk made the wait so much worth it. I hope they tour the states or at least Mexico City.

And song #3, ALice,\\" is astounding for its leslie'd bass (leslie'd bass, now!) intro and underpinning.

But STILL:  the ALL TIME #1 'IN YOUR FACE' \\"lead guitar\\" solo is presented here by Mr. Bender on the album's first - incandescent! - track, \\"The Golden Age Of Rock And Roll.\\" STONES-rock and roll...but then...the guitar solo:  and ARiel eschews the current guitar cliches, and presents a - can I say it, Amazon? - masturbatory \\"solo\\" of false notes and completely gratuitous finger exercise. - BRILLIANT!  For a band abot 30 minutes to being - PFFT! - completely gone, \\"The Hoople\\" is simply BRILLIANT.  And despite my falling out with Ian Hunter recently, over his \\"post-Ronno\\" output, he shone like a July 4th firecracker here.

Especially some of his most recent CDs. His grizzled, weary, cigarette-laden voice suits later material like \\"Modern Times\\" and \\"Love & Theft\\" very well. \\"Christmas In The Heart,\\" however, sounds like a 68-year-old emphysemic wheezing his way through a winter wonderland, leaving a trail of phlegm in the snow behind him. It's enough to make the most devout Christian consider atheism.     Giving this two-stars. One for each of Bob's tar-filled lungs.    Love ya, Bob. Just not this CD.

1594488878|5.0|The characters are fleshed out (whether they are likeable or not) and real. Having met several obessive, one dimensional, warm and fuzzy as a lump of coal Duncans (and perhaps even dated a couple) Annie 's reactions to her situation was realistic to me. Although not a bungee jumper in life, Annie does stretch and go out of her comfort zone to find life is not as bland and dreary as it previously seemed.  Tucker, the has-been moderately successful songerwriter and singer, who has been a recluse from not only the world, but his own children (sired by a number of wives/girlfriends)and has hidden away from his own emotions and talent for the last 20 years inspired a small, internet cult following (who really need to get a life!). Annie's bleak life and Tucker's massive inertia break at the end of the story.  Really good read!  Also recommend by Nick Hornsby: [[ASIN:0575066598 About a Boy]] and [[ASIN:0140293442 Fever Pitch]]
B0010YPTGU|5.0|An absolute must for your musical collection. The venue, cinematography and artists and their performances combine to make this an unforgettably enjoyable CD/DVD.
0060512806|4.0|Although I'm a computer engineer the part of the book that I found most interesting was the historical part. Took a real interest in it and found myself reading a lot of Wikipedia articles about many of the historical figures presented in this book. Almost all of these are present in the WWII storyline.    The modern-day storyline revolves mostly around cryptography, business plans, various intrigues some of which you might like, some of which might put you off. I found the modern-day story line not so interesting as the WWII one but mostly because the former is shaped by the latter. The plot twists only become clear towards the last third of the book and that's when the action really catches you.    Neal Stephenson uses a very \\"unusual\\" language. I am not a native English speaker so by \\"unusual\\" I mean somewhat hard to follow but not necessarily unenjoyable. I read most of this book with an English dictionary sitting right next to me and it was pretty worn out by the time I finished. So beware if you do not master the English language.    Even if it is a long and not an easy book to read I truly recommend it. Don't be discouraged by a slow start. Subjects like WWII history, cryptography (even for people who have no idea what this means), mining :), data heavens, financial uses of berried gold together with some great characters and great story telling (especially the WWII storyline) make this book a must read.
B002SJIO54|5.0|[...]  There's the IMDB review score, currently 8.4.    The movie is excellent, and I'm sure most people are smart enough not to listen to bad reviews that seem written by a 10 year old.    To everyone else, this is nothing like Independence Day, it is not a Hollywood by the numbers film, if you're only in it for the 'splosions(though it does have some awesome action sequences) don't see/buy this movie.
B0029O08WA|5.0|This CD is definitely a little more mellow than the Twilight Soundtrack.  Lots of interesting bands!  If you have read the book (and I hope you have) the CD fits the mood set in the book, a little bit darker, a lot more complicated, and more involved. Can't wait to see the movie!!!

0786868724|5.0|Have a Little Faith is a wonderful story of Mitch Albom and his rabbi and a long journey they shared as the rabbi was preparing to die. Albom is a terrific storyteller and is transparent about his own doubts regarding his faith and death. Very interesting read that inspires you to think about your own life and faith, even if you don't have any religious faith. If you do have a strong faith, this will inspire you to do something with that faith.  Mitch Albom starts and runs non-profit organizations; do you or I?  If faith without works is dead, he is at least showing us what demonstrating faith might look like.<br /><br />Great gift and great read for a book club group. A+++++++++ (he is also a terrific speaker in person and is touring; if you get a chance to see him, do it)
B000O77SOK|5.0|The Practice is one of the best, thought-provoking, intelligently-written shows on TV with brilliant acting to boot! This is the show that had made me love everything legal. Given the show's excellent caliber and accolades, its successful eight-year run, the exponentially insistent demand from the devotees and the fact that it'd been 2 long years since volume 1 had been released, I'm profoundly incredulous and frustrated as to why the remaining seasons aren't yet out on DVD.    Virtually every single show is out on DVD (and some of these shows aren't as brilliant as The Practice), save for this! It's rumored that the music rights is attributable to the protracted delay but nevertheless it shouldn't take THIS L O N G! All of Boston Legal's five seasons (my other favorite show that's secondary to The Practice) are available on DVD even though it is The Practice's successor, therefore the bone of contention cannot be the music rights.    Whatever it may be, I along with a legion of die-hard fans are incredibly TIRED of waiting!! I need my court-room drama fix that only The Practice can satiate (well, that and to stare into Dylan McDermott's baby blues). PLEASE release the remaining seasons of this exceptionally magnificent and addictive show and don't make us wait till 2010 for the long-awaited volume 2 and another ten years for the rest of the seasons! The wait has been long enough.      Update:     I can't believe it's been a year and a half since I've written my review and STILL the remaining seasons are a no-show! Wth! Fox would witness a significant boost in sales if they just released it! Fox is the worst studio ever! They're notorious for cancelling good shows so why should THIS come as any surprise. Every time I go to the video store, I see crappy series being released, not to mention FULL series release, and stellar shows like The Practice, The Nanny and Just Shoot me to name few have not yet been fully released and waves of annoyance and disgust would roll over me. Shame on you Fox for not releasing this classic! You have disappointed and repulsed a legion of fans!

B0011N1WE8|4.0|I bought this movie because our 17 year old son recommended it.  He watched it at a friend's home and said it was good enough to buy.  My husband and I liked it very much.  It is a make-believe magical story set in our contemporary world.  It had good humor, no bad language except for 3-4 less offensive swear words, no immorality shown and it also showed human behavior at its worst and best.  I especially liked the three leads:  Penelope, the young man she eventually dates and marries, and Penelope's mother.  All fine actors.

0061914177|3.0|OK, I owe Gary this review after saying I was disappointed on Twitter.  The irony is that he replied to me right away (get to that later).    Let me preface by saying that a coworker showed me a video of Gary speaking at a conference and I was immediately blown away.  The guy has a style that I can appreciate.  No nonsense, a bit caustic, bombastic, confident, and funny.  I related to it and have since followed Gary.  I'm a fan.  Watch him on UStream quite a bit and appreciate how he conducts business and uses social media.  Was excited to see him launch Cinderella wine and picked up 3 bottles of the first offer (wife glare stopped that trend in it's tracks!).      Gary is worth listening to.  Without a doubt.  He's worth following.  He's worth watching.  He's worth grabbing 5 minutes of his time if you ever see him.      So...the book.      When I got it my immediate thought was \\"Damn.  This thing is thin!\\".  It felt like a kids book or some fluff book by some motivational speaker.  My expectation - that was stoked by a phenomenal marketing plan - for this book was pretty high.  I immediately put down Guy Kawasaki's \\"Reality Check\\" that I picked up in a local bookstore and dove right in.      I enjoyed the storytelling and hearing about how Gary got where he is.  At some point in the book Gary mentions how he knows his strength isn't writing so he partnered with someone and dictated the whole thing.  It showed.  The book didn't \\"feel Gary\\".  The more I read the more I wished he had serialized a bunch of videos and sold a DVD of him talking about everything that was written.  It all just seemed to beg the question of why you'd write a book if writing is not your passion and core strength.      I think it was always going to be a tough thing to pull off, this book deal.  Gary's message translates really well via video, hence the success of his keynotes and WLTV.  It just didn't come across in writing.      Is there value in buying and reading this book?  Absolutely.Would I recommend someone drop a ten spot on it?  Yep.      Did it live up to my expectations?  Sadly, no.      I don't like the feeling that some people are just tossing kudos Gary's way because it's the thing to do.  That's not \\"being real\\" at all.  Call it like you see it.  If you are super hyped up about it and loved it, that's one thing.  Some of the other stuff just looks like bandwagonism.      I know Gary and Vayner Media are disappointed to get reviews like this or to have disappointment.  You know what?  There's no disappointment like a reader not getting what they thought they would from a book.      I hope this will be taken in the spirit it is intended and the next book is one I'll be raving over.  I really do.      I mentioned earlier the irony of Gary having responded to my tweet about how I was disappointed in the read of the book.  That's the point!  You can learn much more by watching Gary in action than by reading about it.  I suppose if you just wanted to buy a copy or three to support someone you like, that's fine.  Not what I'm into books for and certainly not the intent of publishing one.    It's not you, Gary.  It's the book.  ;-)

B0025KVLTW|5.0|Magical Mystery Tour is one Beatles record that is too often passed over.  It was released right in between Sgt. Pepper and the white album, and it was the soundtrack to a TV movie (which I've never seen, but I hear it's not that great).  Sandwiched between two masterpieces, it's easy to overlook Magical Mystery Tour, but that's a mistake.    This is a record full of great songs with some incredible arrangements.  Side one has a lot of fun little songs - Magical Mystery Tour, Your Mother Should Know, Flying.  But it also gets pretty trippy, in that special Beatle way.  Songs like Blue Jay Way are disorienting and completely engrossing at the same time.  And of course, Fool on the Hill and I Am the Walrus are unforgettable.      The second side is where the album really shines.  These songs weren't part of the soundtrack, but were singles released in the UK in 1967, and collected here for the American release.  These are some of the Beatles' best songs, period.  They're arranged beautifully, with plenty of strings, horns, and psychedelic sound effects.  Strawberry Fields and Penny Lane show off the Beatles' (and George Martin's) skills at their absolute peak.  And Baby, You're a Rich Man is a really, really undderrated song - I'd love to hear Prince do a cover!    The new remaster really brings them to life.  I've bought 6 of the Beatles remasters, and of those half dozen, this is the one that benefits the most from the improved sound quality.  You can hear instruments that were previously buried.  The strings and horns have a new clarity.  Paul's bass and especially Ringo's drums have a new punch to them - I never appreciated Ringo so much until I heard these remasters.      This album doesn't have the cohesiveness of Revolver or Sgt. Pepper or Abbey Road, because it wasn't originally conceived as a full-length album.  But each song is a masterpiece in its own right, and the album is one that I'll be listening to a lot more in the coming months.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|Our stroller does not have a cup holder or any type of compartment on it to store anything besides the basket.  We needed something for our week long trip to Disney World with our 2 year old.  This was great!  It held water bottles, cans, and 20 oz cups very well.  We could also get 32 oz cups in it relatively easily by stretching the elastic a little.  The zipper compartment is small, but it would hold a couple of little things.  The middle compartment between the cup holders would hold both by camera and my phone.  I highly recommend this!!
B002BSHXJA|1.0|When The Beatles were remasterd and were available in 2 box sets, one stereo and the other mono, I was quite hyped.  I noticed that I could buy the stereo remastered CD's individually. So I bought a couple.  I was impresssed with the improvement in sound and bought some more.  I was going to buy the Mono set, but ended up buying the complete stereo set over a few weeks.  I'd like the Mono set, but I'm not made out of money.  I'd be tempted to buy the mono set individually, but alas, this is not to be.  Rats.  Over the next year or so, I'd have the entire mono set.  But I'm going to give it a miss.  Pity.    A good capitalist would sell everything individually--both Mono and Stereo.  I will not buy the mono box.  I already ended up with the stereo box after buying one and then another until I had them all.  I did buy Beatles Rock Band--the whole thing for my kids at xmas.  I have oodles of Beatles on vinyl, cassette, and 8-track.  I've got a couple of the movies.  I have some of the music books.  I'm a big fan.  So why can't I buy the mono box individually.  I'm ready to swear allegience to The Rolling Stones.  Beatles be damned.
0060935464|4.0|Layne Gable  Block 3    \\"Shoot all the blue jays you like if you can hit `em, but remember it's a sin to kill a mockingbird.\\" To Kill a Mockingbird takes place in a town called Maycomb in the 1930's. It is a book about two children trying to grow up in an extremely racist town. At a young age their troubles are somewhat childish, but as they grow up they learn what real fear, courage, and prejudice is. First, people should read this book because it teaches a strong life lesson. It shows that everyone deserves to be treated the same no matter what they are. Second, people should read this book because everybody can relate to the events in it. Everybody has gone through growing up and leaning things that you never knew existed. Lastly, people should read this book because it keeps the readers attention the entire time. I will admit that the first twelve chapters are a little slow but one the reader gets further into the story it is almost like you cant put the book down. In conclusion, To Kill a Mockingbird takes place in a small town in the 1930's.  Everybody should read this book for countless reasons. It will keep the readers attention the whole way through. :)
B0017SXHR2|1.0|This is a wonderful movie, one of Hitchcock's best if you like vintage B&W flicks. The acting is superb, and it has an ample share of Hitchcockian humor.    But this particular version is the WORST digitization of a move I have ever seen. The images are muddy at best, and there is obvious and annoying digital noise visible throughout the movie.    By all means, buy the movie.    But don't buy this dog by Triad.
1582701709|5.0|Daytona Moore      The Secret    Did you ever want something in life that you thought you could never get? Well if you read the book, The Secret your bound to get whatever you want! The book will teach you how and what to do to make whatever you want come true. In this book you will meet a lot of scientists, teachers, and even people from off the streets to share their stories. Most of the book shows you things you can do to make your life better. For instance it teaches you how to stay in shape without having to exercise! However, the best part is this book is made for anyone to read. People should read this because it helps you get through life easier, gets you to love yourself for who you are, and teaches you to not let anything or anyone ever bring you down. The Secret was a very fast read to me simply because I just couldn't seem to put it down. In conclusion, I think this book would interest anyone because it helps you get through life in a more positive way, makes you love yourself for who you are, and won't let anyone ever bring you down. I think all people should read this book because than everyone would be happy and the world would be a much better place.

B000071K5L|4.0|Hans Shollenberger  Block 3  Amazon Book Review  To Kill a Mockingbird      What is the significance of the Title?     To Kill A Mockingbird takes place in Maycomb County located in southern Alabama. It is about these two kids named Jem and Scout whose lives are greatly affected by racism in their town. It all starts when their father Atticus who is a lawyer goes to defend a black man in court accused of rape.    One reason why I recommend this book is because it has a lot of mysteries and secrets that make you think \\"is that a coincidence or did the author mean for that to be that way\\". An example would be how Jem, Scout and Atticus's last name is Finch when a finch is a peaceful little bird. It makes you wonder whether the author just came up with that or whether it is supposed to tie in with the mockingbird theme. Another reason why I recommend this book is because it shows you what times were like back then with racism and how the blacks were treated. From reading this you learn that if you were black all it took to get thrown in jail or killed was a white persons lie. The only thing I didn't like about this book was that it started out slow and was a long read due to the number of pages and the small print.    Overall this book causes you to read to understand the mysteries that it held within its pages. It also teaches you a good lesson on hoe America was with racism and how poorly blacks were treated.
B000784WMW|5.0|This BBC adaptation, over 25 years old now, is often scorned for its relatively low production values; \\"bad soap opera\\" has become the go-to put down for those thumbing their noses at humble, made-for-TV '83. The label is applied with casual disdain, with the smug confidence that everyone will agree. If all those bad soaps were even half as good, I'm very sorry now to have missed so much afternoon television. I fell hard for this version (superb and very faithful to the book) long ago, and still prefer it to any other; it inspired me to read \\"Jane Eyre\\" in earnest. Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke, both phenomenal, are Rochester and Jane--just as I envisioned them. They could have delivered their lines on a bare stage and have wowed me just the same. I'm enchanted, mesmerized, moved as if for the first time--no matter how many times I watch. For me, it's all about the performances; and the undiluted Brontë dialogue is a huge plus.      Much has been said of physical appearance in reviews here and elsewhere, some remarks none too flattering. A sampling: too handsome, too tall, too skinny / too plain, too short, too plump, too old--and I've seen worse. A different complaint, very common, is \\"no chemistry.\\" I'm baffled when I come across comments like this: if these two had generated any more heat, conveyed any more repressed longing, my screen might incinerate--and me with it! I adore the way they look together, want them in each other's arms every moment they're not. I love Clarke's finely-drawn characterization, greatly admire her performance. I'm not alone; Clarke has been highly praised by a great many. She conducts herself in a manner befitting Jane's station, so much lower than that of her employer. She never forgets \\"...the wider ocean--wealth, caste, custom...\\" that lies between them. She makes me feel Jane's \\"acute distress...the vehemence of emotion...struggling for full sway.\\" An equal number strongly disagree; she's also been roundly condemned for her representation, slapped with \\"unemotional\\" and \\"wooden\\" over and over. I feel that Jane's passionate love for Rochester--her grief at the prospect of leaving him--is laid bare during the proposal scene; Clarke absolutely convinces me, stirs me without histrionics. We're all very different, though; my \\"perfect Jane\\" and my \\"dream Rochester\\" most likely won't be yours. Watch clips--particularly those of scenes most important to you--then decide if a rental (or a purchase) might be worthwhile. Thankfully, there's a Rochester and a Jane for very nearly everyone now.    Clarke is plainly styled, yes--she is portraying the plainest of heroines, after all. But the simple updo and quaint dresses can't dim her glow: she's \\"a beauty in my eyes.\\" I've read she had trained as a ballet dancer; this is evident in her excellent posture and graceful movements. I love the quiet dignity, the refined quality of her voice. She has AMAZING EYES--intelligent and soulful--and is capable of speaking with them alone. Watch her hands, too; they say so much--and both she and Dalton use breathing very effectively. Clarke's lovely face is incredibly mobile, registering a wide range of emotions equally well. She's a refined, self-possessed, perceptive and compassionate Jane--and an assertive, excitable, determined, warm, and tender one. And she's abundantly passionate--you have only to watch her closely... There is so much SINCERITY in her love for Rochester. You feel that she understands him, that his broken heart is in good hands--she's his angel. She's playful, too--his elf--and even possesses the \\"dimpled cheek.\\" She is quite short, as she should be for the role. Brontë wrote, \\"--being so much lower of stature than he, I served both for his prop and guide.\\" The sight of her--tucked under Dalton's chin, wrapped snugly in his arms--never fails to thrill me. She is absolutely adorable (and 18 enough for me) when still in her nightcap and robe, listening while her seductive master puts his \\"case\\" to her, tells her he has \\"found the being.\\" I vividly recall her anxious face when, in asking Mr. Rochester for leave, she gathers the courage to inquire if he is shortly to be married. When he answers, \\"Yes; what then?\\" she looks fatally wounded, but struggles valiantly to regain her composure--heartwrenching! The devastation rocking her can be seen and felt when she bids him farewell \\"for the present,\\" and the oh so sweet sexual tension reaches a new level of intensity: white hot! (Dalton's farewell \\"for the present,\\" delivered so very meaningfully, and the desire he expresses for a warmer good-bye, leave me weak-kneed for hours...) And Clarke's teary confession of love under the chestnut tree is EXQUISITE. Clarke has NO EQUAL as Jane, and her performance will not be outdone.     I find Brontë's description of Rochester appealing, save for, \\"--his unusual breadth of chest, disproportionate almost to his length of limb.\\" That adjective--disproportionate--disappointed somehow, even when I read it as a young person. Dalton's tall, lean, beautifully proportioned Rochester suits me perfectly--he's beyond splendid in the period garb. Yes, he's UNDENIABLY GORGEOUS, but so DARKLY, INTENSELY MASCULINE--\\"all energy, decision, will\\"--I can forgive his considerable male beauty: my gaze rests on his perfectly sculpted features with guiltless pleasure. Dalton is almost god-like as Rochester, a force to be reckoned with; he's ruined me for all the others. Readers of the book will remember Rochester makes a number of confessions in Chapter 27. He tells Jane he returned to England \\"...rid of all mistresses--in a harsh, bitter frame of mind...corroded with disappointment, sourly disposed against all men, and especially against all womankind...\\" He assures her \\"It was not [his] original intention to deceive...\\" and explains \\"[he] was an intellectual epicure, and wished to prolong the gratification of making...[her] acquaintance.\\" Dalton gets Rochester exactly right--not an easy thing--and he plays his dangerous game expertly. A lesser woman might surrender without a struggle. But Jane presents something of a challenge, resolved as she is to obey him only in \\"all that is right,\\" so Rochester must take extreme measures to excite her jealousy. Dalton is endlessly irresistible, heartstoppingly sexy, deliciously predatory--never more potently seductive than when testing, teasing and tempting Clarke's lonely little love starved Jane. Observe his eyes as they follow her every move--as she takes up a candle preparatory to playing a tune and, later, as she approaches shyly when asked to join him on the library sofa. He can be just as tender, too: he broke my heart as the vulnerable lover kneeling at her side--begging her to stay. Dalton understands the extraordinary affection Rochester feels for Jane, and utters all those wonderful endearments--\\"my pet lamb,\\" \\"my pale little elf,\\" \\"my fairy,\\" etc.--with a naturalness and a depth of feeling I could not have imagined possible. And that incomparable voice!--very like a caress--I sometimes close my eyes in order to enjoy it alone. Dalton brings the tormented figure to life--in all his complexity--like no one else can ever even hope to: HE'S THAT GOOD. To watch his bitter and despairing but still hopeful Rochester fall for little Jane is to witness a rare magic that won't be repeated. The emotion he brings to the proposal scene--from start to finish--is ASTONISHING IN ITS POWER, and UNFORGETTABLE.    Thornfield has become almost a real place for me, and Rochester and Jane living, breathing lovers--thanks to this treasure.

That is exactly what happened to Clay Jenson. He decided to listen to them and they ended up being made by his dead classmate, Hannah Baker. Her voice tells Clay that he is on the tapes and is one of the reasons she committed suicide. Clay is instructed by the tapes to go around the town and visit the places Hannah is talking about in the tapes. There are thirteen different people who are responsible for Hannah's death. The interesting story is all about the tapes and how each person did something that they never thought would lead to Hannah's death. You should read this book because it is extremely interesting to read how just a few mean jokes and gossip and lead to a horrible tragedy. Most of the thirteen people did not know the outcome of their games and teasing. Also, this book is very fascinating because as Clay makes his way around the town you can imagine Hannah there and talking to him about why she killed herself. Hannah tells him to go to the places so he can see where all of the bad things went wrong in her life. Finally, you should read this book because it is very informative to all of the warning signs of suicide. As Clay is listening to the tapes he realized how oblivious he was to all of the warnings. This book can help you see the symptoms before there is an action that cannot be undone. In conclusion, you should read this book because it is wonderfully absorbing, detailed, and informative.

0671027344|4.0|This book was incredibly interesting to read. So interesting, in fact, I read it twice. The character, Charlie is very honest, as said in the book by his friend, and has a very neat way of writing. It makes the book that more interesting. The whole way of how the book was written as letters were very neat. What I liked a lot about this book is that the Charlie character never had an absolutley terrible downspiral. Unless you consider the hospital visit at the end a absolutley horrible downspiral, Charlie did out just fine. I thought this book was very refreshing and simple and sweet. The character Charlie was interesting and innocent. His friends were a lot different from him, making his relationship with them very interesting. What else I liked about this book is how Charlie never had any bad feelings about anyone. There was not any generic antagonist that you always see in books. There was of course, an antagoinst somewhere. But it was very well hidden. The relationships Charlie has with all the other characters in the book are very quirky and unique. Overall, this book is very refreshing and somewhat happy although its dealing with drugs. I will give it a 9/10.    -T.G.SHAW
0307269981|5.0|This was a great book. I can hardly wait for the final book in the trilogy which isn't due out until March of 2010. It's a shame the author died, I think he has written the best suspense/mystery books I've read in ages.
0694003611|2.0|My son LOVES books but has no interest in this book - NONE.  I probably read 30+ books a day to him.  At 12 months he can sit through average length books (e.g. Brown Bear Brown Bear, What Do You See?) and some longer length books (e.g. Chicka Chicka Boom Boom - his favorite).  He won't even sit through the first half of this book and it's relatively short.  I don't understand what people see in this book.  The black & white pages are very dull and the objects that are mentioned in the book are so small I have to look for them.  Neither the illustrations nor the wording hold a young child's attention.  There are so many other nighttime books that are more appealing to young children.  Save your money and space on your bookshelf.
B001XJEKGC|4.0|Lot of great songs but not thrilled with all of it.  Good quality sound.
B000002TQV|5.0|Like someone else said in a review, this would be the album to give someone who had never listened to Radiohead. It is a good introduction, and it gets the listener ready to hear OK Computer.    OK Computer is a better album than this one from a technical and artistic standpoint, but this one has stronger melodies for those listeners who want a more \\"accessible\\" album.     I disagree strongly with people who say that Radiohead got too \\"weird\\" after this album, but I think that thinking is to be expected when one considers that this album is so well made, with perfectly processed guitar sounds, pretty vocals, keyboards kept neatly tucked in the background, and classic song structures throughout. What people who take the time will hear though, is that the same strong melodies, lyrics, and interesting harmonies that make this a classic are present on every Radiohead album, and sometimes even more so on the \\"weird\\" ones. The difference now is that Radiohead has decided to widen its pallette with keyboards, strings, effects, etc. The guitars, bass, and drums are still there, though, and so are the strong melodies and emotions behind them, so I don't see what all of the fuss is about. Radiohead is one of the few modern bands who has talent even somewhat comparable to the bands of the 60s and 70s, so why not grant them the same freedom to explore new territory?    One thing that does bother me about this album is that the band should play more songs from it live.
B002KDUDG6|4.0|\\"Crazy Love\\" is another solid, professional, joyous, fun group of songs Michael Buble and his producers have assembled as a follow up to \\"Call Me Irresponsible,\\" which was also just as solid and joyous. The good songs here are plentiful with tight, terrific orchestrations and harmonies: a terrific cover of \\"Crazy Love,\\" by Van Morrison, the title track, which also reminds you of how truly great Mr. Morrison is; a catchy and fun new song, \\"Haven't Met You Yet\\" (though not nearly as good as \\"Home,\\" still his best, but comparable to \\"Everything\\") and even \\"Hold On,\\" another of his inspirational songs; the classic \\"All of Me,\\" which is uniquely suited to Buble's gifts as a vocalist in the Sinatra style; \\"All I Do Is Dream Of You,\\" another classic that Buble supports with solid harmonies; and, finally, hopefully a sign of things to come, \\"Whatever It Takes,\\" by Ron Sexsmith, who duets on the song with Buble.  The last song, a bonus, is where I'd personally like to see Buble go with another CD: great covers of songs by contemporary artists who have a gift for melody.  Just as with his terrific version of \\"Wonderful Tonight\\" on \\"Call Me Irresponsible,\\" Buble adds his great energy and spirit to songs like these and makes them come alive.  He is, without question, without peer right now in blending in so many different styles successfully: standards, pop, rock, jazz, etc. and he does so without cheapening the material.  Anyone who has seen him in concert knows he is the real deal: a strong, supple vocal instrument, good phrasing, moves well, and, for the most part, chooses good material.  A few songs here are rather weak: \\"Georgia on My Mind\\" has been sung FAR better by others; \\"Hearbreak Tonight\\" is OK, but not as good as the Eagles original.  This, like \\"Call Me Irreponsible,\\" is sometimes too much of a good grab bag of songs rather than the thematic story of love and heartbreak Buble said he intended this album to be.  And he still makes too many safe choices  - and sometimes pedestrian ones - instead of taking more risks with edgier songs, which he can certainly do very well. \\"It's Time\\" and the follow-up CD/DVD of his concert in LA are still the highlights of his great career so far - there was both a sincerity and passion in those songs and concert that are sometimes missing here - but you can't bet against him coming up with something even greater in the future. He now has all the tools to make a REAL concept album: with riskier choices, songs and duets with more contemporary artists, and more duets with female vocalists.  \\"Crazy Love\\" is not a great CD, but it is a very good one that grows on you with repeated listenings and has all the style and kick of his earlier CD's - and has songs that add to an already superb gallery of tunes he performs with such energy and spirit in concert. Bubleland is still in business - especially if the sales of this CD are any indication - and one could do worse than listen to some several senstational performances and, at least, some very good ones. \\"Whatever It Takes\\" and \\"Crazy Love\\" are my favorites on this CD because they show off what great skills Buble has when his vocals perfectly match the material and this CD is worth owning just for those two performances alone. \\"Crazy Love\\" is a winner!imes pedestrian ones - instead of taking more risks with edgier songs, which he can certainly do very well. \\"It's Time\\" and the follow-up CD/DVD of his concert in LA are still the highlights of his great career so far - there was both a sincerity and passion in those songs and concert that are sometimes missing here - but you can't bet against him coming up with something even greater in the future.

B001GQACGE|3.0|When you think of a cd or movie that is divided into two discs, you think of a collection of work that is so long, so great, so fullfilling, so varied that you just can't squeeze it into one album.  Not so with \\"I Am . . . Sasha Fierce\\".  What you have here is one [pretty average] album split up into two very short ones.  This annoys me for several reasons:  1) It keeps it from being a cohesive body of work, and instead, each cd feels like a sampler of a new, undiscovered artist peddling his/her demo tape at the car wash because there are only a few songs on it 2) All 11 tracks could have EASILY fit on one disc.  Now I'm no environmentalist, but when I think about how much extra plastic will eventually end up in some landfill because Beyonce wanted to make sure we know the difference between an uptempo song and a ballad, it makes me sad. 3) Because it's on two discs, I can't enjoy all the songs at once.  I have to stop what I'm doing, take out one cd, and put in the next one.  Not so fun when you're at the gym and you have to stop mid-workout to change discs because your music just stopped.    How dumb do record producers think we as an audience are that they think people will be more likely to buy a cd because it's not just by Beyonce, but also by her [wait for it] . . . alter ego!  Oooooo!!!    As for the songs themselves, there are actually a few good ones on both discs.  \\"If I Were a Boy\\" and \\"Halo\\" are both beautiful and poignant ballads.  \\"Sweet Dream\\" and \\"Radio\\" are GREAT songs to dance or work out to.  \\"Diva\\" and \\"Video Phone\\" are just nasty wastes of time. They sound as if Beyonce took a Starbucks break and said \\"Hey, J[ay-Z] - could you make up some beats while I'm gone?\\".  He does, and when she comes back, she just moans out some words that rhyme to go with them and slapped them on the album.    If you have a friend who owns this album, it's worth asking them to burn you a copy, but I wouldn't spend money on it [again].
1932100660|3.0|This a very good book.  Very compelling.  I almost hate to bring up questions.  I'm not a scientist who can argue the validity of the data, but I noticed one particular 'flaw'.      The author makes a big deal out of the Western Reductionist model which he should, definitely!!!  However, doesn't he do the same thing by bringing it all down to one thing - animal protein?  My grandfather and grandmother and their siblings lived on farms in West Virginia.  They worked hard, ate few sweets, but ate ALOT of meat and fat.  They and the siblings who maintained their lifestyle lived well into their eighties, very viably and healthily.  Could it be that more data should have been culled regarding highly refined carbohydrates and sugar overload?  There are brief mentions of the \\"oh, yeah, don't eat sweets either\\" kind, but no data for or against.  And nothing that integrates the whole diet versus animal protein only.  I'm just not convinced by that all possibilities were seriously reviewed (or attempted to be reviewed - can we ever know all possibilities).  What about level of physical exertion?  What about the level of toxins between rural and urban?  Where were the metrics for these in the China Study?     Having said all of that, I am definitely cutting back on meat big time as well as refined carbs, while 'beefing up' healthful, plant-based foods and supplements.  The dilemma is doing so in a culture that is literally saturated in unhealthy food, profit-based medical care, and other detrimental lifestyle options.
0307269981|4.0|If you liked THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO you will love THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE. I did speak with someone who read this book without reading the first book and although they liked it a great deal, I'm sure that they missed a lot of the plot and the ambiance of the story by not having the background on the characters.  THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE is a very solid and readable sequel.  There are some reviewers who thought that the first part of the book didn't add much to the story. I really disagree with them.  The book caught my attention from the beginning and I would highly recommend it.  Apparently, there is a third book left by the author before his death.  As much as I liked the first two books, I'm inclined to feel like I've had enough of the characters and will do some serious thought about encountering them again.
0385504225|1.0|I absolutely loved the DaVinci Code, but this was long, drawn out and almost boring.  The characters were not as personable or worth getting into either.    And I was expecting so much more!    Judy Allen
1400034205|5.0|I have just finished re-reading \\"The Razor's Edge.\\"  This must be my third time around with this novel, over a span of many years.  Yet it continues to fascinate me; sometimes I think I'm still playing \\"catch-up\\" with Maugham. The same goes for \\"The Summing Up\\" and his short stories --- they are so good that they invite re-reading after a decade or so has gone by.<br /><br />\\"The Razor's Edge\\" is a pretty simple story, which might be titled \\"My Encounters with Larry.\\"  Maugham apologizes for this at the outset, and even goes so far as to write in something like \\"the real first person,\\" where the characters address him as \\"Maugham.\\"  The character who attracts the lion's share of attention is a young American named Larry, who was badly shocked during World War I and afterward set out on a search to discover the meaning of life with a private income of $3,000 per year.<br /><br />Put that way, it sounds completely corny --- but, then again, aren't many of us searching for the meaning of life?  We may not have $3,000 a year (quite a bit back then, at least enough to live on) and we may not have the iron backbone of Larry, who is not just \\"dabbling\\" and \\"posing,\\" but is quite capable of spending the entire day reading through William James' \\"Principles of Psychology.\\"<br /><br />But how can you tell a tale like this without making it utterly boring?<br /><br />Maugham's answer to this problem works splendidly.  He surrounds his central character with a cast of extremely vivid characters, none of whom are concerned with searching for the meaning of life --- because they all believe they already KNOW the meaning of life, and are avidly pursuing it.  The amiable snob Templeton devotes his entire life to social climbing, and believes that, after death, he will \\"move in the best circles\\" in Heaven!  After all, Heaven has gradations as well: Seraphim, Cherubim, Archangels and the rest.  The main female character, Isabel, has a hopeless lifelong crush on Larry, but her \\"meaning of life\\" is almost exactly defined as \\"upper-middle-class American prosperity,\\" and she eventually marries Gray Maturin, who is quite sure that the meaning of life is \\"work, money, and a beautiful wife.\\"  These characters and more are thrown into the world of the 1920's, and they all find their lives drastically altered by the character-revealing stock market crash and Depression.  As these characters endlessly pursue their own small ends, Larry continues steadfastly working on the eternal questions of God's existence and the meaning of life.<br /><br />The book is superbly well-written.  I had an excellent teacher at UCLA who told his class that \\"Maugham may not be an 'A' writer, but almost everyone admits that he is the very best of the 'B' writers.\\"  That judgment may have been an understatement.  Whatever else you may say about Somerset Maugham, he wrote well and was a tremendous storyteller.  I am personally convinced that his short stories are overdue for a major revival.<br /><br />In the meantime, if you have any interest in those Big Questions, I can recommend this book to you without reservation.  The resolution is not philosophically or theologically simple --- not by any means.  But it coheres --- it holds together.  And that is no task for a \\"grade-B\\" writer.<br /><br />A terrific book!!ined as \\"upper-middle-class American prosperity,\\" and she eventually marries Gray Maturin, who is quite sure that the meaning of life is \\"work, money, and a beautiful wife.\\"  These characters and more are thrown into the world of the 1920's, and they all find their lives drastically altered by the character-revealing stock market crash and Depression.

0385504225|2.0|I eagerly awaited the arrival of my copy of \\"The Lost Symbol\\" and quickly finished the book I had been reading, in anticipation of a great story. Unfortunately, I am left feeling as though I'm done with Dan Brown books, for good. \\"Da Vinci Code\\" was my first Dan Brown book & also my favorite. \\"Angels and Demons\\" was a good read, but I was slightly disappointed in the monotony of the formula. It was flat out tiresome by the time I finished with \\"The Lost Symbol\\".     Several other reviews discuss the disappointment with the end of the book in some detail... and I fully agree with most assessments & won't repeat the analysis here. Of course, there is a sect of the population that will fall in love with this book BECAUSE of the ending. IMO, the entire premise of this book is a slick attempt by Dan Brown to extend his reach to the audience that had previously opposed his novels. This drastic shift in audience is likely to create even more controversy, publicity & ultimately- more sales.     The 2 star rating (as opposed to 1) was given because the book is a \\"page-turner\\". Although toward the end, the motivation for my page-turning was to bring the misery to an end, and a not reflection of a thrilling plot.
0316069906|5.0|Jonathan Safran Foer's latest book is a must-read for all of us who want to more closely examine the consequence of our food choices and how easy it is to live more compassionately. It's a fun and easy read -- you'll never even realize you read the whole thing in one sitting. I'm definitely getting this book as a gift for my friends.
0441009425|5.0|Ok, I must admit, I am new to reading Sci-Fi books.  I am a hobbyist astronomer though, and nearly obsessed with space.  I purchased this book because I wanted to see how a real astro-physicist would handle the Fermi-Paradox in a fiction form; Reynolds didn't let me down.    Looking at all the reviews of this book, it seems like this a fairly polarizing book.  People either tend to love it or hate it.  I believe most people that dislike this book may do so because the style and way the plot is laid out is a little unorthodox.  I will admit that in the beginning 200 pages, I did find myself rereading quite a bit, and it took me longer to digest all the content.  One thing that Reynolds does, and fairly quickly, is throw all of us readers right into the fire.  There is little explanation of what is happening, and the reader is immersed right from the start and left having to figure out a lot of the details for themselves.  It took me a while to realize this, but this is how Reynolds builds tension and hype in this book - he gives you little chunks here and there, and waits until later to uncover everything, mostly through flashbacks or large revelations.    As a story goes, the plot is just deep enough to keep you turning the pages.  The characters are very human, and very flawed.  While the characters and indeed the central plot are very good, I don't think they are the shining star of this book.  What will really keep you turning the pages is the universe that Reynolds creates.  Reynolds does an amazing job creating the universe, writing history of millions of years of our galaxy.  Reynolds does such a good job of creating a believable future galaxy that I feel like he could stick any characters into it, and I would be more than happy to gobble it up.  I think that is the crux of this book (and the most polarizing part), Reynolds isn't trying to just write a book about Sylveste, Volyova, and Khouri (as good as characters as they are), but he is writing an epic discovery of the Revelation Space universe - and that is the true star.    This is going to go down as one of my favorite novels.  Reynolds ideas are so fresh - and it is nice to see a Space Opera that is not full of wormholes, light sabers, and faster than light travel.  The universe is cold and unforgiving - and the technology in Revelation Space is not so far out of this world to not be one day conceivable.  While this novel took a bit more work to read - it was well worth the effort.
B002K0WBY6|4.0|Essentially I agree with just about everything said in the other rave reviews. Bullock's at her best; ditto Reynolds. Great scenery, hilarious story, good  chemistry and superb support from Steenburgen, Nelson and the incomparable Betty White, who's still stealing every scene she's in at 87.<br /><br />I'm only adding my 2 cents worth to the pile because I'm a bit stunned that so far no one's mentioned the hilarious comic contributions of Oscar Nunez (the gay accountant on \\"The Office\\") as Ramone, the local Sitka shopkeeper and caterer who freelances as a male stripper and a wedding officiant, and the great  character actor Denis O'Hare as the immigration official with the gotcha mentality. This movie is worth the price just for the Reynolds and O'Hare reaction shots alone.  But...<br /><br />For those who don't need a digital copy,  it's not worth the extra 8 bucks just to get the extra extras (a rather mediocre outtakes/goofing off reel, 2 very short deleted scenes and a poorly concocted all-wrong, too-long alternate ending). If I had it to do over I'd have gone for the cheaper single disc version.

B002NXSRX4|2.0|No one is expecting much out of a film like this, you go and watch it for some actions scenes and hot girls in skin tight costumes trying to be [...]. That's fine I get that. Problem is GI Joe is just trying way too hard to be cool, the action scenes are far too over the top and require CGI for almost every single second of them, and you start to wonder why they just didn't render the whole film like it and save a lot of money. Even the dialog comes across as forced, you can tell that the actors are cringing on the inside with each syllable of nonsense they must mutter, even down to squeezing in some of the catch phrases such as \\"knowing is half the battle\\", \\"GO Joe!\\" and \\"Real American hero\\".  If I didn't know any better I would say that this is a live action Team America, finish watching the Paris scene and tell me I'm wrong, I dare you.  At the end of the day the movie does do what is set out to do. A minor distraction that is forgotten quickly, a B-Movie with a budget.
6305692572|4.0|Someone said they showed parts of \\"When a Man Loves a Woman\\" to them in an alcohol program they were in after a DUI arrest. Interesting. From the title it sounds like it is going to be a romance, even a romantic comedy, but it is a serious drama about a man who is married to an alcoholic. Michael Green (Andy Garcia) is a pilot who meets Alice (Meg Ryan) in the Buena Vista Caf&eacute; in Fisherman's Wharf. Actually, it is in what we San Franciscans used to call The Marina. It is the bar where Irish Coffee was invented. If you are ever in San Francisco, try one. Even if it is something for tourists, it is an experience not to be missed. Unless you are an alcoholic and shouldn't drink.<br /><br />Alice Green, for instance, should not have another Irish Coffee at the Buena Vista Caf&eacute;, or Dolce, Hemlock Tavern, Zeitgeist, Holy Cow, Harry Denton's Starlight Room, Martuni's, Endup, The Stud, Specs', Savoy Tivoli, Vesuvio, Kimo's, Bondage a Go-Go, Arrow Bar, Boom Boom Room, Ten 15 Folsom, 330 Ritch, El Rio, Ginger's Trois, Midnight Sun, Bix, Motherlode, The Lexington Club, ELBO Room, and Shotwell's, ever, under any circumstances.<br /><br />-------------------<br />Alice Green: I drink a quart a day. It's vodka so you couldn't smell it.<br />===============================<br /><br />This was a good, serious drama. If you are drinking a quart a day, though, you could smell it, vodka or not. In spite of a few relapses, it was a very realistic depiction of alcoholism. It didn't just have a fake Hollywood ending either, where Alice stopped drinking, took it one day at a time, and lived happily ever after. It also dealt with the enabling behavior of her husband, Michael, and the fact that just because you stop drinking doesn't mean there aren't other issues that you'll have to deal with. It showed the devastating effect that alcoholism can have on the children. The performance of Tina Majorino was incredible as the oldest child, Jessica Green. She really conveys the confusion that children of alcoholics feel. She loves her mother, but when she gets drunk, she hits her. She doesn't stop loving her, but she isn't unscathed. Tina Majorino did a great job, for such a young thespian.<br /><br />Al Franken, now Senator Franken, formerly Stuart Smallie on SNL, who was good enough, smart enough, and dog gone it, people liked him, wrote the script along with Ronald Bass. Franken and Bass did a really good job with the script. It was based on a ten page synopsis by Orson Welles. I thought that Senator Franken was just a clown, but I guess he has a serious side. Who knew? He also has a cameo as the co-pilot, but he never says much.<br /><br />Maybe you are saying that you don't want to see a movie about alcoholism because you don't have a drinking problem. Hey, you drink, you fall down. You get back up. No problem. Work is the curse of the drinking class. Though denial is not just a river in Egypt, the talent of Meg Ryan, Tina Majorino, Andy Garcia, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Al Franken, and Mae Whitcomb cannot be denied.

B001Q8FRNA|5.0|So I was in the record store and came upon this album. I had heard of the Monks and decided to give them a shot. The best decision I have done in a record store. What was most surprising about the record was how experimental it sounded. Keep in mind the Beatles had not yet released Revolver, Dylan Blonde On Blonde, and the Beach Boys Pet Sounds. This is on par with those albums and in some ways better.    The music is unbelievable. It sounds so ahead of its time; it makes Tomorrow Never Knows sound like bubblegum pop. And the sound quality. Man the sound quality is so good you swear it was recorded yesterday. Light In the Attic did a wonderful job remastering this gem. Hope they get their hands on more recordings. Love everything about the record. Even the packaging is awesome.
0385504225|1.0|I loved the Da Vinci Code.  I devoured it in about two days.  I never thought Brown was Hemmingway, but he seemed a master of dramatic pace and tension.  I may yet finish reading The Lost Symbol some day. Maybe I'll just skip to the end to see if anything ever happens. Seriously, it took him how many years to write this?  I don't think it's really Dan Brown's fault.  He probably had one terrific editor for the Da Vinci code, someone who condensed his hundreds of aimless pages into a taunt thriller.  Sadly, that editor wasn't assigned this book.  Dan Brown is probably too big for any underpaid editor to suggest that his prose needs a complete overhaul.  But it is we the readers who must suffer ... bland cardboard characters who say tedious things over and over again with overused clichés ... entire chapters that do nothing to advance the plot ... a villain who is simply comical ... and a tailor-made central mystery that never seems to take off ... oh, and an iPhone commercial early in the book! Sadly, there's not an app to make this one more readable.  So glad I only paid $9.99 for the e-book!
0547258305|5.0|I've heard so much about Graceling and Fire in the bloggerverse that when I heard that Kristin was going to be in Houston I just had to go out and meet her. I honestly loved this novel! This novel starts off with Katsa, a girl who was graced with killing. She has been able to kill men since she was eight years old. She is one of the rare people who are \\"graced\\", these people have two different eye colors to distinguish themselves. Well anyway, she's the niece of the King and is regarded as his thug. He sends her out to complete all the horrible things, like breaking people's arms or cutting off a limb. When she meets Po, a prince graced with combat skills, she doesn't expect that he would turn out to be her friend; mainly because she doesn't know how to have a friend and most people are scared to death to look her in the eye. In this novel she learns different little things about herself as well as the people around her.<br /><br />This novel never failed to surprise me. It's written in third person point of view, but it's limited mostly to Katsa. I thought I was going to have a hard time getting accustomed to the language in the novel, because it's set from back in the day when you had to ride a horse to get anywhere, if you know what I mean. But I found that the language was beautiful and not choppy, the actions of the characters easily identifiable and just the characters themselves are unforgettable. My favorite character was Po. He was just so sweet and awesome; I don't even know how to describe it! Katsa was also pretty awesome in the sense that she is a kick ass character, her ability to fight and then the remorse she feels about the things her uncle makes her do, makes her so human. Like she believes that she's this monster but if you read between the lines, you see that she's trying to escape that and it's just awesome. Now I can't wait to read Fire! That being said, I give this novel 5 out of 5 paws for being awesome!

B00243FQFA|4.0|I guess there are just som many plots that you can come up with in a galaxy far far away, but still I liked it. Knowing that it was the last season kept me waiting to see how it would end. Right up until the end it just carried on like it was goin to go on for years. Then the last episode \\"BOOM\\" all of it in all at once. I hope there is a movie coming out now to tie it together. Isn't that what is supposed to happen?

0307454541|4.0|Mikael Blomkvist is going through a tough time. He has recently been sentenced to gaol (prison) for libel, he has a difficult relationship with his ex-wife and daughter, and the magazine he currently works at is going through tough times. Enter Dirch Frode with an offer that he can't refuse. Though a bit tough to wade through in its beginning chapters, this book, the first of a trilogy, soon becomes a shamelessly fun murder mystery that is as entertaining as anything you're ever likely to read. Like any skillful thriller, it is populated with an earnest protagonist, a few brilliant suspects, and a decently sized cast of dramatic Swedish characters that are always interesting and serve a distinct purpose to the crime in question. Not a lot of U.S. bestsellers take place in Stockholm, but it gives this story a certain edge and serves as a proper backdrop for the Vanger family's history of tradition (and duplicity). Also of note are the author's many different clues and layers, and their relationship to the crime as a whole; the action is always maintained and keeps the story lean and fast-moving. The book as a whole keeps your interest, goes down easy, and ends on a note just subdued enough to make you want to keep reading the rest of the trilogy. Enjoy!
B0019RO4NW|1.0|I know directors will go a long way to achieve their visions sometimes, but starving horses half to death for a movie? There are two nearly skeletal white horses in this film who pathetically lick the bottom of an empty feed bin looking for food. Terry Gilliam first chuckles his delight that their ribs show so prominently that he won't have to use makeup on them. Then he chastises them for seeking nourishment. Then he saddles one of them up and has an actor ride it all day. Does anybody watching this movie really think this is okay? In America he would be up on charges of animal cruelty. Maybe in Europe it's art, but not here. Shame on him and shame on anyone who thinks it okay to starve animals for any reason. I give this movie one star because all I will ever remember is how angry it made me.
B002HNA95E|3.0|Songs like Burning Up, Hollywood, Miles Away, Everybody, and the new track Revolver do not make the grade in my opinion.  I would have switched around some of the 80's tracks. Maybe include Angel in leu of Cherish for example. True Blue would sound amazing here and would have added more variety.  Celebration is heavy on the 80's, nearly 100% of the Immaculate Collection songs are represented here. The choice to recycle Immaculate Collection versions of these songs in most cases is interesting. Celebration may have benefited with a few of these tracks dropped making way for previously ommited tracks. A bonus is having Dress You Up and Who's That Girl included.  Both of these sound great in their remastered form, baring an odd new edit choice with Dress You Up's intro.      The 90's and 00's are under represented and missing are major hits; Deeper and Deeper, I'll Remember, This Used To Be My Playground. A few classic moments like Rain, Give It 2 Me, You'll See, or The Power Of Goodbye would have made a nice addition.  Celebration also has the issue of containing odd new \\"edits.\\" CD 2 in particular has a strange flow created by some odd sequencing choices.  With a little tweaking and more time invested this collection could have been much more comprehensive.     On the positive side it is a joy to hear clasics like \\"Into The Groove\\" & \\"Like A Prayer\\" in full remastered glory and in their original form. However, CD 2 lags and fails to keep up the momentum garnered by disc 1.  There are too many second string singles - Burning Up, Miles Away, Hollywood and the horribly botched Cherish \\"edit\\" come to mind. Too many Madonna moments are missing to make this a definitive collection.  It's a shame because Madonna has more than enough A+ material to fill up these CD's.    The cover art and booklet get an A+. They did a good job here. In summation Celebration is the typical GH mixed bag. It might please the casual listener or those not as familiar with Madonna's amazing back catalogue.  Her die hard fans may be less than impressed as I was. A mediocre greatest hits collection from an artist who is far from average.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|This post-Python series was created, written by and stars John Cleese and his ex-wife Connie Booth. Nearly every one of the 12 episodes here is a classic, chuck full of memorable lines and hilarious situations. Easily one of the funniest TV shows to come out of England or America. And this new version contains comments on every episode by Cleese himself. Buy it and prepare to laugh your arse off.

0385504225|2.0|After looking forward to reading this book I must say I was very disappointed.   The plot drags on without any real definition of characters and the villain is easily identifiable by the middle of the story.   The ending is very weak and provides no real tangible meaningful resolution of the story.   There are symbols of symbols of symbols but eventually too much boring data that sometimes have relevance to the characters and plot and often do not.   The same novel could have been written in 290 pages not 500.   I could not recommend this effort but if you are really interested I would wait for the less expensive paperback edition.
B000002MG1|5.0|This is one of those rock albums that has about 1/4 of it primed for commercial success right off the presses. \\"Automatically liked\\" by the people.  And that's what happened--a number of songs hit the upper end of the charts after this album debuted in 1992.  As for the other songs, they didn't get as much airtime but they are certainly well worth a listen.  This isn't to say that you're going to like every single song on this album, but it's hard not to feel like at least 3/4 of the album is worth listening to again and again, becoming a staple of your regular music collection.<br /><br />I wish R.E.M. had kept themselves more in touch with what they achieved in this album.  From here, they went on to produce Monster, which was a radical departure from their previous music.  Experimentation is to be encouraged in the art of music, because if you don't take chances you don't grow.  BUT, there's the matter of balance.  Successful rock bands mix the music in their albums, incorporating their future directions little by little.  It's extremely risky to make a 180 degree turn in one fell swoop.<br /><br />I listen to this album and I can't help but feel like this is REM's last great work in terms of the pop/folk/rock music genre.  I expect that the diversion they've been on since will tire them out, as pressure from the record labels mounts due to lack of sales, and that they'll have a \\"grass roots\\" revisit to the sound that once made them so well known.  There's plenty of material to use; life is saturated with change and conflict, considering that is going on today.  There are plenty more stories to tell.<br /><br />So, if \\"Automatic For The People\\" has somehow been left out of your collection, reconsider it.  If you don't want to buy it new, then pick up a lightly used one from an auction website.  But don't bother downloading individual songs via MP3... you'll end up paying much more than you would for the whole the album as you get to know the work more.
B002GY9F9K|4.0|I usually do not write reviews for TV shows (I do not watch that many). I must say, however, I completely enjoyed watching this series in 3 days straight with my wife (most of it was on weekend)! After the first few episodes which were slow, we were both hooked. I felt the actors/actresses gave a solid performance. Craig Horner, Bridget Regan and Bruce Spence make an awesome team. Overall a fine production. What I really liked about the series is that each adventure usually is completed within a single episode even though it ties in with the overall storyline. Also most of the adventures were well written, witty and logical. I really liked the one called \\"mirror\\" and the trick the wizard plays at the end.      (Warning: SPOILER)    Having said this, the last episode killed it for me (and my wife). Well, as a fan of D&D, I was disappointed there was no true epic show down between the hero and the villain. It goes through this tedium of hero transported to another time etc etc etc. Not even the last episode could convey to me why the Darken Rahl (the villain) was so feared. He did not seem to have much powers to work up a good fight with the hero. A good sword fight between the two was the least I was expecting. I know this may sound a bit cheesy but, I enjoyed the series because it worked up all the elements of the good vs evil. My wife was disappointed that the actress had to side with the villain and bear him a son after having a wonderful and romantic journey with the hero for the course of 21 episodes (her words more or less). In essence, we would have loved to see an alternate ending rather than making it too tragic and then ending with virtually no battle between the good and evil. Just a lame way for the villain to die. Well, in my opinion at least.     But do not allow this to keep you from enjoying this series. Overall, we had a great time watching the series. It did transport us to a different world.
B000002MU3|2.0|Reviews of art are very subjective.  There are no doubt people who LOVE this album and in reading this review would scoff at it, calling me an idiot.  Then there are core fans who feel the band's best work peaked with Document and have bashed this album with 1 star.<br /><br />My taste for REM is spread across from \\"Chronic Town\\" through \\"Automatic For The People\\".  I did find that much of what followed Green sounds rather \\"pop trendy\\", but still likable.  I was hoping that the next album would experiment in a more alternative rock sound, not grunge or glam rock.  But Monster became just that--something I want to run away from.  Again, my opinion...<br /><br />Monster was a huge seller, right up there with \\"Automatic For The People\\" and \\"Out Of Time\\".  It's actually quite baffling to me.  The only way I can explain it is that a good portion of existing fans were hungry for something new and bought it out of faith, and R.E.M.'s changed sound attracted new fans.<br /><br />This album is a radical departure from R.E.M.'s previous work.  Sure, it is only natural for a band to change over time, and they did demonstrate an evolution from Murmur over the years.  It was a good but slow progression.  Then what happened?  Did Stipe's fame go to his head?  Was the band getting tired of the Pop sound they'd cultivated?  Whatever was the incentive, they did make a significant change that appears to be influenced by the music trends of the mid 90's.  And this coming from a band that just begged to be different (their early work had Stipe mumbling so much that you couldn't make out the lyrics, and the band refused to print lyrics in the album papers).  Well, they're different now alright... radically different from their earlier sound.  If your taste in R.E.M.'s music is similar to mine, you probably won't like this one.<br /><br />What's really interesting is that all of the other albums that followed this one, \\"New Adventures in Hi Fi\\", \\"Up\\", \\"Reveal\\", \\"Around The Sun\\", and finally \\"Accelerate\\" have not sold well at all compared to \\"Monster\\" and the two previous albums.  Monster seems to have marked the end of what R.E.M. used to be.  It's very sad...well at all compared to \\"Monster\\" and the two previous albums.  Monster seems to have marked the end of what R.E.M. used to be.  It's very sad...
B002JM1VJG|5.0|This is a great dvd with the ultimate experience on madonna's music videos. It has all the famous 80's, 90's and more recent videos. The quality of both sound and video is excellent. I still don't understand why people review the dvd as poor quality, the only reason that comes to mind is that they are Madonna haters. Some of these videos are almost three decades old and the quality is amazing even on today's standards. BUY THIS COLLECTION. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.
B0000549B0|1.0|I have already dealt with this problem, but I'll post this because I feel so strongly about it.  Amazon used to take better care of it's customers and it's products.  Lately, apparently, they use 3rd party companies to do their shipping and what results is flimsy packaging and broken products.  I ordered a DVD and, whereas even a year ago, this item would have come in a small cardboard box, insulating my DVD from damage, a few weeks ago I received it in a thin, plastic covering (which is bad for the environment, as well, but it - supposedly - cuts costs for the company).  Well, I argue the \\"cutting costs\\".  I ended up returning the DVD because the box had gotten broken in the shipping process.  So, where's the savings for them?  They lost a sale.  It was a hassle for them, and I KNOW it was a hassle for me.  So, I will no longer be buying DVDs or CDs from Amazon until this problem gets remedied.  By the way, the actual movie is excellent.  You should buy it, just not from Amazon    Caroline

B002NXSRX4|5.0|I, like many other people, loved G.I. Joe as a kid. When I saw they were doing this I was pumped. When I saw a trailer, I was even more excited. I am not one of those \\"purists\\", where everything has to be the same as it was in the cartoon or comic book or whatever. I really can't stand when people are like, \\"Oh, they changed such and such,,,,they raped my childhood!!\\". I mean, how bad did your childhood suck then? But, I digress. I got just what I expected from this movie. An over-the-top kick-ass action flick. The scene in Paris has to be one of the coolest action sequences ever put to film. Is it perfect? Hell no. Is it totally amazing fun? Hell yes. I will put it like this, if you are a fan of movies like The Mummy, Torque, Shoot Em Up, Crank, Wanted, The Transporter, even Live Free or Die Hard,,,,you will most likely like G.I. Joe.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|I owe my love for Michael Buble to my mother and my daughter, but mainly my 9 year old daughter. After listening to Feeling Good on repeat in the car she was able to convert not only me, but my 10 year old son as well. What can I say? I love, love, love this new album. My favorite track is Heartache Tonight a classical Eagles song that Buble puts a wonderful twist on by introducing it to big band. I was a huge fan of this song to begin with but I love it even more now that it is blended with the amazing sound of big band. It's as good as a hot fudge sundae! Be sure to give this new album a listen to if you have a chance. I highly recommend it and so does my daughter.
0307265730|4.0|I neglected to pick up this book for the longest time, thinking I would have little interest in cross-cultural struggles of which I've had no experience. But, truthfully, as a reader, you need only have had experience with parents, siblings, boyfriends or girlfriends or any friends at all, to appreciate the stories in this book.<br /><br />In particular, I was charmed by the title story, that of a father who visits his married daughter and his grandson. The father has a secret, and the daughter has a dilemma. The story is narrated from both of their points of view, and both are utterly sympathetic characters. The daughter's thoughts are so universal to the human experience, regardless of culture, that they struck me as utterly true. For example: \\"Even with Akash [her son] to care for, part of her was beginning to prefer the solitude, without Adam [her husband] hovering around, full of concern about her state of mind, her mood.\\"<br /><br />The other stories did not grip me as fully; perhaps because most of them concern young lovers and their dramas. It's just my time of life, I suppose, that makes the relationship between parents and their adult children (and husbands and wives) more interesting to me.<br /><br />But all of the stories are compelling, and the language spare and beautiful. I rarely read fiction, but have always loved the short story form, because the brevity forces an author to pare down events and emotions to their essential core. I also appreciated Ms. Lahiri's understated characters; they seemed like real people to me. I recently read Lorrie Moore's [[ASIN:0375409289 A Gate at the Stairs]] and was frustrated with the outlandish characters who populated that book. Few writers show the restraint that Ms. Lahiri does. For some readers, that translates into boredom; for me, it is a pathway to engagement.
B00005JMX6|5.0|Great great great movie. The lead actress Elisha Cuthbert is incredibly hot and the movie is full of laughs. I especially liked the porno director played by Timothy Olyphant. I'm a fan of his work in Deadwood where he plays a serious sherrif, so it was awesome to see him pull of this completely different role as a slimeball. This is one you will not regret adding to your collection.
B001N26GFC|3.0|Mike Leigh's \\"Happy-Go-Lucky\\" has a lot to recommend it, not least being a star turn by little-known (at least on this side of the pond) Sally Hawkins as Poppy, the happy-go-lucky character of the title.  Poppy is a human cherry soda with a healthy splash of vodka - full of life, almost overly sweet, and just a bit dangerous.<br /><br />It's interesting that someone could make a movie where the key question is, can someone really go through life reacting to every single thing with a positive attitude?  Such a person is Poppy, an effervescent bohemian elementary school teacher in London.  Poppy's the kind of gal who responds to her bike being stolen as creating an opportunity to drive.  She responds to virtually every line in a conversation with a little joke or pun and a friendly snicker.  She's not a wise-acre, or a comedian who's \\"always on\\" - she's just walking on the sunny side of the street every blasted day.<br /><br />Life eventually conspires to put roadblocks in her path as she meets new people, including the troubled, the homeless, and the perfect (a late-movie candidate for Serious Boyfriend is just a bit too much from Central Casting to be believed).  Some of these folks react to Poppy with delight, others with fear, and one in particular with blinding rage as her friendliness is mistaken for flirtatiousness.  Eventually even Poppy confronts a person that even she cannot abide.<br /><br />Why only three stars?  Perhaps I'm being unfair - I like much of this movie, not least the fact that \\"HGL\\" is one of those charming British movies where you almost need subtitles to understand the dialect.  This isn't a movie where Judie Dench is ripping off perfectly enunciated sentences to John Gielgud - this is a Street Movie where characters talk like real people.  Sure, you lose something in the process, but the rhythm gets you where you need to go.<br /><br />Unfortunately the sad fact is that this movie is essentially without a plot.  The story is just about Poppy and her daily life.  We see her interact with a few people, many of whom are in one scene and then vanish.  Sure, there's a bit of conflict with her driving instructor and a bit of romance, but essentially we're watching Poppy waltz through life.  I confess that I like a bit more plot on the bones of my movies - it's the same reason why \\"2001\\" has never done anything for me.  Perhaps that makes me a Philistine, but there you go.<br /><br />I also have grave problems with one scene where Poppy goes off by herself at night to confront a homeless man.  Poppy, a super-sweet girl who just might be able to take down a butterfly as long as it didn't get the jump on her, should know much better than to take such a stupid risk in London.  Perpetual cheerfulness is fine, but it doesn't help you in every situation.  My problem with this scene is that it was so unrealistic and stupid a maneuver that it reminded me that I was watching a movie.  It reminded me to stop suspending my disbelief, and everything that followed this scene felt contrived.<br /><br />As a result, I must put \\"HGL\\" in the category of Good Film That I Have No Interest in Watching Again for a Long Time, if Ever.  Thus, three stars.r interact with a few people, many of whom are in one scene and then vanish.

0977476073|5.0|he Ford translation is very easy to read just like it says on the cover. It is not dumbed down to be easy to read either. It is just well written.    Is it better or worse than the Manheim translation? It is clearly better and more well researched. You only have to lay the two side by side and compare the first few paragraphs of each chapter to see the difference. The Ford translation includes insert notes that explain the text as well which Manheim does not include. Don't take my word for it, compare the Ford translation to the others for yourself and I am sure you will come to the same conclusion.    The supplementary book, Mein Kampf A Translation Controversy, is clearly meant to promote the Ford translation. They make no secret of the fact that they are promoting the Ford translation and both books are printed by the same company, however the accuracy of the long list of corrections it has is hard to ignore. It has about a hundred pages of corrections, comparisions, and explanations which show why the corrections were made, why the new verison is correct and the old versions were incorrect. The logic is pretty straight forward.    I suggest you read both the Manheim and Ford and decide which you like best.
B002CMLIJ6|3.0|Well I don't have anything else to say, but to say the movie was owesome. except one thing, the end was not too much good than I expected. Just like AVP-R.

B002MW50KO|4.0|It amazes, or at least saddens, me that so many people seem to have such bad things to say about this album...yes, it is a departure for Bob, yes he does push his voice perhaps a little more than he should in a couple of songs, but it is such a fun album...I have listed to it multiple times for multiple days and it gets better and better...and let's not forget the fact that the $ goes to feed the hungry...maybe that's why Hannity hated it so much...he'd have to acknowledge there is a hunger problem in this country before acknowledging someone doing something about it....
0385504225|3.0|It wasn't as good as either Angels and Demons, or the Da Vinci Code.  But good nonetheless.  I fully appreciate other critiques.  However, I took a lighthearted approach to the story, and allowed myself to enjoy the adventurous ride it offers.  After all, it is not only a fictional novel, but a fantasy.  It was most difficult to wrap all of the symbology, philosophy, theology, US history and DC geology into this story.  I can understand where Atheists, fundamentalists and neocons (who believe this is an exclusively  Christian nation) would have qualms over the story.  The book stands for the proposition that the \\"one nation under God\\", is not about Jesus Christ, but God in the form of evolved human beings and co-creators.  That's a stretch for many.  Dan Brown did miss one very important theological point and symbol, however: The \\"WORD\\" , according to Hindus and Buddhists is the vibrational energy of the Universe.  It is replicated in the chant of AUM, or OM.  Christianity believes  the \\"WORD\\" was made flesh when the Universal Love (i.e. God) took form through Jesus Christ.  But I can forgive Brown for this oversight.  The book could have been 100 pages shorter.  And how the lead characters could do all they did at the end after all they went through during the previous 24 hours, is unimaginable; but it just goes to confirm that it is a fantasy. But is was a fun read.  I also think it was written for a more juvenile audience than for high caliber literary critics. I give it 3 out of 5 stars.[[ASIN:0385504225 The Lost Symbol]]
B002KH4KSY|5.0|Imagine being able to go back, and re-shoot what is regarded as  Classic film the way YOU wanted to the first time but were afraid to.. Imagine a story, from the King of Horror, filmed the way it should have been the first time?<br /><br />If you can, then you have the NEW Children of the Corn, refilmed and rewritten by Donald P Borchers (based on the King short story).  If you liked the original, then you will be shocked by this version.  Firstly, this is horror/suspense the way it should be done.  The horror/suspense is aided by the big question, what the hell is going on in Gatlin, Nebraska?  Secondly, where are all of the people?  Why does it seem that time has stood still?<br /><br />Burt and Vicki, an unhappily married couple about to seek divorce, travel through Nebraska just because.  A lonely stretch of road puts them corn country, and in the path of an escaping little boy.  Striking him with his Thunderbird, they look for a place to report the crime, and discover the deserted town of Gatlin.  The year is 1975 and Burt, a Viet Nam vet is still suffering from Post Traumatic Stress  Syndrome.  His wife, a preachers daughter, doesn't understand, and their marital tension builds just as the mystery before them escalated into a fight for their lives.  The children, led by a pre-teen preacher, Isaac and Malachai (his brother), control a large group of children who have lived 12 years without adults.  He who walks in the Corn, rules with fear, yet the fanatical, cult grip on the children in undeniable. As Borchers says in his special feature, one of the points he wanted to make that as mature individuals (and a society), we must not follow blindly, but rather be able to ask questions and seek wise guidance.  The youth, in this film, were the adults in the first film.  Placing youths in the main roles  creates another moral focal point that is accentuated as those above the age of 18 are sacrificed horrifically (denying their `mature' influence upon the youth), to personify `And a child shall lead them'.  That aside, as Vicki and Burt seek answers, the brutality of the children is obvious.  Stuck in an old testament mind set, sacrifice is the only solution.  Without it, there can be no absolution.  The outlanders, as Isaac puts it, are to be sacrificed so the Children of the Corn can become pure once more as those above 18 are purged one more time.<br /><br />This is one frightening film.  The cinematography is outstanding.  The stark, empty town conveys and magnifies the blood lust while providing an atmospheric setting for the pursuit of the outlanders.  The cornfields serve to focus our attention on the conflict, and symbolize the conflict itself.  Where have all the parents gone????  The adults not only fertilized the object of their cult, yet also created it with their own `sinful' behaviours.  The `cross' has become a perverted corn decorated, symbol of evil and religious misunderstanding.  Where grace should be, blood sacrifice (Old Testament), rules supreme and no-one is safe.  The big question here is simple, how real is your faith?  What is it based on?<br /><br />Whatever you come away with, you will never think of corn the same way again.<br /><br />There is violence.  There is blood.  There is religious symbolism.  There is no redemption in Gatlin, Nebraska today.<br /><br />Tim Lasiutaa child shall lead them'.

B001EYGOEM|5.0|My daughter got this cd as a gift and plays it over and over in the car.  Somehow, both she and I never tire of Taylor Swift's beautiful voice and great lyrics.  My only concern is that we are wearing it out!  Way to go Taylor! We love you!
B0029LHW4A|5.0|Long time JET fan. Overall Great album! and much more up-beat than their last album; shine on. I would say however; a number of the songs and guitar riffs are reminiscent of other bands (one in particular comes to mind: The beatles).    If you like garage rock, and you don't mind some recycled sounds, its still a really good album.
B001C4CI8U|3.0|The stories in Fringe are good, intelligent and well done. But my main reason for not giving it a 5-star rating is because there is too much graphical violence. It is too much shock factor for me. If they can eliminate that, it would make these an excellent series.
B001R22TBI|4.0|I picked up Katie Melua's greatest hits album after doing a lot of research listening to her music on YouTube and Comcast. Being of the '80's generation, I feel that I'm usually out of touch with today's music and try to make concerted efforts to listen to what's current. Most of today's music I don't care for - the melodies are lack-luster and the arrangements sterile.<br /><br />What drew me to Katie Melua's music was the MUSIC. Being that music is my profession (I have an MA in composition), I may tend to be a bit more critical than most reviewers. The melodies are well-constructed, not too repetitive, and the hooks catchy. For the most part, the arrangements are simple and very easy to listen to. Her style is very melancholy and reminds me of Gordon Lightfoot meets Natalie Imbruglia (her 2nd album, anyway).<br /><br />There is a lot of variety on this album, from slow ballads to upbeat blues. My favorite tune off this set is \\"Nine Millions Bicycles.\\" The theme is comparing the depth of the singer's love to the number of bicycles in Beiging, China. The melody is beautifully written and upon closer examination, one discovers the use of the pentatonic scale - very cool choice on the composer's part.<br /><br />\\"If I Were A Sailboat\\" is another hit along the same genre as \\"Bicycles,\\" as are about half of the songs on this hits compilation. I love the melody in \\"When You Taught Me How To Dance,\\" especially the bridge when she sweeps up into her head voice.  Another favorite of mine is \\"Spider's Web,\\" a melodic song and one of the few that she composed on the set. She has three upbeat tunes, the spiciest of all is \\"Two Bare Feet.\\" I haven't quite figured out the lyrics (perhaps due to ignorance), but I really like the background music, especially the brass and the piano solo. A very exquisite solo, indeed.<br /><br />The downside to the album is Katie's immature voice. Don't get me wrong - the tone quality is gorgeous and she demonstrates a wide vocal range. However, she scoops the notes on just about every phrase - even in the middle of phrases- and that gets annoying after a while. I tended to look past it because the music is so good - after all, I bought the album; however, hearing it on every song means that it will be like that on her regular studio albums. So....unless she changes her technique, this will be the only album I purchase.<br /><br />Katie Melua is a young artist with a great future. She has tapped into great writers, musicians and has great potential. Usually I'm not a \\"hits\\" person, but for this artist, that's where it is for me.about every phrase - even in the middle of phrases- and that gets annoying after a while.

0439023483|5.0|I decided to purchase The Hunger Games after reading Stephen King's review of it in \\"Entertainment Weekly.\\"  I'm so glad I did.  After reading it, I knew my general English I students would love this book.  The class is mostly boys and all the students are reluctant readers.  I convinced my principal to let me purchase 15 hard cover copies (at $10.52 with free shipping it's cheaper than most paperbacks in educational catalogs).  Every single one of my students has fallen in love with this book!  Even those that HATE hunting absolutely cannot wait to come to class each day to read it.  No other novel has had this sort of impact on my students.  Now I have to convince my principal to purchase 15 copies of Catching Fire!  :)
B002P7UCMC|4.0|It is refreshing to hear Rammstein return to form.  I have not heard such a great album from them since Sehnsucht.  This album is hard and aggressive, and that is where Rammstein shines.  Waidmanns Heil (track #3) is the stand out for me personally, however, every track is good to great except the final track on disc 1 which is too slow and boring to redeem itself.  I was surprised how much I liked Frühling in Paris as well, a slower song which builds into a powerful ballad.  I am one of those who can't give this five stars because I only reserve that rating for the best of the best, plus the second disc chose only one remix and it was of the only song I disliked.  I have been a fan since Du Hast steamrolled into America in the mid-90's but the last two albums had me worried this band was waning.  Give this a listen if you love industrial/rock with heavy guitars, just expect very very very little English (which is to be expected).
B0029O08WA|5.0|First of all, I am not a part of the target demographic for the Twilight series. I haven't read New Moon and probably never will. But I know great music when I hear it: This soundtrack is loaded with some of the best Indie music available.<br /><br />Second of all, both of my daughters are Twilight fan(atics). They love this soundtrack. This is probalbly due to me constantly playing this type of music while they were growing up. Their open-mindedness allow them to enjoy this introspective and meloncholy music (they also love the more upbeat Twilight soundtrack.)<br /><br />Finally, any soundtrack that seemlessly flows from the sadly melodic Death Cab to Thom Yorke's ethereal croon and then back again to the lovely layers of Grizzly Bear is a keeper.  My hope is that some of the young fans who discover (and like) this type of music will delve deeper into the genre and discover stellar artists like The Smiths, Sigur Ros and Neutral Milk Hotel. As Natalie Portman stated in Garden State (another great soundtrack), \\"You gotta hear these songs, they will change your life I promise you...\\"
B0025KVLV0|3.0|I won't repeat the details of how difficult the Get Back sessions were, that's been done elsewhere. Suffice to say, 'Let It Be' is one of the weaker Beatles albums, for a combination of reasons. Obviously, the personal and creative tensions in the band and the album's convoluted genesis play a part. But I also think the attempt to create a very raw, let-it-all-hang-out album, complete with errors and studio chatter, makes `Let It Be' far less polished than the Beatles' other works. To be honest, it actually comes across as unprofessional and is a bit of an insult to the Beatles' legacy.     Clearly, the two standout tracks on the album are the McCartney compositions 'Get Back' and the title track. The former is one of their best rockers, the latter a great ballad. No arguments here, these two songs stand with The Beatles' very best work. Another highlight is the driving 'I've Got A Feeling', with Lennon and McCartney collaborating closely (interesting, considering the two were composing almost entirely alone by this time), while Harrison's 'I Me Mine' seems to look forward to his masterpiece 'All Things Must Pass'.     Unfortunately, the rest of the album is a mixed bag, and seems to merely showcase the unfocussed, unproductive nature of the Get Back sessions. The folky opener 'Two Of Us' and Harrison's `For You Blue' are pretty good, but 'Dig It' and 'Maggie Mae' are pointless throwaways, 'Dig A Pony' is okay but nothing special, and 'The Long And Winding Road' is completely ruined by layers of syrupy schmaltz (added without McCartney's knowledge). The fact that they were forced to dust off Lennon's 'Across The Universe' from 1968, and the by-the-numbers rocker 'One After 909' from their earliest days to fill out the album shows how poor the sessions must have been. Oddly, 'Don't Let Me Down' is left off, which was a big mistake, considering it was one of the best songs from the sessions.     I would strongly recommend picking up `Let It Be....Naked', which is a more polished and professional piece of work. Tighter production and a better track listing make `Naked' the definitive version of `Let It Be'. But I feel the original album doesn't quite do enough to disguise the fact that the Get Back sessions were mostly a directionless mess.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|I am a huge Michael Jackson fan, so much so that I had most of the music in this collection and the dvd, but after his death I felt that I really wanted to make this a part of my collection of MJ memorabilia.

0061730327|5.0|This is a wonderful book that works on many levels.<br /><br />Many of the previous reviewers have commented on the story, so I won't re-review what happens. Instead, I'd like to point out the obvious--when you dare to dream, refuse to recognize the word \\"can't\\" or \\"no\\" -- The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind is what can happen. William Kamkwamba was born in Malawi, which is about the size of Pennsylvania and is nestled among the countries of Mozambique, Zambia, and Tanzania. It is home to approximately 14 million people and has an infant mortality rate of 89.0/1000 and the average life span is 43 years and there is a high incidence of HIV/AIDS. These statistics alone show that poverty and hardship is the norm. This is an encapsulated summary of the country William Kamkwamba was born into; so it is even more remarkable that this determined young man who read a book called \\"Using Energy\\" and saw the potential of a windmill. Not only saw the potential, but had the drive to build one. Called crazy by his friends and neighbors, William never gave up on his dream.<br /><br />When William was 14 a devastating famine struck Malawi and he was forced to leave school as his parents could not afford the $80/year tuition. He read every science book he could find. William kept focused on his dream to build a windmill to bring electricity and water to his village. Using basically scrap metal and other found objects, William built his first windmill.<br /><br />You get a sense of the past and present of William's life. The traditional African thought mixed with a more futuristic thought from his reading. He skillfully blends that past and present with his prose. You see the clash of old and new through his eyes as he takes you on a very personal journey. You get a sense of the influences in his life from his father to the witch doctor to his village.<br /><br />In a society where poverty is the norm and acceptance of that poverty as the norm, William's journey is all the more remarkable.<br /><br />Sometimes when you read memoirs or biographies from first time writers, they are dry, lacking in passion. You read them and come away marveling at the accomplishments or the reason the person wrote it, but you lack a background and understanding of the whys and wherefores. Kamkwamba's memoir is very well written. You see the whole picture and that makes him and his accomplishments all the more remarkable!memoirs or biographies from first time writers, they are dry, lacking in passion.

B000002N9L|3.0|The first time I heard this CD a few years ago as a teenager I hated it because \\"it wasn't like his other music\\".  But as my musical taste has grown and understand that Prince isn't genre specific I actually like this album. While it's still not one of my favorites it's most definitely not trash.  Less Funk/R&B more ROCK, so If your looking for Diamonds & Pearls this one isn't for you. A good Artist not only challenges themselves but their audience as well and Prince is definitely the master of that! Now if I could only find a place in my heart for Parade and LoveSexy LOL!
1401323820|5.0|I don't watch Castle and when I picked up [[ASIN:1401323820 Heat Wave]] I had no clue it was based on the television show.<br /><br />The book is fast paced with wonderfully fleshed out characters. Detective Nikki Heat reminds me a bit of JD Robb's Eve Dallas and Rook, the male protagonist/writer Jameson Rook plays well with and off of Heat's personality.<br /><br />Heat Wave begins with Nikki Heat arriving at the scene of a murder. Jameson Rook shows up soon after. Heat discovers the jumper is Matthew Starr, the much older husband of Kimberly. As the investigation progresses, Heat and Rook discover both husband and wife have many secrets. There is some predictability with the story and plot, but plenty of twists and turns for the avid mystery reader. The author wove in humor, sexual tension between Heat and Rook, and a really decent mystery in this first book.<br /><br />The book will probably be greatly appreciated by watchers of the television series. I've only seen promotional ads for the show and I caught some cross referencing or similarities to it. Actually, the book interested me enough to watch Castle next week and read any more books Richard Castle writes!
B002RHIBVY|5.0|I loved this film, which is surprising given two things.  First, I am not a food guy.  I don't appreciate gourmet cooking and I can't cook anything that doesn't involve a microwave.  I don't really enjoy going to restaurants and I would rather watch bowling or golf (two sports that I loathe) than any cooking show.  Food plays less of a role in my life than it does for most people.  Oddly enough, however, I have seen an unusually large amount of Julia Child.  My ex-wife was a devoted viewer of Julia's show so her voice is emblazoned onto my brain in an indelible way.  Second, I'm not a fan of Meryl Streep.  I make no defense of this.  She simply rubs me the wrong way.  The most I can say in making a case against her is that I'm always aware of her \\"acting.\\"  I find her deliberate and self-conscious and always \\"plying her craft.\\"  I was delighted when I heard Katherine Hepburn make the same claim.  There is no doubting her talent, but for me I'm always conscious of her as an actress assuming a role, instead of becoming the role.  I will not argue against anyone who believes that she is the greatest actress of her age.  This is about me and my reaction to her.  And it is a positive one.  So, the film had these two large marks against it from my perspective, so when I say that I loved the movie, it had a fair amount to overcome.<br /><br />So why did I enjoy this film so much, despite my built in biases?  Because both the stories in the film - that of Julia Childs and Julie Power - were about everyday people deciding to do something that no one expected them to do.  Julia Child undertaking French cooking more as a hobby, a pleasant way of passing the time, or Julie Powell writing her own blog detailing her cooking all of the recipes in the book that grew out of Julia's book.  There is no difference between Julia learning to cook or Julie writing a blog and any of us - me, you, her, or him - undertaking a self-empowering project.  (This resonated very strongly with me because I am seriously contemplating starting my own blog, either on an established website or by starting my own website.)  Maybe the projects that we take on won't result in publishing a book or having a movie made, but the important thing is doing something that engages our interests, that excites us, that makes us feel, in the words of the singer Hayden, that every day is too short.  This is, in short, an inspirational movie.  And frankly, as I've been thinking of starting my own blog (split between writing on culture and writing on contemporary politics), I have realized that I have a built in hesitancy in starting this project that this film made me feel should not be decisive.  I felt, watching this, that I should . . . just start the damned blog already!  In short, just as Julie was inspired by the story of Julia Child mastering the art of French cooking, so I was inspired by Julie's story.  We should all be inspired to do whatever we would like to do, but have been prevented only by fear or failure.  Maybe my blog will be junk and maybe no one will read it, but I've wanted to undertake it.  Hopefully the story of Julie and Julia will inspire others to take on projects that they've wanted to.<br /><br />So yeah, this movie hit me where I live.  And that is the mark of a really good movie; it sucks you in and makes you a part of it.<br /><br />Even if one doesn't experience this as a inspirational film, it is a ton of fun on a host of other levels.  The cast is extraordinary, with supporting actors of the quality of Stanley Tucci and Jane Lynch in small but important roles.  As I said, I'm probably Meryl Streep's smallest fan, but she really nailed Julia Childs's voice.  She absolutely and completely nailed the voice, even though she was physically wrong for the role.  Meryl Streep is half a foot too small for the role and really has not facial resemblance to her, but make up, pulling out every trick in the book for making her look taller (extremely high heels,surrounding Steep with shorter actors, the use of extremely short actors, and the constant use of forced perspective (the technique whereby someone is moved to the foreground while everyone else is kept in the background to make them look taller - this technique is used constantly in the Harry Potter films to make the 6'1 Robbie Coltrane to look over 8' as Hagrid).  Frankly, Streep is not very convincing as Child . . . except for the voice.  I hit Youtube after seeing the film and watched some clips of Julia Child and cold detect no difference between Steep's voice and Childs's.  I had a much easier time enjoying Amy Adams as Julie Powell.  Adams is not the virtuoso that Meryl Streep is, but she always seems so tremendously natural in every role she plays.  And as Julie she plays her as Everywoman.  She plays just an everyday person.  They definitely glam her down for the role, giving her a remarkably nondescript hairdo and minimizing her astonishing good looks (though they can't hide those huge blue eyes).  (I have to confess that I also have a soft spot for Amy Adams because she bears a sharp resemblance to an ex-girlfriend.)<br /><br />The plot is a simple one.  Julie Powell, feeling somewhat distraught that a pompous and somewhat absurd friend has started her own blog, decides to start her own blog.  But what on?  Her husband suggests doing it on something she loves.  Well, she loves Julia Childs book on cooking.  So she decides to cook every recipe in Childs's book and blog about it.  The blog later was published as a book and . . . as the closing credits point out, made into a movie.  This is all told in parallel with the story leading up to Julia Childs's growth of an interest in French cooking, her development of her interest, and her eventual publication of MASTERING THE ART OF FRENCH COOKING, the book that popularized gourmet cooking in America.  The one really odd twist in their parallel stories is when Julie learns that Julia, who was aware of the blog, was disdainful of it.  I would have liked to know more about this, about precisely why she found it disrespectful.  One hears few bad things about Julia Childs, but this particular tidbit does not place her in a very nice light.  But you have to respect Powell for pushing forward with her own project despite the disapproval of her idol.<br /><br />One little twist delighted me.  You know the game where you get to name the six people you would like to invite to dinner?  One of the people I would invite is Bernard DeVoto, a brilliant man of letters from the mid-twentieth century, who wrote a series of brilliant popular histories and was a columnist for Harper's (in his column The Easy Chair DeVoto initiated a public information campaign against the attempt by some in Congress to sell off a huge percentage of public lands in America - he is credited with almost single-handedly stopping making most public lands private, arguably the greatest environmental achievement in American history).  DeVoto was a tremendous prose writer, a powerful personality, and a natural teacher (Wallace Stegner was DeVoto's best student).  So I was delighted when DeVoto's widow, Avis DeVoto, appeared in the film as the talent scout who let an editor at Alfred Knopf know about Julia's book.  I have actually read a book that Avis solicited.  She asked Wallace Stegner to write a biography of Bernard.  Somewhat against his own inclination, Stegner agreed, producing the exceptionally nice bio THE UNEASY CHAIR.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this film.

Meryl Streep is half a foot too small for the role and really has not facial resemblance to her, but make up, pulling out every trick in the book for making her look taller (extremely high heels,surrounding Steep with shorter actors, the use of extremely short actors, and the constant use of forced perspective (the technique whereby someone is moved to the foreground while everyone else is kept in the background to make them look taller - this technique is used constantly in the Harry Potter films to make the 6'1 Robbie Coltrane to look over 8' as Hagrid).  Frankly, Streep is not very convincing as Child . . . except for the voice.  I hit Youtube after seeing the film and watched some clips of Julia Child and cold detect no difference between Steep's voice and Childs's.  I had a much easier time enjoying Amy Adams as Julie Powell.  Adams is not the virtuoso that Meryl Streep is, but she always seems so tremendously natural in every role she plays.  And as Julie she plays her as Everywoman.  She plays just an everyday person.  They definitely glam her down for the role, giving her a remarkably nondescript hairdo and minimizing her astonishing good looks (though they can't hide those huge blue eyes).  (I have to confess that I also have a soft spot for Amy Adams because she bears a sharp resemblance to an ex-girlfriend.)<br /><br />The plot is a simple one.  Julie Powell, feeling somewhat distraught that a pompous and somewhat absurd friend has started her own blog, decides to start her own blog.  But what on?  Her husband suggests doing it on something she loves.  Well, she loves Julia Childs book on cooking.  So she decides to cook every recipe in Childs's book and blog about it.  The blog later was published as a book and . . . as the closing credits point out, made into a movie.  This is all told in parallel with the story leading up to Julia Childs's growth of an interest in French cooking, her development of her interest, and her eventual publication of MASTERING THE ART OF FRENCH COOKING, the book that popularized gourmet cooking in America.  The one really odd twist in their parallel stories is when Julie learns that Julia, who was aware of the blog, was disdainful of it.  I would have liked to know more about this, about precisely why she found it disrespectful.  One hears few bad things about Julia Childs, but this particular tidbit does not place her in a very nice light.

DeVoto was a tremendous prose writer, a powerful personality, and a natural teacher (Wallace Stegner was DeVoto's best student).

B001EYGOEM|5.0|What a talented young lady. I have always considered myself to be an individual able to hide emotions when needed. However, I have to admit to listening to Taylors music and struggling at times to not get a little watery eyed listening to her beautiful lyrics. The song, The Best Day, is beautiful and demonstrates her strong sense of family. You know, when we are born, it is kind of like standing in a lottery line to see what cards you will be dealt. Will you be attractive, beautiful on the inside and maybe have a special talent. Well, Taylor Swift has hit the trifecta. If you read these reviews Taylor, stay well so that you may continue to share your gift with us, your fans. Your music is so beautiful. What a bright future is before you.
1401323820|3.0|The book is not bad.  In fact, it's reasonably compelling read and there aren't any major faults in the book.  The characters are decent, but they're also nearly identical to those on the show.  Not sort of close, but nearly identical.  (Down to the point of rehashing scenes from the show, which is, the point of his sitting in with the HYPD to write a book.)    So why 3 stars?  First off, it's written at a 5th grade level, which is to be expected since it's for a TV audience and they're going for broad appeal.  That's great and all, but this is a little light even for the genre.  Secondly, it's HIGHLY sanitized for a the ABC audience.  (It feels about as gritty as a Jello(tm) pudding.)  Thirdly, there are scattered, shameless product placements.  (Why do I suddenly want a Chipotle carnitas burrito...)  Lastly, it's a bit short and if this is the book that he's holding up on the show, then the hard cover must be in very large print.    If you REALLY love the show and want to read what is essentially a good episode, this is for you.  if you're expecting this to be a novel that could hold it's own without the show, you'll probably be little disappointed.  (And some of the 5 star reviews are clearly shills for the book.  \\"Immaculate prose\\"?!?  Please!  It's cliched, gimmicky, recycled-from-the-show but still entertaining.  But unfortunately, that's all it is.
0802798225|2.0|Welcome to Sap City!<br /><br />This book is like Romeo and Juliet with a cute twist. in reality, if i really look at it from an author's perspective, it was pretty cute. the characters were developed instantly, and the sentences drew me in. the prose was actually pretty good. aside from the sex, it was a cute book and a fun lighthearted read.<br /><br />yeah, it's got some sex in it. i mean, c'mon. it's about chemistry between the two most unlikely people, and a guy who makes a bet to his friends that he'll sleep with the girl by thanksgiving... but whatever. it actually wasn't too bad. (though i could tell a lot about the author's morals. or lack thereof. )<br /><br />the first paragraph in the book is: \\"Everyone knows I'm perfect. my life is perfect. my cloths are perfect. even my family is perfect. and although it's a complete lie, I've worked my butt off to keep up the appearance that I have it all.\\" I mean, that pretty much develops a character instantly, doesn't it? Poor Brittany is trying to please everyone (except herself) by attempting to live up to her family's standards. the problem is, her mom's standards are perfection. Alex is a gang member struggling through growing up, and makes a bet out of pride--but then realizes that Brittany is a real person, not just a sex object.<br /><br />the end was pretty sweet, haha, i read it twice it was so cute.<br /><br />I'd have to go with these ratings:<br />storyline: 3/5<br />prose/sentences/grammar etc: 3.5-4ish/5<br />characters: 5/5<br /><br />but again, sap city, people.<br />the weak points of this book:<br />the sex<br />the language<br />the sappy sappy sappy.<br /><br />I realize this isn't my best review, but I'm trying to keep it honest here.<br /><br />[...]

0385504225|3.0|I just finished reading the \\"Lost Symbol\\" and I have to say, this book is nothing like \\"The DaVinci Code\\" and   \\"Angels and Demons\\".  It was hard to get into, so many repetitions and I was glad when I was done.  It was a bore compared to the other two books.  I truly struggled to get through it,
0385504225|1.0|I just finished reading \\"The Lost Symbol.\\" And yes, in its favor is that I not only finished reading it, I did so in two days. (You know the way you remove a Band-Aid by yanking it off in one quick motion, rather than peel it off slowly and prolong the pain? 'Nuff said.)    First, I have to say that I think many modern American readers will enjoy this book immensely. It proposes more half-baked theories based in self-importance and elitism than any book in years. While the surface setting of the novel may be Washington, D.C., the real setting is -- as always in his books -- a secret society that believes itself privy to secrets that the rabble are not aware of, and furthermore believes itself more entitled to lead the rabble and shape the world because of its knowledge of those secrets.    The secret society in this case is Masonry. And there is no question that, factually, Masons have been \\"movers and shakers\\" in Western society for centuries. Whether their beliefs and their tendency to dress up in funny clothes and perform odd rituals involving the mimicking of death and drinking from skulls did anything to enhance their ability to be movers or shakers or was just elitist hubris and spiritual cross-dressing, the fact remains that a lot of the world's movers and shakers were Masons. The thing to remember in my opinion -- both when evaluating the impact of Masonry on the world and this novel -- is that a much larger percentage of them weren't.    If you've read any Dan Brown novel in the past, I don't have to tell you about the plot. A flamboyant villain (the albino priest from \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" wasn't flashy enough, so this novel has a villain who has covered almost every square inch of his body with tattoos ) tries to do something dastardly, related to a secret society. Professor Robert Langdon steps in to save the day. The plot seems to involve supernatural events, but resolves itself in the most mundane way imaginable, without the need for any supernatural oresoteric explanation whatsoever. All of the characters spend the entire book talking like docents, spewing an almost unendurable plethora of facts at you, few of which are actually necessary or relevant. Langdon still doesn't get laid. And most important, even though the plot doesn't actually rely on *any* of the supernatural or esoteric facts Brown has his characters spew at you, and as a reader there is no need to believe a word of the esoteric stuff, after resolving the plot Brown spends an additional 50 pages trying to get you, the reader, to believe in all the esoteric stuff ANYWAY. It's almost as if he ends the book by justifying spending six years writing it.    That said, it's a fast read and a veritable page-turner. If you *enjoy* spiritual elitism and conspiracy theories, you might enjoy being preached to by the literary equivalent of Cliff Claven from \\"Cheers\\" for 500 pages. Just don't ask tough questions like how the smartest scientists in the world and the leader of the Masonic Order in Washington, D.C. haven't figured out how to use a flashlight, rather than walk over and over through a pitch-black room.
B002P7UCMC|3.0|It's still a solid album, but it's not up to par with Reise Reise, Mutter, or even Sensucht. It's different than Rosenrot, which some people might think is a good change (personally I don't like it as much as Rosenrot either) but it's not, by any means, \\"classic\\" Rammstein either. In fact with the exception of two or three tracks, the entire album feels slightly forced and a little bit sloppy. As if it were thrown together with the \\"ok guys, they didn't like Rosenrot so we have to try to be heavier\\"  attitude without them actually \\"feeling\\" heavier about the album.    Maybe it will grow on me over time. It's still much better than what most bands are putting out, but it just feels almost too commercialized or something. I don't know, I can't put my finger on it but not too much about this one really sticks out to me. Get it if you're a Rammstein fan or a metal fan, but don't gush about \\"classic\\" Rammstein or expect \\"classic\\" Rammstein, because this isn't quite it.
B001974DG0|5.0|I've always been a Koontz fan, but this is as good as it gets.  He manages to create three characters ( one of which is a dog ), that readers genuinely care about.  Mix in a government science project run amok, a violent product of said project, and a violent sociopath, and Koontz serves up a story which pulls you along to the very end.  Highly recommended.
0882709194|1.0|This is not a worthwhile 150th Anniversary Edition for any book. It's abridged and it contains a long introduction that has little to do with the work itself. I would wholly recommend anyone looking for an anniversary edition of any book to look for an unabridged version, or at least one that contains some sort of inserts, forwards, and opinions by individuals educated on the subject who present in part what we've learned in the past 150 years on the subject in fact and science rather than uninformed opinion.
B0011FDVKE|2.0|I am honestly suprised to see such positive reviews of this album. Where Bramble Rose was urgent and engaging, and Tambourine can rightfully claim to be a landmark album I would place up there with Tapestry as a classic in the female singer/songwriter genre, I found Another Country to be self-absorbed and tedious. In the process of moving to Paris to \\"discover herself\\", or whatever other self-indulgent artistic reason she had for doing it, Tift managed to completely lose sight of the musical and cultural roots that drove her music. I can only hope that making Another Country helped Tift find what she was looking for on a personal level, because she completely fails to make any connection whatsoever with this particular listener - all she managed to do was bore me.<br /><br />Readers would be much better off turning to something recent by Kathleen Edwards or Sarah Harmer.

Many years on, the AIC machine runs stronger and better than ever with 'Black Gives Way to Blue'. This is by far their most mature album to date... and by that i mean that the band has matured... in every sense of the word - lyrically, skillfully etc. There's a dominant air of gloom surrounding the sound of the album which is perfect. In my opinion, DuVall fits in absolutely well and i'm sure others would agree that he brings and holds his own. His voice adds the different flavour to the album. On the tracks, boy there's a lot to love. My fave's include - Last of my kind, Your decision, Lesson Learned, Take her out, Check my brain. There's a grungy, sludgy sound to the entire album which is how i like my AIC. Long live... and keep it coming!

B000RIWAVW|5.0|For those of you who may not have seen this movie yet or maybe just dont own it well let me tell you it is one of if not the best horror films of all time and obviously a classic.  What I like about this movie is the story it was a very good story but dosent have to much that it hinders the hack and slashness that you expect in horror films.  Films like Friday the 13th for instense altho I loved the first Friday the 13th it had some faults in that you really didnt understand what was going on until the end when jasons mom randomly showed up(very good ending though) and like alot of horror films the acting can pretty much for lack of a better word suck Halloween however has it all a good story some good(but not to over the top)kills and GOOD ACTORS which is nice to see.  For those of you who enjoyed Rob Zombies version of the first film you have to see the original I love Rob and I loved his version but Carpenter is just a genius who cant be beat.  This movie is a much own for horror fans in fact if you are a horror fan you should already own it but if you dont BUY IT. WATCH IT. LOVE IT.  and also check out the rest of the series I personaly own the entire series(minus Halloween 3 cause honestly what was that was it even a Halloween Film)altho some people would say the plot gets lame after the first one I would disagree maybe after the 5th but there still even H20 and Reserection where a fun watch and Rob Zombies are not at all shabby ether in fact id go as far as to say Rob Zombies Halloween is the second best in the series next to the original first movie.  But hey im rambeling but take it from me a true Halloween fan who even owns the so called crappy ones Halloween is amazing atleast give the first two a shot if you have yet to
0061730327|4.0|It's easy to say a book \\"isn't just about [insert subject]\\" but The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind really is not just about the William Kamkwamba's windmill. The windmill doesn't even come to fruition until about two hundred pages in. The majority of the book is about William's life as a child and the culture of his homeland in Malawi (Africa), which at times is depressing - his family lives with the bare minimum, they survive a famine, and William wasn't able to attend school due to financial constraints. If you can't express pity for these people, you aren't human.<br /><br />The details of farming, magic (yes, magic as in wizardry and curses), and everything else surrounding William's life is dragged out a bit more than necessary, but it makes the \\"feel good\\" aspect that much more appreciated in the end. Having virtually no schooling or money, William toyed with the intricacies of electricity and ultimately constructed a working windmill. Most adults with a college education probably couldn't pull this off! This boy had nothing and now he has worldwide recognition, not to mention electricity in his home.

B00003CX5P|4.0|Yes, my main gripe, like many fans of the franchise, is Jake Lloyd. But to surprise a few people, I have no problems with Jar Jar Binks. He doesn't bother me in any way when I watch it. Do I think he was a little over the top? Yes. Do I think he, along with the Neimoidians, are racial stereotypes of Jamaicans and Asians respectively? No. The story is good but it can plod along at a very sluggish pace. For instance, once the story gets to Tatooine, they could've trimmed a few scenes, the Podrace imparticular. And some scenes on Coruscant feel slow as well, like the pointless scenes of watching Palpatine take the Queen to her apartment suite. Its brief but un-necessary. Liam Neeson does an admirable job as Qui-Gon, portraying him as a caring yet very formidable warrior. Ewan McGregor portrays Obi-Wan as a young, headstrong Jedi. The character at least goes through development over the course of the prequel trilogy and he'll eventually become the character from the \\"first\\" (fourth) film. Natalie Portman is alright as Queen Amidala but she's no Princess Leia. Though her hairdos can outdo Leia's and both are good with a blaster, the way the character's acted out comes across as wooden and stiff. And when Portman actually is the Queen, where does that deep, accented way of speaking come from? Is that Keira Knightley dubbing her voice when she's in the Queen's clothes? I don't know. And then there's Jake Lloyd, who's able to take the concept of what Anakin is to become in the future and make the character less intimidating. To know that in Vader's youth, he was prone to shout \\"Yipee!\\" and be called \\"Ani\\". That's not very threatening! Though I will give him credit for at least trying, its just that they did not capture the best (if there is any) performances of the actor and I'm pretty sure Lucas and the producers could've done A LOT better. There are some familiar faces from the original movies; Kenny Baker as R2-D2 (not much has changed over the course of six films) and his first meeting with a pre-gold plated C-3PO (still played by Anthony Daniels) and Ian McDiarmid as Senator (later Supreme Chancellor) Palpatine and his sinister alter ego, Darth Sidious. Darth Maul is a formidable villain for the film, though there always seems to be a co-villain in the newer films instead of just one singular villain, but I guess for all six you can count the Emperor as an over-arching villain, but I digress. And there are cameos by a young Jabba the Hutt, some Wookies in the Senate scene and General Zod himself, Terence Stamp as Supreme Chancellor Vallorum. The fight scenes are some the best, the four different fights at the climax being the standout. And its time for to once again praise John Williams. The man can do no wrong it seems as the music is just fantastic. My favorite set pieces being Duel of the Fates and the space fight. And The Imperial March is incorporated into Anakin's theme, forshadowing the fate the character will meet.is first meeting with a pre-gold plated C-3PO (still played by Anthony Daniels) and Ian McDiarmid as Senator (later Supreme Chancellor) Palpatine and his sinister alter ego, Darth Sidious.

1401300529|4.0|I found it hard to put this book down, so masterful is Halberstram's unique style, which shifts effortlessly from individual stories of soldiers in battle to deft portraits of the commanders to welcome historical background.  It is absolutely riveting.  However, it inspired me to read more on the Korean War and Douglas MacArthur in particular.  In his effort to make MacArthur the villain of the book, Halberstram ignores or pays short shrift to anything that might undercut his argument.  He glosses over or fails to report any conflicting view and concentrates on the General's mistakes, while, except for Inchon, ignoring his tactical successes and personal heroism.  For example, he portrays as idiocy MacArthur's venturing past the narrow waist of Korea while pursuing the retreating North Korean army, instead of establishing a defensive line.  This ignores contemporary and current military agreement that MacArthur lacked the troops necessary for a defense in depth and that the terrain at the 'waist' was unsuitable for the sort of manuevers he might be called upon to maintain that line should the North Koreans regroup and attack. MacArthur felt he had little choice but to pursue and destroy the North Koreans, not to mention fulfill the UN Mandate to reunify the peninsula (to which Halberstram gives short shrift).  However, many of MacArthur's subsequent actions during this pursuit were unforgivable, as Halberstram reports.    I highly recommend this book, but suggest it be balanced with additional reading on the subject.
0385342020|3.0|I'm a loyal fan of Sophie Kinsella, despite the fact that for me, many of her latest books are not as good as the first two in the Shopaholic series.  While this book was not one of my favorites, I found that I actually enjoyed reading it in the end.    The premise of [[ASIN:0385342020 Twenties Girl: A Novel]] is that Lara Lington, the main character, is haunted by the ghost of her great aunt Sadie, who she did not have a relationship with when she was alive.  Sadie is following Lara because her prized necklace has gone missing and she cannot rest without it.  The remainder of the book follows the hillarity that ensues when Lara goes on a hunt for the necklace and Sadie seems keen to intervene in her everyday life.    For the first 100 pages of this book I didn't like it at all and considered putting it down.  The writing didn't seem believable (True, the premise is unlikely to begin with, but many authors have a way of making the unbelievable seem believable) and I really didn't have a sense of why Sadie chose Lara or why I should care.  Eventually though I got sucked in and ended up enjoying the book.  Yes, there were quite a few elements of the plot that were predictable and a bit contrived.  However, the characters ended up being well developed enough and there were enough twists and turns in the plot that it still made for a fun read.    The bottom line is this.  This definitely is not Sophie Kinsella's best book and if you are reading her for the first time I would definitely recommend picking up the first book in the Shopaholic series first.  However, if you've already read the series and are looking to branch out to later books this is definitely one of the best of the books she has written after the series.  It's not going to rock your socks off, but it's still pretty good as a breezy read.
B001FB55I0|2.0|I didn't necessarily have high hopes for this film, but I didn't shun it at first sight either. It had rather strong casting, and with Christian Bale in it, I figured it could be very surprisingly good, since about every film he is in gets rather good reviews by critics, but I am afraid this one was a miss fire by Bale. Throughout the movie, you can almost see it in his eyes, that he knows how horrible the movie is. By the way he communicates with everyone in the movie, you can almost hear him saying, \\"Why the heck am I in this film? The plot is extremely linear and boring, the script is very poorly written and is even more poorly executed by the actors, and why is my character suppose to be such a wimp? I'm John Connor! I am suppose to be the last bad-A left in this God-forsaken war, yet I act like I am a pre-pubescent teenager!\\" I believe these realizations are the cause of his notorious fiasco on the set of Terminator Salvation.

B0016Q2D5M|3.0|Please note that I watched this on my LCD TV on the HBO channel so I can't speak to the quality of the 3D, but after reading several of the reviewers here who know something about it, it looks like I didn't miss anything since they say the polarized 3D method that was used wasn't that good.<br /><br />But I thought the movie itself was great for the spectacular special effects. Some are eerily beautiful, like the phosphorescent pools and the luminescent birds. The CGI animation, such as in the chase with the tyranosaurus, is also outstanding. The movie only loosely sticks to the original book, but then most people don't know the original book anyway. (I don't either, I only read 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, which is the more popular of the two books).<br /><br />By the way, a little trivia here, Verne originally got started writing westerns, only set in South America, oddly enough, but later turned to writing sci-fi, which is what he's best known for.<br /><br />The acting is also fine and Brendan Fraser projects a sort of goofy benevolence and exasperatedness which gives him an engaging on-screen presence--actually very similar to Cary Grant in many of his movies. He'll probably never be considered a truly great actor like Grant because of the movies he's been in, but he brings something to his roles that perhaps no one else but Grant did.<br /><br />So overall a fun CGI and special effects filled romp that, while nothing profound, is still worth watching for the stunning visuals and also suitable for the whole family.

B000002JSR|4.0|I don't understand why so many people, casual and hardcore Zeppelin fans alike, hate this album.  Yes, it is a last-ditch effort to put together some unreleased tracks and make some more money after John died and the band broke up.  But who cares?  Releasing \\"previously unreleased\\" material is commonplace today, I just view Zeppelin as pioneers in that respect (along with pioneering many other things in rock music).<br /><br />The point here is that the music is GOOD.  In my opinion, Coda is better than several of their earlier efforts.  Sure, there are a few duds, but there are a few gems too, namely \\"Ozone Baby\\" and \\"Darlene\\".  I am also a big fan of \\"Bonzo's Montreux\\", in which the entire song is a killer drum solo, although I do understand that 4 minute drum solos are not everyone's cup of tea.<br /><br />Honestly, I think this is just one of those situations where so many people have \\"heard\\" that it is really bad so many times that they start to believe it themselves and decide to hate it before they really give it a chance.  The usual reaction to me is \\"What...you actually LIKE Coda?!\\", \\"Nobody likes Coda!\\"  Well I do, and I like it alot.  Give it a chance and you may too go against the flow and decide you like it!
B002P7UCMC|5.0|Let me start of by saying that I have loved every Rammstein album even though some have taken time to grow on me. I got into the band when I was younger... 11 years ago and at that time Herzeleid and Sehnsucht were perfection. I loved the heavier and faster stuff back then. When Mutter came out I wasn't sure of it as it was a little slower but it after a few weeks of listening the album eclipsed Rammsteins first two releases. I loved the epic quality of each track. The slower tracks really had a quality not seen before and it just made the album feel a lot more solid through out. I got a little older and my taste in music mellowed and the heavier stuff just didn't have the same feel. I still love Herzelied and Sehnsucht but after Mutter I had seen what a more rhythmic Rammstein could do.<br /><br />Then came Reise, Reise and I loved it. But like before it took a little while for me to realize its quality. Don't get me wrong Rammstein was as heavy as before but they were now experimenting with ballads and me being a little older really appreciated that. Not every song needs to be a head banger. Ohne Dich really demonstrates how Rammstein can put out an epic ballad. It is a perfect track... my favorite track of all their albums. Mein Teil also shows that Rammstein didn't forget about thier earlier work and its just shows they can rock out when they want to.<br /><br />Rosenrot, an album that you either hate or love, I think gets an unfair rep. Its an album that just shows that Rammstein are a little older now and not every track needs to be a Ich Will Flamen Sehen. I loved the album personally. It has more ballad's then their previous work and I like that a lot. I don't need so much heaviness all the time. Its an album that relaxes me.<br /><br />Now with the release of Liebe Ist Fure Alle Da Rammstein have combined the best of their works. You have the tracks that harken back to Herzeleid and Sehnsucht, tracks that bring about the emotional rawness of Mutter and the ballads of Reise, Reise and Rosenrot. It is a great album through and through. Every track is just great. This one took no time for me to really get into. Every track could be a potential single. My favorite is actually on the bonus CD; Fuhre Mich. The chorus is enchanting and the guitar riffs really get you pumped. Tracks like Ich Tu Dir Wen and Waidmanns Heil remind you of the earlier and rawer Rammstein. While tracks like Donaukinder remind you of Mutter with the emotional quality.<br /><br />This is just a great album by a great band.se and Rosenrot. It is a great album through and through. Every track is just great. This one took no time for me to really get into. Every track could be a potential single. My favorite is actually on the bonus CD; Fuhre Mich.

B002P7UCMC|5.0|There aren't many albums this strong that I have come across in my life. This is powerful music that rocks, and is amazingly melodic. Stranger still, there is a touch of humor to this masterpiece that make it one of the most compelling albums that I've ever heard.<br /><br />Simply put, every track is well constructed, perfectly executed, and is enjoyable on first, second, and third listens. Complex layers and easy to listen to? This is just great hard rock/metal.<br /><br />I have noticed that a lot of bands from the 1990's have put out some solid music in the last five years; Garbage, Weezer, Tori Amos, Smashing Pumpkins, Oasis, and Green Day to name a few. And it seems like the new bands in this area can't quite hit the right spot. That's okay, because we have some great music from Rammstein and other bands like the ones I listed.<br /><br />\\"Liebe Ist Fur Alle Da\\" is as good, if not better, than any other release that Rammstein has put out. On the first listen, it was clear that this album was making a bid for my favorite from the six albums. It has only grown with each listen.<br /><br />The intros are some of the most unigue, and the whistling ('Engel') is back in a whole new way. The band members really get to show their stuff - every one. The keyboards, guitars, bass, drums, and vocals just blow me way. Every aspect of their previous stuff has built up to this.<br /><br />If you like Rammstein, and great hard rock/metal in general, I don't see how you won't dig this album.<br /><br />Highly recomended for folks who like to rock out, and for those who love melody.
B002JM1VJG|4.0|In reading the reviews posted on Amazon about how poorly this DVD was made. I was like wow can it be that bad? I am a true Madonna fan from way back in the day and continue to be a \\"True Blue\\" Fan. First...It is not bad at all visual and the audio. I bought the Greatest hits CD first and a voice in my head said...you have all this and then some at home, just return the CD for the DVD, but after reading some of the reviews on here, I was thinking about not getting the DVD at all. HEADLINE: I can tell you I am happy with  exchange for the DVD. It is what it is. No complaints at all!!!! If you don't have all main video's get it and enjoy it! Be a fan not a critic.  Celebrate life not hate!
0307454541|1.0|I have to agree with the negative reviewers. I wanted to like this novel, to get lost in a good mystery. If that's what you want, try \\"The Big Picture,\\" by Kennedy.<br /><br />I came to a point in the \\"Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" when I wanted to shout, \\"GET ON WITH THE STORY!\\" It might have hooked me if about 150 pages were edited out. It would be a good 300-page novel. At 450, it's just too long.
B002P7UCMC|5.0|All i have to say is that Rammstein are growing with there music.All there albums are great pieces of work.  But when i heard that they were coming out with a new album i was a bit comprehensive about the idea that they   might run out of material.I just got my cd today and every song in the album were great.A bit on the softer side,like they did previously with Rosenrot.But great...Rock on Rammstein.

Also, it's worth noting that this adapter does provide power to Firewire 400 peripherals just as a Firewire 400 port would.

B0006N2EZ0|5.0|If you are looking for a bit of romance and drama, but just on the light side, then The Bodyguard doesn't disappoint. Costner and Houston have great onscreen chemistry. It worked well being that she is a rock star and her life is probably close to most of what we see...hopefully, without the dangerous drama. The storyline has its weak spots but watching Costner and Houston play the game of love/hate/love again makes it worth the time. Of course, Houston's dynamic voice adds to the entire enjoyment of the movie. Couldn't help notice how nice it was to not hear either of them or anyone in the movie mention \\"race\\"...just two people who fell in love. I've seen it a few times and will probably watch it again.
B002GY9F9K|4.0|When Terry wrote to me and told me about this series I was very excited, thinking that it would be a LOTR type of movie.  As the opening television date drew nearer I was looking forward to it.  As luck would have it I was out of the country for the first 2 episodes but read critiques of them.  I was basically told by so many people that if you have read the book you will hate the series.  So, I took their advice and never watched the show.  However, when the first season came out I decided to buy it and watch it as I would any series, not taking the books into consideration.  It was good --- if you approach it that way then it has a good story, continuation, etc.  One of the guys here said that he became a master swordsman overnight --- so who cares???  Do you have no imagination???  I am looking forward to watching the second season once it comes out in DVD --- I hate commercials and would rather watch something like this in one or two sittings.

1932100660|5.0|Merriam-Webster defines the word \\"masterpiece\\" as: \\"a work done with extraordinary skill, especially a supreme intellectual or artistic achievement.\\"      This book is a masterpiece.  Read it and you will understand why.  I finished reading it today.  Halfway through it, I gave up all animal food and animal products.  Then my dad and I had a chat over the phone.    My dad is a colon cancer survivor.  I'm a skin cancer survivor [melanoma].  Here's an exerpt from our conversation:    Dad: I read in the newspaper that eating little meat is good for you.  Me: Your read that in the paper?  Dad: Yeah. It said that there's never been a vegetarian who lived to a hundred.  Me: What about those yogis in India and those monks in Tibet? They are mostly vegetarians and 90% of them live over a hundred.  (Pause)  Dad: Oh, yeah, the yogis. I forgot about them. I guess, you're right.    My dad represents 95% of the population. My dad is neither super smart, nor dumb. He is simply ignorant and misinformed about nutrition. This ignorance kills millions of people every year. It nearly killed him two years ago.    My dad had two surgeries and chemotherapy to get rid of his colon cancer. I had one outpatient surgery and no chemotherapy to kill the melanoma. My dad has been a heavy meat eater all his life. I was a light meat eater and a moderate diary eater. My dad continues to eat animal products. I stopped eating them. He takes drugs on a daily basis for various ailments. I have only dental floss and toothpaste in my medical cabinet. I'll stop here.    Read this book, then buy it for everybody you know. By reading it and changing your dietary habits, you and your friends will receive the best present ever: optimal health for the rest of your lives.

0385340575|3.0|I must be a sucker for a decently constucted paragraph, because I read this all the way through despite not understanding anyone's motivations or caring who lived or died. And now that I've finished it? I still don't.     I recently discovered Reacher and I've liked most of the series, but this one is a goofy old-school-Bond rip-off. Implausible fight scenes. Two-dimensional characters. Mysterious special forces allies. \\"Crises\\" that we have to take on faith. Hot women who aren't what they seem. And all left over from the Cold War! Although, unlike Bond, the sex scene (singular) was strictly perfunctory.       Although Child's antagonists are invariably Bad, they usually have an interesting worldview and backstory. In Gone Tomorrow, however, Child depends on a boring stereotype of Central Asians taken straight from the Soviet/Moscow propaganda department. (He is much better at fleshing out Russians, when he comes across them.) Disappointing. He missed a chance to shed some light on an interesting and relatively unknown part of the world.    Gone Tomorrow is a perfectly acceptable throw-away airplane read but unworthy of the Reacher canon.
B002KDUDG6|4.0|Though I've heard some of Buble before, this is my first time being exposed to an entire album.  My best summation is that it's good.  It's not great; it's not bad.  It's a solid, nice-to-listen-to album.  I've always liked that Buble doesn't seem to have the hubris to believe that he can do better than the legends who made famous the songs he remakes.  The flip side of that is the risk that there will be little point to a remake -- if it's the same as the first, why bother?  In this album, he mostly does a good job of walking the line between those two ideas.  He sticks to the character of the original songs, recognizing the quality therein.  But he (or, perhaps more realistically, his composer/s) also adds a bit of modernization through some creative updates in orchestration.  Some are more significant than others, some more effective than others, but the overall effort is noticeable and appreciated, balancing slightly more modern scores with Buble's fairly traditional vocals.
B0029LHW4U|4.0|So it's 15 years later were all not as depressed as we were in the 1990s.  Go figure.  AIC pulled off a reasonably contemporary album without sacrificing their core sound.  The new singer, William, could have had a little more prominence, but really this is Cantrell's band.  And it works on this record.     While it won't satisfy a minority of AIC purists, it's the best we're going to get.  I don't think this album is good enough to attract any new/younger fans, but I really enjoy it and will continue listening to it.
0061914177|4.0|Gary has really vibrant and enthusiast personality and I am glad that this extend to his book. The language is straightforward, simple, no filler. But.. because of his nature and his successful experience, he like to over exaggerate things. I feel he needs to put himself in other people shoe.<br /><br />The essence of Gary point is, you need to build personal brand through internet social media platform(s) and monetize it. When you read the book, it sounds very simple, but it takes a lot of effort and time to do it. You will also need to be expert or at least very knowledgeable about the subject, if not that you'll be a drop of water in a vast ocean.<br /><br />I like that Gary takes time on writing about pro and cons about platforms and which platform are suitable for each person. But because technology and trend will keep evolving rapidly, this chapter will be soon irrelevant.<br /><br />So, this book is not for everyone. It is perfect especially for young people, who is no stranger to the internet and social media and do not have a lot of responsibility yet (family, kids, mortgage etc). It great for college kids or stay at home mom that looking for something productive to do.<br /><br />Overall, Crush it! is very inspirational and informative. It gives me confidence that I will able to be successful too if I love my family, work hard and live with passion! :)
0061914177|5.0|Gary Vaynerchuk knows social media like nobody's business.  Twitter.  YouTube.  Facebook.  You name it, and he has used it to take his family's wine business from a $4 million company to a $60 million empire.  His new book \\"Crush It\\" tells the story of this immigrant's journey, his road to success, and how he used online marketing to realize the American dream.<br /><br />So what exactly does it mean to crush it?  It's a term used to plan your dream and surpass all expectations by harnessing the power of the Internet to market and sell it.  Vaynerchuk gives tactical instructions on how to use tools like blogs, Flip Cams, and Twitter to build your brand.  The author also shares his experience with traditional advertising versus social media.  For example he writes:<br /><br />\\"In December 2008, I spent $7500 to offer free shipping codes for Winelibrary.com via three marketing/advertising channels---a perfectly placed billboard on the New Jersey Turnpike, direct mail, and radio.  The billboard brought in a hundred and seventy orders.  The radio campaign did about two hundred and forty orders.  Through direct mail we got a little over three hundred.  I Twittered out---for free---a free shipping code and got seventeen hundred orders in forty-eight hours.\\"<br /><br />Vaynerchuk is no hype man though.  He readily admits that it takes hard work, sleepless nights, and patience to build your online brand.  For some adapters in could take months to years to build an audience, get them to trust that you care about them, and convert them to buyers.  His realistic take on building your brand is refreshing.<br /><br />There is a downside though.  Readers who may want to take their business from scratch should not assume that they will create a $60 million dollar company.  Not everyone gets a $4 million dollar start.  Also, we should keep in mind that the dotcom folks were preaching some of the same things regarding the end of traditional media and the beginning of something new and wonderful before the dotcom bubble burst and the NASDAQ crashed.  In today's economy, adapters need more proof that if you build it and they will come.<br /><br />All in all, if you care about the future of marketing, selling, or becoming an entrepreneur, you will love this book.  Vaynerchuk is personal, humorous, and speaks from personal experiences.  His teachings are all you really need to master leveraging social media to your advantage.<br /><br />Reviewed by Emanuel Carpenter<br />Author of the Amazon.com Bestseller \\"How to Dominate in Cold Calling & Earn Six Figures Doing It\\"nd wonderful before the dotcom bubble burst and the NASDAQ crashed.

B0025UHKNS|5.0|First and foremost, do not expect to be able to just put it on and it will work properly. Like anything that costs a bit more, you have to read the instructions. So if you cannot follow directions then you will have a heck of a time trying to use it. I took it on a test run just so I could get a feel for it.     The only problem I had with it was that it wasn't connecting to the satelites in order for the GPS to work. I had to go back in and re-read the instructions.     *Note- If you want to use the GPS, make sure the power save mode is off because that mode interferes with the satelites.*     Once I figured out the satelites, it took several minutes for the watch to locate them, which kind of sucks if its cold outside. You have to stand still until it picks up on the satelites.    Also, make sure the GPS is turned off while you are inside because it will try to connect to the satelites and use up your battery life.    There are so many neat features on this watch but what I thought was so cool was auto-pause setting. This feature will pause your watch if you get below a certain speed. This is good for when you are at stoplights.     I also liked how the watch is set up to transmit your watch data wirelessly. Once transmitted, you can go on garmin connect and view your results.     This is a complicated device, but once you have it all set up and figured out, it's very easy to use. I really recommend this watch to anyone who wants something that will help them with their training and to track their progress.

B000A5044C|4.0|The film is based on a true story in Japan, 1988 where a heartless mother abandoned her children in an apartment.  In most cases where film depicts true life, the film story is more sensualized.  But here, according to reports of the true incident, the real life \\"Affair of the Abandoned Children of Sugamo.\\" is much more grim.<br /><br />Nobody Knows, filmed in 2004, takes place in Japan where a young mother of four tells the children she is out of town working and leaves the children to fend for themselves, for months or forever.  Initially, mother and eldest son rent an apartment, but she sneaks the other children into the apartment. The other three are never to go outside, nor attend school.  She tramps around, then leaves.<br /><br />From a Boy to a Man to a Boy to a Man<br />The pre-teen boy is suddenly thrust into manhood, as we see him dutifully budget the money left to him, paying rent, buying food.  He is the man of the house, until temptations of childhood take over and as a young boy indulges on games and nonsense with friends.  Then, as the money and friends go, he tries to earn money to support his siblings, the role of a man.<br /><br />Although the movie is 2 1/2 hours long, the pace slow; it is necessary to depict the length of time these children are alone, fending for themselves.  Some feel it could have been cut considerably.  Dialogue is minimal and soundtrack low key.  It won several awards.<br /><br />What is depicted in the film does not ring true to \\"survival.\\" We get the feeling that their life is not in too much despair.  The children do not appear \\"neglected\\" and it doesn't quite come across as months of solitude without proper supervision and care.

0061537969|5.0|I cannot remember a time when a book affected me so profoundly. The Art of Racing in the Rain is destined to be an inspirational classic - like the Alchemist (another favourite of mine) - only so much better. It's odd how a canine narrator can pierce the very depths of your soul  - but perhaps it's because he was a dog and not a human that he was able to do so. This book is unbelievably clever, moving, witty, poignant and heartbreaking. I cried more than I ever cried reading any book - yet the tears were not out of sadness but because the story and its lessons were so beautiful. And so seeped in wisdom. Garth Stein is a genius who has shown us all how much we can learn from our canine cousins.
B000002VQQ|5.0|I saw Patti Smith a couple times at the old Capitol Theatre in Passaic and, to loosely quote John Lennon, it was like being a Roman in Rome during Roman times. I know how lucky I was. There are a few people whose work I love as much as hers... but not many. These are great albums, and her music still sounds great and largely undated. That breathless stretch of Land in Horses is one of my favorite moments in all of rock n' roll. Really, why aren't we hearing more of this stuff now?? They play everything else!
0061134007|4.0|A mighty impressive novel. It interweaves the circa-2000 timeframe with a plot thread set in World War II on the Eastern Front, where many men from Norway volunteered to fight on behalf of the Nazis.    I greatly admire Nesbo's protagonist, Harry Hole, an alcoholic police investigator, yet one who doesn't seem quite like any other one we've known. He's emotionally complex and very much open to finding the right woman, and he is close friends with his female police partner, if a bit needy. I also appreciated the book's look at how Naziism held and for some still holds appeal in Norwegian culture, something I wasn't aware of. The mood of the book is pure noir, with bureaucracy and corruption just beneath the surface at every turn, frustrating our hero and the other moral characters of the book. Also, the hero's Ford Escort won't reliably start (and for some reason, he won't take it to a mechanic).    The plot is monstrously complex, and the book is more than 500 pages long, so this story is quite demanding on the reader. As the Washington Post reviewer pointed out, many of the Norwegian names sound similar, so it can be easy to get confused, especially when you haven't seen either Signe or Sindre for 50 pages. Also, the cast is massive, so there are a lot of people to remember. You may find yourself flipping back and forth a fair bit. This slows you down in getting through the story and may rob you of (or at least delay) a few ah-ha moments.    The fact that Nesbo safely lands this 747 of a plot at all is remarkable. However, he does rely on several convenient coincidences to make it all work, self-consciously so, it would seem. Check out this bit of dialogue:  \\"Yes, life throws up bizarre coincidences,\\" Rakel said.  \\"So bizarre that you would never get away with it in fiction, anyway.\\" (Harry said.)  \\"You don't know the half of it, Harry.\\"    I think the plot got a little overgrown and would probably have benefited from being somewhat simpler. Also, the way the mainplot thread resolves seems as if it would have catastrophic effects on the romantic subplot and that Harry would realize so, but we get no inkling of this.    In the end, though, this book definitely rewards your investment of money, time and intellectual energy. And I'm now primed for NEMESIS, about which I've heard so many good things.

B001V9LPWQ|3.0|Side-by-side, I watched the Blu-ray disc of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs along with the regular DVD included in the Diamond Edition released in October 2009.  Was the contrast between the Blu-ray and the original movie obvious? Yes. But, is the enhancement an improvement?<br /><br />I am all for progress but as I watched the two versions together, although my eyes were drawn to the Blu-ray version for the vivid colors and clarity, there were definite problems with the changes. The colors are so bright that the misty original now looks like a current cartoon/animated feature instead of an old classic -- cheapened by the process rather than enriched. The original is filmed with a diffused gauzy sensibility in muted colors in both the background and foreground - a perfect balance and an expected setting for a fairy tale with a lovely princess, dwarfs, a wicked queen and a handsome prince.<br /><br />In places on the disc, the Blu-ray contains inconsistent color enhancement.  One scene - Snow White and the woodland creatures cleaning the dwarfs' home is a good example of the uneven application of the color saturation. The characters are harshly colorized in comparison to the subtle background - to the degree that it reminded me of a colorized classic black and white film where the backgrounds often remain in black and white and only the foregrounds are tinted. The dwarfs' mine scene is another example of the problem. So, parts of the movie are noticeably out-of-balance. The original looks like a work of art and the new version looks, although vividly colored, of lesser over-all quality and depth.<br /><br />It is great to have both versions, and the extras are terrific, but sometimes \\"improvements\\" this drastic have the opposite affect and end-up detracting.
B0029O08WA|5.0|This is a definite upgrade from the Twilight OST, in my opinion. The songs are downright haunting, and 'The Meadow' composed by Alexandre Desplat is gorgeous. I think people are just disappointed with this one because it didn't feature more mainstream artists-- this just goes to show you don't have to be a big name to compose amazing music. If you're a fan of the saga or a fan of good music, this is definitely the soundtrack for you.
0765356139|5.0|This story really pulls you in, I don't remember the last time I was so into a book.  I read this one in just a few days.  If there's on criticism that I can level against it, I would have to say that the conclusion of the trilogy was disappointing.  Don't let that stop you though, the first two and most of the third are really great.
0385504225|5.0|Dan Brown once again titillates his reader's intellect while distracting him/her with a thrilling sequence of fictional events.  Brown seems to have further developed his world-renowned faculty for juxtaposing the quagmires of history with the cliffhangers and enigmas of the modern world.  The Secret Code is a \\"must read\\" for the new-age, avant-garde bookworm.  Brown is by no means a paragon of the literary realm, but with an intriguing tone and crptic style he excels upon the reader's cognizance. Brown's The Lost Symbol is a successful attempt to awaken the masses from the deep slumber of social and cultural relativism.  Freemasonry in America, ancient mysticism, and noetic sciences are all unique in themselves, but woven together make for a much more interesting tale.
B002MW50KO|5.0|I bought 2 of these cds. One for myself and one as a gift.  I absolutely love it.  Granted I love almost all Christmas music. I just think it's a bit of Americana, a man who might get up in a small town church to sing carols just because he feels the joy of the season. I would recommend this to anyone who likes home town Christmas carols. Regardless of age, not only will boomers like this but my friend from work(26)put it in the car deck when going shopping with me. One note of warning, Bob is pushing 70 and can't hit the high notes anymore. That only adds to the charm. BTW, was he a fan of Betty Page? This is who is on the inside cover, right?  I know she passed earlier this year.
B000PKX2KA|4.0|I bought this GPS receiver \\"flying blind\\" - I had little time and no experience. So I bought it through Amazon (from a Camera outfit in NYC), and it arrived really quickly. I didn't really know how it would work with my netbook computer and the GPS software that I had. It took me a few minutes to figure out how to set it up the first time, and then set up the com port (the default port wasn't the right one), but it wasn't too hard.  Then I let it look for satelites - which took over 15 minutes.  But when I fired up the GPS software, it worked the first time, and I have no issues with it whatsoever.  I don't know if it drains the battery or not... one time it seemed to, and the next  it didn't.  I've only used it a few times, but I'm quite satisfied with it.

0786838655|5.0|I have a reluctant reading 6th grader and a precocious Kinder - trying to read to them both simultaneously is on par with walking into a hungry lion's den with tofu. It's not likely to work out unless it's a highly engaging feast for the brain and ears - one of those books that you slip into and let your imagination push the boundaries of the story and make it your own. Rick Riordan pulls that off with this book - as evinced by the rampant dinnertime discussion of which Greek god is best.<br /><br />Percy (Perseus) Jackson is an immensely sympathetic and familiar character. A 6th grade boy with ADHD with a punk of a step-Dad and suffering from chronic feelings of failure from the never-pleased adults in his circle (save his Mom and one teacher). It turns out the ADHD and his dyslexia was a sign that Percy is really a half-god destined to read Ancient Greek and battle mythical creatures like minotaurs and Medusa.<br /><br />The sobering/mature themes in this book include loss of a parent, parent abandonment, affairs, step-parent issues and feelings of \\"IT'S NOT FAIR!\\" (also known as \\"you never believe me\\"). They are handled admirably, and I would think most children will recognize bits and pieces of themselves in Percy. The rest of the children are shockingly ordinary. It's pretty cool to see a completely realistic kid that has everything stacked against him be the hero for once.<br /><br />The plot is at times fast moving and at other times slow. However, I think Riordan crafts a careful balance between weaving a visual story that you can see in your head (and on the Silver Screen shortly) and grinding to a halt.<br /><br />Chapter names: Riordan - if you ever read this (yeah, right) - this is where your genius shows. No Chapter 1, 2, 3 here. No, no, no. He gives kids a taste of what is in store for them leaving them eager to read on with clever chapter names like \\"Grover Unexpectedly Loses His Pants\\", \\"We Visit the Garden Gnome Emporium\\", and \\"A God Buys Us Cheeseburgers\\".<br /><br />Reading level: I vote ages 10-12. The book has an AR level of 4.7; however I take issue with that. #1 The names! Oh my! I had to look some of these up, and others were aided by the fact my 6th grader is learning about Ancient Greece right now. The names alone will cause many children trouble. The book is also long - although much more accessible in terms of length and detail than Harry Potter was. I would say for independent reading - 6th grade (which works well since many kids cover Ancient Greece at this grade AND this is Percy's age). A strong 5th grade reader should do fine.<br /><br />Interest level: 6-13. The interest level is a completely different story. My 5 year old and 11 year old are equally enthralled. I am not the slightest embarrassed to say I also loved it - although I do not feel the need to act out the scenes or dress up to go see the movie (sorry, kids - this is not on par with LOTR for me).<br /><br />Bottom line: Most definitely recommend the series - ESPECIALLY if your child is covering Ancient Greece b/c in my home this woke my child up to Social Studies actually, possibly, definitely being interesting. My son (who has insultingly referred to reading time as torture time) actually begged to read this book and would whine to read more. Huzzah!ote ages 10-12.

1594488878|5.0|This book was hard to put down.  It has so much going for it:  laugh-out-loud funny parts, poignant soul searching on the nature of parenthood and loneliness, pop culture musings about fame and internet cult sites, a museum exhibit featuring a shark's eye, and Northern soul dancing (who knew???).  Hornby has created a charming community, peopled with fully developed main characters and many interesting minor ones. When I wasn't laughing, I was smiling.  It's right up there with \\"High Frdelity\\" as the best of Hornby.  I would love to see this made into a movie starring John Cusack as Duncan.
B002RDGR2I|3.0|This is hardly their best work. I am a huge fan of this band and the last two albums are 5 stars for sure. This new one is totally different. If you are the type that insists bands change for every album then this may be for you. I on the other hand think they had a great sound going and don't understand why they would tamper with it. This is very electronic with almost no guitar which was their strength. I don't get the new sound at all, I will be waiting for the next one to see if they go back or not. I hope they do go back to guitar because the new sterile electronic sound is just not where their strength is at. So keep the faith and maybe this was just an experiment..!
B000Z27HLS|2.0|Northanger Abbey is my least favorite of all of Austen's books, so it's probably not surprising that I wasn't too intrigued by this adaptation of it. The actors are likable enough and capture the characters well--especially JJ Feild as Henry Tilney. But because the movie didn't establish enough Gothic atmosphere at Northanger Abbey, nor create enough mystery about the fate of Mrs. Tilney, it's hard to understand where Catherine's fancies come from. The whole movie seemed rather rushed and incomplete--but I see from another commenter that this DVD is a cut version of the TV drama, which probably explains it. Overall, I wasn't too impressed.
0882709194|1.0|First off, this edition is abridged.  Second, Ray Comfort, the man who abridged this and wrote the forward, thinks that our failure to find a \\"crocoduck\\" is devastating evidence against evolution being true.  Ironically, he left out the chapter in Origin where Darwin explains that we shouldn't look for direct links: \\"So with natural species, if we look to forms very distinct, for instance to the horse and tapir, we have no reason to suppose that links ever existed directly intermediate between them, but between each and an unknown common parent (3rd paragraph of the original chaper 9: On the Imperfection of the Geological Record).    Rather than confronting the actual evidence for the sort of transitional fossils we do have, Ray resorts to questions such as this: \\"Did we find the millions of transitional forms that would be expected with evolution?\\"  The real answer is \\"yes.\\"  But he answers himself by bringing up hoaxes and implying other fossils are hoaxes, or by commenting how scientists think some fossils are transitional but, hey, what do scientists really know?  That, combined with quotemines, is his entire argument.    In talking about the difference between \\"micro-\\" and \\"macroevolution,\\" he says things like this: \\"Evolution opponents argue that [inferring macroevolution from microevolution] would be a bit like observing a car going from 0 to 60 mph in 60 seconds, and inferring that it can therefore go 0 to 6,000 mph in 100 minutes--and become an airplane in the process.\\"  The actual theory boils down to this: reproduction with heritable differences and competition will, over time, lead to new features and species.  Ray's analogy covers none of this--the car, at the end of 60 seconds, is unchanged, is still the same car, and is only going faster.  What scientists are looking at is small but regular changes in populations over the span of many generations (so not a single organism) and inferring that these changes keep building up over time (even if the rate of evolution stays the same).  And they test that using fossils and genetics and comparitive anatomy.    Scientists can predict the age of the rock we should find particular trasitional fossils in, what features the fossil will have, and then go out and find such fossils (Tiktaalik, for example).  If evolution weren't true, this should be impossible.  They can also measure how much genetic change takes place over time and compare the level of change in genes of modern creatures.  The earlier two critters were supposed to have diverged, the more change they find.  Yet they also find that related features are built out of modified versions of the same genes.  And they can check the genetic timeline with the fossil record and vice versa.  \\"Macroevolution\\" is accepted on far, far more than guesswork, so Ray lies about and denies the evidence.    Ray would also make you think that esteemed scientists are in doubt of the theory of evolution.  In one particularly egregious instance, he quotes the late Stephen Jay Gould: \\"But how do you get from nothing to such an elaborate something if evolution must proceed through a long sequence of intermediate stages, each favored by natural selection? You can't fly with 2% of a wing...\\"  Gould was merely summing up a particular argument of the time against natural selection and goes on in the essay Ray pillaged to explain that the benefit of 2% of a wing wouldn't be for flying, but something else (such as thermoregulation) and wings used for flight evolved later as the proto-wings grew larger under selection for the other benefit (from \\"Not Necessarily a Wing\\" by Stephen Jay Gould).    Essentially, Ray is forever out of his depth and so he resorts to lies, strawmen, quotemines and attacks on Darwin's character (as though Darwin being a bad person would make evolution untrue).  He simply does not know what he's talking about, though people have tried to educate him hundreds of times.  If you want to read Origin, buy an unabridged edition--Amazon has several.  Ray's intro is avaliable for free online if you really want to have a laugh at his expense, but don't pay for it; let Ray and his minions eat the cost of printing out this pathetic would-be tract.
B0029O08WA|3.0|I think the soundtrack is OK, though it isn't like the Twilight Soundtrack at all.  And I must mention, I absolutely loved the Twilight Soundtrack.  A person would really have to like Indie Music to appreciate the songs on this album.
B002P7UCMC|2.0|I'm guessing this album might split some Rammstein fans.  I'm really not feeling it so far, but hopefully it will grow on me.  That said, fans of older Rammstein will probably love this.  Most songs are reminiscent of the faster more classically industrial sounding stuff from their earlier albums.  If you liked that, by all means buy this.  For people like me who are geared to the more straight-forward rock anthems on Reise Reise and Rosenrot, there's a lot less to enjoy.  I'm probably only adding 4 of these songs to my playlist:  Ich Tu Dir Wen, B********, Fuhre Mich, and Donaukinder.  Even these are getting a little boring already.  (And Fuhre Mich sounds almost exactly like Spil Mit Mir)  Still, my 2 stars might mean 5 for you.  Go nuts.
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|It just went strait into my DVD player the moment it arrived, I just love this so did my son, he just fell in love, which I expected, its my all time favorite too. Thanks Amazon for getting this beauty for so low price and on time.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|The first time my daughter saw snippets from this movie was at my cousin's wedding - at 1 year old, she was captured and mesmerized by the music and film snippets. My own little Beauty deserves nothing but the best - and a Platinum Edition is a timeless classic ... just like that magical moment of her watching those snippets that night.
B001KVZ6F2|4.0|1.  I'm more a fan of the earlier Clint Eastwood movies.<br /><br />2.  With that being said, I was very pleasantly surprised with the overall excellence of this movie.  It's pretty much top notch from all points of view.<br /><br />3.  Highly recommended.
0440237688|4.0|I first read this book five years ago, and just re-read it.  It has a profound and emotional quality---and in parts is a great metaphor for the terrible psychological conformity of our society and world, and for the power and intensity and specialness of one who challenges that conformity by thinking outside the box.  That is the strength of the book, and here Lois Lowry shows her creative genius as a writer.  So many times she subtly and deftly spun a sentence or two that brought the community she portrayed into the most vivid, realistic life.<br /><br />But some parts of the book left me questioning---and wanting more.  Allow me to list two:<br /><br />1) Weak ending.  Without giving away too much information, I felt it lacked the power and immediacy of the first half of the book.  I felt the same way when I read the book five years ago--and part of how I remember the weakness of the ending is that I couldn't remember it at all!  I remembered the beginning---plot and themes---so well.  The end just gets murky and semi-irrelevant, like she lost her focus.<br /><br />2) Too much reliance on magic.  When the Giver starts transmitting memories to Jonas in magical fashion, the book loses its strength of reality.  Lowry did not need to jump into magic to make her point, and I felt this weakened her point---and the potential strength she could have accomplished.<br /><br />So overall I felt the first half or so of the book was utter genius, and I think little could be added to improve it.  Not so with the second half, and especially the last third...
B001QB9H10|3.0|1.  I liked Jason Statham from the Italian Job.  However, I've realized that just because one is in a good movie, that doesn't mean that all of their other movies are good.<br /><br />2.  Thus, I was somewhat dubious as to whether or not it would be a waste of time to check out this DVD, but in the end, it was a worthwhile film.  The acting was relatively non-annoying (exception:  the  female actress was... really really bad), the plot line was understandable and the overall film was entertaining.<br /><br />3.  Hey, it's not rocket science, but that's ok--> it's just pure decent entertainment, that's not as juvenile as something like... the fast and furious type of films.
B000I2J2W2|5.0|I've been a fan of Forbidden Planet since I was a kid in the 60s.  But while I've seen it hundreds of times, I've NEVER seen it as crisp, clean and beautifully displayed as in this HD-DVD version.  That includes the special edition anniversary version on DVD, which was remastered from original material just for that edition.  High definition really lends itself to this sort of visually oriented film, and it's just wonderfully done on this disc.  Bravo!
B0029O08WA|1.0|I am very disapointed in this soundtrack. I understand that this part of the saga is sad and depressing, but the sountrack sounds like music from the 70s, not today. There are a couple of ok songs. I like three songs out of the whole album. \\"Meet me on the equinox\\" by Death Cab for Cutie, \\"A white demon love song\\" by The Killers and \\"I belong to you\\" by Muse. I really hope the movie isn't as bad as the sountrack. :(:(:(
B000R5N1MC|5.0|I think the only thing I could ask for beyond what's on the five discs in this set is to have been on the set and actually THERE while they made the film.  It's not just comprehensive, it's exhaustive, containing EVERYTHING about the film, from the first rough cut to the various theatrical releases to the final, definitive director's cut.  And in HD-DVD it's exquisite!  Clear and sharp, it looks better than it did on the big screen when I first saw it.  It's a great package for a really great film.
B0029O08WA|5.0|This soundtrack is brilliant in my opinion.  Every song perfectly fits the story of New Moon!  Each song, I can visualize the scenes that they should be in.  A lot of people who have reviewed this CD don't care for the music, but I think it's fantastic that little-known artists were chosen instead of the typical mainstream.  Twilight soundtrack fit that movie, but this one fits New Moon!  Possibility by Lykke Li is a beautiful song.  Band of Skulls is one of my favorite new bands and I'm so happy that they got to be on this!  Friends is a great song!  Of course, my musical heart belongs to Muse and am thrilled with anything they do!  But I think mostly, these songs sing the story of New Moon.  And for that, I think all of the songs are perfect!
B001EAWMGA|4.0|Ah yes, I remember. The name of the king is Rothgar and his kingdom (a small walled village really) is Heorot. Why this is a Science Fiction origin story for the Beowulf legend and none the worse for it.    This is the sort of film that gives Science Fiction Action movies a good name. Why do I like it so much? Let me count the ways.    The Viking society of the period looks authentic. I'm not saying that it is authentic, but it certainly looks it.    There's a good rationale for the alien looking like a human being. That's because he is human. There's a good reason why he's crash-landed on Earth and why he's hunting the monster. Also why he's quite morose for much of the film. But tough, this is an action movie and our hero can kick bottom with the best of them. The monster is a terrific creation slightly resembling Marveldog the man-eating monster from Alan Moore's Miracleman series. If you've seen the trailers you might think it's a dragon breathing fire but it isn't. It uses an intense bio-luminescence which looks great and is a good idea to boot.    Great cast. Jim Caviezel makes a good hero and is well-supported by British actress Sophia Myles as King John Hurt's sassy daughter, Jack Houston as the man who would be the next king and marry the ex-king's daughter -you can see the tension already- Ron Pearlman doing gruff, tough and aggressive, and a plethora of character actors with a variety of accents, most of whom get eaten, minced, maimed, and deaded in a variety of ways.    The monster is used sparingly and some time is spent with Viking/hero interactions which some people see as a flaw but I enjoyed. The action sequences are convincing as are the excellent special effects. I've a teensy problem with the satisfying but predictable end but that's really the worst I can say.    So, not the greatest movie ever made, hence the 4 star rating, but one hell of a good time. Loved it. Going to watch it again soon. Buy it. Now. Stop reading, go and buy it. Okay, I'm finished.
B000005RFQ|5.0|In spite of all the problems with the original recording of this album and internal strife within Black Sabbath at the time, this happens to be my favorite album from this band, in close competition with the Dio-Sabbath albums.  I read somewhere that the band wanted to make the musical equivalent of horror movies, and this best achieves their goal.    If you get \\"Born Again\\", look for the remastered version.  I bought the cassette when it first came out and it sounded like a cheap, inferior, bootleg version; very poor sound quality.
0882709194|1.0|This is not the original book introduction. Ray Comfort does not know science and probably did not even read the original book. He does not understand evolution and the science behind it. Wake up people and realize that Ray need an education in Science.
B0006M4SO6|4.0|This disc is pretty straight forward. If you're a fan of what Metheny, Mays and company have done in the past then you'll enjoy it. If not, then you won't. The compositions and musicianship are excellent and there are plenty of guitar and piano solos to keep you happy. (Lyle Mays still amazes me. He is to Jazz piano what Rick Wakeman and Keith Emerson are to Progressive Rock keyboards.) Of course, as with any work of this length (1 composition - 68:10 - 4 songs) there is a tendency to stretch and get a little spacey at times. It's usually brought back into the fold quite nicely. This is the same band he's had for a while and it shows. They play together easily and get the job done. Being a fan of both Metheny and longer pieces, I personally like it but can see how those expecting something more or different could be a little disappointed.
B0013FDM7E|3.0|In many respects this is little more than a star vehicle and although Smith gives a strong enough performance as the gun-toting, iron-pumping hero he is never convincing as the desperate scientist trying to save the human race. As the third film version of Richard Matheson's novel this movie strays pretty far from the original material, but that's par for the course with Hollywood adaptations. Some of Neville's personal torment is retained and Smith portrays this well, but apart from this and the basic premise there is little from the book that remains. On the other hand they've shoehorned in a bunch of flashbacks that are clunky and largely superfluous. That said this is entertaining when considered simply as a thrill ride, and the depiction of New York city as an overgrown, derelict ghost town is particularly well realised.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|Let me say that on one hand this is just good old Radiohead, and on the other it's just good old Radiohead. Nothing particularly groundbreaking or overly new for the band but it's presented in an epic manner. This sounds like a very careful album. Something they planned and laid out well in advanced. The clean production allows you to hear every instrument and track independently. Definitive digital without any lose of spaceyness or art.    \\"15 Step\\" is a good opener that gets your groove on and includes a nominal nod towards Floyd circa Ummagumma.     \\"Bodysnatchers\\" is as close as the band has come to sounding U2ish through the vocals and Jonny's echoing/fuzz guitar work.    \\"Nude\\" gives Thom a chance to display some emotionally driven vocals. BTW, I can't remember the last time I heard him, or anyone else, so clear sounding. Excellent, excellent recording.    These songs lead into a series of beautifully crafted pieces. \\"Weird Fishes/Arpeggi\\" is one of the albums highlights as is \\"Reckoner\\".     Love the piano on \\"All I Need\\" and \\"Faust Arp\\" could easily be on The Beatles White Album. \\"House Of cards\\" epitomizes the Southern California/ Grateful Dead sounds that are spread over the album and mixes it with some Floydish keys and guitar work, trippy hippy things are happening here.    \\"Jigsaw Falling Into Place\\" is probably the most upbeat piece where they closest to rockin'. Nice acoustic guitars that slide into a boppin' tune.    The only disappointment is the last song, \\"Videotape\\". Kinda sounds like filler guys.     Don't take it wrong that all these influences and borrowed sounds detract anything from the originality of the band. They definitely make every song their own and if anyone can pull it off it's these guys, they've been doing this for years.    The disc plays quickly and easily but makes you want to hit repeat when it's over. Anyway, go to the website and download it. Good, good stuff here.     \\"Everybody leaves  If they get the chance  And this is my chance\\" - Yeah, they do, it is.
0545157617|5.0|I bought this book for my 3 y/o daughter and as with other books by Julia Donaldson, she loves it. The story is  original, smart and well written in the form of rhyme, but is also simple enough so a small child can follow it without getting bored. The illustrations are colorful and fun and my dd likes to follow them and tell the story herself.    Overall a great book that will be read over and over again.
0307454541|5.0|I was totally consumed by the plot of this book.  The action was never predictable right to the last sentence.  Captivating, intriguing and well written, this book never drags.  Can't wait to read the next one....Girl Who Played With Fire.
B002OOG6RQ|4.0|I've been waiting for this ever since Rosenrot came out, which seems like a century ago. Though mislead with the single P****, the downright worst song on the album, I was a bit weary of buying a full length album because of the single. P**** didn't seem like something they'd do, but I must say that the 11 song album is redeeming.<br /><br />1. Rammlied has a likeness to it from their earlier song 'Hallelujia' (not sure how it's spelled). This has a lot of synthesizer sound to it, choir, organs, classic of the band. I'd probably rate this song as average/ possibly above. Good, fast beat.<br /><br />2. Ich Tu Dir Wen. This song starts a little slow, then builds well. Chorus sounds great (even though I don't know German lol). I really like the singer's voice in this one, pitch changes, etc. Steady, drumy beat. I'd have to rate this song above average. One of the best on the album.<br /><br />3 Waidmanns Heil. Starts out at a banging, sprinting pace and has that electronic drum beat to it that's used well for this song. Till (the singer) sounds pretty evil here, especially at the chorus, where he shouts the lyrics (without overdoing it, of course). I'd rate this song same as number 2<br /><br />4.Haifisch: Starts off with a weird synthesiser sound, then singing. Not fast, not real slow. Bassy drums. Chorus then explodes! Then goes back to  the same medium beat, slows, and explodes again. Love that choir in the background, which makes it sound like spiritual music ... a long drum chorus with slight guitar, slows, then explodes! I gave this song above average. 4 of 5 stars.<br /><br />5. B******** : Begins with a wicked guitar riff, drums, and roaring guitar. Till's voice is soft and meek at first, but you can tell he's serious. Then chorus, which is loud and kinda annoying. I don't like this song. I rate it 2 of five stars, five being best.<br /><br />6. Fruhling in Paris: Starts out with a peacful guitar strumming. Soft, pretty voice of Till's. Sounds like a melody, reminecent of Seemann. Builds a little, but is never heavy. I'd classify it more as a ballad. One of my favs of the album. If you like Seeman, Sonne, Ohne Dich, Stirb Nicht Von Mir, you will probably like this. I'd rate this 5 of five. At least worth one listen, anyway.<br /><br />7. Wiener Blut: Starts a little like Mein Herz Brennt/Speeluhr, then blows up with fast music, stops, explodes, stops, then goes all wild. Lyrics are loud and unable to make anything out of them. Just yelling. I dislike this tune. 1 and half of five stars<br /><br />8. P*****. I'm sure you've heard this one; if not, you didn't miss anything. Lyrics are childish and corny. I'd rate one of five stars. My LEAST fav song on album.<br /><br />9. Liebe Ist Fur Alle Da: Cool drumming, fast, then the wail of guitars. Very heavy.<br />Chorus is serious-sounding with a wicked tone. Builds, builds, and finally climaxes. I'd rate a 3 out of five. Maybe higher Pretty good song.<br /><br />10. Mehr: Starts with electronic guitars. Slow, but cool. Not slow like the Paris song. Especially not till the chorus comes. When it does, it becomes a good, bang-your-head song. Remindes me of something off Sechensuch (I know, my German spelling is bad). I'd give this song 3 and a half stars<br /><br />11. Roter Sand: Stars with whistling, like Engel. Another ballad. Soft guitars, sweet lyrics. Most mellow song on here, probably  moreso than the Paris song. Also reminds me of Seemann. I'd rate this four or five stars. I'm a sucker for the softer Rammstein's songs.<br /><br />All in all, I thought this was a pretty good CD. I think the single P**** ruined it for some people, but I don't think any Rammstein fan would be dissapointed with any of the songs on this album, save the single. It's not their best album, and definitely not their worst. I wouldn't know what to say their best album is if I had to. The weakest ones for me was their very first and probably Reise Reise. Their best is either Sechensuch or Mutter. A lot of people didn't like Rosenrot, but I found quite a few songs on there I liked. Anyway, I'd recommend this. I just wish I would have gotten the extended album instead. Oh well.mmend this. I just wish I would have gotten the extended album instead. Oh well.
B002LVVCQM|5.0|If you find yourself in the position of having to confront people who simply refuse to \\"believe\\" in evolution, Richard Dawkins' latest book is a must-read.  It is a remarkable recital of the evidence supporting the theory of evolution by natural selection.  After you read the book, you will have mountains of evidence to use in your next discussion of the subject.    Now, chances are good that your evolution-denier is also deeply religious. And Dawkins' science writing was clearly eclipsed by the fame resulting from \\"The God Delusion,\\" which makes his name lightning to invoke in a discussion with a religious person. But be aware that this book covers entirely different ground than \\"God Delusion.\\"  While Dawkins does not back off or deny his anti-theistic stance, it is very much a side note here.  \\"A different T-shirt,\\" as he describes it.    He makes the audacious claim that if there had never been a single fossil ever discovered anywhere, we would still be overwhelmed by the evidence of evolution surrounding us.  Which is not to say he does not address fossils.  He also addresses molecular and radioactive dating, geological strata and plate tectonics, DNA sequencing, Darwin's voyages and observations, geographic isolation of animals and plants, and the remarkable Lenski experiments with bacterial evolution demonstrating evolution taking place literally before our very eyes.  He also prepares you for responses to common canards about evolution like the idea that Darwinism leads to Nazism, which is of course nonsense on stilts -- but if you've never heard the argument before, it can be useful to have a critical response back to it.    Dawkins is a clear, persuasive, and readily-understood author.  If you have average intelligence, you should have no trouble understanding every concept of the book, including daunting subjects like genetic science.  At the same time, he doesn't \\"dumb down\\" his material -- he trusts that you will be able to understand him and if not, that you can take the time to read over a passage more than once.  He is also quite funny at times.  If I have any complaint about the book at all, it is that Dawkins uses a lot of footnotes, which while typically very charming, can tend to make one lose the thread of his lucid prose.  I have the Kindle version of the book, which is good for working through the text and skipping the footnotes.  But I've also seen my friend's hard copy of the book, and it contains plentiful color plates which obviously will enrich the reading experience.    What are you waiting for.  Get what is surely destined to become the definitive book on evolution.
0312360266|4.0|This book started out slow, but worked its way up. The authors try too hard at making the people sound younger. I really enjoyed this book and the series is great!
0385504225|3.0|I was disappointed with Dan Brown this time. The Lost Symbol is so much like his previous books....the really strange villain, some unbelieveable situations, etc. It's more of a Masonic tell-all, and if that's what you want, it will be an interesting read. I just think he could do much better. I almost didn't finish it as I found it boring.
B00127RAJY|5.0|You will wake-up sore and happy tomorrow if you do this DVD today.  It is the best 20 minutes you can spend burning calories and \\"shredding\\" your body into something awesome.  It's for any level of fitness.  I started this when I was 200 lbs (5'2\\") and I thought I might die by the end of level one.  But I stuck with it and now can make it through level three with only a moderate amount of suffering.  The awesome thing is that at every level you can continue to push yourself harder and harder as you get more used to the exercises.  Between Jillian and a very deep understanding and respect for calories I'm now 135 (thank you very much).  So go on and push yourself, sweat it out and be that person you know you can be.
B000R8YC18|4.0|This film is incredible. DeNiro gives an outstanding performance and the supporting actors do very well. The cinematography is great, and it really enhances the feel of the movie. Worth watching by anyone who wants to see a well-thought, well-planned, phenomenal movie.
B0002KQNJU|5.0|I absolutely love Roman Polanski's movies, but this has to be one of the best. I think the reason is that Polanski also stars, and his turn as the naive, soft-spoken, innocent Alfred is what makes this film a true classic. Almost all of the funny moments happen as a result of something he does or says or something that is done to him, and if nothing else, his expressions are adorably fun to watch.<br /><br />Aside from Polanski, this is one of the few accounts of his future-wife Sharon Tate's beauty & skill. The chemistry between the two is intoxicating, especially when you see how confident Tate is around Polanski and how shy and introverted Polanski seems around here. The end scene where the two are riding in the carriage (before she...well, you know) is so bittersweet and touching.<br /><br />Okay, aside from Polanski & Tate, there are other wonderful aspects of this film. The score is eerie and perfectly suited to this masterpiece, and the scenery is intoxicating (just take a look at the snow, not to mention the adorable snowman that Alfred builds for Sarah).<br /><br />The funniest scenes definitely take place once the Professor & Alfred get to the castle. I love when Alfred is to scared to sleep in his own room, and he tries to get in bed with the professor.<br /><br />The ball was a perfect climax to the film, especially when the vampires realize that the only relection in the mirrors is of Alfred & the Professor. The last scenes are horribly nerve-wracking and tense, with a perfect finish. Leave it to Polanski to end this film the exact opposite of what you'd expect. A happy ending? Not in a Polanski movie.<br /><br />That's why we love him!
B00000ING2|1.0|Badly written -- the screenwriter evidently considers loud, inane wisecracking to be biting satire (it's not).    Badly directed -- the director seems to have thought large, empty sets would nicely set off against the long, empty script (it doesn't) and to have persuaded every single actor that loud and over-broad, with lots of distracting physical schtick thrown in for good measure, was just what his/her role required (it wasn't).    Badly acted -- the actors without exception seem to have had the mistaken impression that they were in a Broadway theater with the whole audience packed into the last rows and their \\"craft\\" required shouting every line and over emphasizing every movement and posture (they weren't and it didn't).    But, except for the inane screenwriting, inept direction, and inapt acting,...
0385504225|5.0|Summary: This book is great, fastpaced entertainment with shocking moments and with a storyline which also encourages to think. The combination of interesting characters, great story line, science, mystic, religion, action, symbolism, riddle solving, history and a great ending generates another great ride, that nobody should miss.    Here now some details:    Contains NO spoilers!!! The fun about reading the book is not knowing what the book is about. Therefore this review does not contain any spoilers, but instead gives some general impressions.    After the huge success of \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" I doubted that Dan Brown could repeat that success and could come up with another great story of such magnitude. After such a great success, authors often come up quickly with their next story. Not Dan Brown. He took several years to research and fine tune a story which turned out (again) to be a thrilling ride with fascinating characters, strong story line and shocking revelations and which stands worthy next to his other two stories featuring Robert Langdon.    Some key aspects, that I loved:    (1) The character of Mal'akh was very well done. Excellent character with great background. Shocking!    (2) The writing style is similar to James Patterson. Very short chapters of normally 2-4 pages. That makes it almost impossible to lay the book down .... one more chapter .... one more chapter ... and another 3 hours are gone. Great entertainment and great style. That also helps the author to switch easily between up to three parallel storylines which are important for the story.    (3) The whole story plays again (like in Angels and Daemons) in a short time frame (this time around 12 hours) which generates a high pace feeling like in the TV show 24.     (4) The book has some shocking moments which are unforgettable and I did not know how Dan Brown could solve it, but he did it in a form which was believable. One moment almost at the end was so shocking and surprising that the book almost fell out of my hands. Not many authors have done that to me.    (5) A great tourist guide. While reading the book, I wished I would be on site and could read the book at the actual locations where it takes place. The Lost Symbol is for Washington, what Angels and Daemons was for Rome and what the The Da Vince Code was for Paris. I can already envision Lost Symbol Tours.     (6) Believable and fulfilling ending. Quite some often, authors raise a lot of expectations in the first few hundred pages of their books, but then do not find a way how to get the story to a fulfilling ending. Not here. I loved the ending. It makes sense and all storylines closed to my full satisfaction, some with big surprises.    Summary: This book is great entertaining with shocking moments and which also encourages to think. The combination of interesting characters, science, mystic, religion, action, symbolism, history and a great ending generates another great ride, that nobody should miss.
B000HT386M|5.0|Ok, there are enough reviews here so I'm going to keep it short and simple.<br /><br />I never thought I'd say this about an Adam Sandler movie... this movie makes you think and reevaluate your life.
0307473708|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the series so I was wary to read the book.  I was thrilled when I read it and found the intensity, gore, and Dexter to be better than ever.  Highly recommended!!!
B000N6U0E2|5.0|This is truly a beautiful movie.<br /><br />In this movie, Will Smith acts a father who put all of his energy toward his goals. He was a happy middle-class family man who invested all of his savings on a promising small business which later failed. He lost everything. His wife, however, only added to the problem. She was shallow and unsupportive. Their situation was difficult because he was a brilliant man who had a real shot at making it if only he could finish an unpaid internship at a stock firm, but in the meantime, he wouldn't be able to make a dime. His wife was a hard worker, but she didn't have much ambition. All she wanted was for him to get a weak job and keep it for the rest of his life. He wanted more though. And he took the internship.<br /><br />His wife eventually left him and he kept their kid. She wanted no responsibilities.<br /><br />It's truly heartbreaking how he plays with his kid and makes him believe that they are \\"camping\\" when they have to sleep in the streets. He is really a great father and his pain is transferred from the screen to your heart. This movie made me cry of sadness and joy after he finally made it.<br /><br />He ended up founding his own stock firm.<br /><br />Amazing that this is based on the life of someone who actually exists. I just love this type of stories.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|This concert made me feel as if I was right there with the audience.  The performances were flawless.  I would reccomend it to any michael jackson fan.
B0000AC8LL|5.0|Considering this movie was made in 1970, it's impressive how they managed to do it without using modern computer software. The unbiased narrative and historical value is good enough and we finally get to see a why Japan had a logical reason to attack and to do it when they did.<br /><br />If you're looking for insane action, ultra cool effects, and hollywood flare, then watch the newer Pearl Harbor with Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnet. That movie rocked as an entertainment piece, but if you're looking for a less biased view of the events that enfolded in on Pearl Harbor, Tora Tora Tora is the movie to watch.<br /><br />For making and releasing this movie without the help of modern technology, and specially during the vietnam war when such a movie would be considered highly unpatriotic, I give this movie 5*
B0000025KI|5.0|I'm gonna get hung upside down for this, I know, but, for me personally, this was and remains Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band's finest hour.<br /><br />One of the reasons is that the songs just seem to flow out of the Boss here; he's dealing with people and subjects with which he SOUNDS at ease, and on both the exhuberant songs (\\"Out In The Street,\\" \\"Crush On You,\\" \\"Hungry Heart\\") and the ballads/sad ones (\\"Point Blank,\\" \\"Independence Day,\\" the title track), Springsteen connects with the heart and the head of the listener all at once.  Another reason is that the production, the track order and the ace musical muscle of the E Street Band combine here to make this one of the few double-albums that really works as a whole. Even with a few songs that are perhaps lesser in quality than others here, nothing feels like a mistake or an overreach. THE RIVER works both as a whole and with the individual components.<br /><br />Bruce Springsteen has seldom made as completely satisfying an album as THE RIVER, though the sheer high quality of most of his output is indisputable. Agree or disgaree with me all you want---when I hear this sublime album, that's all that matters.
B0029O08WA|5.0|This is not commercial music with the same beat over and over again.  The music is unique, complex and really original.  Kudos to the producers of this album for some real soul searching music.  Highly recommend.
0385504225|3.0|I like Dan Brown's stuff, but it seems to me that \\"...Symbol\\" is just more of Robert Langdon scurrying around breaking codes and saving the world (maybe not that) with a woman who's not his love interest.  Whatever happened to Vittoria Vetra from \\"A & D\\"?  Anyway, we've seen all this before in \\"Da Vinci Code\\" and \\"A & D\\".  I liked this one well enough though, despite the recurring visions I had of Tom Hanks (a fine actor, by the way).  I would like something new from Brown.
B002LLDTA4|5.0|Academy Award-winning documentary filmmaker Murray Lerner has unearthed quite a gem in making this film featuring Leonard Cohen's mesmerizing Isle of Wight performance from 1970. The 64-minute film deftly weaves modern interviews from relevant performers and associates of Leonard Cohen with the vintage musical performance by Cohen and his band, the affectionately named \\"Army\\" comprised of such stalwarts as legendary music producer Bob Johnston.<br /><br />The audio quality is a sonic revelation, obliterating my expectations for a live multi-track recording from 1970 staged in front of 600,000 fans that had gotten rowdier as the festival progressed. Jimi Hendrix had performed his set before Cohen, with the crowd setting various things on fire like a piano and the scaffolding surrounding the stage. But the music was not to be denied, as Leonard Cohen slowly took the stage after they found a replacement piano and organ.<br /><br />At 4 a.m. on August 31, 1970, the man introduced to the crowd as \\"a novelist, a poet, an author, a singer\\", began his intimate performance that encompassed most of the hits that had earned him acclaim, from \\"Bird On the Wire\\" to \\"Suzanne\\" and other well-known songs mainly from his first two albums. A nice surprise are the short stories Cohen shares and poem fragments he uses to introduce many of the songs. The crowd, who had booed previous performers like Kris Kristofferson, sat in rapt attention to the mostly acoustic set. My only quibble is that the complete audio performance by Leonard Cohen is not included on the Blu-ray. The CD version includes a couple of songs not shown in the documentary. I have no idea if the footage simply did not exist or was simply left out at the director's discretion.<br /><br />The Blu-ray, on a single BD-25, is transferred from the original 16mm camera negative to 1080i. This is not footage that is going to blow viewers away by its visual quality. In fact on an absolute basis, the BD is well below the norm expected for high-definition titles. Prepare for an experience of limited visual quality. It is true that this Blu-ray replicates as closely as possible the 16mm film source the concert was shot in. The modern interviews, with such luminaries as Judy Collins and Joan Baez, are all in excellent picture quality, but do remind the viewer of the inherent limitations in the concert footage. Still, it looks like much of the other concert footage I have seen from the era on the Blu-ray format. The only notable defect is the continual appearance of an ultra-thin vertical black line that runs down the middle of the camera image on tight close-ups of Leonard Cohen. It looks to be the result of a continuous gate scratch on the original 16mm film. A small emulsion error in the original master also appears in the corner of the frame, later in the concert.<br /><br />On a technical basis the transfer looks perfect without a hint of artifacting, revealing every limitation and nuance of the source material. The AVC encode consistently runs at very high bitrates, most of the time in the thirties. I would estimate an average video bitrate of 31 Mbps, which allows the fuzzy film shot in questionable lighting conditions to reveal its full resolution on Blu-ray. The image has a low-contrast appearance that is soft and has moments of poor focus. The black levels have some minor exposure problems, revealing a bit of noise. This is not a transfer with remarkable shadow detail, or even average detail, but looks on par with other concert footage I have viewed from the period. The Woodstock documentary on Blu-ray has similar picture quality. Tiny white specks that look like flash bulbs do pepper the image from time to time. It rarely becomes a distraction though.<br /><br />The picture quality is tolerable enough to enjoy the real benefit of this BD release, the uncompressed high-resolution stereo PCM track at 24-bit/96 kHz and the lossless 5.1 Dolby TrueHD soundtrack. Both are simply spellbinding and really the only way one should listen to this material. Mastering engineer Mark Wilder has done an outstanding job. The music shows absolutely no signs of limiting or compression, and reproduces without fault this live audio document. I wish most music releases were mastered this carefully. There is not a hint of thinness to the sound, and the fidelity is surprisingly great for a project of this nature. At times the songs approach the quality of the studio versions in dynamics and clarity. The producer did not attempt to cover up any deficits in the original recording though. A few microphone pops occur and occasionally instruments bleed into other channels. The audience is barely audible most of the time except during the musical interludes. With both SACD and DVD-Audio being commercially irrelevant for the major music labels, this disc is the best fidelity we will ever see this music presented in a commercial medium.<br /><br />A lot of care and thought has gone into the packaging and presentation of this release. Included is a 16-page booklet that has wonderful photographs and top-notch liner notes by Sylvie Simmons. The booklet reproduces the same content of the booklet included in the CD/DVD release, but in a much larger format that is easier to read and enjoy. It really makes the numerous archival photographs easier to appreciate. It is rare to see such entertaining and insightful liner notes that significantly add to the product, but that is plainly the case here. Aside from a menu, there are no extras on the disc itself.<br /><br />Currently this BD is an exclusive title at the Internet retailer Amazon. Fans of Leonard Cohen need to go out and pick this item up immediately. The concert is a window to a much younger looking-and-sounding Leonard Cohen. The sound quality alone is enough reason to buy it, for Cohen truly invests emotion and vigor into the performance that puts a new spin on songs for fans only familiar with the album versions. His vocal inflection adds a bit of emotional weariness to \\"The Partisan\\" for example that is simply not there on the album version. The only lackluster performance is \\"Famous Blue Raincoat\\", where it sounds as if Cohen's voice grows fatigued. The backing musicians all give splendid accompaniment to the music, though the camera rarely shows them aside from the two comely female singers at Cohen's side.<br /><br />Subtitles available:<br />Spanish<br />English<br />French<br />Dutch<br />Italian<br />German
B00006I53S|5.0|I am really enjoying this lenses since I have received it about a month ago. Before this I was just using the standard kit lens that comes with a Rebel Xti (18-55). The glass in this lens seems to be superior to my prior lens and my images seems to have a crispness to them that they didn't have before. The only thing that I do not like about the lens is its ability to go out of focus. If you are on an upward or downward angle over 45 degree's the lens shifts out of focus. So I simply just hold it down manually, and that is a simple fix.     Once again I am super happy with my purchase and I would suggest this lens to anyone else because of its quality to price ratio.
B002K0WBXW|2.0|Who is too timid to enter a room naked when they are the only person in the room? Who aims a boat at a buoy in the middle of a bay, and then lets go of the steering wheel 5 seconds before hitting it? Who goes to Sitka from New York for the weekend, and believes they will be back for a morning appointment on Monday? These are examples of the leaps of logic expected from viewers of this rubbish.    Weak writing, poor character development, and a useless Bonus feature of a self serving narrative by the writers of The Proposal, left me bewildered and  disappointed.    There are huge holes in the script, making the characters seem quite clueless. I get the feeling that all the nice things that are being said about this version of the movie and the 2 disc deluxe version are being left by members of Disney's PR department, because The Proposal is a stinker. Skip it. If you are a die hard fan of the stars, rent it somewhere cheap. Don't spend more than a buck, or you will feel cheated.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have been a huge Tae-Bo fan for about 7 years now and got great results with it in the past doing the advanced workouts.  After I had my baby, I didn't work out regularly for over a year and was looking for something to get back into exercising with.  This one is SO perfect!  I asked for the 30-Day Shred for Christmas last year and did it as many days of the week as I could.  On days I had more time, I would still throw in a Tae-Bo or do 2 of Jillian's Shred workouts in a row.  I did each level 10 times until I was done (took me about 2 months).  During that time I lost my baby weight and was back in to my pre-baby jeans!  Then I went back to work full time.  It has been 6 months now and I finally am starting to work out REGULARLY (again).  I went back to the 30-Day Shred series because for 20 minutes a day, it DOES NOT waste my time!  As a busy full-time working mom, I don't want to waste my time I could be spending with my daughter on something that is not going to be worth it and, frankly, not kick my butt!  This one does every time :)  Afterwards, my body feels almost as \\"worked\\" as when I used to do my 1-hour Tae-Bo workouts (which I will still throw in every once in awhile when I have more time because they are fun).  This workout makes every spare minute you have count!
0061914177|5.0|I love Gary, I love his passion and I think had I read this book prior to knowing Gary virally as many of us have over the past few years I would of loved this book much more but it was missing, it was missing the CRUSH in CRUSH IT. This book I think is great as a lender, buy one buy a few and get them to the people who are not Internet crazy like The Vayner Chuckers are. I have busted Gary a few times about the Audio version of his book and that's what I will wait for because that is how I know Gary. The wacko cursing dirty jersey boy and it doesnt transcend into his book, at least not this first attempt. I think the next book should come with an audio version. Look if someone buys his book and doesnt know him via video etc then the book as wonderful as it can be can never reach the POW Gary gives plus I know Gary thinks Newspapers are on the out, he curses it up a ton at the videos Ive seen so lets follow up with that thought....Audio Book should be a huge push on his part...after all 90% of his followers are more into the Podcasts and Videos over text on a paper...Audio is the way to go and I cant wait for it to come out on Crush It. In the meantime, I bought 3 and will give them to 3 Freelancers who like this kinda stuff but are not much into Social Media so would never hear of Gary under their current Internet ways. All in all, Gary knows what to do and even on his worst day of marketing and passion its better than 90% of most people's best day. Big Blue Forever (suck it GV, lol).    PS I gave this book 5 stars because the content is still great but when you get spoiled by all the GV videos and ustreams, etc the book can never equal the author.
1572814349|3.0|This is a beautiful deck of cards, no question about it.  However, it really deviates from the Rider/Waite deck which is what most books are written on.  So, if you want to learn the tarot, this is not the deck for you.  If you already know the tarot, then this deck will surely impress those who come to you for a reading, especially if they know nothing about the subject.    So, as soon as I received this deck along with the book 78 degrees of wisdom by Rachel Pollack, I knew I made a mistake in the selection of my first deck.  My only regret in buying this deck was the timing. I am happy to own it, but not learn from it.
B00000269G|5.0|I had been a fan of such jazz greats as Erroll Gardner, Dave Brubeck, George Shearing and Ahmad Jamal as a teenager growing up in St. Louis. My jazz collection evaporated over the years as my life circumstances  and family obligations changed and I moved from place to place in my profession. Other things took precedence over music. I am now retired and living in Florida.      When I recently went to Amazon's listings for jazz I saw many old artists as well as new ones. I was delighted to see the selection available. I thought I recognized the album that I once owned (now CD) by Erroll Gardner entitled \\"Concert By The Sea\\" as one that I enjoyed many years ago. I took a chance and ordered it from Amazon at a very reasonable price and have been just delighted with it. It is in fact the one that I remembered and hoped it would be. I forgot just how talented Erroll was, which is especially intriguing since he could not read music. Instead, he thought music and it came out through his fingers. Now I am rebuilding my old jazz collection via Amazon as well as adding new artist, all at a reasonable price. And Florida is always sunny and warm! Is this a great country or what.    Always love America and guard against  the socialistic tendencies of our president and other government officials, including Congress !!  Read about and study the political philosophy of our founding fathers Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Madison and Franklin. There are many good books on them available through Amazon.
B0029O08WA|1.0|THIS CD IS A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT FOR ME.  EVERYONE I KNOW THAT IS A TWILIGHT FAN IS DISAPPOINTED.  IT JUST DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME VIBE AS TWILIGHT.  MY 13 YR OLD DAUGHTER DOESN'T EVEN LIKE IT.
B0001ZX0OW|1.0|**Warning** Spoilers ahead.    How this pile of rubbish won so many awards is totally beyond me.  How it was rated at 87% on rotten tomatoes makes me question humanity.  First off, let's start with how bad of an actor Sean Penn is.  I just didn't buy any of his anger.  At the end when he finds out who the real killers are it doesn't phase him.  He never draws you in at all which makes you not really care that his daughter dies.  It doesn't help that she hardly has any screen time for us to care about her on a more direct level.  Next up is the stupid B plot of Kevin Bacon's estranged wife calling him and not speaking.  Really??  It added absolutely nothing other than being a sort of comic relief to the rest of what is going on.  Sean Penn's gangster friends also added to the camp factor.  Let's not forget the laughable monologue done by his wife at the end.  Next up is how the writer underestimates the viewers' intelligence with the incredibly weak attempt at portraying Tim Robbins' character as the killer.  Tim's wife in the movie was a one trick pony...quiver and grab at the neckline of her shirt.  At the end we find out the two detectives on the case who have left no stone unturned never listened to the 911 tape.  The worst part about the movie is that all the loose ends are tied up, and yet...the movie keeps chugging along!  If you eat dessert after a meal you don't go back for extra servings of the main course.  I would recommend watching this movie only if your life was at stake.

B000000OF6|5.0|If you're a fan of Freddie Mercury and the gang, this is a must-have edition to your music collection.  Classic jams like \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\", \\"Bicycle\\", \\"Fat-Bottomed Girl\\", \\"We Will Rock You\\", \\"We Are The Champions\\" - to name a few - are found on this double disc set.  Excellent and informative inserts with factoids about the band and the music.  Highly Recommended!

0882709194|1.0|Do not buy the version with the intro by Ray Comfort. The intro is dishonest, and attempts to discredit the work of Darwin. There are plenty of other versions, and any one of them would be a fine choice.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|This is a very good book.  However, there are two things I don't like.  First, I really don't like the writing style.  Secondly, the author did not mention what happened to the villagers who saved him.

0671646788|5.0|I just recently read this book after having it sit on my shelf for a couple of years.  It was just what I needed to kick start my life into the right gear.  This book will give you the confidence to move mountains and if you are self employed, in sales or just looking to go to the next level in your life, this book is a must read.
0882709194|1.0|This is the Way of the Master version, not the Julian S. Huxley 150th Anniversary Edition.  The Origin of Species is in the public domain and therefore can be re-printed by any Joe Schmoe, and in this case has been.  If you really want to read the creationist tripe at the beginning of this book, download it for free.  Save your $5 and put it toward the Julian S. Huxley 150th edition.  The ratings here are confusing both books.  Make sure you get the correct one.
B0010YSD7M|4.0|Longtime fan.  Loved the show.<br /><br />Although \\"The Ark of Truth\\" was released in March 2008, I held off watching it until October 2009, primarily to savor what few unviewed SG-1 adventures were left to me.  It was a thrill being back with the SG-1 team as it engaged the Ori one last time.<br /><br />The movie plays like a long episode of \\"Stargate SG-1,\\" with improved special effects and somewhat of a double storyline (i.e. two threats to SG-1, earth, the galaxy, et cetera).  The usual SG-1 team banter is present along with its typical locations of operation: Cheyenne Mountain, forests and space as well as various planets and Ori strongholds.<br /><br />Villain #1 is obviously the Ori and its minions.  When Villain #2 appears, we get somewhat of a regurgitated storyline from a later SG-1 season.  It didn't particularly bother me, but I thought I'd point it out.  I won't reveal Villain #2's identity, but let you discover it for yourself.<br /><br />Another issue is that SG-1 is--once again--reliant on acquiring and implementing Ancient technology (the Ark of Truth) in order to defeat the Ori.  This lends yet another god-from-the-machine-like aspect to the tale, where SG-1 must merely hustle about with lots of derring-do until it finally deploys the technology in a nick-of-time scenario.<br /><br />On to the cast.  Michael Shanks looks somewhat chunkier, but not as much he does in season two of \\"Burn Notice.\\"  Christopher Judge has grown even more hair.  Amanda Tapping, Ben Browder, Claudia Black, Gary Jones and Beau Bridges all look about the same.<br /><br />Overall, an enjoyable adventure.  If more SG-1 is what you want, this shouldn't disappoint.
0061537969|5.0|I avoided this book for a LONG time, because I'd heard about how it was written through a dog's eyes.  I love dogs, but...still. Then a fellow writer-- whose book suggestions have never failed to be on target-- said, \\"You gotta read this.\\"  She was right.  The Art of Racing in the Rain is truly a masterpiece.
B001TK4MO0|5.0|I started to read this book and couldn't put it down. It basically talked about how negative thinking can and WILL prevent you from being happy. It taught how to be aware of your thoughts and how we have several negative thoughts a day that we aren't even aware of. It was the most enlightening thing I had ever read in my life, and it totally changed the way I think and my outlook on life changed.<br /><br />All that happened was a tiny shift in perception and I was more content with my life than I had been in years. I was very aware of my thoughts and was careful not to allow negative thoughts to entertain me, this book taught me- that if I had one at all, to simply acknowledge it, and then gently guide it out.<br /><br />It also taught me how to not have any thoughts at all. Which is VERY hard to do, I mean... how do you NOT think? it wasn't easy to empty my head of all thoughts, but if one can learn to do this, it can be a very enlightening experience. The whole idea behind this is, that there are small gaps of time in between thoughts, which last about one second, if that. That little gap is a quick moment where there is no thinking, and no thought is occupying that short amount of time...  your mind is blank. If there were not this little gap in between thoughts, all of our thoughts would run together and there would be no differentiating between them. This gap between thoughts is a split second, but if you can quiet your mind, and allow yourself to just be, and not think anything, this gap will last longer, and the amount of time in between thoughts becomes longer as you learn to do it, and soon your thoughts could be 1 minute apart as apposed to 1 second apart. Imagine how peaceful that would be!<br /><br />I was never able to keep thoughts from entering my mind for longer than 1 minute because I didn't embrace the amount of patience it took to achieve this, but what I did accomplish by doing this was very beneficial to my mental health and I was able to not think so much, and most importantly, control what I was thinking. I would go days without a negative thought, but the moment one would creep in, I wouldn't deny it occupancy in my mind, I would simply acknowledge it briefly and then guide it out. It was amazing how in control I was over what I thought, thanks to the teachings in this book.<br /><br />This book became like a bible to me, I carried it with me wherever I went, and have loaned it out several times to those I felt would benefit from it's knowledge.<br /><br />After reading it, I became inspired to read all of Deepak Chopra's books, and he is now my favorite author. This man has truly changed my life by changing the way I think.<br /><br />This information to me was priceless compared to the $90 an hour sessions I had with my psychiatrist, not to mention the cost of the medication he prescribed, which turned out to not be effective for me.<br /><br />This book taught me that all I needed to do to be happy was have a tiny shift in perception.<br /><br />I highly recommend the Seven Spiritual Laws of Success to anyone seeking peace of mind. This book teaches you how to be content with your life, the true key to happiness.importantly, control what I was thinking.

B002CMLIJ6|2.0|I just watched the DVD of \\"Wolverine\\" and thought that men made it, for men, and without any heart and soul.  It is full of special effects, no real character development, and few females ...only the weak subservient ones for the strong males.  Hugh Jackman did this for the money.  Anyone can be bought.  It does not have the warmth and camaraderie of the previous three X-Men movies (this could be because of the absent of real, strong, female roles), and there is violence everywhere.  We have become numb to seeing killings on screen.
B0015I2P0Y|5.0|I'm a new Elbow convert. Love this album! There's so much depth of the instrumentation and vocals.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|This movie is a great addition to the game series and if your an Final Fantasy fan as myself( especialy if your an Final Fantasy 7 fan) this movie will answer most questions that the game left unaswered. Thats just the start, this movie in itself is a master piece of its own even if you didnt get or havent playd the game sequel to the movie. I strongly recommend this movie to everyone. It's a show of how beautifull and creative people that works with CGI can get these films to be, just the graphic in itself is amazing in everyway possible.<br /><br />It will take you on a thrilling and beautifull ride that i doubt anyone would forget!<br /><br />To narrow it down to one phrase: It will blow your mind!<br /><br />Enjoy!
0030565812|5.0|It's a great read! But I didn't realize I had bought the abridged edition. Aaaargh. So keep that in mind....the one with the title ending \\"With Connections (HRW Library)\\" is abridged!
B002GYVRRI|5.0|Wow! What an incredible package! This is a total MUST for any fan of this album. I have not evaluated the 5.1 yet but have evaluated the DVD stereo audio, the extras, and the video footage. The sound is simply stunnnig!!  Everything about this is a class effort! Congrats to Steve Wislon for his spectacular input! I am shocked that no-one has posted anything yet! I can't wait to hear the lame vinyl junkies rational for why their original vinyl is somehow better :):))))  This is just fantastic..I cannot wait for the other albums to be released. This may be one of the greatest remasters I have ever heard.  It is incredible how well this album was actually recorded.
0688145078|5.0|I bought this book for my 3.5 year old son to prepare for the arrival of his little sister. He loves this book and we read it several times a week. It is not too long or too wordy. The pictures are cute too. The concepts are easy to understand for a 3.5 year old.
0385504225|1.0|First off, I liked the Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons.  So, I am not a Dan Brown-hater.  But this book was horribly written and horribly plotted.  And, worst of all, the ending, the so-called \\"lost symbol/lost word,\\" was utterly ridiculous...and not \\"lost.\\"  Also, despite promises to the contrary, Brown did not reveal anything significant about the Freemasons.  In fact, it seemed that after all the grief Brown received from the groups he offended with the Da Vinci Code, he went out of his way NOT to offend the Masons.  Instead, he has offended his readers.
B00006I53S|5.0|I've only recently gotten my Canon 40D and, as I said in the title, this lens came with it.  So far, I am really happy with the detail it came capture.      I added an image of a Downy Woodpecker to the images area and the detail of the bird is very good.  I'm still learning how to use my camera and lens, but so far, I am really happy.  The picture was taken late in the afternoon, in the shade.  I couldn't see the bird all that well.  I had the 40D on auto and the lens all the way out (max mag).  I used Picasa to lighten the pic and was really happy with what I ended up with.  It sure didn't look that good in the tree.    I guess, when I get more proficient with the camera, I'll be able to take better photos, but with Picasa, I'll be okay.    Bobby T.
B0010YPTGU|5.0|Excellent production.  This may be the last chance to see Andrea in a pop concert. Highly recommended.

B002IRYYE6|5.0|This is a must own CD if you are a Pretenders fan. When this album first came out, I played it so loud that my landlord nearly evicted me.
B0025KVLU6|4.0|Product was delivered new as specified. Arrived a few days after placing order. Very satisfied.
B000UNYJV8|4.0|Recently saw this movie through my netflix account, and my 19 year old fell in love with it! Very excited to be able to find it on Amazon for an amazing price for his birthday.
B001NXDSLQ|1.0|This guy sends you just the rwo DVDS NOTHING ELSE!!!  NOTHING that was advertised.  All the little extras you don't get.`
B002436WFI|4.0|It is hard to render the written word into a visual form; every reader imagines the story differently. That being said, I enjoyed the movie. It was not like I imagined it but I still found it fun to watch. As an introduction to Terry Pratchett's discworld series it will serve to pique an interest. Plus it was fun to see Pratchett in a cameo role.
B000002L80|5.0|If you are interested in the Talking Heads, but don't know which cd to pick up, this is probably the one you should get.  I would put this cd and Remain In Light at the top of my list for them, amazing set of songs on here.  I definitely recommend it for any music buff.
0439023491|5.0|C'mon, do you really need to check reviews?  If you read THE HUNGER GAMES you know you are going to get this sequel.<br /><br />Katniss and Peeta both survived the Hunger Games, in defiance of the capitol.  There are consequences to her actions which Katniss never anticipated, though -- starting with the President of Panem, who personally wants revenge, and getting even more serious from there.<br /><br />The capitol remains brutal, twisted, and overpowering.  Peeta is still brilliant and endearing, while Katniss continues to be brave, determined, and occasionally flawed.  This is definitely a middle book.  Events progress, and there's a complete plot arc, but no definitive conclusion.  All the pieces are set in motion for the final confrontation in book three.<br /><br />Recommended, provided that you can handle a bit of suspense waiting for the final installment!
B002ELM5HY|5.0|It has all been said, but I wanted to add my voice to all the cheers.  I love this CD.  I think it is his best solo album.  The liner notes are tremendously helpful in providing background stories for these songs.  They are all songs about people on the fringes of society.  There is a definite Celtic flavor to this music.  It is quiet but it definitely does not put me to sleep.  Hard Shoulder is one of the prettiest songs I have ever heard.  Definitely worth a listen - I think I'll put it on right now.
0882709194|1.0|Warning: this version of the book is edited by a young-earth creationist, very much of the original book has been removed and religious text has been inserted with the intention of converting a seminal work of natural history into a fire-and-brimstone religious tract.     It is NOT the famous book by Charles Darwin entitled \\"On the Origin of Species.\\"    Ray Comfort, the televangelist who produced this book, has added a new introduction attempting to refute the contents of the book itself, and drawing comparisons between evolution and the horrors of Nazi Germany.    The text of the classic book has been abridged significantly.  Comfort has removed four chapters, Darwin's introduction and the Glossary.  When you get to page 255 there is a website address that points you to a pdf of some, but not all, of the missing material.    Prior to publication, Ray Comfort emphatically promised multiple times on his blog that he would be publishing Darwin's book in its entirety, \\"every jot and tittle,\\" which turned out to be not true.  He removed four chapters, especially the ones where Darwin offers the most compelling physical evidence.  Also, Comfort used the original version of the book as the basis for this version, so this edition is also lacking an additional fifth chapter where Darwin addresses 'Miscellaneous objections to the Theory of natural Selection'.  Again, telling that Comfort has chosen to remove or discard those parts of the text which most impede his creationist message.      I received a copy of this book for free, stuffed with a religious tract, from a Christian ministry at a swap meet.  I think it's an excellent example of propaganda, and I recommend it to anyone who wishes to teach their children about the dishonesty of propaganda techniques.  This is a book straight out of Orwell's 1984.  A bowdlerized monstrosity which by all rights should cause embarrassment to non-believers and Christians alike.    Ray Comfort sells copies of this book from his ministry by the boxload as a fund-raiser for his ministry.  The intention is to hand these out at college campuses as religious tracts nationwide this November.
0882709194|5.0|I fear things I don't understand and I loathe things that require concentration to read. So it was a grand surprise to see Ray Comfort's introduction to this abridged version of Darwin's book. I didn't really have to think at all. I hope they make a DVD version next, in cartoon format. That would let my spouse enjoy the book too. I'm the first in my family to learn to read. This is pretty good, right? It only took me half an hour.

The Fibbies had circled close, then backed off, and were now chasing who knows who.  Verheek had gotten nowhere, and he was close to the Director.  She would have to piece it together.

B001V9LPWQ|3.0|If you've seen Snow White on VHS and now have a HD TV with Blu-Ray or simply have an upconverting DVD player, you'll enjoy owning this treasure, however ask yourself: \\"Is it worth the money?\\"<br /><br />Consider the following...<br /><br />I love that they've packaged both the Blu-Ray and DVD editions together. Sounds really good doesn't it? Well, it would be if this was a film like say 'Die Hard' that wasn't originally done in older animation-style. Frankly it seemed a bit of a waste to produce this in Blu-Ray as when the DVD was viewed as 'upconverted', the picture looked the same to me as the Blu-Ray.<br /><br />The reason for my 3 out of 5 star rating:<br />Perhaps it's my set-up and the way I'm using it, but if you have a good upconvertion, you may want to save a couple bucks and not spend them on this particular set.<br /><br />I still love the movie, but I don't think I love it 'more' on Blu-Ray.
1579121306|5.0|Frankly, the problems are very simple - mate in 1, mate in 2, and mate in 3. But what this does is to take the untrained, undisciplined mind and gear it to the process of solving problems, thus creating and building a mindset that is analytical. I would liken it to beginning an exercise program. A nice compliment to the beginner's (or someone returning to the game after many years) library.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|I heard all the hype about the Oscar but just recently watched the movie.  I see why it won an Oscar.  I watched the movie with a friend of mine who unfortunately cannot stay awake for more than 15 minutes of ANY movie.  This movie was so good that he stayed awake and fully engaged in the movie.  I was blown away, the child actors are EXCELLENT! They did an awesome job of casting these kids, you actually feel their emotion.  I liked the scene where Jamal is dancing in front of Latika as they wait to be called into the torture chamber. Yes, the idea that love conquers is not just romantic but the very truth, if you seek it and work for it as Jamal did.  Overall, a wonderful movie, I've seen few movies as good as this one! Just as importantly, the poverty levels shown in India can be found in MANY countries around the world.  It makes my heart ache to think about how many kids live, sleep and eat in landfills....this is not fantasy people, it's everyday life for millions of innocent children!!!!!!
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|OK, so we have too many italics all over the place. In fact, way too many!  And we have some overheated family discusssions, and even a little purple prose. Plus, the book might be a bit long..But for a zany tour thru some obvious and probably underappreciated DC highlights, Dan once again leads the pack. The twist at the end, another Brown trump-card, did not strike me as a surprise either. But if there is a better page-turner, more informative about \\"Secret History\\" (exempting Dan's other books!), let me know, and I'll check them out. And the very last lines are keepers, not to mention the last word. Mr. Brown leads the pack, and for good reasons: amazing research, a real \\"you are there\\" style; taut descriptions;action written as well as anyone else out there..the list goes on....So, I'll accept all the \\"My God\\" italics, and look forward to this great author's next one.
