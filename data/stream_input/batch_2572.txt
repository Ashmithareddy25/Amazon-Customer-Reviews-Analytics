B0095ZMMCK|1.0|Poor writing. The story was decent but the author writes like an elementary student.  Sad to see Tom Clancy`s name attached to this.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie in the theaters, but as a video it still does not disappoint.  The story itself flows well, and the imagery is really good.  Not to mention the fact that there are a few good lessons to be learned.
B00C2U6G7C|3.0|Notes are an integral part of music, are they not? Lack of notes means a more limited creative process... in other words, less chance of creating beautiful emotional melodies.<br /><br />Nowadays, both in movies and music, technology has become more important than storytelling or musical ideas; digital effects are becoming more and more popular in achieving an empty sense of grandeur. Zimmer was very creative when I first listened to his score for \\"The Lion King\\" in 1994. A few years later came Gladiator (2000), The Last Samurai (2003), King Arthur (2004), Batman Begins (2005), The Holiday (2006), Pirates: At World's End (2007)... we are talking about six unique beautiful soundtracks in seven years (almost one per year). After the third Pirate's movie in 2007 I just can't come up with any other truly amazing Zimmer soundtrack that tops one of these and doesn't sound repetitive. Pirates 4, Inception, Sherlock Holmes and The Dark Knight Rises were all bad for me with the last one being especially mediocre, although I have to admit that Sherlock Holmes, at least, sounded fresh but never to the heights of the previously mentioned scores.<br /><br />Zimmer has proudly simplified his formula now to two or three note statements whenever he wants to compose a new main theme (after The Last Samurai and Batman Begins he used this minimalistic approach to write \\"Chevaliers de Sangreal\\" in The Da Vinci Code, \\"Time\\" in Inception and never expanded it for the Batman franchise in \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\". Few notes reverberating repeatedly with massive digital effects and percussion have made Zimmer, in the past few years, a very fine arranger with a limited scope for notes. The main theme for Man of Steel is also composed of two notes that rise over each other (\\"Look to the stars\\" and the last portion of \\"What are you going to do when you are not saving the world\\").<br /><br />So we have music lacking in complexity and filled with digital effects and percussion to exalt the few melodies written for the film; this can, to some extent, convey a sense of initial awe if you have a very good speaker system but the awe does not come from the melody, just from the imposing effects around it (a good arranger after all).<br /><br />Man of Steel is a blend of atmospheric music with imposing beats. It's fun but not quite original as a standalone musical experience and, most certainly, we have mixtures of Zimmer's past better works... the main drumbeat in \\"If You Love These People\\" is the same one used in King Arthur at the ending of \\"Woad to Ruin\\" and the nostalgic violins in \\"Krypton's Last\\" are almost the same ones heard at 6:20-7:50 in \\"Science & Religion\\" from Angels & Demons. The initial pace heard after the piano in \\"What are you going to do when you are not saving the world\\" has hints from \\"Homeland\\" of Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron.<br /><br />Overall, this score is more action packed with atmospheric cues and a few emotional highlights (\\"This is Clark Kent\\", \\"Goodbye My Son\\" and \\"Krypton's Last\\"). The imposing goosebump highlight might be found in \\"If you love these people\\"... analogous to \\"Like a dog chasing cars\\" in The Dark Knight album.<br /><br />Since this latest cinematic approach for Superman is more human, dramatic, dark and flawed, Zimmer applied the same formula used in The Dark Knight: a dark atmospheric score that really doesn't deliver the \\"Everything good in America\\" experience he initially had in mind. Being done deliberate or not, I would like to state that after releasing the short album for The Dark Knight Rises with almost no new material written for the closing movie of this amazing trilogy, Man of Steel is definitely a much more cohesive and elaborate album that, although using the same minimalistic formula, has some true emotional and imposing moments; they might not be whistled by people after watching the movie but they will definitely help audiences immerse themselves into the light and tense moments of this new Man of Steel.<br /><br />*<br />Highlight Emotional Tracks:<br />  5.

B00A8MGLAI|5.0|This was one of my all-time favorite movies of 2012.  I waited (not so patiently) for the video version to come out, and bought the Blu-ray/DVD combo because there are some movies that just SHOULD be seen in Blu-ray, but I like to  share, and not everyone has the player, so the DVD is handy to have.  The story and images are rich with color and detail.  I think there are people with strong beliefs one way or the other that will be offended, but for most of us, it's a fantastic movie.  The truth is, we ARE all connected, and we DO all affect one another, and our actions (whether good or bad) affect the future.  Fantastic flick.
B008EKOIN8|5.0|it has been a little hard to get through the book b/c the author goes into detail about the condition of the animals before they are cooked. it was hard to read about the poor hogs/pigs who live in horrible conditions on corporate farms. but the book is quite excellent overall.

0345525558|5.0|I liked the clever use of symbology of flowers and life's problems for a young woman caught in the foster system. Victoria cannot always express herself verbally , but her second language becomes the language of flowers.  It is a story of hurt and guilt  and human relationships,told beautifully.The characters were realistically drawn. I did not always like the back and forth rrythm of the author's style, but overall  the book deserves five stars.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|WHILE I HAVE NOT READ THE MANY BOOKS ABOUT TOLKIEN'S HOBBIT, I HAVE READ TOLKIEN'S BOOK, THE HOBBIT, SEVERAL TIMES, AND HAVE SEEN PETER JACKSON'S MOVIE. EVEN THOUGH JACKSON IS PRODUCING A TRILOGY, WHICH LOOKS LIKE IT WILL ENCOMPASS BOTH THE HOBBIT AND PARTS OF THE SILMARILLION, VIEWING THE FIRST PART OF THE MOVIE TRILOGY I FOUND BOTH ENTERTAINING AND FILLED WITH SPECIAL EFFECTS IN ORDER TO PORTRAY BILBO'S ADVENTURE. WHILE MOVIES SELDOM FOLLOW THE BOOK THEY ARE BASED ON, THIS ONE IS BETTER THAN MOST. I ESPECIALLY LIKE, SPEAKING FOR MYSELF, THE PORTRAYAL OF GALADRIEL. SHE COMES ACROSS AS A TRUE, A BEAUTIFUL, QUEEN, ALWAYS SEEKING MEANS TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE OF MIDDLE EARTH. THE PORTRAYAL OF THRAIN IS VERY WELL DONE, AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THIS CHARACTOR. SO, ENJOY THE MOVIE, AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVEN'T, READ THE BOOK! RQ
0316247545|5.0|The book was amazingly written. It had all of it! Song lyrics, Episode guides, Character bios, Even a map of eqeustria! It had beautifull cover art and pre-production art. Any fan from any age would enjoy this book. It has dialoge between the characters in the back and front page. Truely better than expected!
B00009L1UP|5.0|Seattle based prog metal masters Queensryche's fourth studio album entitled Empire was released in September of 1990.<br />The prog-tinged metal quintet, which comprised of lead singer Geoff Tate, guitarists Chris DeGarmo and Michael Wilton, bass player Eddie Jackson and drummer Scott Rockenfield had finally hit paydirt with 1988's Operation: Mindcrime and also opening for bands who shared Queensryche's management at the time (Q Prime) like Def Leppard (huge with their Hysteria album at the time) and Metallica on their And Justice For All Tour didn't hurt. With the success of Mindcrime, the band and returning producer Peter Collins (whom first came to prominence with his work with Rush) and an also returning engineer James \\"Jimbo\\" Barton (whom was the right hand man of Collins) went to the studio to work on Mindcrime's followup. Would the album be great or the band be a one-album wonder. For me it was the former (as I found out as I grabbed the cassette in April of 1991 after my best friend played me the album a few months earlier and impressed this hard rock/metal/prog fan here).<br />We start things with DeGarmo's \\"Best I Can\\" which is an uplifting rocker with some of his finest guitar work and positive lyrics. The song was the album's second single and one of the reasons why I grabbed the album. \\"The Thin Line\\" is next and is a great song with DeGarmo and Wilton's collaboration with Tate on a great song. The album's fourth single \\"Jet City Woman\\" is next and Jackson's bass guitar sets the tone and DeGarmo again write the music to this great rocker. We follow with the epic \\"Della Brown\\" which is an awesome track. Eddie's bass starts us off again and features a brilliant solo by DeGarmo in the middle whilst Wilton does a phenomenal solo at the end. Next is the album's fifth single \\"Another Rainy Night (Without You)\\" which is another winner of a track and includes a great solo from Wilton and just a great rocker. The title track (which closed side 1 of the cassette) is next and what a rocker this is. Wilton wrote the music and played the soaring solos and Tate's lyrics make it a home run and this track was a fitting pick for the album's first single.<br />The second half of the album opens with \\"Resistance\\" Wilton's musical rocker (with lyrics by Tate) and is a heavy rocker (this track would be the opening song on the accompanying Building Empires Tour which carried on into 1992). Next is DeGarmo's baby of a piece and the album (and band's) biggest hit \\"Silent Lucidity\\". This Top 10 hit reminds one of Pink Floyd (and no surprise as the band (in particular DeGarmo) are Floyd fans and also featured orchestrations by the late Michael Kamen who worked with Pink Floyd, Rush, Queen and many others) and is a great song about dreams. We follow with the DeGarmo/Wilton/Tate collaboration \\"Hand On Heart\\" which is another brilliant rocker which picks up the pace of the album in a good way. Next is another heavy rocker \\"One and Only\\" which was a collaboration between DeGarmo and Wilton and just a barnstorming hard rocker. The album ends with \\"Anybody Listening\\" which was also coincidentally the album's last single. This track is a great epic and what a way to end the album. Some may call this \\"The Brother of Silent Lucidity\\" but unlike \\"Lucidity\\", the choruses are heavy.<br />Empire would climb all the way to #7 in the US in 1991 and gave Queensryche their second Platinum album and their best seller with three million in US sales alone.<br />In 2003, the album was re-released in a digitally remastered version with three bonus tracks which were \\"Last Night in Paris\\" which was recorded during the album's sessions but left off and inserted on the soundtrack to the Andrew Dice Clay (who remembers him) flop Ford Fairlane. The track rocks and was played regularly on the Empire Tour. Next is a cover of Simon and Garfunkel's \\"Scarborough Fair\\" which was rumored to be recorded during the Rage For Order sessions but was mixed during the Empire sessions. We close with the rocker \\"Dirty Lil Secret\\" which is another great rocker. Plus the CD comes with two booklets. One was the original that came with the original CD (artwork, lyrics and credits) and another which has photos, essay and extra credits.<br />RECOMMENDED!ons.

0307341577|4.0|Libby is just hard to like, and that's what makes this book so great-- she is not going to pour her heart out to you, and she isn't going to apologize for her failings, which are many.  I haven't read Gone Girl yet, but I do recommend Dark Places for a moody, disfunctional gothic thriller.
B0000931QA|5.0|Seattle based hard rockers Queensryche's third album Operation: Mindcrime was released in April of 1988.<br />The prog-tinged metal quintet, which comprised of lead singer Geoff Tate, guitarists Chris DeGarmo and Michael Wilton, bass player Eddie Jackson and drummer Scott Rockenfield, had released a modestly received self-titled EP and two full length albums (their classic debut 1984's The Warning and the equally impressive followup 1986's Rage For Order) which tanked. Despite opening up for great legendary hard rock and metal bands such as AC/DC, KISS and Iron Maiden plus hair metal junk trash like Ratt and Bon Jovi, commercial success ignored Queensryche until Operation Mindcrime.<br />Operation: Mindcrime is a concept album, in the vain of other classic concept albums like Pink Floyd's The Wall, Genesis' The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway and The Who's Tommy. Mindcrime tells the story of an anarchist named Nikki whose disillusionment with Reagan-era American society leads him to join a shadowy plot to assassinate corrupt leaders. Lyrically, this was Geoff Tate's baby though musically DeGarmo and Wilton made the album what it is (as I found out when I first acquired the cassette in May of 1991 just two weeks after I acquired the band's 1990 followup Empire (review soon)).<br />\\"I Remember Now\\" begins the album in a hospital ward where Nikki after a pain shot from a British nurse who calls him an obscenity and recalls the recent rash of murders he may or may not have committed at the request of Doctor X. \\"Anarchy-X\\" is next and is a killer overture to the album. \\"Revolution Calling\\" follows and gets more into the nitty gritty of our anti-hero Nikki, a psychotic, cynical individual who was recruited and brainwashed by the infamous Dr. X who was a power crazed evangelical preacher, leader of 'The Order', to be his personal assassin. The title track is next and has Nikki addicted to drugs and brainwashed by Dr. X. Next is \\"Speak\\" which is a driving rocker which sends Nikki first out to kill an unnamed corrupt politician. \\"Spreading the Disease\\" is next and is about Mary, a prostitute, whom Nikki tries to save by getting a priest to take her off the streets. This track rocks, especially Rockenfield's powerful drumming. \\"The Mission\\" (lone track which Tate didn't write the lyrics as it was penned by DeGarmo) is next and is possibly DeGarmo's best track he ever wrote himself for Queensryche and professed Nikki's love for Mary.<br />The second half of the album opens with the epic \\"Suite Sister Mary\\" which opens with Dr. X ordering Nikki to go out and kill Mary and the priest after which the track opens with a solo melodic guitar and a Choir which goes on to accompany Tate throughout the song. The number is a wonderful confluence of rock/metal and opera with Pamela Moore singing superbly the role of Mary. Next is another killer rocker \\"The Needle Lies\\" which was about Nikki's love for drugs turning bad. \\"Electric Requiem\\" is next and is the track which has Nikki discover his beloved Mary had been murdered. \\"Breaking the Silence\\" is next and has Nikki seeing and hearing Mary in his head and a great rocker. \\"I Don't Believe in Love\\" is next and is a great rocker which had our character Nikki deny his love for Mary because he cannot face the fact that she died. This track was a major hit on rock radio. \\"Waiting For 22\\" is a great instrumental with some great guitar work from DeGarmo. \\"My Empty Room\\" is next and has our anti-hero Nikki wondering about what has become of him and what he will do. The album ends with Queensryche's first big rock radio smash \\"Eyes of a Stranger\\". This track is a great song and what a way to end the album. Some think Nikki dreamed this and some thought he committed suicide but we wouldn't find out his fate until 2006's lackluster sequel Operation:Mindcrime II.<br />The original Operation: Mindcrime peaked at #50 in 1989 and gave Queensryche their first US Gold album (eventually Platinum).<br />For the album's 15th anniversary in 2003, the album was re-released in a digitally remastered CD version with two bonus tracks which were a live version of \\"The Mission\\" recorded in 1990 at The Hammersmith Odeon, London and \\"My Empty Room\\" recorded in October of 1994 in London. Also comes with a booklet chock full of photos, essay on the album, lyrics and credits. Then another reissue would emerge in 2006 with a live version of Mindcrime on CD number 2.<br />RECOMMENDED!th anniversary in 2003, the album was re-released in a digitally remastered CD version with two bonus tracks which were a live version of \\"The Mission\\" recorded in 1990 at The Hammersmith Odeon, London and \\"My Empty Room\\" recorded in October of 1994 in London.

B008IJT0CE|4.0|Love this app. So many choices to help you reach your Zen place. A couple sounds have a tiny, recurring sound in the background - just enough to make me anticipate it each time. That's the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.  However, the fact you can set a timer and mix sounds to come up with your own special combination makes up for it.  I use this app every night!
B0084AXZK0|5.0|As a very brief summary I can say that I enjoyed this book immensely from cover to cover. I wish that I came across more books like this one but having just finished it I, like many readers, will be more careful what I wish for.<br /><br />Like so many great books it has a truly ageless quality. Even though the setting is not of this time, the characters could just as easily be transported to the present day. A very fast paced and extremely witty dialogue that keeps you hooked.<br /><br />At the end though, despite this being a tale of the demise of the soul, it’s not a moralising account by any stretch. I found it to be a story about choices, balance and a great commentary on the fleeting whims of society.<br /><br />For many readers too I think you will find this to be a wonderful source of Wilde’s famous quotations. They take on a new life when read in context so this adds an extra layer of enjoyment.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was an excellent escape game. Not terribly difficult but enough to make it really fun. Each level became slightly more challenging and clever! There are only 8 levels but it says there will be more. The sooner the better.
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|Huge fan on Die Hard, Die Hard with a Vengeance, and an average fan of Die Hard 2.  Didn't like Live Free or Die Hard because of multiple reasons.  Had high hopes for this but to tell you the truth, it was boring.  A car chase scene that seemed like it would never end, plot with some twists but didn't trigger the shock that a twist should because I didn't know the bad guys enough for it to be a shock, and other reasons that I don't feel like typing out.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I know people are pissed off because there are more books, but if you have been following the series at all you would have seen on social medias the announcement of more books prior to the release of this book!  As for the review, it is about the book not about the # of freaking books in a storyline.<br /><br />I love the storyline.  I was worried about reading it thinking that the story was going to be ruined based on the reviews, but so totally not the case.  I loved every piece of it.  I think the additional character developments are going to bring something to the table in the next books and I am looking forward to them very much.  Gideon and Eva are hot as ever and the twist and turns were wonderful.  Eva is growing a backbone and it is awesome to see if come to light.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Just like bejewels. It's not too complicated. Good for all ages.<br />I like how it feels like never ending because of the many levels they offer.

B0080CKGZE|2.0|It just didn't seem accurate to the time. It was difficult to follow as the theme seemed unclear and not exciting.
B002ZG98ZA|2.0|Loved the series, quite liked the first film however, this is beyond bad.<br />Right from the start, with a barely alive Liza Minelli singing and dancing (watch your hips, luv), this film is like a bad copy of the original. The ladies come across as a bunch of spoilt witches and frankly, they are not surviving the move to high definition very well. Finally, there is a horrible, borderline racist thread running through this film, especially when they decamp to the Middle East. How dare they mock women for wearing their traditional dress in their country? And of course they had to make out that these women wear Prada and the like under their dress because that's what all women should do. I think the Middle Eastern women looked far better than the aging foursome.<br />Sorry, but this film just left a bad taste in my mouth. I wanted to like it, but I just couldn't. One extra star for a few giggles throughout the film.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Who can resist perky music and cute jiggley monsters? I enjoy puzzle games and this one does not disappoint. Lots of changing levels keeps me playing without getting board. Do wish ZeptLab games could recognize their games you already own so you don't keep getting the pop up to buy them.

B007XKEY6Q|3.0|Great app to play pictionary type game with, and you can earn coins to unlock more colors to draw with.<br /><br />Reason I stopped playing it is because other players often give up and will just write out the clue instead of drawing it... when all five of my current games came to this, I uninstalled the app. Guys, really... just draw something.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Can't say much more about it, I'm not a good movie reviewer.  It's all based on your personal opinions.  And my opinion is that almost every facet of this movie is top notch and phenomenal.  Can't wait to see more Tarantino, he may be weird and abrasive but he makes great movies.

It's got tons of brush options, handy dandy places to save your brushes, layer support, you can change opacity, hardness, spacing, and more in your brushes...<br /><br />My beef is that the Undo and Redo shortcuts don't work on my Kindle Fire, which makes it very frustrating to use. I'm not the only one with this problem on the Kindle, but their support page shows no sign that they know or care about our complaints. To be fair, it's not an iPad.<br /><br />Definitely worth 5 bucks, but if you're a Kindle user beware. If I could use the shortcuts I'd give it a higher rating, or if someone from Autodesk had responded to the problem in the four months it's been since the initial complaint. /shrug<br /><br />***********************************************************************************************<br />Update 3.22.14<br /><br />I just launched the program on my same Kindle and looks like they updated it; there's a new, easier to use interface, and the UNDO and REDO shortcuts work! Yay Autodesk thank youuuuuuuuuuuuu
B00009AOBI|5.0|Cher outdoes herself in this movie about her son who seems freakish to anyone who doesn't already know his kind and compassionate heart. Sam Elliot is a strong presence for both the boy as well as for his mother, who needs to overcome her drug habit in order to appreciate her son for who he is..as time is short in his world. A tear jerker, I cried for about 10 minutes after the film was over.

B005MLOOJA|5.0|I missed the Good Wife when it was actually on TV because it must have either been on too late or conflicted with another show that I had already been watching.  So when I got Amazon Prime and realized I could watch tv show seasons, the Good Wife came up and I though &#34;eh, what the heck?&#34;  The only thing I even knew about the show is that it had my favorite actor from &#34;Dead Poets Society&#34; and that at some point he kisses Alicia in an elevator.  (trailers.  lol.)  I absolutely love, love, love the show and am so glad I gave it a try.  I wanted to be a lawyer when I graduated high school, but didn't really have the cut-throat drive to make it happen...so this is kind of my way of living a &#34;what if&#34; kind of scenario in the comfort of my bed.  With wine and chocolate.  lol.  A TRUE guilty pleasure.  I am constantly rooting for Will and Alicia to &#34;get it on&#34;...and I am rooting for Calinda and Carey....or really, Calinda and anyone.  Also, I am honing my &#34;poker face&#34; because they certainly have them on this show!
B00CL68NOG|4.0|For some reason I can't not watch every movie with Barbara in it, she brings a raw realism to her characters that anyone feels like they could be here friend.....I guess she is just NORMAL! Not a huge Seth Rogen fan, but, I am comming around, he takes some getting used to. This movie encompasses everything real about Mother/Son relationships. The love, the embarassment, the uniqueness and even the weirdness. In the end this movie proves that subtlety is a more powerful ending than even dynomite.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Petty officer Kyle shares his life journey with candor and nicely makes his case for family, God and country.  There is no un-necessary grisly detail but the message is clear.  Writing style and editing is not distracting very readable.

B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Great Tom Cruise flick - Jack Reacher is cool as a cucumber.  The driving he did in this pic is also awesome.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Zombie, Love Triangles what more could anyone ask for? Walking dead is so much more than Zombies, the story and complexity of the characters bring this comic book hero to life and expose him for just what he is....human. It is not without it's sadness and overwhelming feelings of hopelessness, yet somehow, at the same time, shows the resilience of the human spirit! BEST SHOW I HAVE EVER SEEN! Addicted! I watch a lot of TV so that says alot!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I work overnight, and this app is very helpful when it comes to a restful day of sleep. It helps block outside noises well, and the variety of sounds is great. It really doesn't drain the battery on my Kindle Fire like I thought it would, either. This app is definitely one of my most-used apps. I'd buy again with no hesitation.<br /><br />Update 11/30/2014<br />After 18-ish months of using this app, I am still using it EVERY day that I sleep (I don't use it to sleep at night, because there is much less outside noise).  I love that I can create my own mixes (up to five sounds) and change the pitch of the sounds.  I sleep much more soundly with this app running - it drowns out neighborhood noises well.  It also has a timer and an alarm clock built in.  You can taper down (or turn off abruptly) the sound at a chosen time so it doesn't muffle your separate alarm, or you can set it to change to a specific sound at a chosen time to help you wake up.  There are new sounds added all the time to the store, and they're always free to add to your device.  You can preview them before downloading, so you don't add sounds that you won't use.  All in all, a great app, highly recommended.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|I don't know what critics are talking about! Jeremy Renner in addition to being a much more believable action star is just a plain better actor. Matt Damon was boring and just plain unsympathetic in his character. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and it brought me back to Bourne.
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|Just watched it last night I truly enjoyed it.<br />the dark forest and grave yard scene was nostalgic of early 60's horror films looked amazing.<br />hate to see all the negative reviews oooooooooo well.<br />Wonder if Pink Floyd goes with this one also gonna have to buy to find out.
B0031Q0XCA|1.0|To be fair they did tell you in the first line of dialogue that &#34;this is not a love story&#34;! But, it was marketed that way. I do not think it really made sense and really wasted the talent of these two enjoyable actors.
B000002ITW|5.0|This classic stands the test of time, showcasing the incredible harmonies and songwriting of one of the greatest super-groups of the era.
B00COHIFQS|4.0|Just watch it ......one of the better horror movies i seen in awhile. worth the money four more words ok
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham (as usual) weaves a great story that keep the reader thinking until well into the book.  The combination of first person and omniscient narrators is developed very effectively to provide the reader all the information needed to enjoy the book, but conceals the twists in the plot until just the right moment.  An excellent read!
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Really enjoyed this story and loved the way the author handled the emotions of the two main characters. It gave me a good insight into a disabled person's life.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|THis book is an amazing novel. the details re fantastic and kept me reading to the end. I wold recommend it!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|After watching the first season, I was hooked! It is so addictive and each episode leaves you wanting to keep watching.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. You don't need to see the original &#34;Django&#34; to keep up with it. The original Django actually has a cameo in the movie. It is very entertaining, with.funny moments too.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|Difficult for me to follow along with the story... that said, it was still interesting to watch. You just have to &#34;roll with it&#34; if you going to enjoy this film.
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|This movie rocked! It is an amazing drama. It is a great movie, whether you're watching it alone or with your partner. I was glued to this movie til the end. I don't want to give away anything. Just trust me--watch this movie!
B007PFDJH4|3.0|McEwan's later books are becoming a bit tedious. I get to the end, but dont really engage and this one was no exception.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|This movie wasn't the most amazing comedy created, but it was pretty funny, and engaging. It didn't have boring spots. It was a pretty good movie, for only having one big-name actor in it--and John Malcovich was not in that much of the movie.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|Was so glad to see Eureka on Amazon Prime; this show was not given the proper respect and kudos it deserved for being on SyFy and staying creative and ridiculously smart. Kind of hoped it would get revived or sold to another network but I have to imagine the production costs were not feasible.<br /><br />As for the instant stream quality, Amazon's service did a great job with video and audio quality. I have it hooked up to my Roku and PS3 and use the service frequently!
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|This movie was a huge let down. I thought it would have more Cobalt War content, and deal more with Lincoln's life. It is all about the politics of the emancipation of slavery. If you love to watch politicians lobby, you will love this movie. Lincoln's assassination, John Wilkes Booth, or any of the events immediately following his assassination were just forgotten.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|Everyone should immerse themselves in this book.  Replace Nigeria with wherever you're from and it will relate to you too.  The author has yet again done an excellent job telling a beautiful story.
B00005JM02|1.0|This disc didnt work and they said I could keep it? Would have like to be given a different one that worked. Still looking for a replacement
B000P0J09W|5.0|I have watched this show 101 times and will watch it that many more<br />Great show for any age.  Everyone will watch this over and over.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game! I like it because you have to have skills, practice, and in a way, agility! You have to be able to move your fingers across the screen fast enough to move your character out of the path of moving/ standing trains.Yet also you are being chased by a police man and his Chihuahua dog! ( Its not really a Chihuahua but it is so small they have  to be cousins or something!)If you want to figure out more , or see others hilarious details of the game, or something else that involves Subway Surfers ,You need to try it out for your self!!
B00B2PHSIY|5.0|I'm not having any of the same issues everyone else is having. I was able to download and instal the firmware the first time.

B00BDSRISA|3.0|For some reason I thought there were bonus tracks. There were not. This CD is just Ok - maybe it will grow on me.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I got minecraft thinking is was like the pc version but it has no enemy's and it needs the same blocks or stuff as the pc version but totally worth your time just needs kept u p
B006XF5BTG|5.0|This is by far the best book i have come across for weightlifting, dieting, and overall health and wellness. The book is a very easy read, packed with tons of factual information based on studies performed at numerous universities. I have been actively working out for over 10 years. I feel i have a pretty good grasp on what I am doing. But there are so many things that I was going wrong.<br /><br />The dieting tips in this book alone make it well worth it. On top of that he goes into deep detail outlining the steps necessary to bulk, as well as cut weight. I cant say enough about how much i love this book. it is literally a Bible to me.
B0036EH3UC|5.0|As someone who was born in the mid-1970's and was a child of the 80's, I grew up knowing about \\"Battlestar Galactica\\" as a short-lived, sort of cool science fiction show that was also very campy and corny (a hallmark of most tv series from the mid-70's to late-80's).  It was entertaining to watch whenever it was on, but there was no great motivation to make it `appointment television'.  So, in 2003, when the Sci-Fi Channel decided to launch a re-imagined version of \\"Battlestar Galactica\\", there was no great pull for me to watch it.<br /><br />  Now, fast forward to 2011, a couple years after the re-imagined show concluded.  Amazon had the complete series on DVD available for a great deal.  So, I decided to take a shot and get it.  I can say, without a doubt, that where it applies to my television viewing history, this is probably one of the best decisions I have ever made.  From the moment I put the pilot mini-series in my DVD player, I could not stop watching it.  I would go on marathons where I would watch anywhere from 4-6 episodes in one sitting.  Then, a year later, I did it all again.  As I'm typing this review, I'm craving a third run through the series.<br /><br />  Rebooting \\"Battlestar Galactica\\" was a risky proposition, at best, because of the small, but extremely committed and vocal fanbase that developed over the years (not unlike the `Browncoats' for \\"Firefly\\").  They were fiercely loyal to the original series and wanted to see it brought back to television with all the same people.  At the vanguard of this movement was actor Richard Hatch (not to be confused with the first winner of \\"Survivor\\"), who portrayed Apollo on the original series.  He kept interest in the show going with BSG novels that he wrote and frequent appearances at science fiction conventions.  When the re-imagined mini-series was announced, Hatch (and the original loyalists), were bitterly disappointed.  How could so many changes be made?  How could Starbuck be a woman?<br /><br />Fortunately, for all parties involved, creator Ronald Moore knew what he was doing.  He kept the very essence of the show intact, which was about humanity's struggle for survival after a brutal holocaust brought about by the evil, robot Cylons.  In the re-imagined series, the attack was much more shocking and visceral and it set the tone for the intensity of the rest of series.<br /><br />  In addition to keep the core plot of the show similar, Moore also made a clever tactical move by reaching out to Richard Hatch at a convention following the airing of the mini-series.  He explained his vision for the new series and how it was still honoring the old one.  The result was that Hatch accepted (meaning many of the loyalists did, too) and even took the role of the Tom Zarek in the new series, with a seminal moment being a scene between him and Jamie Bamber (the new Apollo), which served as a metaphorical passing of the torch.<br /><br />  Still led by Commander Adama (played with fierce dignity by Edward James Olmos) and partnered with President Laura Roslyn (Mary McDonnell, in a truly elevating role in her already considerable career), the `ragtag' human fleet staves off extinction at the hands of the Cylons while addressing many internal issues that also threatened humanity's survival.  Aired only a few years after 9/11, and as the Iraq War started, \\"Battlestar Galactica\\" did not shy away from the tough storylines:  survivor's guilt; imprisonment and torture; the cost and method of war; the role of civilians during times of crisis.<br /><br />  Each of the characters, from the humanoid Cylons to the varied military and civilian humans, is a well-developed three-dimensional person.  They each have to fight the battles within themselves while also fighting the battles outside.  This series is full of top-notch drama, sci-fi action sequences that top many you will see on the big screen, and some of the most shocking (yet honest) plot twists in TV history.<br /><br />  Ihave thoroughly enjoyed watching this series and talking about it every chance I get.  Come to think of it, after writing this review, I may just start watching it again!
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|great read, one of my favorite authors. ms.Singh wrapped up a lot of loose ends with this book. loved it!
B000FC1AGG|5.0|Emma has been out of the country on business at one of her company's corporate offices and is headed back home. She has an extremely long flight ahead of her and she does not like to fly...not one single bit! She decides that perhaps she needs a drink to settle her nerves. Her plan to relax definitely works, maybe a little too much as she loses her verbal filter and begins chatting up to the handsome male passenger seated next to her. She tells him ALL her secrets, including everything from when she lost her virginity to the down & dirty office politics at her company. As Emma safely disembarks the plane, she is a little more clear-headed, and slightly embarrassed by her uncharacteristic rant. But she has comfort in the fact that she will never ever have to face the attractive, attentive stranger again and her confidences will remain in tact. Unfortunately for Emma, the stranger turns out to be the enigmatic, Jack Harper, CEO of her company! The perils that follow are laugh out loud hilarious! Not to mention the chemistry between Emma and Jack are palpable and their banter is downright entertaining! He teases her relentlessly with the information she armed him with and he makes her squirm...in more than ways than one!!!
B002SSUQFG|5.0|It's slightly smaller than I expected but still has some weight to it.  Makes a great casual watch for daily wear.
B00957T6X6|4.0|Finally made it through. Painful. Bile inducing, angry tirade producing scenes. Sad. I'm betting the series ends with no humans left- just others and dragons.
B00006LLLN|5.0|Don't usually like live concert music, but this is really good. Have the same CD in non-concert form, Krauss is the best.
B00AWJYJVA|4.0|le Carre annoys the hell out of me with his &#34;I say old chap&#34; style of conversation. I have sworn never to read him again because of that. However, there is less than usual of that highly stylised conversation in this book. And as always there is a compelling story. le Carre's stories and tension always draw me back - and this one doesn't disappoint. A big vote of approval.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|If you want a good laugh, watch Paul.  It's one of those movies that you have to listen to every line in, or you will miss the humor that is interjected many times.  I've watched it several times and still get a kick out of it.
098555780X|5.0|The directions are easy to follow with clear pictures of each step.  Makes a great gift along with some paracord.
0790737345|5.0|If you love someone, hold them close, as nobody knows when our last day on Earth will be.  This movie is a beautiful reminder of how precious life is.

1475972350|5.0|Time Killer grabbed me by the hair, giving me front-row passes to a jaw-droppingly brutal murder scene executed by a deranged killer on page one.<br /><br />I found this book particularly interesting for the unique experience with the villain: the reader is privy to his every murder, his every ruse, manipulation, and charade. He is a serial killer, targeting a huge demographic of people, which left me, as a reader, shocked at his total absence of empathy. The story unravels creatively, first allowing the witness of murder, and then the escalation of murder, as the killer moves toward more personal targets and becomes frustrated, revealing pieces of his broken mind. The killer isn't just a twisted killer, he's a disturbed man with a disturbed past, and as much as I wanted justice and knew it was inevitable, I was on the seat of my pants reading to learn more about the villain, and what he would do next.<br /><br />Max and Jesse are lovable characters, each a perfect fit for the job. Max's relationship with his car and bachelor life had me rolling with laughter, but he has some deep ties to family and nightmares of his own to confront. There is tension, friendship, and an evolution of trust between the two. There's a nice balance of character depth, without the weight of brooding or excessive sentimentality, making it easy to sail through pages.<br /><br />Topping an excellent cast, there are a number of unexpected plot twists that made the book a joyride, including ghosts from the past concerning Max and the villain. Max hatches a master plan that kept me guessing until the last few pages of the book.<br /><br />Time Killer is fast, fun, and suspenseful, and the unique character personalities are what really make the book shine.

B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|Found this to be a pretty good game...a little short for my liking. Also found some of the HO hard to find, found myself using the hint button much more than I usually do . Worth the price of the game.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I can get bored with the whole farmville themes quickly but I love finding nemo so I like this game!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|It's very challenging with many options to choose from. If you like a challenge you will like this game. Try it now.
B000UAE7RW|5.0|One of my favorites of all time . . . the setting, acting and super story.  Would recommend to anyone who likes movies of the 1930s and love of cars . . . the yellow packard.
B008K8VDPU|3.0|Interesting app but no real use for it. This is why I don't like this rating service, don't have twelve words to write about it.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This is an addicting show; the story lines and character portrayal is excellent.  It is highly recommended.  3 more words.
1781162646|3.0|I cannot review this book in all honesty since I don't read Stephen King. These books were purchased for my son-in-law and his son-in-law who are great fans. I am sure they will enjoy it.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|After seeing the movie, we just wanted to stay with the mood so ordered the soundtrack.  It has both new and old style Hawaiian music.  When I play it, it always seems too short--I wish it would go on and on...
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Nice game demo a little too short. Could be longer to open more skills. Other an that it has great graphics<br />.
B0050CQY1W|5.0|I don't think that I am as critical of music as others.  I like what I like and keep it moving.  I'm not into tearing apart, unless warrented.  With that being said, I can honestly say that I like this offering from Beyonce'.  Every dance track was just that...A DANCE TRACK, even the one that I didn't go for so much, RUN THE WORLD (GIRLS).  Still, I gave it a shot and it grew on me. Her mid-tempo and slow jams were on point and showed some versatility in her vocals.  My cd had 14 tracks on it instead of 12, so I got a little bit more from her.  I don't expect the universe, just enough sound to enjoy the ride, and she provided that, and I applauded her for it.
B007IK44CK|5.0|Great Adventure and action film.  Just get ready to be stressed for the entire movie!  Get's you ready for the next MI movie!
0152023984|5.0|I love this story and the layout of this book.  Thank you Amazon for the excellent price.  I wish I could acquire an additional four copies immediately if not at once.<br />This text is excellent as a reader for the advanced Italian student in conjunction with the Advanced Italian review grammar book.<br />My American students of Italian are relishing reading this book every week.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I'm sorry everyone was so upset about the abrupt ending of a story they thought would be resolved (thanks for the heads up, by the way) but this was a great book. To end it too soon would be a crime. Gideon and Eva's story is complex and moving. I, for one, am glad that Sylvia Day is taking time to really delve into their relationship(s) instead of glossing over the  hard ,getting to know each other work that needs to be done between two deeply damaged people. My only hope is the we don't have to wait too long for the next chapter of their story. I CAN'T WAIT!!! People should contain their reviews to the story,characters & plot. (Though again,I was Glad I knew ahead of time that there was more to come in other books!) ;-D
B00004TDTO|5.0|Great Plot, cast, and photography with peerless direction. A consummate nail-biter. Once you've seen it and  you go back to see it all over again, you still expect something to happen in the parts where you know nothing happens. A direction feat!
B00992CF6W|5.0|So I love minecraft but since the new update came out you cant just join games like you used to. That sucks because my sister and I made a world together and I can't save it now because all it says when you go to realms is no open server slots available. Overall its a pretty good game and I would reccomend!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this game. but the serpent one is like really hard I can never pass it. I will just have to get help
B004P8A7J2|4.0|This movie kept me in suspense the entire movie.  I wish not to give away the plot, but it is worth viewing.
1400069289|5.0|This book was both fascinating and a pleasure to read. I read it in one weekend, and have recommended it to many people. It has helped me rethink my OCD disorder and given me some new ideas on how, why, and what I can do about it. But even for people without a 'habit' that they want to break, just the bigger themes of science, society, sport and marketing were fascinating.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|keeps you. and easy to play. would be better if longer. vidoe grafics are Good. cant wait to play sequel.<br />do t think its worth 2.99 though.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|Nice story and great acting by all...ending was done right as well..watch it if you can, but listen to every word...
B004HW7JMO|5.0|... her portraying and depiction perfectly resembles the always present MALICIOUSNESS since the very ancient times .... including the always very CIVILIZED roman empire people .... very significant to understand human psych ... the overall dialogues are a very nice way to approach the language romans might employ in thosedays ... is worth listening to all the carefully chosen dialogues .... plus she is such a beautiful english actress as the rest of both male & female cast ...
B000GL1BHO|5.0|This is exactly what we wanted to add to my 4 year old's dinosaur collection - he loved this and has carried it around everywhere to show it to people! Great detail and it's small, but just like the other dinosaur toys we have, and perfect size for a preschooler, so perfect!
B005HSL626|5.0|yo it was chill nothing like the backstreet boys or jemmy hendricks. it made me happy but my eyes be like not moving...
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Compelling series.  Very entertaining and interesting subject matter. Just started the series from the very beginning so far the characters and acting are really well played.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|IT'S JUST EPICLY AWESOME OF AWESOMENESS<br /><br />I CAN'T go on without the game to AWESOMENESS  I am recommending this game to everyone
0679805273|5.0|I bought this book for my granddaughter.  I plan to have her teachers sign it each year through graduation for a keepsake.  She loves reading, and what a perfect way to remember your school days than have notes from your teachers.  I ordered this book yesterday and was surprised it arrived today one day ahead of schedule.
B005K2YRVG|4.0|A nice, well constructed sleeve to protect my Kindle Paper.  Easy to use and fits in a purse which makes it easier to carry around.
0812983459|4.0|My mother and I chose this for our small book club and had some great discussions around it involving the characters.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I have been playing this for a while it really fun and relaxing. My app on my kindle keep glitching for closing and what not so I had to uninstall and start over. O well here I go again from the beginning.  Fun free and interacting with others its great!!!!
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|This movie was very suspensful, it had a great deal of twists and turns through out the entire film. After being out of the the filming industry as long Arnold Schwartzenegger was I was definitely suprised at how much I liked this film. After watching this movie I would love a chance to drive that vet it was Beautiful! Peter Stomare (Cartel Head Enforcer)was excellent in his preformance as well this part fit him like a glove, and Johnny Knoxville was hilarious as always!!
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|this is i very interesting series,  i am watching the second episode now, i am hooked.<br />the characters  are well choosed, very cool special effect .well written story.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I LOVED THE FIRST TWO BOOKS.  ENTWINED WAS A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT. I've read the first two several times & my books are falling apart from passing them around to friends. I'll pass this one on as well, but I don't have the excitement or enthusiasm with this novel at all.<br /><br />The connection to the characters was missing. The love & passion was overshadowed by their lust. I skimmed the sex scenes, not feeling the heart that prevailed in the first two novels.<br /><br />Basically, this was very simply a &#34;filler&#34; book. Entwined introduced a few new players that will undoubtedly be important in the following novels. I will definitely read the rest of their story, hoping that SD brings back the intimacy of the characters.<br /><br />I HATE GIVING THE ONE STAR RATING, but I could have read a blog & received all I needed to know to continue Gideon and Eva's story.<br /><br />I love Sylvia Day as an author and highly recommend her other books. I'm hoping that the heart and soul return in the next two books. Beyond disappointed and leery of what lies ahead.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|Fortunately for me, I read his 3rd book first, a paperback that a friend gave me while onmvacation along with a strong recommendation.  I really liked it, so went back to his first book to &#34;catch up&#34; on the series.<br /><br />After the first several chapters I almost put it down.  Paragraph after paragraph of short, choppy sentences.  Like it was written for an eighth-grader (or younger).  Like machine gun fire.  I hated it!  Then, it suddenly evolved...better writing and a good, complex, story line.<br /><br />Granted, Reacher many times appears omnipotent in his ability to take tiny bits of convoluted, seemingly unrelated and unimportant information and figue out EXACTLY what is going on.  But if you enjoy &#34;the good guys always win&#34; with a minimum of (usually irrelevant and unnecessary) foul language and graphic descriptions, I heartily recommend his other books. You could skip #1 with no loss of background.<br /><br />I just finished #5 and immediately downloaded the next!
B0060ANOXY|4.0|I love Roger's music and this is a great cd except I don't care for his liberal politics and they often make their way into his lyrics. Often he is saying things in his lyrics that are tongue in cheek and sarcastic while trying to make a broader point through irony and analogies. However sometimes he just seems anti-American and anti-conservative ( The latter of which I KNOW he is). Maybe I am dense but sometimes I can't tell which is which i.e. is he being ironic or does he dislike America? With that being said, this is a really good record. But  here is a message to artists like roger : &#34;Please keep YOUR politics out of OUR music&#34;. After all it is OUR music isn't it? I still love Roger Waters though!
075669812X|5.0|My son loves Lego and these books are great. They have so much information, he is entertained for hours.<br />Highly recommended for any child who is into Lego.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I did enjoy the book. I would give it a higher rating if it had not ended the way it does, leaving you wanting more. So definitely have to read the other books to understand Grey's psyche. Also I thought this book would show more shades of Grey and would actually be darker. From reading other reviews I thought this 1st book was a lot more shocking.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|I didn't watch Breaking Bad until a couple months ago.  A friend raved about it so I ordered Season 1.  Immediately, I was hooked.  I've now completed Season 4 and can't wait to watch Season 5.  Bryan Cranston is amazing as Walt.  The storyline is brilliant.  It keeps you rooting for Walt even though he does some terrible things.
B006LSZECO|3.0|It was so well written. The storyline could not be predicted and twists were great; but in the end it left me flat.
B009ZUZ9FW|5.0|There are a great many books on programming and the C variants in general.  The giant books, which are supposed to teach you everything, actually don't do a good job at anything.  I first bought the original text of this book (1st edition) in 1985.  I bought the paper version of the 2nd edition shortly after it was released.  Just recently I bought the digital version of the 2nd edition to keep it accessible.  My paper version finally is ready for the recycling skip.<br /><br />Anyone that programs modern systems and/or in mobile environments will benefit from this text.  Someone just trying to learn will find it indispensable because it grounds you in the fundamentals.

B008BU75IQ|5.0|loved the trilogy -- VERY-- disappointed the third book left me expecting a conclusion - none (and what  an ending it was) never expected there will be 2 more books. Mr Archer, when can we expect them ?

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Funny how people who liked and enjoyed the book think people who don't are hateful and negative.<br />We all bought the book and that gives us a right to have our opinions.<br />I personally DIDN'T LIKE THE BOOK! I liked and still like Sylvia Day, but by chapter 3 I was wondering if someone else wrote Entwined With You.<br />If you liked this third book in the crossfire series fine, for those of us who BOUGHT BUT DIDNT ENJOY IT, allow us voice our opinions.<br />Doesn't matter how negative a feedback might be, it wouldn't stop a good and serious writer from writing another book. Authors read, Listen, learn and are open to readers feedback & counsel.<br />Personally, I didn't enjoy EWY. The book ran in circles, nothing new was learnt, well apart from a sex tape and Cary might be having a baby. Even those were just starting another storyline for book 4 or maybe 5.<br />Eva didn't really stand up for herself, every time something happens between her and Gideon, they have sex.<br />All I'm saying is after the very long wait for this book, my mind wasn't blown at all. I even put it down to do other stuff cos i was so bored. Which didn't happen with the first two books.

B00CMEQD30|4.0|This was a good first book and I'm definitely looking forward to Hellenthal's future works. It took me a little while to get into the flow of the story. I think the editing could use some touching up, some typos and grammar that felt off distracted me. But after I got into the journey I did really like the heroines and Hellenthal's world became very interesting.<br /><br />I think her imagination is wonderful and she created some truly beautiful images. She allowed things to grow and didn't rush things that needed space. The connection between the women was believably strong by the end and they were sweet and caring. This book surprised me on more than one occasion, taking turns I didn't see coming and I really enjoy that in a book.<br /><br />So I think Hellenthal has a lot of promise and a great imagination. I definitely think she'll get better and better. This one as I said could have used some editing here and there and some sections could have been tightened up. But all that is stuff that will improve with time. If you're a fan of lesbian fantasy and romance you could enjoy this.

B00BTHWFBK|4.0|When this album was announced on 11/11/11, I was cautiously optimistic.  Could the original Black Sabbath lineup still make a good, much less great album after all these years?  Then Bill Ward backed out, and Tony Iommi got cancer.  Yet, somehow, the band persevered with impressive results.<br /><br />Sabbath isn't trying to reinvent the wheel here.  13 doesn't really stray from the traditional Sabbath sound.  There are plenty of times when this album...let's be nice and say \\"pays homage\\" to classic Sabbath songs.  And I'm not talking in general; I mean specific songs.  \\"End of the Beginning\\" alone has parts that remind me of the songs \\"Black Sabbath\\", \\"You Won't Change Me\\", and \\"Dirty Women\\", and \\"Zeitgeist\\" is obviously a direct follow-up of \\"Planet Caravan\\", both thematically and musically.<br /><br />Nevertheless, just as he did with Metallica, Rick Rubin has helped the band craft an album that feels modern and relevant while still sounding like classic Black Sabbath.  Granted, Ozzy's voice isn't what it used to be, and it's not truly the \\"Original\\" Black Sabbath without Bill Ward (though I have to admit, I think Brad Wilk does an admirable job here).  But considering the obstacles the band had to deal with, it's pretty remarkable that the album turned out so well.  If this turns out to be the last Black Sabbath album we ever get, at least they're going out with a winner.<br /><br />Also, in case you're wondering, the bonus tracks in the Deluxe Edition are worth having, though I don't see why they weren't simply included on the main album which, even with the bonus tracks, only clocks in at a little over an hour.  There are apparently still four more tracks that the band recorded that aren't on any version of the album.  Hopefully, these will be released somewhere down the line, perhaps as an E.P.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I am not happy with the Facebook app in the silk browser. It looks cheesy. This app really needs work to allow users to have the full look and feel and functionality of Facebook. Recently told a friend she'd be happier replacing her stolen ipad with another iPad and not a Kindle. She uses it for work and therefore needs access to the best performing applications. Kindle needs to step up the performance of app developers if they really want to compete with other devices.
B004289ZW0|2.0|The GPS fu nctions well through plexiglass aircraft windows.  It has a difficult time getting position information through the thicker glass windows of a Challenger.  It works sometimes if you get your satellite position before you taxi, but just as often it will lose position in flight.  The other problem is turning the unit off, you swipe your finger across the device to turn on and off.  I've swiped it 20 times and it won't turn off, just have to let the battery run down and recharge it before each flight, what a pain!

B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Really???  Such a disappointment.  After spending $10 per book now I'm supposed to get sucked in to spending more?  I'll stick with 50 Shades.  I had to re-read first two books to remember the whole story by the time the 3rd (Entwined) came out and expected closure.  Come on.  Just OK.  Don't know if I'll subject myself to more misery in two more books.  Too much replay of first two books which we should all know (or re-read).  Should have given 1 or 2 stars but I still made it the entire way through this book so it deserved 3.
B00932A4XE|3.0|This movie was funny and entertaining but not as funny as the ads make it seem. Glad I didn't make my husband watch it
B00BK5D95C|4.0|The album reminded me of Imagine Dragons, AWOL Nation, and Gotye, in that the album as a while is markedly different than one would expect from the singles. Not bad, just different. Rather like radiohead meeting the avett brothers

B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I seriously don't know what everyone is complaining about regarding the \\"trilogy\\" reference.  I can't find anything that points to Sylvia Day calling the Crossfire series a \\"trilogy\\".  Her website FAQ states the series will be a quintet:  http://www.sylviaday.com/faq/<br /><br />It's always been called the Crossfire SERIES.  Not the Crossfire \\"Trilogy\\".  I believe people are making assumptions as 50 Shades of Grey was a Trilogy and not even worth comparison to Ms. Day's amazing writing, storyline and experience.  She has said numerous times in numerous interviews that when she began the Crossfire SERIES she did not know how many books there would be.  In fact, originally she thought it would be only TWO in the beginning.  Do your homework on the conception of the series from Ms.Day.<br /><br />Ease up people....really.  If she wrote 50 books on Crossfire, I'd read them all.

B00BTHWFBK|5.0|How many bands have a legacy as important as the one Black Sabbath has built? The band started a musical revolution and has influenced more bands than anyone, excluding maybe The Beatles.  Can a new record live up to a catalog of records that for the last 43 years has been the blueprint for all heavier music? Their new release 13 is their first record with vocalist Ozzy Osbourne in 35 years.<br /><br />Sessions originally started thirteen years ago but soon fizzled out, as the material didn't live up to the bands expectations. Holding a press conference on 11-11-11 they announced to the world that they had been writing and were going to give it one more try to capture a record they felt was worthy of the Sabbath name. That's when the wheels began to fall off.<br /><br />Original drummer Bill Ward had a very public battle with the band and withdrew himself from the recording process. Depending on whose side you believe, it was either financially motivated or Ward wasn't up to the task on playing the drums any longer. Then guitarist Tony Iommi was diagnosed with early stages of lymphoma and has been treating it with chemotherapy, which he will have to endure for the rest of his life. Osbourne also drug relapsed and was separated from his wife Sharon.<br /><br />Longtime Sabbath fan and producer extraordinaire Rick Rubin was brought in to work with the band for their reunion album. His goal was for Sabbath to go back to the sound of their earliest days. He sat Sabbath down and played them their debut record Black Sabbath.  He wanted to instill in them the sound and style that was initially captured and bring back the jazz and blues influences that dominated their early sound.<br /><br />Rubin also recommended Audioslave and Rage Against the Machine drummer Brad Wilk as Ward's replacement for the sessions. Although initially an odd pairing, Wilk's sense of style and swing was the perfect choice.<br /><br />13 opens with the bone crushingly heavy \\"End of the Beginning.\\"Instantaneously we are brought back to their debut as a plodding guitar line accompanies a vulnerable Ozzy who asks, \\"Is this the end of the beginning or the beginning of the end?\\" What a prophetic line for a band that is trying to find their way 43 years after they began. This is an epic track and one that only Sabbath can produce, not containing a chorus and based around five different movements that never repeat. Once the speed picks up this song is an all time classic.<br /><br />The acoustic based \\"Zeitgeist\\" is a throwback to the stylings of \\"Planet Caravan\\" and \\"Solitude.\\" A gorgeous acoustic guitar and bongo's mesh beautifully with an elegant over effected vocal from Ozzy. We are taken on another trip through space with deep lyrics about black holes, string theory and nuclear fission that only Geezer Butler can pen. A perfect interlude on a record that is mostly heavy and crushing.<br /><br />The record ends strong with the blues and jam inspired \\"Damaged Soul\\" and \\"Dear Father.\\" The former track is a throwback to their roots and was written and recorded live on the spot. The rawness serves the song as Iommi's solos are so stunning one feels like they are in the room while he is playing. How many bands could ever imagine coming up with something so stunning while jamming?<br /><br />\\"Dear Father\\" accompanies the best chorus on the record and the most disturbing lyric. Dealing with the topic of a pedophile priest who now has to deal with the consequences as one of his victims has come back to murder him. Another ambitious track that is impressive in scope.<br /><br />The extended version comes with three bonus tracks (another track is included as a Best Buy exclusive) and they are equally as impressive. The crystal meth inspired \\"Methademic\\" is the best of the bunch as it is up-tempo and goes for the throat with one of the best riffs on the record. The now out of print box set comes with a bonus DVD, photographs, a vinyl pressing and hand written lyrics. An impressive and classy looking set.<br /><br />Five of the eight tracks clock in over the seven-minute mark but in classic Sabbath style the songs never lose their interest, as there are enough changes to keep the listener engaged. 13 is a throwback to the vibe of their first three albums and there are nods and hints at past work but nothing is retread. If we can let Slayer and AC/DC slide on repeating themselves, I think we can accept the band that started it all to dip into their glorious past.<br /><br />13 is a brilliant return to form and finds Sabbath more cohesive than ever. The combination of Iommi's riffs, Geezer's lyrics and Ozzy's one of a kind voice and melodies is astounding. Ozzy might not have the range he once had but his voice is captured perfectly by Rubin as its emotional, compelling and the best he has sounded since his 1995 solo record Ozzmosis. No Auto-Tune or over processed vocals that Ozzy has been relying on for his past few solo records is to be found.<br /><br />This is not only the most anticipated album of the year but of the last 35. If one isn't a fan of this record I just can't see them ever being a fan of the original eight records. If this is indeed the end of the beginning then 13 is the perfect exclamation point on a career that is untouchable.<br /><br />As a longtime fan I can't begin to describe the emotion I have had listening to and discovering their new record. Iommi, Butler and Osbourne have been a permanent fixture in my life and 13 feels like old friends coming back home and reminding us all that music is played from ones heart and soul; something that is missing from most of modern day music.<br /><br />-originally published at About.com Heavy Metal

B002MQYOFW|5.0|At first, I was apprehensive reading a \\"futuristic\\" story. Am I glad I did. I found myself involved in the lives of Katniss, her family and friends, as well as her co-competitors in the games. The concept of fighting until there is only one survivor could be seen as callous, but the way Suzanne Collins tells her story, makes it readable. This is a book I would definitely read again!
B002VPE1AW|5.0|Anyone not like this movie? Anyone not seen this movie. It is a must see. When will the part 2 be coming out. Im waiting.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I am so disappointed with this book....feels like I waited forever for NOTHING. The book was more of the same, definitely not as good as the first two. I absolutely loved the first two and couldn't wait to read this one. It took me forever to finish it when normally it would have been read in one day, even if I had to skip sleeping! At this point the characters have even lost appeal to me, which is so sad because I fell in love with Gideon in the first book. Then to be left hanging AGAIN and expected to pay $9.99 each for two more books  to get to an ending....NO THANK YOU.

It is a story that will be with me for a long time, the same with the characters. Brilliant. If you're on the edge about whether or not to get this book, just do it. So worth it.

B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I thought the storyline was a little slow until about half way through.  The whole Angel/ace nicknames were used a little too much for my taste.  Gideon needs to lighten up a little more and Gideon and Eva's relationship needs to even out a little.  I'm not comfortable with them right now.  As far as the ending, I didn't see it coming... well done hidden ending leaving you wanting more.  All in all, the pace of the book was too scattered and it left the main storyline a little weak.  Nevertheless, I will be the first in line for the next/last book.

B00AXVIHBU|5.0|The following review is written after viewing Downton Abbey, the original UK version, downloaded and viewed through Amazon's digital broadcast medium.<br /><br />I have a very slow Internet connection, but I was able to adequately view Downton Abbey using my Mac computer. The picture and sound quality was decent.<br /><br />What I love most about Downton Abbey is the well-written characters, characters who are so well-written that none are perfect, but I've learned to love them all for they are so human in their imperfectness.<br /><br />The third season of this show has been often the most heartbreaking as one of the daughters dies from eclampsia. Through it all the Crawleys and their servants muddle through Downton Abbey's many problems.<br /><br />Historically the backdrops and settings are rich in detail. You will feel like you've gone back to the 1920s as you watch this well-acted and well-researched television show.<br /><br />Highly recommend.<br /><br />Penmouse

B00007GZQZ|1.0|This was on a list of great movies about money I've been reviewing.  It is not funny and the house problems are greatly exaggerated.  I had to turn it off within the 1st hour.  I agree with another reviewer that most 80's comedies are bad.  Most 80's movies in general are bad.  I still don't get all the hype over Wall Street.  I was not a fan of 80's movies then and can appreciate very few now.  (Though I am a BIG 80's music fan. Go figure.) I guess I'm only a sucker for the John Hughes 80's films.  Other than that...no.  Money Pit is a definite NO.

B00AFROVQC|4.0|I occasionally browse through the free books on Amazon not expecting too much and then sometimes there is a diamond in the rough. It is true that Morgan Rice writes for young adults, the language, characters and plot is geared to that audience nevertheless I have to admit that once I (I have three kids the oldest is 11) finished reading I immediately bought the next book in the series. I am looking forward to book 6 wondering where the author will go with the characters she developed. I recommended the books to my 11 year old but as with kids that age most likely when Dad recommends something they will not even try :).
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I was SO looking forward to the third book in the supposed trilogy that I went back and read books one and two in anticipation. When three came out I realized that so much of the book was devoted to describing things we already knew.... same old stuff, different day. I felt whole pages were filled with material I'd read previously. I liked books one and two, but three just seemed like so much filler.<br />And what's with all the side stories? I don't give a hoot about all the extra characters like a cousin that Eva hasn't seen in years, Megumi, Corrine and her marital problems, the new guy in the office and his weird diet, etc. I'm glad the murder was all cleared up nice and neat and I would have left it at that. I'm glad Eva and Gideon are married now and moving Cary into the connected appartment. As far as I'm concerned, this story is over and done. Gideon's happy so I got my HEA.  I don't want to read about Eva and Cary going to CA as it will more than likely make me even more upset with her than I am already. As far as the author is concerned, I think she's a greedy b***h for dragging this on, and she will never see another dime from me. There are a lot of good stories out there, and I can find better authors that aren't so greedy.

As far as I know, I've now read all of Olson's books on the subject and found each to be fascinating in its own way.  (They led me to two or three other books by different authors on related subjects.)  I think I know just about all one needs to know on this period--especially as we are aware how it all came out in the end.  &#34;Those Angry Days&#34; is probably the most political of the five books --and they are all political- (The Murrow Boys, Troublesome Young Men, A Question of Honor, Citizens of London, Those Angry Days)and quite likely the best written.  Reader, needs to be prepared, however, for the obvious evidence that Olson doesn't think much of Franklin Roosevelt.  Whether she began with this outlook, or developed it over the period of her research, is unknown.  Actually a personal memoir, describing her own development as popular historian of the period would be a fine conclusion to the series.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|I had this album for at least 4 yrs and somehow it broke I was lost without it so bought another to replace the original.  Love to sing along.
B00CW665VI|4.0|At first glance, this book is a train wreck. You know you shouldn't keep reading after the first chapter, but for some perverse reason, you can't look away. Before you know it, Drew Evans has convinced you it's not a wreck at all, but a party and you're laughing out loud at his ridiculously hilarious male views. If you are the type of reader that holds your fictional characters to real world moral standards, you should pass. For those who enjoy a little off-color humor, try it out for the entertainment value. I did and I'm still laughing.
0765338149|5.0|Perfect condition, hardcover, good color, good book, best price. I think this cover is different than the usual cover it has because of the movie.
0646497855|5.0|I love this study material. It help me a lot to pass my IELTS. It gives a lot of technique of how to construct your topic. Highly recommended.
0345529057|5.0|perfect condition books, books 1-4 come in a holder that can hold all 4 books in place as it shows in the picture. Great price for anyone who wants to read the books. great gift also.
B00CQGU9GG|2.0|I was looking forward to this set and I was hoping that the people behind the product would do it right this time. Unfortunately these CDs were recorded very loud and have a brickwalled waveform when examined with audio editing software. Since they can't get it right I guess the last option is to get the original vinyl and do it myself. This is the last time I will purchase these albums on CD.<br /><br />If you are not familiar with what brickwalling is just do a websearch for \\"loudness war.\\"<br /><br />So for an audiophile this is not the right choice, but for the casual fan looking to play on an iPod these might suffice.<br /><br />Based on mastering alone this would be a one star review, but if you don't already have these CDs you get 10 CDs with 100 songs for forty bucks which is at least a bargain price.<br /><br />For those of us who have purchased these on CD multiple times this is a big disappointment.

1432794426|5.0|During the past four years, I have researched Michael Jackson's creative and humanitarian life.  I am constantly in search of books and materials that PAY MICHAEL FORWARD...Dr. Moriarty's book does just that.  She has taken time to research well and tell Michael's truth.  She has also included Michael's own words and the words of those who knew and worked with him.  As a Fan, I am delighted with this work because truthful accounts of Michael and who he was, his character, his efforts to try to heal the world, his musical genius...all are important not only to Fans but to the public in general.  Michael's legacy is important and will not be told by media sources.  Dr. Moriarty is respectful and mindful of that.  Those of us whose hearts have been touched by Michael Jackson and who care about his life and legacy need to include DEFENDING A KING in their Michael Jackson collection.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Very nice and highly addictive game. Props to t h e devs for this great for this great time waster
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Good easy read. Reacher is a throw back no BS character that cant exist today but would be great to see . Lee Childs is a great writer in a style some what like James Patterson, John Grisham or John Sanford  . I will read the entire series.
B000063TS9|5.0|This well recorded disc, made in 2001, brings together an enjoyable a selection of Shostakovich in a light vein. This is based on his stage works, the main item of which is the music he wrote for his ballet, The Bolt. That concerned industrial espionage and a rather doubtful plot. It is now available on a recent Blu-ray but it is arguable that this selection of music drawn from it as a suite provides the more enduring and enjoyable option. Shostakovich apparently thought so too which is why he produced the suite which proved to be a popular decision.<br /><br />The concluding Tahiti Trot is actually Shostakovich's arrangement of tea for Two, written is response to a challenge to provide an arrangement in an hour. He actually completed the job in 40 minutes and it has proved popular ever since.<br /><br />The two Jazz Suites are collections of light stage dances more associated with ballroom dance titles rather than American styled jazz. Those expecting the latter may be disappointed therefore but everyone else is likely to thoroughly enjoy this stream of good quality light music.<br /><br />All the pieces are played with enthusiasm and with style by these Russian musicians.<br /><br />I would suggest that the disc provides considerable delight and illustrates an important alternative side to Shostakovich that ought to be known about more widely. As such the disc deserves serious consideration as a purchase option. There seems little reason to pay more as this disc offers evidence that quality is not always to do with paying top prices.
B009MYARIK|5.0|Really liked this book, as I have all kinsella's books.  It was warm and lighthearted - an easy read, perfect  beach read for your next vacay.

B002ZG99TA|4.0|Not to be confused with Unstoppable (2004), which starred Wesley Snipes, with a completely different screenplay having nothing to do with trains.<br />Of course,  Denzel Washington is just fine as the Old Vet who has 30 days to go before he goes on forced retirement with half the expected pension. Chris Pine, whom I do not know, handles well what is required of the rookie working with  Washington.  Assorted other players are quite competent in support. A simple story, many times filmed. Runaway train with a lethal cargo. Washington and Pine, on another train,  are the last resort if a violent explosion of a highly combustible cargo in a populated area, is to be avoided. With the exception of some minor personal problems each faces, the plot and the Director have chosen to go straight down the line with nothing going on but the runaway train, the train on which Washington and Pine are, and the axis including local and higher administrative decision-makers. For very good reasons, since The Great Train Robbery,  railroads have been the setting for many fine and not-at-all fine films; there is that notion of speed, isolation from the surrounding countryside, and being in a world of its own, that puts us in the mood for romance, adventure and thrills. While the first is absent here (save for off-the-train brief shots ) the other two are present in spades.<br />A good picture for the family, there are only one or two mild expletives which might disturb even the most fastidious parents, I can recommend this to any potential viewer regardless of what their favorite genre is.
B004FV1ESW|4.0|Having never seen the original movie, I couldn't tell where the extended scenes were. That shows me how well this film was edited for one thing. Ben Affleck has proven, once again, he knows what he's doing behind the camera, as well as in front of the camera.<br /> I enjoyed the suspense, and the acting was far better than I expected. That's why I'm giving this movie a four out of five stars. Enjoyable with Affleck's  love interest too.<br /><br />R. E. Bliss
B009VSW15Y|3.0|I find it's better than having no camera app at all. The pictures are all right but not all that crisp.
6305511055|5.0|Even all these years later, this is a great movie and a timely one at that.  Robert Redford's character and his co-workers think that they read books.  But it's so much more.  Before he (Redford, nicknamed Condor) finds out what's really going on, he has met Faye Dunaway and dealt with all sorts of higher ups at the CIA.  I loved the movie when it came out and I love it still.  It's suspenseful, erotic, totally engrossing.
B00AFEY354|5.0|This was a great movie with a fantastic ending.  I don't want to give anything from the story away but I loved the ending!
B00AEFYCL4|5.0|The movie itself is wonderful.  The scenery and characters are beautifully photographed and the cast is great.  The performances are wonderful.  The music is chosen well.  So from a purely technical standpoint, the movie is awesome.      But I found the subject matter very unsettling. The main character, Chris/Alex, left warring impressions on me.  On the one hand, it's great to strike out and leave your comfort zone, hoping to find out about life and yourself.  On the other, it's quite another thing to just drop out of your family's life completely.  I found the boy - and he always was a boy, he never became a man - to be selfish and irresponsible.  Even my daughter, who normally is very counter-culture, was irritated by him, by his naivete and refusal to acknowledge that life isn't only about you, it's about how you deal with and treat others.     Near the end of the movie, it seemed as if Chris/Alex realized his \\"adventure\\" had turned into something else, something he wanted to leave.  By then, it was too late and random circumstances were too difficult to overcome.  I was enormously saddened by the movie's ending.      The main thing I like about the movie is how it can lead to conversation about what it means to honor others while finding yourself.  There's a line from another movie that I think applies here, too:  \\"You don't realize that you can hurt people.\\"  I'm not sure Chris/Alex lived long enough to realize this.  Based on what it seems he could have become, this is a tragedy.
B000FCK65W|5.0|I absolutely loved every minute spent reading this book. Francis is not a character I will forget. This is a must read!!!
B00AM0C6YG|3.0|Its not a bad first album, track 3 is very good and is already being used in adverts in Australia. Worth buying
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I thought this would be a last of a trilogy.  I will never prepURCHas a book again.  If I had known your intent, I would have never purchased book 3.  I loved the first two books and looked forward to the resolution in book 3.  Sylvia Day,  I'm not buying any more of your books.  I feel you really betrayed your readers by trying to drag the story out unnecessarily.<br /><br />Y0u've robbed me of a really good story. I'm very sorry of that.  Wish you could have done differently.

1781162646|5.0|This is not a usual King horror novel. Their are horror elements their are also whodunnit suspense romance and such all rolled up into one! A great book for anyone really! Buy it now! You'll like it!
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Ive been into Black Sabbath for about 25 years now and this album is all I could have hoped and dreamed for. Excellent & heavy as all hell! Sure Ozzy's voice doesnt have the same range it did 30-40 years ago and it sucks that Bill's not on the record however the music is simply put...amazing. All 12 cuts (best buy edition) are killer! The production is also incredible if youre a regular guy blasting it in a regular cd player I think you'll agree. 13 is THE album of the year, pick it up with no hesitation its worth every penny. Black Sabbath will.........live forever!
B00C4GRGQY|5.0|The author has a way with words that make the material easy to understand from the pro to the beginner. I have read all his books and although the other two are fantastic this one takes the cake. There is no better book you could buy to improve your portraiture more than this one. There's no bells or whistles, Neil just teaches us to understand photography which means light and how to utilize it. No recipes or settings but giving the knowledge to maximize our potential. And that's what photography is about.<br /><br />If you want to take great people portraits or similar this is the book but don't forget to consider the others as well. They are kind of like a series. Learned more from Neil than anywhere else.<br /><br />Kudos Neil.<br /><br />Can't wait for the next book.<br /><br />Hope you keep me coming but it's going to be tough to top this one.
B004VDSWQ6|5.0|If you've ever loved Sabbath with Dio then you MUST absolutely add this Blu-Ray to your collection as I have! Vinny's thunderous drumming is on point. Tony's guitar riffs are classic and timeless! Geezer's bass lines are roaring and pumping! And last but not at all least, the late Ronnie James Dio (R.I.P.) is still at the top of his game with his unique and amazing vocals! This is one of Dio's finest performances and showcases the band at their best! I was fortunate enough to have attended this performance and I must say this DVD certainly captures the magic of Heaven & Hell that night!! Excellent production and 5.1 sound will rock you out of your seat! Get this Blu-Ray and you will not be at all disappointed!! God Bless Dio and the amazing legacy he left behind!
B000JIN3J8|2.0|I didn't like the video due to it's poor quality. I was disappointed that you don't provide a better quality film for free with my Prime account. The option to view movies with the account is meaningless if I have to pay for the video, which I can get at Netflix for less. Upgrade the quality of video without charging!
B004JK61K0|5.0|This app works great on my Kindle Fire.  Has all the functions I wanted like multiple email Accts in one place; I can delete one email at a time,  multiples at once or entire lists.  It has all kinds of settings to make it look however you want it.

B00CL68QVQ|4.0|This was the second time we watch this show the girls really liked it it had a good ending Thanks
B00BLCHYKU|2.0|This movie was too violent and not suitable for families with children. The acting seemed good, but showed too much killing. I watched one episode and that was enough for me. I do not recommend this movie.
B00845MRKE|4.0|This is the greatest Sci-Fi Movie....ever. I have been a fan of this move since it was 1st released in the theater. And know it’s on Blu-ray!!<br /> So why 4 stars you ask? Its because of the packaging, The DVD box is 5-1/2” x 7”. The box it was shipped in is 7” x 10”. The shipping box had no packing material around the inner box so the DVD box can slide around during shipping. Mine did and it caused crushing to the upper left corner of the box. Fortunately the contents inside the DVD box were not harmed. It just would have been nice to get it looking brand new (like I purchased) and not looking used .<br /><br />Oh well….. &#34;All those moments will be lost in time... like tears in rain...&#34;
B005IQZB14|4.0|The author didn't hold anything back about her life and choices. She had a hard life with somethings being totally her own<br />fault.  The trip she took on the PCT was painful to read about and I would have quit hiking on the first day. I admired her perseverence but still think what she undertook was crazy to do alone.
193700788X|1.0|I'm the kind of reader who always peeks at the last page before committing to reading a novel. I know it's wrong to get spoiled about what's to come, I just can't help myself! I HAVE TO KNOW I will not hate it! With long series, it's even more important to trust the writer not to disappoint you. There's nothing more frustrating than getting into an unfinished series and then being deeply disappointed by the way it fizzles at the end. (George R.R. Martin, I'm looking at you! Six years' wait for the last book was pure torture, and wasn't even worth it... But I digress.)<br /><br />I've got into Sookie universe through True Blood on HBO. The show was fun, I loved the characters, and the TV series intrigued me enough to want to buy the books and read them. When I learned that Eric - the fantastic character from the show - was actually the main love interest of Sookie in the books, I was sold!<br /><br />So I went to Amazon to order the books...<br /><br />I was going to buy all Sookie books last year, but the lackluster reviews for the last couple of books gave me pause. It seemed the series were going downhill, and the longtime fans were unhappy with the quality and the content of the latest novels.<br /><br />So I've decided to wait a year for the last book before committing to buying the complete series.<br /><br />I'm so glad I didn't buy the series! I've read the reviews, I've read the spoilers, and there's NO WAY I'M EVER GOING TO SPEND A SINGLE DIME on any of these novels, or any books by Charlaine Harris.<br /><br />I have no patience for any author who doesn't respect the fans and who doesn't have the flexibility to let the story develop naturally and go where the story leads you. Charlaine Harris is officially on my blacklist, along with Joss Whedon (sorry, CH and JW fans).<br /><br />I know the drill. The author creates and we, the consumers, read or watch. What some authors seem to forget is that we, the consumers, are in it for the fun. We want to be entertained. Pain (a la Joss) or mundane boring disappointment (a la Harris), it just kills the franchise. If the last book is crap, why waste money on the series?<br /><br />I was a new prospective fan. I will not be wasting my time or money on any of these books. Sorry, Charlaine. I peeked at the end via spoilers... I found it stupid and disappointing. I'll pass.

B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Like many, I purchased the CD the day it was released (yesterday). I knew I was going to get the deluxe edition. I read that Best Buy offered an additional song on the bonus disc, \\"Naivete In Black\\". It's a fine song. Running 3:50. I doubt that anyone will say this Best But extra is the best song on the CD, but I wanted it, cause I want every song Sabbath. My general rule when listening to a new disc is to hold off on judgement until a couple of listens. Sometimes I get so amped up about the release, that every song sounds fantastic. Only upon subsequent listens I would realize it was good, just not great. This new release from Sabbath is truly a terrific listen. Ozzy's voice sounds amazing, Tony's guitar work is incredible, and Geezer's bass is outstanding. Sure, some of the tracks don't grab me. At least not yet. Like, \\"End Of The Beginning\\" and \\"Live Forever\\" Yet, these are certainly listenable. I really like the single \\"God Is Dead?\\", \\"Loner\\", and \\"Age Of Reason\\" to name just three. It is important to note: \\"13\\" is NOT \\"Paranoid\\". For me, \\"Paranoid\\" sits a top the Sabbath mountain of musical acheivement. Still, if you're a Sabbath fan, this collection should definitely be in your collection.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|I watched the DVD at home and had to buy the CD's  They didn't disappoint me.  Being a teen in the 60's I felt right at home listening to Sixto.  I'm glad he has at least felt the stardom he deserved a long time ago.
B000002KB8|5.0|Great music that brings back lots of great memories. Plug in your guitar and play along to a real classic.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|We love watching this show together in the evenings.  I like Law and Order, she likes drama, this is a nice balance of both.  More top actors seem to be coming on-board in season two.  We are looking forward to season 3.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I enjoyed this book. I liked getting a different perspective on teen love than the usual silly drama. I did feel that the language was much beyond any sixteen year old ive ever met using words and wit that i don't even posses at 31 but the author clearly has a much more intellectual mind then i. Other than that i would recommend this book to any gender or age. Its sad but realistic in most ways and makes you appreciate the small things in life.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|This has classic match 3 combined with goals and items you can use to assist. One of the best things is the ability to play on adventure mode to avoid the timer or you can play with one as well. Another great game from Big Fish!
B00008CMR6|5.0|How can you not love John Wayne. Enough comedy, action and just good old days of the cowboy to make anyone long to ride with the duke once again.
B000FC1RCI|5.0|I won't spoil it but this novel is the greatest work of mystery fiction every written by the greatest mystery writer of all time. It is a thrilling, intellectual masterpiece the likes of which are unmet.
B009UWYFFK|5.0|Shoot you just can't go wrong with a cast like this!  But what is mostly important is they &#34;THEY&#34; get it that it's a kid movie and family movie.  Lots of slap stick jokes and silliness to be enjoyed by everyone.  This is a movie you won't mind watching again and again.
0891419063|5.0|Excellent read.  Very true to life.  Was fortunate to have served with some of the &#34;Old Salts&#34; in the Corps.
B0058YPLA2|5.0|This show caught me on the first show.  Such interesting looks of well known story characters caught in a curse and sent to today's world (ours).  Good family show in my opinion and fun looks of the background of characters in a whole new light.
B00B1E6FF8|3.0|Wrong. This movie is wrong... not in its facts. But well... let me try to explain...<br /><br />The first 4/5s of it is the build up of finding the guy that linked the Americans to UBL (Usama (O!!!) Bin Laden. And then there was the whole night raid thing... and then it ended by having our main character crying her heart out and finally breaking down (for about 2 seconds) before the credits rolled. I think the ending did not justify the movie. The whole built up... at the very least they could have showed how he was buried at sea and maybe a foot note on how the data and the hunt was wrapped up....<br /><br />4/5 of the movie was about the hunt for UBL, but the ending was about the main character's closure from her trials and tribulations. There wasn't enough focus on that during the first 4/5s to justify such a stupid cheapskate lazy ass way to end the movie...<br /><br />Imagine Jurassic Park, its all about the dinosaurs getting out and romping around with the people caught in it, the people who started the whole story. Imagine if it ended immediately after Alan and gang escape the T-Rex in the final scenes with the velociraptor attacking it. And then it just cuts to credits... you'd be left wondering what the heck happened to all the characters right?<br /><br />Same problem with ZDT. WRONG ending for a movie.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|I feel Bale didn't really have his full heart into doing his last movie with the Cape and Cowl. Great catwoman and a few twists that make the movie enjoyable.
B004ZBFRTY|5.0|I've heard a lot about this movie, about how good it really is etc etc... but I've never watched it until now....<br /><br />At first... it just seems like a teen flick trying to do Scream, but then as the plot developed, and the different story arcs started emerging, it became more and more and MORE engaging. Really. I didn't not even pause for a toilet break.<br /><br />And then the end... WOW!! Not the big kind of Blockbuster movie wow... It was a really subtle sequence. But it resonated so loudly in my head... I honestly cannot remember any other movie that made me just sit there and contemplate everything that Donnie Darko had for me, the viewer, for so long. In such deep thought... Sad, happy are just words describing insufficient emotion to what I am really trying to say.<br /><br />I would compare it to American Beauty... Donnie Darko is better, more entertaining, MUCH more engaging than American Beauty. Even the romance part... it didn't need flashy nudity or what... but well, I'm a hopeless romantic, and I just loved the way that part of life was portrayed in Donnie Darko.<br /><br />If you haven't seen, go watch it. NOW. If you HAVE seen it, then I know you just want to watch it again but you just can't seem to get past contemplating the whole movie and so its just sitting on your shelf now while you cannot move on and get off your seat to the toilet. To those of you like that, tell you what, once I press the submit button on this review, I'm going to re watch this movie. And I'd love it if you were to join me by doing the same once you've read this.

B009PJXY3M|5.0|Not only is Bridgit Mendler's voice beautiful and soulful (watch out Adele) the lyrics are pure poetry. Not riddled with angst or sex?  I'm listening. Redolent of thoughtful and self-reflective growth? Really!  Tell me it's Radio Disney and I'm not sold right away, but I am getting my purse and saying a prayer while listening to the sample tracks.  Radio Disney has really been on its grind cranking out new hot talent that doesn't make parents quite as nauseated as the radio. Now,  if Disney  could only do something about its clothing lines. Listen to the sample tracks; you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />I can't be the only parent cringing at the songs on the radio.  I loved music as a kid and belted out some of the most popular tunes of the 1980's & '90's. Imagine my surprise and my own mother's (now Mimi) graying over my 7yr old's begging & beseeching for a certain blonde guitar-strumming Idol's latest album likely inspired by far too many relationships for her age.<br />My mom quietly asked what I thought and I could guess at her relief (in my parenting & her own non-stodginess with the bonus of the \\"I'm sorry but your mom & dad don't think it's a good thing for you to have\\") when I said I recommended that singer and her parents have a serious conversation, an in-depth gynecological exam and a celibacy belt.<br />For my daughter I purchased this album and asked my mom to download load it to Ry's tablet in parent mode. Instant family hit.<br /><br />We love:<br />city lights<br />hurricane<br />ready or not<br />hello my name is<br />All I see is gold<br />5:15
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|Finally, a large budget Hollywood film that artfully dives into reincarnation and karma.<br /><br />This was a well constructed movie that artfully weaved in profound philosophy.  The theme of karma and reincarnation is what ties the various stories together into a continuous tapestry.  I find it interesting that there are so many reviewers that do not seem to get this concept when it is actually stated in the dialogue of the various characters throughout the movie and other clues (such as the book on past lives that shows up every now and again).  That being said, this is a concept that is not necessarily embedded in Western thinking (although it certainly not a foreign concept).  As someone who is well versed in this concept, the movie immediately made sense to me.<br /><br />To those who did not 'get' this movie, I would encourage you to read a little bit on karma and reincarnation and hopefully this will make more sense.  You don't have to agree with the concept, but at least the movie and seemingly disconnected flow of characters/stories will make sense.<br /><br />Personally, I liked the seemingly disjointed flow of stories, but this was with the understanding that each character was in a different incarnation in future and past lives, and following that thread I could see the evolution (or in some cases de-evolution of character).  I have not read the book (yet), but in my opinion the concepts of reincarnation and karma were well represented.  I have truthfully been waiting for this movie, not because I knew about it, but one that would actually do the topic justice. While I just watched the movie, I know I will watch it again (and likely again).
B00BB22GQM|5.0|Great Album! Songwriting, production, everything is top notch. The creativity of this band is apparent throughout, but always in service of the song.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|After waiting for this book to be released, I am so disappointed.  Nothing is resolved and that is ridiculous after three books!!!
B0053KWDES|4.0|Great high a lows improvement, very use full when you have MP3 or other with low quality and you wants more power.
B009MO57H6|4.0|Not the best of the movies but better than some of them.  FX is good, still needs more solid story line.
B008ROELL0|4.0|Ever have one of those days where everything pisses you off? Like, LITERALLY everything? That's Mike Douglas in this movie. Also, Robert Duvall is there to let you know it's his last day as a cop...in almost every scene he's in. There are explosions and shoot-outs as well. Boo-ya.
B004SMDJ9U|4.0|I like everything about this show, but could be better with cast development.  It is just good science fiction.  Get it.
B00BFBSV72|4.0|Sonic and friends are jumping instead of running. Each character has a different style: jumping higher, falling slower, etc. Lots of power ups. Fun but slightly too challengng.
B007REV4T8|3.0|Not like the old James Bond films, but still pretty good.  Nothing really special about this film, FX is good.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love playing it.  Especially when you are playing winning hand.  Works well on kindle fire Hd 8.9.  Good game for free.  No glitches.
B000J2BRQU|3.0|I am a HUGE fan of the Fast & Furious movies but I had never seen this one because the characters were not the same as the other movies. My husband insisted we watch it and I have to say it was A LOT better than I expected.!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Leaves you wanting to start the next book IMMEDIATELY.  An excellent read for tweens and up. Looking forward to another series by Collins.
0312983867|5.0|Janet Evanovich really knows how to wind up a story, and how to build characters. I'm serious when I say I'm unable to put her books down
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Graphics are some of the best I have seen so far. Very smooth operating system. This rating is for campaign mode. I have yet to try multiplayer
1490313370|5.0|The Daily Practice works because it's nothing new or special. Unfortunately, most people are not going to try a damn thing in this book. They should, though. Too bad. :(
B00C061I3K|5.0|LOVE IT! THANK YOU DAFT PUNK FOR MAKING THIS AMAZING ALBUM! WE ALL LOVE YOU! PLEASE MAKE MORE MUSIC! THE WORLD NEED YOUR MUSIC!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|My daughters got me started with the series and I can't wait to see the movie.  Definitely need to read the first three books.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The first book I've kept on reading. I just love the characters. I love the emails. The conversations are great
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love Christian Gray. These books were so good, I wish I hadn't read them yet so I could go back and read them (again)! I may just do that anyway! As soon as I'm done with the Crossfire Series.
B003EYVXTG|4.0|This is not only a fabulous movie on many levels, but can also serve as a teaching tool. AP and IB psychology students in high school and college psych & sociology students can view this movie and then get invovled in conversations about the impact of meth lab cultures on families, law enforcement, and rural/urban society. Jennifer Lawrence's character is a strong young woman which, while not quite a Disney princess, can provide a role model of strength for her siblings. This is a movie about family, responsibility, rural culture, heartache, and tenacity of heart.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love Christian Gray. These books were so good, I wish I hadn't read them yet so I could go back and read them (again)! I may just do that anyway! As soon as I'm done with the Crossfire Series.
B002PEP4C8|3.0|The author's tremendous skill in descriptive writing makes the criminal attack unforgettable, just as the actual experience was for her.  And therein is the horror of the reality - it can't be forgotten, refuses to fade, is newly dreadful every day, every week, every year.  The memory is corrosive, acid-etching all of life, ruining all chance of happiness.  It is impossible to bear, for the author, and also for this reader.  The only experience I have had that carried this kind of weight was in watching Bergman's &#34;Cries and Whispers&#34;; the emotional response is overwhelming.<br /><br />I applaud the author's skill while warning prospective readers to consider their own capacity for vicarious suffering.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|You will absolutely not be disappointed with any book in this series. You will fall in love with Gideon just as you did with Christian Gray! :)
B004GYY714|1.0|I ordered this app several hours ago, and it still has not appeared on my Kindle Fire H D.  I realize it is a free app, but I am puzzled as to where it is. Is this app compatible with the Kindle Fire H D 7 inch?
B00846REIS|5.0|You will absolutely not be disappointed with any book in this series. You will fall in love with Gideon just as you did with Christian Gray! :)
1781162646|5.0|I don't think there's ever been a greater writer than King. Even the weakest of his more than 50 books are compelling page-turners with something serious to say about life and death. He's certainly the greatest chronicler of American working people (something that's usually not realized by people who haven't read him and consider his work trashy because he usually - though not always - writes in a genre). His epic scale, compassion and moral seriousness are equalled only (perhaps) by Melville. He is as funny as Twain, as sad and elegant as Fitzgerald, and he dwarfs Hemingway and Steinbeck.<br /><br />Joyland (a carny novel - what's not to love?) is one of his best, in the same league as Pet Sematary, Misery and Dolores Claiborne.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app. But then again, I love Pinterest (Who doesn't?!) It's got all the bells and whistles of using the online site, but on your phone! sometimes it's a bit slow and will &#34;close&#34; due to errors, but if I open it right back up it works just fine. Love pinterest!!
B00009V7PJ|3.0|The concert was nice but the DVD skipped in a few places. I had to fast forward through the parts and missed a couple chunks of the DVD
B008673ZAQ|5.0|You will absolutely not be disappointed with any book in this series. You will fall in love with Gideon just as you did with Christian Gray! :)
B00AG297GK|2.0|I like so-called stupid comedies but this was just a waste of time for me. I am glad it was free because I did not even watch the whole thing.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|If I could, I would play this game professionally. This app is awesome and I am so addicted to this game. I always have been!
B00C32R64G|3.0|The musicianship is solid and the production is good, but the overall songwriting is...lacking. There are some standout tracks,  but over half of this thing sounds like material that hit the cutting room floor on the last album, which was a beast. Beyond Hell/Above Heaven is near perfect and is a solid listen front to back. I found myself skipping a lot of the songs halfway through here. It's very workaday and nowhere near as interesting as previous albums. Disappointing, because they were a relatively recent favorite for me. This one is dull and forgettable.
B005ETANC2|5.0|DVD was crystal clear and sound was perfect. I hadn't seen  it in years and it brought back childhood memories of seeing it in movie theater. Highly recommend to all sci fi fans. Well done special effects. Most enjoyable. In the same class as THEM!
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|I have been wanting to read a Jack Reacher novel for quite a while so I finally decided to dive into one.  The first thing I noticed is how much of a miscast Tom Cruise was in the recent movie that came out.  Reacher is supposed to be a huge guy that has a quiet but deadly personality and can intimidate someone by looking at them.  That is not little Tom Cruise, Cruise couldn't intimidate my six year old. That being said, there was a lot to like but several things to dislike about this novel.<br /><br />In my humble opinion the strength of this novel is not the Jack Reacher character but it is the story and the supporting characters.  I really enjoyed the story about a drifter that comes into a corrupt small town of Margrave, GA and immediately gets into trouble.  That mixed with some really strong supporting characters creates a really solid story.  Jack Reacher was in the wrong place at the wrong time as a murder takes place and he is quickly identified and taking into custody.  Things get personal for Reacher and not only must he clear his name but he must solve this murder for his own piece of mind.<br /><br />A couple of things that I didn't like about the story were first certain aspects of the Jack Reacher character himself.  It is hard to imagine that the Reacher character is so much smarter than all the other law enforcement characters in the novel.  Not only that but since the story is told in a first person it almost sounds like embellishment from the narrator and make some of the dialog and some of the action unbelievable.  The other major aspect that I didn't like was about somewhere between a quarter and a third of the novel there is a giant coincident that is introduced to the storyline (I won't ruin it but you will know it when you read it) and I have a hard time getting past that.<br /><br />Overall, this was pretty good novel with some great characters and solid story but some certain issues that were hard to overcome.  I will say that the positives of this novel did convince me to check out another Reacher novel in the future.<br /><br />Grade: B-
B007SGM084|4.0|If you are offended by the idea of S&M this is not the book for you.  It is a good story with the general concept being one most of us have probably imagined --- falling in love with an attractive, super wealthy man.  It was a fun read.
B008ODZEQ0|4.0|Technique, ingredients, and timing apparently make Jiro's $300 serving of sushi better than some slap dash $200 serving down the street.  I wish there had been some kind of blindfold test with a close competitor.  There is an element of hero worship and myth making going on.  It seems every minute of his waking life has been devoted to being the best chef.  Was it always worth it?  Does he ever regret not developing other interests?  Does the fame and income mean much at 85?
B00821OX98|5.0|it was entertaining End to End. I enjoyed the show very much. Good Sci-fi TV. I can't wait for season 3
B008XKSW7M|5.0|This movie had me laughing and then crying and then laughing again. It was a roller coaster and while I can't compare it to the book since I haven't read it, if the book is even half as good you should read that too. :)
0805053883|5.0|I themed my shower gift as polar bear so I added this book because all kids will be read books and will learn to read them on their own too :)
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|As many people's reviews state, the game is great. It reminds me of a puzzle cube from a game called lighthouse I played 10+ years ago. I love these kinds of games/puzzles I wish more people would make them. It would be really cool if someone would come up with a deluxe puzzle box like this that would take days instead of hours to solve. Now I'm not talking harder.. just more. Have it start the size of a house and end up the size of a ring box. That would be a puzzle box and a half. Great job on this one though. Just needs to be about 10 chapters longer. Worth the $2 though.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|It's a great game but  it takes to long for coins . You need to git it . It's fun still. I wish it was real.
B00CHIY5OK|5.0|Amazing album in which you can hear influences from artists like Burial and includes awesome guess appearances such as Jessie Ware.<br /><br />The band is comprised of two brothers which isn't new but this is a debut from a twenty-one and an 18 year old.  Can't wait to see what the future holds for these kids
B008JFUP0I|5.0|I loved the original, liked 2nd (missing Dom but introduced Roman, so okay), 3rd was okay but I didn't care for it that much. I never saw 4 until 5 came out on DVD. My son saw it and said it was getting more like the 2 originals. I watched them  and got back into the series again. Fast 5 was the best one so far until this came out. I saw this one in the theater and OMG!! It was so good I limited my beverage intake so I wouldn't have to get up and go to the restroom. Now I can't wait until 7 comes out next summer.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This book is amazing! The ending.....oh the ending. I can't wait to see how it pans out for everyone in the end
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is so good. It can be a bit gross at times, but I suppose you get used to it, and because it is so unreal, it doesn't bother me so much. But the story line is so good, and you start to care for the characters, and want them to do well. You never know what to expect next with this show!
B00A81NFAS|5.0|This is an extremely entertaining movie. A couple of people with serious psychological issues find their way to romance through a dance competition. Other movies have used dance competitions as a vehicle for characters to find romance, but this movie is really special. With this movie, the viewer, like the two leading characters, must persevere to get to the happy ending.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|This book was really good. I wanted it watch it before the movie and im SO glad I did! The book (Like all books) goes into greater detail and gets you into the mind of the characters. I actually didn't really care for the move and would def recommend to skip the movie and read the book!
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|What can one say about an addiction to a British saga? This is a soap opera of huge proportions with a British accent. It has a great cast, engaging storylines, wonderful sets, and a great historical period as its backdrop.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|An amazing story. Out of all the chaos of the horrors of war a truly compassionate story.  Well told and all the more enjoyable because it was true. Terms
B002T3A4KW|5.0|This is a classic romantic comedy. The writing is wonderful, and the quirky supporting characters provide great background stories. Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts are at their peaks in this entertaining version of &#34;boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back, boy loses girl, and boy gets girl back again.&#34;
0345525558|5.0|A coworker recommended this book to me, and I bought it a week before my birthday as a birthday present to myself. It definitely suited that purpose, because I loved it.<br /><br />Diffenbaugh interweaves Victoria's back story, from when she young and living with Elizabeth, with her current life at 18 years old. While every other chapter jumped back and forth, the story always advanced, and you learned to care for the characters and keep hoping even while the characters couldn't experience that hope themselves. While I don't completely relate to Victoria, as I'm a lot more trusting of people, I think everyone can relate to her feeling unworthy at times, feeling like you're not good enough for something. She had basically been confronted with that and told that her whole life, and that would be a difficult to overcome.<br /><br />I also love the flower definition dictionary at the back of the book. All in all, this is an amazing book, and I would encourage mature young adults and older to read it.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Wow, what a downer.  Not one sympathetic character and she kills off the only person you are rooting for.  Very sad and depressing
B0029ZA3H4|1.0|How did this book get such rave reviews early but such horrible late reviews? I don't think that's too hard to figure out. Always trust the later reviews.
B002P73UQW|2.0|When the HD streaming video works, it looks good, but that's less than 50% of the time.  My high speed internet is not the problem as the average throughput is 54Mps (I test it each time I have a video problem).  Besides, it's obvious when the video quality goes down or even stops as it's trying to find a signal because it's 6:00-10:00 pm and everyone apparently is downloading from Amazon.  At 2:00 am/pm the quality is very good, imagine that?  Also, Amazon WAY overcharges for instant video at $39.99 per season.  You can get the entire first 5 seasons (BluRay mind you) for $65.00!!!  I'm the idiot for not researching the price first.  I thought Amazon was an upstanding provider until now.  Oh, these problems also happen at my Parents house too, so it's not &#34;my&#34; internet.  I purchased season 4 & 5 for $27.00 on DVD.  Ugh.
0062502182|1.0|I felt like that the book is not for a serious adult reader. And there is really nothing to get if you want to follow your dream after reading this.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I for one expected the ending not to be wrapped up neatly, as I had read on Sylvia's website prior to reading Entwined that this would be a 5 part series. I'm happy about that because I love these books and characters and want to keep reading their story.<br /><br />This series was my follow up to 50 Shades and I think I've enjoyed these more. I love the depth of the characters and all the different plot lines. Great love story with plenty of steamy sex scenes. Especially liked the concert (from book 2) and bar scene from Entwined.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This was good reading, great romance. You allowed Gideon to completely share his Love and need for Eva. Not to much drama enough to keep you going and not over dramatic. Eva and Gideon facing and challenging their dark past together staying connected to each other showing their strength, and Love that together they will make it happen. I was so excited for the both of them holding and handling all the stuff that was coming at them. I personally think you did wonderful with these characters great work. This makes excellent reading. Hats Off Sylvia good work. I look forward to what is next for Gideon and Eva. Hopefully your next will have them standing stronger together and more in Love as this one. Look forward to it coming.
B000JCSBU0|5.0|I love this movie it is actually well done and the music is amazing. I am happy that this movie is now on instant prime to watch.
0345528581|5.0|This is a complete guide to have a good physical fitness plus the Droid app that can download from the internet for free.<br />I am on the last week of my 10 weeks program,... I have a lower back pain, I thought I am going to skip all the abs part but gradually I tried a couple of it, then once my body learned the movement I found out that my lower back pain is somewhat gone, my poiseture improved and I can do all the abs training.
B00CQGU9GG|5.0|I ordered on Monday and received the following day which was the release date. Great, fast service from Amazon (and it came in the same package as the Rock Show Blu-Ray as well).<br /><br />I listened to the first two albums already and they sound fabulous! I plan to donate my \\"six pack\\" set to a library or something. I wish some other bands would do as good a job as ZZ Top did on these.<br /><br />The package is beautiful, but very minimal; Simple light cardboard sleeves with great art. The Tres Hombres has the gate fold just like on the original album. No liner notes or extra tracks, just 10 great CDs for $40!
B001KT6JPA|4.0|After reading the books, I was curious how the movie followed the story line. I found that they do follow and I enjoyed seeing the story on screen.
1557048630|5.0|I though that this was a well crafted book that gives plenty of insight into the development of the characters from the initial sketches to the final CG renders of the characters.
B004LROUNG|4.0|This is my first Grisham book. I will read more of his books, but by recommendations. I like moves that keep me curious and at the edge of my seat type of feeling. I hoped this book would do the same.<br />This is just one person's opinion. If your a Grisham lover, then you should read it.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|Watched it when it was on Netflix, which they took off the next day. Wanted to share this with the rest of my family, so rented it. Great touching movie.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Had to buy another one because I use my kindle so much. It is so nice to have the cord in more than one room so that it makes charging my kindle a breeze.
B009ZQJVAK|5.0|Love this movie, great storyline and touching characters. I recommend this to everyone I know and eavesdrop on (when they ask what's a good movie).
B001DPHDCY|5.0|my kids love this move and most of my adult friends do to. We have a blast watching this movie.

B007A4SDCG|5.0|Such good work getting to the heart of the matter of resistance, I read this twice last year from the library and now own it on my Kindle as well as the physical copy of the book.  SP's next book &#34;Going Pro&#34; will be my next purchase

B009WO7NQO|4.0|This game is great. It has a large amount of levels but it costs so much in android compared to Google play store. They get it for free.
0893860220|5.0|If you want pure, unadulterated truth, look no further. There's no beating around the bush here. The man knew what he was talking about!
B00CLZ4B4I|2.0|I really wanted to like this move but there just wasn't much to like. Other than the CGI graphics and some of the costumes. I just didn't feel this movie. The acting was a little dull and the story was predictable. But it is a prequel, so I think most people can figure out the story.  And I know this is trivial but even Mila Kunis' costume bugged me. Leather pants?! Really? A long black pencil skirt would have looked better and fit in with the other costumes. I'm glad I rented it instead of spending money on tickets.
B002UHTTWQ|5.0|My favorite book of all time, have read it over and over.  PLEASE release the Kindle edition!!!!!!!!<br />It is available in England why not US
076115678X|5.0|I struggled for YEARS with my curly fine hair. I ordered this book after having my hair cut by a Deva-certified professional. The new cut in conjunction with new products (yes the overly priced Deva line, until I find something better/cheaper that is) and a new way of thinking has resulted in my hair finally looking the way I deserve it to. It's vibrant and bouncy, and even in the daily FL heat and humidity it retains its shape well. I'm still experimenting with products, styling techniques and homemade potions based on what's in this book, and I expect over the next few years to really nail down what works for my hair based on the info (and attitude) I learned in Curly Girl.
B00BC24NT4|3.0|Very confusing time shifting and abrupt ending. Written as a possible movie script with sequels to follow? Uneven pacing makes for a hard read.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I laughed all the way through this book!! Such a funny love story. I don't think I have ever laughed as much at any book as I did this story. This is definitely a 5 star book.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is better than the weather channels by a long shot the interface the accuracy it's all better. I am so glad I switched
0375842209|5.0|I loved this book. I was a little skeptical when I first started reading it because the format and narration was &#34;different&#34;. But once I got past the first handful of pages I was hooked. Enjoy the read.
B003UBTX6S|3.0|Consider  that so much exciting things happened in Beautiful Creatures, I would've expect more. It was good but not great
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It's a huge inspiration to me. Thank you so much for this beautiful book. I need 6 more words. There.

B00ACBN9CI|5.0|and its free. ive seen some really bad flying games on here,  and they weren't free. the controls could be improved,  but it didn't stop me from enjoying the game. I do hope that the developer expands on this title. more missions, multiplayer. would be nice.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|I would have preferred a different ending.<br />Not what I expected. Overall, a good read.<br />Enjoyed the story line , despite the ending.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I am loving the brain stimulation I get from this app. Things that make you say hmmmmm. If you can appreciate a game that actually requires you to think. With great apps like this,  I'd love to see more from MobiGrow.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Me and my 9 year old sister play it all the time on my device I think everybody should play it because they would have lots of fun.

B0063M22QO|5.0|I would recommend it to everyone.  The visuals are great and it has the right number of different puzzles to solve.
B0007939NO|3.0|This is probably classic musical from the era, a little slow moving for now. Not as timeless in quality as some other musicals.
B008EKOIN8|5.0|This is a great book for any cook — beginner to advanced.<br />Not only to you get a feel for the philosophy of what you are eating, but there are numerous tips and tricks for cooking.

B0053O89WY|5.0|I love this series and this season is great. Some new faces but it doesn't take away from the comedy
B008KP6ENE|5.0|This game is very addicting. I can never stop playing. This is a game that will pass the time in anything. But sometimes I play it all day and night that I need to charge I'm Kindle. Download it and see for your self.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I only rated it five stars because I am eating apple pie with ice cream at my lake house. My mom makes the best apple pie ever. My grandma makes the best ice cream.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game gives you many selections to choose between and you can compete against your friends for the highest score!
B00D6BQPMM|3.0|My daughter liked it (she's 16).  I made it through watching with her while working on my computer.  It was cute, though<br />predictable. The high point for me it that it showed zombies as being potentially curable.  In other words... maybe zombies will<br />become extinct and the culture can move onto something else.<br />If you want an entertaining zombie flick to watch with your appropriately aged children, watch Zombieland instead.  Much better movie, much better humor and character development (sort of).
B00BTHWFBK|4.0|PLEASE for all the producers, mixers, engineers and mastering houses around the world ...<br /><br />STOP OVER-COMPRESSING the life out of otherwise great music.<br /><br />This CD is horribly overcompressed everywhere...<br /><br />Iommi's guitars are so compressed that the note clarity of the riffs are lost and squashed.<br />He is playing some great stuff, but with the dynamics killed it is turned into a mushy wall of sludge and noise.<br /><br />The drums seem to be parallel compressed until they sound like loud CLICKS and not round well toned drums.<br />The toms are especially damaged.<br />Hard rock is supposed to have good round toms that are used in fills ... but here they have been compressed and lowered in volume until they are almost gone.<br /><br />The overall mix is then compressed again so much that the LIFE is squeezed out of the music.<br /><br />And where is the REVERB ?<br /><br />We all know excess reverb like we had in the 80s is a bad thing, but BONE DRY does not sound good either.<br /><br />The mixes here are TOO DRY<br />Dry vocals<br />Dry guitar solos<br />NO ..... sounds like rough mixes.<br /><br />As for the music itself, there is some great stuff here.<br />I like the way IOMMI used some classic old riffs in these new songs to impart a kind of nostalgic feel.<br />Some people may call this cheating or re-hashing, but I found it endearing and clever.<br /><br />The bonus tracks are also very good.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE<br /><br />This CD had the potential to be a new masterpiece and a great return of Black Sabbath and their legendary sound ... BUT, the production kills much of the potential of these songs by squashing the life out of the dynamics and compressing the clarity of the riffs into a low-mid heavy sounding sludge.<br /><br />Oh, if only an engineer like Martin Birch, Eddie Kramer or Chris Tsangarides could have supervised this project.<br />Guys like that understand this kind of music.<br />But of course they are all older and/or retired these days.<br />But I would think they could have been recruited to help on this special recording.<br /><br />Unfortunately much of the sonic impact and power of these songs are lost to a style of studio engineering that is more appropriate for rap or hip hop ....... But NOT hard rock music.<br /><br />Iommi, Geezer, Ozzy and the new drummer do their jobs great on 13 ....<br />But the modern, overcompressed, squashed, ultra-dry (zero reverb) production really hurts this music and the songsnd/or retired these days.<br />But I would think they could have been recruited to help on this special recording.<br /><br />Unfortunately much of the sonic impact and power of these songs are lost to a style of studio engineering that is more appropriate for rap or hip hop .......

0307730700|5.0|\\"When Navy SEAL Adam Brown woke up on March 17, 2010, he didn't know he would die that night in the Hind Kush Mountains of Afghanistan--but he was ready. In a letter to his children, not meant to be seen unless the worst happened, he wrote, \\"I'm not afraid of anything that might happen to me on this earth, because I know no matter what, nothing can take my spirit from me.\\"<br />When I read that and felt a chill, I knew that I what I was about to read an incredible book. I was not disappointed. This is the story of Adam Brown, a member of the US Navy's Seal team SIX who became famous when they successfully killed Terrorist Bin Ladin. This is a biography of his early childhood, his troubled teen years in which he fell into a drug problem. His wife, his faith and the US Navy all helped pull him out of a dark place and created an amazing man and solider.<br />The book is full of photographs and deeply personal letters that truly help the reader put a face to those who serve our country and helps grasp the sacrifice these soldiers and their families make.<br />The Toby Keith lyric \\"My daddy served in the Army, he lost his right eye, but he flew a flag out in our yard til the day that he died, rang in my head as I read this book in one setting.
B005S9EJ46|4.0|Movie is great.  Service fast and prompt as usual.  My family and I enjoyed it and we watched as soon as it came.
B006G7R25W|4.0|Music was a little much but film has an exciting story and is worth it. Nice cold war epic if a little dated.
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|Essentially Bruce Willis et al Die Hard fans will not be disappointed. Pay close attention to the beginning tp pick up characters and initiation of plot.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  It is one for all ages from 15 to 80!  Would like a second book of how things turn out for Molly.
B00BTHWFBK|4.0|Well, I just played the full album. Unfortunately it sounds terribly compressed and you can't play this CD very loud at all. I have the vinyl on the way and I hope it is from decent to great in regards to sound quality.<br /><br /> Musically this is a very strong album. I need to play it a few more times to fully get it, but it is definitely a Sabbath album which could have come out right after \\"Sabotage\\". \\"Zeitgeist\\" could have fit right in \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath. \\"Age of Reason\\" reminded me of \\"Vol. 4\\"; specially Ozzy's vocals! Yes, some songs in this album are that good! No, I am not saying this is AS GOOD as those albums, but the organic Sabbath sound from those days is here.<br /><br /> Ozzy's voice sounds very good and much better than in his latest solo albums. I can't hear the Autotune that has plagued his solo work, and that's greatly appreciated.<br /><br /> Overall, I am very happy and this is better than I expected. I know I will enjoy the hell out of this album. I can't wait to see them live in July. As I type this I almost dropped a tear (last song still playing in the background)..... I really love these guys and I can't believe they got together again to put out this very very good album. Hell, maybe it is the Scotch talking since I opened my best bottle to listen to this album tonight.  Such a great band. The people's band indeed; uncompromised sound that only Sabbath can deliver.<br /><br /> PS- I haven't heard the bonus tracks yet.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|I ordered this product thinking it was really cute and my baby would be able to use it when he was a little older and capable of grasping objects. After talking to my sister about it she let me know that it was used in the NICU and the nurses would stuff the animals down the onsies to help keep the pacifiers in the babies mouths. I've since been doing this and it works like a charm. My little one will continually spit out his binkie and then is unhappy because it is no longer in his mouth. When I put this monkey in his onsie he can go slack jaw and the binkie stays put in his mouth so that when he wants it again it is still there. I would recommend this item to everyone with a baby who likes to suck on pacifiers.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I enjoyed it. But it is not free. They really should tell you the cost and that you are getting a teaser. But it does bring back the Nancy Drew game love for me.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Wow, after all the hype and extra wait time for this \\"last\\" book of the Crossfire trilogy and THIS is what we get?? Don't insult your loyal readers by writing a book with no ending just so you can ensure you take more of our money on another book! If you make this book great and follow the basic 'rules' of good writing that is taught to elementary school children that narratives have a beginning, middle and END, we will all buy the next book. Let us buy it because it was such a great read we can't wait to see what's next, not because you blatantly left it unfinished so you can add another book to your publishing list! .. not as clever as another reviewer's comment of \\"Finished with you\\" but I am Disappointed in you!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Like so many other of your loyal fans I waited for months to read this book. I followed your fan club & even preordered it. I cannot believe you let us down so badly. I would have been ok with 2 more books IF this one had not been such a huge disappointment. The only reason I am giving it 2 stars is because I love Gideon's character so much. I will not preorder the next book but instead will wait for the reviews. Hopefully you can redeem yourself with the next hook, but I fear you may have lost many fans forever. Was it worth it? I hope not!
B008MM9630|3.0|Gets tiresome but is entertaining for a little while until the game starts to get difficult if you don't spend money
B00BUVPIRS|5.0|I was very impressed by the graphic for this game.  It works like any other 3rd person game on Tablets and is very smooth in transitions with the Asus transformer.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book locks you in and keeps you hungry for more. It encompasses the struggles and joys of life through the lives of all the characters. A great book highly recommended.
B006R4H5FG|5.0|This book is an essential read for all presenters of all walks of life. It's put me on the right path to becoming a more effective speaker and presenter.
0061353248|4.0|Very easy to read, it gives a very brief introduction to some ideas behind behavioral economics. Great book for someone who is interested in the topic but doesn't have the time to study the science behind it.
B000000W6X|4.0|the tracks with singer Tracy Thorn alone are worth the price. These guys know their stuff. Also, buy 'Blue Lines'.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love playing this game! Definitely worth the download. One of the best quality free apps out there. If you are looking for a fun and challenging game for great quality this is it.
0979019710|5.0|I knew the benefits of the \\"morning risers\\" and I have read a lot about people's morning routine. Beyond that, I have been struggling with waking up early. But after hear about The Miracle Morning... It was like from one day to another. I just started waking up even 2 hours before I usually do.<br />I started 3 weeks ago, and I feel great! It's a really simple and straightforward system to change your life, being a better you, just doing things that you will love. Truly inspiring book. I really recommend it!
B007HUD6OS|3.0|Fun reading but not a book you would expect from Grisham. Younger, smart kids will really enjoy this book. A good lesson in public involvement in important  matters that effect their lives.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Even though I have not finished reading this book, I might say it is a very good book. I will recommend it.
B000HSKUBE|5.0|This was GREAT!!!  I can hardly wait for the next season.  And, the British version is even better, if you can believe that is possible.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|I am enjoying reading this bible. It is a nice electronic edition for my kindle reader. I will recommend it.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|You do not sell books to hollywood unless they are really good! Duh! And this one is no exception. I wanted to read the book before I watched the movie so I read it on Sat and rented it on Sun. I was a little disappointed that hollywood changed the book so much but it certainly did not take anything away from the book. If you like books where the good guy wins the girl and the bad guy loses, this one is for you! Enjoy!
B009NY43NY|3.0|I was a little disappointed in this book.  Most of the books in this series were exciting and imaginative. This one lacked this in almost every way. Come on Charlaine, this was the last book in the series. If you were sick of Sookie, kill her off, don't bore her to death!
193700788X|4.0|I've put off writing this review for the simple fact that I wanted to let it all sink in.<br /><br />For starters, I think it's incredibly unfair for fans of the series to bash the author, and immature for others to make idle threats against her and her books. What purpose does that serve? Sure, everyone had this vision of how the book would/should end, but it ultimately boils down to the fact that it's her story. Obviously she's done her job as an author to bring her readers so close to the characters that they can feel so passionately about their end.<br /><br />That being said, I cannot honestly say that I was overwhelmingly pleased with Dead Ever After. But, it had nothing to do with the ending (as so many others are upset about). My beef with the story was with the lack of a traditional Sookie storyline. Sure, she found a body, sure there were people out to get her, but it lacked the action and excitement of her previous shenanigans. It lacked... Sookie's deep entanglement with the paranormal creatures of Bon Temps.<br /><br />The one thing that I loved most about the book was that, while usually brief, every character that had an impact on Sookie's life over the last 12 books was mentioned or made an appearance. It was satisfying to see that so many of them were given their own HEA's. After all, we grew to know and love them almost as much as Sookie herself.<br /><br />Overall, it was an average, simple ending to what had been an over-the-top, above average series. Would I have preferred a different ending? Absolutely. But what Ms. Harris gave us was an unforgettable series with characters we adore. She introduced us to a world that became our home away from home. And for that, we should thank her.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I've had issues with some of the printed material that come through. Some have typographical error and I'm not quite sure if it's Amazon or the publisher's fault. Nevertheless they should fix it. Otherwise I like the portability.
B000MRTGW4|2.0|I ordered this but didn't check the actual size. It was my own fault for not looking. It was suppose to be a gift for my dad for father's day to go outside because he is always complaining about squirrels and I thought it would be a good outdoor decoration. when I got it I was like \\"what's this? I didn't order this.\\" But after i looked at it i realized it was the statue. But like i said it was my fault for not checking the size. I am keeping it for myself. With that said it is cute as heck and beautifully made. Just much smaller than i expected.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|I'm doing bits of reading here and there with this book. If I had time I would read it in one sitting. Thus far, I love the content and I'm only on chapter 14. Can't wait to have a few minutes of silence to get some reading time in.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game is very fun and addicting.  It downloads and installs seamlessly.  If you love solitare...you will love this spider solitare and won't be able to put it down.  I play it on my kindle fire HD without any problems.  Cards deal quickly and moves very fast.  I love it.
B00AYR2FOI|4.0|Must listen to this as a whole. it was great to hear Boz after 30 split from my last Boz purchase.

B0011BGY66|5.0|Nice to hear some original music.  I enjoy this more than the new one.  Still looking for the vampires. Huh
0684803356|5.0|Forget the Lost Generation stories and The Old Man and the Sea. This is Hemingway's true masterwork, giving more actual insight into a volatile period of world history
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|I have to start this by saying I'm a HUGE John Williams fan.  When I first learned that his iconic music was not to be used in this reboot, I was saddened.  Then, I realized what Zack Snyder was going for...a re-imaging of our hero for this generation...bringing into the light the more human aspects, stressing the MAN in Superman.  Then I heard that Hans Zimmer was to be the composer, and I knew things would just work out.  After hearing his themes for the first time in the 2nd full trailer, I was absolutely enthralled.  Now...hearing the whole soundtrack for the first time, even before seeing the movie,  I'm in love.  This music is heartwarming as well as powerful.  MANY chill-inducing moments.  Several of the softer moments have a kind of ethereal quality, I'm sure to call into play the &#34;alien&#34; nature of the characters and settings, and I think they work very well.  Yes, you can hear bits of classic Zimmer throughout...flavors of his Dark Knight work, Backdraft (especially in &#34;If You Love These People&#34;), and others, and it all works, IMO.  Lots of standout moments, but MAN....give a listen to &#34;What Are You Going To Do When You're Not Saving The World&#34; (I'm assuming it plays at the movie's end), and the aforementioned &#34;If You Love These People&#34;, and just try NOT to be moved...<br /><br />In short, BUY this soundtrack.  Now...the for painful wait to see the movie!!!
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|I purchased all five seasons.  This was truly a quality program.  From the actors to the background landscape, everything was extremely well done.  My only regret is that it is over.  I was so hoping they would do another year.  If you are considering purchasing this, it is a must, it is WONDERFUL.  I really can't recommend it highly enough.  Every week I would wait for Friday night to come so I could watch it, it really is something special!<br />Nancy Ban
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I pre-ordered this book back in Nov. Could not wait for it to come out- I stayed up all night when it finally did- ONLY to have more unanswered questions at the end! I was expecting a hurricane to land while someone gets hit by a bus!! Oh, Wait- that will be in the next one! One thing after another and no end to the story. I HIGHLY doubt I'll buy the next one- oh wait- she decided to make two more out of it! Don't think so!! It's a shame that she had a good story line and corrupted it for money- AND lost a reader.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Enjoyed the read. The story moved at a good pace with lots of suspense. Jack Reacher is becoming a favorite character of mine.
B005ES0ZDU|5.0|I suffer from medicine induced foot problems and the Crocs were suggested to me by a Podiatrist and they are absolutely wonderful.  I love my Crocs.

B001FQIWSK|4.0|Beautiful cinematograpy, exotic locations around the world, exquisite sound track, a fable told by an injured Hollywood stunt man to a little girl in the silent film era - girl has a sometimes unintelligible accent, but acting is first rate. A must see for the serious film buff.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|**_^_**  I truly amazing story which provokes all the human emotions.  A must for any drama/spiritual movie lover.  Beautifully Shot.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I Love this app.  It is really fast, even with a slow internet connection.  Faster than my Ipod.  Pictures load up quickly.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Probably limit viewing to more mature audiences.  We found ourselves looking forward to each new episode.  Not sure if it's historically accurate or not, but it was entertaining.  Much more so than most of what's on broadcast TV these days.
B005N09L5C|5.0|1984 is a novel written a long time ago, and it mirrors what is going on now!  It is scary and prophetic and worth watching.
B001J20ZIA|4.0|Bought this for my 3 year old grandson. It is entertaining enough to keep his attention for the entire movie.  It teaches a good lesson too.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Did not work on my s3, wouldn't even open. When I tried to open it would automatically go to foce close.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|Inspired by the perennial New York Times bestseller of the same name, What To Expect When You're Expecting is a hilarious and heartfelt big screen comedy about five couples whose intertwined lives are turned upside down by the challenges of impending parenthood. Rated PG-13 for crude and sexual content, thematic elements and language, one of our KIDS FIRST! youth film critics, Raven Devanney (age 14) reviewed it this week and \\"laughed through this whole movie!\\" Here's her review:<br />What To Expect When You're Expecting<br />Review by Raven D, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic<br /><br />What To Expect When You're Expecting completely met my expectations. It's the hilarious comedy that follows five couples on their way to becoming parents. It features the wonderful talent of Chris Rock, Cameron Diaz, Elizabeth Banks and many other A-listers.<br /><br />I laughed through this whole movie! The comedy is on point and hilarious and the acting is fantastic. I love that it is from the perspective of many different couples who have different stories and views on what they are going through.<br /><br />My favorite character is Wendy, played by Elizabeth banks, because she has such an organized plan of how her pregnancy and labor will go but she ends up having an extremely difficult pregnancy. She tries to pull herself together, but she falls apart and it is hilarious.<br /><br />My favorite scene is actually when Wendy has her breaking point. It's so funny! I also love that they have the dad's club in this movie because it shows the wacky perspective of a father on parenting and all of the dad scenes made me laugh so hard my stomach hurt.<br /><br />I suggest this movie for ages 13 and up because of mature content and language. Overall I give What To Expect When You're Expecting 5 out of 5 stars.
B00D3LA5WG|5.0|Mud is a modern masterpiece in my opinion. Matthew McConaughey has never been better, the young Tye Sheridan is clearly a rising star,  Jeff Nichols is one of the best young directors working today, and as of June 12, 2013, Mud is the second best movie I've seen in theaters this year. I will definitely be purchasing this DVD and re-watching this phenomenal film for years to come.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|I think it is worth 4 stars because arura costs money and u need it most in the game it rips you off I Hate that!  Besides that I love this game!  I would recommend this game for people who are willing to pay money.
B0067R0APK|3.0|I like the multiple locations available and the pinpoint accuracy of the radar identifiers. I wish it had audible warnings on my Kindle Fire for the local warnings, or even a notice in the status bar at the top. I still check for warnings based on what I notice visually instead of something on my Kindle...which I am on all of the time.

B000OLGCI4|4.0|Bought this to share with my grandchildren.  Love the peppy music, easy for them to learn and sing to.  Never a dull moment.
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|The movie without her was fantastic. So many video game characters I haven't seen in years was awesome. Really the movie is a giant advertisement for video games, candy etc, but because they do it so well it didn't bother me. However Silverman was corny &#34;kinda funny&#34; and really just overdid it. I had many laughs during the film but Silverman with her attempt at being a young spunky spitfire left a poor taste in my mouth. If they hired a real kid or teen to voice her character it would have probably would have been a 5 star. I really do hope Disney makes a part two, just without her.

We love shopping here just about daily.
0136879721|5.0|Occam's Razor is the principle for scientists  as follows:  \\"when you have two competing theories that make exactly the same predictions, the simpler one is the better.\\"  This book is about the most simple solution: spirituality.  Anything that is not tangible, cannot logically explain, \\"feels\\" right, but you don't know why, etc, is in the realm of spirituality.  The brilliance of Joseph Murphy is that he evaluated, studied, analyzed different competing life-theories, and chose the most simple one.  As it turns out, the most simple approach, is the most powerful one.  He brought it to light in a practical, meaningful, almost magical way for an untold number of people-  myself included.<br /><br />In my book: \\"Trauma and Transformation: A 12-Step Guide\\", I fully explore the spiritual side-effects of trauma, and how the 12 Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous is a powerful systematic approach for the trauma survivor seeking a spiritual solution.<br /><br />-Rivka Edery, L.M.S.W<br />Website:  [...]<br />Author of:  \\"Trauma and Transformation: A 12-Step Guide\\".<br />Available from:  [[ASIN:1482785099 TRAUMA AND TRANSFORMATION 12 Step Guide]]
B00C7JGDBW|1.0|STUPID! And that's what The Beast would say about this film. When I was little, I saw the Wizard of Oz, and I was so awestruck by the Wicked Witch that I made up an imaginary friend, who was also a green Wicked Witch, after her. I am an aspiring writer because of the original film.There are people who go to movies to be entertained (like those who gave this movie 5 stars...) and there are those who go to be inspired by the story and relatable characters (those who gave this film 3,2, and 1 star). If Disney does a sequel, hopefully they will take the criticism they received from audience and critics seriously and fix the things that were terribly wrong.<br /><br />Here are my problems with the film:<br /><br />1. Anyone who has seen the musical 'Wicked' knows that the 'womanizing wizard' plot was stolen directly from that musical. I would have appreciated it if Disney had tried something else to make him a 'humbug' than that, considering that it's not that appropriate for children, and also that it's been done before.<br /><br />2. People act like Oscar is the only Disney male to transform from 'not very nice' to 'good guy' when in reality he is one of many, and the least convincing one at that. What about their first 'fraud' wizard Emelius Browne, The Beast, Cuzco, or all of their other male characters who had to change something about themselves in order to become better people? Their changes were truly heartfelt,gradually took place throughout the course of the film, and they had to face the people they harmed and show that they were sorry. None of which happens in the Oz film. Oz doesn't care that he treated Theodora and Evanora like garbage, and he never admits to the Oz people that he had a part in turning them totally wicked. A mark of a truly changed person would be if he had faced them, admitted that he did wrong, and proven to them that he was a good person. Happened in seriously every disney movie of such nature before this one, but not here.<br /><br />3.How can you blame the actors for a story and script that was just plain not well written? Enough said.<br /><br />I am a big fan of the Return to Oz movie, which was better written, had a better story, and was much more creative than this. Regardless of whether there are damaged patients in the asylum, I want to know why that movie is considered to be \\"sooooo disturbing!\\" for simply showing a little girl in a mental hospital?! I was never bothered by it as a child. I had to take 2 psychology courses in college, which I enjoyed very much, and I want to know why simply showing a girl trying to see a psychiatrist for nightmares is so awful? What is the world coming to when people say that a little girl trying to get medical help for nightmares is 'inappropriate to show to kids', yet a movie that teaches kids that there are no consequences for womanizing..... IS? All kinds of terribly violent and disturbing films with demonic themes were never called disturbing like this one, come out in theaters every few months and get multiple sequels. They are probably shown to the same age group that Return to Oz is geared towards by parents who should take heed of the PG-13 and R ratings these films get. Just saying.<br /><br />Both the 1939 and the 1989 films were nominated for Academy Awards. Wizard of Oz was nominated for best music, effects, art direction, picture,cinematography, and it won for music. Return to Oz was nominated for best special effects. I would really appreciate it if anyone tries to make an Oz film next try to shoot for an Oscar contender rather than a summer blockbuster. If it is a great film, people will take notice anyway.

B00CWV8X04|5.0|A great thrill ride with fun twists and turns. Perfect for a cozy movie-at-home night.  The acting is excellent, and each scene leaves you guessing.
1426308469|5.0|Bought it for my niece who loves dinosaurs. The pictures are great and it tells a lot about the different dinosaurs. I even enjoy reading it with her. Definitely recommended.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|My 10- and 11-year-old kids love this game and have a hard time stopping when it's time.  The younger ones enjoy it also, but not as much. Definitely worth having.
0425263924|4.0|I will always love me some Gideon and Eva.<br /><br />While EWY did feel kind of like a filler book there was still enough happening to keep me entertained. There was tons of sex and most of it was way hot. I like that they are communicating with each other more even though some of it was after the fact.<br /><br />It also feels like they have been together for longer than 3 months with all they have been through together already. One thing I'm starting not to like is Cary and his antics and Eva's neediness towards him is getting a little old as well. Hopefully they can work on their issues more pretty soon.<br /><br />I do look forward to what's going to happen in book 4.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Great read! Young romance with highs and lows. Though I am not big into fighting, I like how this book adds that edge to the character. I wish the second book was not from his point of view and just the second novel starting where it left off.
B00992CF6W|5.0|most epic game ever<br />cool the best worth the money now has spawners lava buckets water buckets now has realms cool
B00ALCBU4M|1.0|Nothing like talking English in front of an opera house in Stuttgart, Germany surrounded by a bunch of Germans in the street when you don't want people to know your Americans dressed in German uniforms. Nothing like talking as loud as you can while trying to flee pursuing German soldiers and lighting up a cigarette when trying to be stealth. I guess Germans can't smell or see the smoke coming from behind a tree in the cold of night. Ammo, they got ammo. These soldiers on the run fired thousands of rounds, most of the missing their mark, but enough to kill those nasty bad guys, and the Germans replied with thousands of rounds, mostly missing their mark. Killing all the Germans while standing on top of a moving train was another amazing feet. Germans bad shots, G.I. good, lol. And the final chase scene where a German standing in back of a jeep fires a mounted machine gun (hundreds of rounds) into the back of a fleeing truck.....you guessed. Even the helmets looked plastic.<br /><br />This movie was amazingly bad and I stuck through til the end.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|First of all, let me just say that the format at the beginning of the film is unusual for a reason. It's also in black and white for a while. Don't let that distract you, it's meant to be that way! It changes once you get to Oz, just as in the classic 1939 The Wizard of Oz. Okay, with that being said, this really is a nice, enjoyable movie. It's pretty good to watch with your kids, if you have any. For me, James Franco was the best thing about this movie.<br />Basically, if you're familiar with the original Wizard of Oz, this is pretty much a prequel to that, relating the tale of how the Wizard came to be. It seems to follow the plotline of the 1939 movie fairly closely. If you're a fan of the classic film, then you'll probably really like this one.<br />It's a bit on the predictable side and while there are some really nice computer animated effects, there's not much that is particularly impressive. The characters that run the deepest are Oz and Theodora, but pretty much everyone else you can figure out pretty quickly. There are a few somewhat funny moments, but nothing too memorable. In general, it's just a nice family movie, which probably only kids and diehard Oz fans will want to watch again. I doubt that I will, but for a four dollar rental, it's not bad.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Love this series.  The only reason for not rating it 5 star is, I was disappointed by Robert's flirtation and the servant's use of the ouija board.  Glad to finally see Matthew and Mary's engagement.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|This movie is a must for the youngest child as well as the rest of the family. Before they can walk, little ones will enjoy the music and bounce and dance to the wonderful bouncy music as it begins and ends. The story keeps the whole family enjoying.

B00COGZ8FU|4.0|A bit more \\"cerebral\\" then most of the Tom Cruise movies I've seen, but there is some action. I would recommend this movie if you're in the mood for a movie with plot twists and a surprise bad guy.

B000O599WG|5.0|This is my favorite Western of them all.  Frankly, I think Dean Martin should have had an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of &#34;Dude&#34;, la borrachon.  The film also features the 19 year old, cute as a sparkly button Rick Nelson and the lovably cantankerous Walter Brennan.  Its a triumph of good over evil all the while having to have everything the hard way.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|DKR Pt. II was everything I hoped it would be!  I'm very pleased with how both parts came out and am glad that I bought both.  If you're a Batman fan than these movies are MUST SEE.
B00979CS50|3.0|Similar to the book Waging Heavy Peace, a little like a bunch of mates having a jam in the shed. Nothing new, interesting or ground breaking for Neil Young. Has done much better, not sure if he is back under contract to produce products or just likes this s***, though no s***.
B0059XTTW8|5.0|This movie is as near to perfect as a movie can get. The acting, directing, cinemaphotography, editing and music are brilliant. I rented it first from Netflix first and I held on to it for 2 weeks because I could not bare not having it to watch daily. Yes it's that good. So I had to own this masterpiece.
B000LXQVA4|3.0|My daughter enjoys the jumperoo, and it was working great but the part that lights up and makes noise stopped working after approx 6 months of occasional use..

B0035LGXXO|5.0|I love this movie. It has been the inspiration for many other movies as well as current music. Can't go wrong with a movie that has helped other artists achieve success.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|The Top 5 films at the box office (worldwide) this year are: The Avengers ($1.5 billion), The Dark Knight Rises ($1 billion), Ice Age: Continental Drift ($836 million), The Amazing Spider-Man ($744 million) and The Hunger Games ($645 million). In the US, The Hunger Games ranks third behind The Avengers and The Dark Knight Rises. It's clear that comic book heroes sell, and other key elements are action and conflict. The Hunger Games aims to give us a new fantasy hero to follow after the conclusion of the Harry Potter franchise.<br /><br />Does it succeed?<br /><br />The movie is an adaptation of the first part of a trilogy, written by Suzanne Collins, which was initially aimed at young adults. But, like the Harry Potter series, the trilogy appeals to readers of all ages. I can't comment on the quality of the books because I haven't read them, so I don't know how faithful the movie adaptation is. All I can judge is how well the story works on the big screen. The second movie in the series is set for a 2013 release, while the final part of the trilogy will be split into two movies. So, to answer my question, The Hunger Games is a resounding success as a financial venture and it's enormously popular.<br /><br />Financial success is one thing, but is the movie worth your time? I guess that depends on what you find entertaining. Let me describe what you can expect.<br /><br />***Spoilers ahead***<br /><br />The story opens with a glimpse into the life of Katniss Everdeen (Lawrence). We learn that she lives in one of the poorest of twelve districts in Panem, and that food is scarce. She feeds her mother and sister by hunting for game in the woods and she's a gifted archer. The twelve districts hold a lottery each year to select a boy and girl to represent them. The 24 children will fight to the death and only a single victor will survive. When Katniss sees her young sister chosen, she volunteers to take her place. The chosen boy from District 12 is Peeta Mellark (Hutcherson).<br /><br />That's all we are told about life in District 12. This is not a drama in which we learn about the struggle to live under such a regime, it's more of an action movie. The story moves on quickly and we are shown the sharp contrast between District 12 and the Capitol, where the population is wealthy and the games are seen as nothing more than a form of entertainment. Katniss and Peeta are interviewed on television by host Caesar Flickerman (Tucci). The Capitol is presented as weird and decadent, and most people look like extras from Amadeus. One character looks to be based on Rita Skeeter from Harry Potter. I had the impression that these people were weird for the sake of being weird and it didn't feel convincing.<br /><br />The movie plays out like an American version of Battle Royale with elements from The Running Man added for good measure. Those in control of the game can intervene at will using computers. Sometimes they will send medicine, while at other times they will harm or kill some of the contestants. It's all a grotesque manipulation aimed at entertaining the population in the Capitol.<br /><br />Director Gary Ross is a gifted storyteller, and he also has writing credits for Big, Pleasantville, and Seabiscuit. Unlike all three of those movies, I found that The Hunger Games lacked depth. It's obvious why I am supposed to root for Katniss as she risks her own life to save her sister, but there aren't enough background details to make me connect with her strongly. It felt more like a cynical plot device than anything that was remotely real.<br /><br />So, for me, The Hunger Games became something of a comic book. There is an attempt at showing group dynamics. Who will work together? At what point will they try to kill each other? Who will take their chances alone? What skills will each of the characters have? How inventive will the deaths be? But the attempt is flawed because some of the most dangerous contestants are displayed as sneering idiots, and it detracts from the seriousness of the situation. This is supposed to be a battle for survival, not a comedy?<br /><br />I'm trying to give a balanced review, but some of the battles are rather silly. That's not to say that the movie doesn't have a few good moments. One alliance in particular did resonate with me and I reacted emotionally to the death of one character.<br /><br />My overall impression is one of sadness. Not because of the death of some of the characters, but at what we are becoming as a society. Do we really need to see children fight to the death in order to be entertained? As with modern comedies, we are relying more on shock value than good writing. Katniss Everdeen was portrayed well by a promising actress, but original ideas were few and far between. You know almost exactly what to expect from The Hunger Games before it begins, and most events are thoroughly predictable.<br /><br />The next three movies will be a huge success, I am sure, but I'm not anxiously awaiting their release. I'm glad that I avoided The Hunger Games in theaters and waited to borrow the Blu-ray from a friend. Don't label me as a prude or someone who is against violence in movies. One of my favorites is Kill Bill, but, unlike the portrayal of Katniss Everdeen, I was shown enough background to care about what happened to The Bride.<br /><br />This movie does have a huge audience as I outlined at the beginning. If you are the kind of moviegoer who enjoys action, good presentation, and special effects, The Hunger Games will entertain you. You'll need to switch your brain off for a couple of hours, but movies like this do have their place. I guess that's why they get made. I am left wondering about the book and how much was left out. Don't let this review stop you from buying the Blu-ray (which looks and sounds fantastic) or checking out the movie for yourself. I'm clearly in the minority on this one.
B004P7CMUU|5.0|I enjoyed watching this movie on television and decided to purchase the dvd for my collection.  Of Sir Anthony Hopkins can do no wrong. . . his acting is superb.  I recommend this film to all who don't know what the word 'passing' means in the racial context.  Well done and would like to see more like this.  Thank you.
B0053TMP24|5.0|I read the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series and it was awesome I loved this book and I also liked the firs one
0345803485|1.0|I'm a dreamer, and I am all for erotica but this book nothing as all on both counts. Its just childish and makes me wonder why it been chosen as a Romantic book. As far as I'm concerned, there is no romance in the book. The girl is in love with a billionaire and i am sure there will many women willing to give in to his demands when he has that kind of money and power. But what's new, isn't this what most BDSM movies are made of a Dom and a Sub, what's exceptionally romantic about it, i fail to understand. To me this is just a novice writing her fantasies like many a teenagers do in there diary....a story about a Mills and Boon billionaire, who is heads over heels in love with a nobody...only difference this Prince comes with a contract of submission. So disappointing!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Saw the movie but got a deeper view with the book. Have ongoing discussions with colleagues regarding the meaning/ symbols, illusion versus reality , the meaning of the floating island and the tree.  I will be discussing this book for months ahead.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|Yup I love this game so much &lt;3<br />It's great and makes me feel like a good an  responsible person. I might be a little too into it LOL.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|This book was very engaging. It kept me interested to the very end.  I liked how the author related to the meanings of flowers and had never previously thought about flower meanings/messages until reading this book.  The characters were fully developed and it was easy to understand their motivations, feelings and meanings for their actions, which is always important to me in a book. The descriptiveness of the writing allowed me to stay with the story. A good book takes a person to places and/or situations where one has never been - that is the joy of reading. This one did the trick.
B009JZWYKQ|3.0|watched the movie it surprised me towards the end, unexpected on this one. enjoyed the movie though. Entertaining,<br />Tarantino is a beast
B005LAIH2C|5.0|I regret nothing though.  It never really took itself seriously, and so the over the top stupidity worked all the way through.  There doesn't appear to be any deep thought or meaning here.  Just trite and shallow jokes about witches and fairy tales set against a mixture of modern and fantasy tropes.<br /><br />A real pity they decided not to offer the unrated version on DVD.  There might have been more breasts in it.
B000YJ54DU|1.0|Too lengthy. Too many superfluous paragraphs.  Very hard to follow  Not worth the time to read. Love Reacher just not this one
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|There are no timers in this game, and no runaway babies if you miss a day of play. Interacting with the animals seems to make catching others of that type much easier.<br />I do wish there was a game that rewards peanuts or a collectable one perhaps like some of the coins you collect from open space in the zoo.<br />I haven't been able to invite friends and I am not sure where the disconnect for this is.<br /><br />I do love the graphics and sound effects, and the way the animals dance when you pet them is an appreciated and unexpected surprise.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|A beautiful and heart wrenching story about what makes life worth living, even a short one containing loss and suffering.

B001JIFYSA|5.0|&#34;Love Actually&#34; is so cleverly written and acted and so devoid of Hollywood rom-com cliches that even someone like me, who lumps romantic comedies with overripe bananas and syrupy desserts, can watch it over and over and find new things to laugh about.  Highly recommended!
B00BXUG0KU|5.0|This is my 2nd CD of Eliane Elias and I love it.  Her playing is outstanding and her vocals on the songs of Chet Baker are mesmerizing.  I loved her CD Songs of Bill Evans but this CD has the added benefit of her many throaty vocals that are fabulous.  If you are a jazz fan this CD is a MUST!
193700788X|5.0|I'm sure it's always a challenge for an author to end a long-running series such as this one, with fans invested in the characters and their &#34;ever after.&#34; As far as I'm concerned, Charlaine Harris came through with flying colors. The writing was smooth and so easy to get through I was dismayed by how fast I was getting through it, even though I couldn't sit down and read the book all in one sitting. Thanks, Ms. Harris, for a wonderful set of characters and an interesting world that was so believable. I gave up on the tv series a while back because it seemed to get so crazy, but I never gave up on you.
B00BIVN82M|4.0|Another example of Michael Buble's knack for presenting &#34;Standards&#34; in his smooth & easy style!  Good selections especially Tracks one and twelve!
034554398X|5.0|Cover-to-Cover the best book I've ever read. Whether it was the fact that my investment with the characters were already strong thanks to the two previous installments or just the storyline, this book has something for everyone. Thrilling, breathtaking, and heartbreaking are the words that come to mind when thinking about the book.
B000002JAX|5.0|Her venture into a bit of Country is refreshing but my favorite track is &#34;la vie en rose&#34;.  Her voice quality never varies and, as always, the sound of &#34;Billie&#34; finds it's way into her vocals.  &#34;Dreamland&#34; is a great addition to my collection of her CD's and will be to yours, too.
0553582038|4.0|Coming off \\"A Storm for Swords\\" hurt this novel. Very well written and great foreshadowing make this novel rewarding. Although missing some of our favorite characters, Martin introduces new ones and takes us to locations previously unknown. I feel that this book will be better looked upon the further we move into the saga. Extremely underrated!
B00BHNQ5XK|2.0|Now that I've seen this movie, I am very surprised that the majority of ratings were four stars and above. Based on this high rating, I rented it from Netflix and was very, very disappointed. Warning: there are some spoilers below.<br /><br />The cast seemed impressive. I generally like Ethan Hawke, Fred Thompson, and (especially) Vincent D'Onofrio (who was uncredited....probably by choice), but this production gave them little to work with. Ethan Hawke spent virtually the entire movie roaming the house, in the dark despite nearby light switches, being startled every 10 seconds by things we've all seen before....items appearing from nowhere, weird faces in photos, scorpions, snakes, falling through the floor, etc. What was particularly annoying is that the director was not content with simply letting the shock value of each revelation speak for itself, but chose to accompany each of them with a blast of noise so loud that it made you jump off the couch. Fred Thompson did the best he could with his \\"cranky sheriff\\" part, but Vincent D'Onofrio never directly appeared in person, relegated instead to a talking image on a computer screen, providing all the plot exposition necessary to make some sense of what was happening.<br /><br />The prevailing feeling throughout the movie was that I had seem it all before, and done much better. The idea of an ancient demon making life miserable for innocent folks was done long ago....in Ghost Busters, for one. The progressive deterioration of a father being driven crazy by events in a house....in the Shining and Amityville Horror. The threat to children by paranormal forces....in Poltergeist and about 98 other movies. In short, there was not a single original moment in the entire film. If you have been watching movies for even a few years, you have already seen it all before....and probably done much better. Add to that the fact that this movie lasted for almost two hours, occurred almost entirely in the dark (turn on the lights !!!), and dragged so horribly, that inadvertent naps were not only inevitable, but almost a relief.<br /><br />A horror movie is only as scary as its villain, and in this case, the ancient demon, I forget his name, was a joke. He reminded me of just how awful Exorcist II was (remember good old Pazuzu?). Indeed, I have seen more convincing demons at my door on Halloween; and, let's face it, the whole \\"ancient demon\\" concept has been done to death. The moment Vincent told us who was responsible for the mayhem, I rolled my eyes and almost reached for the STOP button on the remote. You KNOW a movie you have selected is lousy when members of your family progressively lose interest, wander off to do other things, and you end up all alone, marinating in the misery of your own poor judgement.<br /><br />Avoid this embarrassment and leave this turkey on the shelf or otherwise un-rented, un-purchased, and most importantly, un-watched. After all, if you've watched almost any other horror movies before, you've already seen it.
0061122092|2.0|In many ways this book feels like a shorter version of the Witch of Portabello, which I didn't enjoy either.  I'm thinking Coelho should give up on trying to create a female voice, it never rings true for me. In this instance, I felt like the narrator was shallow and a bit selfish. I'm not sure why she deserves to achieve her goals and her awakening was a bit hurried and trite. Frankly, the subtitle is lost on me - I don't know what there was to forgive in this text. Coelho's novels are often inspiring and promote self reflection (The Alchemist, Veronika Decides to Die, The Pilgrimage). This novel falls short on all accounts. It lacks character development and focus. I was, for the first time, disappointed by Coelho.
1476729719|2.0|This is a prime example of an author taking a perfectly reasonable 250 page book and stretching it out to 650 pages.  The book dragged in a tedious and trying way.  When the plot of the book is released early on, mystery, interest, or intrigue are a challenge to maintain.  People kept rehearsing the same tired lines much like a soap opera.  I have to admit, I skipped or skimmed whole chapters and never missed anything; the people were engaged in the same dialogue.  Furthermore, none of the characters were engaging.  Even the courtroom passages were routine.  I found that empathy for any of the characters was never forthcoming.  The cast seemed to be an unlikeable group of emotional misfits.<br /><br />This criticism does not, however, deny the seriousness of the subject.  Bullying, the availability of guns, and repeated school shootings should be a concern for everyone.  Hopefully, schools are being more attentive to the safety and well-being of their students.  So much could have been done to change the outcome of this book.  It called into accountability both parents and school staff and their need to be sensitivee to the needs of all students, not simply focusing on over rated athletic talent and sport performance.
B005LAIH2W|2.0|As a single movie, taken on its own and relative to nothing, it's okay.  The characters and backgrounds are visually interesting, and some of the action is cute.  But it all ends there, unfortunately. It misses the incredible depth of drama and feeling that is in the great ones, like \\"Star Wars\\" and \\"Avatar\\"; you ALWAYS know it's campy and unreal, a Disney flick, like a cartoon, without even the drama of \\"Bambi.\\"<br />  Most of the characters are okay, and, as I said earlier, cute; Taylor Kitch is actually workable as JC, but Lynn Collins, although certainly a cute chick, is a typical cookie-cutter cutie, which Hollywood has a million of; she is not the powerful, exotic, and captivatingly gorgeous figure who is essentially queen of an entire planet in Dejah Thoris, which is no doubt one of the reasons why the movie did not do very well in the box office.<br />  Granted, many of the viewers did not read Burroughs' books and many did not see Frazetta's art of the theoretical and magnificent Princess of Mars, but they certainly didn't get that image from the movie.  Either from Collin's acting, or the directing, the Dejah Thoris we see in the movie is a \\"valley girl\\" who is mildly interested in the \\"biker dude\\" from Earth, and plays it like that.  The story, as Burroughs penned it, is a powerful one where a man's enormous love for the Princess of the planet causes him to want to be there with her, and her enormous love for him, from his battle and many attempts to help and save her, causes her to love him the same way.  The powerful and emotional love story, much like the drama of Romeo and Juliette, is totally absent from the movie.  It is hinted at here and there, but never portrayed.  Whether one likes love stories or not, \\"A Princess of Mars\\" was written as that.  Carter doesn't love the planet, he loves this incredible and exotically beautiful girl!  And she is a magnificent creature which causes a man to leave his own home and planet and forces him to stay therefor life with her.  In the movie, we have a guy who loves battle, finds a cute chick he can hook up with, and so he decides to hang around for awhile.  And for her, he's a nice distraction and a better option than the moron guy she was forced into marriage with: WEAK!<br />  Thus, what we see is a move without much of a story, not much of a romance, and not much of a purpose for being; it's more like a slice of life, Martian style. It loses the original majesty and power of Burroughs' novels.  Even the weekly Star Trek movies of TOS had more drama and emotion in them than this entire movie. Those who loved it are easily entertained by flash & spectacle, not story or brilliant acting. Is it worth it to see?  Sure, as light entertainment to eat popcorn by, but not as something dramatic or meaningful, which the Burroughs' stories are.  And the thing is, it costs just as much to make a weak movie as a meaningful one.  Look what Cameron did with \\"Titanic\\"!
B00008CMR6|4.0|I am a John Wayne fan .I like most of his movies, especially westerns.<br />This was no exception! Good movie in the John Wayne mode!<br />I enjoyed it, and suspect others like me would ! That is what kept him so popular all his life.<br />I would recommend this movie!
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|I've listened through this a couple of times now and I have to say that this is probably one of Hans Zimmer's most experimental soundtracks.  He is really trying some new stuff here and blending it in with the traditional Zimmer sound.  It is indeed an &#34;epic&#34; soundtrack.  It sounds &#34;big&#34; and some of the pieces have a lot of unique combinations of instrumentation going on.  You can hear drums, violins, guitars, weird keyboard sounds, and a host of other different instruments all in the same piece.  Now I know he has done some of this before...but it just sounds...bigger here.  It is almost as if Zimmer knows he is the man...he knows that he has developed quite a following for his scores and he is really trying to push the envelope here.  Some might say that it just sounds like a rehash of some older stuff...or that maybe he just reuses material (like some film composers do)...but I don't think so here.  Superman is a big character...a very &#34;cartoony&#34; character.  The music and this film are really trying to make it more realistic and believable.  Kind of like what they did for Batman.  There is no John Williams theme here and I don't mind that at all because I think that is exactly what they are trying to get away from.  It is interesting that the first track however does remind me of Planet Krypton from the original movie.  Very slow...almost quiet and then it builds and builds...it sounds great.  The only thing that I didn't like in this score is that weird keyboard sound combined with an electric guitar.  This mix happens occasionally in the score and it just doesn't seem to fit for me.  It reminds me of some Vangelis &#34;Bladerunner/Chariots of Fire&#34; stuff.  It seems a little out of place for me.  Overall, I think this is a great score and it has Zimmer doing some new and interesting things.  The deluxe package comes with an extra CD with additional music and has liner notes/pictures that gives some insight on the behind the scene making of the score.  It is well worth it if you are a Zimmer fan and soundtrack collector.  I recommend the soundtrack highly.ng of the score.  It is well worth it if you are a Zimmer fan and soundtrack collector.  I recommend the soundtrack highly.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|Darius continues to grow his musical range.  He once said \\"It takes a real man to sing Barry Manilow\\" .  His last few albums have shown that he is the man. Long time fan from his days working as a bartender at JD Sticky's in Columbia.
B00CDSIMI4|4.0|This game score is pretty interesting.  There are a lot of possible ways that the composer could of handled this score and the one that he choose wasn't what I was expecting...but in the end it fits really well.  Don't expect grand orchestral sweeps or pulse pounding end of the world &#34;zombie&#34; music.  This score primarily uses acoustic guitars and sometimes even banjos to create a &#34;out in the big country by yourself&#34; feel.  I dare say that some parts of this score could easily be used in a western themed game or movie.  It gives off this feeling of being out in the untamed lands of the west and it works well.  There are some tracks that do have a very eerie slow creeping tension and some tracks capture a sense of hopelessness that the characters must feel in this world.  I haven't played the game yet so I don't know how this all works or is connected in the game but I kinda get the sense where the composer is going with this.  At times the composer uses an instrument to compliment an emotional effect...such as track 8 &#34;All Gone&#34; and in other areas he creates a particular mood for the overall effect using only a few instruments.  This is, of course, what all good film/video game composers do.  The music becomes an emotional sound extension of the world in which they are creating and it works here.  I like it.  I can listen to it on it's own and enjoy it and I am sure that it is going to work great with the game as well.  It isn't a distracting collection of tense noisy action music but more simple and somber.  I can listen to this driving...probably would work best down a long lonely country road...and I can enjoy it in the background while I'm doing work in my office.  If you love and appreciate soundtracks, then I recommend this one for you collection.  If you become a fan of the game, I can imagine that you'd want this one too.
1476715904|5.0|Slammed is one of my all time favorite books, and I have read many. Although the plot, if broken down vey simply, can be relatable to other books, it is a one of a kind. A rare sight in this day and age. There are life lessons and insightful moments on every page that are relatable to in one way or another. This book took my breath away and throughout different parts of the book you are slammed with emotion. This book really grabbed hold of my emotion, and even got me to write my first review! A definite must read and recommendation.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Great way to wind down before bed. Not sure I can follow the &quot;story&quot; but it doesn't matter. Nice music as well.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This extraordinary piece of literature is written so perfectly well that it astonishes me how it ends. It makes me wish for a sequel so much, that even I,  a 200-speed-reading human,apparently living in the world of \\"middle school and fast food\\" am considering writing a sequel to the marvelousness that Mitch Albom has created.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|This was a must read after watching the Hunger Games movie. I was happy to see that the movie had followed the book fairly well. Now after reading this Trilogy I look forward to future movies in this series.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I had used swype for a couple years..  But got tired of constant typos.  Typos that I could not get swype to delete.  I decided to try SwiftKey and have been very happy I made the change. .  Take the time to watch the youtube videos that help you learn the basics of the application..  Also let the app &quot;learn&quot; from your email, texting and twitter accounts.  It has made my speed and accuracy much better.
B008XBHIEY|4.0|This movie is an original, great to watch. A little slow so if you're looking for fast pace it isn't this but it's still entertaining.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book... I am really looking forward to the movie. It was such a great read , it only took a day to read the whole thing.
B003SI3URQ|5.0|This is a great family film and has a good message to it. I could watch it over and over again and still enjoy it.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I really enjoyed all three books however the second was the best . I felt like I was transported to a science fiction film for the third. I feel a bit let down in the aspect of  the relationships.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Doesn't look like it would be a great movie but it really kept me hooked into the story line. Certain things seem maybe just a little cheesy but what action movie doesn't have that. Rent it, watch it. It's good.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Bought for my daughter, because she couldn't wait until one was available from the library, she enjoyed it almost as much as she had the first two books. Since I didn't personally read the book, I can't describe it's contents, but know that it is part of a very popular series.
B00AYHKIZ6|4.0|This is different. It is amazing the transformation Bowie has gone through since is Ziggy Stardust days. Punk rock to popular music.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Fun. Challenging. Just wish I was getting paid for bagging all these groceries! It's a mindbender and a great way to pass the time!!
B008M87GJK|5.0|I think that the BBC News is one of the most comprehensive news programs out there. Always on the ball and they have the most educated of reporters who hardly miss a beat.
B009S33I68|5.0|There are not many books I feel the immediate need to re-read the second I finish it, but this was one of them. I have always had an intense fascination for history and in particular WWII. Recently I wanted to expand my knowledge to include Vietnam, and this was one of the first books I picked up about the war. And I am glad I did.<br /><br />The book is incredibly detailed. The amount of research and the intense eye for details are frankly incredible. At first it was a bit overwhelming with all the names and background of the soldiers involved, but I quickly grew to feel like I knew them.. and when things went wrong you felt a sadness that only a masterful writer can bring up in the reader. I truly felt like I was there with them and could clearly see the battlefield in my mind as I kept reading page after page.<br /><br />The soldiers involved in the Ia Drang battle showed incredible courage, amazing character and a caring and love for each other that society in general could learn a lot from. While thrown into what must have been a living Hell they stood their ground and let their excellent training guide them through. It must have been very hard for these soldiers to go back in time and live through these days in detail again, but I am glad they did because the end result is incredibly gripping.<br /><br />This book should definitely be read by anybody who are interested in war history, Vietnam or the military. The leadership skills shown are something any leader, military or civilian, can learn a lot from. The rest of us need to read it to try to understand what happened, understand the stress the soldiers went through and remember. Remember and never forget.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|He has read almost every single one more than once.<br />Along with the adventures of ook and gluk which he also loved.
B00338QENI|5.0|Even though this book is about cells and science, I was still mesmerized by the story.The author presented the material in a clear manner.  I felt empathy for all the main characters.  Anyone interested in history should read this book.
B00AK57N00|4.0|I like this game a lot. I wish there was a little more to it but thats my only complaint!
B005S9EK5Y|2.0|SPOILER ALERT!!!<br />I agree with other reviewers about some of the weaknesses in the cast (Crowe, especially, and you really need an amazing singer for Valjean - Jackman tries, but he falls short) - the movie disappointed on many levels, despite having a handful of good scenes. Furthermore, the comic value of the Thenardiers was significantly hampered by the lack of a live audience - they interact with the audience so much in the live musical, and that is where much of the fun comes in. Without that element, it was stale. HB-C far outshone Cohen, as well - she outacted him so thoroughly it was a bit distracting. Almost as distracting as the fact that Crowe never showed up and can't sing. Jackman would likely have done a much better job if he hadn't been acting into a Crowe-vacuum. The tension between Javert and Valjean was missing, because Crowe was just... absent.<br /><br />Marius was brilliant. Perhaps the best I've ever seen. And Cosette was great. I did love Hathaway's Fantine. The extra scenes did add a fair bit, in most cases. The movie has some real strengths, in other words.<br /><br />However, my main problem with the movie is the last scene. In the end of the movie and the musical, there is a sense of the vision of God's peaceable kin-dom - remember the lyrics to the song, \\"they will walk beside the ploughshares, they will put away their swords; the chains will be broken, and all shall have their reward\\" - that's from the Bible, Isaiah and Joel both contain that message, as well as other places. The idea of \\"climbing to the light\\" - really tries to focus the transition from war to peace, from division to unity, from injustice to equality... and Hugo wrestled hard with those topics in the book. He wasn't a total idealist about it, but he really wrestled - and the saint of the book is clearly the Bishop, who is a complete pacifist, egalitarian, etc. Hugo tried to convey a truly Christian (as in, Jesus-based, not church-based) vision. The Bishop in this movie was decent, but he still didn't do justice to Hugo's Bishop.<br />So in this movie, the very last scene, when you see the people who have been killed and are now in heaven.... they are all waving flags and guns. Flags and guns. What happened to beating swords into ploughshares? What happened to unity, transcending national divisions?<br />It's really, really sad and anticlimactic. It leaves the viewer feeling a bit sick rather than uplifted. In the musical, when they sing \\"who will be strong and stand with me? Somewhere beyond the barricade, is there a world you long to see?\\" a lot of times the audience will leap to their feet - you can hardly help it - we all long for that vision of the kin-dom of peace and light. But in this movie, we are invited to join in a vision of.... flags and guns.<br />If they had just gotten this part right, I could forgive them much of the rest of it. But for this enormous betrayal, I give the movie two stars.
B002I0J5FG|2.0|I just received my order and I havent played it yet im sure the games are great but the condition of my \\"new\\" product wasnt my case is chiped on the side were you open and due to the location of the fracture when I open it the next few times it is sure to expand the disc however is fine and it was factory sealed so not entirely the sellers fault I guess I just got some bad luck
B00AYHKIZ6|4.0|This CD could have been made 30 years ago, as Bowie left the studio fot the last time. He just continued on.
1781162646|5.0|This was the 32nd book that I read by Stephen King.  And it was the only one I can remember making me cry.  Just as George R. R. Martin's \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" series uses high fantasy to set the stage for a story that is really about human emotions, this story uses a haunted amusement park to tell a story about a twenty one year-old boy who is coming to terms with mortality in the forms of a choking child, an elderly man, a murdered teenager, and a sickly child.  This story was incredible, I would recommend it to genera and literary readers alike.
B00AGOGOLE|1.0|you can't delete photos or videos, there's nothing to tell you how to share pics, nothing, complete joke and a waste of money.  Developers should rot in hell

044024613X|3.0|I definitely wanted to know how it turned out, but I had a hard time believing the ending. I can't say much more without giving too much away, so I'll just say I'd probably only recommend it to someone who is able to suspend belief for the sake of a pretty good read.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|You are so excited about that you made this game and I love it and I am ready to play with the rest of the game
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini once again captivates the reader in a non stop read. His new novel will hold the  reader prisoner until the last paragraph. Then the reader can reflect on the story lines, the characters, the brilliance of the story teller with sadness that the reading experience is over.
B002HFJ77S|5.0|This story has Kinsella's signature witty and painfully humorous storytelling.  In addition there is a thoughtful and sentimental plot that will pull you into the emotion and make you think about your own life and family.
B00CVSMLXS|5.0|I bought this entire series and have watched all of them at least once.  I think, in my opinion, it is one of the best series I have seen in a long while.  I hope the coming season proves to be as good or better!  Watch it, I think you'll enjoy it.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|....Thank God, there is more to the story, I couldn't have believed that there would be no more!!! Their story is luscious and so much more!!! It couldn't end without the rest of their story, like what happened to Megumi, did Elizabeth Vidal ever start to believe her son, their beautiful wedding, Eva's mom and Victor Reyes... Etc...!!! I'm I love with this couples screwed up life, wishing and hoping for my beautiful Gideon Cross to come into my life, and just so you know, Sylvia, Crossfire is now my safeword from now on...!! My fends who know the book and heard me the other night while I played, heard me say my safeword is 'Crossfire!!' Everyone laughed so hard!!! No he's not my Gideon, but I'll find him one day!!! Thank you for their beautiful story!!
B00821OX98|5.0|Love the interaction between the characters as they fight alien intruders.  The plot and story line are well written.  A must see for sic-fi aficionados!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app is so easy and useful. To be able to set an alarm w such accuracy of when you need it at different times...And its FREE!
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|This was an excellent movie! A tiny bit slow in the beginning, but a kick tailed middle and MIND BLOWING ending!!!<br />Disney is going to do their thing, but this is a movie for the family. NO SEX. NO LANGUAGE. LOTS OF SPECIAL EFFECTS. A movie that follows its conclusion. The long ago ability to understand everything, from his magic, to its beginnings. Something for everyone one, built on a simplistic love story. Wrapped in faith in mankind, goodness, and I can't wait to see THE NEXT one!!
B001EN71CW|5.0|One of the best sci fi shows out there.<br />I loved how it focused most of its time on its characters, all of whom had diverse backgrounds and interesting history, as opposed to on special and visual effects.<br />It was such a shame they had to cancel this excellent series.
B009YN2M7S|4.0|I loved it!!!! Sooo much it was great i think the movie . Will be great too i havent seen it yet
B00CE004XM|4.0|Not as bluesy or as good as &#34;Don't Explain,&#34; but a truly great performance by Beth and Joe. Thank you for your contribution to my collection.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This game is so much fun and very addicting .It is so worth the money.it does not<br />have any adds
B003468H1G|1.0|I dislike the seventh season that has been sent to me.The dvd's have a restriction on them, I can not play any of the disks on our DVD player. They will only play on my computer. Not Happy at all!!!
B00BTHWFBK|4.0|For classic Sabbath lovers, the perfect combination together again. It seems like the cancer menace gave the riff maestro deep inspiration. Ozzie's voice is  never what it was but he was well produced , so this is a delicious treat for all the fans and newcomers alike. Very good monumentaly heavy songs, excelent production IMHO.
B00C061HZY|5.0|Daft Punk is awesome. I love how they have done this album. My first impression was mixed, I was surprised that there was no music that seemed to fit the (at that time) Daft Punk formula, no techno house anthems so to speak. However after I continued to listen to it more and more I really fell in love with the album. Daft Punk could of churned out another electronic album, they know how to do it, very well in fact but they chose to explore other avenues of music and for that I have great respect. The electronic music scene today is boring and generic and Daft Punk did not want to sell out to it, respect. The robots will be back with more electro so I am not worried about that, hopefully this album will shake some of the bros off the Daft Punk bus. Daft Punk is awesome.
1594204217|3.0|Maybe I should not be rating this as I did not finish it.  The style of writing made it very difficult for me to enjoy. In fact, it was uncomfortable enough that I chose not to finish it, something I very seldom do.  However, if you are okay with this author's style of writing, the subject is fascinating.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Martin still has it in him to paint a picture with words. Although parts of the books drag, you can't help but feel that this is a build up to an eventful next book. Another weak point is the many character perspectives that this book has, which makes it more difficult to follow than the ones before . A great read all in all.
1451668945|5.0|I bought this as a birthday gift for my 80-year-old mother & she's loving it so far. She's a big MHC fan.

0679805273|5.0|Dr Seuss knows how to say things in a way that resonates with all ages. My high school graduate appreciated that this was his card (money included, of course) and we think that passing it on will become a new tradition.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I would have given this book 5 stars if I wasn't so totally disappointed with the ending.  I'm not a big fan of the latest trend in publishing of the \\"to be continued\\" types of book series.  I like my books to have a more stand alone type of quality to them.  For whatever reason ,prob. because most of these series seem to be 3 books, I thought this was the final installment.  WRONG ANSWER!  Entwined's ending was so unsatisfying I almost wish I had waited for the next book so that I could read them together.  This installment just added more questions with little to no answers.  The authors note at the end said something like \\"yes dear readers Gideon & Eva's story is not done\\"  YA THINK?? I will read the next installment, after reading this one you really kind of have to, because I love these characters but I can't help but feel like the reader's are being taken advantage of.  At $15 for a print copy and around $10 for the ebook this is getting to be a very expensive story.  Luckily for me I was able to borrow the last 2 from my local library or I probably wouldn't be able to afford it.
B008OM0EDO|3.0|Sacha does a good job trying to be funny in this movie but the plot line doesn't help much here.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|My original kindle charger cord was crumbling apart. I called Amazon customer service and they replaced this for free. Excellent customer service. I was pleasantly surprised.
B009JCL58G|4.0|Some movies have &#34;detachable&#34; soundtracks. When you play the music on its own, it fits right into whatever you're doing. A few songs on this soundtrack fit into that category - the ones that employ the main Cloud Atlas theme - and because I love that main theme, the soundtrack was worth buying, for me. But most songs on this CD aren't noteworthy in my mind, and don't really support a relaxing or exciting or pleasant atmosphere... even though they worked well in the movie. So if you get this OST, plan to do some weeding before you're happy.
B0014KA0EG|5.0|I haven't listened to this album thoroughly since I was in High School and now appreciate it more than ever. I caught Alice in Chains recently in San Antonio at the River City Rockfest, and was stunned at how great they sounded live with Duvall at lead. Lots of Dirt - go see them if you get a chance.
B00COGXGNQ|1.0|Oh, it's got all the ingredients for your typical Sparks film:  Waterside set, B list actors, young children they nearly kill off to give your heart a little flutter.  I usually like cliched romantic movies.  They make me incredibly happy that I have a normal, healthy relationship with men instead of what the entertainment industry wants me to desire.  However, this movie was just TOO predictable, TOO dry and didn't have any chemistry between the two main characters.  Where is the witty dialogue and on screen sparks?
B008KP6ENE|3.0|I obtained this game for kids. It is difficult to reach all the levels, which makes it impossible to unlock additional options.
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|Love this movie!  The writers delivered a great script and the cast pulls it off flawlessly.  You really dive into this one!  Go ahead and buy it, this is a movie you'll want to see twice (AT LEAST)!
B00C7JG0KG|3.0|Disney I am just not buying this movie without 3d, blu ray, dvd. It's just plain greed. When Disney releases the movie like I said I will buy it.
B002TLSSXO|4.0|Fantastic set for the price but I didn't purchase the set with the counter storage stand because I've got too much going on the counters as it is.  The super thick handles are great when you're using them but they take up a ton of space in the drawer and it's impossible to fit it in my vase bouquet of other utensils because of the thick handles as well.  If you have a lot of drawer space this is the set for you!  If you've got a small kitchen, move on.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|The trailer for this film doesn't do it justice. It's a humorous and sweet story with a dash of action and suspense--something for everybody!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Third time I have read this book, love the story. Would highly recommend this book to anyone. Can't wait for the movie
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|Rented the movie but didn't watch it due to the format. Even when the video is maximized to full-screen on a pc it only takes up about half the screen and there's no way to make it bigger. Obviously a problem on Amazon's end not a problem with the movie itself. I want my money back.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|So, all that i can say about this game is that it's the best ever and that i often spend an hour in bed at night playing it instead of sleeping.
B005LAIH2M|4.0|Saw this movie at the theatre & thought it was good enough to buy.Great special effects.Love the story line too.
B007N31YZ2|2.0|Only benefit to this film is Blu-ray quality. Everything else is extremely edited at PG, compared to dvd limited edition.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|A brief Review for The Man of Steel soundtrack.<br /><br />Hans Zimmer is quite the composer, especially when it comes to his newest musical creation for this week's new Superman film, The Man of Steel (TMOS).<br /><br />Where his soundtracks for The Dark Knight series were very brooding, functional, and tactile in nature, much like the Bat-suit, TMOS's soundtrack evokes a very ethereal mood from the listener while at the same time making them feel powerful as if they are ready to blast off into the sky.<br /><br />To that end, when it comes to showcasing the full character of Superman, TMOS retains some of the brooding nature found within The Dark Knight series, as this film is a decidedly more realistic take, bare with me, than its predecessors.<br /><br />One way Zimmer drives home this more modern sound is through a symphony of drums, yes, you read that correctly. The most prominent instrument featured in the promotional music has been a drum that signals the impending choice that Clark must make to fully embrace his dual identity as a human as well as a demi-god here on Earth.<br /><br />Zimmer gathered some of the best drummers from the music industry to craft an aurally bombastic score that is a super sonic at times, and subdued just as fast when the music shifts to more somber stretches.<br /><br />A big theme in this new film is Clarks battle to choose whether or not to choose his inevitable destiny. That said, which choice he makes is subtly hinted at and teased throughout the soundtracks run time, but if the final track is any indicator, Superman truly does soar to life via this new musical imaging of the iconic characters theme song as the drums roar out their final notes.<br /><br />I am typing this from my iPhone, so I will save further comments for later. In closing, TMOS manages to meld the brilliant scope of Sci-Fi epics, a sense of Americana, and a reverence for the most iconic hero of all time into a soundtrack that fully embraces the rich legacythat has come before it. This is why I highly recommend a listen of this soundtrack before the films release this Friday.<br /><br />Enjoy.
1451697686|5.0|I think this is a brilliant book! I never feel like Bea is preaching or suggesting that everyone follow her lifestyle to the letter, but that she is just sharing all the techniques she has discovered over many years of exploration. How you implement her ideas is up to you.<br />After listening to the audiobook of &#34;The Story of Stuff&#34; I was looking for practical ideas to cut back on my disposables, and Zero Waste Home is full of ideas and recipes. As a visual artist, I appreciate Bea's focus on creativity as well. Thanks to some articles on her blog I was inspired to give away all the supplies I haven't used in years, and it has indeed freed me up and supercharged my creative spirit. I look forward to experimenting with her watercolor recipes and brainstorming other ways to save on waste! No artist wants to feel like they are just creating more &#34;stuff&#34; to be shuffled around this already full world.<br /><br />And for people who feel embarrassed to bring a pillowcase (which is just a large bag) to the store or compost their tampons, perhaps you could take a second and think about other cultures besides America where people do things differently and are totally fine and healthy? Many countries use cloth bags to carry food. Bodily fluids are natural and we don't have to be scared of them.
B008B68IUY|5.0|There is enough room in the car for four dolls: two in the car, two on top of the trunk area. It even includes seatbelts that kids can use to strap the dolls in. The trunk opens and can be used as a storage area. As a mom, I like that the seating area in the car is open so if something small gets in there, it's easy to get out. The car is sturdy and stands up well to daily use.

B0036MDNN0|5.0|Unique looking and gorgeous details.  The antler-like horns have not fallen off even with very rough play every day for weeks.<br /><br />Hefty and substantial piece of the highest collector quality you would expect of Papo! My son loves it and I am even a Papo addict now too!<br /><br />It is on the smaller side this one, much smaller than the Triceratops so be sure to check dimensions.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Wow. This CD is good. This CD is really really good. Classic Sabbath sound, melodic at times - bluesy at times... and always heavy. You know how some albums take a couple of listens to grow on you?? Not this one. Not for me. I was hooked immediately. Excellent recording and great mix. Ozzy's voice sounds unbelievably good, and the other guys sound great as well. Being a classic Sabbath fan, I too wish that Bill Ward was on the drums. For whatever reason, they couldn't work it out and that's too bad. That being said, the drummer for this CD does sound really good - and I'm not going to protest and miss out on a great album. I'd put it right up there with their old stuff. Yeah, it's that good. Definitely exceeded my expectations. This CD just begs to be played loud. I had to crank it until the walls shook and I could feel it. Hats off to Sabbath - this album rocks!
B000GKW4HG|5.0|Gorgeous... amazing detail...hefty substantial piece of the highest collector quality! My son loves it and I am even a Papo addict now too!

B008Y7N7JW|2.0|The story line was interesting but the video quality was very poor in the beginning.  Definitely not high def.  Picture quality slightly improved as the movie progressed.
B004JQN4WM|5.0|Just a beautiful ankylosaurus.  I am a Papo addict now!  Very durable...my toddler old son plays with his Papo dinosaurs pretty roughly every day and they are still in pretty much top notch condition, no parts have fallen off etc. They are collector top quality and I have to admit even as an adult I love looking at them and playing with them with my son.
B008K5T5AI|5.0|Ian Banks' Culture novels are all good--basically different slices of events from different times/races/places showing how the Culture (a loose confederation of advanced humanoids who are vaguely aligned) intervene in events around the galaxy to nudge things in a positive direction.  The joy of the Culture novels is that they aren't a series--you can read them in any order since the stories and characters are all different--but the central ideas/details are the same.<br /><br />This books is especially timely since it deals with the Subliming of a whole civilisation (essentially, everyone simultaneously moves to a higher, better, dimension).  So, it deals with issues of finality, end, death(?) and how different people deal with that knowledge.  Given the author's recent death, it is especially poignant.<br /><br />Personally, I think this is one of the best Culture novels he's written.  I'm just sorry there aren't more to come.
140123755X|5.0|My husband and I have been watching Once Upon a Time and I thought this would be the perfect gift for him.  He loved the writing and the way the fairy tale stories weaved together!
B002RI9UBS|1.0|It's very very rare I don't finish what I've started, well book wise anyway!<br />I found this very difficult to get into - well I failed to get into it at all.<br />I avoided it and read other things and dreaded going back to it - so have decided to see if others felt the same. Having read the other 1* reviews here I'm going to leave it. Some things aren't for me. That's all.
B004C3DLJS|5.0|Renting this movie was quick and easy! I would recommend instant watch to anyone. The movie is super funny and entertaining.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Although the series isn't finished, which is what I expected, I am soooooo happy it will continue. I love Gideon and Eva and hope they end up living happily ever after. I have read similar books but the Crossfire series is my favorite.  Sylvia Day is right on the mark and I love the passion in both of the lead characters. Can't wait for the next book and see how their lives continue.  Great job Sylvia, looking forward to many more of your books! Thank you!
0061537934|2.0|The Art of Race Car Driving In The Rain was a huge disappointment. It reminded me of perhaps 3 college Creative Writing Class assignments melded together. Each may have been earned the student an \\"A\\" but then I am saying a college Creative Writing Class...and not an advanced one. The dog reincarnation idea-cute, but I have read other books with, \\"what the dog is thinking\\" sections, and they were done much better. Dying wife and evil-in-laws? Hardly an original idea. Framed for sexual abuse by a horny teen. I won't even comment on that. The driving a race car in the rain metaphor...Ok, nice but beaten to death. Those who gave this book 5 stars-I can give you some really good recommendations to expand your appreciation of good writing.
B00BSBUZT6|4.0|This was a great story that is a must see for all eagles fans. The disc one is totally captivating. The disc 2 is really good to see so you understand what happened in the eagles return together. The only disappointment I had was the live concert disc that came with the story. All the video on it was great but I feel like their should have been more songs. What I mean is, it wasn't a complete concert from start to finish.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|What an amazing twist to the end of the book. I loved that Katniss ended up with Peeta. I would read a book about how their children were raised!
B009NY43NY|5.0|I have always like Sookie  Stackhouse books. That's why I also like true blood. Hope there will be more to come.
0142424277|5.0|Roald Dahl is a British novelist who wrote children's books. One of the last books Roald Dahl wrote was Matilda, which broke all previous records for a work of children's fiction with United Kingdom sales of over half a million paperbacks in six months (RoaldDahl.com). Roald's writing career started by making up bedtime stories to tell his children Olivia and Tessa (RoaldDahl.com). Even as he aged, Roald Dahl's books continued to be thrilling and intriguing for young readers to enjoy.<br /><br />In all of Roald Dahl's books, he used unique writing styles to attract the reader. He used twists and turns in his writing to add suspense to keep the reader's attention. Roald used many adjectives to describe the characters in a more detailed way. This made his novels more attractive to young children.<br /><br />Matilda Wormwood is the main character in the book. She is an extraordinary girl with a special power. The power she has is called telekinesis, which allows someone to move an object with brain power. Before Matilda starts school, her speech is perfect and she knows more words than most adults. She also teaches herself to read and devours many books from the public library.<br /><br />Matilda interacts with many different characters in the book. Her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Wormwood, see her as \\"nothing more than a scab.\\"  They believe that young girls \\"should be seen and not heard.\\" Matilda has a brother named Michael who is a normal boy, unlike Matilda.  At the age of five, Matilda begins school at Crunchem Hall Primary School. This is where Matilda meets most of the characters in the book such as Miss Honey and Ms. Trunchbull.  Ms. Trunchbull is the headmistress of the school. She is abusive to the children and her \\"idea of a perfect school is one in which there are no children at all\\".  Miss Honey is Matilda's classroom teacher. She is very sweet and kind to the children.<br /><br />Matilda is one of Roald Dahl's most outstanding books that I have read. Children,whom have not yet read this book, should because it is very interesting and entertaining. I would recommend Matilda to children ages 7-and up. Although it was written for young readers, adults would enjoy this book too.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|We like James Bond and this kept up with the standards.  No cursing and blood and quts.  We both liked it
B00BN3EE1O|5.0|Another great book, by Nicklos sparks, loved his books. Have read all of them, like the mystery in this one
B006VFLIYK|5.0|David Baldacci never seems to run out of twisted plots! I have so much work to do but couldn't put this book down until I got to the ending. I will not spoil any of it for you, but I highly recommend you buy this book and go someplace where no one can bother you until the end!
B000FBJFSC|4.0|Amazing what the human spirit can endure.  McCourt has a way of writing that makes the reader feel that he/she knows the McCourt family personally. I am anxious to read &#34; 'Tis&#34; to find out how Frank's life plays out in America.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|these gm is great I like the pvp stuff on here .... every one should get this you'll fall in love wit it keep the gm going I'm rey for svz3
B00CHNKJFO|4.0|This App is the the first pinball app with a great theme It is worth it but I really really think it is a bad price.
B005AKFXZW|5.0|I started reading this book as part of my book club and although I didn't finish it within the prescribed time, I kept reading this wonderful and magical story. It is quite unlike anything I have read before and the story line surprised me with its originality. Erin has a wonderful imagination. If you want a story that transports you entirely to another version of our world, choose this book! Wonderful!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Use it everyday, excellent! I have tried others but for me the weather channel is the most accurate and useful. One of my must have apps!
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|It's quite entertaining and interesting.  I did NOT have time to finish watching it, but I need to watch it again to really understand what's going on.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Excellent if you want detailed graphic display of your battery power. It is a well thought out App if you need to keep an eye on your power
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|It was a nice movie made me questioning of my self and what I was in the past, or is there any evidence of that?
1781162646|5.0|This was his best book, the characters came to life.  Some of his fans may be disappointed that the book isn't as action driven as his other books. I see it as the natural result of maturity.  When I was a teenager I read his early books, but then I matured away from his style.  Now we meet again.  I hope he writes more in this genre.
B00CKZX0AA|1.0|I liked Superman Returns more than most.  Even if you didn't care for the film, the one thing you probably could respect is the revival of the John Williams' original theme.  That theme has been synonymous with Superman for 30+ years now, and there's no way of getting around that.<br /><br />With that said, I understand the film was a reboot and to re-use the theme, again, within 7 years of another reboot might have been pushing it.  Thus, I was fine with a new score...until I heard this turd of a tune Zimmer pinched out.<br /><br />I wonder if it's possible to plagiarize from one's own body of work, because if so, Zimmer needs to sue himself.  As others have noted, this soundtrack, while remarkably putrid, will make you recall his recent catalog of previous soundtracks because, well, that's what this is composed of.  As soon as I heard the clips, all the Batman films came rushing in.  Then, Inception jumped into the frame.  There's not tune to these tracks (nothing to hum or whistle), they are extremely basic, and the actual tonal layering is quite derivative.<br /><br />There's no doubt Zimmer phoned this one in, especially considering it was done within the last, say, 10 months (wasn't available for the original teaser trailer from last summer).  Just nothing audibly pleasing to be found here.  \\"What Are You Going To Do...\\" is about the only worthwhile track to download here, as it's the best piece of the bunch (probably why it's the only one that's been heavily featured in trailers and TV spots).  Even then, wasting money on the one song isn't even really worth it for a track that probably won't even get 5 spins before boredom sets in.
B002MG2ATY|4.0|Was entertained by the film, found it a bit long, so watched in two sittings. Have read much on the subject and wished there had not been artistic license used, (composite characters mostly). Most Americans probably view the events of Nov., 1963 in the same light as the Civil War. Ancient history
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|A very intriguing and fast read.  We've all heard about the repressiveness of North Korean but that they have prisons where whole families are condemned to is amazing.  The author did a great job interjecting Chinese and South Korean cultural attitudes into the story too.  Overall, a very compelling story about a contemporary subject.
0425252868|5.0|This is a very well written book and it's hard to put down once you start it. My father was a pilot in this group so I've read extensively on B17's. It's very accurate, well researched and I learned plenty of new things. It's so much more than a book about their incredible encounter in the sky. You will learn plenty about what it was like to fly in the Luftwaffe and fight for a cause that many did not believe in. You will also learn about the incredibly tough conditions that the men of the 8th Air Force had to endure ranging from -70 degree temperatures, flak, fighters and mid air collisions while forming up in the dark, fog shrouded skies over England. A great gift for a history buff or someone who wants to learn about this aspect of WW II. Hopefully it will be made into a movie someday.
B00AAZOKS8|1.0|Bogus! This book is interactive with audio and picture movement when purchased on the NOOK. I don't know if we are doing something wrong but me and my child are upset that the book is doing none of the effects displayed on the other system.
0988178532|4.0|Outview is a fast-paced, well-conceived science fiction novel, with engaging characters and an interesting premise.  Well-written for the most part, it does come across sometimes as more of a teen-targeted story; overall, though, Legg has created an interesting and troubling universe that draws the reader in and keeps them actively engaged in a great plot and storyline.
1616960922|4.0|I thought the ending was too predictable, but it was still an enjoyable book. Not Sanderson's best, but a nice short read if you want an introduction to his writing or just want to read everything he writes because you are a fanboy/fangirl. I think the price is too high for paperback that takes only one day to read.
B005S9EK5Y|1.0|Could something be wrong with the DVD?  About halfway through I began to hear extra noises along with the audio, like the dvd was tracking incorrectly.  Then it stopped.  Help!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I saw the first movie and can't wait for the second. I REALLY loved it. I can't believe the end!
B009AP2G26|2.0|I still watch this show in spite of myself, but it's really gone downhill. It's been a mixed-bag, quality-wise, for me since Episode one, but it's always been compelling enough to keep watching. Good things about this season: the transition to following the graduates has been handled well (especially the NYC crew), and the general lack of focus on the teachers has been welcome. The downsides: more awkward very-special social-commentary episodes, and the less said about the bland new additions, the better. It's biggest crime, however, has been the lack of great musical numbers. No matter how bad episodes were in past years, I could always count on at least one song per episode that I wanted to immediately rewind and watch again, but those have been few and far between this season. And when you get rid of the best part of an already-uneven show, not much is left. Here's hoping that it only makes it one more season, as i can't take much more of this.
B001D0DQUC|5.0|Ferris Bueller's Day Off is a classic and one of my favorite movies ever. Over twenty-five years later and this is still a movie you can watch over and over again and love it every time!
B009B0CZXU|5.0|This mesmerizing album kind fo came and went last fall without much attention (Cat Power put out a similar release around the same time, which might have pushed this out of the limelight--that disc is good, too), but I keep coming back to it. Her first album never really came together for me, but I can't get enough of this. It genre-hops bit, a splitting the difference between freak-folk and mellow synth-pop, but works as a whole. For me, the improvement over the first album is a stronger melodic sense.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|The missions keep getting better and the new characters and further development of the plot line are all excellent.  Even the slow missions develop the story and keep you interested for more.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|COol design and a lot of fun.  I'm very pleased that i grabbed this on the day it was free, but I also would say it's worth the full price.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great concept no real need to spend real money. Great daily challenges. overall just a great game. Couldn't be happier
0399157565|3.0|The Bone Bed  by Patricia Cornwell<br /><br />It has been a while since I read a Scarpetta novel so it took me several chapters to get up to speed on the characters. This was a bit more convoluted than I remember. The red herring was enough to fool me. I was rooting for the wrong \\"bad guy\\" for most of the book. I'm still not sure I know who the bad guy was - do I remember him at all???? A good mystery.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|AWESOME!!!!!!! I think it the best game and its free! so all I have to is: get this game. and........... hope you like it!
0316223239|5.0|What if...<br />Your entire world was a single room.<br />The only other people in that world are MA and Old Nick. Old Nick is Scary. Ma is Love.<br />You are dependent on Old Nick for Food and sometimes he forgets.<br />Outside is scary. Scarier than Old Nick. Maybe it is real. Maybe it is like TV - pretend.<br />What if you have never been OUTSIDE ....or touched Grass...or felt Sunshine.....or felt Wind....or talked to anyone except MA.<br />What if MA wants you to go Outside. What if Ma wants you to talk to People. What if Ma wants you to Get Help..........by yourself. And you are only five.<br />ROOM by Emma Donaghue tells the heartbreaking, but tender story of that young boy and Ma and Old Nick from the viewpoint of Jack who has lived his entire life in ROOM.  Reminiscent of the real life story of Jaycee Dugard, who was held captive and gave birth to two daughters during 18 years, ROOM shows how a young mother creates a world in a single room, creates that world for her young son and then pushes him out into OUTSIDE to try to save both of them.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|It was fanomal.<br /><br />I saw it in NYC and Philadelphia on stage. This movie hit it right on the nail.
B007L96VCY|5.0|I recently bought three of Paul McCartney's albums: Ram, Band on the Run, and Venus and Mars.  I bought them on vinyl years ago when they came out, but had not listened to them in a long, long time.  All three are good albums, and I probably agree with the general consensus that Band on the Run is McCartney's best album, but somewhat surprisingly, I've been enjoying Ram the most since I bought them.  It's just a very likeable, enjoyable album.  I like the way it celebrates home and love and the country, and I like its humor.  I've got to tell you that it was interesting looking at the lyrics, which came with the CD; there are quite a few places that I've been misunderstanding all these years...<br />p.s. The second disc in the \\"Special Edition\\" is also not bad.  I had completely forgotten about Another Day, which I always liked.  And some of the other songs are not bad as well, especially Hey Diddle.
B0011MZOEI|5.0|Action, Action, Action.  The Die Hard's are always great fun and this one is no different.  The plot is interesting but does not slow the action down.  Bruce Willis delivers.  He's tough, sexy, and cute.  Oh yeah, he can be all that and more. Timothy Olyphant is a GREAT bad guy.  If you've never seen the Die Hards you're missing out.  If you are house bound for a weekend or just ready to stay in with your sweetie or friends, rent them all.  A Die Hard marathon is a good way to have a boatload of fun.  The only thing you have to do is make sure your tongue is planted snugly in your cheek, jot down your favorite lines, keep count of the crashes (if you can), and, of course, you have to keep track of the body count.  At the end of the movie compare notes.  If you've seen 'em all, you'll have just as much fun the first, second, third, fourth... however many times.  If you've seen 'em a few dozen times, create a questionnaire for each movie that everyone has to answer before you watch it.  Then go over the questionnaire after and award funny, cheap prizes.  It's so fun to see how many you can get right, how many things you add that actually happened in a different Die Hard movie or even a completely different action movie like an Arnold or Rambo.  You will have a blast!<br /><br />And, yes, you can include trick questions if you want, for example, In which Die Hard move did the character, John McClane, say, &#34;You shouldn't drink and bake.&#34;  Answer:  None.  That's a line from an Arnold movie.  Give extra points to the first person who says which Arnold movie, the year, and the actor to whom he delivered the line.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|How best to capture the horrors of a police state that is North Korea?  This novel does a good job of portraying a range of experiences, too few of them pleasant, of life under a communist dictatorship.  The medium of fiction is perhaps more engaging than a factual recitation of testimony from defectors as it allows the characters to reveal their motives and attitudes towards the unreality of a society too brutalized to rise up against it en mass.  I can't claim to be an expert or even a student of the Koreas, though I have decent knowledge of the ills of other Stalinist states and find this rendering most compelling.  Reading it right before bed-time is not always, however, a good choice.
B000SLP4SE|4.0|It has Mark Wahlberg in it...there's no need to say more.  If you like Mark Wahlberg movies, you'll love this.
0385344228|3.0|Boring beginning and middle<br />I almost quit reading this book several times, only the glowing reviews kept me going. The first 3/4 of the book had me wondering why anyone would think this whiney, self-serving and self deluded man would be a good ADA. Jacob and Laurie were simply afterthoughts. Only the last 1/4 was interesting and by that time I knew what the ending would be. If you really, really like psycho babble and navel gazing you might like this book, otherwise skip it.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Everything one would expect from an explorer type application.  Simple and straightforward user interface.  Sweet.<br /><br />Would recommend to anyone with an Android OS device.
1118490371|5.0|This book is very easy to understand ... I am about a 1/3 of the way through. I wanted a book for beginners, so this worked. I plan to get another book that is more advanced when I am finished with this one so I can continue to learn.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Different sort of lawyer story<br />Worth the time although not a real page turner<br />I would recommend for different experiences
B004W1GCNC|4.0|Interest in Downton Abbey brought us to Upstairs Downstairs. We're looking forward to viewing the second season as we've become interested in the characters.
B00COHIFQS|3.0|I was hoping this movie would be better. It's not as scary/creepy as i thought it would be. It was ok.
0385535147|4.0|THE RACKETEER  by John Grisham<br /><br />This vintage Grisham mystery will appeal to fans and new readers as well.  The Racketeer is the tale of an innocent (and now former) lawyer who is out to redeem himself by squealing on a murderer and thief.  The main character, Malcolm Bannister, posits a scheme to the FBI to gain his exoneration and freedom by giving them the name and motive for the torture and murder of a federal judge and the woman with him.<br />You will enjoy the twists and turns of the plot as Malcolm enters the Witness Protection system and gradually gives the feds what they want.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Being from the Boston area, I liked the local setting.  Great book especially if you really like surprise endings. Didn't love it, but liked it a lot.
B00CBKVGGY|3.0|I rated this higher than most reviewers I've seen--the plotline could have been better, but watching old Los Angeles was a treat for my eyes.
B004L3AQLU|4.0|My father was in the medical business and I know many people that have been in the medical sale business. This is pretty much right one with how people are hired to be sales people. Anne Hathaway is very beautiful and is very much so here.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|If you have this headset... which is the best I have ever used (and I have struggled through many).... this is the case to have!!!  it should be part of the purchase from Plantronics along with the headset!
B005M5PENG|5.0|I like how every episode has a new thrill and they complete the entire story in one episode without leaving you on edge to see what happens next on the next episode.  All the actors in this show are good looking; so even more reason to watch it!
030758836X|3.0|From the moment Nick announces he has lied 10 times, you will wonder! When did he lie? Is he telling you a lie now? Is Amy telling the truth? Is Amy really dead? Has she been kidnapped? By whom? Who is the \\"bad guy? Amy? Nick? Go? Maribeth and Rand? Anyone of a several other characters? Is there a \\"good guy?\\"<br />Well written and entirely plausible, Gone Girl will keep you guessing to the end.  Book groups will find a wealth of topics for discussion - family, siblings, lawyers, divorce, murder, friendship, mental health, marriage, fame, wealth - among others.<br />Mystery fans and those who prefer love stories or family dramas will find something to love in this psychological mystery.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Very well written. Excellent acting by all cast members. Maggi Smith is awesome!<br />Attention to detail is evidently displayed in the period costumes, sets and props.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I had to replace my Micro USB cable for my kindle. The original just flaked apart.  One day it's fine and the next it looked like a rat was trying to eat it for lunch.  This one seems much stronger, but time will tell.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|I recently ordered this movie for my 4-year old son and he loves it. He has watched this movie every day since we received it in the mail. I highly recommend this for young children, they will love it as well. Great movie!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|works great, couldn't ask for anymore, has large buttons so it is easy to use and it is easy to read
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This was a replacement for the original charger and it works great!!  I wouldn't trade it for one of those cheap ones from Walmart in a million years.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I NEVER write reviews but I value them highly when choosing a book to read. I was completely disappointed in this book. The ending if you want to call it a ending was terrible. Totally dragging out the series. Also felt like she was stealing lines and ideas from the Fifty Shades books. Wonder how long she will make us wait for the next 2 books. Uggghhhhhhh
B004NELBPC|5.0|I can always read and stay updated on the news anywhere I go on the kindle.<br />Will spread the word
B005S9EJ14|5.0|The characters are delightful, the story is pleasant and it is just a fun movie to watch.<br />So glad I bought it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great graphics, great puzzles, hints didn't give too much away and clues were well placed.  Loved it! Just wish that it kept going....
B00BQ1DATU|3.0|I love Junip and just saw them for the third time a few weeks ago.  A fine live act.  This recording is disappointing and I've only listened a few times; I see no new directions from the great first album either lyrically or instrumentally.  Just a lot of the same.
B0064JV4LU|5.0|Not what I expected, a total smile!  it will have you laughing and even shedding a tear.  only the French, a truly beautiful movie! enjoy!<br />guys, close to a chick flick but not, note it will work as one in your favor!!!
B00AEBB8XS|5.0|I watched this movie when it first came out and it has been a classic movie of my era, a good addition to my collection.
0061733199|5.0|It is relatively cheap..but It's great full of useful info. *GREAT* color illustrations. It is almost encyclopedia for survival skill
B00BSWMITK|5.0|You either love Joe or not. This album is more of Joe's brilliant songs, similar to a lot of his other stuff, but his other stuff is really good, so what's the problem. There are a couple of stand out tunes, some really brilliant drumming, and the &#34;usual&#34; great guitar solos and tone to die for. If you like Joe, you will most likely dig this cd.
B00AZMFK3K|1.0|Just a thought here, but I for one am tired of seeing unreleased CD's and movies get a flood of bland and verbose reviews when no one, not one of these folks has seen the packaging, special features, or quality of the transfers.<br /><br />Moreover, I am sick and tired of seeing the longest reviews, those with single line, line-by-line summaries of the tracks/episodes/chapters that take up half a page or more, more or less forcing people to click the \\"yes\\" button when asked \\"Was this review helpful\\"?  These are reviews, not friggin post-modern novellas people!<br /><br />So, just for fun, let's see how many people will see this, and like this, so we can send a message to Amazon to perhaps get them to:<br /><br />1.  lockout product reviews until the product has actually shipped? And,<br />2.  limit the reviews to something reasonable.  Honestly, in the age of ADHD/zero-attention-span teens and 24/7 multitasking in the workplace if you can't do a serviceable product review in less than 1000 words, 1200 tops, your opinions probably don't matter.  Shakespeare famously quipped, \\"brevity is the soul of wit\\".  If so, then 90% of the reviewers on Amazon are self-defined half-wits by dint of their submissions.<br /><br />This is not the final refuge for flunkies who fail to write the last great American novel.  People wanna know if it's good and worth the money.  End of story.<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />PS, because Amazon reviews must contain 20 words about the product, here it goes:<br /><br />\\"This BluRay has not been released yet.  The movie was pretty good.  I'll review the disc when they finally release it.\\"
B00AEFYSEA|5.0|&#34;Once Upon a Time In The West&#34; another masterpiece Sergio Leone's film. Special collector's edition also includes special feature commentary. Henry Fonda stars in his most sinster role as a hired killer who ruthlessly slays an entire family. Jason Robards plays an infamous bandit framed for the slaughter. Charles Bronson is a mysterious loner determined to exact vengeance for a grudge he refuses to devulge and the beautiful Claudia Cardinale. I consider this among the greatest westerns. Awesome soundtrack. Highly recommend.
B0050PYNO4|4.0|Paul, the irreverent alien!<br />I wish I knew him ...<br />10 more words, a must see movie.  be warned, the first 20 mins is difficult, but wait until Paul shows up.  well worth the wait!
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|This was a decent movie, but given the strong cast, I felt it lacked punch. Clever and devious female characters!!
B005HED11Y|4.0|One of my favors, it was clear hd I have no complaints it buffs a little but still good I do enjoy watching amazon tv and with prime it's free at less fells that way
0375842209|5.0|Different viewpoint of Nazi Germany from a family and youth viewpoint by families not involved in Nazi war machine.  Well written.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Very thrilling read at some points, slower at other parts, the character's perspective is very well achieved. Good, fun read, but not a classic.
B0009QBLA8|5.0|Horror or exercise in film noir? I don't know, but David Lynch goes where no one has gone before.  It wasn't clear to me this was a Korean Import, but that really was of no consequence.  I doubt I could have gotten an American version for such a cheap price and the quality was excellent.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|phenomenal movie with a great message, actually several great messages with a coherent storyline, outrageous bad guy, great science.., it even took my dad by surprise!  enjoy!
B00847KFDS|4.0|John Fogerty proves there is nothing wrong with '[writing]...a song for everyone' on his collaborative 2013 effort, [[ASIN:B00847KFDS Wrote a Song For Everyone]].  Mostly an album in which he covers himself,  Fogerty does manage to introduce the world to two new numbers in \\"Mystic Highway\\" and \\"Train of Fools\\".  Old or new is besides the point; Fogerty delivers a compelling effort.  If nothing else, Wrote a Song For Everyone makes Fogerty/classic rock lovers everywhere remember why they love both of those things.<br /><br />On \\"Fortune Songs\\", Fogerty is joined by Foo Fighters, with frontman Dave Grohl infusing plenty of energy into his guest vocals with Fogerty. Keith Urban provides a smoother vocal contrast to the grittier Fogerty on \\"Almost Saturday Night\\". More lightweight he may be vocally, Urban brings it on banjo and guitar. Both opening cuts are solid performances, but are upstaged; the best cuts proceed afterwards. \\"Lodi\\", a collaboration with Fogerty's sons on guitar is simply superb, with the Creedence Clearwater Revival vet sounding as solid as ever.  After sharp original \\"Mystic Highway\\", Miranda Lambert develops a fine vocal chemistry with Fogerty on a countrified treatment of \\"Wrote of A Song for Everyone\\".  The cherry on top? Tom Morello's guitar solo (and 'chops' in general).  Zac Brown Band help make \\"Bad Moon Rising\\", a favorite, sound as triumphant as ever.  If the album ended there, it would be a success.<br /><br />The rest of the album has overall good, if sometimes mixed moments.  \\"Long As I Can See The Light\\" matches Fogerty and Jim James of My Morning Jacket.  With two different qualities of voices, Fogerty's grit contrasts and somewhat outperforms the smoothness of James' pipes.  Kid Rock has the opposite problem of Jim James, perhaps overindulging a bit on \\"Born on the Bayou\\", courtesy of Creedence Clearwater Revival's '69 effort [[ASIN:B001AKTZO6 Bayou Country]].  \\"Train of Fools\\", the second of two originals, is effective, if less enthralling than the earlier \\"Mystic Highway\\".  \\"Someday Never Comes\\", featuring Dawes, again featuring two  contrasting vocals that aren't a perfect match. Bob Seger works better as far as the 'size' and 'rock-grit' of his voice, but \\"Who'll Stop This Train\\" couldn't be referred to as being the 'cream of the crop'.  \\"Hot Rod Heart\\" is better, featuring both the vocal and guitar skills of Brad Paisley.  His country colleague, the veteran voiced Alan Jackson guests on \\"Have You Ever Seen the Rain\\", but the results are a bit disappointing.  Jennifer Hudson commands on a Creole-styled version of \\"Proud Mary\\", which also features Allen Toussaint and the Rebirth Brass Band.  What better way to end than one of the world's most beloved classics?<br /><br />It is easy to overrate a veteran like John Fogerty out of respect for his  contributions to rock and roll (and they are untouchable).  [[ASIN:B00847KFDS Wrote a Song For Everyone]] is not a 'classic' itself per se, but it is ultimately a fine showcase and excellent reminder of how many great songs Fogerty has written and performed, both with CCR and as a solo artist.  The excellence easily outweighs the quibbles and nitpicks here.  3 ½ stars.alling than the earlier \\"Mystic Highway\\".  \\"Someday Never Comes\\", featuring Dawes, again featuring two  contrasting vocals that aren't a perfect match.

B00C7KYXHW|4.0|I do not recommend for young viewers or those with squeamish stomachs.<br />Very dark story line.  The carnage borders on the ridiculous at times.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Working very.well solving the problem recharging. Now I'm. More flexible can charge in car or anywhere with USB connection easy connect to computer
B0026IUXME|5.0|Disturbing but true depiction of Holocust-needed to be reminded of so not to repeat. Can we still be challenged to live well? Beautiful soundtrack.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Originally when I tried swift key on my Bionic I hated it. It was too memory at intensive and when running any apps it would delay. Since upgrading to an S4 that no longer be problem, so now &quot;best keyboard app&quot;
B004UHL9EK|4.0|Handy little timer. Versital and works well. No problems with operation on tablet or phone.I tried the free app then purchased the pro. One of my apps that gets daily use.
B006UKC566|4.0|Great Movie, good looking 3D effects as well. This is a movie that would definitely fall into your best of DVD category.
B005OP7162|5.0|Watched all episodes of Season 1 and 2 in a few days.  Loved the intrigue and the many plot twists and turns.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I wasn't sure who committed the crime.  I wasn't sure what the parents felt -- even though this was the heart of the story.  The changing emotions of the parents was so wonderfully explored by the author.  I am considering on of William Landay's other books.
B008JGSM6G|2.0|Have this loaded on my Android phone and it works wonderfully!  However, I don't want my kid playing on my phone all the time, so I installed it on our tablet - and it doesn't work.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|Basic love story was good...Good use of conflict in book, but could have omitted some of the naughty scenes.... T.M.I.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I loved being able to catch up on this series by using my prime Amazon membership. I will be watching more episodes
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Singh nails it with this one. I was worried that the secrecy and buildup would overshadow the book. But it doesn't. From a technical standpoint there weren't any obvious plot loopholes that took me out of the book. While there may have been one or two, I missed them ENTIRELY. Honestly, I expected to find some, but Singh obviously planned this series meticulously and it is paying dividends for the reader now. I paid Penguin's outrageous Kindle price, but I don't even mind. In short - I would give it 6 stars if I could.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Really enjoyed the suspense in each episode.  Was not expecting ending to Season 1...will have to wait until next Season for resolution...ugh!
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Although I am apparently one of the few who like it best. Books are terrible. Watch the shows. Much better.
B00B2TUKI0|5.0|This, and Diane Schurr's &#34; Talkin Bout You &#34; are two of a kind. If you like jazz-blues full of feeling and great singing that will make you want to sway, slow dance, then make love, these cd's are for you.
B007IJEMAA|5.0|I personally enjoy this soundtrack because I am transported into back into the movie as well the intense emotions I had for it. Call it as you may, but when a movie is this good, I am bound to get the CD as well.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|I really like this game it brings gameplay to a whole new level. My only problem is that the loading screen always freezes and I never get the daily mission.
B00B5AP7NY|5.0|4.5 out of 5<br /><br />It's time for the Man of the Year Awards in Gotham City. The contenders? Bruce Wayne and Lex Luthor. The winner? Well, you guessed it: Bruce Wayne. When the Joker crashes the party, Lex sees a potential ally in his fight against not only Superman, but all superheroes. They forge an uneasy alliance and Lex uses Joker's expertise in chemistry to create not only a gas that would make everyone vote for him in the upcoming Presidential election, but also Kryptonite. In exchange, Lex would provide Joker with a special brick dismantling device that is able to take apart shiny black objects, something Joker's all too familiar with thanks to the Dark Knight.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Batman and Robin have their hands full with an outbreak from Arkham Asylum. Superman shows up to help and eventually the Dynamic Duo and the Man of Steel discover Lex's and Joker's partnership. However, team ups aren't Batman's strong suit but after a little coaxing from Robin, he learns that sometimes you need outside help to come to victory.<br /><br />Just when Batman and Superman think they've got Joker and Lex right where they want them, the sinister duo unleash a powerful force that will take the entire Justice League of America to stop.<br /><br />If you've played LEGO Batman 2, then you're familiar with this story. This movie even uses clips from the game, but then fills in the gaps with fresh animation. So while it's kind of a rehash, it's a well-done rehash and, hey, it's LEGO. LEGO animated movies are few and far between and I hope LEGO Batman: The Movie - DC Superheroes Unite is the first in a move to bring more and more brick superheroes to the small screen. Perhaps even to the big one one day.<br /><br />The animation is crisp, flawless, and well-thought out. The graphics are amazing and convey a plausible world made of LEGO, every detail somehow made from LEGO bricks. No small feat from a design standpoint, creating something to believable yet so . . . LEGO-y.<br /><br />With a solid story filled with the right amount of action and humor, I'm glad I added LEGO Batman: The Movie to my superhero movie collection. Besides, the exclusive Clark-Kent-changing-into-Superman LEGO figure that comes with it is not too shabby either. Glad to have him as part of my Superman figure collection.<br /><br />LEGO Batman: The Movie - DC Superheroes Unite is recommended for all ages. I loved watching it with my kids and I know you will, too. And if you don't have kids, then it's still worth checking out. Again, LEGO? Batman? Superman? DC superheroes? Yes, please!br /><br />With a solid story filled with the right amount of action and humor, I'm glad I added LEGO Batman: The Movie to my superhero movie collection.

1439153663|4.0|It was somewhat hard read......there were some really mean angry characters....the times were most difficult for people back then with treatment of blacks, medical issues,etc. I think I would recommend.......our book club enjoyed it.
031606792X|3.0|Let's just say that I got hooked in, read them all quickly, read them a second time and then realized how poorly written they actually were, the fourth being the slowest read. Not much action, and a lot of trying to not only push the book but tying up loose ends.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|and its a bit painful... a little too realistic for comfort.  But you have to endure the few painful episodes to graduate to the point of appreciating what is an outstanding show.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Intense, but well done picture! And knowing it is a true story, heart wrenching throughout and then heartwarming at the end!
B008ALAHA4|5.0|Not much needs to be said.  It does exactly what it is designed to do and it does it flawlessly.  Any of my MagSafe power supplies work find with my MagSafe 2 MacBook Pro.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Love this funny romantic comedy. I bit different but loved the chemistry between the 2 main actors. I'm very pleased I rented it.
B008NMT684|5.0|My 3 year-old granddaughter is able to do these puzzles easily.  She enjoys piecing the vehicles together.  It is a good puzzled for toddlers.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|super fun game for kids and fans of any age. I would definitely recommend this game to every one who enjoys the show.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Just stop what you are doing and watch all 5 seasons of Breaking Bad, it as good television as there exists in this world.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game is so cool, I love the battle layout and u do not have to wait long for it stuff to be ready, so much to do and a lot of fun, get and u won't be disappointed.
B00C7JAAH0|4.0|I expected no less than that from Lady A. Once again, they've rocked it! Really appreciate all of the hard work & countless hours they put into their music.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|WAsn't what I expected but enjoyed it just the same. It was slow moving and a bit boring in the beginning but got more interesting as it went a long.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I have stayed up way to late the last several nights because I could not put this book down! The story is terrific the characters are likable and now that I am done I am certainly going to miss them.
B007QPFGJW|4.0|This is the second book I've read from Jo Nesbo... I naturally knew it would be a page turner and thiller.  The title threw me off as the book isn't really about a type of 'Phantom'... I suppose the killer could be translated as the Phanton.<br /><br />The story revolves around the death of Gusto, a local junkie and dealer that the cops don't care much for, but is (well was) friends with Harry's son before be was killed.  (And just when I had thought I had figured out the killer... I was WRONG AGAIN and the story twisted at the last minute!)<br /><br />Nesbo adopts an interesting point of view and gives us Gusto's dying thoughts, along with Harry's real-time investigation and interestingly I found Gusto's brutal narrative one of the more compelling aspects of the story.  Nesbo also skilfully dances around with the 3rd person perspective creating a dynamic narrative, where many authors would have only made a clumsy mess.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I'm not an original \\"Trekie\\" so I have no idea what this does compared to the old. What I do know is I enjoyed this movie immensely. I was on the edge of my seat, I laughed and laughed and I was choked up. I'm not going to break down the whole thing here, I am just going to say I think it was awesome. The actors played their parts awesome and I hope they hurry up with a 3rd movie!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John Green has done it! He has made me laugh, cry, and think deeply about the world all at the same time. The storyline, the plot, the characters, everything about this novel was pure genius. Thre is nothing not to love about Hazel Grace or Augustus Waters or our dear friend Isaac. This novel affected me so deeply that my horse is named Augustus(Gus for short) because of what a beautiful and wonderful character Augustus Waters is. John Green is most definately the greatest author  have had the pleasure of reading, and surpasses J. K. Rowling and other noted great authors by a landslide! If you have not read or enjoyed this book, there might be something wrong with you!
1609611543|4.0|I bought the book on the advice of my massage therapist.  While it contains many scientific explanations for the rationale of eliminating wheat from your diet and the problems that wheat causes, the writer also pretty much advocates a low carb diet eliminating or greatly reducing most grains including quinoa, oats, etc.  I have tried low-carb diets in the past and they are extremely hard to follow while maintaining a normal life.  I began by eliminating wheat from my diet and it really did help with the digestive issues I have had.  While not going on the low carb diet he recommends, I found the book very useful in eliminating wheat from my diet and I am more mindful of the carbs I'm ingesting.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|Incredibly realistic snow and woodland scenery. A very lush production with so much detail in every scene.<br /><br />Cute and fun
B003LSTK8G|5.0|Very interesting book especially if you have an interest in the financial crisis. I would only recommend if you are slightly financially literate but then again they're probably the only ones who would pickup a book such as this.
B0047747A6|5.0|If you're a Michael Jackson fan, you'll love this book!  If you aren't a fan of MJ, you'll still enjoy it! First of all; it's the only book ever written by Michael himself.  He has released a lot of memories (good and bad), also things that have happened to him over the course of his life and career.  Some parts were heart breaking and eye opening into not just the entertainer, but the PERSON he was.  I found some new things I didn't have a clue before, granted I was born in the \\"BAD\\" era and always had a slight love for his music and dancing, even though his early years and \\"OFF THE WALL\\" era were before I was even born.  He has written many personal stories on his life, career, family, faith, issues he had to overcome by himself; it's just an amazing read into a child star's life that grew into his adult life, in the music industry and growing up in the most famous family in the music business.  **I also bought this book in Hardcover and Kindle.. the pictures he inserted are lovely!
1451695195|2.0|read it for a book group.  Sounds like a bad drug trip to me.  I'd rather heaven be less dramatic!
B003XDXNOQ|5.0|I have had my old crocs for years, they don't have any tread left and the hole by the big toe has worn through on my black pair. I have 3 pair. Saw this style and ordered and was thrilled with the fit. Much slimmer and fit way better then the old style I had.  I couldn't believe the difference. I'm trying to get more colors, but 6 must be a popular size, so only have the black for now. I'll have to keep checking!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|this was a very intense novel, especially as a parent, and knowing what parents go through when their children turn into something they never thought would happen.  Interesting stuff about the &#34;bad gene&#34; theory
B0002YCVXI|5.0|Cannot stop listening to the entire CD. Hope he does more with Ennio Morricone's lovely music. So glad Pandora introduced me to this wonderful collaboration.
B008JFUO0Y|5.0|There's a lot of mixed reviews on this one... I'm a huge fan of the original movies, and... I really liked this movie a lot. There hasn't been a mainstream horror movie like this in awhile, it was a lot of fun. The 'fans' that bitched about this movie being made, need to bitch at Sam Raimi, Bruce Campbell, and Rob Tapert. Considering the movie probably wouldn't have been released if it wasn't for them.  A horror movie is a horror movie, and we should be entertained by them. Can't wait for Army of Darkness 2!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Such a good read-- the endless twists and turns and I couldn't guess what was coming next.  It was a great thriller and I recommend it HIGHLY!  The ending was a moment of \\"WHAT!?\\"  There were minimal parts of dragging on with legal strategy but it didn't take away from the meat/heart/story of the book.<br /><br />I normally read a book in a week- this book I couldn't put down and took me 2 days.  Such a good book!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I really like playing this game it is a nice way to unwind for me there are several ways to play this game you can do bingo or play slot machines and invite your friends to play along
B007MB5OCE|5.0|I loved this from beginning to end.  Came across this book quite by accident and loaded a sample on my Kindle and read it to my husband.  He wanted to know what eventually happened so purchased the book.  Hubby said it was a great story.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|The scenery and graphics were super. The last part of the movie went to artistic lengths that diluted the weak story down...even further. Worth the watch for the scenes and the CGI~
B003ZSJ212|4.0|Nice set of all the movies except the packaging.  The discs are in cardboard sleeves overtime the discs could get scratches.
B00319ECGK|5.0|Very good movie; it was fun to watch. Would highly recommend to anyone of all ages; exceeded my expectations. Thanks.
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|Once again, Jo Nesbo has created a page-turning thriller in The Snowman.  And, once again, his villian was not apparent, at least to me, until the end, with several likely suspects discarded as the ending drew near.<br />I LOVED it!  The thrill, mystery, twists and turns of this book kept me on edge and wanting more.  I've now officially become a regular reader of Nesbo now.. this is the first book I read from him and now want to read the rest of his books!
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|This was truly a great game until it got boring. There is nothing wrong with this game but it just got boring after a while.
B0091WD4ZQ|5.0|The words and interactions of this romantic couple flow so naturally that the viewer is immediately captured and carried along their story.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Really enjoy playing this. lots of fun and some hard play. but, for the most part not to hard to have fun with it!
0689877692|5.0|Pop-up books have come a long way wow! This book is a must if you have kids that are learning their numbers. It's fun to look at for any age really. You can't get this kind of experience from any electronics. Pick one up, it's cheap and fun to flip thru.
B002ZJSURY|4.0|This book is a very good comment on the rights of people in a teorrist culture. Rumpole as usual fights for the underdog in conjunction with the Oxford Book of English verse. A happy companion to anyone's reading Rumpole fights for justice again putting all pomposity into perspective.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Such a good read-- the twists and turns and I couldn't guess what was coming next.  It was a great thriller and I recommend it HIGHLY!  I can't wait to read the rest of Gillian Flynn's books.
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|Beautiful Creatures is true to the book and an awesome movie! Kind of a youth oriented movie but thoroughly enjoyed watching with my daughter. Definitely recommend!
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|Years after the first movie, viewers can recognize this couple as old friends that one is glad to meet again.  Again, the script is so naturally written that viewers eagerly follow their romantic reunion.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This was a very funny book. Refreshing to read from the guys perspective ( even if it does make you shake your head sometimes-sooo very accurate ) :)<br />I put it up there with the 'on Dublin street' series and 'Crossfire' series.<br />Very easy to read.
B003L77GGK|5.0|This was a birthday gift for my daughter. She had the other seasons and wanted this one, too. She loves it as much as the others.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|its lots of fun for a game to play at night before bed.  the kids also love to help pick out the new babies.
B004J4WLPU|5.0|What a great novel to read!  I wasn't expecting the book I was about to read, but I was pleasently surprised with the story line, characters and twists and turns!  The ending was a huge shocker, I wouldn't have guessed it or even fathomed it.  There are no give-aways to the ending, there are suttle hints but none that taint the plot twists and turns of the book.<br /><br />Background on the book: Beatrice's younger sister, Tess, has either committed suicide or been murdered after giving birth to a stillborn child, who received a cystic fibrosis cure in utero.  Beatrice flies home to England from New York, where she has been living, to cope with the aftermath of her sister's death.  She had missed a call from Tess the night she died-- no real explaination in her message but to call her- when Bee finds out Tess is dead, it adds wonder to why Tess called-- there was a huge reason.  The story is a first-person narrative, delivered as if Bee is speaking across the space of death to her sister, her own process of self-discovery ties into her investigative process of the truth about her sister's death brilliantly: in finding the truth about her sister, Bee finds the truth about herself. Tess leads Bee to her own person through a twisting, winding path, and the journey is complex and twisty!  As Bee breaks down everything that we supposedly know about her sister and everything she thought she knew about herself, she starts to build up new connections that she never would have thought possible.<br /><br />The literary, mystery, suspense, epistolary: they all combine beautifully here, masterfully mixed by Lupton, who takes the best from each genre as she strings the reader along on a page-turning journey. Highly recommended.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Men--and women sometimes--with not much to lose but their lives sail out into an ocean of no return to find a better life--and take as much of it home with them as possible.  Viking land isn't the best place to grow and raise food, and oil hasn't been discovered yet off the coast.  (What would they use it for anyway in 1000 AD?)  So, using an unproven (to them) crude navigation system off to England they go.  Culture clash!  They steal gold crosses, more gold, and a priest.  The priest is research.<br /><br />Interesting depiction of a lively bunch of guys and gals in a time that makes me glad I'm not there.  Darkly shot but I guess the world was a dark place then.  Looking forward to Season 2.
B005DJGMQE|4.0|It was quite thought provoking.<br />It subtle in how the lead character grew against the challenging place he was placed
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|My kids absolutely love this movie, I am deployed in Afghanistan right now and I sent this to my kids back home and it definitely scored me some kool dad points.
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|Even though I saw the movie when it first came out, I totally enjoyed seeing it again.  I was triggered to watch it again because of seeing the documentary &#34;Hitler's Children&#34; and the movie made even more sense this time around.  Movie was totally enjoyed a second time.
B000002KIQ|5.0|One never quite knows what to expect from Ry Cooder.  On this CD Ry is at his best as a musical archivist.  Great collection of tunes.
B004J4WKTW|2.0|I thought this book was going to be a bit more...exciting.  It was too dark for my taste, the characters weren't all that interesting (except for the invisible father), the story didn't develop as I had assumed it would, and I was just BORED.  When I read books, I finish them... so I was determined to finish this book!  The story isn't what you assumed it would be-- the Night Circus is literally about a traveling Night Circus with characters that have strange talents and show off those talents in the evening circus, it is not open in the daytime.<br /><br />I'm torn on this book because, I did enjoy the ending of the book, it was romantic and sweet, and made reading the book worthwhile... but the meat and bones of the book weren't interesting enough for me to feel the want to read again.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Reads like a historical account of a grim future.  The international setting lends it a very realistic atmosphere.  A must-read, and not only for those interested in zombies!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|my husband loves this movie and we got a free digital copy with the purchase...which was a great deal. now he can watch it on the ipad whenever he wants.
B000OJFV3S|5.0|i was looking for Game of Thrones when i came across this. thought i would check it out. 10 minutes in i decided it would be something my wife and i could watch together, she loved it as do i. great acting, good story-telling and a richly staged. almost at the end of season one only 4 days since we started.<br /><br />July 31st 2013 update<br />down to the last 2 episodes of season 4. this was a great show. i still like season 1 the best but the story is compelling and having checked facts several times this show is on the money even with small details like dress color at a specific event. this became my favorite series.<br /><br />May 2014 update<br />i decided to watch this again. having seen game of thrones since i last watched this i found it not as enjoyable as i hoped. still a great show, but watch this before GOT.
B004AO4FJ4|4.0|Great series. Rose is my favorite companion. Chris was a good doctor, wish we had more time to see what he could do.
B008JFUPK8|4.0|First of all, I'd like to point out that overkill is vastly overrated. That being said...<br /><br />Yes, here it is! Another re-boot of a classic comic book (\\"graphic novel\\") ready to be one of the box office smashes of the summer. Be warned...this thing is looooong (143 minutes), so watch your liquid intake! I found it interesting that in the packed screening last night, I didn't see ONE person dash out for a quick potty break, everyone was fascinated as we watched a little boy learn to cope with x-ray vision, super hearing and uncommon strength. I had never given it a second thought, had you?<br /><br />We have:<br />  * Henry Cavill (\\"Immortals\\") is our appealing new Kal-El/Superman. I hope this Brit is ready for the inevitable wave of publicity. He certainly looks the part and didn't embarrass himself in any way. He's craggier than Christopher Reeve, but has that same impossibly good-looking, sweet presence.<br />  * Amy Adams (\\"Trouble with the Curve\\") is Lois Lane, the bright-eyed reporter who is in his face from the get-go. She's too smart and is eager to spill the beans about our hero's identity. What a scoop!<br />  * Russell Crowe (\\"Les Miserables\\") as Jor-El, sends his infant son from Krypton, his own doomed planet. The heart and soul of this 90-minute plot is contained in that decision.<br />  * Kevin Costner (\\"Hatfields & McCoys\\") is Jonathan Kent the wise corn farmer who pulls that infant from the space capsule and raises him as his own. He convinced ME he was from Kansas...<br />  * Diane Lane (\\"Secretariat\\") is Martha Kent, Clark's beloved \\"Ma.\\"<br />  * Laurence Fishburne (\\"Contagion\\") is The Daily Planet newspaper publisher Perry White, in a nice update of the character.<br />  * Michael Shannon (\\"The Iceman\\") is General Zod, the main villain from Krypton, a zealot who never doubts for a moment that what HE believes, is absolutely right and true.<br />  * Antje Traue (\\"Seventh Son\\") is Faora-Ul, another survivor of Krypton; she proves to be just as indestructible as the other two.<br /><br />As directed by Zack Snyder (\\"300\\"), we have a charming 90-minute movie expanded to 143 minutes by padding it with LOTS of fisticuffs, Computer Generated Imaging, blowie uppie stuff, gunfire, space ships, missiles, collapsing skyscrapers, a planet split in two, a school bus sinking into a river, space debris, and a nice farm in Kansas (shot in Illinois). When I complained about all the CGI, my companion noted that it's the only way Superman can save the planet! ...sigh... This means you'll LOVE your DVD from Amazon so you can Fast Forward!<br /><br />This is PG-13, so expect surprisingly little blood, minimal profanity, one chaste kiss, many delicious bits of humor and the joy of watching decent people trying their best to do what's right. Oh! And be sure to suspend disbelief; this is, after all, a comic book.
B002R5QPRI|5.0|Love Whitney for life!!!! The bodyguard has always been one of my all time favorites! Rachel Marron and Frank Farmer are the ultimate characters!😍
B00138KDO6|5.0|I love Rage Against The Machine, but I had never heard this entire album before, just specific tracks off of it. Once AmazonMP3 had the album for 5 bucks, I bought it. Wish I would've bought it sooner.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This movie is so funny. You laugh from beginning to end. The singing is great but there is also a story line to follow. You won't go wrong with this one!I watch it over and over again.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|i think season 2 and three are my favorites. season one was getting rolling and setting the stage, but 2 and 3 are on it. liking the drama better than season 4 too. i became a fan in late season 3 and had to go back to see from the start. watch in order for best results, duh.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I purchased this book on the recommendation of a friend who said I had to read it, it was just so good. I will say it seemed interesting to start & kept me interested about a 3rd of the way through. Then the plot just got ridiculous. Neither protagonist was the least bit likeable & I found I didn't care what happened to either person. I plodded my way through it & some of the most foul language I've ever read in a book (seriously, who uses the \\"c\\" word that much?) only to get to an end that was the most unsatisfying end I have ever had the misfortune to read. I can't believe I wasted not only my money but time out of my life I won't ever get back again.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|I love this series and can't wait for new season to start ......if it does. I watched this while waiting on Downton Abbey to return and was pleasantly surprised. Good actors with historical perspectives of the times. Strong female leads. Good entertainment
B000V4NX04|5.0|After recent happenings, this is a must see for people who don't believe the gov't can and will get out of control.<br />Peter B.
B009UMTMKS|2.0|I think this is geared for a more engineering/developer minded audience.  If you have business school, consulting experience, some of this will not be new to you.  We ordered this for school and didn't really use it and has been left untouched for the most part.
B004W1GCNC|3.0|When I received a Kindle HD for Mother's Day, I was thrilled because I seldom get a chance to view TV series. As an avid fan of British series, I selected Upstairs Downstairs to view; however, some glitch prevented me from seeing the first episode from Season 1. After falling asleep during the first episode (not from boredom, but fatigue), attempts to view The Fledgling were unsuccessful. Even after reporting it to Amazon, I still cannot see the first episode. Have gone on to look at subsequent episodes, but I still want to see the first one, which lays the foundation for the storyline. Otherwise, I would give the series a higher rating. Please fix it!
B0095P31L6|4.0|Awesome Kid movie with a western twist. Johny Depp doing his thing. Taking over as Town Sheriff with a &#34;single&#34; bullet.
B000Y90VO2|5.0|God I miss this movie. I can't believe it's online now. Gotta love the slapstick. And back when Val Kilmer wasn't huge yet.
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|I don't like having to use internet to play the game, other than that it is ok.  Wish it would just play on my Kindle HD.
B00CWVFPGO|4.0|Heard this movie was good when it came out. Was happy to see it in the new movie queue...There's some BIG arnald sized holes in the plot..but then you don't watch an arnald movie for plot...Lets not hope for a Last Stand 2...one was enough...
034580404X|2.0|UPDATE: I finished reading volume II and III and what a disappointment!  Volume I was great but when you get into the other two volumes it is just a repeat of the same conversation and SO MUCH SEX!  The books would have been so much better if more time was spent on Jack Hyde, Mrs. Robinson and Leila but these characters were just a blip and skimmed over.<br /><br />I have almost finished reading book 1 and I just have one question:<br /><br />If Christian really does exist, WHERE IS HE?
B00CE03UOC|5.0|I've really enjoyed all the free flow games so it's no surprise that I enjoy this one as well. Anyone who has liked the others should like this one too.
B005LAIHGI|5.0|always loved his humor. all the way from his show. love how he tricks people into thinking he is crazy. the reviews not liking it are crazy. but to each his own.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I admit I started watching this just because of all the buzz surrounding this show. I didn't think I would like it at all. Imagine my surprise when I was addicted after the first episode! It is nice to be able to watch a show with my daughter without worrying the content will be too harsh for her! I watched all the episodes within 2 weeks!
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|This movie about Hitchcock is just as riveting as his movies are! Loved it. BTW, my hubby and I have been big fans of the Face Off competition which focuses on makeup prosthetics, etc., and we are amazed at the applications done on Anthony Hopkins to get him to look like Hitchcock... especially the bath scene. The make-up artists are amazing!
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|was this better than arnald's (yes i know it's arnold..i spell it like he says it)...no..but then i liked arnald's version too..for it's time...I liked this movie too..and my girl kate makes a good replacement for saran stone any day of the week...It's good enough that i will watch again when it's free...
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Very well written book but such a shameful period of our history.  Family is simply those who truly love us.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|I'm not a big Tom Cruise fan, but he is a good pick for this role.  This movie was action packed and really fun to watch.  It does a good job of explaining the plot as it goes, so you can keep up while enjoying the stunts and fast pace.  I'd recommend it.
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|The story, the cast, the acting, the perfect soundtrack...a Scorsese Masterpiece...arguably his BEST FILM!!<br /><br />Captures the thought process of the gangsters in organized crime as well as many of the subtle non crime related nuances of Italian - American culture.<br /><br />I have seen this over and over and over again. I own it and I own the soundtrack. It is timeless.<br /><br />AN ABSOLUTE MUST SEE AND A MUST ADDITION TO ANYONE'S PERSONAL VIDEO LIBRARY!!<br /><br />Oh, BTW, if you find violence or strong language offensive, stay away!
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I had seen Les Mis in person and was blown away. My whole family eagerly anticipated this movie coming out! When it finally did, I saw it with not only my daughters, but my father, sister, and stepmom. I loved it so much, I went back again that night and even one more time before it left my city!! The music is very moving, the cast has amazing voices, and listening to this takes me right back to the theater!
B000059XVS|5.0|purchased to add to my collection. will transfer to dvd at a latter time frame. good movie, I like very much.
B009RI4ZKC|3.0|this is a watch with your wife movie...when it's done you can feel slightly amused and not like you've just wasted a bunch of time...good acting..old timey story...i need more popcorn...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game.the horses seem so real that you think that you can really touch them and that they are really reacting to you.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Few differences from the book. But great overall! Great love story. Loved it! Loved it! Loved it! I seem to love all movies that have been made from Nicholas Sparks books.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The characters is this series are so interesting, and the acting  is very well done. The story line moves at a good pace and the plot always keeps you guessing.  Just when you think you're comfortable with thye cast, they introduce another great character.  Maggie Smith is absolutely superb!
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|This is a great prequel to the original movie. I am so glad I bought it. The special effects are really enjoyable and the even &#34;big&#34; kids loved watching it.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|The events kept me interested to see what would happen next, but the characters were even more mesmerizing. Loved it!
0061537934|5.0|I think that this was one of the first in the craze of dog books.  I know it didn't catch on right away and our book club read it after it had been out about a year.  We all have dogs.  It is about so much more than a dog narrating his story.  And it led me to learn more about Ayrton Senna.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Bought this for my Kindle fire so my grandson can play.  He loves it.  It's like Legos in a handheld.  Easy to move pieces and build houses, buildings and roads.  He says it's the best.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|This is a great addition to our already started collection.  I highly recommend it to complete the collection that someone may have.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like the clearness of the screen and the ease of moving the cards. Also I can use it any place i take my Kindle.
B00364K6YW|5.0|Excellent production, all aspects from music to acting to final production.  Watched many times.  Highly recommend this version of Pride & Prejudice.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|This movie was very well done and interesting, and after seeing it, I researched this incident and found out what really happened. The story the movie told was a mixture of fact and fiction. I'm not sure why they didn't stick to the facts.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I have recommended this book to all my reading friends.  We read it for our book club and we were all touched by the characters and the story.  Who wouldn't be drawn in by a character who worked at the Buttered Bun.  Seriously, the characters were realistic as was the theme.  In a book that taps the reader emotionally, it is sometimes difficult to have a believable conclusion.  This book worked from beginning to end.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Good ol' rock & roll Rod Stewart style.  Great lyrics and music.  He is even better with age.  Welcome back Rod!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Like the movies and watch them alot.  The kids enjoy the movies and this is a great addition to the collection.
B009NX3U20|4.0|Interesting effects on the common man view of a monster in Manhattan.  The handheld camera works although it does get a bit dizzying.  However, I think the viewpoint does come off well.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|could not get along without it. color choice is best, I use a soft pink. cozy, homey feel ghat is easy to use.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I love the game. I AM a grown up and find it very relaxing. Terrific for Kids to teach responsibilities to animals without hurting one! LoL
B008AK8FHM|5.0|So glad that I'm a believer! I don't know what to think about many of his assertions, but overall I agree with what he says.
B00BTHWFBK|4.0|So, this is a great album! Fantastic riffs and Geezers bass has aged like fine wine. When I first heard that Sabbath was going to record a new album of course I got very excited,  but still a small voice inside reminded me to not get too excited. This is why I chuckled to myself when we all later heard the news that Bill Ward backed out. I chuckled out of frustration...not because I was pleased I forsaw that it was too good to be true. Maybe my doubt came from them canceling on me not once, not twice, but three times before returning my money when I had great seats to see them with Pantera during the reunion tour. My love for Sabbath lessoned just a little when that happened. Like always its now about money and not music or fans. If any of you reading this has read Peter Criss's book he released not too long ago, you may see some similarities between Bill and Peter. I don't know what happened,  but it would be hard to take a smaller cut than say Ozzy or Tony...on something like a new album and tour that would surely bring in lots of cash because of it containing the original members. Too bad that the fun of making music takes a backseat to money. So 4 stars not 5 because its great but with Bill it would have been greater.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|This is a great collection, highly recommend it to anyone that is a Star Trek fan, recording is just fine.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|Disappointing considering I am a huge fan of the Die Hard series. It was nothing like the other 4 films, John Mclane was a shell of his former self in this movie. Very generic, similar to the typical garbage pumped out today.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie. It was funny, sweet, and very entertaining.it seemed like a different way of jumping on this whole zombie craze going on.
B001NA6096|3.0|A lot of cussing. The movie dragged.  I thought it was going to be very romantic & steamy, it just was too much talking.
B004GYY714|5.0|Works as advertised.  Good not only for listening live but for replaying programs on pbs websites. Also records and has sleep timer.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I like app for one important reason...it delivers a numeric percentage of battery life on my status bar.  Very convenient. Very useful.
B0066O0MZW|5.0|I rarely leave a comment for mostly because many tv shows are not worth the effort or the time to watch them and then to waste words further on a comment makes little sense.<br /><br />Sometimes too many words clouds the review.<br /><br />In a word, at least so far, but then again I am only on the 19th episode of the first session, one word comes to mind, which sums up this comment is \\"riveting.\\" Rarely does tv do this well.<br /><br />The show is well acted, well edited and directed and very well written, including, but not limited to a show that is written with intelligence.<br /><br />Caution: The series is addictive to say the least.
B009NY43NY|2.0|If you ask me, Harris came up short with this book. Shouldn't have cone as a surprise considering that the last couple books were lacking imagination. In my personal opinion she got a big head after having such a success with the first few books. Not wanting her success to end with her Sookie series she decided to focus on other projects, putting this series on the back burner. Big mistake Mrs Harris, being careless about the series that got you noticed in the first place will only scare your readers away. I for one after reading this book feel I have wasted not only my money, but my time and energy reading this series. I should have taken the clue two books ago. I'm sad to say, I will not be picking up any more books written by Harris. To say this is the way she always had intended for this book to end all along, only proves how little she put into the writhing of this book. Too bad I can't get my money back.
140132634X|3.0|Mitch Albom, the author of The Five People You Meet In Heaven and One More Day is back with another heartwarming tale about how to appreciate the things we have rather than always lamenting the things we don't.<br /><br />The Time Keeper is something like a cross between a fairy tale and a fable.  The story begins in ancient times, telling us the story of Dor, the very first human being to count time.  Then Albom jumps us to the present day and introduces us to Victor, a hardened and selfish businessman who craves immortality, and Sarah, a misfit of a teenager who feels she doesn't have much to live for.  Albom weaves the stories of these three characters around and around each other until finally tying them together into a shining, golden cord of pure inspiration.<br /><br />The characters of Sarah and Victor are stereotypes, I can't argue with that.  How many times have we read stories about suicidal teenagers who don't fit in and wealthy tyrants who think their fortunes can buy them immortality?  Quite a few times.  I believe, however, that Albom used these cutout figures intentionally.  They are opposite ends of a spectrum, one who wants more time and one who wants less.  Between these two polar opposites sits all of humanity, every single one of us.  Albom's message is directed at each of us.  And his message is not buried in a lot of flowery prose filled with big words and overly complex sentences; it's very plain for those willing to hear it.  In this day and age that's something I can really appreciate.<br /><br />Dan Stevens is a perfectly adequate narrator.  Nothing special perhaps, but easy enough to listen to.  His reading sounds natural and while he's not great at creating character voices, he does at least make the attempt.  It wasn't a bad job at all.<br /><br />The Time Keeper is a fairy tale for the modern age.  We all have only so much time and it's up to us how we spend it.  Don't wait until your life is almost over to look back and wish you had spent it better.  Make the most of it now, while there's still time.pent it better.  Make the most of it now, while there's still time.
B000B5IPLK|5.0|My mother loves the version of &#34;Wild Horses&#34; Alicia did with Adam Levine so I decided to get her the whole CD as a Mother's Day gift and she LOVES it.
0723257639|5.0|This collection is great and so nicely put together in a beautiful box.  Perfect for a Grandma to read to the grand children.  Watching the movie &#34;Miss Potter&#34; was wonderful to get to know the author.
B0092C2X7U|5.0|This game is super fun been playing it for the past 2 hours, completely recommend the full version. Only one problem found is not reset on the gameplay screen, you have to pause to reset, just a little frustrating,  but still fun. Definate Download!!!!!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I've only used it once but like how easy it is to use. I don't use a calculator often but it's nice to have it handy
1451695195|4.0|Very Inspirational book, I was very glad that I took the time to buy this book, not a waste of time.
B001GUXJQA|4.0|I enjoy reading Connelly's &#34;Harry Bosch&#34; stories.  He cares about justice more than what others think.  He follows the trail of evidence till he gets the culprit.
B00328G4V6|5.0|Brilliant album by Jimi Hendrix. Some songs I've never heard, others I know but the playing, voicing of the guitar and other instruments quite different. Shows a remarkable talent that Jimi had, and oh yes such a beautiful voice he had too!!
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|this is the best movie ever. I have watched it only seven or eight hundred times. downloaded it to my iphone and watched it 4 times on the plane. fantastic, just fantastic.
B00CHILW64|5.0|The Impossible, is a drama film directed by Juan Antonio Bayona and co-produced by two Spanish companies. It is based on the true ordeal that Maria Belon and her family lived during the 2004 Tsunami that caused so much destruction within many coasts in the Indian Ocean, including the island of Khao Lak, Thailand, were the Belon's were spending their vacations. The main characters are played by Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor.<br />The movie starts with the arrival to Khao Lak of the Bennett's Family: Maria (Naomi Watts), her husband Henry (Ewan McGregor) and their three young sons Lucas, Tomas and Simon. Everything seemed to be the perfect vacation until the deadly Tsunami hit the peaceful area destroying everything on its path and sweeping apart the Bennett's family.<br />Naomi Watts gives a riveting performance, as you can feel her pain and suffering, no doubt why she was an Oscar nominee!. Tom Holland who plays Lucas, the oldest son of Maria, delivers a noteworthy performance as you live with him this extreme experience.<br />The movie is rated PG-13; however the Tsunami scene is very realistic. The aftermath is very realistic too and for some sensitive kids (as mine) that may be quite disturbing, for example, the injures that Maria had in her thorax and in her leg are very graphic and my 13 year daughter decided to stop watching it. There are no sex scenes but only three scenes were Naomi shows her half naked torso.<br />Overall is a great movie, with a message of hope, perseverance and endurance, in the midst of a real tragedy lived by a common family.
B005LAIIKI|1.0|SPOILER ALERT! The movie starts. From there on out, it's spoiled.<br /><br />Leave it to Tarantino to use a decent story, great actors, and great photography and take them on a whirlwind tour from cheesy ripoff to ridiculous farce. He said that he wanted to do a \\"genre film\\" but apparently doesn't understand the difference between \\"homage\\" and artistic sodomy. Not that spaghetti westerns were great films by most standards. But paying tribute to a style and making a complete mockery of it, while still expecting your movie to be taken seriously? Well, that's just a little beyond idiotic. Ever since his early successes he seems bent on seeing how far he can push an audience before they finally decide that's the last of their money he'll ever see. Remember Quentin, Jerry Lewis may have been considered a genius, but only by the French.<br /><br />Let's suspend disbelief long enough to accept the premise of the film. No, make that \\"the movie.\\" I've seen better film on teeth! But let's say we accept the premise. Even if he's addressing the glaring inhumanity of slavery, he seems confused as to the difference between Django becoming a free man and being an equal. About the time he shot the first white man, whether he was free and justified or not, he'd have been strung up and that would be the end of the movie. Even beyond that, Tarantino seems to have less understanding than most four-year-old children have of what happens when someone gets shot! A single shot from a pistol whips a woman's body out of the scene as if tied to a rocket; other shots resulting in fountains of blood spewing into the air and coating walls in a way that would make Monty Python envious!<br /><br />And apparently, Tarantino now fancies himself to be Alfred Hitchcock, sneaking his ever widening butt onto the screen wherever he can. Hint: Hitchcock was being playful and joking around by doing it, and it became his signature. He wasn't just whoring for camera time. Hitch also didn't feel the need to have someone decapitated in order to scare or shock an audience. In fact, he never showed Janet Leigh actually stabbed even one time in the famous shower scene from Psycho. In addition to those examples, he also had more talent in the second roll on his chin than you could ever hope for.<br /><br />And yet this dog of a movie received 5 Oscar nominations and actually WON for best screenplay? Of course, this is the same industry that thinks it's a good idea to put out The Expendables II, The Last Exorcism Part II, and now a sequel to Finding Nemo. They've started remaking not only GOOD films, but crappy ones as well. (Did we REALLY need another \\"Total Recall?\\") So, rest easy Quentin. Perhaps H. L. Mencken was right when he said \\"Nobody ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American public.\\" It appears your career is safe.
B000JQUHLM|4.0|Stuff to read when I have nothing else to do and am tired and just want to read this! It looked good!
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I like it. Quick and easy, and accurate. Perfect with the drop down menus easy access that shows how much time you have left. Very handy.
B007UQRW62|5.0|this is an awesome box set--not sure i need/will use the umbrella, but it's a cute, kitschy addition to the set.
B0049J2CKE|5.0|quality never failed or lessened. an amazing movie. watch it over an over again and could never fall out of love with it.
B004G0SJU8|4.0|Nice movie for a date night, has a few surprising plot twists also. Very family friendly movie that the kids can watch too.
B00AKFG15S|4.0|Having read Jeffrey Archer in the past,  this one is different with new settings if combining the best he had to offer. Take-overs, politics, smuggling, Cambridge scholarships, broken relationships, family reunions, revenge.....
B002XTBE6K|5.0|Emma is another of my favorites, I needed another long version, have the shortened version...enjoyed this much better!  Thanks for this!
B004HO6I2O|5.0|I knew this was going to be one of the best movie of all time and it is. Love everything about it. BUY IT!
B009OYTAL8|5.0|Love the series, and missed this episode, well worth the purchase. Thoroughly enjoy both the episode and the season, very TDK inspired which is a good thing.
B000ICXQXS|5.0|Almost perfect.  Everyone should see this film.  The plot, pacing and acting are superb.  We need more like this one.
B0000X61VE|5.0|I have owned this workout video for so long(feels like 20 years?). I know it has been criticized for some moves, but if you know the workout basics, you can do it correctly without hurting yourself.  Only one move I don't recommend for many is the full sit up.  If you have good stomach strength and good back, you eventually reach the point to do it right without hurting yourself.<br /> I love this workout in general because it has a lot of movements using the leg joints around the bikini line.  In western world, they don't talk about much, but that area is very important for lymphatic system flows.  These moves this video has work a lot on those, I feel.<br />Also, I like that it's not a typical aerobics, but you get your cardio worked up good.  I think it's suitable for a home workout because you don't jump up and down.<br /> This video is fun to watch and I love the music.  To me it beats those boring aerobic routines.  But amazingly it is tough workout.  If you are not fit, you body will be aching first.  Though if you continue, I guarantee you will look good.  I think this workout is aimed to make you look good, rather make you feel good.  So if you want just a good feeling, refreshing workout, this video is not for you.  If you want to work hard and look good (not bulky, or masculine), go for it.<br /> I originally had VHS video.  On the other day, I took it out to do the work, and video is really old, so I've ordered DVD.  I read about other Cindy's workout videos, but I'll stick to this one.
1741797802|5.0|Was great for figuring out which trains to take, where to stay, and what to do.  Good overview and nice tidbits of history.  Exactly what you'd expect from Lonely Planet.
B00BAB6CNC|4.0|I enjoyed part 1 better, but this is a good album, with more melody than the first one. I hoped for heavier sounds but It didn't happen. I recommend it for anyone who enjoys rock music or Stone Sour.
B008Q0CO0U|4.0|Super fun movie. If your on Prime, you should check it out when you need an action fix.Wahlberg does his usual, 'Im pissed' look, while smokin the bad guys!
193700788X|5.0|I absolutely love the Sookie Stackhouse novels and am saddened they have come to an end. Charlaine Harris has a wit and charm about her characters that draws you in regardless whether they are simple folk or vampires!<br /><br />I have all of the series, love the stories and the imagination she puts into each one.<br /><br />Can't recommend it enough!<br /><br />Thanks!
B004TMPJP6|1.0|The only reason I got this app for my Kindle was so I could use it on my Windows Phone, but Wunderlist removed support for Windows Phones and took the app out of the marketplace. FAIL. One star.
B007SGM084|4.0|When I first heard about these books I was against reading them. However I borrowed them from someone else to try them after a few of my friends had raved about them. They were right and they are not at all what I thought they were going to be. I thought they were about a sadistic man who beats the woman he loves and she keeps coming back for more. This is not the case at all this is about a love story that shows what the healing power of love can do for someone. It has kink in it which is good because there should be spice in life. I would recommend these books to anyone and everyone plus you never know what you might find you like until you check it out.
0738737909|5.0|The cards are beautiful, and they are so full of life. For example, you can hear the rain and feel the pain with the three of swords. With the ten of cups, you can smell the grass and dance with the children, the artwork is just that real. Living, breathing tarot cards is what you will get with this gorgeous deck. There is no other deck like it, it is truly a masterpiece. Buy it, you won't be disappointed.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|This game is a great example of what a platformer should be on Android.  The character doesn't just take off running like most of the side scrolling platformers.

1451635672|5.0|Son received this at Christmas  time and has enjoyed it, this is something that he  has wanted for quite sometime.
0061726834|5.0|So that I won't rewrite my review, here is a part of it from Goodreads:<br /><br />\\"\\"Delirium\\", by Lauren Oliver was a delicious and stunning surprise a midst the other dystopian books available. Honestly, when I saw the cover and title in the library, I was not thinking \\"dystopia\\" per se, but when I read the blurb about how the government has the \\"cure\\" for love- I was hooked.<br /><br />So the story is that Lena, the protagonist lives in a society where the only thing that causes pain is love- wow. It is amor deliria nervosa- a pretty name for love and there is a painful procedure anyone 18 and up must take. Lena is actually excited about taking the shot because she remembers how emotions drove her own mother to suicide and maybe getting the cure is the answer...until Lena falls in love with Alex.\\"<br /><br />With that being said, I truly enjoyed this work of dystopian fiction. Oliver managed to bring reality to the pages. We are in a world that is built on a system of logic coupled with the nurture and the pain of love. What happens when that is taken away? As Alex has told Lena- without love there is hate but without hate the worse thing is indifference.<br /><br />A gorgeous, well told story.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|Beautifully and thoughtfully written. The characters were intelligent, without pretension and utterly believable. They were noble and unselfish.<br /><br />I really, really enjoyed this story, but I am so grateful that I live in this lifetime!
B004X2M3N8|5.0|Fantastic show if you like a little intrigue mixed in with your comedy and sci-fi. This season explains the relationship between The Doctor and River Song and will leave you mind blown.
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|we open with a woman whose husband is released from prison following a four year imprisonment due to insider trading. they lost everything with his conviction.  he emerges from prison with pie in the sky plans with others he met in prison with similar convictions.  his wife reacts by returning to acute episodes of depression, a disease she has been treated for in the past. this is a movie which looks like a civil action, malpractice and product liability over a depression drug she takes.  however, it takes a sharp veer into criminal law instead. as the criminal part builds, the film loses all credibility with reality.<br /><br />the rest are SPOILERS<br /><br />the HUGE problem is that soderbergh seems to have gotten no legal input on his script, either to the law itself or as to how attorneys think and behave. contrary to his film, mental patients confined to hospitals have detailed and exhaustive civil liberties which must be observed.  they have the right to an attorney of their choice who can challenge her confinement and/or course of treatment. it is a judge who oversees the whole matter, not a doctor. if the judge is told by these conspirators that the patient was really sane, was guilty of murder and should be kept in the mental hospital as punishment, the conpirators' plan, the judge will order the patient released. this is because double jeopardy attached and she has met the terms of release, she is sane. the judge will next order all of the conspirators investigated. eventually they will all lose their licenses and also be prosecuted.<br /><br />also prosecutors and defense attorneys are not shocked over the prosecutors discovering they made a bad plea deal or the defense attorneys discovering that they got a guilty person either off or with a good deal. they do this every day! they certainly do not enter into criminal conspiracies to right these wrongs! they are advocates.  they do not CARE about the reality of individual cases. prosecutors care about advancing their careers so as to be the lead prosecutor and then ever higher political office.  criminal defense attorneys are concerned about winning as many cases as possible to advance their careers. both also loathe psychiatrists so would never pick one as a criminal co-conspirator.<br /><br />don't the people who make these films do any research?  i liked it until half way through when they started mangling american law beyond recognition.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

0446608955|3.0|Well this is my first foray into this genre, so I think I am reasonably unbiased. And I have never written a review for a book before so bare with me.<br /><br />I saw the movie and enjoyed it. I enjoyed it enough that I thought I should give the book a try, after all books are always better than the movie, right?<br /><br />I don't love the book, but I don't hate it like some of the 1 star reviews. My biggest problem with this is that it was really predictable. Even if I hadn't seen the movie I could have seen most of this coming. Also, as short as the book was, the pacing still seemed a little slow. When things get going it does move at good pace, but it takes a while to get there. Lastly, for some reason it kind of  seemed like a childish romance.<br /><br />So what did I like? The characters were pretty good. They all had flaws, which makes them more people and makes it easier for people to sympathize with them.<br /><br />Characters<br />Landon- In the beginning I thought he was a bit of a jerk, but I realized that he's just immature. Although I do believe that he's more responsible than his friends.<br />Jamie- I really did love her. I am always attracted to characters that are not afraid to be themselves no matter the situation. As much as we'd all like to say we act that way, most of us really don't. And Sparks did a good job of making me believe that she was like this in real life. Because she was so mature she was able to deal with all the struggled that followed as the book progress. Her flaw, she's socially oblivious. I'm not sure how realistic the character is, but nonetheless I liked her.<br />Mr. Sullivan-I really liked him because he gave Landon a chance, even after the history between the two families. I felt that 90% of the things he did were to protect his daughter. No one can blame him for that.<br /><br />So would I recommend this book? I guess, but only if you are looking for a really short read to pass the time. This was a fine book, but the movie was better.
B009RH973I|4.0|First cover I've ever used for my Kindle so don't have opinion of others.  It's opens and closes easily and seems to protect all the vital parts that need protection from scrapes and bumps.  Haven't done a full blown drop onto a hard surface so don't know how well it will hold up but expect it will do well.  A good product for the price.
B009R659L8|5.0|Loved this book!  Twists and turns throughout, Clark, once again, lives up to expectations and hits one out of the park!
B00AG8GTVA|5.0|Once again MoFi did not fail. This LP is very quiet. All you hear is the music. I'm a big Allman Brothers fan from way back and have been buying MoFi's releases as they come out to add to my collection. You will not be disappointed.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Much like the one I have on my desk top that I play all the time. Will love this on the go.
0449227545|3.0|This was not one of my favorite books from Ken Follett.  I have really liked many of his other novels.
B00985E3UG|5.0|In depth investigative reporting on Big Food industry.  You will come way understanding how the industry started, how it functions today and what they depend on for survival.  While you are tempted to vilify Big Food, you will find yourself empathizing and understanding how Big Food did not &#34;understand&#34; how they were contributing to an unhealthy America-- until recent.  You will also understand your culpability as a consumer as we all want our food purchases to &#34;taste good&#34;.
0756407915|2.0|I absolutely loved the Name of the Wind. Wise Man's Fear started off brilliant and I easily fell back in with the story and the characters. The first day, I raved to people about the book. The second day, after I had finished it, I was calling people back and telling them not to bother. I feel like Rothfuss sold out on some themes within the book that were unnecessary. The overall spirit and character of Kvothe seemed to be abandoned in the middle of the narrative. Also his goal. He keeps alluding to finding out more about the Chandrian but definitely doesn't feel pressed for time. By the end, I was basically skimming through to see what happened to Denna. If I manage to read 'Day Three' it will solely be see a resolution for her story. My respect and fascination with Kvothe plummeted to the point where it would take another 'Day One' writing style and devotion to the initial plot to get me interested at all.
B000HF6XV8|5.0|I love this movie.  This is my favorite version of The Secret Garden.  A friend let me borrow this video several years ago and I needed to get a copy of my own so I can watch it any time I want.  Very happy that Amazon offered this video for sale.  It arrived very quickly and I am so pleased to have this movie in my collection.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|fantastic movie, this should have won many Oscars.  I usually dont watch movies over and over again and I have seen this one many times!
B000W93CHC|5.0|Out standing book a good sequel to Mr Collette first book. Very well done and a very captivating historical book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway suffers is the beast game ever and you never get board of it. There are loads of new challenges and missions too defeat and loads of new places too go. Also there are loads of different characters too unlock.
0756405890|4.0|As first novels go, this book was unbelievably well put-together. I was hooked on the story from the beginning. Kvothe has such a fascinating history and an intriguing 'in-the-moment' life that I was never disappointed when the author would flip back and forth between past and present. Very artistically and delicately written.
B00821PCJS|4.0|I am glad I found this show on Amazon.  I can't wait to catch up. What else can I say?
B00CL50KDY|4.0|Cute movie and a neat twist to the walking dead genre, the effects were great and story line very cute.
B00CISC2DA|5.0|I was so excited when I put on \\"Tomorrow's Harvest\\" as the soundtrack for my long, meandering car ride, as I have done with their previous albums. And as before, I slowly became more and more disappointed with each song. I was so bummed. I wanted to say that I loved the album right away; the album I waited so long for was a let down. The songs seemed repetitive and I wasn't getting that weird, magical BoC feeling that I had hoped for... I had expected this album to be their greatest work. But a few hours later I thought about the album and couldn't remember a single song, so I played the album again. This time though, I was a little more familiar with the music and I wasn't putting so much pressure on myself to like what I was hearing.  With each new listen, I fell more and more in love. Yes, it is definitely dark and has an eery feel similar to Geogaddi. But it's not so \\"other-worldly\\" and zany, it feels desolate and extremely dreary (in a beautiful way). I think the album is also considerably heavier than their others, with a lot of very powerful bass and cracking snares. I think it's awesome and I'm taking my time getting to know this album. I know it will be just as amazing and different as the rest of Boards of Canada's music and I am already appreciating the unique sound that separates it from the rest of their work. I don't understand how people have already gone through and rated each song when the album just came out! I'm still trying to wrap my head around the music I've been listening to for years. I think you should consider your expectations before you even begin listening to this album. Boards of Canada wouldn't let you down!
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|This was a great book! It was as good as matched i cant wait to read reached but i will be sad that the series is over it is an AMAZING series
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|iT MADE YOU NOT WANT TO BUT IT DOWN. THE STORY WAS WRITEN VERY WELL. i AS READY ALL THREE OF THEBOOKS. REALLY LIKE Cassandra Clare books
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|I hope they keep this show on the air because it's amazing, witty and the acting is great! There is gore, so some episodes are not for the weak.
B009EDYZBY|4.0|I thought it was a cute story on how the irresponsible chipmunk stepped up to look after the others on the island. The story line was good. I would recommend this movie to any one with kids old enough to understand the story line.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Amazingly thrilling. Eloquently written. Great mix of history and fantasy. Follett thrills enlightens and shocks on every page. Loved it.
B000AMJDHY|2.0|This is just a boring album with a lot of boring synthopop beats. The worst thing about this album is the swearing, which is something that usually isn't bad about a song. Why? Because the profanity used is not amusing and the songs don't make me laugh. The worst case of profanity (and the worst song on this musical trash) is \\"I Write Sins Not Tragedies\\". The GD word is the worst case of profanity on this CD (mainly because I dread that word (especially in music, especially rap) and refuse to use it in my life) but also because it is more commonly used uncensored on YouTube videos with profanity. This really moves the wrong way, because I'M SO SICK OF IT. The only song that I actually HATE WITH A FIREY PASSION on this record is \\"I Write Sins Not Tragedies\\". The GD word isn't used used exactly unnecessarily in the song, I just REALLY HATE it. The last thing I will say is this band does better with their newer stuff and at least they don't SUCK immediately like all rappers when they use the GD word in the most unnecessary way.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|OMG! I got this game for my son and I actually play it more than he does. Gotta collect more allege. Gotta get more rare fish. It kinda sucks though when others go to your reef and collect your brain coral or high producing stuff you have been waiting for and they are already cashed in!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I thought it was mostly boring. It wasn't hot and steamy like the first two. I was disappointed that the most interesting thing was toward the end. But I'm looking forward to the next book. Hopefully soon.
B009R659L8|3.0|Mary put together a good story in this mystery thriller. I was totally surprised by who the quilty party turned out to be. Did not suspect this person at all. I was very into the story until I finished it. What turned out to surprise me the most was Mary's use of profanity near the end of the story. Though I have not read all of Mary Higgins Clark's books I have read a lot of them. I have never read one before where she had a character take God's name in vain.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|He suggested this rating. He played it the entire day and loves the movie as well. I think it is more because of the movie. :)
B009ZXT4BY|2.0|The animation was to confusing, the controls were mixed up too much, some of the spawning eggs would not spawn in creative mode, and overall Survivalcraft wasn't fun, exciting like in Minecraft, and the game did not keep me hooked.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Love this game. Hours of fun and so many different towers to use. Wabble wabble wabble. Black and White and grey.
B005KG43AM|5.0|I would most definitely recommend this item to my family and friends. When it comes to classical music, what's not to like?
B00785P2QC|3.0|It is a good game. Simple and basic sim like building game.  It's a great time waster and could keep you busy for a while.
B006RXQ800|5.0|It's got the best story. It's fun, scary, sad, loving, historical, mean and just plain good acting. It's just crazy!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My Horse free is a great game. It lets you take care of your own horse and compete. But all the accessories are a little too much game money cause people aren't going to spend 24/7 on the game. My Horse is still a great game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it's a really good game its one of the best i played they have very good deals in the shop and really cool hoverboards and awesome surfers and i think this app is really cool
B00BQ1D7X4|4.0|I've read a lot of negative things about this album,so when I got ready to listen to it I was prepared to be underwhelmed.I gave it a whirl and was pleasantly surprised.This is a good album with only one problem.The songs are too long.This record comes in at around 67 minutes.I believe it would have been a better album had most of the songs been 2 minutes or so shorter. On the plus side this album sounds great,the songs are strong and it is heavy.I like it better than \\"Black Gives Way...\\"
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|I played this game on my second generation Kindle Fire with no performance issues whatsoever.  It's a pretty good example of a point and click adventure.  The graphics are complex and the story line is standard for this type of game, but nothing wrong with that.<br /><br />I'd like a few less hidden object scenes, but that's just me.  There was a wide range in the HO screens in this game.  Some of them were wonderfully quick and clear(bear in mind I don't like the things!) but there were a few that I finally used a hint to find the last object.  At least there weren't too many objects in each one.<br /><br />The game runs you around, big time, like most of these games.  There is a map that tells you where you are and where there are things to be done.  You can ignore this, of course, if you want to make the game longer and harder, but I found it very helpful when I got stuck, or just tired of running around from scene to scene.  It wasn't always readily apparent what to do next, or how to navigate where I wanted to go.  There is a list of objectives and an abbreviated journal which is helpful without being a lot of boring exposition.  Speaking of boring and tedious, though, the little man guarding the chest and taking the coins got old fast.<br /><br />The game was pretty long, with a bonus chapter, and I got it on sale at a good price.  I just don't think I'm going to pay $4.99 for any game at this point (except maybe The Haunt 3).  For further reference to see if your tastes coincide with mine, my favorite games were Theatre of the Absurd, Enigmatis, Sacra Terra, The Vanishing Hitchhiker, Stray Souls (The Dollhouse Story), The Abyss (Wraiths of Eden), The Lost City, and all the MumboJumbo games.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is my new favorite show. Me and my daughter are addicted. We can't wait for season 4 to start.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is a very informative book, with tremendous supporting scientific facts. Well written, in a format that is easy to read and understand.
B005CRQ2IU|5.0|Much has been said about the graphic novel, Watchmen, a collection of the 12 issue 1985 comic book series written by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons. I have little to add but my admiration. It's a beautifully structured story and could not have been told in any other medium. The movie directed by Zack Snyder did its best to turn its words and pictures into shots and cuts, but nothing substitutes for the original. This Kindle version does the graphic novel one better by showcasing the art in crystal-clear digital goodness, so I highly recommend it for reading on a tablet or computer.
0451232852|5.0|I was given Fall of Giants by a fellow reader who thought I would enjoy reading it. I had read Follett many years ago so I was excited to read another one of his books.<br />I was not disappointed, it took me a bit to get started but once I did, I did not want to put it down. The characters are so well developed that you feel you really have known them and they really did live and effect history.<br />I look forward to reading the next in the series.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|great app,! I play it all the time. you will have tons of fun playing for hours at a time
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|I have many jobs that I do and this App will help me keep projects straight if I can remember to useit.
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|Bought this on my PS3 to watch on tv with my 7.1 surround sound system. Turned volume 98% of the way up and still couldn't hear the movie. Next time I will not waste my money with movies from amazon i will just buy the blue ray (this evening i didn't want to waste the gas to go to the store) but i wasted my money on AMAZON.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Umm why would she end it there? Kind of disappointed that was it. Just wants our money for the next.books!<br /><br />Still a great book.
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|I loved the continuous action as only Bruce Willis can perform.  I wouldn't expect any less of him.  He's great.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|As always, Your Video Library is easy, accessible and convenient to watch NCIS. The quality of the video is excellent and the streaming is seamless.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have always had Kindle. Recently I bought a new smartphone, so the app was installed. I love it ,always will.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Big ad boxes obscure video playback. I'm all for free apps powered by ads, but nog when the ads make the app unusable.
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|Great music.  Jon and Steve along with the crew do a spectacular job with both the music and the videos.
B002KS1IJC|5.0|What a great actor.  Jim was excellent and I love the action.  He's definitely an excellent actor and very compassionate.
B00BGI076M|5.0|It seems that this is a show that people either love or hate. Personally, I really loved it. The cast, the storyline (and the pacing of that storyline), the music, every aspect of this show just really had me hooked. I love anything with dark themes and disturbed/disturbing characters and jaw-dropping plot twists. You always think you know what's going to happen in this series, but then suddenly the story takes a turn you didn't see coming. I get that many feel that some of the pieces of the story are not super realistic, but personally I watch television for one reason: to be entertained, and that's just what this show is, pure entertainment. Loved it and cannot wait for season 2.
B000002OZY|5.0|Bought for my husband and my dad for father's day. Great memories of growing up listening to this album. Delivered in 2 days. Couldn't be happier
B006OCM0G0|5.0|From my 11 yr old daughter: I have been playing these games very much. They are sooooo cool but I want to ask. Can you change from spending actual money to using coins?  Then you can buy coins. I don't like using actual money for these kinds of games.  But any way, these games are really fun to play.
030758836X|1.0|I didn't like this book at all.  It started off interesting...first couple of chapters brought me into it....then it was down hill from there.  I found both characters just dumb and immature.  Why did they marry at all?  The story wasn't what I expected it to be.  I saw this story as nothing more than 2 dumb, young people married to each other---playing games.  A waste of my time!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game!!!!! I play this everyday. It's an addiction so don't be surprised when you play it more than talking on the phone.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Quick download and install on my kindle fire. Smooth controls and easy play. Had doubts from reading all the 5 star reviews but after trying it I can only agree with the others. Great game and super time waster.
0425252868|5.0|I so enjoyed this book that I would rate it six stars if I could.  Not only was the story well-written, with no misspellings, but it made me feel good.  Although the principal incident is only a small part of the book, what makes this compelling is how well the author explains the personalities of the two main characters and their parts in the huge World War II machines of the United States and Germany.  This was the first book I read that explained what life was like in the Luftwaffe. One can truly appreciate the sacrifices made during that terrible war.  The best book I've read this year.<br />The book held my interest to the very end. Highly recommended for all.
B003G4W49C|2.0|I really don't know why all the four and five star reviews. Usually like fantasy/sci fi, but this was just didn't do anything for me.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Great game, it's like soduku meets connect the dots.  You end up drawing pictures using a kind of mathmatical-puzzle grid.  Highly addictive.
B00969PR18|4.0|It works well. Since kindle doesn't have GPS it's not quite as good as maps on my phone, but I would recommend it.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Hard to believe the price of this book! I would easily rank this up there with GRRM, Rothfus, and Sanderson! Well done! Eagerly awaiting the second book! (one more &#34;!&#34; for good measure)
B00992CF6W|5.0|Although it's not entirely like Minecraft PC, I still love it. It's worth the $7.00 in my opinion. I would necessarily pick the PC version over this one, but since the PC version doesn't work on my computer, I enjoy using this one nonetheless. I'm glad I bought both the PE and PC versions. Most of the Minecraft copies you see in the App Store, I suggest you don't buy because 60 to 75% of the time you'll be disappointed. Although Survivalcraft is okay, if you're a hardcore Minecraft fan, you shouldn't buy it, mostly because there are shapes besides squares and rectangles, such as triangles, but that's just my opinion. I adore this game and it deserves every single one of the five stars I've given it.
B005M5PENG|4.0|Brought back memories of the original, but the modern version is much better. I probably just like the hunkier guys - LOL!
B0063GORYU|5.0|So glad I downloaded this app. I use it daily when I have down time. I have never had any trouble with the app at all.
B004JMZPJG|5.0|the goods is very nice, i like it. when i reseive it, i use it immediately, i find the goods quality is good, no problem.
B009EHDU7U|5.0|This is the best book I have read in years.The adventures of Allen were compelling reading. I could not put the kindle down. I have told everyone about it. They have been raving about it also.
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|This game stinks first I got the game went in and it had to load again and in took forever finally I was at 6.00 out of108.18 and I am deleting it now warning getting game at own risk.

B005LAIII0|3.0|Lack of extras, or directors commentary keep me from giving it five stars.  I would love to know &#34;how&#34; this picture was made!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app does all you need and gives a bunch of extra useful and interesting info in a good package.  Iep. like the temp. monitor; not something I was looking for, but a nice tool to have.
1477532528|2.0|The binding and paper quality are nice enough, especially for the price, but the text is riddled with bizarre typos -- for example, \\"surpeon\\" instead of surgeon, \\"haw\\" instead of \\"have.\\" Very likely the text was scanned from a hard copy without any proofreading before going to print. These typos do not occur in the various free online versions of the text.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Sort of like space invaders only different and better. Got this as free app but worth 2 bucks any day. I have this on my kindle fire.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This Is The Best Game I Got In My Kindle Fire!!! Its Worth 7$!!! I Love Building Playing Survival And More!!! I Especially Love Playing Multiplyer With My Brother And Being Creative Thanks Again For The Awesomest App In Here!! (:
B00785P2QC|4.0|this game is a lot of fun...its cool being able to run your own city and control everything. I deffinitly recommend this game
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I just really loved everything about this book. The entire concept of the silo(s) shows great, great imagination.  If you don't get the reason that there are no elevators, then you just don't get it.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I have all the other books in this series and was a little disappointed that this would be the last.  I liked how it ended even if some others may not have thought so.  Harris has done a great job with this series and I would and have recommended them to others.  Even though I really don't like the HBO take on this series, the books are quite good.  I prefer movies to follow the author's lead and not go off on their own take on them.  Instead, I continued to read the books and I am a little sorry that there won't be anymore.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Good characters and kept my attention through to the end.  Would make a great action movie it seems to mr
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Great story didn't expect the plot to turn the way it did in the end. Wish they made more like this one.
B003MOHX8S|5.0|I was sitting around heartbroken after a bad breakup (no I won't spill my guts on the internet, don't worry).  I stumbled upon one their songs on you tube and put pen to paper (nah she won't take me back).  Eventually I noticed I could listen to this stuff at ANY time, not just trying to win back the heart of the woman I was pining over.  This music is the soundtrack to life man! Like one of you wise reviewers stated you could listen to this doing anything, from homework, to wrestling a bear!  Want to zazz up cleaning up the house?  Throw this album on at high volume (preferably with good bass) and it instantly becomes an epic quest, a journey wrought with strife, adventure, love, and mayhem!  Hmm, I think I need to cook a meal for the evening.  I need a good stereo and Two Steps From Hell...ladies and gentlemen, TO ARMS! =D
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Been listening to this for a week. This takes a few days to sink in and when it does it's incredible. Heavy, heavy and somewhat newer Sabbath which feels very original and unique but also captures the feeling and energy of the past. Straight-forward songwriting, the songs are worked out really well, songs are very diverse and there are no fillers. Tony is power chord crazy all over the place and he lays down a monster heavy sound in every song. There aren't layers and layers of guitar tracks like past albums but you don't notice it. Fantastic tube distortion while picking on \\"Dear Father\\" and \\"Methademic\\". \\"Damaged Soul\\" sounds very early Sabbath with a bluesy, basic, psychedelic feel and a really surprising awesome resonant Strat sound. \\"Zeitgeist\\" is being compared to \\"Planet Caravan\\". Drumming is good (something little heavier would have been nicer but very good), Ozzy does a great job. And these guys seem to flow again and connect musically which is incredible. At high volumes this will blow you away.
B00A83075M|5.0|Awesome, loved it !!  Although I do find myself now worrying about the effect my gaming over the years has had on all the poor characters.... then I remember its just a film lol  Highly recommend though.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|I really enjoyed this, so much so that I watched it twice in one day. Great movie all around and I would totally recommend watching it at least once.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Found a book that was a fast read even though predictable.  Didn't have high expectations and was pleasantly surprised with the outcome.  Great mindless read for the summer.
B002LANLDK|5.0|unlike 2 & 3, this movie brought it back to where 1 was.<br />good car action, a little romance<br />good storyline
B00466HN6S|3.0|Silly funny film, perfect for Easter for the kids, worthwhile adding to the collection ... just expect to be watching it a lot at Easter lol
B0090EJR1K|3.0|Pretty decent movie, but I can't see myself watching it again. Some really funny parts mixed with some seriously dull humor.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I saw the preview for this movie and decided to read the book first and SO GLAD I DID!  I did not stop reading this book from the moment I started. Pretty sure my kids were starving and my husband was confused, but this book was definitely better than I expected.
1577314808|5.0|This is a fabulous book designed to teach us how to focus all of our thoughts on the present moment, \\"NOW.\\" It is by living in the NOW that we are most productive, healthy, and spiritually centered.  It is from this place or point in consciousness that Eckhart Tolle teaches we can become more enlightened and therefore, more successful by living consciously.  I recommend this book to everyone on a spiritual path or anyone desiring to improve the quality of their lives.

B002MGGM9I|5.0|great writing and acting, well developed characters<br />great plot<br />suspenseful<br />i wish that i had made this movie i am not going to type another word
0812982622|4.0|Sometimes a bit hard to take, but I stayed with it and recommend it for Johnson's imagination (or truth?).  Another amazing debut novel from a writer receiving Pulitzer Prize for Fiction.  He is deserving.
1451695195|5.0|How many of us secretly hope and pray that there is something on the other-side?  This book is a wonderful book because it offers hope.  And hope is a very necessary commodity in this day & age.  I thought the research and information was very compelling, and to hear it from the point of view of a neurosurgeon helped me to enjoy it even more.  Most of all because the book was so well written, it helped me to remain open-minded and enthused thoughout!
1582701709|3.0|I'm going to give this a 3 star rating because I'm one of those that wants to take the in between stance on this book.  There are both positive and negative aspects about it.  I'll start with the positive.  This book is very easy to read, a child could read it and it's message is very clear.  I like stuff that puts things simply.  It didn't take me long to get through it due to its simplicity.<br /><br />Secondly, I do like ideas in this book about focusing on the positive.  I do believe that people who strive to be more positive will often do better in life than those who don't.  Even if one things positive but struggles through life at least they were happy going throughout life.  Negativity can really hold some people back so there I believe there is a degree of truth to the book.  There is a law of attraction which I can't deny as I tend to attract people who are similar to me when it comes to friends.  People with like beliefs will visit religious ceremonies that are a like.  It is kind of a logical concept.  I don't agree with the degree the book takes this concept, but it is there.  Being positive, loving others, and believing that you can succeed will all help drive a person to success.<br /><br />OK, now for the negative.  First, while I like the simplicity of the book, it is extremely repetitive throughout.  By the time I read the first few pages I basically could predict the advice the book was going to give in other chapters.  It probably could have been condensed into a 20-30-page book.  Or, perhaps it could have given more information such as how does one go from being negative all their life to thinking positive.  A person who has struggled with failures all their life isn't going to just simply switch and start thinking everything is butterflies and dandelions after reading this book.  Going from negative to positive can be a long process, just as being able to learn to love and accept yourself can be a long and hard road.<br /><br />Let's take a brief look at the content and theories presented in the book.  Like I said, the book goes to the extreme.  It dismisses the idea of hard work or putting forth effort to achieve your goal.  We can ask, believe, and receive, but without the strive part we will more likely fail.  Yeah, there are a lot of testimonies in the book of people all of a sudden receiving money and on and on but I have also seen this approach fail with others.  The book is based off testimony, some logic, and very little science.  Yeah, they may talk about quantum physics a little but even that is a rather iffy subject in and of itself.  I have never known a person who has achieved their goals without putting some kind of effort forth.  I haven't seen checks all of a sudden start showing up at people's houses who are positive.  Then think about third world countries.  Are the children their starving to death because they are not having enough positive thoughts, or are they starving for other reasons?  I very much doubt the Universe is going to starve 5 year olds for their negative thoughts.<br /><br />Frankly this book doesn't reveal any \\"secrets\\" that aren't reveal elsewhere.  There are many better self-help books out there that you could spend your time reading.  Not sure why this one got as much hype as it has but I can't give it any more than 3 stars.
B009NG1Q96|4.0|It was a good series so far not one I would excess over but I enjoyed it a lot I probibly would recommend this to other readers who would enjoy this type of reading but that's about it
0307352153|5.0|Actually, I am still not finished reading this book, but I can tell you that I find it well researched and well written.  It is a powerful book and it has helped me to rethink my attitude about my own introversion.  This is not one of those books one finds in the self help section of the book store.  This book approaches the subject from a practical standpoint.  It is thought provoking and filled with wonderful examples that support the theories presented.  I have read &#34;outliers&#34; by Malcom Gladwell.  I am learning more from this book, however.  Thank you to Susan Cain!!
1616550414|5.0|I bought this for my little sister (not so little, she is 18) and it was more than I was expecting for the price: big nice book, good materials, nice presentations, impressive graphics on the inside... and I guess amazing quantity of info for fans
B00B7Y0206|1.0|It does not work on my Kindle Fire HD!<br />I get audio but no video. Also, it crashes and asks to register in order to remove adds.<br />Don't bother if you have a Kindle Fire HD.
030759565X|3.0|Well, once again I purchased a cook book with great reviews, only to find out it contains all recipes my family wouldn't eat. I cook easy, comfort food. With recipes like Black pepper & blue cheese gougeres I'm out big bucks!<br />There are some good old fashioned recipes in here - but not enough of them to justify the purchase.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I downloaded this after seeing my son playing. I'm sorry I did now cuz I can't put it down. Great fun and very addictive!
B003TU164W|5.0|They fit good and are very comfortable, the heel shock pad really works and they look even better than pics.
0425263924|4.0|Despite my gritch about the author stringing this trilogy out for 2 more bks, I really liked this one. Not as much as the first two, but still liked it well enough. It was kind of the smooth sailing filler before the next one. Yes, I heard SD's publishers wanted more sex scenes, LOL, and she sure delivered. OTT - over the top! Gideon/Eva hump liked rabbits all through the story. But despite that these two are FINALLY starting to learn to trust and get more confident in each other and I liked them together much better this time. Gideon is still too overly responsible with Corrine, but what the heck, there's the drama.<br /><br />Will I read bk 4? Probably not. I'll wait for the series to end. These series that string things out so long between bks loose me. I read a lot of bks, so many in fact when there are these lengthy waits I forget what went on in the last one and it takes me about a fourth of the bk for my memory banks to kick in. (What? Someone was murdered in the last one?) Too much work. I should probably go back and re-read the earlier bks but that's just too much effort I'm not willing to give for this series. Seriously, if you've not read this series, WAIT. Hold out for it to end and I guarantee it will be much more enjoyable to read them back to back.

B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Cute and addicting! A great time waster and adorable to boot. I love that they bring in the characters from the movie.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Awesome book...can't wait to read the next book....I hope it has a prefect ending because I'm rooting for Gideon and Eva.....
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|this is an awesome game of adventure you get to great hour own land and fight in battlte bottom line is you should totally get this game.I lovedthis game and bet anyone my agewould love it to! !!!!!!!
B00008973A|4.0|I've read in former Amazon reviews that this movie - based on the original Broadway play - does not capture the magic of the live stage experience - but unless you snagged a video of that theatrical experience, what are you waiting for?  This movie version captures the essence of the play, the earnest desire and need of the hopefuls to land a role doing what they do best: sing and dance in live performance!  Here we can enjoy in up-close performance beloved numbers like Everything Is Beautiful at the  Ballet.  Even better, lyrics and music by Marvin Hamlisch added the gut-wrenching opening song I Hope I Get It to swiftly clue us in what's at stake here: it's more than a job, and they want it so badly!  The the pacing and dance numbers are great - straight through to the full case flash dance of \\"One\\" (Singular Sensation) at the very end.  Michael Douglas is perfect as the dominant puppet-master/director - you feel his power and sex-appeal - and the underlying story of him, former stars now company hopefuls, and the casting couch, still smacks of the real workings of theatre politics and the price we sometimes pay to play.<br /><br />Why not add this DVD to your collection and relive YOUR afternoons when you wanted a job or a date or a game so badly you felt the world held its breath while you hung on someone else's decision.  Human drama, set to song and dance.  Enjoy.
B00AECGQF2|1.0|I bet this game is amazing but it wont let me download.  &gt;:( it really stinks cuz I wanted to play it
B00C5GZKVQ|5.0|The app works stable. You can fly up and land.  There are machine gun and rocket launcher on your helicopter. The control is pretty well (I prefer to use joystick mode).<br />You can choise from three types of helicopters and three rooms for fighting.<br />But competitor is very skillful on high levels. I've given up on 17 level ;(<br />Hi, Developers ;) If it possible, I'd like to have a network play.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I will have to say I am very disappointed in this book.  I love the \\"love\\" between these two but the longer it drags on the more chance there is of screwing up between these two.  I keep waiting for Gideon to mess up with Corrine and I can't enjoy the book for this.  I hope he doesn't cheat on her.  I am through if he does, no matter what the reason.  Don't know if I will buy number four or not.
B00006IM9Q|4.0|While I normally steer clear of Greatest Hits albums, in this case, I made an exception.With 19 tracks, including the more recent song &#34;Maria&#34;, I was happy to find that all the songs I love are here, plus a few I wasn't familiar with. The remastering is pretty good. The sound is full, not overly bright or bass heavy. The tracks are limited and plenty loud but not 'brickwalled' as so many digital recordings are today. Even &#34;Rapture&#34;, with its heavy bassline and bright hi-hats, sounds just right. I recommend this collection to those looking for an introduction to Blondie, as well as those who, as I did, grew up singing along to these fantastic songs on the radio.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Great story  (albeitt bloody and barbaric) that I still can't stop reading! This series is not for the weak of heart or stomach. Fabulous characters and fantastic writing.
B000Q9ISSQ|5.0|Mr Bryson continues to use his wit to keep you turning the pages.  I read the book as we were traveling around Australia and many of the places came more to life because of his stories about being there.  I didn't get to see the Big Lobster but felt I participated in the cult when I saw the Big Rockinghorse.
B00005ASOC|5.0|I first saw this movie on TV.  It's a very heart-warming movie and I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to watch something uplifting.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|The scope and beauty of this BBC nature documentary series is unrivaled. If you are interested in nature and the mysteries of animals on this planet, this is a must have in your dvd library. Luckily, they have made it available at a reasonable price, so that normal people can have access to this precious material. I bought a used copy, but the condition was almost like new. The packaging is nicely done and makes you want to put in in a prominent place in your collection. This is one of those types of DVDs which you can watch over and over again and continue to learn more about the world around us. I appreciate the DVDs extras at the end of each DVD in which they explain how particular segments of the documentary were filmed. This was a major undertaking in nature documentary film-making, and I am glad that the BBC has given us this gift.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love these 2, poor Eva and Gideon can never get a break. It's always something :( Can't wait to see what happens next with these two in the next book. Thank you Sylvia Day for continuing to give us more!
B000ZP9PYM|5.0|My husband bought these crocs to use on a Eastern European Cruise trip. They are extremely comfortable and the closed design protects the foot. He is very happy with the purchase, and Amazon's price was very good. These crocs run large so I would recommend selecting one size smaller.
B000JLSM00|5.0|If you love John Wayne as I do, then you will love this movie.  Jeffery Hunter and Vera Miles are the comic dynomites in this movie.  Also Ken (can't remember his last name), superb actor and singer.
B001OQCV2E|4.0|The Russian pilot was so cute ... why did he have to die? I am a fan of post-apocalyptic films, and this does a good job in being frightening, as well as entertaining, Yes, of course, there are some weaknesses in the logic of some details, but overall, it's entertainment and certainly worth the time ... if you are a fan of the genre. I originally saw this in the theaters when it was released, and I wanted to have my own copy to watch every now and then. The special effects / computer generated graphics are spectacular and serve the plot well in making it more exciting. Turn off the lights, crank up the surround sound, and cuddle under a blanket with someone fun to hold on to for some excitement and entertainment,
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I was thoroughly disappointed on the LAST PAGE! Did I miss something? I want more! Would like to read more...
B005S9EJ46|5.0|The storyline of The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is very true to life if one is familiar with India and is more mature. Its plot is really delightful and insightful. It is a wonderful movie about love and courage, and how to deal with both the challenges and the pleasures of life.
B002K0WBYG|4.0|I love just about anything with Sandra Bullock.  I didn't know who Ryan Reynolds until this movie.  Although I love this movie, I only gave it for stars because it's kind-of predictable.  But I highly recommend it anyway.
B00190KZUU|5.0|Life is always a fable - One as you see it, a hundred more as others see it. All are true, all are fabrications and all equally insignificant.
B002XXPNXG|5.0|I had chance watching the first one of the trilogy, love the script some of them taken in one take, awesome, it looks like there is no improvisation. I will watch it again.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Great movie and an excellent addition to the Lord of the Ring series. It has a very good story line and outstanding special effects. Amazon always has a very good competitive price on Blu-ray, and with free shipping you cannot beat the price.
B006FE83U4|5.0|My sister told me once that she wouldn't watch this movie because of the sad part concerning the black guy.  I told her that was the stupidest thing I'd ever heard.  It is such a great movie that any sad thing that happens is for a reason and a teaching tool.  It's such a classic and writing a review can never do enough justice for this movie.
0140274111|5.0|I received my book on time and in good condition. Very happy with my purchase.  I orginally read Breakfast at Tiffany's in a copy just like this one and enjoyed it so much I wanted a similar copy of my own. Very happy to have found it.
B000LTAY1U|4.0|I'll keep it short and simple the watch overall is great in design and look. only thing I'm worried about is the fact the water resistance is very low, so I hope I don't ruin it before enjoying it completely. I love the canvas strap, and the green face on watch.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|I am not a movie theater person so I couldn't wait to get my hands on this DVD.  I watched it tonight and am so thrilled to report that this movie is every bit as good as the hype and I can completely see it being a classic in 75 years from now just like the original!!  The script, the actors, the CGI, everything is completely spot on.  I have subscribed to Entertainment Weekly since it's debut issue and have never disagreed more strongly than with the suggestion that James Franco was miscast in this role.  He IS the movie!  He takes you on this ride that you can completely believe!!  He is not going to win the Oscar, but I totally believe that his name will be  attached to this movie in the way Judy Garland is attached to the original!  He was phenomenal!!<br />Mila Kunis completely embraced the role of the Wicked Witch of the West in an original yet respectful way.  We never got to see the Wicked Witch of the East in the original, but I can't see Evanora wearing those socks!!  My feet would do the shrinky-dink too caught in those suckers!<br />Overall, I can only hope for a sequel!!  Hollywood is not uninfluenced by box office, so I am sure we can expect it.  I only hope it can live up to the high standards set in this film.  Although, it is Disney - home of Aladdin 2, Cinderella 2 and 3, and Bambi 2.  OK, depressed now.
B007GE2H3G|4.0|Movie is really fun for &#34;kids&#34; of all ages.  Watched over Amazon prime. Our only complaint was the excessive buffering while watching the movie.
1449433251|5.0|Bill Watterson's  Classic Calvin and Hobbes Comic strips are All collected in these three volumes that are head and shoulders above their hardback counterpart. The main problem with the HB books was the binding that Didn't hold up very well. These are bound really well. If you LOVE Calvin and Hobbes, And Who Doesn't, this set is a MUST HAVE for your home Library.

B003730LRY|5.0|I've always loved this movie, it's not high drama or full of amazing special effects, but it's great for a night of popcorn and laughs.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This is an excellent book that I have already suggested to 5 other people. Read it and think about it. You won't be wrong. I thoroughly enjoyed it and will read it again.
B00BTHWFBK|3.0|I love Sabbath.  Going to see them this summer.  Love Ozzy solo.  Love ANYTHING Iommi is involved in.  I am grateful to have a new recording from Sabbath and been listening to it in the car over and over.  I \\"like\\" it.  That all said, why is it that it is the SAME EXACT RIFFS from their biggest songs on here?  Soooo obvious.  With that said, it just seems, I don't know, lazy.  Just put in the same riff, new words, BAM, new album.  I like most of the songs, because I liked the originals.  The Devil You Know is a FAR better edgier album than this, though.  Every Dio/Iommi album sounded fresh.  Makes me think that Dio was better suited to be with Iommi at this point, and Ozzy was better off solo.  This album sounds too recycled.  I like it, but it's lazy, and I would like to have heard them branch out and do something new and different, rather than them basically just playing old songs with new lyrics.  Still, I'm happy to have it, and it is worth adding to your library.  Thanks.<br /><br />Addition 1:  Just want to say I have listened to the cd a few more times, and I feel pretty much the same way.  The first 3 songs are the best.  I think my favorite song is Loner.  Why? It sounds exactly, I mean EXACTLY like Sabbath Bloody Sabbath - right down to the OH YEAHs like Ozzy does on the Speak of the Devil album during the song.. I love Sabbath and love their sound and like this cd - but MAN they didn't go into unchartered territory on this - same riffs from past Sabbath songs.<br /><br />I understand it is a fine line - if it was totally different people would complain and say \\"That's not the Sabbath I know\\" - but I think they should have mixed more new type sounds in as well - half classic Sabbath - half taking a chance.  The Devil You Know, like I said, is a better Sabbath album - RIP RJD!<br /><br />Addition 2:  Just want to add that the songs on the bonus cd, including Naivete in Black, for whatever reason - are a little more original and very good - they were more daring on those songs.<br /><br />But I'm happy to have the cd - it is the first Ozzy Sabbath cd/album I ever bought on the day it came out because I was too young when Ozzy was in Sabbath - literally a baby when their first stuff came out - Speak of the Devil is the ALBUM that made me a metal head.<br /><br />Next Sabbath cd comes out?  I'll be there day one to buy it.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|I would give this zero stars. I'm sick and tired of these  idiots making minecraft parodys. It makes me want to scream and cuss at them all day! Anyway, the game isn't good! I'm gonna email Mojang and ask them to sue all these people, if they haven't been sued yet!!!

B00634GHJA|5.0|What a great app for photo transfer from my iPhone 5 to my Kindle Fire! So easy !!<br />I am 61 years young and have ten grandchildren so lots of photos to take and share on FB!!
1423165691|5.0|I'm a huge fan of sketchbooks, the rougher the better. This book is great because there's next to no text, just beautiful drawings of some of the most classic characters Disney has to offer.<br /><br />As a former animation student I still have a love for all things pre-production and this book doesn't disappoint. You get to see the creation lines, break downs, and even eraser marks sometimes which is amazing to me. You really get to see the thought process behind the characters and how they were made.<br /><br />No shiny paintings or final post production shots here, nothing but black and white sketches that should delight any animation student/Disney fan.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|I loved the Dark Knight comic series of the 80`s and I really enjoyed this adaptation of the story. It has everything you`d want in a Batman story and more. A perfect set-up for Part 2 which will blow the top of your head off....

B004SJ3AXI|5.0|These games are the best games ever.  So much fun and it's an easy way to release some tension and ease stress.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|not as fun as the original but fun none the less.  You must have a facebook account to play though.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|One of Connelly's best books. It is filled with twists and turns as well as interesting characters. Have some fun and read it.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|I guess I like it as I wanted to read all the others books coming after.  Its been too long ago to recall exactly what went on in this book
0515153656|5.0|Just started reading the Jack Reacher series. Previously I read and enjoyed The Affair, which is a prequel to Killing Floor. Lots of mystery and twists and turns. Be prepared for some gory action.
B005K17RU0|5.0|It's a nice little app that works perfectly. I like that you can view the weather by the hour, the day, or the week. I also like how I can slide between each &quot;tab&quot; (hourly, weekly, map, news, etc) without loading a new screen. Very quick and easy!
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|I loved the way that each song was remixed and the singers sounded so much like the original singers.  I especially like &#34;More than words can say.&#34;  I like this version much more than the original!
B000FCKGPC|5.0|It has been quite a while since I read this one.  I liked it but I'm not sure if I am remember all that has gone before.  Most of my favorite people have been killed; I don't know what happened to the youngest boy and what wl happen the boy who was crippled when he gets too big for Hodor to carry.  Also what about Sensa & Arya?  & Jon Snow?  It sounded like he was at deaths door from what I can recall.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like the ability to change the looks of the cards and ease of use.  Fills lots of time without using a lot of brain. Great past time:-) . And it was free, Good game great graphics.
B00BTHWFBK|3.0|Its good. Not going to be disappointed if you buy it. But its also not the \\"knock your socks off\\" album i hoped it might be. Just for the fact that many bands cant get back together and make a great album anymore, (some reviews on here say no one else has done it, Devo's album from a few years back proves that wrong, i think it may be Devo's best album ever in fact, and Men Without hats just did a good new album as well although this is probably the wrong crowd for that; but regardless it is still rare), its worth picking up.<br /><br />The solos are great, but not memorable. (Technically Im sure they are masterwork, but they dont stick in your head or make a good \\"song\\"). Nothing is really wrong with Ozzie's voice (he cant hit some of those old notes). But they layer some effects on him that he has had to use these past years that just make him sound like Ozzie from his solo days more than Ozzie from his Sabbath days. And even with more listens, i just dont think any of the songs are as \\"classic\\" or catchy as their old material. I am not sure what i would take from here to put on a \\"hits\\" record? It sounded more like Ozzie jamming with a band than Sabbath getting back together to write a great full album. So im not bowled over by the album like I was hoping to be. Overall a good effort, im glad it was made.<br /><br />I will also say packaging wise I was VERY DISAPPOINTED that i got the deluxe edition and it puts the few bonus songs on a separate different disc!? What is this 1992? Who will put in a separate 3 song disc? At best i will make MP3s of them and never take that disc out again... You're telling me I paid more yet you cant press a special deluxe disc with all the songs on it in 2013? i can do that on my home computer - That's nuts and a HUGE waste.

I'll just leave it at this, our family (and a lot of our friends) are done with Disney. It's bad enough to shell out the fortune that they now want to get into their parks, they want all your cash and won't even give you a parking space once your there, they want cash for that as well. But now, after this fiasco, I'll never give them another dime! No parks, no Blu Ray, DVD, natta, zip... I would also suggest that everyone boycotts ABC and ESPN. They've shown everyone what they think of the working class, let's let them know what we think of them.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I could not get interested in the people in this one.  I guess I don't remember very much about it.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|This is great fun. I was happy to see the pilot. And William Shatner has Captain Kirk's character down from the first show.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is very addictive and is always changing by adding new prizes and scenery. I love this game and hope you'll get it too.
B002ZG999U|4.0|this movie is like the ones from the late 80's bullets flying everywhere an bad guys falling by the hundreds ,and no good guy dies. Is for sure a guys movie blowing up buildings explosions fires everything guys like . An a hot Latin  lady .
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Can't stop playing! Very addictive. I have been<br />number one amongst my friends for three weeks! The extra lives that people send me help out so much.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|As good or better than I expected. Not just a rehash of what made them the best heavy metal band of all time, with many new ideas and innovative twists. Great sound quality, amazing musicianship, thought-provoking lyrics, will be played every day in my car for quite some time to come.
B00D3V5V7U|5.0|After the 2nd MGM Lion Roar on the original Wizard Of Oz movie, start up your Black Sabbath 13 album and you will find that this album kicks total donkey butt in every regard imaginable. If you disagree, then go back to your Bieber/Gomez adorned Tiger Beat mags and stick a can in your can receptacle already.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|I couldnt delete a video. It always started downloading again after i x it out. Very good for for just watching them. Better the tubemate for streaming, but if youre going to download i would choose tube mate. Just my experience with this app. Others say different.
0071771263|2.0|Not really happy with the book. ETS is extremely lazy, so they do not provide real level of the TOEFL test. Thus, if you prepare only using this book, be ready that the real test will be much harder!<br /><br />Also there are no time limits for each section, especially for listening, and no CD with a computer version of the test, so you have to guess what time you will be allowed to answer test questions.
B002C4YYEU|5.0|Like Forest Gump, but much stranger.  Fun movie.  If you can get out of reality, it is a pleasurable distraction.
