B001OQCV6K|4.0|I find these new Sherlock Holmes movies to be smart, well produced, action-packed, and with actors who act well enough.  The blu-ray is crisp and visually pleasing.  Would be nice to get more behind the scenes stuff, though.  Recommended...
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I heard about this book on another website about books people have read and I had never heard of this author before but this book was awesome! I was unsure what Abby`s past was going to be about but once you got a chapter or two into this book you can`t put it down. Travis is one hot character he is mysterious and violent and his love for Abby is true to the core. I am sad it took them so long to admit to the feelings they had for each other! I can't wait till the next book!
B004EPYZV2|4.0|I'm not a fan of Tom Cruise and really only liked the first movie in this series, and rarely does a series of films improve over time.  So after the last two bombs I wasn't expecting much at all, but I was pleasantly surprised.  The story wasn't absurd and the overall aesthetic improved (especially over the slow motion Tom Cruise-a-thon's that the series became in MI2/3).  Good humor blended throughout as well.  Recommended...
B002UBRFDC|5.0|A true classic. I read this book after the miniseries premiered. It is a great read. Must  read for any serious reader.
B00BLGZN1S|1.0|I love WWII movies, This one had two actors who were in BoB and SPR so I thought they would bring something to the movie. Boy was I wrong.<br /><br />The movie just was just not really good. It didn't make sense and eventually, I turned it off before the end. Nothing to see here....move along people.
B005S9ELY4|3.0|For all its flaws this movie does have Sean Penn get the CRAP beaten out of him.  Yes, Josh Brolin opens up the ol' can of Whoop-Ass otherwise there really is nothing to recommend this film.
B009FZFONO|5.0|sorry i had to buy the show but it is worth it.. althought, i had problems with streaming in the 1.99 version.. the 2.99 hd did fine..
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I watched this in the movie theatre with my wife, and I watched it again eith my 14 year old son. It is just an awesome show. The suspense and the actions are just so thrilling, they keep you at the edge of your seats.

B00B7G3NFU|4.0|The Sessions deserves mention in a few areas ... Subject matter ... This is based on a true story ... Acting .... A great believable cast ... And courage .... To explore on screen a topic which would otherwise go un noticed by the great majprity of us. If you are looking for a drama that is compelling .... I recommend this movie.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I love this game! My 4-year-old son also loves this game! I really like the puzzle aspect of trying to figure out the best way to win the level. =)
B0091LS07E|2.0|I was so excited for a new Alicia album because her last two albums As I am and The element of freedom were 2 of the best albums I've ever heard from beginning to end perfection...you didn't even have to listen to them twice for you to really start loving the songs..it was just automatic music heaven from the first listen..this album was not like that at all. I would listen and listen and wait for a song to really grow on me just to be extremely disappointed. Don't get me wrong Alicia will still always be one of the best artists and performers ever; I just hope she goes back to the old Alicia for the next album...tears always win and listen to your heart are probably the standout songs on here and they're both only \\"ok\\" songs so for them to be standouts is pretty bad. Listen to \\"try sleeping with a broken heart\\" and you\\"ll see what I mean. Still love u tho Alicia
0061978078|5.0|Lauren Oliver has switched things up for us in Pandemonium: every other chapter is written in the present (Now) or in the past (Then), both told from Lena's point-of-view. As soon as I saw this, I was very excited to start reading it. I love when books have multiple narrators, and this kind of felt that way. There was no confusion, you always knew which Lena was talking and what was going on. Doing this, I felt that the story flew without any hesitations - and there were so many emotions: very powerful moments and decisions. Oliver's words have a way of imprinting themselves on your heart... I felt Lena's struggles, not only within herself but with the elements around her too. I ached so much for Alex. I missed him more than I ever thought was possible. Such raw emotions and writing is a rare thing to find in a second book to a series.<br /><br />Then: We see Lena as she was when she was found in the Wilds. How she survived and the things that she had to learn. This Lena is scared and questioning whether or not she made the right decisions. She's also heartbroken and so lost without Alex. But her thoughts of him are what keep her going, sane and hopeful. Being in the Wilds is scary and tough. Lucky for Lena, she 'found' a good homestead with caring and experienced people that took her in - Raven, Blue, Tack...<br /><br />Now: We see Lena in the present, a year after she has entered the Wilds. There's a mission that has to be completed and her role is very important and pivotal to the story. This is where we also meet Julian.  And there are many other discoveries to be made - there are other people and worlds hiding and living within the system.<br /><br />At this point, this book, it is so crucial to know everything about Lena... it helps to prepare you for that unpredictable ending! Yes, it is a grand cliff-hanger! But one that I didn't mind at all and loved!<br /><br />Now, onto Requiem!!!
B0088XXCZ6|1.0|Fiona's apple tidal; when the pawn; and extraordinary machine are all in a class of musical genius and brilliance and def in the top 10 list in my head of the best albums of all time...but this...this...I don't even know what the f@#$ thiis is...and that's literally all I have to say about it. I obviously love her so you cant say I don't appreciate her music...I just don't understand the path she was trying to go with for this one. I tried giving it zero stars and it wouldn't let me......And what the F is up with the cover art? Just as ugly as the music; if you can call it that.
1419705849|5.0|in the beginning, they were trying to get a date for the dance. i thought it was funny when gregg tryed to ask every body in the school to the dance and all of them said no!!!!! i think you will love this book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This an awesome game to pass time. I love how the sounds are so realistic!<br />The best part is that this great game was FREE
B0053TWVDC|5.0|Thanks so much for this product!<br /><br />I am super happy for purchasing this! I have been wanting to see this movie since i was a kid, and my family would not allow me to watch it, so being 21 and living on my own it feels good to have now purchased this and watched it on my own, its in my collections of favorite horror flicks forsure!<br /><br />Thanks again, great quality and fast shipment!
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Amazing record. Love all the songs....very happy with it! He has a great voice. No problems listening to album with amazon. Saw him in concert last week and bruno mars is amazing!!!
B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|I saw Dr. Mosley's BBC documentary, Eat, Fast and Live Longer on the web. I was very intrigued about the diet so I ordered my first ever electronic book from Amazon for Kindle. Reading it was easy but I must admit I miss not being to flip and search pages like a regular book. I have begun the FastDiet and feel great. Three things I noticed: 1) My energy was greatly increased while fasting, 2) after breaking the fast the food tasted better than it had ever before, and 3) I could actually think more clearly than when I always had a full stomach and colon digesting food. The fast period is not painful or difficult. I exercise on my fast days. I now understand why anorexics feel so much better when exercising and having an empty stomach. One actually feels better emotionally and intellectually.<br /><br />I highly recommend the diet. I have only been on it for about 10 days so cannot say I see any amazing weight loss. I have lost about a pound and a half. To be honest I prefer the fast days to the feast days. I will continue this diet for about a year to bring down my cholesterol and triglycerides. I have never been able to control them with diet before. I will add an update later.
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|I used to love this game but then a glitches made me stop from collecting coins and made me restart.
B00991TCOG|5.0|The music is phenomenal! The person making the music is even more phenomenal! I have been watching her videos online for almost a year now. Buying the album, was a no-brainer.<br /><br />The music is great. It is fun, playful energetic... Just plain pleasant to listen too. I love her videos too they are visually stunning, clever, and family friendly.  My three year old loves to watch her videos on my phone when she goes to bed, and I love that I can let me three year old pick Lindsey Stirling videos at random, with no fear that she will get an eyeful of adult content.<br /><br />As near as I can tell, Lindsey is her own label, doing things her way, which gives me some degree of confidence that the money I invest in her is actually going to her, and to furthering her music and career, rather than lining the pockets of intellectual property lawyers.<br /><br />I also love the way she has licensed her material, making it readily available for use by other musicians.<br /><br />Yeas, I bought this album as much for Lindsey as for the music itself.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|i have a kindle and this game is AWESOME I play w/my friends all the time the only problem is after having it for a couple of months it crashes and wont let me play so I have to delete it and re install it again:( :) otherwise I'm happy!!:D
B0055PGUYU|3.0|Definitely an interesting read. Lagged in some parts but overall good presentation of concepts. Some great examples were also noted throughout.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I enjoyed this book, although I must admit it lacks substance and probably will be forgotten shortly after it is read.  Great for a good escape from wherever you are right now.
B0089LOKHG|4.0|You must be open to the ending, closure is not always concrete and straightforward. Lovely feelings that this end book evokes, a sense of hope and certainty.
B000JMKNV0|5.0|Very few times in my life have I gone back to immediately re-read a book.  This is one of them.  I still have questions.  This would be a great book for a Book Club to explore.  The author weaves a haunting tale in which the reader becomes totally involved.  Eventually the reader comes to a &#34;but, wait a minute&#34; page.  Nothing predictible here.
B007MCTTHY|4.0|since this is in the top free shouldn't it be free. I was about to get it but saw there was a price. and I also see some good reviews. I really want to play this game
B0044C3RB4|5.0|I love this show it is so good.  I started watching it on Sci channel, but they took it off for some reason.
B000PXUA5W|4.0|Bought this for my eleven year old son and he loves it. I love that the band can be adjusted to fit his hand. Its is small but  I think it's just great for a kid.<br /><br />Will I purchase this watch again? Yes! I plan on buying one for my nephew and one for my niece.
159448385X|5.0|It's just as good as the kiterunner. It's a powerful stoy of love and friendship, but also very sad at times.

B004ZMWUCU|4.0|You can't help but feel very sorry for the main character in this book.  Those orphanages were horrible and I just can't even picture it.  It's interesting with the ending but some what unlikely.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I like the fact we finally got some info on what happend and what it takes to get the bad guys all over the world and commands respect for what they do sacrifice and honor.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|There was too much religion stuff that felt out of place in the movie.  It was not what I had expected.
B004UNX1LS|5.0|Really great. Ive used VEVO for a while now and their new update- &quot;Vevo TV&quot; will be great&hellip; I assume. Keep up the good work Vevo.
B001DEXDNI|5.0|I purchased this CD mainly for the Annie Lennox rendition of A Whiter Shade of Pale. I consider her version to be one of the better versions available. The Annie Lennox Collection to me is a good east listening CD of which I enjoy to relax with.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|THE GRAPHICS ARE AWESOME AND I also like how the cop is dressed like the Easter bunny and I like how you can do a Easter egg hunt

B004VMUS9G|5.0|Since I like to charge my iphone over night, I like that this will work, even when the phone is charging.  I used to always carry a travel alarm clock, so very happy I don't need one anymore.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|There is no doubt that Adele as a performer is ahead of her time.  I am one of those individuals that have purchased very little of the newer music in recent years since my library consists of music from the 60’s and 70’s era.  In listening to this CD, there is not one song that I would skip over.  This is a rarity since many artists seem to have a number of songs on an album that are not worth playing.  Adele has an awesome voice and this CD offers a variety of songs that keep the listener entertained.
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|I like killing time with Mahjong Titans on my computer, so I thought I would enjoy this, but they really have the graphics wrong.  It is hard to see on small screens.  Not worth the time to try.
B009FZFONO|5.0|great season opener,  many heads get smashed in as the group move to new digs,  can't wait to see who turns up next....
1476719071|5.0|I loved this book! It has some very intense moments that I see has caused some debate with other reviewers. I must say that young people sometimes act out of control, especially when love/lust is involved.<br /><br /> The book tells the story of a young girl named Abby who meets an older and disturbed co-ed named Travis. Abby, known as Pigeon to Travis, knows she should keep her distance from this bad guy who seems to exemplify everything she tried to leave behind. She loses a bet and then finds herself having feelings she can not escape.<br /><br /> I will admit that Travis did scare me with his behavior but I think the author was able to capture the true essence of a young \\"bad\\" guy in love! Travis is a beautiful disaster! I can not wait to read Walking Disaster and learn more about Travis! There were moments I loved Travis and other moments I hated him.<br /><br /> I was seriously in tears more than once for Abby because of what Travis was choosing to do. I loved Thanksgiving at the Maddox's! I could feel the love they had for Abby! It was a great read and I would recommend this book to anyone!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I've read a few of these books and this is by far the best book I have read. Keep a box of tissue nearby.
030746363X|5.0|I chose to rate this a five star accomplishment because it is spot on guiding to transform what can be accomplished through correctly applied science and thought.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Lots of good action with chase scenes, but the plot was so contorted as to be totally unbelievable.  For example M's order to have her agent shoot at Bond and the enemy espionage agent makes no sense since if she has been successful in killing the enemy agent, they would have gotten no info about the looted hard drive and it risked killing her best agent (Bond)---which it supposedly did, only to have him some back from the depths of being shot in the chest AND drowning.
B00A7Z8KAU|4.0|If you love drawing and like adding details then this app is for you. There's a little learning curve to it however once you get it down your for sure won't put it down. The only downfall is when you try to draw towards the top it wants to do something else and not just draw. Other wise this is a decent app.
B0084HJE0S|5.0|Excellent and concise update summary of what is available with HTML5, as well as what will be available with its use in the near future. In addition, the author explains how JavaScript will fit in and work 'hand in hand' with the HTML5 technology.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|Jimi's voice and guitar playing shine on this CD. It is amazing what they have done with these 40 year old reel to reel tapes. The sound is crisp and clear.  Many classic tracks with a slight twist. Some will argue these were rehearsal sets and should not be released. I beg to differ. As a college student, I listened to Jimi live at The Cafe Wha? in NYC. The true spirit of Hendrix comes through loud and clear without a lot of studio re-mixing.  I love it...
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|I downloaded the app and every time I load the app it goes to unpack and I really really hats it
B00BSBVLF8|5.0|Ok, first off, if you're watching this, the plot is very simplistic.<br /><br />Girl meets Boy at the local Circus.  Boy isn't quite the Aerilest he's promoted to be and falls through a hole in the floor.  Girl gets sucked into the pit as well, but she's still enamored with the Boy and spends the rest of the movie going through the various Worlds of Cirque Du Soleil to find him.<br /><br />It's that simple people.<br /><br />If you keep that concept in mind through the movie and don't over-analyze it, you will *love* this one!<br /><br />Other reviewers have said, this is the best of the best of Soleil.  And they're right.  It truly is a complilation of moments from some of Cirque's greatest works and well, well, *well* worth watching.<br /><br />But, if you've never seen a show of theirs before, it might seem a bit \\"mashed\\" together.  In some places it is.  However, Cirque is well known for the story underlying the aerobatics, music and costumes.  And if you keep the minimal plot above in mind and watch for the Girl and the Boy as it goes, you will enjoy yourself.<br /><br />The feats of strength, air-work and death defying moments set to some beautiful instrumental music will have your jaw dropping, heart pounding and leave you well satisfied with your decision to see this flick!
B006W0QR1S|3.0|I'd been wanting to see this video since seeing previews prior to it being released into theaters. The previews, and the movie trailer did NOT fully show what this movie was truly about. It was very graphic and was not what I had expected.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love this app! Its a great game, and it is very addicting. I like to play this game when I'm bored, or not bored. It has many different things in the game's store that you can buy for Barry. I would recommend this app to anyone who is seeking a fun game.
1932735410|5.0|This book does a great job of taking the information from the PMBOK and breaking it down in a way that is more easily digestible. It is full of useful exercises and practice questions. While I would not recommend only using this book to study for the exam, if you were to choose one book, this would be it.
B00846REIS|5.0|this a very exciting love story that is trying to bloom. there are many ups and downs. can't wait to finish the set.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Great camera bag, I can put all my lenses, cameras and accessories in it. Like the back-pack feature, easy to carry.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|i was so intrigued in the complete story. there were a few nights that i continued to read well past midnight.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|The entire album, beginning to end, is amazing! Most of the songs are amazing on their own but when you put them all together this album is very cohesive and just plain perfect.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|An amazing story of a women so strong and a faith so strong that by God brought to people together.
B002O1TMI4|5.0|Muse never disappoints! Their Radiohead inspired electro rock sound is pleasing as always and well worth the listen. Highly recommended
0142412147|4.0|I was originally intrigued by this book because I am a huge John Green fan, but after hearing a bunch of hype from my boyfriend I figured I just had to give it a shot! It's a wonderful book though! Disappointing that John Green's is the shortest of the three, but the other two authors are great as well! The only reason I give this four instead of five stars is not because of the product itself, but for Amazon's representation of it. It kind of seems silly, but the cover that they show on here was not the cover I received. There's nothing wrong with the the color I received, though I do like the look of the blue cover with the snow flakes, just slightly misleading. So, if you're purchasing from this particular seller for this particular cover, you might not get that. Also, it came with an obnoxious sticker on the front that left sticky residue on it. But again, minor things! Worth purchasing!
B006J3Y20Q|4.0|The Giver is a book about a futuristic utopia. The communities practice sameness in which every person goes through the same stages in life, with a certain possession to show their stage. They are unable to choose their own spouse, let alone have children of their own; a committee that tracks every person's volunteer hours and habits predetermines all this. Everyone sees in a gray scale, and the weather is always perfect. When Jonas reaches Year 12, the committee assigns him and all the other Year 12's to a career path. Jonas is skipped over till the end, when he is announced to be the Receiver of Memories; he is given all the memories of the past- wartime, love, Christmas, summer, a sunburn, etc. This shows Jonas that in order to fully appreciate what you have, you have to have lost something or experience heartbreak. Pain coincides with pleasure, and Jonas wants people to be able to experience these deep emotions and choices like humans past.<br /><br />This book is a very interesting read and it shows how much humans want to control everything in order to create something that they believe is perfect. It is a different perspective on how to ban biases and stereotypes in society by relinquishing the right to freedom of choices and being an individual. The cliffhanger at the end of the book allows the reader to decide for his/herself what the fate of Jonas is and the future of this utopia.

B008TRUDAS|4.0|I read her book Hopeless a few months ago and I loved it!! I started looking for a new book to get into and decided to read another book by Colleen Hoover... I was hesitant because  I'm not really into poetry but I was hooked after the first few pages!!
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|The graphics in this are wonderful.  The plot is inspirational and the funny bits are really funny.  The pacing is a little slow in places and the lead in to the main conflict is so predictable that a six year old could see it coming (um, be careful what you wish for when dealing with a witch/genie or other magical figures), but this is a really really good movie.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Yes awesome possum and the info in kaleidoscope have increased. Atvi and should not have increased dramatically improve your own site.

B005GFPZYK|5.0|Good book. The author not only discusses his own personal war experience but also how it affected him and his family.
0525423656|2.0|After coming across various reviews and tweets raving about this series I just had to get my hand on it. I waited for all the three books in the trilogy to be released before starting on it and only recently finished reading them.<br /><br />The second book starts a few months after where the first book ended. Cassie has spent a few months in the outer province looking for Ky. Her journey slowly takes her over miles and miles, guides by Xander's and her grandfather's messages. She hears about a rebellion, a rising against the Society and slowly gravitates towards it. She is once again united with Ky but only to make a tough choice that may as well part them. Unexpected bonds formed and unexpected betrayal mark the journey of these teenagers.<br /><br />I must admit that it was an enchanting dystopian world that Ms.Condie has created. The detailed description of how the Society worked spanned over all the three books so that every time you pick up a book, you learn more about the Society.  I have heard that the concept of the Society is lifted from a Lois Lowry series, but since I haven't read that series myself, I don't know if that's true. You guys might wanna check it out for yourself.<br /><br />The characters are pretty well developed. Cassie, the protagonist, comes across as a confused girl at the beginning. But then as the story progresses, her character develops and you realize that being under the Society's control all her life, a simple mistake from the seemingly perfect Society can throw a person off balance. I liked Ky too for his brave heart. But I loved Xander the most. Why do the best friends, the most caring soul, get left behind by the girls? Don't get me wrong but even Ky is a good guy too, but Xander was such a sweet heart. I was glad to see that there was some hope for him in the end.<br /><br />My problem with this series is that it was very slow. None of the books are less than 350 pages (I think the last one was over 500 pages). But when it comes down to it the plot isn't that complex to need three books. As a result I had the drag feeling throughout the three books and it felt really tedious to complete the series. As a single story with a faster pace, I might have enjoyed it.<br /><br />Overall, I don't think the books have much to offer.es down to it the plot isn't that complex to need three books.

0062238868|4.0|I generally don't read reviews of books until after I finish them. It allows me to form my own opinion. So I read pretty much every two star review. I picked two stars because they were somewhat more intelligent reviews than one stars.    There was a common theme within them that I absolutely agree with. The book is written poorly. Well, by all accounts if I were an English Composition professor I would probably give the book a D on a good day in light of Mr. Kyle's service.    However, the format in which the book was written says a lot about the mindset of Chris Kyle. The book has anecdotal stories of his service, and he tells them as if he were speaking to the reader from memory. I enjoyed this, and I expect every auto-biography style to be different in this respect. It provide an individual sense that separates his book from others like Luttrell and Bisonette.    Since his clearance requires pre-publication reviews rather than redact (ala Gary Bernstein in Jawbreaker) classified during the review it likely lost much of the context that would have pulled the stories together properly.    Overall, I'm glad I read this book and formed my own opinion of it. Chris doesn't mince words, his attitude and opinion is straight forward and no bulls***. He isn't the type of person that puts a filter on the thoughts that he turns into words. That garners an immense amount of respect from me, and likely he found the same from his peers.
B007THA4FI|5.0|I am STUNNED that this book has gotten so many bad reviews!  I found it to be utterly moving and memorable.  There are no magic spells, but the author who created Harry Potter is certainly evident!<br /><br />So it is not about magic. Rather, it is about community, and the struggle of the more privileged or stable community members to relate to or empathize with those left behind in society.<br /><br />When I bought this book, I didn't realize that. I really didn't know what I was in for.  I hadn't read or listened to any reviews.  All I knew is that it was Ms. Rowling's first adult novel and allegedly very different from Harry Potter.<br /><br />Oh, boy, is it!<br /><br />Now there is a similarity in her prose that is hard to ignore.  She had a way as presenting people -- characters -- as in the reduced form of their most predominant characteristics that I found very similar to some of the characters in the Harry Potter series. And I do love her characters.<br /><br />But here -- most of the characters are rather despicable.  At first, I thought I was in for a long story about despicable people, I didn't know what I was getting into.  But she takes her time in letting the reader see how remarkable Barry Fairbrother was, and how his absence will affect so many people.<br /><br />I do remember a headline of one review -- it said that \\"poverty informs Rowling's first novel for adults.\\"  Or something like that.  And how true it is. I wasn't fully prepared for the ending, or that fact that it is a story, a commentary -- and as in real life, the powerful people don't change, and the good people don't win.<br /><br />In that way this book is NOTHING like Harry Potter.<br /><br />I was bawling through the last chapter. I am a sensitive person, but honestly, I just didn't see the end coming.  I really wish I were a member of a book club these days, so that I would have someone to talk to about this stuff!
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|I pre-ordered this movie and it came the day it was issued for purchase.<br />My grand daughter was deeply in love with the movie and she could not wait to have it.<br />The fact that it came so rapidly was a big surprise and I am going to pre order confidently from now on. Five stars for the seller.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I am only dissapointed that I am broke, and must wait till payday to download the next installment. But I will. And it pains me.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|When I first started reading this book I thought I had accidentally bought another twilight-esque teen novel about a girl who becomes obsessed with a layered and emotional boy. I was pleasantly surprised. I didn't see most of the twists in this book coming and couldn't put it down! Other than it being completely engaging it was also heart breaking and intense. It's a great book to escape into for a little while.
B0096HFOZO|5.0|I love this book<br /> This is one of my favourite books. This book is very funny this book is about two very mean people one person's name is Mr.Twit and the  other one is Ms.Twit
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I enjoyed reading Sky and Holder's story.  It was such a sweet, painful, heartbreaking story. One twist I didn't see coming at all, the other I suspected.
B002WJI658|5.0|With a rough little boy toting him around everywhere, even used to act out his imaginary battles, Waluigi has shown no wear and tear.  Although his face scares me, my son loves this little stuffy.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I read this book all the way through it the first day I got it. A terrific book that covers more than just the program but covers why it works. I recommend this book to any one wanting to change the way they workout and live their life.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I hate apps that have too much going on. There is not too much going on our too much clutter. I like it.
0307341550|3.0|Good stuff and quite macabre.  I recommend reading this.  Sick and twisted, just like so many of her books.  Gone Girl still reigns supreme.
B00051E906|4.0|I bought this detector to check some vintage tiles in my house. This one is fine for that purpose. I didn't have much money to spend and needed something simple to operate. It's a bit flimsy, so you have to be careful not to drop it, and you have to give it several minutes to complete its surveys, but other than that I am pleased and glad I purchased it. Be prepared...the instructions aren't very good. They are in very poor English. There is a tutorial for this product on Youtube , and that helped.
0307341577|3.0|A good read, but nowhere near as good as GONE GIRL.  That is a must read!  I still liked this book.
0802473156|5.0|Very relaxing reading with little bit funny but in full context is this book very helpful for engaged couple. I recommend it
030758836X|5.0|So clever, where to begin!  I love this book and I recommend it highly. Twisted and brilliant prose.  She is a great writer and this is Gillian's best book yet.  A must for those who read!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I can see why this book has gotten so many positive reviews. The story -is- very compelling. I've read some of the negative reviews and it all really comes down to opinion. The things people found negative about this book really didn't apply to me. So the only way you can really know if it's good or not is to read it yourself.<br /><br />The setting is interesting, the issues are interesting, and the story isn't ruled by its own background. It's very character-driven, which makes you give a damn about what happens. Or at least made ME give a damn about what happened. I gave it four stars because I think that's what it deserved. A good book. One did not regret reading and was very pleased to read.<br /><br />The end.
0547848412|1.0|To me, the book is neither spiritual nor uplifting. Why?<br /><br />Pi tells two stories. One is true. Another one is false. (Or maybe each of<br />them is false, but the two stories can not be true at the same time). Even<br />if they look similar, nevertheless one of them is false. Can the false story<br />go with God then?<br /><br />As a Christian, I do not understand why one should believe in God after<br />hearing the story? Why does the first story go with God and why can't<br />the second story go with God? What's wrong with it? In Christianity God is<br />omnipotent, omnipresent, and omniscient. Pi follows several religions, but<br />where is Pi's God in the story? Pi speaks like an atheist who thinks that<br />believing in good stories means to have faith. His phrase \\"so it goes with<br />God\\" can mean that God doesn't really exist. It's human beings who created a<br />good story so that they could cope with the difficulties of life. Then it's<br />easy to understand Pi's words \\"After hearing my story,  you will believe in<br />God.\\" So it's not a story that makes us believe in God. It says the<br />opposite: God is nothing more than a story that people want to believe<br />because it makes their life more interesting, easier, and tolerable.<br /><br />As for Pi, his character and his belief do not change, he<br />does not grow spiritually at the end of his journey. Therefore, he is not a<br />spiritual teacher, but the same naïve believer. That's why, in my opinion,<br />\\"Life of Pi\\" is neither spiritual nor inspiring. It's a mind game, not a<br />true spiritual journey.<br /><br />Anyway, Pi can believe in whatever he wants. He can assume that one of his<br />stories or even both of them can go with God. Nevertheless one of them is<br />true, another one is false. Which one do you prefer? As a Christian, I do<br />not insist that other religions are totally false. Probably, they have their<br />own truths. But I believe that only one religion is uniquely true. So I want<br />to choose the true story, or at least the one that is closer to the truth<br />than the rest. But it seems that Martel doesn't want his readers to choose<br />the truth. He recommends them to choose a nicer story.
B0000542D2|5.0|After seeing &#34;The Beatles&#34; on Ed Sullivan, I was hooked. When the movie was in the theater, I was considered too young to seeing that kind of music. In reverie, it was right. Who could have heard anything? Years later, it came to TV and I was in raptures.<br />The movie was very urban considering no one treated them as particularly urban. Nice suits, hair cuts and future, their cheeky flirting with high school girls was non-sensual. So it's a day in the life in what this new group trying to get to the theater on time with baggage in tow.<br />The music is classic. Very clean, but with catchy chorus. It's, again, safely sensual.<br />My kids love the music and movie, too, though they liked Rubber Soul and on.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Definitely will be reading more of Nicholas Sparks books. Great writer makes you want to read from start to finish and not put it down.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|Almost all the songs on this album are earworms. There are a couple of duds, but most of the time you get more duds than hits. This is a great album.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have every John Grisham book and this was my first kindle purchase of one of his books.  It was as always a great page turner and I found myself finishing it before I wanted to!
B00BHMETKC|3.0|It had a bit of tension toward the end but doubted the last minute chase.  I was curious what the mix was of fiction and fact.  Guess I'd have to read the book(s) about the incident to compare.  I would guess it to be the worst best picture that I have ever seen (Chariots of Fire actually put me to sleep several times I tried watching it).
B001C1066E|3.0|So... I was excited when it arrived. And it is oka, but I did expect a little better quality! Some of the thread is shappy, and the eyes is almost falling off!! But of course if you glue that on it's fine :) It was cheap.. well sort of, the shipment was a little expencive!! But if you are a fan ^^ then you can work with all that.
B001RIY4WE|4.0|Though I can tell DTS-HD is better than Dolby, which sounds more clearly and louder. But I can't tell difference between 5.1 and 6.1. Maybe it's because I pay too much attention on the picture.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I like this app I have a similar app on my phone but this one is much better. Great forecasts I also like the fact that it has weather news
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I'm rather surprised how much fun this is and even slightly addicting. The graphics keep you riveted as the action unfolds, great attention to detail, catchy music and very entertaining. I highly recommend this game to anyone of any age.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|It works really well for an alarm clock for me I love all the features and its easy to use
B002EEP3NO|5.0|Got is for my huge Lego/Star Wars fan for his 13th birthday, he is going to just flip!!!! The price is nice, any kind of discount on a $400 lego kit is great! Free Shipping also saved me a big chunk of cash, thank you, and I'm sure my son will thank you as well!
B000YXMMAO|2.0|At the beggining of the disc, in the first track, something makes the needle jump and It cant be played properly nor hear the track.<br /><br />The rest of the disc is perfect, amazing sound.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love all the sound varieties and how each sound can have its individual volume raised or lowered depending on how clearly you want to hear it. great app!!!
B000002J6F|5.0|I bought this hot off the stamping machine in 1972, before the cool insert with tour photos and lyrics was invented. (Friends who bought it later showed me..) KING or one of the other Seattle area FM stations actually played \\"It Doesn't Matter\\" for a while but there wasn't a \\"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes\\" or \\"Carry On\\" or \\"Black Queen\\" here - there are 2 songs on each side that would make a dandy single but 1972 was one of the greatest years in pop music, when it wasn't one of the worst.<br /><br />This is far and away the best of Mr. Stills solo efforts, and ranks with the first \\"Crosby, Stills & Nash\\" record as a perfect collection of songs, one following from the other, a masterpiece, an encapsulation of a year, a feeling, the sound track of my life, in 10th grade when it came out, to, oh, yesterday.<br /><br />Chris Hillman, the Byrds dependable bassist and singer, and Flying Burrito Brother, plays guitar with Stills, and Al Perkins, an other escapee from the Burritos, adds pedal steel. Sufficed to say, plenty of guitars are on hand. Calvin Samuels, from the CSN&Y \\"Deja Vu\\" and \\"4-way street\\" albums, plays bass. He's not flashy but he can definitely be counted on. Drummer Dallas Taylor, pictured at the back door on the CS&N album cover, is also a familiar and trusted band-mate. Paul Harris and Joe Lala brought keyboard and Latin percussion skills. This is the funkiest and most rhythmic record Stills ever made. Just as good, its got the most Latin feel (Recorded in Miami at Criteria Studios) AND the most Country & Western content as well. \\"Cuban Bluegrass\\" is both a song half-title on side 1 and fair description of the second half of what should have been a single, \\"Both Of Us (Bound To Loose)\\". No, I can't imagine Crosby, Nash or Young doing the Afro-Cuban thing but Stills has no difficulty with it at all. This band was a powerhouse that could go off in any direction the players wanted.<br /><br />The tunes are divided into four suites, each with a rather self-important name, but heck, they work, so he's entitled. Side one is where the Latin feel is strongest, as noted. Side 2 is Country and Western (Both kinds of music - and they are different) \\"And So Begins The Task\\" is Western, not Country, one of Stills' 10 best all time songs, and could have been recorded by Bob Wills. \\"Jesus Gave Love Away For Free\\" is Country AND Western; \\"Hide It So Deep\\" is Country, and \\"Don't Look At My Shadow\\" is straight-up Honky Tonk.. Fiddler Byron Berline sounds wonderful on these songs.<br /><br />Side 3 is the everything, all the time, side - \\"It Doesn't Matter\\" is another of Stills' 10 best, country rock, stoic, not a great lyric but a transcendent tune and arrangement. \\"Johnny's Garden\\" nearly folkie, is about the gardener at the mansion Stills bought in London... from Peter Sellers. Sellers based his \\"Chauncy Gardner\\" character in \\"Being There\\" on this same gentleman, who sees to have impressed others with the merit of simplicity and clarity... an English Buhddist, if you will. \\"Bound To Fall\\" a hard blues rock with some of that late 60s Indian/middle-eastern-esqe percussion. Great singing, cool dead-stop/big echo ending. \\"How Far\\" is funky poppy medium tempo, er, product? Probably seemed like a good idea at the time. It fits well but isn't something I've ever sought out and started the record, CD or iTunes player at. Whereas, \\"Move Around\\" has some cool synthesizer keyboard stuff up front, and a lovely shift from major to minor at the end. \\"The Love Gangster\\" - hadn't Steve Miller already written that? was re-written with Bill Wyman of the Rolling Stones, from Stills' earlier \\"Bumblebee\\". It has an insolent, big-city feel, with funky wah-wah guitar and harmony vocals 100 yards deep. Who knew?<br /><br />Then there's side 4 - the 70s album oriented rock side. \\"What To Do\\" has great rock and country touches all over a positive invocation - \\"Do your thing, you know what to do / just don't let nobody tell you no lies.\\" All that beautiful hippy s&*^. With that out of the way, we get some nice minor key emotional stuff with the big guitar solos in \\"Right Now\\" The band is smokin' hot and lyrics about disaffection and lost love fit that perfectly. In a nearly Ramones-like 2:59. Whatever else you say about this album, \\"self indulgent\\" just isn't right. This is a concise and to the point collection. The big jam song is next and its all of 8:09, fully half of which is straight, earnest, 70s rock, and the second half is a lovely one-take jam by this very together band. Tasty. What the people want. For the encore, we get the acoustic guitar solo,\\"Blues Man\\", a song in mourning for Duane Allman, Jimi Hendrix and Al Wilson (vocals and harmonica for Canned Heat, he died of a drug overdose in 1970.) Its a sad song, in the midst of a particularly awful era of death and tragedy in pop and rock music.<br /><br />All together, well, 21 songs, one I'm not knocked out by, the other 20 I am. That's pretty good work, and far stronger than what followed. The truth of the matter is that Crosby, Stills and Nash wrote and played beautiful songs together, and had a musical chemistry which was a treasure for the ages. But add Neil Young and you can sell twice as many tickets. Stills, Nash and Crosby did terrific guest appearances with Young and his bands. Young wrote his weakest and least interesting music for CSN&Y projects, but played his incandescent solo material with them in concert. The Manassas record is what Stephen Stills would have done without the other 3. Its good stuff. It draws from all over the spectrum of American music. Its not much like CSN&Y or CS&N or Buffalo Springfield, because there are a lot of different voices from different traditions, and rich, complicated music. There's a lot to be said for Young's Crazy Horse thud-fests, and Crosby and Nash with a couple of acoustic guitars are a wonderful treat, but Stills could function successfully with danceable rhythms, with straight Country, Western and Blues roots forms.<br /><br />There's a Mickey Hart quote about watching Stills go around in a recording studio, using each instrument guitar, banjo, piano, to play part of something, and then using each facility within the studio to capture, enhance, blend, magnify, process or otherwise interact with the sounds of instruments and singing... and Hart says he realized that the musician needs to have faculties with the instruments but also with the recording equipment. You can't make a good recording without skills using both. So Hart knew he had to start studying. Well, this recording was just one stop on Stephen Stills journey. But its a real peach. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have, over the last 41 years!&*^.

B005GFPZYK|5.0|I purchased this book primarily because I was curious about this young hero who survived so many tours of duty but died so tragically at a shooting range in Texas not long ago.  It is a very good book that I feel is honest, sincere, and characterizes many of the young men (and their families) who serve and sacrifice for our country.  The sections of the book where his wife comments on his service and its effect on their marriage shows the problems our military men and women endure on and off duty.  It is especially tragic that he and his best friend died trying to help fellow servicemen deal with the aftermath of war (PTSS).  He left a wife and two children.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I bought this after seeing the movie. I really enjoyed it and wanted to be able to listen to the music whenever I desired.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Settlers is a classic game that rarely lets you down.<br /><br />This version of the game is designed for 3-4 players and can provide countless hours of fun.  The board and dynamics of the game change each time that you play (you shuffle up the board as well as the probabilities that certain resources are in play) so no two games are the same.<br /><br />It's a lot of fun!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Who doesn't like the WOZ? The book is just as good as the movie. I would suggest it be a must read for everyone.
B007VUA7VO|3.0|I like having a bigger, better reference of the battery life left in my kindle than that dinky little symbol and this one does the job just fine for me.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I bought this because it was only 5.00. Then I went and sold my paperback and hardback copies. I would rather have them on my Kindle. The books are better then the movie(s). I read them way before the movie(s) came out. They are so good. If you like Harry Potter and Twilight you will like these.
B00ABO573A|5.0|Great film, although full of Drama and suspense the characters portray our own realities. We may not be in relationships nor associated to drugs, each and every one of us, gay or straight battle with identity and purpose.
B00BKTWBMA|1.0|A disappointing offering that builds on neither the blues nor rock genius of this performer.  The tracks are mediocre renditions of old middle-of-the-road and country classics without an original sound to them.  For instance,  Willie Nelson's cover of [[ASIN:B00137KDVK All Of Me]] plays on Nelson's unique vocal qualities and chord progressions but Clapton's version sounds like the dozens of tired covers by so many others.  \\"Still Got the Blues\\" almost raises us above the mediocre with a soulful vocal but it is not enough to carry the rest of the collection.  As a long time Clapton fan, I really wanted to like this album but there were none of the memorable guitar licks or humorous and moving lyrics of the past.  Instead it seems just an uninspiring collection that I will not likely listen to again.
B001FSDOZO|5.0|This is a CD I replaced due to theft so I was pleased to buy it at such a great price. No scratches or skips! Works great. Glad to have it in my collection again!

B00B2V66VS|5.0|you should get this game because its way better &amp; hader than the first one :D.  Its fun just like when you have nothing else to do.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I liked it before.  It's gotten amazing with flow.  Needs better capitalization rules, but it's still awesome.  It's worth trying out at least.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Where to start...this series has it all,Great Story Telling,Fabulous Acting,Incredible Costumes,A Gorgeous Music Movie Score.There is intrigue,scheming,hate,lust,greed,heartbreak,<br />love and of course (some) Honor amongst the men and women.<br />I am an avid History Fiction Reader and lover of Movies in this time period.My husband usuallay dosen't like this style at all,but he is now hooked as well!We are now into the second season of GOT and if possible it's even better!Happy to have The third Season on Pre Order!Highly Recommended!

0064431789|5.0|This is a wonderful book and my daughter (who is two years old) loved it the first time we read it.
B0055MBQOM|5.0|I use this colormunki with my 2011 imac 21.5 and it does a great job. I simply just put it on easy and let the tool do it's job. Sure you could get more advanced and perfect the settings, etc. However I find that printing to whcc using the easy setting and the imac has been a great combo. They even recommended it under their color profile settings. Def better options out there i'm sure, but for a portrait photographer like myself, this has been a satisfactory combination.
B0027MJU00|4.0|I liked the book since it was different. It was almost too different though.<br /><br />Either way, I read it and I would definitely recommend it to a friend. Good read.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|great game great to kill time srongley recommended from me I give It 4 stars beacouse it needs more vehicles and stuff like that but it is realey good
B0051QIGP4|1.0|worst album ever. I only paid $1 for this thing and I still feel ripped off. Don't waste your money.
0143120530|5.0|The book is like a journey: Joshua Foer, begun in a journalism for the USA Memory Championship, attempted to figure out the capacity of the human mind and sought his way to improve his memory. Finally, he won the champion of the USA Memory Championship in the following year. In the book, Joshua Foer covered scientific basis of memory, the historical judgement of memory, and techniques to improve memory. Unlike other books about memory, with numerous boring scientific concept and terms, Moonwalking With Einstein contains actual experiences of Joshua Foer. Those experiences provides readers a more direct and funnier way to read the book. It is a book that will often make you stay up bedtime, since the book is so hard to put down.
B00AFEXRME|3.0|Spoiler Alert:<br />A seasoned commercial pilot is an alcohol and cocaine abuser(isn't alcohol alone bad enough?)<br />Prior to his next morning flight, he had a binge and sex with his much younger flight attendant.<br />When the plane failed, he conducted a miraculous maneuver and landed the plane with minimum<br />causality.<br />While recovering in the hospital, he met a female heroin addict and developed some kind of relationship.<br />With unclear reasons, once the addict met the pilot, she seemed to have kicked her habit.<br />To protect the pilot union, its officials managed to cover up the evidence of the pilot's blood content of alcohol/cocaine.<br />Only at the end, the pilot' conscience made him admitted his guilt.<br />This preposterous script is saved by Denzel Washington's masterful acting supported by a fine cast<br />including Don Chaddle, Bruce Greenwood and John Goodman as a colorful drug pusher and Robert<br />Zemeckis' expert direction.

B00947N6D8|5.0|This film is pretty much fun and entertaining, Rise of the Guardians had a sad misfortune of being a Box Office disappointment at losses at $87 million which makes it Dreamworks Animation's rare box office disappointment as the first unsuccessful financially since Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas despite a promotional selling that it would be a hard sell for very younger children and the getting of Santa being Russian with tattoos and swords with the makings of being the next How to Train Your Dragon and Award season buzz. It's much better than the critics say about it!<br /><br />I really wanted to see a sequel of this it had the makings of a franchise, it's a amazingly underrated film that they tried really hard to make this a brand new franchise. This film will go down in one of the underrated and under-seen animated movies like Treasure Planet and Titan A.E. and The Black Cauldron as a cult favorite in the next ten years.<br /><br />This is one the best Dreamworks Animation movies that has seen outside Shrek ever! Let us get out and buy this so we can still get the chance for a second film!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I LOVE THE ALIEN MOVIES, SO I HAVE TO GET THIS SPECIAL EDITION, AND ITS GREAT! TOTALLY RECOMENDED FOR ALL THE FANS OF ALIEN
B0034DGPEU|1.0|I was expecting a lot more from this book.  The subject material is rich enough to offer up a good story, but I found it very boring and annoying.  Bad things just happened one right after another without any cohesiveness. Most books leave me sad that I have finished  a great story, just like when my fav tv shows end, with this one I was happy that I had finally plodded through it and it was over.
B00540G3G6|4.0|I GIVE IT JUSR 4 STARS BECAUSE THE 3D EDITION REALLY DON'T HAVE A GREAT 3D EFECT LIKE I EXPECT, IMAGE AND AUDIO ALL RIGHT BUT NOT SO COOL VIEW ON 3D LIKE OTHERS MOVIES OF DISNEY

B00BHU2A7I|5.0|gives an inner look at Hitchcocks movie creation process and how he and his wife work as a team. I related to the banter between husband and wife as I tend to have similar moments with my other half. I recomend this for anyone who is a Hichcock fan. Anthiny Hopkins is amazing in this!
B00004WPAE|5.0|Great disc, high quality materials,  sound is very good...  I recommend to buy it, if you like The Beatles =)
B000PAAH3K|4.0|I enjoyed this book but not quite as much as the author's other two books: Tipping Point and Outliers. It was generally the same genre but the topic wasn't quite as intriguing to me as the others. The book discussed the importance of instant impressions in decision making and illustrated more than one example of where having too much information was more of a hindrance than a help. Gut instinct was often our subconscious and it often took our conscious brain some time to catch up. The book went on to explain when those instincts should be trusted and when thy should be ignored. Covered a variety of topics from speed dating, to police brutality. A very interesting book that kept me up late.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is so awesome .I play it every day and every night.it is so much fun,playing it,getting hit by the trains,and having a dog chase after me.So I SOOOO love playing this game.(((((:::::
B00992CF6W|4.0|I purchased this game for my son to play on his Kindle Fire HD. He had seen the game on some friends tablet's. He is 7 and enjoys playing the game. I think it is good for the imagination and spacial construction.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|The features would be nice if the photos were view-able.  Unfortunately none of the trouble shooting worked.  Having a camera where the photos disappear is useless.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|My son and my husband both loved to play the original Temple Run. When this one come out they had to have it. Great game for coordination.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great information that is well displayed via easy navigation. Always been a fan Of AccuWeather and now I have easy access.
B0090XOJAA|5.0|I absolutely love Mika's latest album! I ordered the French deluxe edition because, well, I love the French language and he just sings it beautifully. I love 22/24 of the songs on this album, which I think is great ratio. If you love Mika's earlier stuff then you'll definitely love this!
B0087GF8ZG|4.0|[[VIDEOID:moP3KV3Q69WV15]]This  8 LED Automatic Motion Sensing Night Light is very useful little light that can be used in many different locations and situations.<br /><br />Powered by 4-AA batteries (not included) the light features a motion sensor with 120 degree coverage angle. The combination light/motion sensor is sensitive to movement for at least 15 feet in my testing. If you place it in such a way that the sensor is not impeded by any objects, or in close proximity to heating or cooling ducts, the light will automatically turn on even when in a good sized room. The light will not activate when in \\"Auto\\" mode unless the ambient light level is quite low. It does not have to be completely dark, but there is no sensitivity adjustment, so placement of the light must take into consideration the particular lighting characteristics of the space where you intend to install the light.<br /><br />The light switch has three positions: off, auto and on. When in the Auto position, the light will activate when it senses movement within it's range. The light will remain lit for as long as the sensor continues to pick up movement. After 10 seconds of no movement, the light will automatically turn-off but will immediately turn on again if movement is detected.<br /><br />The light switch can also be turned to the \\"On\\" position to provide continuous light output, until you turn the switch back to \\"Auto\\" or \\"Off.\\"<br /><br />I've got my light installed in an attic space that has no electric service. The space is used for storge only and when I need to go up there, I usually have to bring along a flashlight. Now I don't because I've got this light installed on one of the rafters. As soon as I enter the space, the light automatially illuminates the area, I can find what I need and leave. No worrying about turning the light on or off as it's automatic. Love it.<br /><br />I wish the light had an adjustment that would allow you to set the length of time the light stays on when activated in \\"auto\\" mode before shutting off in the absense of movement. In my attic light situation, occassionally I'll be in an area where the sensor can no longer detect my movement and it shuts off after 10 seconds of inactivity. Well, I'm in the dark at that point so I have to go over to the light and turn the switch to \\"on\\" mode.<br /><br />The other wish I had is that it would be nice to  be able to adjust the sensitivity of the motion sensor. To have a more/less sensitive adjustment would let you fine-tune the placement of the light without having to worry as much about unnecessary activations.<br /><br />The package includes 2 mounting options:The back of the light has two mounting holes to accommodate screw heads. Included is a set of 2 drywall anchors and: screws. Also included is a small patch of nylon loop fastener.<br /><br />I was provided a sample for review.ivated in \\"auto\\" mode before shutting off in the absense of movement.

B007REV4YI|2.0|The latest entry to the James Bond collection is worthy of one viewing but probably not more.  It starts out with a great chase scene betwen Daniel Craig and a baddy and is followed by a very good theme song but that is where this movie loses its way.  It becomes disjointed and wanders until we get to meet the real villain , none other than Javier Bandem, Mr. Macho himself.  Remember \\"No Country for Old Men\\" where Javier's performance turned your spine to ice?  Well this isn't a repeat performance.  He is badly miscast as a gay baddy, who despite his best efforts never pulls it off.  Too bad, the way this movie was hyped you would have thought it was another \\"Casino Royale\\".  So much for hype. Oh, and I still havn't figured out how our hero,(with a high calibre rifle bullet in him) can fall 10 stories from a moving train into a river (head first) then go over a sizeable water fall and still be up and walking around in a short time???
B000IZA9PI|3.0|It's clear that the Star Trek film series has gotten off track with the final film in the Next Generation series. While it's good to have action in the Star Trek universe, it's not good to see it lose its identity via countless laser gun scenes that remind us of Star Wars. At various times, it felt like I was watching a Star Wars movie; the tone is dark, the premise is evil vs good, and action aplenty. To me, the latter isn't what this franchise is about. It's about exploring other worlds and using ones brain rather than brawn. Finally, being that this film came out in 2002, it's a CGI extravaganza, which for the most part is embraced. I also liked the special effects. However, the Next Generation franchise has run its course. I'm a bit fatigued by the recent movies paralleling one another, to the point of it seeming like one long 8 hour film. There was something missing in this film; I can't pinpoint it exactly. Was it a poor choice as to who played Picard's clone? Let's face it: this guy wasn't a bit intimidating. Still, this isn't a bad film--it just didn't gel the right way.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I love this game. The layouts are different and there are alot of them to choose from. You get chances to better your time, you can change the settings, background, tile faces. It is fun to play.
B00064WSNM|5.0|Starless and Bible Black (1974) is a most unusual album, in that it features 6 tracks that were recorded live, then edited in the studio. The first 2 tracks are studio recordings. One can't even tell that the last 6 songs on this album are live. This album is very progressive, and features an abundance of violin. It seems as if this album covers the entire musical spectrum. The album starts with THE GREAT DECEIVER, which is a bit punchy and choppy. Probably my favorite tracks (besides THE GREAT DECEIVER) on this album are THE NIGHT WATCH and the hauntingly beautiful and heartfelt TRIO. The album concludes with two extended numbers, FRACTURE, and the title track, both of which have the most progressive structures in them. While this album isn't as good as their debut album or Red, it can nevertheless hold its own, and I still give it 5 stars, as it's one of the best albums in the Crimson catalog. To sum up, this album has an artistic presence and beauty to it. Don't skip this album. 9/10
B004P8JPS6|3.0|Exciting, page turning, couldn't put it down.  But there was a major change in behavior of Reacher which presumably reflects a change in philosophy by the author. In particular, in all the previous books Reacher would only harm or kill those who tried to harm or kill him. In this book three of the victims had done nothing against him  Yes they were bad guys, but reacher acted as judge and jury. A departure<br />Yes, it's only a book, but still...
B003JTHXOK|5.0|An amazing ending to a great book. I had a really hard time putting it down! Kept my interest from beginning to end!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This is an awesome alarm clock. I'd recommend it love it. It will work even if the device is in sleep mode.
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|i like this author. his knowledge of crimminal investigations and how someone perseveres in spite of obsticles in his way. rebus mysteries on bbc were really my introduction to this author . i also like his use of music and names of musicians which i've checked out on i-tunes.
B00AUA67GQ|3.0|The handwriting recognition was the primary reason I purchased this app.  The only issue I have with it was that after awhile it would only convert my handwriting to all uppercase characters, and I could not find a way to get it to use lowercase characters.  If not for that, I would give it a better rating.<br /><br />It also updates to Evernote, but it would be nice if it would completely sync to Evernote, and not just push updates to new notes to Evernote.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|challenging and fun. I can see that I am required to come up with more words to submit this review
B004T4LUPW|5.0|Does a good job syncing with Google Calendar.  This was the most important feature for me.  Excellent features and behavior similar to Google Calendar.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I just loved the whole series. I was happy to have been able to see the whole season and was able to get a good back ground for season 3, which was wonderful! Can't wait doe season 4
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this is a all full of awesomeness and gives you the exact charge. with this in one click you can find your battery status
0670026603|5.0|The story is very well told and keeps your interest to the very end.  I would recommend it to anyone...
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|This game constantly crashed!  conveniently after I bought peanuts-everytime!!!  would not suggest this game, you get to a certain level and it would crash also!  I did love the game-me and my 5 yr old would play together-but got tired of it always freezing, or force closing, and just not working!  what a bummer!
B00AVTMCYW|4.0|I think this is a great movie. It had some depressing emotional moment especially towards the end and I Still would recommend it. Weather you want to rent it or buy it it's worth your purchase.

B00B23O96A|3.0|As a longtime clapton guy(I`ve got everything,plus bootlegs) I enjoy all styles of clapton music,pop reggae blues blues rock.But there is good and bad of all kinds of music,I loved the stuff he did with marsalis,cause he was pushed artistically and EC responds to that also it was basically recorded with a few mikes in the concert hall.Which is one of the problems Clapton has had beginning with Pilgrim,His mixes seem to more often than not have a glossed over feel with the vocals overcompressed and way upfront.Which seems to take the human element away.I see Simon Climie listed in the production credits and he mixed the album.Clapton should never use Climie again.Clapton needs to take the blame also.I think the effort is there,but he`s misguided.I don`t know if Russ Titelman is still around,he produced Journeyman and from the cradle.Clapton desperately needs a strong producer.A producer in music is basically like a director in movies.Gotta get over is good and still got the blues,and I think some of the reggae might be livened up in concert,when he tours.But overall it doen`t flow,and the mix is too glossy fake sounding.Which kills me cause anyone whose seen clapton live knows he`s the real deal.Clapton still has tremendous skill as a guitar player.It stinks when your music hero keeps underachieving.Pilgrim,Reptile,Back home,Old sock are at best inconsistent mediocre albums (back home is unlistenable).Clapton and The road to escondido are ok,really liked the marsalis project,love his live shows he`s been doing.But his old time fans need something better than this.I gave it three stars as opposed to two,out of respect,but it`s really a two.Mellow is fine,but he needs to take a page out of mark knoepflers book.
0385349947|5.0|I feel sad that so many people criticize Sheryl's book WITHOUT reading it. When I told my husband that I was reading \\"Lean In\\", he said, \\"Oh..., but people say it's for only rich elite women who can afford full time nannies.\\" That is a result of malicious rumors. You can actually see the examples on this page as one star reviews. They haven't even read the book!<br /><br />I'm not a businesswoman and my background is very different from Sheryl's, but I agree with almost everything she says in this book. I have struggled with the same things for the last 50 years. I'm not competitive and I never wanted to become a big shot. But, I wanted to work and if I do a good work, I wanted to be recognized. I wanted to continue working after I had a baby even though my husband made 10 times as much as me and financially didn't make sense to hire a nanny.  I thought I was selfish to feel that way. I became depressed for a long time. Now I have a great work (even though it doesn't pay well) because my husband understood my needs and started to support me full-heartedly.  Wouldn't that be better if it happens to every woman?<br /><br />I believe that's the reason Sheryl wrote the book. We have to help change the world so that our sisters and daughters don't need to go through the same thing. Men will also benefit from women who are happy because they can fulfill their desire to work and achieve.<br /><br />This book is a great conversation starter. You might want to read it with your partner, and talk about the issues you have always wanted to bring up and couldn't.
B007MCTTHY|4.0|Great puzzle game. There are very few games that don't want invasive permissions, so I'm thrilled to find a fun &amp; challeging brain teaser that doesn't read my Phone ID.<br /><br />I would like to see times and scores, as other reviewers have requested.<br /><br /> Puzzles start out very easy and get tough by the 4th book. The additional set of &quot;books&quot; is nice - lots of levels.<br /><br />This is a nice app for puzzle lovers.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|..... not sure why the &#34;smut&#34; had to be so detailed. The gist of the story was actually pretty good.
1592407889|5.0|I have always been a fan of Shirley MacLaine as an actress and curious about her daughter and husband in far-away Japan.  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the life of Ms. MacLaine.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|It was the coolest book I have read I love it!!!!!!......PS the part that said _ _ _ is that he ate the cheese and _ _ _ _ _ _is cheese!!!!:):)
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Enjoyed the series very much have ordered the next 3 & looking forward to getting lost in the silos again!
B007JMW46U|4.0|Everything you'd expect is in here. Actually I did have some problems with the illustrations, some are cropped wrong so parts of the illustrations is cut off, or at very slightly skewed angles, or with double prints. It might have just been that I had an old style Kindle that couldn't process them, but it was a bit disappointing.  The text and stories are formatted well. The only thing I'd want was some footnotes that explain some archaic terms that pop up on occasion that aren't really in the dictionary, luckily I have a footnoted print version.
B00112GVFO|5.0|It is a entertaining movie. I would recommend this movie to a friend. I would watch it again. Hope you enjoy it too.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Love the way the family stayed so close and they forbidden romance , nothing like a good cry to a make a great book
B00942X8PY|3.0|This is a good brain game, however the graphics are very simple.  It would also have been better with a bit more instructions and few hints.
B00BMCLCG6|4.0|I love reading people's reviews on here... this a band with an average age of 50 not 20. As you get older your music changes, the sound is still good, vocals are still on target and lyrics are still strong. Is this the sound of 20 years ago, no. but you can't pigeon hole a band becasue of the sound and nostalgia you associate with a half a dozen songs from 20 years ago that defined your youth. Pick any aging rock band: aerosmith, sound is still edgier, but vocal range is half of what it was. Either you adapt, or you stop making music. I appreciate that bon jovi has adapted.
B007MCTTHY|3.0|This game has very simple graphics. The opening rounds are easy, but they quickly get harder and no hints are available. Instructions are minimal as well. It's good as a free app but I wouldn't pay for it.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|My daughter LOVES this app.  She fixes all her patients and celebrates each time.  I can see though that this may be a bit repetitive for older kids, but it's perfect for my toddler.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is a great addictive game. The wide range of level difficulties makes it great for all ages. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it quickly drains my Kindle Fire battery.
B006LSZECO|4.0|When I first began this book I wasn't sure I was going to like it,but then things got interesting. A very good look into the mind of a sociopath. You just have to see how it ends
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a great game but even with the updates the repetitious gameplay of jumping and sliding gets boring. So even if it dies get to be the same thing it's a great game considering its free.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|You come across very few book that are hard to put down. This whole series is just that. It was very well written with in depth character and constantly changing plots. I found the read very entertaining and tantalizing. You are told a variety of stories from the perspective of many different characters. It is a very good read.
B001GA1RFA|2.0|I liked some of the characters a great deal.  Hough I found the footnotes or endnotes highly annoying on the Kindle. There were too many per chapter to recall what they might reference and way too much work to go back and forth. So appreciated the ones I recalled and felt oddly bereft for not processing the rest.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|Zero Dark Thirty is riveting.  It is moving.  It is thought provoking.  Jessica Chastain gives a great performance.  Can't wait to watch it again.
030758836X|3.0|I think Gillian Flynn is super-smart and talented, but this book was not my cup of tea.<br /><br />A few pluses: it's very well written, with a high level of complexity that I respect and admire, and the author has a dry, ironic sense of humor that comes through occasionally.<br /><br />The minuses reflect my personal preference. First, if I don't like the main characters, I don't enjoy the book -- and I did not like the main characters! I also don't like an unreliable narrator. It's a technique that grates on my nerves. And without using spoilers, I'll just say that the beginning of the book definitely uses that technique.<br /><br />Finally, I found the ending to be very frustrating. I forced myself to finish the book even though I wasn't enjoying it because several friends had recommended it and assured me that \\"it gets better.\\" After investing my time, I was hoping to get some satisfaction out of the final outcome, but I was disappointed.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Ruth Wilson nailed this role along with Toby Stephens.  They have chemistry and their relationship is very believable.  My favourite version of all the Jane Eyre's I've seen.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I finally decided to see what all the fuss is about and watched Season 1 & 2 on Amazon Prime. I was hooked after the first episode and Season 2 did not disappoint me, either. I can't wait to watch Season 3!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I have always trusted the games this company puts out I have bought many and haven't been disappointed yet!  This game was pretty addicting
B000BHN7D4|1.0|Look, there's a good reason why this singer hasn't been very successful in this country!  She tries to be \\"hard\\" and \\"non white\\", but her voice gives her away (she doesn't have a great voice, let's put it that way). And her use of little \\"sound tricks\\" and unique vocal effects (affects?) just doesn't work, either.<br /><br />This CD also tries to sell itself through the sexy cover picture of the artist, and that's to me a sleazy attempt to cover up the fact that she's basically not very talented...
B008JFUTT0|5.0|I was turned onto this by someone who did not tell me the surprise contained in it.  The music is amazing, well filmed.  Won the Oscar for best documentary this year!  I am now lending it to everyone I know.......
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Such a good book...just feel like it was somewhat fast-paced compared to the first two. However, I'm still left wanting more.
B00AB0AR2U|5.0|I enjoyed it as it followed the initial story line; as with all the rest, it was a great movie but definately for &#34;mature&#34; viewers!!
B000002LRX|5.0|Making the jump from \\"The Real Thing\\" to \\"Angel Dust,\\" Faith No More decided to leave behind their mainstream success and create a work of art.  This album has so many different musical styles that almost anyone can pick it up and like at least some portion of it.<br /><br />The album is artistic, edgy, and just plain \\"out there.\\"  If you are or consider yourself a true lover of music, you owe it to yourself to give this one a listen.  And keep listening...it will grow on you!
B0095P31L6|5.0|Maybe good for the older kids; little ones found this a little boring, and very quickly lost interest unfortunately, sorry.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|Good read... I like the plot line. The way it ended makes you want to read more. I think it's a good sequel to fifty shades of grey
B004LROUNG|5.0|This is one author I will always come back to for my reading pleasure. He knows law which makes it easy to read and believe. Then, he throws in real life problems and happiness that balances the storyline with never a hole in the plot. Enjoy!
B007R6X9IK|5.0|A haunting, dreamy, gospel album with Dave Gahan on vocals, this is better than anything Depeche Mode has produced in the past 20 years. Hopefully Gahan and Soulsavers will continue producing music together for a long time to come.

B003B0D2QU|1.0|My wife bought this book - not because she like Obama.  Rather, she wanted to know where his crazy ideas come from.  She read a chapter or two before her BS detector stopped her from reading any further.
B00ANGSSWS|5.0|So when my dad bought this, i thought it was going to be a bunch of gothy screamo people singing about how eternal darkness will engulf us all. i was wrong. this band is very talented, and is purposefully playing up the over-the-top hair metal style, with a lot of cool songs. and in case that hasn't won you over, theres an orchestra piece in the middle. yeah, a string section
0307455874|1.0|No better than the other one.  My wife bought this book - not because she likes Obama.  Rather, she wanted to know where his crazy ideas come from.  She read a chapter or two before her BS detector stopped her from reading any further. This books is so full of it (just like the author), there's no way you can believe any of it.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|A very rigid \\"white-knuckle\\" experience for me. I was terrified for them, that they might be caught. I enjoyed it thoroughly!
B00845PRDS|5.0|I loved this movie.  It was a great look into the &#34;off the record&#34; missions our special ops forces do.  The scene with the SOC-R boats providing covering fire with the GAU-17/A's was intense.  The decision to use real seals for actors might have made some of the acting in the out of combat scenes less realistic but the payoff was great in the combat scenes.  These guys clearly knew their craft and it was amazing to watch.  Well done.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Every time I watch this I have to laugh. Very well done and clever. The songs are catchy and funny. I was actually surprised by the singing abilities of those involved. A must see.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|I'm not sure why so many people have rated this so highly. Have these people not ever read any good Science Fiction in their lives? If this is their idea of 5-star, then they are very sadly missing out. Perhaps the internet has been their only source of material.<br /><br />This series is based on what obviously was a short story with a twist, probably published on some blog on the internet. That first story is passable, but the premise is laughable. It is a bit entertaining.<br /><br />So, people told the author how great it was. Of course, he had to add more to the world of Wool. And the more he added, the worse the writing got.<br /><br />This is the most labored, hoary writing that I've seen since...well...ever. I might be proud of a first-time, very young, writer who put this together.<br /><br />Also, other than some knowledge of the parts of a generator, the author seems to know nothing of science. Just one example: people living in an entirely closed air-tight world are using a giant internal combustion engine to power everything? Where are those gas fumes going, anyway?<br /><br />Addendum: OK, I'm bumping up my rating by a couple of stars because the story has at least been compelling enough to get past the worst of the writing. That would be part 2: The author would do us all a favor if he could strip out the purplest of prose from that section. The writing in later parts is not great, but at least it doesn't make we wince too much.

B00B23O96A|2.0|Clapton has had his moments in the spotlight; some deserved, many not so much! I have always felt that he was an overrated guitarist and that his voice was never suitable for his genre. The blues require a raw emotion and deep pain along with a good understanding and appreciation for its rich history. I hear more soul, attitude, and overall chops in players like Warren Haynes and Joe Bonamassa than I do when I listen to Eric Clapton. This record is dull and lacks fluidity and consistency. The worst part of it is probably the cover of \\"Still Got The Blues\\" by the late, great Gary Moore. Generally, when an artist covers a song, the goal should be to add to the song by adding a fresh take on it or perhaps a different arrangement or something that makes it different or better. Clapton took a very powerful and emotional song with one of the greatest solos and he made it a doozy! Why?<br />The man sounds, tired, uninspired, and spent!

B000FCKGPC|5.0|Love the characters  and the twisting, turning plot in A Feastvof Crows... . it couldn't get thicker... or can it?
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I will definitely be ordering more of this product in the future, its just an around great item.<br />Small fits in your bag, I love it.

B007KZY1YY|4.0|If you like romance, this book is full of it.  It's every womans dream and fantancy.  It's one way to get lost in it.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I got this app when it was free, thinking that I probably wouldn't use it.  I was wrong, I do use it, and I do think I am able to fall asleep a bit easier. There is a good selection of sounds but I have my favorites. I like the timer  feature, going to try the alarm function next.
1932100385|5.0|This is a must see book..<br />Dr C. Campbell has done over 30 year  research study on Diabetes, cancer, Heart disease and autoimmune diseases all relationing the diet and what diet we should be eating.  It open my eyes, I couldn't put the book down.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|I enjoyed this movie so much I immediately ordered the soundtrack on CD - from Amazon ofcourse.  When I initially read the movie reviews about this film, I just thought the movie critics were hailing another low budget Indie type of film, but no they were not, this movie was well written, well acted and the music fit the story and the characters.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I am new to the &#34;knife buying & using&#34; hobby.  I have to admit, I have recently been bitten by the &#34;prepping&#34; bug, and am justifying it buy doing a lot of camping and outdoors activities.  The payoff is that the camping, climbing, hiking and kayaking is GREAT!!  The downside is after MONTHS of research, I am still learning about the gear by trial, error, and recommendations (personal and online).  Lot's of purchasing, then throwing away and upgrading to what I REALLY needed.. but didn't know it!<br />  I have to, HANDS DOWN, say that the BK2 is, as of yet, the best purchase I have made.  This thing is a tank.  It has a heavy heft to it, which I love, and the handle is rather thick, another plus for me.  Many other knives, although no complaints with quality, seemed extremely light and didn't quite fit my hand.  I am not overly large, a 6'3 male, but most of my purchases felt like they were high quality kiddie gear.<br />  This is high quality, full tang, touch blade and piece all around.  The sheath is also nice.  It takes a lot of effort to get it out, which I like after reaching for knife and finding it's not there!  it has a dura-plastic locking socket that makes it IMPOSSIBLE to fall out.  As I mentioned earlier, I am a novice, but this is the best knife I have purchased... especially for the price (1/2 price on Amazon).  If you have any doubts, just get it.  It's not fancy, but it's sharp, high quality, and durable.  FULLY RECOMMENDED.
1616550414|5.0|After receiving my copy of the book on Monday and reading through the entire thing non-stop for 4 1/2 hours, I can safely say this book is one of the most satisfying reads I've had in years, and a definite need for anybody who is either getting introduced to video games, or a long-time gamer with many hours and adventures under their belt. Not only is much information given about the history of the series, but one of the most sought-after answers is finally revealed: \\"WHAT IS THE TIMELINE FOR THIS SERIES?\\". The in-depth history is AMAZING. The large collection of production artwork included is unparalleled, and there are art sections for each and every game in the series (save for the horrendous Philips CD-I games).<br /><br />The book itself is extremely high-quality. It is nice and weighty, with top-notch binding. The hardcover front of the book is beautifully detailed. The typeset inside is wonderful and one can tell that the translation from the original Japanese was done carefully (Dark Horse is known for being one of the best English translation companies in existence, I'm not surprised they got the rights to publish this from Nintendo).<br /><br />My expectations were definitely met and even exceeded due to the sheer volume of content that is delivered in this veritable encyclopedia of Zelda knowledge. The only criticism I can give about this wonderful tome is that there should have been a bit more introduction on more of the artists mentioned in the book, as well as other staff that worked on the earlier titles. There also isn't any information about how Capcom became involved to create the Oracles games, nor is there an actual bestiary of the various enemies throughout the series. That aside, any interested person reading this review while they consider if the book is worth the price or not should know it is worth EVERY penny.
0812550706|5.0|Read this book a while ago, didn't know there was a series to it. Reading part 2 now.<br /><br />Can't wait for the movie!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|All the stores around my area were sold out of this movie, so I rented it on here and watched the ending scene about 7 times. Then I went and bought the soundtrack:)
B009UX2YAC|2.0|Well I think that subway suffers(Rome) could do better than that because it looks like a piece of ratchet junk that was found in the side of the road by a dump truck factory .That is what I think and if you have a problem with it I will be happy to hear what u got to say cause ain't nobody got time for a ratchet game made out of the street YOU NEED TO DO A LOT BETTER THAN THAT sorry if I hurt your company but you said (give your opinion) so I did thank you good even'in
B00AREIAI8|2.0|Cons: tack and gear don't just take coins they also take gems. You have to pay for the gems. After the USA series your horse has no more competitions. Your energy counts for all your horses, but your happiness and health are individual. You don't see your horses in the paddock or stable. You only can clean one horse then wait so many minutes to clean another horse.  PROS: good graphics, kills time
B003O86FMW|4.0|Awesome. Very nice work. I really enjoyed it, now I can't wait to see the movie in November!! Now on to the third book.
B00AYATBP6|5.0|One of the best albums I've ever heard. Steven Wilson and everyone else who worked on this album is amazing! The title track is hauntingly beautiful and amazing. I've heard it so many times already and every time I get the same emotional response. You HAVE to listen to this stuff to know what I'm talking about. Words can't describe the awesomeness of this album. MUST BUY!
B005J0VPNC|5.0|love the new additions esp video support. very easy to use.<br /><br />needs more filters and effects.<br /><br />watch the permissions. do not add any more permission than needed please.<br /><br />BEST value of all my apps to date.
0307474259|5.0|The author does an excruciatingly thorough job siting research in substantiating his argument. I love this, appreciate it, and can't stand reading every word in the long winded, excellently researched, well written book. I'm was SO looking forward to the segment when we get beyond substantiating the base argument. Highly recommend, just skip ahead when you feel it appropriate. Totally opened my eyes to the standard American diet (or SAD) and how popular dieting techniques don't work.
B00BBI9WD6|4.0|This is book two in the Honor Harrington series.  It's a little more polished than the first and shows the first hints of the political intrigues which will dominate the later books in the series.  There are three distinct 'sides' in this story and the macho nations of each have a distinct impact on the other two.<br />The book details excellent combat; both interpersonal hand to hand and extended space battles which take place between opponents thousands of miles apart.  The reader is lifted to highs, only to be dashed down moments later.  An excellent read.
0765325950|5.0|The Last Battle was far more epic than I expected, and no Deus ex Machina intervenes to save the forces of Light from ultimate destruction.  They have to earn it, and you're brought along for every exchange and every tactic (which some people in the comments apparently didn't like).<br /><br />The story had many loose ends to tie up, and I feel it made a pretty little bow with them.  I was entertained throughout, feeling every loss and every victory as if it were my own, and I cannot envision a better ending to the series.<br /><br />My only gripe, and it is not a gripe worthy of lowering the value of the book, for the book itself is fantastic, is that it left SO MUCH OPEN.  This book left open the possibility of dozens more books (at least a few prequels covering the original War of Shadow, and any possible number of sequels exploring the aftermath of The Last Battle and the Fourth Age), and it is maddening that in all likelihood none of them will be made.  The Last Battle has been fought, and we will never see how the survivors live out the rest of their lives or see the magic of The Wheel of Time ever again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My grand daughter loves this game. It keeps her totally engrossed on the long ride to our home. She is seven. It also keeps my 22 and 26 year olds occupied as well.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I have a kindle fire and for those who don't know, it really doesn't show you when it's charging. No light or anything and I was really frustrated with that. This app helped me know that it is charging.
B008OOYALE|3.0|this game requires gold that you have to buy with actual money. and it is horribly expensive!! they just updated the game and made everything even more expensive. half of the optiontions and things you have to buy are with gold. it is a fun game over all, but I am thinking about deleting it as it is to expensive and I can not do hardly anything. and even if you try to be patient and wait to gather silver from your dragons, it takes days to do one thing. my best advice is to not even get the game. it will frustrate you more than anything. my advice to the creators, make it cheaper! !!!
B008XG1X18|1.0|IT TAKES FOR EVER TO LOAD, FORCE CLOSES MOST OF THE TIME. AND THE OTHER HALF IT JUST SEAMS THINK FOR A VERY LONG TIME
B005IQZB14|4.0|Cheryl´s journey in this book is immensely readable, mainly because it's a journey so many of us have been on, if not physically then emotionally. It reminds me of a modern day fairy tale where our heroine is sent on a seemingly impossible task and is helped by many along the way to emerge a little less broken and a lot wiser about herself and her place in the world.
B005HSL626|5.0|I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS APP. I CANT STOP PLAYING IT. I SAW IT ON THE A COMMERCIAL AND I JUST HAPPENED TO BE CURIOS AND CHECKED IT OUT. AND IT IS A GREAT APP
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book was very well written and surprises you with the outcome. It also had a nice Romance building while it builds to the surprise.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|NOT BAD AT ALL. I DID NOT GET NOTIFICATIONS OF MESSAGES.SO I HAD TO CONSTANTLY CHECK IN ON THE APP
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|good game, quickly adicting and over too soon. would definitely recommend for anyone that likes a good mystery game. thanks!!
B004DLPXAO|4.0|THIS APP ISNT TOO BAD. I CANT FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE THE VOICE TO TEXT. THAT WOULD REALLY BE GREAT
B008HK3XYK|4.0|The only thing that kept me from giving a 5 star is that when I got the product it was the wrong color than what I ordered. The actual box showed the right color (orange) but when I opened it was &#34;black&#34;.  I sent an email to Amazon support and they had a new one shipped within 24 hours.  I have no complaints about the service.  I would buy again.<br /><br />Carl
B004XVMCMQ|1.0|I would not have minded this film so much if it had not masqueraded as an adaptation of Jane Austen's \\"Mansfield Park.\\" Indeed, anyone who has actually read the novel will find this film unrecognizable. It was willful and maliciously deceptive marketing for the filmmakers to slap \\"Mansfield Park\\" on a movie that has nothing to do with the novel aside from the title and the names of the characters.<br /><br />One day we will get the great film version of \\"Mansfield Park\\" that Austen-lovers deserve. This is not that film.
B00A32CKKI|5.0|This movie was great.  It was very moving, and I am aware of the word &#34;okie's&#34;.. Highly recommend this movie for university students.
B00973DDN2|3.0|I'm a big fan of the Killers, I have all their albums, of which Sam's Town is my favorite. All of their previous albums I've really been sucked in to and listen to frequently. This one I start and then often lose interest after a few songs. It doesn't seem to have the same energy that the previous albums did. Runnaway and Miss Atomic Bomb stick in my head as good ones, but as I write this I have a hard time remembering the names of the others, even after two or three listens of the album.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|Ten years is a long wait and you really expect some magic.  This has all the magic you want, it rocks, it pops,<br />and it mellows all in a good way.  There may be couple of songs not perfect to my ears but these are songs<br />others are in love with so I say your right- those are also fantastic.  I loved the \\"Outside\\"  album. To me<br />this album is just as good, without all the narration involved.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|There are a number of songs on it that are very distinct; almost like they could have come from different bands, or at least different albums, however all the songs are very catchy and extremely easy to listen too. I'm a big fan of the Killers, and you can definately tell that these guys are influenced by them on some of their songs, but again, many of the others have a totally different sound.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Loved every minute of it....I'm all caught an and awaiting the next season.  Glad I could get the first and second season through Amazon
B005HSG3VK|5.0|Love the pink and it protects my kindle fire, love it! Keep up the good work & I'll be ordering here for everything now
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Love the story, it's romantic with an interesting twist, not like the movie which was pretty bad. It's different and fun.
B0015KGWZG|5.0|This book was a real life saver 20 years ago when I was just 17 years old, alone in a foreign country, running away from a life of abuse and asking myself again and again WHY IS THIS HAPPENING TO ME? It opened my eyes and showed me that I was making entirely the wrong question - what I should be asking is WHY AM I DOING THIS TO MYSELF?<br /><br />I learned a lot at the time but of course I didn't rid myself from every erroneous zone only the ones which I was ready to let go at the time and I went on to make many many mistakes along the way all of them necessary for me to become the person that I am today.<br /><br />I now enjoy opening this book and read a few pages whenever I need to remind myself of those truths which I already know but which I keep forgetting somehow. Reading this book didn't make me wealthy or successful but I can honestly say that I am a very happy person, growing and learning and making silly mistakes everyday. My life is overflowing with love and beauty, from my son's warm hugs to that amazingly beautiful leaf lying on the sidewalk covered with little dropplets of rain with its irredescent oranges and yellows reflecting the morning sun.<br /><br />Would I recommend this book? The answer is a resounding YES. I believe every person would benefit from ridding themselves from their erroneous zones. Changing the World is not impossible all it needs is for each of us to change the way we look at it by choosing to be happy.
0062014536|2.0|like many other reviewers I was left numb and frustrated with the ending, it isn't that I'm against an open ending but it didn't work here for me. Open endings  don't equal to unfinished stories or to being left with more questions than answers which is the case in Requiem.<br />In spite of the ending I would've been more generous with my rating if the rest of the book had been good but it was just boring.There's no plot, nothing really interesting happened, it's just a group of people going from one place to another in the Wilds, even Hana's story is more appealing (though not much) trying to discover who her future husband really is.<br />But not only the storyline fell short but also the characters fell flat too, Lena becomes self-centred and annoying and in my opinion very selfish and Alex and Julian are just...well there, present but nothing more. All the chemistry, the tension, the romance has disappeared in this book, there is not one memorable conversation between these characters, any depht to their interactions.<br />I loved Delirium and liked Pandemonium so I feel sad that this is the final book of what could've been a great trilogy but just wasn't.
B000W91RUG|5.0|Love the show. Ordered this for my daughter for her birthday. Have not given it to her yet, but came in plenty of time.  Good price and free shipping.

0316228532|4.0|The book everyone has been waiting for.....what comes after Harry Potter??    I have read several reviews from disappointed Harry Potter fans complaining that The Casual Vacancy was nothing like her beloved series. Well, no it's not. It's not supposed to be. It's an adult book marketed as an adult book. The premise: small town, open city council seat, politics, deceit, and GO! A city council member dies leaving the townspeople looking to fill the seat, which brings to light the cultural and economic gulf between the two sides of town. No wizards, no magic.    I enjoyed this book simply because none of the characters were very likable, yet they were relatable, making it almost uncomfortable to read at times. I realized it was because these characters' innermost thoughts and desires were often petty, yet undeniably human. It was an interesting read that commented on class and social issues, while developing a plethora of main characters. The novel had a clear message that was sometimes lost with the intermingling story lines, however an intriguing read nonetheless.    Try it out. It holds some worthwhile commentary on prejudice and economic inequality.    Just don't expect wizards.    Follow @ [...]
0425263908|5.0|I really ejoyed Bared to You. Was looking for a fix after reading fifty shades of grey and it cured it. The book was jammed pack with page turning excitement all the way throughout. Couldn't put it down. No Christian but Gideon will definately be in my dreams tonight.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|A free app that gets you with in app purchases.  My son was playing until I started receiving multiple order confirmations for in app purchases that he didn't even know he was buying.  DO NOT ADD THIS APP if you'll have your kids playing
B005S9EJ14|5.0|There are very few movies that I love so much that I've actually bought them.  There are so many movies lately such as this that are flying under the radar that are so much better than most of the mainstream movies.  This is one of them, The Quartet is another.

B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is the perfect way to kill some time... Fun game does not require money to play.  If you are patient and use the arena you can level up quickly and earn lots of gems quickly as well.  Fun game and best yet it is free!  Would be great for any age and is a fun little app.
B0091QS88K|1.0|This will not load. It keeps queuing over and over but wont load. Please fix this. Glad it was free.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Love this game it reminds me so much of the original mario brothers game.  Fun and you can go back and replay levels to gain lives.... This game is great and it is free.
B00B7IJBUY|1.0|It pains me to say this, but this new album is terrible. I get that your style has to change a little with each album, but to not even rock anymore, at all? That is a slap in the face to their fans. I thought The Circle was disappointing and their worst, but What About Now makes The Circle look good. I didn't like Lost Highway, but I get that it was a country album and that's not my thing, so I let it go and expected them to come back and rock again. They didn't. Their last good album was Have A Nice Day. Bounce had some fillers but still had 4 excellent songs, this album only has 1 decent one (Because We Can) that doesn't even compare to any good ones from their classic albums. I'm not even picky at all, but this is just lazy and wimpy \\"rock.\\" They have lost their passion to create new hard rock music, even Richie's newest solo album was harder than this. If this is the way it's going to be, just stop creating albums and stick to touring. I am seeing them in concert in two days and I expect it to great, but I have about given up on any more good Bon Jovi albums.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I can't believe this is a free app.  It is wonderful and helped clean the garbage files off my Kindle.
B00979CS50|4.0|I give it four stars, based on a comparison with many of Neil Young's other albums.<br />It is better than most, but not quite good enough to rate 5 stars..<br />&#34;Driftin' back&#34; is very good, so is &#34;She's always dancing&#34;<br />&#34;Ramada inn&#34; is long, with a lot of instrumental playing, but holds up to repeated listening.<br />&#34;Walk like a giant&#34; is also enjoyable, and again, a long song<br /><br />The CD comes with liner notes.  Why oh why did the type font have to be so small? You need a magnifier (or 20-15 vision) to read the lyrics; that's another reason I give it 4 stars.  Also, the CD and liner notes lack the playing times for every song, which seems like an obvious oversight by the producer.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is one I have watched from the first time it came out on A&E.  Got as a gift on VHS cassettes.  But was happy to get it in DVD.  I never get tired of Jane Austen, just wished she had written more novels.
B000TENK4K|3.0|I am not usually into this kind of music - but I like to keep my tastes eclectic.  I enjoy listening to a wide variety of music and having an unbiased opinion of all music genres.  I purchased this album off an Amazon recommendation for my tastes after previewing the tracks.  At first glance, I really enjoyed the hooks that I previewed, but after hearing the entire songs I realized I was not in as much love with the album as I had originally thought.  The track that put me over the edge for purchase was &#34;Robot Rock&#34; which I do still enjoy.  &#34;Technologic&#34; is pretty cool to listen to as well.<br /><br />It's a little too repetitive for me, repetitive for me, repetitive for me - the tracks lack substance and don't really go anywhere.  If you like that then you should be squared-away with this one.  I don't feel too bad as the album was only $5 - perspective, but I probably should have just bought 1 or 2 tracks.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Love it.  It is one of those series that I can watch over again and want more.  The story is just so good and wonder what will happen next.

1594202842|4.0|I started reading this book with an open mind, and found it to be very inspiring, helpful, interesting and, at times, downright, laugh-out loud funny. Despite my expectatations that Chua would be a condescending perfectionist (expectations that were fulfilled most of the time), there were times in which Chua was delightfully self-deprecating and hilarious. Her love for her daughters and her kind, compassionate dedication to her two dogs make Chua a lovable narrator. Early on in the book, she admits her unrealistic claims for her daughters: \\"By the time Sophia was three, she was reading Sartre, doing simple set theory and could write one hundred Chinese characters. (Jed's [her husband] translation: She recognized the word's \\"No Exit,\\" could draw two overlapping circles, and okay maybe on the Chinese characters)\\" (24). Chua recalls her first meeting with her daughter's elite classical music teacher, Mrs. Vamos, and wrote that Mrs. Vamos's familiarity with the obsessive, super-driven Asian mother might have made herself seem \\"unaesthetic\\" in comparison (as someone who has lived in Singapore, hub of the wealthy Asian woman, I know how important appearance is to the Chinese female). The ending of the book is delightfully honest and candid - her daughters, at the time she wrote the book, are still teenagers, and one of them is outwardly rebelling against the demanding violin practices she is subjected to. So, the author herself doesn't relentlessly preach the undeniable results of her own parenting practices or paint herself as the flawless Asian mother: she merely states that she firmly believes that the Chinese method is the best out there.<br /><br />I have wanted to read this book for a long time, mainly because I was eager to hear about Amy Chua's \\"tiger\\" parenting, and to learn tips about how to provide your children with the skills possible to be successful in life. However, I was a bit disappointed. While Chua does write about the importance of her daughter's academic and personal achievements, she goes into little detail about anything other than her daughter Sophia's piano-playing and her daughter Lulu's violin-playing. In fact, I would say that this book is centered solely upon her daughter's musical pursuits - or, to be more exact, her own strange infatuation with classical music.<br /><br />The infatuation appears so deep that it seems that Chua may have neglected other aspects in her daughter's upbringing, or at least in the narrative of the book. Chua claims that her daughters practiced their instruments around 5 hours a day, without any day off, yet goes into fairly little detail about how the other hours in her daughter's day were spent doing schoolwork or other enriching activities. It seems to me that Chua's single-minded obsession with piano and violin - placed, respectively, on the shoulders of her daughters Sophia and Lulu - omits some of the more important aspects of child-rearing in favor of an obsessive mode of control that Chua can constantly engage in.<br /><br />Consider this quote from the book:<br /><br />While sitting in on her daughter's piano lessons (something Chua always does, rarely allowing the pupil time alone with the teacher), she claims that \\"all I could think was, this man is a genius. I am a barbarian. Prokofiev [the composer whose music her daughter is learning] is a genius. I am a cretin. Wei-Yi [her daughter's elite teacher] and Prokofiev are great. I am a cannibal. Going to lessons with Wei-Yei became my favorite thing. I looked forward to it all week. At every lesson I would religiously take notes, scales falling from my eyes. \\" Her own daughter, Sophia, goes on to write in a school essay that after she performed the piece, \\"my mom was scribbling furiously in our piano notebook\\" (124).<br /><br /> Imagine if Chua was encouraging her daughter to become an actress or singer, rather than a musician. We would instantly accuse her of being a \\"stage mom,\\" intent on pushing her own failed dreams and ambitions on her easy-to-mold young daughter. There are plenty of other passages in the book that make it clear how keenly Amy Chua enjoys going to her daughter's music lessons, even going so far as to claim that it is her \\"favorite part of the week\\" (45). Chua herself admits that having her children play classical music was a way for \\"my children to achieve something I hadn't.\\" While Chua does directly address claims that she is living vicariously through her children, she also points out that in Chinese culture (according to her), the child is an extension of the self. Chua claims that her parenting was inspired by the parenting she herself received as a child.<br /><br />However, the author is not consistent in maintaining that she was the result of obsessive helicopter parenting, nor is she consistent in extolling its benefits. Chua herself admits that \\"thank goodness I'm a lucky person, because all my life I've made important decisions for the wrong reasons,\\" namely for her parent's satisfaction. \\"I started off as an applied mathematics major at Harvard because I thought it would please my parents,\\" she writes, \\"I dropped it after my father, watching me struggle with a problem set over the winter break, told me I was in over my head, saving me.\\" She \\"mechanically\\" switched to economics because it \\"sounded vaguely science-like,\\" doing work \\"so boring\\" that she cannot remember anything she learned. \\"I went to law school, mainly because I didn't want to go to medical school,\\" while \\"working psychotically hard\\" even though she \\"didn't care about the rights of criminals in the way others did.\\" She goes down the \\"path of least resistance,\\" taking a job at a Wall Street law firm even though she couldn't \\"get [herself] to care\\" about her own work (31). Yet she adamantly enforces Lulu's strict practice sessions even when screaming, fighting, blackmail, bribery and extortion it what it takes to force her daughter to comply. Did she forget her father's life-savingdecision to let her quit mathematics? It is not until the end of the book that we learn that Chua's successful father was himself NOT a happy product of the Tiger-Mother Chinese parenting: he resists his wealthy parent's demands and isolates himself from them to make his own life alone.<br /><br />Chua seems like she steps in to do work for her daughters to enable them more time for music practice, claiming that she hates school projects because they make \\"parents do all the work,\\" even mentioning having to hire an architect for one of her daughter's Medieval Fair projects (64). Isn't this plagiarism or academic dishonesty?<br /><br />Many of Chua's dreams for her daughter seem to be centered in her own desire to gain more social status. Her daughters are continually forced to perform for elite audiences that Amy Chua has garnered through her own outstanding credentials as former professor at both Duke and Yale, with Sophia's hard-earned Carnegie Hall debut accompanied by a huge, expensive and extravagant party that stretches the family budget (despite the author's avowed disgust for American \\"crass consumerism\\"). The upper-class privileges of Chua and her daughters may be irksome for some readers (the scene in which they are eating expensive caviar at an upscale Russian café is almost unreadable, until the reader's heart leaps with either joy or schadenfreude when Lulu decides to have a meltdown and smash a glass on the floor). When Lulu is forced to play the violin at her Bat Mitzvah despite her protestations (a celebration that supposedly marks the transformation of a child into an adult, capable of making her own decisions, it should be noted), Lulu is miserable but insists that her mother can \\"take the credit\\" (201). Amy Chua herself writes that she \\"rocks back and forth, humming robotically\\"  when her \\"daughters perform a difficult piece.\\" Is this almost unbalanced concentration on classical music coming from an honest desire to see her children happy and successful, or some manifestation of Amy Chua's mental illness or OCD-personality? Chua frequently takes the credit for the accomplishments of her children, the most obvious of which is her idea to write this book itself.<br /><br />The Bat Mitzvah event, somewhat appropriately, marks Lulu's determination to make her own life choices and leads to the eventual disavowal of the rigorous violin-playing routine Chua has inflicted upon her: not exactly the ending I expected to see to this novel.<br /><br />In this part of the book, Chua finally gives in to Lulu's tooth-and-nail fight against conformity (a fight which Lulu began as a baby) and allows her to make up her own schedule. In short, Lulu starts having other interests and excelling in them.<br /><br />It's strange that Chua chose to write this novel about Tiger-Mother parenting right at the crucial moment in which she was unsure of whether her methods had produced the expected results in her children. In this way, the ending of the book is open-ended: one could read it as an endorsement of tough-love parenting styles, or as a cautionary tale of a well-meaning mother gone out of control.<br /><br />This book is written predicated by the assumption that many who read it will disagree with Amy Chua's fierce method of parenting because of some sort of jealousy. \\"Even losers are special in their own special way,\\" Chua mocks the Western style of inclusion. I do believe this is the main source of many people's disapproval of her novel: they know they they haven't been as attentive towards their own children and feel guilty, or they are envious that they themselves weren't afforded the vast amount of opportunity Amy's daughters were. It's clear that Chua loves her daughters and goes through many painful, laborious actions in order to ensure their excellence. While the results of her hard work is undeniable - her daughters have an appreciation for hard work and a finely-honed set of skills in the arena of classical music -the reader often wonders at what expense to the development of creativity and personal self-discovery such strides were made. \\"My dogs can't do anything - and what a relief,\\" Chua writes, \\"I don't make any demands of them, and I don't try to shape them or their future ... What a great relationship.\\" (166) It seems that Chua should see that her harmonious relationship with her dogs may be indicative of something wanting in her mother-daughter relations.

B00AS1Q93S|5.0|All the 1 star reviews are from fans of the book stating Tom Cruise doesn't look how the book says he should, who cares. The movie should and can stand on its own as a great movie, with all the ingredients of a stellar action/suspense film. I'm looking forward to other installments, I will say this though the movie trailer made this movie out to be less then it is. I wish I was able to see this film in the theaters but the trailer through me off, GREAT MOVIE!

B007GE2H3G|5.0|this film, a combination of computer animation and live action creates a universe in postwar Europe that just sucks you in. although the reporter, tintin, looks to be about twelve years old, which takes getting used to. the humor is fabulous, the story is delicious,unbelievable and yet it compels you to believe it. those twin cops are obnoxious and unnecessary, though, and the idea that they'd travel the world in disgiuse to return a lost 3wallet is beyond the absurd. this is a great family film. by family film i dont just mean clean enough for family viewing, which it is...squeaky clean...but genuine fun for all ages.

0307740919|2.0|I really look forward to all of Morrison's new releases.  I am an avid fan and she is one of my favorite authors ever, with Paradise being one of my top three books of all time.  That being said I don't understand the hype behind Home and why so many glowing reviews.<br /><br />Home is well written, which I would have guessed without even reading it knowing Morrison.  My problem is that the story didn't seem to go anywhere or do anything.  I understand that it is a story of hope and survival, but the short handed way Morrison handled it was more like she was outlining a book to her publisher than an actual book. We see Frank travelling with a short background/history of him.  We see Ycidra as she grows up and moves to Atlanta.  That's pretty much it.  Two loosely connected stories brought together in the end, with Morrison trying to shock the reader into a jaw dropping moment.<br /><br />A huge fan of Morrison, not a fan of Home at all.  Well written, but the story is more of an idea of story rather than the fully fleshed out books and characters she has written in the past.  Home is still arguably better than a lot of other stuff out there, but compared to her own written work this one pales in comparison.<br /><br />2 stars.

B00985E3UG|5.0|Since the 1970's America has gone from being a fairly lean country to a fat one. We've been nagged left and right about what to change and sometimes the information is contradictory. This book gives a new angle on the changes that have happened in the past 40 years by sitting down with various industry insiders and telling their stories.<br /><br />The book collects these stories into distinct arguments. In the Sugar section, for example, he covers discovery of sugar as an ingredient that can inhibit bacteria growth and the subsequent explosion of it in processed foods -- so much so that a 1/2 cup serving of spaghetti sauce contains more sugar than two sandwich cookies. He then records the former Coca-cola executive observing the very strong correlation between sugar consumption and obesity. He is a journalist -- not drawing overt conclusions -- but he is definitely arguing a viewpoint.<br /><br />If you find Marion Nestle's talks interesting but her books dry; if you are fascinated by the systems Michael Pollan and Mark Kurlansky describe in their books; then I recommend reading this book.
B001IXXYBA|5.0|Whoopie Goldberg is also superb, but the entire cast provides a very entertaining ghost story. If you haven't seen it, please buy this one. I am trying to collect all of poor Patrick Swayze's movies made before his untimely death. He was great!
0765325950|3.0|909 Pages of continuous fighting in one great battle. That was what this book is. I suppose if you had read all the other books, and remembered them (a difficult proposition considered they span 20 years) some of what was happening, other than just fighting, might make sense. But, for me the continuous battle just got downright boring after a few hundred pages. There really was no other story line I could find.<br />I read some of the other reviews and am amazed at the recall of events that happened in books much earlier in the series written many years ago. I'm envious. With good Aes Sedai and bad Aes Sedai, good Asha'man and Bad Asha'man and names of both sometimes very similar, it's hard to keep the good guys separated from the bad guys. I made the mistake of reading the books as they were published.  The better way would be to read them one after another. Jordan had the habit of making each book just start right out where the other left off, with no reintroduction of the characters or some hint of where they fit into the story, something most authors do when writing a series of books. This would have been especially helpful considering that the books were years apart in publishing.<br />I'm afraid that I was not captured by the book.  There was too much that didn't really hold water, at least to me.  Let's start with the Trollocs. We have what is apparently an unending supply of the large, carnivorous creatures that appear on the battlefield. They had been grown and nurtured by the dark one's underlings over a period of years, just for this battle. Let's see, we have a huge number of meat eating beings that had to be fed enormous amounts of meat over the years in order to become so numerous. Where did the food for this army come from? That indicates that they would have resided in an area where the vegetation was lush and able to support huge numbers of meat producing animals for a long period of time. That would mean vast ranches of meat producing animals to feed this growing army.  There is no indication in any of the books, that I recall, that such an area existed outside of the main countries of Andor, Cairhien, Kandor and so forth. Like many SciFi writers, especially Fantasy writers, the author ignores the logistics aspects of their armies and just creates whole hordes out of cloth.<br />Like I mentioned in the title, if you love action, unending and pervasive, you'll love this book. After all, that's really all it is. If you like more in a book, you might not be so enthralled.

B00B2TTVNU|5.0|I\\"m not a classical music expert or reviewer, but these five pieces are etched into my memory from early childhood.  Until I received a recent recording by Hilary Hahn, which led me to YouTube and then to Valentina, I was completely unaware of her.  But yesterday I spent a few hours listening to her YouTube pieces, including the \\"solo\\" versions of what she has recorded here with the London Symphony.  It was an invaluable experience (and highly recommended for anyone who loves piano).  Today I received these CDs and have taken time to listen closely to the 2nd and 4th Concertos which I find completely \\"ear opening\\".  I thought I had experienced the emotional heft of both, but the nuances of her playing have opened a series of new doors that have me wanting to know more about the composer's philosophy on life and music, and what he was living through when each was composed.  The 4th in particular is the finest version I've ever heard.  Bravo, Bravo!!

B000H4QD1O|5.0|Firefly is unquestionably the best thing to air on television since Captain Kirk. It's a flawless blend of sci-fi, western, and drama. The acting is superb. I had a lot of difficultly disassociating Nathan Fillion from the role of Captain Malcolm Reynolds when I started watching Castle. Don't listen to the people who say this show could have been great if Fox had not canceled it. It is so good the way it is. Yes, I would have liked the first season to have been completed (there's no \\"omg what next??\\" that would seem to finalize the season). and perhaps another season or two, but the real magic is the depth of the character development, especially with Mal and Jayne. Oh, and don't bother watching the movie Serenity. It was awful.

B0068RHSCW|2.0|Did you ever see a movie that had an absolutely perfect cast and an intriguing idea, only to fall flat on its face?<br /><br />\\"Dream House\\" is one such movie. It has the brilliant trio of Daniel Craig, Rachel Weisz and Naomi Watts, and the core concept is a truly fascinating one... but it's also riddled with massive plot holes and contrivances, and capped off by an absurd climax. It feels like a movie that started off as a taut Hitchcockian thriller, but got malformed by studio interference.<br /><br />As the movie begins, Will Atenton (Craig) quits his high-powered New York job. He and his beloved wife Libby (Rachel Weisz) have just moved into a beautiful new house with their two daughters, and Will plans to write a novel. But weird things begin happening around the house. A strange man is watching the house. A potted plant is left by the door. Libby and the children discover things left by the previous family.<br /><br />When a bunch of teens break into the basement, Will learns that a man named Peter Ward murdered his wife and children there five years ago, but lack of evidence kept him from being jailed. Will believes that Peter Ward is stalking his family, and begins investigating the bizarre still-open murder case. But then he makes a shocking discovery about Peter Ward's true identity, which throws everything he knows and loves into doubt -- and forces him to seek out the true murderer.<br /><br />It's difficult to summarize \\"Dream House\\" without giving away the BIG MAJOR TWIST, especially since it takes place right in the movie's middle. However, it is a fascinating twist, and it transforms what seems to be a simple thriller into a tragic Hitchcockian psychodrama. The entire movie is bittersweet, since even if justice is served, there cannot be a true happy ending.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it also has more holes than a broken sieve. The entire plot revolves around the most pathetically inept hit-man in the history of film, who manages to kill just about every person EXCEPT his mark. And there are so many contrivances that parts of the movie will give you a headache. Why would the murderer wait five years to kill again? Why wasn't the house sold? Why does Will not have any family or friends in the area?<br /><br />Even Jim Sheridan's direction feels lazy. A quick example: one scene has Craig returning home after discovering that this life has become a nightmare and everything he loves is gone. He huddles on the floor, and starts to scream. It's a beautiful, powerful scene... which is ruined by the stationary camera set up ACROSS THE ROOM, aimed at the back of Craig's head. It's like they set up the camera, and the director said, \\"Okay, time for lunch. Uh, Daniel, just keep acting and stuff, okay? I'll piece it together when I get back.\\"<br /><br />It feels like a good movie was twisted out of shape after it had begun. Honestly, the movie makes a lot more sense if you simply interpret most of the narrative as being part of Atenton's novel, since the weirdness only starts once he begins writing. Frankly, it makes a little more sense.<br /><br />But the actors aren't responsible for any of the problems, because they're all really good. Craig gives a truly mesmerizing performance as a happy, contented man whose life spirals into a madness and self-doubt, and he has such magnificent chemistry with Weisz that it's easy to see why they married shortly after. Watts has a solid smaller role as a jittery neighbor, and even Marton Csokas does what he can with an otherwise flat character.<br /><br />\\"Dream House\\" has a brilliant concept and cast, but the plot is so riddled with holes that it collapses on itself like... well, like a condemned house.

B0087ZG7UW|5.0|\\"Psycho\\" is one of those rare movies that needs no introduction, by a director who also needs no introduction.<br /><br />It's one of the greatest horror movies of all time, and it deserves to be. Alfred Hitchcock's magnum opus is a clean-cut, low-budget affair that lulls you with its slow, uneasy pace, only to shock you with bursts of bloody violence that practically make you jump out of your chair. It's the mother of all slasher movies, and the acting -- especially by Tony Perkins -- is absolutely brilliant.<br /><br />Secretary Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is entrusted with $40,000, which she's supposed to deposit in the bank for her employer. Instead, she steals the money for her impoverished boyfriend, Sam Loomis (John Gavin). She ends up staying overnight at a remote motel, where the only other people are the owner Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) and his crazy invalid mother.<br /><br />Then someone kills Marion in the shower. Believing his mother is responsible, a desperate Norman cleans up the crime scene and hides the body.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Marion's sister Lila (Vera Miles) is doing her best to find both her sister and the $40,000, even hiring a private eye and trying to figure out where Marion went before her disappearance. Then the private eye vanishes as well. Teaming up with Sam Loomis, she begins seeking out whoever saw her sister last -- but neither of them are prepared for the true horror of Bates Motel.<br /><br />The biggest problem with \\"Psycho\\" is probably that, like most legendary movies with a twist, the brilliant twist ending is so well known that its impact is lessened. Pretty much everybody knows what's going to happen and what is going on, so it isn't as shocking as it probably was back in 1960. It's sort of like \\"I am your father\\" or \\"You blew it up!\\" -- everybody knows the twist.<br /><br />But that doesn't mean that \\"Psycho\\" isn't still freakishly scary and beautifully-made. Hitchcock's direction is clean, smooth and elegant, painting the screen with light and shadow like a master painter. He fills every scene with a slow-building sense of unease, even if nothing bad is actually happening at the moment. It's quiet, restrained... until suddenly a shadowy figure lunges out and starts stabbing somebody, while the screeching violins stab right along. The violence isn't very graphic, but it's incredibly shocking.<br /><br />As Norman Bates, Tony Perkins gave one of the greatest performances you'll ever see in a film -- he comes across as shy, stammering and boyish, with an ineffable charm. He comes across as a harmless momma's boy who's probably never even talked to a girl before. But even from the start, there are hints that he can abruptly transform into something dark and twisted, and there's a subtle flash of madness behind his eyes.<br /><br />In fact, his is probably the only performance you'll truly remember from the movie. Not that the other actors aren't good, of course. Miles and Leigh give brilliant low-key performances as a pair of desperate young women, and smaller roles -- the car salesman, the traffic cop, Arbogast the genial private eye -- are all played with careful, elaborate care. But Perkins is just SO perfect and chilling that you can't get over him.<br /><br />\\"Psycho\\" doesn't need a recommendation from anyone at this point -- it's one of those brilliant movies that has achieved a mythic status.

B00BSJ8TX2|5.0|First and foremost I must confess that I adore James Purefoy. It has been ages since I've seen him on the small screen and I'm thrilled that others are able to discover what a brilliant actor he is. That being said, this is one of those shows that require patience and a good amount of devotion. This show isn't for the faint of heart. It is about a group of serial killers, not bunnies and children frolicking in the meadow! Simply put, it is violent, and contains disturbing and macabre scenes. Without the violence it would be another crime drama like 24 and Hawaii 50. If you continue to watch the episodes you will realize that the characters are developed gradually throughout the course of the series. Obviously the writers won't explain every single character's frame of reference/biography in a few episodes. It is set up like \\"Lost\\" in which every single episode reveals something else and you learn about the background of another character. Some may not appreciate that fact but I do. Everything is not explained and spelled out in one episode. The bad guys have more wins than the good guys. This may make it more difficult for a viewer that's used to happy endings but once you've become invested in the characters it ensures that the wins are far more thrilling, emotional, and meaningful. The rest of the cast is decent. Normally, I'm not an avid fan of Kevin Bacon, but he is excellent as a tortured former federal agent. The cat and mouse games between the two leads are thrilling, and clever. Does this show have flaws? Of course! Some of the actions on the part of the police and FBI are questionable and frankly stupid. However, I for one don't care. I don't watch this show for realism, I watch it for entertainment, and in that sense it succeeds. In short, this is definitely worth watching.
B00B47NO2O|1.0|I had been watching this show until last evening, in the hope that it would soon show some of the originality of [[ASIN:B0060MYKYY Breaking Bad]] or [[ASIN:B004X1VUNI The Killing]] - which it seemed, in any case, to be trying to mimic.  I now feel perfectly comfortable in saying that this show lacks any creativity or originality.  Realizing that their story line is just stupid, its producers are stooping to being increasingly vulgar.<br /><br />I wish that it were possible to give this less than a one star rating.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This is a fantastic informative read.<br /><br />The research proved extensive. Writing stye and examples made the reading a pleasure.<br /><br />I was a teacher and highly recommend this book for teachers and for parents in understanding yourself and your children.
B007HACDLK|3.0|Overall one of Flynn's slower-paced novels. I also thought the premise of a man having himself beaten that severely not very creditable.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|We had a lot of the movies on VHS. When the movie started coming out on dvd  someone in the family bought it for me for Christmas. WOW ALL 8 movies. Hey everyone bring the popcorn and jellybeans .It's party time. John Fields
B002KSPKRS|3.0|Good wireless headphones that work for both game audio and voice chat for those times you can't crank up the surround sound.<br /><br />Sound quality is solid, but has a tendency to pop and crackle due to it competing for bandwidth vs things like your router.  The poping and crackling can be enraging.  I'd rather step over a wire instead of having to change the bands that every other wireless electronic device in my home uses.  Also, any electrical device near the transmitter can affect the quality, so try to set it up in a place away from things like your TV, Xbox, computer, lamps, etc.  I was eventually able to set up everything in my house to play nice with my headphones and they worked great!  The problem is every time a new laptop, router, baby monitor or anything else with a wireless footprint enters the home I have to trouble shoot the connection again.<br /><br />The popping/crackling problem was more than 5 times a minute before tweaking everything else in the house and maybe once an hour afterwards.<br /><br />This only works with 2xAAA batteries.  Each charge will last about 8 hours.  Buy rechargeable batteries and you'll be all set.<br /><br />Built strong and sturdy, but should be handled properly.  Feels good for long periods of time due to breathable cloth ear pads and a loose fitting band that only clamps lightly.  Mic boom is a little short for my liking, but it works.<br /><br />If I could judge it on sound quality and comfort alone it'd get more stars.  I just can't believe how annoying the wireless is for this device.  The way the Turtle Beach people explained it to me was that the sound I was hearing was the headset being pushed off of one wireless lane into another one by another device in the house (or apartment complex).  Their solution was to turn off/change the band of anything that uses a wireless signal.  It works, but it's still annoying.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Its more fun o  devices like a tablet or ipad..because its a bigger surface to draw on rather than small phone or ipod touch..other than that there wasn't any problems with it to me ..it never froze up or ..force quited and its an awesome social game! So i recommend and/or suggest dowloading this game :)
B0019NB9A2|2.0|Throughout the entire movie there were times when you could barely hear dialogue or other sound (music etc) and then at times a certain portion of sound would overwhelm the room.  Very disappointing.
B0041T52S6|5.0|Although I do not think Michael Cera was the right choice for the role of Scott Pilgrim, I still love this movie. Edgar Wright is a fantastic director.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great item! Recommend for other people to buy. works perfectly with my kindle on my ipad and i love it
B000FP2OPY|5.0|The season that started it all. It is very naive and sweet compared to the other seasons. A great buy.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|for those of you who say you can't install, try getting in the best wi fi range you can get click the download button wait a couple seconds then go off the screen to home screen and you shouldn't have any problems,,,,,,,  alright :)
B002JVWRAO|5.0|My favorite Supernatural season. Thought the angel aspect really livened up the show and Cas (Misha Collins) is a welcome new character I soon fell in love with.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I liked this book a lot although it is sad.  As a person who works in healthcare, it provides some insight into what knowing you are going to die might be like.  Best wishes to hazel and Augustus, even though they aren't real - someone with a similar fate, is.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|I tried to update my game and then I lost everything I had earned including characters, boards, and boosts!Unfortunately I had earned everything for New York and Rio.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|So fun to play. Great graphics my child loves to play it when ever we are in the car or at the store. It keeps her busy
B00992CF6W|5.0|we bought this app for our son for his kindle and he just absolutely loves it!!!!! best app for him
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Excellent movie - really like the first season looking forward to the 3rd season. I would recommend this to everyone who like old movies.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My daughter and I both love to play this game. I have horses and used to show. The creators have done a pretty good job coming up with many realistic tasks that go along with horse care. I could be nitpicky and say that the saddle sits too far back on the horse and the horse is too tense in the trot. We have it on both a kindle fire and an iPhone. I do find it to be glitchy sometimes on the iPhone. All in all, I definitely recommend it.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|A great, good guys win against all odds, movie with lots of action. I love that it is Family Friendly.
B000058983|5.0|I don't give a flying hoot what \\"Rolling Stone\\" or any of the other tired \\"rock\\" rags say.  Hands down, this is one of the top 10 most beautiful \\"rock\\" albums ever recorded.  Genius.  Pure genius. If you are older than 40 and younger than a Glen Miller lover, AND you never had a chance to hear this music, you were robbed.  Like living in North Korea all these years and being deprived of all basic decency.<br /><br />It may not get into your brain the first spin or two, but it will. And the Changes will stay with you. Forever. Beautiful and highly creative. Every bit as poignant as Pet Sounds.  Arthur Lee deserved a whole lot better recognition for this great work.
0385349947|1.0|I'll read this when it is 50 cents at Half Price.  I really don't think my life will be ruined by avoiding this tripe anymore than I'll be ruined by missing out on fifty shades of mauve.
B0002VL0KQ|3.0|I cannot stand this crap. I'm glad she had a miracle. I did not buy it for myself.  It was a gift for my wife.  I think she liked it, so I'm giving you her star review. As far as I know, she listened to it once and had no complaints.<br /><br />If I hear that damned Celene themed Titanic song one more time, I will want to kill myself.  I'm sure they will rehash it all again for Titanic II. \\"A voice touched by God\\"...you know the dance they will do.  And then, of course, when computer graphics are \\"surprisingly\\" even better in 2020, there will be a special remake of Titanic I, complete with remixed Celine theme song.  And disco will be back by then.  It will be magical.
B0052GACNM|5.0|love, love, love this CD!  I have the first one and just HAD to get the second one too!  Keep the CD's coming
B00785P2QC|4.0|Virtual City is a good game to earn points while you sleep. You come back every day and you have more money to upgrade what you have, so you can build your city bigger and bigger. If you don't have it downloaded, do it now.
B008NMT684|1.0|you should not get it because it is for baby. So do not bye the game. But you kids would like it but not you.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Vegas mode is great. love the cumulative scoring across sessions. windows solitaire doesn't even do that! highly highly recommend this app.
B00899F0G8|5.0|This show is addicting! Can't wait for each new episode! Very suspenseful and good acting by whole cast. Love it
B008MM9630|2.0|This is the best free farming game Ive found.  You can play entirely offline and can do all the quests without ever spending money.  The people complaining about \\"having\\" to buy crystals are impatient, you canget all the crystals you need from sharing the spells on facebook, ignore the people saying you \\"cant do anything\\" because its simply not true.  Farm games all take time to get the best stuff.<br /><br />And speaking  of taking time....  the 1.8.7 update was released WEEKS ago at the time of this writing and still is not available for the kindle. Even though the kindle uses android, and android was out ages ago, amazon still doesnt have it up.  Kindle users missed out on the last two contests because to enter you needed to do things using  the new content. This is not the developers fault, it is entirely amazons.  Play this wonderful game on your phone, laptop, iPad, or anywhere BUT your kindle...
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Started watching this show in its second season and am hooked! Fresh new spin on classic fairytale stories you grew up listening to
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Wouldn't want to give any secrets away, if you have not seen it yet.  All I can say it I love this series and this season left me speachless and would highly recommend it
B008B1VYP0|5.0|This cd is great! Music is smooth and you can really jam to it. Adam Levine's vocals are terrific too
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I started reading the Twilight series before it became popular, before any of the movies were made.  I love the story and am sorry to see the end.  The books are good reads, I enjoy Stephanie 's skill as a story teller.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This is a very funny movie that you will find yourself smiling while watching. Anna Kendrick has a really good voice.
B00BESM14U|5.0|Awesome movie. I love Ezra Miller in this movie.  Not you typical teen movie.  A must see movie for sure.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book is wonderfully written, and takes the reader on a beautiful journey. I can't decide whether I enjoyed going behind the scenes of the zoo or exploring the insights of a young man engulfed in three religions at once. The religious aspect of the novel surprised me, but in the end was an integral part of making this such a wonderful book to read.<br /><br />If you've seen the movie, I would still recommend the book. The movie is a beautiful movie, and the book is a beautiful book.
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|This has to be the worst book ever.... I ordered this on my Kindle, because I saw all the great reviews on it, & what a mistake & waste of money.<br /><br />The characters are just morons.....especially the two leads! The writing is bad & the story line is just plainly ridiculous!!<br /><br />I will not recommend this book to no one, absolutely no one.....Not even my worst enemy!!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I found this to be a delightful, playful and creative take on the world of magic. Rothfuss is a fun storyteller, and the level of detail that went into creating the histories and legends and songs make this series well worth reading.
B006LA6IW2|5.0|Great read of an American hero. Also reminder of the day to day trials faced by the heroes who serve in our military
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|This wasn't really what I expected- but I enjoyed it anyway. I love all the stars that are in it as well. I found it funny as well.
B00867GKIK|5.0|It's comedy, melancholy, romance, actions, friendship, adventures... all roll into one! Nice 3D to boot! Pixar at its best, no doubt!
B0053O89WY|5.0|I bought this for my husband at Christmas. He loves the comedy. I have watched a few episodes with him and have laughed too. But He's happy.
B00AEJM6H2|2.0|People who are rating this game 5 stars must have genius IQ's because I can't figure it out to save my life! It's obvious that the player matches  jewels, but what's the purpose? Things start happening on the game board with no rhyme or reason and not enough understanding to have a strategy in mind. Minimal instructions are obviously written with the aid of a computer translator and are poor at best. It's still in my carousel, but only because I'm too stubborn to stop trying just yet!! Thank goodness I didn't pay for it!
B002P5XXR0|5.0|While watching the movie I totally fell in love with the music. I have also put that on my MP3 player and listen to it when I go for walks or just want to listen to music.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I absolutely could not put this book down. It totally consumed me day and night. I felt that I was transported into their world. A must read!
B0042H9YMC|5.0|WOW. When it first came out I was not even interested in seeing it. Then it showed on TV a few times and I only caught bits and pieces of it. So I rented it and totally feel in love with it. I bought the DVD for the house and I bought it and downloaded it onto my Kindle Fire HD.
0393327655|5.0|I am no good at reviewing books, but this one has helped me to see things a bit more clearly. I was raised a Christian and even graduated from Seminary to become a minister. I declined to enter the field because I just did not have the conviction I saw in others. Thinking something was wrong with me I struggled for years coming to grips with wanting to have more of a personal faith, something just did not seem &#34;relevant&#34; in today’s religion. I needed to move on to a more open, modern and self-evident consensus of what I wanted in a belief structure. This book helped me in understanding the direction the world is heading and how negatively the religious doctrines of the world are holding us back and literally destroying what freedoms we have. It is very easy to follow and comprehend. I have since purchase other books by Sam Harris and a few other authors and have a much greater confidence in who I am and what direction I want to take my spirituality.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like it because you can pick up power ups and not by all of them. I also like the characters. I don't like the stiff movement of the game. You can't teeter your tablet back and forth like on temple run.
B0090P98Z4|3.0|I played this for about 5 months,  and I was level 58 the day before I wrote this review. The next day, the game just reset and went back to level one. I loved the graphics and gameplay, although sometimes it lags my KF and I have to force a shutdown. Sadly, I lost all my 200 or so (I think it was 209) Glu Credits and all my skills and upgrades that I did with coins. I also lost about 450,000 in game coins. Make sure this doesn't happen to you someday and make you feel like you wasted your time on here.
1616550414|5.0|I recommend for all, have a lot of explanations, images, histories, and a anime comic, that's great<br />It have a lot of information about the history and how it became a great game
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|stupid game with horrible controls i am still trying to figure out how collecting notes around town have anthing to do with a horror game but to each his own

B009O5CLZY|5.0|This game is awesome my brother and I love it. And he's 19!!!!! This game is fun because you ride a yettie and penguin and wolf and eagle
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Great book . Love all the Percy Jackson books. I hope everybody loves it . (You know what happens to show in Texas?It freaking melts.)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is the best game I love taking care of my horses  I have tons of  horse apps and this one is by far the best you can buy horses  but not with new money
0316069434|5.0|Can't put these books down, always something exciting happening, I especially like Connelly books that are about Detective Harry Bosch.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I rated the game \\"subway surfers\\" a four star game, I would've given It five stars but it can get freeze up sometimes. I like subway surfers because some people say it is like \\"Temple Run\\" it isn't, Subway surfers is a unique game I would recommend to kids who enjoy fun and difficult (in a good way) games.
0446580848|2.0|Haven't rec'd this book yet but when I do, I'm sure my rating will be 5 star. At recept, I'll be happy to give it my rating.
B0025UHKNS|4.0|The watch is wonderful! When it works it is exactly what I was looking for and has helped tremendously in my running.<br />It does however tend to be a little flaky. Sometimes seizing up and some times losing a charge suddenly. I have looked online and thought about sending it back but after doing some investigating online it seems these problems are pretty &#34;normal&#34; for this watch and some people have reported much worse problems than mine. I have decided I can live with flaky.<br />Reception on it is great and I have not had problems with losing a signal once even when running on trails or in the woods.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|I don't listen to much rap, preferring alternative & pop, though the occasional album such as [[ASIN:B0009WPKY0 Late Registration]] has made it onto my radar. Despite this fact, I *love* 'The Heist.'<br /><br />The Heist includes [[ASIN:B0093NRLXO Thrift Shop (feat. Wanz) [Explicit]]] the upbeat, bargain hunting hit that's playing non-stop on radio these days (March 2013). It holds up well to repeat plays, but I was also happy to find some depth on the album in terms of variety of sounds and arrangements. A lot of the songs are collaborations (featuring a bunch of artists I don't know), but this makes each of them distinct, which is a real plus. Too often I get an album for a single hit, and every other song sounds the same. Here there's something new to enjoy around every corner.<br /><br />A little bit of googling turned up two facts I found interesting. First, Macklemore is based in Seattle - cool, local music! Second, this was an indie release and is breaking a lot of sales records. To which I say, good for Macklemore & Ryan Lewis!<br /><br />I really like this album and play it a couple times a week. Other songs that stood out for me are [[ASIN:B009G78HAS Thin Line (feat. Buffalo Madonna) [Explicit]]], [[ASIN:B009G78HXA Same Love (feat. Mary Lambert)]], and [[ASIN:B009G78L9U White Walls (feat. ScHoolboy Q, Hollis) [Explicit]]]. Absolutely worth buying this album unless you hate rap. Even if you aren't a fan of the song 'Thrift Shop' there's enough different sounding songs to make this worth checking out. Try samples of the three I mention above, for example.<br /><br />I have to say one more thing, I absolutely loved Mary Lambert's ([[ASIN:B0096Y8KDU Letters Don't Talk [Explicit]]]) contribution to [[ASIN:B009G78HXA Same Love (feat. Mary Lambert)]], I'm looking forward to hearing more from her in the future!
B002RI9UBS|5.0|This book took a deep view of our spirit and what joins us in religion, and then challenges that faith in God by a very human tragedy, and a story of survival in the most trying of circumstances.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|I got this album after hearing 'Some Nights' and 'We are Young' on the radio. With two great songs, what was there to lose?<br /><br />For my tastes (alternative / pop), Some Nights and We Are Young are the two best tracks. The 'Some Nights (Intro)' opener is a close second place, evoking of all things Queen, circa [[ASIN:B004ZJFH5K A Night At The Opera (Deluxe Version)]].<br /><br />The lead singer Nate Ruess has a distinctive voice and great range. Don't let the mention of auto-tuning in other reviews turn you off. Though there are a couple examples mixed in for effect, his vocals are outstanding and in tune on their own, and make up the vast majority of the singing on the album.<br /><br />The rest of the album is a mix of good and very good songs. Carry On and One Foot both stand out. I've been listening to parts of the album a couple times a day, and probably the whole album every couple days for a few weeks now. I'm still nowhere near sick of it.<br /><br />Great music, and I'm looking forward to checking out their other albums. Five stars!
B0067TGSOK|5.0|This book should be mandatory in high school. Everyone should have their own businesses even if only part time so that you can have control of your life. If you have been contemplating starting a businesses this book will prove to you that you can start it quickly and easily. Most of the things you think or people are telling you are your roadblocks you will find are just excuses to not get started. READ THIS AND START TODAY!
B004SIMNF0|5.0|I had a Cotton Carrier belt / holster and struggled getting the camera in and out of the holster. It required turning the camera while placing it in the holster and the screw mount on the camera kept coming loose as a result of twisting it. It was horrible. It also required the use of a hand strap that got in the way of shooting and slowed me down. I tried using it for a few weddings then gave up since it was slowing me down so much. Another pro photographer recommended the Spider, so I got and love it! It works great and it's quick to mount and dismount your camera from the holster and no annoying hand strap required!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Laugh out loud funny mixed with great sensitivity. Great characters. Totally nails the &#34;all in&#34; football fanatic and does a pretty good job with bipolar disease as well
B000NTPDSW|5.0|This is the one you want if you want to see it like Coppola wanted it seen.  For the price this was a steal!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|My curiousity got the best of me. I had to find out what a Hunger game was and what the big deal over the movie was. I knew i needed to read the book series to probably grasp the movie, but really you dont! Im glad i did however! The first and second book i couldnt put down, the third drags in some places and i did not enjoy it as much as the other 2, but i'm still excited to see how the film makers depict the story on screen!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is the perfect book if you like drama, action, and suspense. It will keep you reading and will fascinate you. I highly recommend this book!
B006HL9G10|5.0|Love this app.  I have a number of timers, both on my phone, and as stand alone devices, but this is my favorite.  The sounds it generates make it so much more pleasant to conclude a meditation, or any other activity I may be timing.  And the multiple presets are very handy.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 2 is an epic and emotional conclusion to my favorite movie series. I love the contrast between the light hearted adventures of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone to the extreme emotional intensity of this movie. Each movie has gotten progressively darker and this was an emotional finale. Once we reach the part in Snape's memories where we see Lily telling Harry how loved he was and to \\"be safe,be strong.\\" just before her death,we have a whole series of scenes that touch the heart and soul with their sadness and/or poignantness : Dumbledore explaining how Harry must die. Lupin Talking about the son he'll never know,Lily saying they would \\"always\\" stay close to Harry,Harry sacrificing himself,and Neville's speech declaring loyalty to Harry even in his \\"death\\". I'm not very sensitive in general,but Harry Potter really brought some raw emotion out of me. I cried during most of those scenes listed above when I saw this movie for the 1st time and I can still have strong reactions to them. The greatest triumph of Harry Potter is how much the series is highly successful in making it's readers/viewers care about it's characters. Then there's Snape himself. The way Snape's memories were brought to life is awesome and fantastically well done. The acting,especially of Daniel,Alan,and Ralph is exceptional. One major change from the book is far better in the movie than in the book. That change involves the fate of the Elder Wand. In the book,Harry tells the portrait of Dumbledore that he will return the Elder Wand to Dumbledore's grave. Harry tells Dumbledore If I die a natural death like Ignotus, its power will be broken, won't it? The previous master will never have been defeated. That'll be the end of it.\\" However,because the Elder Wand was truly won by defeat,and not necessarily by murder,this was no guarnteee the Elder Wand would never be won from him. By destroying the Elder Wand,as Harry does in the movie he ENSURES it's power will be broken. The movie's way of handling that was far better than the book's.And i really enjoyed the epilogue. Seeing Harry see his son off to Hogwarts was heartwarming. And I LOVED how the classic music from the 1st 2 Harry potter movies as the Hogwarts Express pulls out. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was a richly rewarding conclusion to the Harry Potter series and is a lock for 5 stars. :)ill be broken.

B00634GHJA|5.0|Was a handy app when I first bought it, but it stopped working a few months back.  I can no longer either send or receive pics from my Razr Maxx.  And judging from forum discussions, I'm not alone in having this problem.  Unfortunately, tech assistance is non existant, so I cannot recommend this app.<br /><br />EDIT:  Since I wrote this review, the app has been radically redesigned, and it now works flawlessly.  The new design is VERY easy to use, and very reliable.  Accordingly, I'm now giving it five stars.
B002SAUCBC|5.0|I really liked the story and found that reading it only at lunch time was an issue because I didn't want to stop.  However, I was a little surprised at the way it ended.

B00AEJM6H2|3.0|Easy to install and play. Kids are able to enjoy as well. Nice to have apps that are free thanks
B00127RAJY|5.0|This was recommended by a friend so I decided to purchase. Much less expensive than any store carried and the DVD works great. Now just trying to get fit.
0205313426|5.0|GReat book, mine was pretty new and the book is extremely helpful. Anyone who writes, high school student, college student, etc needs this book!
B001O5LVPI|5.0|I'm slowly working on getting all of my old Disney movies on VHS and this was another great one to add to the collection.
B001PPLKI0|5.0|The price was very reasonable and was just exactly what my wife was looking for, having been an Elvis &#34;groupie&#34; all her life.  After several weeks of use, she is still very enthused as to the choice and quality of the songs they contain.

B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Though the action was tiresome, the villain was charming and double-faceted. He seemed to love and hate M, and was willing to kill her and himself together.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|This app is not the only one who steals the very basis of Temple Run. This app and all others like it are horrible. Go for the original. Go for Temple Run 1 and 2.

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|My daughter loves this game, it is a lot of fun to play. The only thing that I dislike is that your energy goes to nothing so quickly.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|It was a great book I loved it I think I would want to read the other books in the series
B003ESKXGG|5.0|I have just received the watch today and am impressed with the design out of the box.  For 170.00 this watch is more than what I expected it to be.  It cannot be compared with an automatic or other upscale watch.  The movement seems to be solid and dependable.  The case finish is well appointed and the style is unique.  I do not expect any problems with durability and I do not expect that the case finish will mark easily.  As with all other watches in this price category, the band is the first item to be replaced.  As is common, companies will put more money into the watch mechanism and case than in the band.  I was pleasantly surprised to see a gently domed crystal and face markings that are not printed but applied to the face of the watch.  This is a nice touch for this watch and I foresee myself enjoying it a lot.
B0049GYXDQ|4.0|I loved this movie, so much that I actually wanted to re-watch it the day after I saw it on NetFlix.  I am so glad Disney decided to use the classic animation for this film - it makes Tiana blend in with the other princesses, rather than stand out like a glaring CGI character.  I think that this film filled a gap in Disney's repertoire of animated classics.  Little girls watching Disney movies want to identify with the princess, after all, and until this film, there were no African-American heroines in Disney's lineup.  Sure, the film stereotypes both white and black people, but that's nothing new; every Disney movie exaggerates a stereotype...or three or four.  The ending was predictable, but isn't every Disney movie?  It's a children's film, after all.<br />However, I was a little put off by certain elements of the film.  First, this is a princess fairytale movie...set in 20th century U.S.  This seemed like an odd choice, because the U.S. has never participated in a royal system, and princess stories don't usually take place in the 1900s.  Second, I was perturbed by the excessive use of voodoo throughout the film.  As a Disney fanatic, I am well aware of the use of magic, spirits, etc. in every film.  However, unlike other films, voodoo wasn't an explanation for a magical carriage appearing out of nowhere, it was a central theme to the story.  The Shadow Man repeatedly cast spells, communicated with \\"the other side,\\" summoned evil spirits, and was finally dragged by said evil spirits to \\"the other side\\" after he failed to repay a debt.  There were musical numbers celebrating his love of the other side.  Even the version of a \\"fairy godmother\\" Disney bestowed upon Tiana was a voodoo woman.  As an adult, I was uncomfortable with the heavy-handed application of voodoo.  Unlike other forms of \\"magic\\" portrayed in Disney's films, voodoo is a real-life practice that many people still participate in, silly or pointless as it may seem.  I suppose Disney had to come up with some way to transform a New Orleans girl into a fairytale princess, and due to the lack of enchanted forests or special lamps, they grabbed voodoo for its link to New Orleans' history.  I took away one star for the creepy voodoo, but overall, this is a must-see film, and one of my new personal favorites.

B005ZMV2EQ|5.0|My children really love this movie. The quality is great. Worth the money. Disney movies rock. A must to download
B000002LMK|3.0|For Neil Young &#34;tragics&#34; only. The content really didn't excite me. Neil throws out a few challenges to die-hard fans at times. Maybe this is one of them.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|I really learned a lot from this movie and it has changed the way I eat.  It is a must see!
B007KDFWRG|3.0|Heard one of the tracks played on the radio and bought the CD on the strength of it's quality. Can't say I'm impressed with the rest of the content though.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Except for the Holy Bible this is one of the best non fiction books I have read.  It will surely be made into a movie.  That would be fantastic other than the license that Hollywood takes to usually downgrade the quality of the book as well as the story line.<br /><br />The book outlines an honor code that is seldom seen today.  It is only sad that the honor was on the part of our enemy.  It is good, however, that the Nazis would have executed the person displaying the honor.  That shows what was being dealt with in World War II.<br /><br />I have given copies of the book to several friends and recommended it to many others.  If you can finish this book with no tears you just do not understand what was going on!
B000002KDG|4.0|Not a bad CD. Neil is obviously experimenting with a bit of post-punk heavy guitar stuff. Won't collect dust at the bottom of the CD stack as I plan to re-visit it often
B001RTSPVY|5.0|Absolutely love the series, own all five seasons now after watching the first.  Highly recommended for action, interest, bizarre, scenario
B0074EIQUG|4.0|Dan Auerbach has had a massive influence on this CD. It was played in part and recommended by the presenter of &#34;The Inside Sleeve&#34; ABC Radio National in Australia as the best release of 2012, which is why I bought it. As a big Black Keys fan it did it for me.<br />Not being familiar with Dr John's music I can't say whether he has radically moved away from his usual sound with this CD. Good stuff!
B00425S1H8|5.0|First purchased cheap chinese clone off of Flea-Bay that didn't work.  Researched the drivers and discovered on the Prolific website that there are a lot of fraudlent clone adapaters out that don't work.  Returned that piece of crap as it never worked and purchased this one OEM Prolific adapter and boom all my problems solved.
B008UFUOH6|4.0|Always have been a fan of Tracey Thorn. She covers a lot of ground in this &#34;Christmas&#34; CD. If all that's around the next festive season is &#34;I'm Dreaming of a White Xmas&#34; as a mood setter and you want to play a contemporary collection of songs in alto - this is for you.
B007MCTTHY|5.0|This is a puzzle game. It starts easy and gets harder. You actually need to play enough to see the harder levels and larger puzzles. If you have a weak attention span or get bored if you can't shoot something, then don't bother. This is a thinking game.<br /><br />The graphics are simple (if not overly) but fine and clear, including on Kindle Fire. The menus don't help you find where you left off. Once you focus on the content, none of the nits apply. (Again, you have to be able to focus and not be distracted by shiny objects in the room.)<br /><br />As a version 1 product, this is quite stable and solid. I would not go less than four stars at all. But because of the solid programming, the permissions (device friendly) and to offset the poor reviews that are irrelevant, this gets a six.
B001AP11L6|3.0|&#34;7 Nation Army&#34; and &#34;The Cold Cold Night&#34; are excellent tracks, the rest fades in comparison whilst retaining the loud factor.<br />If you are a big Jack White fan - go for it!
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|This was a funny, in-depth book. I loved it. Sometimes, the words were quite fanciful. But as long as you have a dictionary, you'll be fine. Please read this book! It is excellent.
B008HFWF3U|5.0|The CDs arrived yesterday, in mint condition.  Pat Metheny has, for nearly 34 years,  been one of my most favorite guitarists because he has never been afraid to experiment with his owns songs and those other artists who are fortunate enough to have some of their music placed into the hands of this truly phenomal musician.  The CDs arrived after having been on order for a only a few days,  which I very much appreciated from Amazon.

B008XBCJ34|4.0|I'm not so much a huge fan of the movie itself, but the 3D version is pretty amazing to watch. This title is a good one, even if you're not much into fantasy type flicks.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|Game worked great on my kindle for a month, then the game updated and it closes itself upon opening. Haven't been able to play for over 6 weeks and have reported the glitch at least 10 times. Apparently they have no interest in fixing the game for kindle players.
B002BWP4A6|2.0|When David Lynch made Twin Peaks, a series about unexplained events and deaths in a small remote town, he had the sense to make it interesting and introduce us to interesting characters. White Ribbon fails on both accounts and as a result is excrutiating to sit through. The White Ribbon is a pretentious effort to show us that Nazism had its roots in the everyday repression suffered by ordinary people in pre-World War One Germany. In this film, a small town is ruled rather brutally by a handful of men: the pastor, the doctor and the landowner, each with their own character perversions and dark habits. Bad things begin to happen: the doctor's horse is brought down by a wire tied between two trees. A peasant's wife falls to her death in the sawmill, the same place where the landowner's young son is later found gagged and beaten. And on and on it goes, with increasing public suspicion and hysteria greeting each odd event. In the right hands this could be effective but the problem is that we don't care a fig for any of the main characters, who are unattractive and speak in stilted sentences interspersed with a lot of silences. The narrator is a bore. The film draaaaaaaaaaags on and does a very bad job of explaining how the Germans' supposed love of order and their unwillingness to speak out against what is wrong is a direct cause of the Holocaust. A much better explanation might be the huge psychological damage wrought by World War One, which introduced the concept of mass death. This was a big missed opportunity.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Was a gift for my son, was pleased at how fast it got to us. Might not be a movie I would pick, but he likes it.

B009NCM248|4.0|If you dig these guys like I do then download it. No need to listen to the whole CD. If you have enjoyed the past onez...you will enjoy this one!  I don't give out 5 stars unless its something special.
1608955702|5.0|Neil is a true teacher. As with his previous books, he doesn't scare you off with overly technical jargon and shows you that it's not all about expensive equipment. You will understand the concepts and be able to manage almost any lighting situation by the end of the book. As photographers, we cringe at the thought of shooting in bright midday sun...others fear low light and Flash. He covers it all with excellent photographs, real-world tips and clear descriptions. Prior to diving into the book, it does help to have a general understanding of the basics: ISO/shutter speed/aperture/focal length. For the automatic mode shooters out there, this book will help ease you out of that safe zone and challenge you to really use the camera to work with your light. Neil is not one of those photographers who leaves you mystified and wondering, \\"How'd he get that shot?!\\". It's all spelled out with simple diagrams, pull-back shots (which I totally love!) and camera settings. You'll get a glimpse into how he sets up a shot. He walks you through the reasoning behind his selection of location, poses & positioning and settings - always keeping direction and quality of light in mind. I enjoyed reading his useful and creative alternatives to using direct on-camera flash, again with beautiful examples. So in my opinion, it's a must-have for any portrait photog's arsenal of reference materials. It's even a handy portable size that will fit into the laptop compartment on your camera bag.

B000N2HBSO|4.0|D.K. Goodwin has written a stellar book. Her research is indefatigable and her insights are those of a true political history buff. Mostly though it is an approachable read that endears one to America's greatest President. Oh, how I wish Mr. Obama could pull off the Herculean tasks that Mr. Lincoln did with generosity of spirit and yet, cunning political adeptness. Our entire political landscape today makes those Team of Rivals seem superlative or today's crop seem petty and small.<br />Jeff Tuttle, currently in Brisbane, Australia

0802798225|4.0|I liked this book. A lot. I wasn't really in love with the writing style the whole way through, per se, but the middle of this book completely sucked me in.<br /><br />Brittany is \\"Miss Perfect\\" and all the cliche's the most popular girl in high school needs. Have to say, I wasn't really a fan of her to start with. But I kept reading, and over time I liked her a lot more. So why did I keep reading? One word: Alex. Bad boy extraordinaire. He's in a Mexican gang and 100% bad ace (look, no cussing Amazon! ;) ). I wanted to read every juicy detail about him. Both from his perspective and Brit's. Because there's more to him than meets the eye.<br /><br />I loved their relationship! And hearing all about the gang life. And I feel like I learned some Spanish along the way. ;)<br /><br />I liked the author's ideas and the plot development. And I LOVED that around 80% in when she could have chosen some cheesy lifetime movie ending- she didn't. THANK YOU!<br /><br />My only thing is that the ending fell a little flat for me. I'm ALL about a fairy tale ending, but this one.... I don't know... I just needed more. More of what Alex was thinking. More story. More meat of some kind. It all felt so rushed and tied into a perfect bow in the last 3 to 4 chapters. Plus I have questions about what happened and how that geeky guy helped Alex. (Trying not to write specifics that give any spoilers)<br /><br />I would definitely recommend it! And I may read it again one day when I need some more intense bad boy. Alex was a tasty treat fo sho!

B008L1DNGI|2.0|I used to LOVE this game on the Sega dreamcast as a fun multi-player game. I bought the iPad version which has a multi-player feature. I bought this version for my wife's Kindle hoping we could play together. Sadly I discovered there is no multi-player on the android version. Very lame as the game is only barely ok as a single player experience...

B002OG5GT8|5.0|The first one of these I got was dead out of the box. The second one charged and has stayed working for a couple of years. It really does boost the sound and with some videos (especially those on You Tube that have poor sound quality), this can make a BIG difference.<br />I just clip it to to my computer at night and let it charge and its good to go when I want it.<br /><br />NOTE<br />Just make sure you turn it off when done using it. Nothing is worse than going to the computer and realizing you forgot to plug it in and forgot to turn it off.
0783240287|5.0|This is an odd musical but its really interesting. I liked it a lot and I enjoy owning it. The soundtrack is also very good. If you have not watched this, watch it and if you like it, buy it. I have found myself watching it several times. It is kind of a feel good movie and the scene with the Pharaoh is great. The guy who played the Pharaoh did a wonderful job (as did Donny Osmond)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I started watching this in the middle of season 3 during the most notable power outage in the history of sports (Jan 2013). Right then I knew I would want to watch the entire series and catch up. Got seasons 1, 2 and 3 and watched all of them in a matter of weeks. Now I can't wait for season 4.<br /><br />It is very engaging and revealing in its details about early 20th century domestic life in rural England.

B007REV4YI|1.0|I suppose they spent a lot of money on this turkey but it doesn't show. I saw it in Blu Ray in my home theater and I found the picture and sound to be very ho-hum. I won't even mention the embarrassing \\"acting.\\" The \\"plot\\" was positively insulting--and so boring I could easily have turned the damned thing off during The Big Shoot Out (stolen--everything was stolen--from \\"Straw Dogs\\") at the end. My favorite scene was the hilarious look on \\"Bond's\\" face when the Evil Villain blows up his Aston Martin (the Goldfinger car they lugged in to please their geriatric fan base and pad this mediocre insult to the comparatively brilliant era of Sean Connery). I can't believe I even rented this thing (action movies are definitely not for me) but I read some glowing review on a Blu Ray site--particularly effusive about picture and sound quality-- and thought what the hey, I'll give it a shot. Of course I knew this was going to be a James Bond movie (check your brain at the door) but this was just awful film making.<br /><br />This franchise has been worked completely to death...but then, looking at the one thousand four-to-five star reviews, maybe not. I'm reminded of a cartoon of two oldsters coming out of a movie theater, the marquee reads \\"Rocky XXII,\\" and the old man is saying \\"I still like Rocky I the best.\\"<br /><br />And a billion dollar box office and 92% positive reviews at Rotten Tomatoes? Good God.<br /><br />Personally I feel slightly tainted...like I've seen a snuff film. No more \\"blockbusters\\" for me.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abbey is so well done, it is hard find where to start.  It is very engaging, or maybe addicting.  It is such an insight into a different place, a different era and a different classe of people.  The characters are well developed, diverse and extremely well portrayed.  The twists and turns in the plot constantly play with your emotions.  A truly great show!  I would give it more than five stars if I could.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Love this!  I may not be an experienced gamer, but the 3D aspect of this game and the ability to rotate the cube in that space is fantastic.  Very relaxing and I feel like my brain is expanding when I play.
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|...drama, that is.  Downton Abbey just keeps piling it on; one scene of drama after another, on and on and on.  Could it, at some point, just finally reach that brink of too much...or enough already?  I wonder....<br /><br />That said, it kept me watching through the very last scene, and a dramatic one it was (though not surprising, given the foreshadowing).
B0089EHWQE|5.0|What a powerful, beautiful, poignant novel!  As a physical therapist and triathlete, I personally related to so many of the characters.  I am forever touched by this story.  It has ruined all the books that will follow....
B009GEPPYC|4.0|I notice this movie has garnered a broad variety of opinions and star ratings that run the gamut.<br /><br />But seriously people, let's not take this movie too seriously.  If the viewer is searching for an intellectual or spiritual experience, a movie that inspires instrospection, or a movie that will stand the test of time, Rock of Ages is probably not what you're looking for (unless you're a child of the 80s and are still quoting lines from Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Porky's).  However, it the viewer understands this movie doesn't offer elements of intellect, thereby having a more realistic expectation of the movie, then this is a downright fun flick to watch.  And if the viewer is a child of the 80s who grew up listening to the cassette tapes of some of the era's greatest Glam Rock Hair Bands, then this movie is nothing less than a grand trip down Memory Lane, singing along with great oldies (No Way!!  Oldies??  Say it isn't so!) from groups like Def Leppard, Journey, Foreigner, Joan Jett, Pat Benatar, REO Speedwagon, Guns 'N Roses, The Scorpions, and so much more.  And in addition to the music, the directors have mixed in some type of simple love story played out by characters with combined IQs of maybe a 100 - but that's okay, cuz this movie wasn't made for the story (or the intellectual viewer) - it's all about the MUSIC.<br /><br />So be realistic about this movie and simply enjoy it for what it is - a 2 hour retreat from the world to the nostalgia of a great music era gone by.  Do that and you just might find yourself being simply entertained as you sing along to some great tunes that helped define the era.  Expect more than that, and you'll probably be disappointed.<br /><br />P.S. Some of the lip syncing is pretty bad too, but just go with it!<br /><br />P.S.S. Having said all that, in the interest of fairness across the generations I am obligated to report that my teens say this music makes their ears bleed...but what would they know, they're just teens - though they do seem to have all the answers to life's mysterious questions, or so they tell me, their stupid old man.  But I'm grateful they allow me to soak up their wisdom...really.teens - though they do seem to have all the answers to life's mysterious questions, or so they tell me, their stupid old man.

B005LW5J9O|3.0|Don't let the title deceive you, the book is 95% the story of the finding and distribution of a single poem with some background for the history and very little anecdotal evidence for the past 400 years. The book is well written and the author clearly went through an immense amount of research in writing the book, however, I found myself disappointed and somewhat unconvinced by the author's premise when finished reading. All in all a decent read with interesting facts interspersed, but inappropriately titled.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|It's a classic for a reason. Very well written. My 12 year old son and I are reading together. Love the whole perseverence theme and how Buck adapts and becomes more than what he was in the beginning. And how changes and challenges in life can make you stronger and make you realize parts of yourself you did not realize existed.
1439152802|5.0|The story revolves around a young Jewish girl living in Paris during WWII.  My book club chose it for one of our monthly reads, and I found the book both very sad and also inspiring.  I would recommend it for the mystery and some history.
081297381X|1.0|The author really has little to say. The book is repetitive, to say the least, reiterating the same concept endlessly, until even he runs out of new ways to say it, so just repeats himself. Whatever good ideas are there are obscured by the pomposity of the presentation.<br /><br />And he seems to confuse his opinion with fact. For example where decides to let us know, even though it's irrelevant, \\"The Apple technology is vastly better (than Micosoft's) yet the inferior software won the day. How? Luck.\\" Whatever you think about Apple and Microsoft, this pronouncement is an example of his arrogance. There are many reasons to chose MS software, and it's their Office that is found on a great many Macs. He also seems to confuse \\"technology\\" with \\"software\\". Ignorance and arrogance is a combination that devalues whatever else you may have to say. The book is riddled with this kind of egomania.<br /><br />His previous book was pretty good, but whatever value may be in this one is way too hard to extract.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I don't usually go with the crowd when it comes to bestsellers, and I'd put off reading the 'Hunger Games' for that very reason. But without a doubt, I give it five stars, and I'm glad I didn't listen to all the haters.<br /><br />It's a young-adult, so if you read, you should expect that the characters won't be adults. It surprises me when I see reviewers attack the personality of the characters, when they are acting exactly as they should based on their age. I'm honestly not sure what I liked so much about the 'Hunger Games', especially since the first chapter took a lot to get through, but once I did, I was addicted. I read it and listened to it on Audible simultaneously. Normally, I'd swap off so I have more reading time, but I didn't want to miss anything, so essentially, I read this book twice in one week.<br /><br />Katniss does frustrate me a tad, but again, she's sixteen, so she should be confused. Not only is she a teenager, she's a teenager with the weight of her family and now others' lives hanging over her head, so yeah, she's a little troubled to say the least.<br /><br />I also did not see any deep political rhetoric, as implied by reviewers. What I saw was a downgrade of society that would \\"allow\\" this to happen.<br /><br />Overall, the story was imaginative, filled with action, a touch of romance, and well-written. Those factors, in my book, deserve five stars.<br /><br />Carmen DeSousa, bestselling author of [[ASIN:B006PS21NU She Belongs To Me]]
B0091REZMW|5.0|for anyone who likes a search and find type of game this one is a very fun one to try!
0451169514|5.0|I didn't think that I would like this book since it had 1,000+ pages.But once you start you will read half the book and not even know it.This book is my all time favorite stephen king book.I didn't really like his novels but once I read IT I was hooked.this book is a must read for every horror fan out there this book will not disappoint.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Love this show.  ITs classic good vs. evil.  They have great writers.  My only criticism is that the episodes don't come quick enough.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|One of the best books I have read in quite a while. I really want to see the movie now!!
B000FC0ZAI|1.0|I bought this book hoping that it would be good, but my vocabulary was not as good as i thought. The author uses so many words that i dont know the meanings to, that i have to look up the defintion of each word to understand what each sentence means. I haven't gotten far enough because I loose my focus after looking up what each word means.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The Humger Games books are good reads and hard to put down.  A little creepy though because in the back of my mind I kept thinking that something like this could actually happen in the future. Scarey !
B00AJLHTT0|5.0|This is beyond great.  Hurt your ears with volume and disturb your neighbors.  Nick Cave is an acquired taste, but well worth the effort.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|This book has change my life in so many ways, i have recommend it to my dearest friends and family members. Thank you.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Great graphics, items are very well hidden, better than most hidden picture games I have played. You will like this one
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This was the best game  I have ever bought best first person shooter grate graphics<br />Good guns and it was worth the 6$
B007IV1E2W|5.0|I was introduced to the show almost 2 years ago and can't stop coming back for the Doctor's whit and brooding attitude.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love this game with all the sound effects.  Very entertaining!  It has become one of my favorites I hats to put it down.
B00BKTWBMA|4.0|Not Clapton's best effort. Lots of reggae and country influence. I love Clapton. This is just another album from him.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|would recommend to all my friends and family. Well written, cliff hangers at the end of each episode make you have to pause in the middle of an episode when you want to stop watching.
B00122BEPA|5.0|This is the definitive Van Halen collection. I never get tired of these songs. I can't settle the David Lee vs Sammy debate. I love both of them for different reasons. The band is like two different, but excellent entities with them.
B000SGRONM|2.0|The first story where he's an elf at Macy's is uproariously funny, the rest no. I am not even going to finish the book after some of his more disturbing ones further in the book.
B005BUZJ6O|5.0|I love the covers of songs I never liked much from the original artists. The original S&H songs are beautiful, haunting. This is one of my favorite albums in my collection!
B00BHU9DUK|2.0|the film was very disjointed and hard to follow.  My daughter was ready to turn it off multiple times during the movie but I was sure that it would get better.  Costumes were lovely.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|The main character is an unusual combination of traits. The back story is: as a young man was self absorbed, exceedingly wealthy, charismatic and pleasantly frittering away his life and talents while waiting to inherit his fathers immoral financial empire (read Wall Street financial industry).<br /><br />After being unexpectedly marooned on a very dangerous isolated island, the prodigal son returns home a transformed man.His new life's mission and single focus is to right the many wrongs of his fathers dishonest business dealings and his former associates.<br /><br />Our protagonist is now an altruistically driven young man whose newly acquired special ops combat skills (from years of surviving on the island) sets the scene for &#34;Arrow:. Interestingly, our guy avoids killing his quarry when possible. His preferred modus operandi is to creatively set up his prey so that law enforcement can do their job.<br /><br />The characters are complex and  multidimensional and the story line has many unexpected twists and turns.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|This movie was full of action and the story line was interesting.  It would appeal to both men and women.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun game for when you have some extra time to kill. It doesn't take too long to play so I play it five minutes at a time throughout the day
B000V5Y1SQ|5.0|I enjoy the diversity of the characters. The plots are interesting and timely. I always enjoy reviewing them. I plan to watch the whole series.
B005LAIIFS|5.0|i enjoyed the movie as much as i enjoyed the hopping eggs. its a great way to teach valuable lessons to children about hopes and dreams (as well as bullying).
B00A0HQ7H8|4.0|I bought this album because her first album was phenomenal. Her voice ranges from sultry jazz singer to child-like voice hip-hop (if that's even a term?). The songs in this album are interesting nonetheless but I didn't like it as much as her first album. Her rendition of blue velvet was interesting but I think I prefer the original version better. If you're a Lana Del Rey fan, then definitely buy...maybe you'll like it more than I did.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|I can't believe how much lies are there in this movie but I still loved it<br />It's more si-fi than action
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great show, filled with drama and subtle sarcasm. I love the way the show ties in the upstairs upper class with the downstairs lower class. Five stars!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This was a great book written by a modern hero. He lived a great life and contributed much to the US of A. I recommend reading this book and learning about the sacrifices our men and women make for this country
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|An overall brilliant production that leaves the viewer longing for more at the end of each episode - can't wait for next season!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Good book. I definitely recommend this to anyone that wants to know what Seals sacrifice. I enjoyed this book. I couldn't put it down.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The video quality of the last episode was faulty.  The picture would freeze while the sound continued and then the sound stopped while the picture caught up.  Several hours later the first half hour or so did the same, stopped playing the video for about 10 minutes and when resumed it was fine.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I recommend that people should read this book. It tells the story of how a team of Seals gave their lives for their country and the amazing obstacles that Marcus had to get through so he could come home and tell the story of how those hero's died. I have a lot of respect for Seals and what they do.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Fun story with some amazing 80s references. Can't wait to see how my son and daughters like it without having lived through the Reagan administration. If you like geek culture mixed with pop culture you are in for a treat.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was a well written book that goes in depth what teenagers feel when going through depression. I enjoyed this book and recommend others to read it
B00BHMETKC|2.0|Are you serious? This beat out all the other movies this year?  I have not seen the other movies, but I venture they were better than this.
B000SEFNMS|4.0|This book was a recommended to me by a friend. Although I not th he most versatile camper or . Outdoorsman I do enjoy nature thoroughly and found this book extremely interesting. Chris willremain forever alluring to me and I love this adventurous book.
B00821OX98|5.0|love the series ready for it to come back on.like the actors and the theme of it watching it again with my grandson
B003ODIZL6|4.0|I choose this rating because it was a very reliable resource when you are trying to find a definition. For instance,  I would even recommend this to elementary teachers and students out is that simple. Anybody would be able to use it.
0240810961|4.0|Draw verbs, not nouns. Great advice - backed up by hundreds of thoughtful illustrations that bring the spirit of animation to drawing. So may drawing books are about how to &#34;see&#34; poses. This one is about how to &#34;feel&#34; movement. I think it moves too quickly to be a first drawing book but it is the cure for boring drawings.
B005LAII8K|5.0|I didn't get to see it in theaters, I heard interesting things, I wanted to see it.  Practically anything with Bruce Willis in it is worth watching anyway right? So I decided I'd by the movie to give it a try and it's a lot, lot darker a movie than I thought.  It's got some really tough stuff in here, and it has a great plot, but you have to pay attention to understand all the subtle stuff, otherwise about 3/4 way through the movie the may plot if finally revealed in it's full scope and measure.  Might take two or three watches to get all the little things but it is a movie worth watching a second or a third time.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I love to pop this in when I'm cleaning or working in my office at home because I practically know it by heart!  Season 1 was just the start, but I love to watch it even now that the show is in Season 3.  If you like \\"zombie,\\" you'll love this show!
B009HTPMNK|5.0|DC has done it again!  They keep hitting these animated pieces out of the park!  This one is not necessarily for children, this is from the same Writer who make the graphic novel Watchmen, so think adult themes.  It's years after the death of the second Robin, Jason Todd and Bruce Wayne is a retired Batman looking for thrills.  This is combined with society that has just gone completely down hill, a new gang, the Mutants, have appeared and are conducting acts of random violence beyond anything Gotham has seen in years, finally Wayne's sub-conscious wins out and Batman takes back to the streets to restart his campaign against the lowlifes of Gotham City.  This, along with part 2, is extraordinary animation quality, amazingly in sync with the original works, some parts even looking like exact panels taken straight from the graphic novel.  If you know Batman, you know this story (even if you've not read the book) because this story was the backbone of the modern Batman that we all came to know through the 1980s and into the 90s and to the present day, even in the \\"New 52.\\"  So if you're a Batman fan, this is a must see.  Thanks for reading and have a nice day!
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|I really liked this new show and enjoyed watching it again on DVD.  It turns out I didn't even realize I missed some episodes.  I plan on purchasing season two as well.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|Ok if you haven't seen part 1...What's wrong with you?  Watch it!  Seriously go to the page on the site with it there, put it in your cart, right now...I'll wait.<br /><br />So did you do it?  Great!  You will not be disappointed, because now you can enjoy part 2!  Part one gives you the Foundation for this new Batman's story, old-man Batman coming back after years of retirement to clean up Gotham again!  And guess who's not too happy about it, the President of the United States (this is a time piece the President is Reagan).  For those who didn't read comics in the 80s, here's a scoop, during a good portion of that time the President made a decree that &#34;Superheroes&#34; were to stop their activities because it was seen that the Heroes were creating the super-villains and causing public discourse, all that BS that in the modern age this is no time for Heroes!  Ok keep that in mind when you see this, because it's important, and also get ready for some great political jabs, plenty of guest heroes and villains (some being former villains, but eh...details).  You want action?  You want great one-on-one fights?  You want to see Batman at arguably his very best?  You want to see this!  Thanks for reading and have a nice day!
B005IQZB14|4.0|well done, it kept your interest in her travels<br />through the whole book.  It makes you want<br />take on a challenge of your own.  It also<br />gives you a chance to think about your life<br />and how you deal with family and parents<br />and loss.
B00783NWB6|5.0|I'm typically not a guy you likes to see movies that I think have been overplayed.  That's why if you ask me about say, &#34;Smokey and the Bandit&#34; I'll tell you only the first one is worth seeing, or say &#34;Tremors,&#34; this one, I'm a little more lenient, see the trilogy, skip the 4th movie and the series if kinda mot-so, mot-so, it ain't bad but it could have used a budget.<br />  That being said, let's look at &#34;Underworld,&#34; all three movies, great quality, surprising epic story arch and great characters.  Now take this movie it takes a side step from the others, the Lycan (short for lycanthropy: werewolves) issue isn't the problem anymore for the vampire heroine, not even her own corrupt kind are her problem.  Now humans have gotten involved, and they take no prisoners.  I a world where both immortals are hunted, what can the only hybrids do but try and stay one step ahead of the slaughter.  This story [with some helpful writing by one of my personal favorites J. Michael Straczynski (JMS)] takes &#34;Underworld&#34; into a newer age of storytelling where a whole new set of stories can be conceived and told in a new time where the Immortals are not longer hidden.  Thanks for reading and have a nice day!
B001O0B702|4.0|It's not quite as good as the show itself, but it was so good to see all the old cast together again, interacting with one another.  It was like going home.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and always had trouble putting it down.  I feel there were some parts of the story that developed too slow.
B00BP4WAZS|3.0|I almost stopped watching half way through.  But I'm glad I didn't.  It had a good finish, so it was OK in the end.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Over the at last 30 years, I have read almost everything King has written. His writings draw me in and I get lost in the story.  This story is no different.  The historical references and research were well done and presented.  I learned things from this story that I didn't know, and wasn't taught in any history class. The plot is original, moves quickly and retains that particular King creepiness. It has always reminds me of looking at what appears to be clear water until you look at it from a different angle and see the oily sheen on the surface.<br /><br />I remember my dad telling me &#34;don't live your life in regret - for every day you spend in regret is a day wasted&#34;'.  If you could change something would you? And would the outcome really be different than the original? What if you could influence a major life event that not only changed the outcome for you, but others as well?
0307719219|5.0|I'm not an economics expert so I will speak to this book as a lay person. Why Nations Fail is a new theory suggesting that Inclusive markets and Inclusive political structures are what makes Nations prosperous and successful. By studying the economical histories of nations across the planet, authors Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson put legs under their table top supposition. By the end of this 400+ page manifesto their table has about 400 legs and becomes very hard to argue with.<br /><br />What I took away from this was a comprehensive vision of how successful countries can be sustained or more importantly how failed states can make a turn around to move in the right direction. They do specify that not all prosperous nations or democracies will take the same path nor will the ultimate outcome look the same. What matters is that Inclusive democracies and markets create an atmosphere that encourages personal liberty, social stability and monetary growth.<br /><br />I have heard radio discussions about their book but I have not heard a single cogent argument that disproves it. It seems safe to assume that this work will be influential in contributing to the future of International Economic theory. This is a must read for students of international affairs or political science.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|I had borrowed someone else's after hearing mixed reviews.  I like to take pictures in Raw format and thought they might not come out on the screen but it worked great - haven't tried the UPC connection just the SD card connection.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It was wonderful. Kept me interested from page one. It may be my favorite of all his books. He really knows how you put someone in another world. Loved it.
B00006JL1Z|3.0|This is a great starter for anyone who enjoys Mac's music but doesn't already have Rumours or the 1975 Fleetwood Mac album.  If you have those two albums and Greatest Hits, you pretty much have all the post-Peter Green Mac that you would need, as there wasn't anything significant after Tango In The Night.  Completists however would like the different live tracks.
B00APUQPX6|5.0|This Ice Age is just as good as those that came before it.  Great hummer and plenty of action!  Fun for all ages.
B006DJ2JSI|2.0|I bought the book hoping to use it as my default Kindle dictionary.  It would be cool to be able to hear how the word is pronounced.  But, alas, I found the pronunciations a bit too hurried.<br /><br />Also, I do not like the format.  Unlike the default Oxford Kindle dictionary which lets you scroll down from one word to the next.  This dictionary works like a database.  When you look up a word that definition is given but you can't scroll to the next word.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Keeps me guessing. The plot turns from show to show. I just hated to see one of the leads go though.
B00B16WZBE|5.0|Eric Burdon has always been one of my favorite vocalists.  He puts his stamp on every song and brings back memories.
B000BRBGO6|1.0|I love this record. I always had since it came out years ago. I recently got a record player so I decided to purchase this special vinyl edition.<br />Of course I still love the tracks per se, but I was so disappointed as the first track, Hang Up, started to fade out at the end!<br />What a bummer! Part of the great experience of this album is that all the tracks are mixed together one after the other, as if they were played by a good dj.<br />In the vinyl version, all tracks end or fade at the end, creating a pause of silence in-between songs. Bummer!<br /><br />the pink disk looks awesome though!<br /><br />To be, this is more like a (expensive) collectible item then an actual medium to play the album. To listen to it, I would still recommend the CD experience.
B00BNPZAEM|5.0|If you want to call this a follow-up.  David goes back to Berlin and gets us back in the environment.  Listen with headphones and just close your eyes.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome. I'm addicted to it. I will be playing this game all during my classes. Me and my friends always have compitions against each other on this game.
1451673442|5.0|Life can be ordindinary or full of magic... it all depends on thinking, expectation and reaction to daily challenges... read and think...
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|I like it alot. I would like it more if i didn't have to buy dollars with my email address.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|I completely adore this case for my Kindle Fire HD! First of all, it's real leather, not the &#34;vegan leather,&#34; which feels weird to me. My Kindle Fire HD fits perfectly, and the fact that I can swivel the case to hold the Kindle landscape or portrait oriented is invaluable. Also, it puts my Kindle to sleep by just closing it, no buttons to push. The case has a nice hand grip on the inside that you can hang onto if reading from your Kindle like a regular book, and regardless of which way you swivel it, has special slots to hold your Kindle in place wherever you set it. So, if I stand it up and set it at a specific angle, there it stays until I decide to move it. I could probably write a novel about the myriad positive aspects of this case; however, I will settle for saying this is the best case I have ever owned for any of my devices, including my original Kindle Fire, my Kindle Paperwhite, and my iPad 2.
B008BM9L72|2.0|I found it extrememely boring! It might be enlightning to somebody that knows little or  nothing about BDSM. It is completely over the top and unrealistic.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have always enjoyed the game and the app is free.  I do not like the pop-ups, but appreciate the option to delete them....what more can I say?
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We need more like this!  The streaming video quality was excellent with Downton Abbey Season 3.  Sadly, I've had unresolved problems with streaming video quality on other Amazon TV series and movies.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|It was an intriguing story,but I was not impressed with the writing style.I thought that the ending was unsatisfying.<br />To sum up, it did not match the hype.
B00AN0KBJC|3.0|The Amazon customer service suggested that the poor video quality was due to my electronics.  But, I don't have any problem with other streaming video on-line, Netflix, ABC online videos, etc.  I have very updated electronics and Cox high speed internet (?).<br /><br />Amazon needs to be on top of this with their higher charges for series like this one.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|I was looking for a game similar to Myst and Riven which I played when I was a teenager.  Game went very quickly, but really enjoyed it.  Wish it had taken longer to complete, but I did play for 3-4 hours straight here and there.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This was a wonderful book written by the legendary Chris Kyle!  The stories are amazing, I am so happy he had a chance to write this. A great insight of the true side of war.
1478230096|3.0|&#34;Don't judge a book by its cover&#34; certainly applies here. Looks great, but not so much once you open it. To begin with, the Table of Contents and actual page numbers don't match up in numerous instances (bad editing). I was really glad to see there would be a list of characters with pronunciations; the list seems fairly complete, but still many pronunciations excluded. I actually have not delved into this book very much, once I saw how it started out. If I ever get back to it, I may rewrite my review.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Loved loved loved this book'. Absolutely can't wait for Walking Disaster! Totally fell in live with the characters.  I almost don't want this to become a movie because I'm afraid  it wouldn't be as good as the book!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Simple, easy to use, exactly what I was looking for. Nice, large buttons, well thought out design. Not to cluttered.
B00A0SJWQU|3.0|this was good but the story line in the first was better. Kinda glad i rented it instead of buying it
B004SBULWE|3.0|nice to have but not something i use often. downloaded it on a whim and don't really care about it either way. not much more to say but amazon makes you type x amount of words before you can submit
B00AYB1RGG|3.0|I am sorry but what is going on with the remakes, I am so not impressed, Felt like it was missing something
B008Y212PI|5.0|I Love logic games and this is a great one.  it has great replay value because you can solve each puzzle three times, once at each of three levels of difficulty.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|We bought this on because it was such a fun move for the kids. this will be add to our Halloween paylist every year.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|great movie to watch.  Was skeptical about it at first, but then loved it!  I'd say the best animated movie since Toy Story...well that and Wreck it Ralph!
B009329Y30|3.0|I thought this move would more then what it was. I did like the story though but I wihs there would have been more.
1451695195|5.0|A wonderful book, beautifully written.  I was completely moved throughout the reading and now I HAVE to believe in what Dr. ALexander experienced and wants us all to know -  there IS a heaven!
B00APUQPX6|5.0|this was jsut as good as the others. I dont think that they could ever disapoint my family. Hope there is another one.
1594203334|5.0|I am still not finished with this book, however, we are already putting some of the advice to practice.  Our 2 month old son is now sleeping through the night and we didn't ever let him sit alone and just cry.  I am so thankful that I happened across this book!
B00821PCJS|5.0|This series is worth watching, it does make you think about the future.  glad i had the times and amazon prime to watch it.
B008QTVNUI|2.0|Over the top.  Caucasian female involved with Muslim fanatics?  Come on.  Claire Daines role is not at all believable.  Overrated show.
B004GTOKJS|5.0|Wonderful series, and we love anything that Dame Judi Dench is in.  Great is you are a fan of shows like Downton Abbey.
B001NTUDVI|5.0|I base my review on how many songs I have to skip while listening to the album.  I don't have to skip any.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The trilogy is a truly fantastic read. This final book seems more like a slice of reality rather than a novel with its truisms and insights into the politics of power hungry souls.  And<br /> I loved the answer.
B003QTUQGU|2.0|It was so very depressing. Alice doesn't want to be Alice and everyone is looking for a hero to come save them. I was left with wanting to read the book. The only redeeming quality of the movie is Johnny Depp being in it, and he was ok.
B0066WJLU6|1.0|It doesn't work with my Kindle Fire. May work with others,  but not mine.<br /><br />If you use a different tablet, then maybe it works for you.
B002VRZEYM|4.0|I think the average American would be surprised where they're food comes from, and this movie definitely shows you pictures. There is several spots in the movie that I contemplated what was being said, so it is thought provoking. I did split this movie between two days since it's alot to take in all at once.
B000TETD9Q|5.0|The Beach Boys never fail to impress. There are few of their songs I don't like. If you like this kind of music (as opposed to other types, like heavy metal--which I hate) then this is the music for you.
B00499NHLC|5.0|This was recommended to me and since finishing all the seasons available, everyone I know or meet has watched this. It's a clever murder mystery vs. graphic blood and guts of typical American TV, like CSI.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is great.  I love the graphics.  It is also very addicting so be careful, because before you know it you wil have spent twenty minutes trying to get to the next level:)
B00BHMF578|2.0|Or perhaps I should say the academy disappoints.  Disconnected, unexceptional.  Definitely wouldn't make my best picture list regardless of what the academy thinks.
B00BETX5PS|2.0|Though Amazon claims it to be 5.1 HD....it failed miserably in my audion surround system...does not compare to actually playing a blu ray
0316010669|1.0|gladwell has made too much money presenting theory as fact and i think only outliers had any real significance.  gladwell talks like he knows everything about everything, and thats never a good sign, but what blink says in the first 3 pages is i guess what he says for the rest of the book.  i gave up after about 15 pages because its just one idea repeated over and over until i guess his publisher said, ok thats enough pages.  this book actually made me angry.  lol i was so glad i got it from the library because if i had paid one cent for this it would have been far too much
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Totally gonzo show. Take a good western and move the cowboys to space. Energy guns that look like a sawed off Winchester. Evil empire messing with people's head. MIB hunting you down. Just about every cliche thrown, but still a great show.
B001FA0W5W|1.0|and i thought Blink sucked...how did this get such amazing reviews?  i love the FT and i cant picture them calling it the best business book of the year.  i have only made it through the prologue and i want to find this guy and punch him in the face. honestly, i am sickened that this book recieved any attention at all.  its like being sat next to a crazed narcissist on a plane for two hours while he babbles and name drops without a thing to say.  i only made it through the prologue and that had my jaw on the floor.  i skimmed the rest and was just...ugh...disgusting.  do not read!!
B0027MJU00|3.0|Still reading it- no where as good as Gone Girl and somewhat slow to read-- still have 1/2 book left
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell is right on with this book.  I so related to most of his chapters.  I was able to apply his theory to my own life.
B004M9ZI0M|3.0|I'll begin by saying that anything directed by Julie Taymor is automatically going to be more creative and provocative than most of the films being produced.<br /><br />Taymor's striking style-- extravagant sets and costumes, anachronistic contrasts between story and setting, a preference for in-camera effects rather than CGI--has been ebbing bit by bit, which is quite unfortunate. Her version of Shakespeare's Titus is perfect, and her biopic of Frida Kahlo is gorgeous and heart-achingly acted.<br /><br />Now we have the screen version of The Tempest, which Taymor has directed on stage to great praise in the past. The choice to make Prospero female, and casting Helen Mirren in the role, is intriguing. Mirren's performance lacks power, unfortunately, but it's still HELEN FREAKING MIRREN as Prospero.<br /><br />This is the pattern in Taymore's Tempest: wildly talented people who are not at their best. Alan Cumming, Alfred Molina, etc., simply not at their best. Perhaps there were behind the scenes issues with the producers.<br /><br />For another matter, the cast includes Russell Brand, who may be fitting for gross-out frat-boy comedies, but Shakespeare? I'd rather watch ice melt. He plays one of the clown roles opposite Alfred Molina (who was stunning in Frida), and the pair are terribly mismatched in every way. Once Djimon Honsou's (well-played) Caliban is added, the three mostly just goof off rather than actually create comic relief.<br /><br />The love story between Miranda and the Prince is incidental, but isn't it usually?<br /><br />And there's so much CGI that it turns into a video game by the end.<br /><br />Is it \\"bad\\"? Heck no. I'd watch it again. But I probably wouldn't purchase it. It's just not great, and I am quite disappointed to see lackluster work from a director I've adored until recently.
B003DT19F0|5.0|Im 25, I have 2 sons but also babysit many children. Many of those are girls, all \\"my\\" kids love Tinkerbell and when you have to listen or watch a kids movie it nice when it's a good one. I love Tinkerbell just as much as they all do and hope to collect all. I just don't like how pricey they are :(
1616550414|5.0|Primarily bought the book for the artwork and was not disappointed! For the price this book has given me hours of enjoyment! If you are a fan of the series and have been thinking about purchasing this book do yourself a favor and order it already!
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Good read.  Chris Kyle told his story in written form like he would tell it in spoken form.  This guy gave his all.
B0016J81B4|5.0|I spend lots of hours on my feet in a kitchen. By the end of the day my feet, legs and hips ached. I found these here on Amazon and compared their reviews with some other brands and based on what I read, ordered a pair.<br /><br />Not having ever been a clog wearer they felt funny at first. Now, I wouldn't trade them for anything. They are light as bedroom slippers, don't make my feet hot and sweaty, and best of all my aching feet, legs and hips stopped aching. I love that they are easily cleaned with a wet paper towel and look like new again.<br /><br />When these wear out, and everything does eventually, I'll be back for another pair.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Excellent story line, while perdictable, a good sunday read. Classic Sparks story set in North Caroline's coast, similar setting to other Sparks books
B002PEP4EG|5.0|Tim Brown has been a thought-leader in innovation and design thinking for decades, so it is an honor to get a glimpse inside and learn his POVs and philosophies on the matter.  Change by Design provides a wonderful overview of how design-thinking has evolved, how it's applied in business and the impact this approach can have - not only on product and service development - but on how we might think about solving some of the larger problems facing humankind.  Importantly, Mr. Brown clearly shows how the process can be applied at the enterprise-level so this should be required reading for top management.  There are numerous examples provided from Mr. Brown's own experience at IDEO, although the details are often vague regarding the process itself.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|this is the best game ever it's so addicting to play.;p<br />I fell in love with this game for like 4 ever.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Normally not the type of book I read, but wanted to read it before I saw the movie.  Haven't seen the movie yet, but the book was very good.  Kept me reading
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is a great game. The storyline is mysterious and  intriguing. Graphics are great. I love the mini games.  This is best game yet.
B0031Y9DCS|1.0|Excellent book......having been there, I think it is very helpful for the generation today to read and understand the &#34;Vietnam&#34; war and all it's consequence to the Vets of that era.<br />Also, another good book is &#34;What it is like to go to war&#34;<br />And then read &#34;Xi Loi Vietnam&#34;.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|The graphics are really good. Has a lot of hidden objects to find. The storyline is good. I really like this game slot. It is addictive.
B005HSL626|3.0|It kept a four year old grand daughter intrigued for an hour. (After awhile it drove me crazy!) It was OK
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This app is so amazing that I LOVE it when it wakes me up to the music I LOVE,it is so successful that I rated it as 5 stars.
B003B02O7I|4.0|A wild start that kept me guessing and an even more exciting finish. Grisham is a great storyteller. When I read a book of his I devour it in not many days.
B002VISNLC|5.0|My primary school teacher read this to me and I am now enjoying introducing it to my children and their cousin.
B004SKQAJI|5.0|I went to see the musical in Feb. of 2013. This DVD was just like the musical I paid money to see. They did a great job.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I like this game because it also makes you think, looking to see what moves you need to make.  A lot of fun.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|I loved reading this novel. Very entertaining, clever, addictive and well written. I couldn't put it down. And I really missed the characters, after the end.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|One of us had read the book before viewing, the other had not, but both of us enjoyed this film. It is such a beautiful film, and one that leaves you reflecting.
B008M87GJK|5.0|Once you start reading BBC News you realize how much news -- of every kind -- we don't get to see on US-based television. Countries we never hear of, in Africa, Latin America and under-reported areas of Eastern Europe, are fully covered. And if you're a sports guy, like me, a whole range of games are there.<br />It's one of my first go-to apps of the day. Every day.
B006AN78XS|5.0|What a wonderful way to vicariously visit Paris and travel back to the era of F. Scott Fitztgerald and friends.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I loved all three seasons.  The very end of the last episode of season 3 was disturbing.  Can't wait to see season 4!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Every episode in this series was excellent SF. Rose is by far my favorite companion. The interactions between the Dr. and Roses mom and boy friend are great.
B00BMUYLSE|5.0|I can totally understand how some people would not take to this album right off the bat. It is not \\"Pop\\".  It is clearly not meant to be disposable, like so much of the top 40 stuff.  This album is filled with layers. It is like a great painting that shows you something new each time you look at it. Its not like a billboard that you are meant to look at once, totally understand, then wait for it to be changed next week. For me, this album has all of the finesse and charm and grit of Bowie's career. It takes the listener on a journey.  It uses lyrics to entice the listener to bring part of his or her life to the moment and then wraps it in the richness of the musical arrangement. Personally, I enjoy the mystery of this album. Sure, I listen to Pop stuff too, but it all fades so fast and becomes forgettable.  I feel that this album will linger and be savored by those who are willing to dive in and enjoy it.
B005HED11Y|5.0|I grew up watching original Trek. I'm actually amazed at how well the stories have held up and how good the visual effects were consider how long ago these were made.
B0088XXCZ6|4.0|The subject matter for the songs is a little saddening but the music and the production of each song is interesting.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I think it is the worst book I ever read.  Sex on ever page is a little too much.  It isn't a mystery or a romance or a thriller or a comedy, it is nothing but porn.  I read about half of it plus the last chapter.  That's all I could take.  I hated it.
B00APUQH0W|5.0|Great story, actors, and movie in general. Has some baseball in it, but not totally about baseball. Has a relatable storyline to real life choice people have to make an the outcomes, good or bad.
B006RJTIF6|5.0|This movie perfectly depicts what Americans really need to be afraid of.  Despite being made in the 1960's, it's very relevant to today in that some of our politicians seem to overextend the reach of government since nine elevn.  The 1994 version with Forest Whitaker is also very good.  IT's just a really good story.
B007M45PMU|5.0|I do not usually buy entire albums, but made an exception for the Lumineers.  This band is the real deal and well worth the money.  I just hope they stay true to their roots now that they are a big deal.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|Bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla and bla couldn't finish it. Stopped after three pages.
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|Ended up getting this for my daughter, never really thought it would be something that I also found hilarious. Good amount of retro moments involving games that brought me back to my own childhood.
B004784ZKM|4.0|I've been  along time fan of Genesis and used to have this album on record and cassette in the &#34;dark ages' and had to have a good new copy for my collection
B00992CF6W|5.0|go to 4shared and get it free. Same game nothing but a tiny download and u save 7 dollars.<br /><br />search minecraft when you get there. Only downside is you make an account. But it's a free one.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|Really fun... not too hard. My husband and I are flying through the levels. I hope they get more levels soon.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Just discovered this artist and really he's become my new favorite. His story &#34;Searching for Sugarman&#34; was fabulous. Check it out.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|This show is great, and the addition of the DVD and digital copy is awesome. I was able to send the digital copy straight to my linked Tivo from Amazon.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Of his two recordings, this is my favorite. Really has something to say and the background music is great. He deserves recognition and I'm glad he's finally getting some.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|Out of all the classic bands from the 70's & 80's that have put out new music in the last 5 years like Aerosmith, Iron Maiden, Bon Jovi, Alice Cooper to name a few KISS have far superior ed those bands with MONSTER. It's all killer and no filler. Anyone that says that this album is boring, has production issues or it lacks this and that etc must be hearing impaired. In fact clinically deaf.<br /><br />KISS still has the fire in the belly after all these years and it shows thanks to the commitment of long time KISS members Eric Singer & Tommy Thayer who have given the band a new lease of life.<br /><br />Bring on the next one!!!
B008JFUTT0|5.0|This story was amazing and really resonated with me. Deserved to win the best documentary Oscar. Check this out, really great.
B00BMCLCG6|2.0|All I can say is this album starts off strong then fades into oblivion.<br />Their past couple of albums have been the same. Couple of great tunes, followed by a couple of half decent tunes then yawn!!!!<br />You can tell Jon's desperately trying to write the next big humanitarian anthem too. Sorry it ain't happening.<br />This album offers some killer but sadly more filler.<br /><br />If you want a good hard rock album that doesn't let up buy KISS' MONSTER.<br /><br />Cheers
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I've been using this for a while now as my main alarm clock and find it very good. I like the fact that I can have a number of preset times for my differ shift patterns.
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|WRECK IT RALPH - while I enjoyed the movie I was appalled at some of the things found within - my four year old son was terrified [for the first time ever] of the king candy guy at the end of this show...<br /><br />HEART RIPPED OUT OF ZOMBIES CHEST<br />EXTREME VIOLENCE AND INTENSELY SCARY VILLAIN AT END OF SHOW [MULTIPLE FACES/EVIL]<br /><br />my recommended age limit is no younger than MATURE 9yr old or Normal 11year old.
0061733199|5.0|9.99 and worth it, not small not light but packed full of useful information. Great reference material for all environments
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|thought I would try this,have not made it very far but sure enjoy it.maybe more practice is required or find a younger chauffeur. ?
B0063IH60K|5.0|Its easy to use.  very user friendly.  lots of fun.  I play it often. dont care for the ads that come up...
B00AREIAI8|4.0|it is fun but a little annoying at times.  I don't like how you have to wait 10 minutes to groom or do other things again
B001AX9DT0|5.0|This is an amazing CD. His voice is grainy at times and smooth too. I never get tired of listening to him.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Don't like it. Needs much more work for droid applications. Fix it! And this rating system is silly! Does not work properly.
B008Q00I9O|4.0|Politically incorrect at almost every turn and a bit vulgar as well, but plenty of laughs if your expectations are reasonable.<br />It was kind of retro, resembling some of the shows from the 60 and 70's that used models and miniature sets. Well done and good crafting, Hard to call this an action-comedy since it's models but that's pretty much what it is. Pretty entertaining if you have about 98 minutes to kill.
B00358ESI4|5.0|Not only does it cover real-life military action, but it also covers the wife's standpoint of waiting at home while husbands are off to war. Great scenes, photography and excellent script. Acting from everyone was superb. This movie is a member of my personal All-Time Greatest Top Three Movies.
B005HEPS6A|5.0|You have to love these, they broke the mold when quit making these shows. I can sit and watch these over and over.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|Great action movie,,without the original Bourne, loved the chase scenes and the ending and the locations.  Could have used some Northwest and Southwest locations.  Keep them coming.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a faster update than the Xbox which is cool and I can't wait for next update there will be online servers in April and you can chat :)
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|Quick fun, smooth gameplay on my Kindle Fire.  For those who enjoy popping in for a few minutes of fun every now &amp; then.
B006TJXZ30|5.0|Simply because I am comfortable with it, cannot see the reason to change to outlook.  Seems a lot of folks who have moved over are not happy with it.  Will I change to Outlook, yes if forced to and will work with it, doesn't mean I have to like it.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I like the concept of being able to actually do some of the things people only dream about.  The show makes it seem like these things might actually be doable.  Most people would probably call it science fiction but by putting it in a real, current setting, it seems more plausible.  Just an enjoyable show!
B000J3EEBY|5.0|Uplifting and relaxing. It is really enjoyable.  Her voice is lovely.  The music sounds exotic.  You can hear the influence of other cultures in the sounds and instruments.  It is really wonderful.
B005EGXTL2|5.0|This was a great book I couldnt put it down !! Definately a must read book if you like action / romance
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I read quite a few reviews of Hopeless before actually reading it and i was a bit skeptical because some of the reviews were quite negative and bashed the main characters. After finishing the book I am SO glad i decided to ignore the nah sayers and dive right in and form my own opinion.  I don't want to give a single smidgen of a detail away because knowing any part of the journey this story will take you on won't do this book justice. Suffice it to say I absolutely LOVED Hopeless and i sincerely believe it will be a long time before i can find a book that can come remotely close to being as fabulous as this book was. Thank you Collen Hoover for writing such a captivating story!!!
B00AO2P3GA|3.0|They have made new guns and stuff for updates, but they are only updating it on big appstores only. They aren't updating it for the Amazon appstore for some reason.
B00499QUK2|5.0|It is amazing! intellectually stimulating!! Excellent entertainment!! Acting superb. Exciting!!. Need more.<br />Although, in book Sherlock never had a romantic relationship with The Woman!! That should not have been in show. Otherwise really good.
B009VB7QQA|1.0|I knew, getting into it, that this movie wasn't going to be all that great. Lincoln? A vampire hunter? Nice try, but the makers just didn't pull it off. I actually opted out of watching the last 20 minutes by letting my rental expire.
B000I9W08I|4.0|Great singing!! Not the best of Streisand's movies. \\"What's up Doc\\" is so much better.<br />Walter M is so, so good in this movie. It is worth watching just to see/hear Barbara's entrance singing, \\"Hello Dolly\\"!
B00008CLOA|5.0|This is, hands down, the state of the art when it comes to multichannel SACD. Classic album. Remastered from the 16 original master tapes...let me put it this way: asking how this sounds will elicit a response from me similar to what Buddha did when asked what nirvana was like. He held up a lotus flower, meaning, I can explain something until I'm blue in the face, and you still won't get it until you experience it yourself. So, if you ask me how this reissue sounds, all I could do would be to hold up the lotus flower (or, SACD, in this instance).<br />Buy it. If you like DSOTM and are into audio and perfection in sound, you cannot go wrong.<br />Btw, this is the third copy of Dark Side I have bought. It's the best, my favorite, and the only one I even consider listening to anymore.
0761158820|5.0|hahaha hahhaha great ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ah ha get it it is fantabulous
B007DIQC90|5.0|Stumbled on this group browsing through Amazon... every song is great!  I'm sure we will hear more from this band.
B004BLDD9Y|5.0|Save energy and have good light.  These bulbs have bright soft white light. There is no delay when you turn them on.
B009SZALHA|5.0|This was one of the best buys I have made this year! Her version of some of the classic blues is a great addition to my blues collection!
0770433782|5.0|i love this web page and I am following it everyday that's whay I wanted to so much to have the book! I also recommend it to my other bride to be friends!
B005GFPZYK|3.0|Kyle was a very brave soldier and a very good tactician in war.  His puffery about fights was a bit much but he wrote with honesty and gave a grim glimpse into the war most Americans seem to care little to know about.  His untimely death makes this book even more interesting now.
B00BQPEIT2|3.0|Since I paid for this, I do not want pop ups asking if I want to go to the store and make a purchase. I find the pop ups extremely irritating.<br /><br />Add another character, and do away with the pop ups, and I will give it give stars.<br /><br />The graphics are awesome.
B008133MDK|5.0|I thought the writing smart and quick, the acting suberb, and the chemistry is great.<br />Five more words required.<br />Done
B0018QCXH8|5.0|This movie is a great film. Daniel Day Lewis is magnificent in this as he is in all of his other films.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|My wife and I love this show. She doesn't even like sci-fi but we can sit and watch this together.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This is not the same old nothing games inside the market. This is more of a relaxing game, I love it!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Very fun series to watch. I enjoy all the fairy tales in a new way. I would recommend this series.
0857680986|5.0|This is a great primer for figure drawing. A must for anyone wanting to advance their figure drawing skills to another level..or for starting figure drawing.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Love watching these shows, wish they had not canceled after one season.  The story lines and characters are easy to watch and get caught up in.
B000SLP4SE|5.0|Great Flick! really enjoyed it and highly recommend it. Wahlberg is great as always and the plot is not very far from being believeable!!!
B001FVV2X2|3.0|I love sci fi but this show is a little wacky to me. The acting is pretty good. John Noble (the father and Steward of Gondor in LOTR) does an awesome job. He makes the show more watchable for me. I'm not hooked, but I come back now and again to watch an episode. I'm still working through season 1.
B0011Z31V8|3.0|I'm not Mr. Prince fan, but there are about six songs on here that I like. And the price was right!
B007REV4YI|5.0|After seeing the previous James Bond movie, I consider this the best.  Although, it was over 2 hours long but worth watching it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was on the edge of my seat!  There were so many twists!  Great book!!  Definitely worth reading. Can't wait t  read her other books.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|One of the best CD's I've heard in a while. His music is full of passion and emotion. I even cried during some of the songs.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Go back in time and reflect how the U.S. used to be and what the world would be like if our most beloved President wasn't asassinated.  King puts you on the edge of your seat and masterfully mixes history with fiction.  When will they make the movie?
B0050DIWFC|5.0|William Landry has given us a hauntingly beautiful tale that will resonate with all parents, particularly fathers, who desire most in life that their sons will become young men whose lives are magnificent. I literally could not put this book down, risking a good family meal at a local restaurant by reading a couple of chapters on my iPhone while we waited for the food to come.  I highly recommend this superbly crafted novel.
B004X4R49Y|5.0|I loved the strong emotions protrayed of love of family, love of country and determination to do one's duty .
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I enjoyed the book but I think the author who I understand is British could have done some research. For instance Grey would have been in the care of the State of Michigan, or more properly Wayne Count. Not Michigan State, Universities don't run Foster homes. Also she should have looked into the make up and realities of Detroit. I also noticed several British terms such as pram. Not bad but the mistakes bugged me.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|White Noise is a pretty cool app. It has a wide selection of &#34;noise&#34; to choose from, many recognizable sounds and a few abstract ones. The clips are of a good quality.<br /><br />The only thing I might &#34;complain&#34; about is the wind chime clip. Because the tones are so obvious to our ears, it is easy for our brain to notice the repetition going on. I think this particular clip could stand to be a little longer.<br /><br />I like how the creators have worked in both the relaxing sounds and an alarm clock (which can be one of the white noise clips or a sound from your phone). You also have control over just how long the white noise will play before going quiet. The fade in/out options and screensaver clock are also very nice.<br /><br />Easy to use, quite intuitive. Overall, very nicely done.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|It was such a waste this show never found the viewers it needed. Great story lines, acting, sets and music.<br />Would love to see it revived.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The book is written by 2 points of view:  both the husband and wife.  The author goes back and forth between the 2, while they tell the story.  Which, keeps the reader continually wondering what happens next, but has to get through another chapter just to get to that part, and the cycle begins.  Basically, this book is hard to put down.  Lots of twists and turns.  Just when you're loving/siding with one character, you find something new about another.  Very well written book.  Great read!
B00846F1YW|5.0|I loved this game! Just when I thought it was getting too easy, all of the sudden it would get challenging to keep me on my toes. Had a little bit of suspense too.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|Charming and, so far, a bit predictable. Maybe that's what we need. Morals are promoted. Politics are big part of storyline. Will be interested to see where they go (only viewed four episodes). It would be refreshing to have the lampooning of &#34;religious&#34; characters cease and have the moral theme marry with the true foundation of right and wrong
B0076DCT2G|5.0|As with the previous Corey books, this one is loaded with hunor and intrigue.  Haven't yet finished the book, but after reading Plum Island and the Lion's Game, I am sure this will be just as good.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved every single chapter...the crazy twists you just couldn't predict.  I was in total shock every time I turned the page.  Kind of like a good movie that has you on the edge of your seat.  You just won't want to put it down.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|The show is very creative in the way it presents each new twist on the ongoing battle with fringe influences on the everyday lives of all of us. The actors are all very talented.
B00AEQYM6S|5.0|An incredible composer and Jonas Kaufmann is wonderful singer.I wonder if his voice is more of baryton<br />than tenor??<br />Wesendock lieder so beatiful , though I prefer for example Kathlien Ferrers or Janet Baker.
B008D37J6O|1.0|Downloaded the app to play .mov files but cannot make it work. Kindle fire hd users deserve a better manual for determining needed apps for commonly accessed internet files. App was free at least.
B001FB5634|4.0|My advice is to get Cormac McCarthy's book by the same name, and read it before you buy the movie.  While the movie follows the book quite closely, it is easier to understand once you have read the book.<br /><br />The world, as we know it, has been destroyed by an apparent nuclear holocaust, and the story is told in present tense and flashback memories of how things were before.  While the movie does move along, it is not for anyone who wants a lot of slam/bang action.<br /><br />C. R. Melcher
B00ANGICRE|2.0|But ..... Great plot, but Helen hunts boobs seem to be the movie , I had a hard time liking this movie, dull and boring , I loved Helen hunt in pay it forward, but this was more like a movie of the week for television.

0755337514|5.0|Pointless, really... \\"Do the stars gaze back?\\" Now that's a question...<br /><br />This spellbinding, shining jewel is a magical masterpiece of sheer creative vision and imagination that turns dreaming into reality. Fantastic Faerie and mystical, I was so impressed by this breathtaking book that is simply stunning and a real delight. As supremely singular as JK Rowling's Harry Potter and as mystifying as Philip Pullmans Northern Lights, the exquisite blend of sinister secrets, outlandish and bizarre amid an atmospheric historical backdrop is exceptional. Set in Victorian England, in a small town called `Wall', this is a story of how a young boy became a man.<br /><br />Tristan, like his father, is curious as to what lies beyond the wall that separates his home from the rest of the world. Guarded by a curiously exocentric old man and only breached once before, as Tristan endeavors to cross the wall he does not realize that he will embark on the greatest adventure ever told...Stormhold is a magical land that is extraordinarily rich, exotic, piquant and colorful and yet as well as the otherworldly delights it also harbors deadly foe.<br /><br />Yvaine, a fallen star is sought by many - by Tristan (as a gift for his soon to be bride), by an ambitious Prince and by a Witch who desires youth and beauty. As Tristan Thorn and Yvaine journey through this dazzlingly dangerous land, they encounter both friend and foe and above all discover the real meaning of true love.<br /><br />With a cast of colorful characters this witty, exciting tale is astonishingly mind-blowing and like nothing you will have encountered before; taking `fantasy' to new heights. Inspired and innovative, Neil Gaiman has produced something of outstanding caliber, with the sheer scope and imaginative vision of Stardust to literally take your breath away! With the spoilt brat Victoria and the eager Prince Septimus, the malicious Lamia, the peculiar Captain Shakespeare and dimwitted Ditwater Sal this is a thrilling tale. Full of twists and turns, shocking moments that make you gasp, laugh-out-loud and endings that are just perfect - this is the fairy-tale that just won't behave!<br /><br />\\"What do stars do best?<br />...SHINE\\"<br /><br />(Now a major film, 2007)rilling tale.

B008OURHPY|5.0|This album is easy listening.  I listened to the tracks before purchasing and I was confident in getting it.  Great album!
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|What a great and fun zen game. As long as you take it slow the gameplay is mostly super relaxing with an oh well, try again I can do better if I fail vibe. It's really fun, it looks fantastic on my Nexus 7, and the sound is terrific. Totally a let's slow down at the end of the day and relax before sleep experience to me. It's worth spending some cash on and you won't regret it. Thanks Dev, I'll be keeping an eye out for new releases, this seems to have that rare flavor of unique game making. I look forward to supporting more unique experiences from you down the road. Cheers and good luck dev! Enjoy the game everybody. :-D

B003L0V758|4.0|I got this album because I liked Janelle.  She didn't disappoint me.  Her album is inspiring and recommend it to everyone.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Good mind skill game to help keep the gray stuff in your head from turning into goo, especially when you get past the easy ones.
B005OK721G|5.0|I loved this movie.  I could watch this over and over again and still enjoy it like it was the first time!  AWESOME!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very good read, couldn't put it down, made for a good movie and I am not a big fan of movie adaptations of popular novels.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I replaced a q6600 quad core with this and going from what 90nm? To this 22nm is amazing both in watts consumed idle I'm seeing 68 peak under load 139, the old one would idle at this new one's peak.  Also is is clock for clock 50% faster.  Paired with asus p8z77-v le, 32gb crucial sport mem, 128gb SSD sata 3, 7850 2gb glu and an arctic freezer 13.  CPU under load hit 36c which the q660 would idle at.  Also the entire system is dead silent! Great build for an htpc
B008MEM24S|5.0|This game is very addictive if you have a mind for puzzles and even physics.  The characters involved so not make a difference in how great the game is, since I am not even sure of  their names. The kids know them and found this game for us to play as a free app.  I found myself playing so much that bought the whole game.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|I like having a word processor for the kindle and this is the answer to that and a must have
B003E8P9G0|5.0|This was good.<br />Deep derp derp dermatologist ggd hdhhd duh hdhhd dhhdhhdhh. Dhhdhhdhh ndyhdhhdhhdn Percy Jackson ggd hdhhd hhhh j
B0014LX420|5.0|I love this collection of Britney Spear's hit songs. Purchased this album in 2013 and the songs still energize me to dance/workout.
B006RJTEIC|5.0|Great Story and Great Ending... Before Star Wars but it is a fun adventure of a movie with some meaning to it
B007C7UZIG|2.0|I downloaded this app to have on my Kindle Fire and my Samsung phone and I ended up deleting them shortly after.  I've tried to sign in several times, but it just won't sign me in.  The download on my computer works great, but I wish I was able to have it on my more mobile Kindle.  I'll give it two stars since I didn't really bother getting a hold of anyone to figure out the problem, but then again, when I download an app, I really don't expect that I'll have to troubleshoot.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Watched with my 3 and 8 year old. We loved it! Kept both kids engaged. I will probably purchase this movie for future viewing.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|My wife and I started watching Fringe and really like it. It's like a timid version of X-files, so you won't spoil your dinner if you like to watch these shows while eating. Similarly, it also ends each show with more questions than it answered. Overall, CGI and acting are done well, albeit some stereotypical characters. Lots of humor as well, which is good.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The game us very fun and helpful to horse owners or people who like horses. It also has good graphics and isn't blurry. I would very highly reccomend this game
B007IXWKUK|5.0|When I first started to red the first one I didn't really know about it. I just wanted to see what the everybody else was going crazy about. Then I was hooked and read all three books in a week and 4 days! Love it!
B00AYHKIZ6|1.0|Don't waste your money.  There wasn't a single track that was worth the time taken to listen to it.  Dissappointed!
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|This movie was ok.  The special effects and action were good but I enjoyed the original a little more.  I feel like this movie was leaving a little something out where the original seemed to come full circle in the plot.
B009K0OL06|5.0|She has a purpose, drive and determination to avenge the life of her father, and the life that was taken away from her!
0380715430|3.0|but there was too much gloating about the current status of English. His indifference and smugness about the many languages that are disappearing bugged me a lot.
0375847227|5.0|I bought this for my son in college and he loved it!  It was a Christmas gift that he had asked for and he enjoyed reading it.
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|This is a wonderful game and I really love it! It is a lot of fun! and Just funny! thanks!
B000W74EQC|5.0|My family and I have enjoyed watching Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone over and over again!  We plan on watching all the Harry Potter movies.
B00AK0X5VQ|2.0|there is a difference between relaxing and boring. but try it while its free. maybe boring IS relaxing to some
B00005JLKB|5.0|Smallville: The Complete First Season - we are hooked so we will be waiting for the next season to be for sale.
B009CG96QM|1.0|I stream Netflix and YouTube off my TV no problem, butanytime iI stream anything through amazon iI have 20-30 min waits. 1 star only because amazon downloads suck
B001FB4VZS|5.0|We love Smallville's eighth season and highly recommend someone to buy it.  We have watched Smallville's eighth season three times.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing it's SO addicting!subway surfers is one of the best games I've played and its really fun!
B00821OX98|5.0|Great action, some love interests and killing aliens... short of some gratuitous frontal nudity, this show has it all. My girls like it better than I do, but it is a show we can watch together.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|BEST APP EVER! Right now I am on level 103, each level takes forever now... but in the beginning each level would go super fast and I am just addicted to it now!
B0023S50DO|4.0|Personally I thought it was a rip off of Armageddon, though more family friendly and with Robert Duvall instead of Bruce Willis, so the acting was much better...
B001CEE1YE|1.0|The final disk was blank.  The Matrix Revolutions was blank.  I tried to get it to play on all three of my blue ray players and had the same results.  NOTHING WAS ON THE DISK???
B001L5YW9I|5.0|A timeless classic. The movie kind of drifts from the book, well ok, it really drifts from the book.... If you have a movie date, The Notebook may be the only movie that beats this and it is all &#34;chick flick&#34;. This has big, dramatic music, great action and a young Madeline Stowe all hot and bothered.... If you like it, try &#34;Revenge&#34; with Madeline and Kevin Costner.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I played a lot. I'm a big kid at heart I really like playing Bingo. Infact I enjoy playing games.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I laughed and cried and loved this book.  This author has been put on my list of favorites for sure.
030758836X|5.0|I was wary of reading this book, but I was floored by how much it lived up to the hype.  Once I started I couldn't put it down.  I read with increasing unease as I went from chapter to chapter, getting a little of the truth here and there and knowing, too, that the full picture was going to be sickening.  Every perspective was suspect and self-serving.  My sympathies shifted from chapter to chapter because the truth kept shifting.  However, by the end, one character emerged as very psychotic and deserving of loathing?  Grudging admiration?  Pure evil, I say.<br /><br />Did I feel manipulated by the constant twists?  Yes!  Do I care?  No!<br /><br />I would deem this book as Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf taken to extreme extremes.  The marriage portrayed in it is so toxic, that I was disturbed for hours after I finished it.<br /><br />Not a feel good book but brilliantly written!
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|This is a fun game when you need to fill time. the quest makes you think. However you can use as many hints asyou want in the relaxed mode.
0307950689|3.0|I'll admit it - I enjoyed The DaVinci Code and Angels and Demons very much.<br /><br />I knew going into The Lost Symbol that there was going to be some farfetchedness going on about a secret society and somehow our Founding Fathers will be involved.<br /><br />Aside from the entertainment I derived from laughing at some of Dan Brown's unintentionally hilarious storytelling trademarks. I was mostly left scratching my head wondering about the esoteric WTF-ery pervading this book.<br /><br />***SPOILERS***<br /><br />First of all, who did not guess that Ma'lakh was really Zachary Solomon pumped up and tattooed until unrecognizable?  Supposedly anyway.  I just don't understand how he could have a \\"massive\\" member when he was abusing steroids... but that's just one of the many, many, many inconsistencies I found.<br /><br />Secondly, the lost Symbol is actually the Word is actually the Bible?????  Again, it's the most widely reproduced book in the history of the world.  Why would Masons go to such great lengths to hide this fact?<br /><br />***END OF SPOILERS***<br /><br />There's more, but let's just set aside the logicbending \\"twists\\" and focus on the convoluted plot.  Actually, let's not.  It's giving me a headache just trying to follow the labyrinthine storytelling.<br /><br />I still don't get how the Lost Symbol has to do with noetic science but I would rather bang my head against the wall than re-read this book to piece it together.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|Everybody mumbles in this movie. It was an ok movie, just that.  Glad I didn't pay full price at the theaters, but worth the $4 rental fee.<br /><br />That is all...
B0000E6XH3|5.0|The movie was fun even though I don't usually don't like this kind of animation. Of course, the music was really good and the DVD had lots of cool bonuses! I would recommend it to anyone who likes Daft Punk.
B000006OHL|4.0|I originally bought this album so I could review it for my history of jazz class final. Fans of the film will definitely appreciate the dark and moody sounds of the slums of New York, just as the film portrays it. The only problem I really had with this album is that the main theme is reused a LOT through the album. I wasn't paying attention to the tracks on my first listen through, and a couple times, I wondered if my CD player was on repeat, or if the main theme was actually 15 minutes long. Jazz fans, as well as those who enjoy film noir music, will enjoy this great composition either way, and fans of the film will enjoy this as well. Definitely one of the most outstanding film scores ever written.
B008JFLWLE|5.0|estate buenisima detecta simbolos a la primera vez, muy facil de usar. Y diferente a las demas que precionas botones.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|My kids &amp; I love it! Is even good for my 6&amp;7 yr olds..passes time &amp; is easy to see.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Nice for a quick play game.  Easy to play big tiles . A nice variety of puzzles to play and unlock.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|A lot of action and now want to read The Lion .  Full of interest , like it was almost true.
B0081336FO|5.0|I'm a big Sherlock Holmes fan and this modern-day Sherlock Holmes series is smart, funny, fun, thrilling and just plain brilliant!  The acting, writing, directing and editing are just top-notch.  Each episode is like watching an entire movie.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|It is a nice story of love lost and love found with a surprising twist at the end.  Can't say it was a favorite, but parts made me cry, which is always a good sign.  Like all good books that seem simple, there was more to it than a woman with a past she was running away from.  It also made me examine how battered women feel helpless and controlled, and how it affects their whole being.  A good read that can be finished in a short time, and leaves one with a  smile.
B002CPD5LC|5.0|I purchased this DVD for my father.  He loved it.  Well worth the money.  Picture and sound quality were great.
B00BESM14U|4.0|This movie was good, but it wasn't nearly as moving and touching as the book (of course!). The stuck to the story line of the book pretty well, but Charlie seemed a lot less of an actual &#34;wallflower&#34; in the movie...
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its awsome annnnnnd inrealllllllllllllllllllllly like it alotnbecuz wen I get high then games arevvery fun to jdb djf d d d c f f d
B008TRUDAS|4.0|Well written. Thought provoking and interesting. Most likely an enjoyable read for most older high schoolers and new college students.
B004UXUX7S|4.0|Beautiful scenery of an area of the islands seldom presented.Everybody knows about the &#34;Big Island, but nothing of the smaller islands in the chain.This was fascinating to watch visually as the photography was excellent as well as the storyline, to help explain the &#34;other islands.&#34;
B00AEFXUL2|4.0|Hawks and Wayne made 3 movies from the same script.  They all made money at the box office, showing us all that a good story doesn't have to be original to work.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised when I read this book.  It is well-written and affords the reader many interesting things to think about from the meaning of various flowers, to issues regarding foster  children as well as interesting relationships between a variety of people.  Considering that this is the first novel for the author, I was even more impressed--definitely worth the read!
B003WQT2YY|5.0|I was a very good movies that gave the insight of his passion for music and the destructive envy of another. I would recommend this movie to really see his life come alive.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|This book has me guessing evey page what will happen next.  I haven't finished it yet, but I can  hardley wait to get to the end to see how it all plays out.  I usually fall asleep reading just trying to get to the end.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I think this app is awesome. I love getting free music from it. Then I can also just watch videos and I can sign into my account still.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Nice love story! It was just enouch suspense to keep you wondering what was going to happen next.  Just shows that you can start over and be happy.
B00B7G3Y4U|4.0|I really am a fan of all the paranormal films. I would'nt say this was my favorite one but it was still worth the watch.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Need a quick and large calculator for Kindle, this one works great.  Big keys, easy to use. I Would Recommend this to a friend.
B007I1Q4W2|4.0|The movie seems to be in good shape. No scratches. I'm sure it will work just fine. I just hope something is done about the poster :/
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This story is an interesting period piece about the people that live in Downton Abbey.  Anyone would be hooked immediately.  Great story and great acting.
B00BP4WAZS|1.0|The throw back video game characters are barely used in the movie and it quickly turns into a cheesy, campy movie really aimed and young girls, not boys.  Some recent &#34;kids movies&#34; have done a good job also making inside jokes and story lines the adults can enjoy, but not this one.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|This movie is probably The Best documentary I have ever seen.  Amazing story, almost unreal and unbelievable but completely compelling.  Even if you are not into music history or documentaries you should make an exception for this one it is well directed and worth the rental or purchase. I will recommend this film to others.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This movie is wonderful. I am now adding words so my post will be longer so that it will go through to you, the reader
B002APU580|5.0|I love this movie and just had the urge to watch it.  It was cool to find the movie available for rent through online streaming for really cheap.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|This novel wakes up a new contiousness that will surprise the one who chooses this wonderful book. It is a seemingly simple story. The rather light tale finds the reader engrossed in life changing events and faced with serious questions and answers. This novel is well written and even engrossing. I think the author asks the reviewer to decide what would you do in such a situation when life takes a despirate turn. Read it...you'll love it. SL
B005HET9U6|2.0|I see now what others mean about poor sound quality. In episode The Birthright (Part 2) Everything seems fine until 35:50 where there is a loud crackle and after that it's like watching a poorly dubbed Japanese kungfu movie. I hope Amazon can fix this.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Great performance by Washington. His performance demonstrated great depth and insight into polydrug abuse. It  takes acting to another level. A serious error was made at this years Oscars. A movie worth seeing by all.
0316044695|5.0|Marcus Luttrell did an outstanding job with Lone Survivor. The book leads the reader through Navy SEAL training and then events in which the SEALs underwent in Afghanistan on the hunt for Osama bin Laden's right hand man. This thrilling novel is told from the perspective of Luttrell. The book is very fast-paced and keeps your attention. I never wanted to set this book down when I was reading it. The pictures it paints in your mind are realistic and the battles are very intense. These types of books, ones written by former military who have experienced war first hand, are some of the best to read and definitely make you appreciate the military more than ever. This book is about sacrifice and bravery and should not be overlooked at the bookstore. This is a must read novel.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I love playing mahjong and this version is really easy to play!  I would highly recommend it to everyone young and old.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|This is a different twist on the ordinary crime shows.  Humor, intrigue, romance and much more.  A must see for all.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This is a very handy app,it makes your tablet,phone,a remote control for your main computer,it has two cursor types,a trackball and a point and tap also you  can add a password before connecting to you main computer. To use this app. your computer must be on,with this you can access anything on your computer and view it on your remote device the app says you can access your computer from the net but I am afraid to do so. I use the remote at home to access my main from any room or nearby outside.As a remote this is a worthy app.
B004S9AK3G|5.0|Loved every word! What a great story teller Ken Follett is. His narrative is superb and the research complete. I learnt more about world war 1 in this book than I had ever learnt in school, thoroughly recommend it.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|works very good. is a realy funnctional app.  I love it. realy recomend this app for your tube downloads. ok.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|The story line was good, but, too many errors in the text and grammar. These seemingly trivial mistakes broke the flow of the narrative.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a very addictive game and great for all ages. My 5 year old, 11 year old and husband fight over turns to play. The short puzzle spurts are a perfect way to kill time in a waiting room or between commercials.  Its a thinking game so you don't even realize you are using your brain to strategize!
B005HSL626|1.0|I downloaded the file twice (had to clear out ALL of  my Amazon App data to do this) and both times, it came back with an error saying the file was corrupt.
B00AOEA22I|4.0|The second album from W.E.T. is another very good example of quality modern melodic rock that will easily please fans without breaking any new ground. Featuring the talents of Jeff Scott Soto on vocals with Erik Martensson and Robert Sall from Eclipse and Work Of Art respectively, W.E.T. continues along their path of hard hitting rockers mixed with big power ballads backed up by fellow musicians Robban B&auml;ck and Magnus Henriksson from Eclipse. Nothing involving these musicians is ever going to be bad but the sound of the album is slightly formulaic when taken in context of all the other albums Erik Martensson has worked on recently. One slight negative point for me is the loud harsh sound of the album that I feel lacks breathing room for all the instruments and which makes it difficult to listen to the music for long periods. Highlights include the melodic opener \\"Walk Away\\", the massive chorus of \\"Learn To Live Again\\", the modern rock sound of \\"Rise Up\\" that has a Linkin Park vibe to it, the passionate power ballad \\"Love Heals\\", the awesome main riff of \\"On The Run\\", the killer commercial rock chorus of \\"Broken Wings\\", and the second intense power ballad \\"Still Believe In Us\\" that showcases JSS at his best. I should mention that the massive backing vocals throughout this album are very impressive and used at great moments for maximum impact. Despite the fact that Rise Up doesn't surpass the amazing heights of the debut album, it is still going to please most fans of this style of music without becoming a classic album of the genre.
B0026772N8|5.0|I read this book every few years.  I enjoy the high lighting feature of the kindle to record important passages.
B000TDGGRY|5.0|I like all the sigma force books. I hope james rollins continues with all the characters in many more books!
B005OT2YVA|5.0|I liked the first one and I like the second one even better!  It's full of story and visual effects are just magnificent.<br />My 3 year old son got hooked immediately.  Thank you to the creator of this movie.  This is what the entertainment is about.  I am not at all, being a mother, into playing video games or playing with robots but this one really shook my heart!!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|if they fix one issue more pop up. game is getting to be not worth the problems. can't seem to get anywhere. can't purchase land, can't receive gifts or mail ...
B009VIZDLI|1.0|I was very disappointed with it, particularly after all the hype. The characters are wholly unconvincing - Don is apparently on the autism spectrum but his ability to infer varies randomly from totally absent to very advanced, and Gene's behaviour has not been seen since the 70s - a world map on his office wall with a pin for every country where he's had sex with a woman of that nationality.  Really?  In a university?  The sloppy characterisation and plot robbed the book of its potential for comedy - hard to laugh when you're irritated. Perhaps if it been honestly presented - a screenplay for a lightweight chick flick - I would have enjoyed it more as my expectations would have been correctly set.
B0031RS4UM|3.0|THAT ONE BULLET,THAT ENDED THE BOOK,  300 PAGES EARLIER, WOULD HAVE SAVED US HAVING TO GO THROUGH ALL THAT HAPPENED IN THE COMPOUND.<br /><br />I AM A LEE CHILD FAN<br /><br />THIS WAS THE LEASE LIKED BOOK OF HIS THAT I HAVE READ
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This story isn't finished...it is waiting to be continued.  Wool 1 - 5 in the Silo Saga Book 1 of 5?
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Works great. It's simple and easy to use, understand, and search for things. Even for a newbie like myself. Good Job EBAY!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Hooked on the relationships and intrigue! We look  forward to it every night while regular TV lulls us to sleep!
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|The 'plane' sequence was a little dramatic and unbelievable.  The rest was just not what I expected.  Not bad really, just not what I expected.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I do recommend to read this book is one of the story u will fall in love !!! I can't wait for the next book
B007DIQC90|5.0|I've been listening to this entire album every day since I got it.<br /><br />I'm black.<br /><br />(Favorites: Yellow Light, Mountain Sound, Lovex3)
B00BLGXL3U|5.0|P.T. Anderson is an artist.  Yet again.  The source of this movie is P.T. Anderson's relationship with Robert Altman.  P.T. Anderson's miracle, 'Magnolia', was compared to Altman's, 'Short Cuts' by simple minded folk.  So very lame.  Anderson and Altman later had a relationship whereby Anderson was Altman's understudy on one of Altman's last films, as a way to secure the movie investment.  Anderson decided to embrace the comparison but somewhere inside he did not like it.  'Magnolia' is amazing and frankly unbelievable to me.  So beautiful.  I don't know how he did it.  'There Will Be Blood', another masterpiece.  Anyway back to my point, this is not about Scientology, it is about making movies, :)  The giveaway is when the main character is a department store photographer after WWII.  PT Anderson = Phoenix, Robert Altman = Hoffman.  The Master himself seemed to be a bit of a hoax by the end wouldn't you say ?
B00A1XOPE8|3.0|The story in and of itself was inventive but lightweight. I'm not sure Sanderson's style lends itself to shorter fiction. So three stars for the surface.  I want to give this story five stars though for its insight into the process of finishing or 'forging'  another person's work. Read it as a metaphor for Sanderson's finishing the Wheel of Time and it's altogether brilliant.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I really like this game but I'm having issues. connecting and I'm. not happy. I want to play my games now. This really makes me mad.
B00849F82E|5.0|He's my guy. This guy could really write. I would recommend this to any who are interested in good books.
B0049U4NQO|5.0|Great m m m m m m hmmmm  m m m m m m  sorry wasting words but there a lot of idiots in this book
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I am overwhelmed by how amazingly AWSOME this APP is there are a gigantic amount of characters, boards and things you can do in this game! And there is an update every month people I tell you this APP is a must have!!!!!!!!!!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|not bad but not the most addicting bunch. have not found a favorite on this yet. will keep playing and maybe find THE one
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Although the first one dead on arrival(middle button can't roll up and down), they sent me a new one in no time, even before I return the old one. I just sent an email, and the next day my new mouse was on the way(amazon prime 2days). The mouse itself is excellent. i can't list any cons so far. Highly recommended!
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|This film was amazing, the visuals were stunning the story line was great. the film has things to offer everyone no matter where you are from. great for families as well. three thumbs up
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Ordered the entire series on a whim....Absolutely fantastic!  I'm totally addicted.  Can't wait to read more by this terrific author!
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|i just wished it had more deleted scenes. i love deleted scenes.<br />i would recamend this movie too everyone. it's great..
B007WPM7SO|5.0|Enjoyed this mini series.  Historical twist of fate during early 1900's.  Two lives meet at the wrong time. Circumstances unbeknown to one keeps them separated through the trials of the First World War.  Would recommend to those into historical mini series as well as those who just enjoy alittle historical romance drama.  Surprise ending.  Not going to tell you. You'll just have to watch.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Cannot wait for Season Four.  The writing, the characters, the costume designs.  It all adds up to one incredible series that you don't want to end.
B008133MDK|5.0|The acting in Sherlock is some of the best I've seen. Dry wit and excellent delivery! If you haven't watch Season 1, do that first. You won't be sorry!
B00BHMF578|5.0|To know that this was based on a true story draws you in.  How this one man takes on the safety of these people inspite of the CIA orderingi him not to keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is very addicting and fun! I only wish I could get more coins faster! I can play this while doing other things, like watching tv or riding in the car.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Denzel always chooses movies with great scripts and this is one of them.  He finds that he is caught up in a second addiction to cover the first addiction and not until he hits the wall does he recognize the lives he has distroyed including his own.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|This is another example of not sleeping because I watched all the seasons in a week  there were four seasons!
0937381888|4.0|Lets face it, Palmer (and Jamil) are pretty much THE go to sources for homebrew knowledge.  This book is a required piece of any home brewers library.  Very detail instructions, adds updated info to the free version that can be found online.<br /><br />I found some contradictory information within the pages though so thats why im giving it four stars, but a homebrewer with even minimal experience can read and decipher the instructions.<br /><br />Otherwise the book progresses at a nice pace for the home brewer with any level of expertise and paves the way to increase they're knowledge base and also set the foundation for more advanved and radical brews.
B00BKTWBMA|5.0|I have been listening closely, to Eric Clapton's work since I was 12 years old, I am now 56.  OLD SOCK is another example of what a really great musician Eric is.  OLD SOCK is a peaceful album but has the special, unique Clapton of old guitar perfection all smoothed off.  The musicians in Eric's band make this record just as good as any and I love the female vocals toned down as it is here.  More please Eric!
B009BJAPLK|5.0|In an era where DNA testing solves all crimes, this refreshing adaptation of the eccentric Holmes reminds us that evil has different masks in our post-modern world. And for each cunning and evil character revealed, there is a solution: &#34;Elementary, Watson, elementary!&#34;
B008Y73940|4.0|Kept me on the edge of my seat....then the AHA moment was great. Even after reading the book, I enjoyed the movie.
0062082353|5.0|Enjoyed every chapter. Make you really aprreciate what veterans have had to endure to ensure our freedoms and liberties. C
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|good movie for teenagers! lots of drama and good special effects. kids loved it and asked to see it again!!
B009NNG202|3.0|This was....interesting. Not a great movie because of too many times of being uncomfortable while watching it, but interesting in that it keeps you watching to see if it will get explained.
B0042TV4IW|3.0|OK at times, but plots seem thin and characters are everyday boring.  More of a Little House On the Prairie flavor
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love the characters and the story. It's fun to see how people lived at that time. To see the relationship between servants and Employers.
1609611543|5.0|Every time I see an overweight or unhealthy person, I wish for them to have Wheat Belly.  This book helps folks to understand the need to be on a wheat free diet.  It helps not only weight problems but health problems.
B00BB8SKPW|2.0|Well acted enough by the main players, but never rose above being a dismal, run of the mill story of a drunk in denial, who happened to be a pilot.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I recommend this book to anyone who likes to read or also anyone who does not like to read. I love it!!
B0010SKUYM|4.0|Entertainig, thrilling and make you want more. Two minutes after finishing the first book, I bought the next book in the serie!
B008OUTQ6C|4.0|She is something from another planet. Her voice reminds me lf Lalah Hathaway but more original. I saw her on VH-1 soul and I immediately went to my Amazon store to download it to my Kindle. I have definitely got to give her other albums a listen. I love the song about the old man doing what she tells him to do. AWESOME!!
B007EECSFA|3.0|Very slow, wasn't a page turner as her other books have been.<br />Took me weeks to finish the book. Finally started skimming just to finish it. The last few chapters brought me back to the book and enjoyed the twist at the ending.
B001RHPJBU|5.0|What can be said about the legend, who is Phil Collins. He is an amazing musician and singer. He is funny and entertaining. This is an album full of his solo hits. I danced and sang to it as I cleaned the kitchen. If nothing else Phil Collins makes housework a whole lot more enjoyable!!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Love stories like this based in history.  Feel like I learned about what happened during this crisis, AND highly entertained at same time
B00AHXIC50|4.0|My boyfriend and I listened and argued over who his major influences were. I said Prince, he said Stevie Wonder. Either way...it's all a compliment to how diverse his musical stylings are. Some of his songs are upbeat and fun, some of them brooding and painful. I would absolutely suggest this album for pop and r&b lovers.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I used this paste in rigging my PC, it keeps the system cool even at 4.5GHZ day and night without external cooling
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|this game is fun... I play it a lot. I really enjoy. if u guys get this game then avoid using SLOW MOTIONS. Once they run out , u cant get any more unless u use ur own money.....
B0071XO8RA|1.0|I'm mystified as to how this got so many 5 star reviews (maybe I would if I googled, 'How to get better reviews on Amazon').  It *is* well-written.  The first short story is really poignant, but it all really should have ended there.  The rest of the world is as dull and claustrophobic as you'd expect it to be, and that's not where I would like to spend an extended period of time.  It's like a dystopian 'Little House on the Prairie'. Next!
B0086213XW|3.0|I like both of these actors, so I enjoyed seeing them on screen.  I thought the best part was actually played by the sister, Sarah Silverman.  It was slow at times, and I didn't really buy the relationship or the characters so I guess I wasn't crazy about the writing.  It's worth seeing if you love the actors.  Michelle William's character kind of bugged me, I felt like she needed to find her thing in life rather than try to fill it with the men in her life.
B000JMKNJ2|3.0|Basically that.  The prose itself is good, the characters are well-characterized, the world is intricate - but seriously, the plot *does* drag a bit.  I especially dislike how he (like so many far more mediocre writers) likes to break up the momentum of the plot with long, rather tedious chapters full of fairly irrelevant flashbacks and other assorted bits of stuffing.  It would have been *more* than adequate for the reader if he had condensed all the history and backstory into a chapter or two. I give this book a solid \\"Meh\\".
B009RI4FRU|5.0|There's something wonderful about the combination of Anderson's quirky character based comedy, and his lovely stylized  cinematography. A fantastic film!
B007W1BLN0|5.0|Human search for meaning only to find that is boils down to something that already was known.  What we were called to do by God.  Love one another.  What is love.  Sad story but very common question that I think everyone faces some time in their life.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book will pull you in on the first page and you will keep turning the pages just to see what happens next
0843178140|5.0|All the little Miss and the Mr Men books are great as they promote good behavior and consequences.  I grew up on them and now my kids love them.  They are timeless.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|This game is a lot of fun.  I love match games and puzzles. Bring us more just like this one.  THANKS
030758836X|1.0|Terrible.  Don't even bother.  I didn't even get past the end of the first section before I gave up.  BORING.  Don't waste your money.  There are much better mysteries out there than this one.
B00B2DSIAI|4.0|What M family liked was the idea of all the videos games coming together. It was a easy score of 4 stars, only because everything can be inproved. Thank You Disney!!!
B006885EFE|1.0|Ridiculous to have to pay per episode. I thought I was paying for the season. Paid for 1 episode and then found out it was almost $5 per episode. Outrageous!!!
B0054SMIH6|5.0|It held my attention the entire time and made me think.  I liked seeing how M.M.'s character worked out his &#34;end game&#34;.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|View<br />How many stars would you give 'Fringe: The Complete First Season [HD]'?<br />We hope you found this message to be useful.
B0018RC7QE|5.0|5 star rating for sure!  Meryl and Robert are two of my favorites, and they really work great together to make this movie a success.
B004529NKC|4.0|I really like dancing movies.  In this one the dancing didn't seem like anything new from Step Up 2, but I love the story of Moose.
B003VPWXRO|5.0|You will see Portia in a different light. This book is so deep and<br />well written. Her food problems,death of her father and need to<br />grow up fast to take care of her family are interesting and learning experience.<br />If you have food problems ;anorexia,bulimia,..this is for you.<br />Well done Portia!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Never thought I'd watch a show based on zombies, but the characters and stories are great. Will continue to watch.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I'm a huge music listener, I average at least 20-30 hours a week and I always hated wearing headphones because nothing sounded anywhere near as good as my surround sound. After using this product for a little over a month now I can say its better than my $700 surround sound! Everything is crystal clear and I hear things I've never heard on the track before, even on songs I've listened to hundreds of times. I now almost prefer to listen to music on my headphones!<br /><br />On a small side note, If you like heavy metal music like myself and are concerned about your headphones carrying over the dramatics of bass drops and breakdowns, this does great!
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|I had seen reviews recommending this movie so we gave it a try. Not funny, crass and the humor seemed aimed at 8 yr olds who are eligible to see an R rated movie. This was a total waste of Mark Wahlberg's talents
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Nicholas Sparks is a wonderful author and his books can be read by all ages.<br />The Best of Me is one of his top books.
B006GECE9Y|5.0|When installed along with  flash player, it can play videos on any site which is great!! I wish Silk could do that!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Very addictive, I would highly recommend this series to all my friends. I don't know if I could just watch it one show at a time.
B005HSL626|5.0|Awesome app! This is very addictive. Everybody in the family  love  this app ... get colors and entertaining game ..get it!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Very addictive, I would highly recommend this series to all my friends. I don't know if I could just watch it one show at a time.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|This was an interesting book with some insights.  I had high expectations for it, but was left feeling dissatisfied with the outcome.  I hoped for an extended summary of events or a clarification of motives for some of the characters.  However, it is well written,
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|After dealing with my 4 button mouse I decided to move on into a gaming mouse. After looking around and doing some research I stumbled upon this mouse. I was quickly attracted to the led lighting, it's button layout, and of course its price.<br /><br />After owning the mouse for over a month it's been nothing but perfect. The mouse feels great in my hand, the quality is not missing, and I love how easily accessible the buttons are.<br /><br />The software I downloaded after plugging in the mouse was also just as equally phenomenal. I was able to customize my mouse in so many ways, I didn't even know where to start (insert kid in a candy store simile here)<br /><br />Great mouse, you won't regret it, great deal all around.
B004QX07G4|4.0|I liked it for it's lack of stuffy pretense.  It is funny and clever, just like Ms. DeGeneres.  It is an obvious easy-read.
B009Y7YC2M|1.0|I tried using it for some homework and I couldn't I have a big speech coming up and it didn't work on my kindle fire. don't waste ur money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0762445262|3.0|I was a little disappointed when I got this one. This wood be perfect for play with an action figure as it is to scale for a 4'' Batman. I was looking for something a bit more brighter. If you have it less than a foot away from the wall you can make it out. Any futher and not so much.
B00B5HQL50|5.0|Another classic James bond film. Lots of action with a good twist. Definitely recommend to watch either alone or with the family
B007REV4YI|5.0|Sean Connery is still the ultimate Bond.  Daniel Craig is a close second; he takes Bond back to his roots -- physically tough, handsome rather than pretty.  When it comes down to it, he understands duty and honor.  This Bond is more about the man than the gadgets.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|Interesting dramatization of what might have really happened behind the scenes. Good acting all around with an interesting take on the relationship between husband and wife.
B00APUQH0W|4.0|Sentimental good time. Good way to get ready for spring and baseball. Especially sweet if you loved and miss your Dad.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|An entertaining and historical novel as the second in a trilogy following Fall of Giants.  His perspective of World War Two from the experiences of the British, American, and German characters who went through World War I.
B007KOLNXC|5.0|Can't wait for the new season to start.<br />Watch this now so you'll be ready. Check local listings for April date.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wow if I had to rate this book I would obviously rate it.....<br /><br />1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 stars!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Here are 5 final words:<br /><br />Wow wow wow wow wow!!!!!!!<br />P S<br />This book has 8 parts, Auggie, Via, Summer, Jack, Justin, Auggie, Miranda, and Auggie again.
B006TJXZ30|3.0|For my purposes, hard to use on my kindle. However, it is terrific the way it synchs with my Kindle Calendar. Worth having just for the calendar function.Better than gmail, but not as good as the mail client built into the Kindle Fire HD.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Josh always seems to amaze me.  His wonderful voice has no competition in todays music field.  He is tried and true!
B001OGWY1W|5.0|This is an excellent continuation of the new Batman series.  The acting is excellent and very enjoyable. It is a good lead in to the Dark Knight Rises.
B00B23O96A|5.0|There's always been something about Eric Clapton's approach to music I always found very appealing. It can even be summed up in a single sentence. He's extremely expert yet subtle in his musicality. This is a man who has chaired guitar festivals,played with Beatles,Steve Winwood,Cream,Deleny & Bonnie,Derek & The Dominoes and a number of Chicago blues icons. This man has SERIOUSLY been around! He's even been referred to as a musical god. Listening to Clapton's catalog,enormous twenty years ago,is almost too overwhelming to consider today. Again you have to include a huge solo catalog extending back to the early 70's,his group activities and contributions to soundtracks and albums by other artists. He is ever the troubadour. However when I heard he was coming out with a new album,featuring the usual guest list of musical friends he's bought into his orbit over the years,I thought I'd give some new Clapton a try-if nothing else but to see what this iconic musician was up to these days. It certainly wasn't a disappointment.<br /><br />  He starts off with \\"Further On Down The Road\\",which literally has Taj Mahal written all over it from the reggae/soul combination of the rhythm to the man appearing on both as the songwriter,harmonica and banjo. \\"Angel\\" brings in J.J Cale for the same effect on a country rock influenced number. Clapton and Cale have a very similar approach and sound and together it's the aural equivalent of a well mixed liqueur to here there sounds together.  The Broadway classic \\"The Folks Who Live On The Hill\\" has a very jazzy blues flavor with a lot of quiet drum brushing. \\"Gotta Get Over\\" is an interesting number-a fierce and funky blues rocker featuring Chaka Khan on back round vocals-a women who was once vocally not a huge fan of the blues. How things do change.  \\"Till Your Well Runs Dry\\" is a quieter type of reggae on the Peter Tosh classic. Paul McCartney himself guests on upright bass and vocal harmonies for another jazzy blues take on \\"All Of Me\\"-one of my favorite pieces on the album.<br /><br />  That same flavor extends into another similarly done standard in \\"Born To Lose\\" before going into Gary More's \\"Still Got The Blues\\",a hauntingly soulful ballad featuring Steve Winwood's chill inducing brilliant Hammond organ playing. The sweet n sour country style \\"Goodnight Irene\\" is follow by a reggae/soul take on Otis Redding's \\"Your One And Only Man\\",featuring Taj Mahal again on blues harp. \\"Every Little Thing\\" extends that flavor on a more modern song where the finale is \\"Our Love Is Here To Stay\\",another jazzy blues treatment of the Gershwin standard. Overall this is a superb interpretive classic. Clapton's playing has aged like a fine California of French wine ,despite the opinion of some people, his singing has actually grown even more into itself. Guests like McCartney and Taj Mahal all make wonderful and sometimes unexpected musical contributions to this. It's a wonderful example of Eric Clapton's ability to maintain his talents fully even with the passage of time and many recordings. Whatever one wants to call that intrinsic musical quality Clapton has,he's still got it.\\"-one of my favorite pieces on the album.<br /><br />  That same flavor extends into another similarly done standard in \\"Born To Lose\\" before going into Gary More's \\"Still Got The Blues\\",a hauntingly soulful ballad featuring Steve Winwood's chill inducing brilliant Hammond organ playing.

B0045XGRQE|5.0|This is a great continuation of the Iron Man series.  Good villain adds the quality of the movie.  Robert Downey Jr. has the right attitude for this role.  If you like this and other other Iron Man, check out the rest of the Marvel movies (Avengers, Thor, Captain America, etc)
B008AX1HD8|4.0|Good read, but Harry gets a little on the dark side at times. I will now look for more from Jo Nesbo and follow Harry.
B003L77G6A|5.0|This is the only series that has held my interest since the days of Seinfeld. A perfect show for techno geeks and the like.
B00AH8FTT2|5.0|Very good read , there is no way this is the end of the series too many questions unanswered. Get writting Jeffrey and give us the final fourth book of a three book series.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who deals with persons with dementia whether personally or professionally. I think that Lisa Genova did an excellent job of letting us see life from the perspective of a person with dementia.
B00BHMF578|5.0|We should all go see Argo!  It happened when I was in college and I did not even know,,,,it was a great reminder!
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Flight is a very good movie i give it 5 stars of five. Denzel Washington is a good actor .
B008476HBM|5.0|While my favorite Austen is Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice has perhaps the best writing and character development of all her novels. Mr. Bennet's descriptions of his family are priceless! Mrs. Bennet is so richly drawn a comic character! And the foppish pastor, Mr. Collins, who goes on and on about Lady Catherine De Bourgh's patronage and condescension to the point of high comedy! Elizabeth Bennet is a woman before her time - strong, independent, outspoken; no wonder she is her father's favorite. A wonderful read!
B000FBFN0Q|4.0|Some reviews talk this book down because the financial ineptitude hits close to home, the character is irresponsible, or whatever else. Let me point out, this is fiction, and yes, the main character has money issues, but nothing over-the-top that I couldn't stand to read! I thought the story line went at a good pace, there was every element I love in chic-lit, and the author knew her fashion. I am not amped to read the baby sequel though...
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Acting, costumes, action, historically (almost) correct- intrigue, mystery, romance, this is one of the best series I have ever seen.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I know movies can be considered an art form, a way to make a social/political statement, and/or a means of experimenting with style and content.  But let's face it -- many of us go to the movies not to be educated or culturally refined, but to be entertained.  I know I've enjoyed my share of brainless but fun blockbusters, such as the \\"Transformers\\" film series and the \\"A-Team\\" movie, and will gladly choose a Pixar or Disney movie over a more \\"arty\\" foreign film.  There are wonderful, art-worthy Oscar contenders that I will probably never watch again, simply because though I acknowledge they are good, they just weren't fun, while less artistically impressive movies will become a hit with me because of how much I enjoyed myself watching them.<br /><br />\\"RED\\" is not an Oscar contender, and has absolutely no pretense of making a statement or considering itself high art.  But it's a blast nonetheless.<br /><br />(For the record -- no, I have not read the comic series this is based on, so I'm judging the film solely on its own merits.)<br /><br />Frank Moses is a \\"RED\\" (Retired, Extremely Dangerous) CIA agent, trying to grow accustomed to a quiet civilian life and having slightly flirty phone conversations with Sarah, the customer service agent at his pension office.  His attempts to relax and enjoy retirement are shattered when a hit squad attacks his house one night, sending him on the run.  With a rather reluctant Sarah in tow, he makes a cross-country trip to round up his old CIA buddies -- Joe, terminally ill but still kicking; Marvin, paranoid and deliciously crazy; Victoria, an elegant and soft-spoken \\"wetwork\\" agent; and ex-Russian secret agent Ivan.  As they put together the pieces and discover their team is being hunted down due to their connection with a military disaster in Guatemala, Frank is being pursued by young CIA agent and family man William Cooper, who follows orders with chilling precision but is seemingly unaware that he's being used as a tool by higher forces...<br /><br />By far the best part of this film is the cast, containing such heavy hitters as Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, Helen Mirren, John Malkovich, and Richard Dreyfuss.  All of them look like they're having an absolute blast making this movie, and sling hot lead and sharp one-liners with equal zest.  John Malkovich chews quite a bit of scenery as Marvin, easily making him one of the funniest characters in the film, and Helen Mirren shines as Victoria, obviously having fun being a proper lady with a machine gun.  Richard Dreyfuss has only a few scenes as a smirky weapons dealer, but he hams it up enough that he's quite memorable.  Morgan Freeman plays against type as Joe and has relatively few scenes for being one of the top-credited names, and Bruce Willis seems to be running mostly on autopilot as Frank Moses, but they're still both fun to watch and have some good lines.  Mary-Louis Parker is sweet and spunky as Sarah, and Karl Urban (probably best known for \\"Star Trek\\") is mostly playing straight man to the rest of the crew as Cooper, but does his job well enough that I can see him carrying a \\"Bourne\\" style action series on his own.<br /><br />The film operates solely on \\"Rule of Cool,\\" eschewing realism for over-the-top explosions and loads of gunfire and fist-swinging action.  I don't particularly mind this, as I was enjoying the ride too much to nitpick at any errors.  This film knows what it is, and never has any pretense at art or high-minded storytelling.  The downside is that the plot tends to fall by the wayside in favor of fight and shoot-out scenes, but there's a good deal of humor, character development, and even a sweet romance to make up for any deficiencies in the plot.<br /><br />Very fun and entertaining action flick, with good actors and memorable jokes and scenes carrying the movie quite well despite the fairly weak plot.  If you want a fun action flick, \\"RED\\" is a good choice, with something for just about everybody.  It's not going to win any awards, but it's sure going to entertain you.<br /><br />P.S.  There's talk of a sequel... and reportedly when Helen Mirren was asked what it would take to get her into the sequel, she said \\"just send me a script.\\"  I can only hope something good comes of this... :Dt going to win any awards, but it's sure going to entertain you.<br /><br />P.S.  There's talk of a sequel... and reportedly when Helen Mirren was asked what it would take to get her into the sequel, she said \\"just send me a script.\\"  I can only hope something good comes of this... :D
B002JIOQCO|5.0|Every song is amazing , I love WOLFMOTHER , Best CD i purchased in a long time What an amazing 60-70s Rock sound they have!  AMAZING, my young son asks me to play this cd all the time !!
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Really did not get into it until I was halfway thru then it became a mission to finish and I ended up really liking the book - great story.
B00942X8PY|3.0|Simple, minimalist design and easy to understand rules creates an easy (and time time wasting) experience. Recommended for puzzle junkies and design snobs.
B001NLKWLW|4.0|This covers four generations of women, the last two trying to uncover the mystery of the earlier ones. It skips back and forth from generation to generation which got a bit confusing.  I often had to go back and refresh my recollection of a character's place in the story. However, I found myself caring for them and involved in unraveling the mystery. The ending was satisfying but a bit pat.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Works great love the fact I am not always having to be plugged in to wall to charge that is awesome
B009NQKPUW|5.0|... and turn on a light for this one all. Put the wee one's in bed... this one will have you covering yer eye's!! Excellent movie if yer in to horror!!
B0074MZSWW|1.0|I liked what I had heard of this band. I saw them on SNL & than listened to their samples on Amazon. VERY unhappy with the recording quality of this CD. It sounds like I recorded it myself from an old AM radio. I have never heard such poor sound quality on a CD. Who the heck was the sound engineer for this band??! Don't waste your money.
B0051OZ564|5.0|It's different, and you may need to watch it twice to get a clear understanding... but in the end... you will get it. It's a really good movie. I was definitely surprised as to how good it was. I'd recommend this to those who enjoy a good kick butt - gal movie!! Even the guy's will enjoy it. It's that action packed for all!
B005NFWCSK|3.0|Of three-star quality. Deserves 3.5-3.75 stars, to be honest. Features WWII themes and, of course, mutant powers. Worth watching for sure.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I absolutely love the walking dead! I had to cancel my cable and was really upset that I could no longer watch it but then when searching for any new episodes, I found that amazon had the last two episodes that I missed and was just absolutely ecstatic that I could actually watch them! I am glad to pay the $2 an episode!
B0094K1WZE|4.0|Tend to prefer the more thoughtful dialogue driven movies and watch the big special effects type things for pure escapism.  Pleasantly surprised how engaging this was - and I'm not much of a TCruise fan, either.  It's a fun watch, pretty people, some awesome larger-than-life settings, not too much time spent on the obligatory car-chase - and done in a huge sandstorm is a fun touch.  If you just want a little light entertainment where you don't have to think but can still get some enjoyment, you could do much worse.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Catching Fire was a good sequel, but I thought it lacked a lot of the suspense and action as the first. I would still recommend it to anyone.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Kept me awake, what will be next, glad they added some realistic thing. Don't read if you are shy about sex.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Not totally implausible.  Well, maybe totally implausible, but fun never the less.  Just enough actual science to keep you on your toes!  LOL
0307887448|5.0|The story is fast paced, engaging, and chock-full of 80's geek/nerd culture.  I couldn't put it down, and finished it in one weekend!
B004JN1CW4|3.0|It's bleak, and it has too many twists for it to be likeable. Also, a little confusing at times. The quality of the books since the first just went down.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|Everybody should check these out. All of the content i have seen in TED tasks has been exceptionally valuable. There are ideas here that are definitely \\"worth sharing.\\"
0375836675|5.0|The first few pages of the book caused me to laugh for about week. I would start laughing for no reason just remembering the book. Markus Zusak is a genius, and this book is extremelly inspiring. The feel of the story is great, and the emotional charge is grand and beautiful. This is one of few books that can make you cry as well as  burst out laughing in a matter of minutes. Zusak takes the point of view of a 19 year-old cab driver, who has little prospects in life, and you read on as you see that character evolve into someone that you can deeply admire. And the dog in the book is just awesome. Fantastic read.
B0017XOF5A|5.0|I already owned this movie in DVD wanted to up grade to BlueRay hope that they will make another movie
159514188X|4.0|It's gripping, and it's also very emotionally charged. Although bits of it are just too dramatized. I recommend reading this, as you'll gain useful information on how to know when someone isabout to do somenting stupid.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|I was just going online and using facebook but it was difficult to navigate. When I downloaded the app I found it was more like facebook on my desktop. It is much easier to use.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|It seems like the days in the story have 56 hours each. Too much happens in a way that is not beliavable in a single day, and it is annoying. If Morgan Rice had actually thought about this, this stoy could be sooooo much better, and actually a good read.
B006MW3V6U|3.0|5 stars for the show. Yes, 5.<br />But only 1 star for not offering subtitles.<br />I have a hard time understanding their &#34;proper&#34; English and I'm not alone on this one. Others do as well.
142311339X|4.0|A good comeback for Riordan, adding more characters and visiting old loved ones. Jason, Leo and Piper are great, but the best part of the book is the ending, which gave me the best news in some time.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I'm all for a good romance series, but this was just poorly written and the storyline just blah. Maybe it's my OCD that compelled me to finish all three books but I honestly, couldn't wait for it to end. If you have anything else on your reading list, read that first.
B005HHSXP0|5.0|I dare you not to like this book. For Percy Jackson's fans, the wait is over. I have to say, though, that the flasbacks are a little annoying.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Loved this book. Just as good as the first one, if not better. I can't wait to read the third one! These books are definitely worth the read.
B001GA1RFA|4.0|John Green has a way of building his characters that makes them incredibly interesting. The boy-prodigy is a great character. All in all a good read.

B008J34466|5.0|This is a Great cd and a good price, shipped quickly, Made for a great gift! need four more words
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|By now we all know that Riordan is brilliant. His decision to keep Percy as much involved as possible is also a winner. He is the heart and soul of this story, and whithout him you just keep reading to get it over with. Don't get me wrong, the other characters are all great, but that's all they are: &#34;other&#34; characters. The chance to pick Annabeth's brain was great, though.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I am now on the third season and watch it every morning and nite with my dog barney as he sleeps.  Would love to have lived in that era.  Life seemed so much simpler and more family times.

B00A77II0U|3.0|I have this on my Kindle Fire HD. Now here is the problem it won't work off line. So, unless you have wireless, anywhere you go, which I don't, I can only use this at home. Now, if you don't mind that this is a good game.

B007QJ8VBI|5.0|So much today on media is trash. Only wish to shock. we are losing our civuilization in the crudeness that prevails. I remember this movie from my childhood and my wife and i regularly seek solace in Gary grant, Doris Day, Bing Crosby etc movies that you have on our immediate demand list. Thank you. We enjoyed it very much.
B007NZ7LIY|1.0|I am very disappointed in this game, it does not work on my 1st Generation Kindle Fire. The sound is all messed up ! I tried to remove it then reinstall it back to the kindle but with the same results, I wish I could get a refund for my $ 2.99 ! I have never had any problems with any of my games. This is a first and there is no way I know of to get my money back or to get a credit ! once you buy it you are screwed.

B00B23O96A|1.0|This is a sleepy collection of dreary songs at best, it should be real popular down at your local retirement home for sure, the one question that Clapton fans have on the tip of their tongues is, \\"why?\\", why bother to continue to put out this kind of record?, I guess he is about ready for that retirement home himself.
B00867GHS8|5.0|I loved this movie when it first came out and fell In love with it again when it came out in 3d . Can't wait to rewatch it for years to come
0307744434|5.0|One of the most unique and beautifully imagined tales that I have ever read.  Torn between craving more and keeping the originally authentically unique.  I very rarely re-read books, however, i suspect that I will be re-visiting the Night Circus sometime in the future.
B00867GKIK|5.0|Loves the movie and the shipping was fast<br />Amazing 3d quality makes you feel like you travel with them. Great movie to watch with anyone

B00BP4WAZS|5.0|A ton of references to older games for the adults, and a very cute for the little kids. Highly recommended!
B003EVWDR0|1.0|Well, sort of: I checked the Amazon Prime listings for new movies, saw Avatar there, and started watching it. Turned it off after about two hours, intending to finish watching it the next day. Found out the next day that Amazon wanted $12.99 to finish watching it. Was Avatar listed as free by mistake? Dunno. The situation reminds me of the &#34;Friends&#34; episode where they were getting &#34;free porn&#34; on their TV and were afraid to turn of the set lest they lose it....<br /><br />As for the movie, while visually spectacular its plot elements seemed extremely derivative, I can't say much more because I haven't seen the ending.
1419705849|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR BOOKS IN THE SCHOOL LIBRARY. EVERY TIME MY DAUGHTER WENT TO GET IT IT WAS OUT, IT REALLY WAS EASIER TO ORDER THROUGH YOU AND CHEAPER THAN ANY STORES HERE. WE GOT IT D<br />FAST AND SHE READ IT IN ONE NIGHT, THEN DONATED IT TO THE MIDDLE SCHOOL LIBRARY FOR OTHERS.
B006LSZECO|1.0|after dealing with the unusual twists in who did what, that gets you switching who you are rooting for<br />it was wierd some of the way the writing was done, I didnt like either charachter at one point but I stuck with it and was so frustrated<br />with the way it ended I felt like I had put in a lot of energy trying to figure this out and keep reading for what? I went back 3 times to see if I somehow skipped a page..I was like it cant end like that really? I must be wrong..<br />I ofcourse did not reviews until AFTER I read the book but I agree with those that said Gone Girl is more like Gone Ending?
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a very handy little app.  I like the fact that the keys are large enough for my fingertips and the display is readable without glasses... lol awesome. Everything else on this works just like a real calculator.  I give it five stars!

B0084U0IEG|3.0|I love Ian McEwan's writing, and read his books as soon as I can, but I found these characters boring and the time period uninteresting -- no doubt because of its familiarity.

B005LAIIHG|3.0|I've given myself a few months to digest this film, since I feel as though my initial response to it may have been jilted thanks to my unapologetic adoration of the novel.  Jilted in a bad way, since I felt this paled in comparison and so I was almost angry at the film for being critically successful.  Taking these few months to let it all marinade, I have to admit that not a whole lot has changed from my initial feelings.<br /><br />While reading `Life of Pi', on a plane coming home from Europe, I was spellbound.  Page after page kept me intrigued and absorbed and engaged and completely in awe of everything being expressed and expounded on.  The journey and magical quality of it all was one thing, but the spiritual undertones and the way it beautifully developed the themes of faith and God were so articulate yet never condescending or overbearing that it all felt so effortless.  Up until that point, I had no real interest in the film adaptation that was fast approaching, but after putting the book down I was overcome with this intense desire to see Lee's film.  When I saw that it was a PG rated film, obviously directed at families, I was a bit hesitant.  It's not that the novel was extremely graphic, and yet in parts it really was and I just couldn't understand how you could try and make this a family film.<br /><br />Still, I had to see it.<br /><br />For those unfamiliar with the story, the basic premise is this.  A young boy named Pi (pronounced Pee) grows up in India on a zoo with his family.  At a young age he becomes fascinated with the idea of God and faith and religion and begins to study and practice multiple religions in an attempt to bring himself closer to God.  When his family decides to sell the zoo and move to Canada, Pi finds himself on a boat with a crew that dislikes him and a slew of animals in cages awaiting their destiny overseas.  During a terrible and unexpected storm everything goes awry, Pi's family is killed and he is left destitute on a life boat with a hyena, zebra, orangutan and Richard Parker, a Bengal tiger.  For 227 days, Pi has to learn to survive alongside this beast.<br /><br />It is an intriguing tale and one that it mostly approached from an angle of respect, and I must admit that the way Lee visually crafts the film is marvelous, but outside of those visuals I found the film to be almost shallow in its presentation of the more intimate and important themes of the story.  The core of the story is lost in a film that becomes redundant and superficial.  I think a big problem with the `translation' of the film is that the key segments on the book are all internalized.  You read the thought patterns of young Pi and you begin to become entranced in his world.  In film it isn't always easy to convey internalized transformations and so the outward redundancies (yelling at the tiger, starving, fishing, yelling at the tiger) carry less weight.  While there is tragedy at the center of the film, it became almost too focused on the visuals and so it lost the heaviness needed to carry the emotional side of the story.  It became pretty, but empty.  I also found the changes to the story to be unnecessary.  Pi's love interest was a ridiculous inclusion, especially since there is no development of that story and so their separation carries no weight.  I also found the whale scene to be kind of pointless, yet pretty, and while I understand the idea of creating tension thanks to the aftermath of the scene it just didn't do what it set out to do.<br /><br />The way the film is spliced is also somewhat irritating, although I'm sure it was developed to try and add some interruption to the redundancy of Pi's struggle.  The constant shifting from present to past and the use of Irrfan Khan (elder Pi) as a narrator for many of Pi's actions felt forced and took me out of the story, to be honest.  It also took some of the key moments in the book (like the adventure on Meerkat Island) and condensed them to the point where they were almost pointless.  I understand the need of narration to explain certain things that visuals won't readily explain, but these segments were so short that they almost trivialized their inclusion.<br /><br />I'll admit, the conclusion is still heartbreaking, and when the big question is asked, \\"Which story do you prefer?\\", I can't help but feel the lump in my throat.  I also can't help  but reply, \\"I prefer the story Yann Martel told me!\\".<br /><br />Still, `Life of Pi' is a beautiful film.  The visual effects are some of the best I've ever seen in a film, and for that it richly deserved its Oscar.  I take issue with the cinematography Oscar, since the skies and sea were all created by the visual effects department, but whatever.  This was purely a director's film in the end, and so for that I guess Lee's Oscar shouldn't be all that shocking to me, although I really don't think he deserved it.  He may have created a visually arresting film, but the core of this film was not a visual one but an emotional and spiritual one and he failed to tie those ends together (for me).<br /><br />Despite the heaviness of the actual prose, there is something `slight' about this interpretation.here they were almost pointless.

B008NA3I30|5.0|I'm not sure how this got such a bad rap, but for some reason people have fun hating this movie.  With an average rating that plateaus in the middle, and 43 `1 Star' reviews, you'd think that this was a pretty awful movie and yet I found it to be one of the best films of 2012.<br /><br />Seriously.<br /><br />What I love so much about `Take this Waltz' is the ability it has to be wholly honest about so much without ever beating us over the head with it.  It presents us with a conundrum of sorts, delving into a relationship that feels very authentic and very natural.  Margot and Lou live in a cute little house in a cute little community and they have a cute (at times bizarre and yet that is really the most authentic part) relationship.  The film opens with Margot meeting Daniel on a plane and winds up having chemistry she wants to ignore because she married only to have that chemistry take over when she realizes Daniel lives right across the street from her.  While she loves her husband, it's the little things that corrode every marriage and soon she finds herself entertaining the idea of an affair.<br /><br />I find it rather ridiculous that people take issue with the representation of Margot here, claiming that just because she's a woman she's portrayed as a victim and if she had been a man she'd be seen as a villain.  It's kind of like the people who griped about `Brokeback Mountain' being easier on the main characters because they were gay.  NO, that isn't what is going on here.  `Take this Waltz', and `Brokeback Mountain' as well, look at the situation from a particular angle.  Instead of focusing on the betrayed spouse, these films look at the difficulties that arise in the minds of the one doing the betraying.  Here we see the constant back and forth that comes when Margot tries to talk herself in and then out of her affair.  This is natural and real, raw.  It is believable.<br /><br />The film doesn't stop there though, because it really gives us a look at the chaos that is caused in the lives of all those affected by Margot's actions, including her own, which is really why I take issue with claims that she's portrayed as a victim.  She suffers the consequences of her own actions and we, the audience, are allowed to pity her because of that.<br /><br />We can thank Michelle Williams for that.  As Margot, Williams finds a beautiful way of exposing the guilt her character feels as she flirts with an affair she continues to tell herself she will not venture into.  What I love so much about what Michelle does here is that she never once plays up the victim card despite allowing us to see her tortured emotional stance.  You feel for her, but not in the way you might expect.  She doesn't vie for our sympathies, she merely exposes both sides of the affair through the eyes of a woman torn.  Her love for her husband is never doubted and yet she continually doubts herself and that leads her to doubt her marriage and her husband's affections and her eventual catastrophic decisions.  The film is beautifully composed and reflects on the affair from a purely unbiased eye, which is refreshing.  To all the naysayers saying that this affair is portrayed as a woman's self-discovery as opposed to the devastating act that it really is surely missed the point of the film.  There was no discovery other than the obvious; that the grass isn't always greener on the other side.<br /><br />Those bookends just kill me!e chaos that is caused in the lives of all those affected by Margot's actions, including her own, which is really why I take issue with claims that she's portrayed as a victim.

B0052AC8C6|5.0|Absolutely Awsome. This show teaches the value of telling the truth - in a sense. It teaches about forgiveness and about what it means to believe in someone. Good and Clean fun.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Even If you think you knew Steve Jobs and Apple, should still read this book. You will learn some stuff.
B0070R40V6|5.0|Book was outstanding.<br />The features are also very useful, in terms of referencing the appendices.<br />Would definitely recommend to anyone.
B000VZFYDC|5.0|I know that this will piss a lot of die-hard NIN fans off but \\"With Teeth\\" is my favorite album by the band. I can listen to this cd over and over again from start to finish and enjoy every track through and through...don't have to hit the skip button once...just an amazing collaboration of music. I can't understand how people can hate on this album.
B006RJTIF6|5.0|For someone who grew up with the atomic threat over my head, this gripping tale of planned military coup made many of us re-think who the real enemy might be...or become. Lancaster and Douglas...two of the finest actors (and friends) of old Hollywood made this movie a hit with their timing and quiet intensity. The movie should be remade, but I don't know of any actors who could carry it off with making it seem a caricature of the original.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game sooooo much i would die to keep this game out I love this game it is awesome.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Loved it, loved it, loved it. I have super high hopes for the resurgence of this series, and the redemption of my favorite character Special Agent Aloysius Pendergast. The most previous offerings were enjoyable for me as an avid fan, if a bit muddy with the plot directions and lack of true substance for the dynamic main characters. This book gets right back on track and tidies up a major mystery, as well as restores Agent Pendergast to his former glory by giving him his usual dose of hutzpah. Well done!!!
B0091REZMW|2.0|I have not been able to play the game since I downloaded it so my rating is not good ..0....star

B00BFUUMO8|2.0|The app is free but it comes with no instructions. I guess it assumes you know what to do and trial and error is frustrating.
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|Kids are know what they want. Wreck-It Ralph is a huge hit at the house! This is a Home Movie to put on anyone's list.
B0054SMID0|4.0|Worth watching.  Entertaining and well acted.  Not a happy flick by any means, but I don't mind that in the least.
B005HSL626|5.0|I still enjoy playing this with my son, he is 6 years old.  This will definitely be a game that will stay on this Kindle for awhile.

B007N5YIUS|5.0|What can I say, its an Angry Birds game.  Everybody loves them.  The thing I will say is that the &#34;FREE&#34; is starting to get annoying because of the AD pop ups.  The Kindle Fire is linked to your account of course so my son would buy stuff on &#34;accident&#34; for variuos games depending which one he is playing.  My son is 6 years old.
B00633W614|5.0|This book has held my interest from the first moment I opened it.  I love this series and can't wait until the next book comes out.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Definitely a popular game with my 6 year old.  He talks about it with his friends at school.  Good job Rovio but same gripe about the AD pop ups.
0545265355|5.0|You find out why. Many of flick happenings are left to you-the viewer to figure out,very incomplete. Not so if you have the books.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Definitely a fun game.  I play this with my 6 year old sometimes.  I do have the same gripe about the AD pop ups as i do on all the other FREE games.

B006YTTVHO|4.0|I thought the information provided was very good. I work in a very public job and have to deal with people one on one and in groups. It was a very quick and easy read. Some of the information was repetitive.
B0085Z8F4A|2.0|This movie could not have been more of a disappointment.  With Ridley Scott I thought it was going to be a smash.  It made no sense, the characters did things that no one would really do and I was not really impressed with the special effects.  Overall, I was bored, pissed and tired of watching.  The script obviously had very little thought put into it as characters do and say things that they should never do.  The whole story is just dumb.  I would not even recommend renting this, that is how bad it is.  Go on with your life, you miss nothing by not watching this crap pattie.
B00B19DMUE|3.0|The movie looked and sounded good. A few jump out and scare moments that were okay. Jeffrey Dean Morgan did very well, but I am a fan of his so i might be a little bias. The wife was just a nasty person, and it distracted me from the film. It was not necessary for her to be that insufferable. This movie is worth watching if you are in to this genre, otherwise you will probably be kicking yourself for wasting your money.
