B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is such a cool and fun game. I love building game apps and I love this movie, so it was easy for this game to become an instant favorite. Easy and a lot of fun to play with. I can't wait to see more animated movie game apps in the future.
1442359919|4.0|Joyland by Stephen King is the story of 21 year old virgin Devin Jones who spends the summer and fall of 1973 working at the North Carolina amusement park.  Jump on board for Dev's journey - it is a coming of age tale; of lost love and love found, of new friends, of ghost stories, of murder and of the fate of a dying child that will change his life forever.<br /><br />The audio book was narrated by Michael Kelly.  It took me some time to warm up to his style but by the end of the almost 8 hour narration I thought he did an excellent job.
0385347774|5.0|I couldn't put it down after a few chapters.  It certainly left me wondering.  I would love a sequel.  Excellent reading.
B009LDD54K|5.0|The first two seasons were great, but this series just keeps on getting better and better. I love the clothes, music, and Americana so closely researched for this series. It is a great history lesson.
B00DHHFKE4|1.0|I NEVER write reviews but i felt obligated to save another person from wasting money on this trash. The only reason i gave it a star is because i had to. Couldn't even finish this book. Terribly terribly dry and she feels the need to remind us that shes blonde, privileged, went to smith, has plenty of people that love her and basically her prison mates are beneath her. I don't even understand how this book got 4 stars (probably from her many friends) Piper Kerman you should be ashamed, even more your publishers should be ashamed to have even released this mess. Again i say DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. The show on the other hand is very much worth your time.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|The plot just keeps on doing gut wrenching turns keeping you on the edge of your seat. Unpredictable and well written plot, great characters and acting, and close ties to real life make this one of the best series out there.
014312093X|5.0|This is, quite simply, in my humble opinion,  the best spy novel ever written. And one of the best British novels of the last half century. It says profound things about the Cold War and about political power. It gives an extraordinary insight into British society between the 1930s and the 1960s, subtly mapping its class divisions and post-imperial decline. Yet it is also a 'page-turner' that will keep you awake into the small hours. Anyone prepared to make the mental effort to understand a different time and place will find reading Tinker, Tailor a deeply rewarding experience.
0802473156|3.0|I believe the author outlined his intent to make an easy , common sense approach to love. The book is believable and even inspiring. I would recommend this read to anyone , even single people
B000W93CHC|5.0|I am actually worried that I can not possible do this story justice in my limited review talent. I extremely enjoyed this story. \\"World Without End\\" sat on my book shelf for months and I did't pick it up because of it's weight with over a thousand pages. However when I did pick it up, it was difficult to set it down. When I finished it, I wished that there were a thousand more pages to it.<br /><br /> This story is the sequel to \\"Pillars Of The Earth\\", although based two centuries later in the same Kingsbridge, England. If you read and like \\"Pillars\\", I think that you will love \\"World Without End\\". It begins in 1327 when Merthin, Caris, Ralph, and Gwenda witness a fight in the woods between three men of arms. The author, Ken Follett, takes the reader along with these four lives to the year 1361. We live through the deadly plague, war between England and France, and the struggles and commerce of a growing community. Mr. Follett is a brillant story teller. I felt the love, the hate, the greed, and deceit of the people of that day. While reading it I came to realize that it was not much different from today with it's religion, nobility, and peasants. In fact this era laid the foundations for our present day society.
0793563836|5.0|Bought a bass and purchased this book very simple to follow and now I can play with eases the DVD that comes with it is so helpful also if your a beginner this is the way to learn
B0034DGPEU|4.0|This was a very intriguing novel...quite a few mysteries and secrets between the characters that live and work in the main setting, and the &#34;kitchen room&#34; isn't exactly what you think it would be, but it is a place that you think you would definitely want to explore.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is awesome it has everything and it helps me read the Bible and gives me good verses to read and helps me share The Word.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I love match 3 games and this one is a lot of fun.  Easy and quick - great for those times when you need a quick distraction!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love it best game ever it is like temple run but way better than it I like the battle with the robots
B0082Z447U|5.0|If you enjoy mysteries then this is a must read Title. It has it all- love, intrigue, plot twists, etc. what I liked the most is Collins ability to draw the reader into this bygone era of 1850  The characters become your friends and their enemies yours also.  Yes it is a long read and a style most readers today aren't used to, but it is well worth thr effort!
B00498YZH8|3.0|We enjoyed it, well made - good story - kind of scary but that didn't turn me off - characters were interesting.
B00006AUIG|3.0|Session 9 started out kind of scary but it tended to drag on in some of it's scenes.  Seemed almost like one of those ghosthunter series  where you never really see the ghosts
B00005N6KG|5.0|I stock up on these - light and nothing sounds better doesn't cost much. Great under a bike helmet (not safe but fun).  Bike carefully.
B005LAIGOQ|5.0|Loved this movie and love Daniel Radcliffe's filmwork.  Wish he would do more movies.  I like the dark and dreary atmosphere of the town where he is sent and the spookiness of the house.  It is also more appealing as he is desperate to keep his job and provide for his son. Wish they had shown more of the woman in black herself and a little more detail into her son's life before he died.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|Just an okay movie...strange ending - - - kind of romantic / pretty scenery.... drama/romance type film.  Date flick. You'll like it.
B002ZG9774|5.0|I have seen this 4 times and decided I had to have it.  Music is good, dancing wonderful and actors are wonderful.
B008FRFN7A|3.0|It's nice to be able to print, but its Web support takes some getting used to.  Setup took some time to figure out.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|I love to dance.  This really appealed to me. I really liked both Cher and Christina.  The plot was good and I enjoyed the many personalities that were involved.
B00003CXBH|5.0|After seeing the movie again after many years, I had to have the Two-Disc Edition to listen to at leisure. What a joy to have it so I can play it whenever I wish. Thank you for the prompt delivery.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Good fun game, bit slow sometimes to recharge. Passes the time. Need more credits to speed the game up. I would recommend it, good free game.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My niece and some of her friends kept talking about this series, so I finally decided to give it a try on Amazon Prime. I started with Season 1 Episode 1, and thought it was interesting, but I wasn't 'hooked' at first. The more I watched, the more I WANTED to watch! The casting is excellent...all characters totally believable, and the story line has enough twists and turns to keep you from becoming complacent. When I catch up to the current season, I plan to keep watching!
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Imagery, plot, acting, music--The series is tight and engaging. I watch crime shows and usually I know who the perpetrator is. Episode 7? Amazing.
B00C6B7GTE|1.0|This is quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. I was amazed that Jeff Bridges, who I generally like, even consented to make it. I found nothing interesting about the character, a foul mouthed, aimless and thoroughly worthless bum who has no redeeming qualities as far as I could tell.
B004I9G486|5.0|It takes a while for this to get from China, but it was worth the wait. Tupac lives in all of us
B008NA3HZ4|2.0|I found this story about a casual encounter that led gradually rapidly to an attraction and eventually to a torrid sexual affair to be an interesting concept, but to me the gratuitous nudity and explicit sex was unnecessary. Overall I did not much care for it.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This game is fun, but energy runs out fast and they expect you to use real money to buy crystals to replenish it. It's annoying.
B00EAI9CSY|5.0|i really enjoyed watching this movie. it was a different take on the vampire and i found it interesting. i loved the ending, but i wish there was more to the story!
B0053ZOQMK|5.0|Kids love it and so does mom and dad, we love buying our own movies, rentals are a crap shoot a lot of them are unwatchable because of scratches so it's nice to have your own videos
B000Q66JXA|5.0|Have always loved this movie, Very pleased with purchase of Blu-Ray Disc, Picture is much clearer than on DVD. Great Seller !! Will use again.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's a great why for kids to learn to take care of animals with out having a pet. So I love this app because it teaches them things that you would have to do if you had a pet .
B0014J8D9Q|5.0|Movie was just as stated. Very happy with purchase, Will use again. Wish I would have gotten on Blu-ray instead.
B00ET9T2WK|2.0|Not sure if it's just me or the this game really sucks. I really think this game  is not for me maybe it's more for guys so girls if u are girly and looking for something interesting this is probably not what your looking for.
B003ELKNH2|5.0|This Version is Awsome, has plenty of unseen footage not shown in regular version of film. Great Seller !!! Will Use Again !!!
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I'm very pleased with the quality of sound and noise reduction. I bought these to wear while mowing and riding my motorcycle. Does a great job of limiting noise from both.
0307010856|1.0|I ordered this book for a baby shower (Bring your children's favorite childhood book).  It arrived the day before the shower - too late to return.  Pages of the book extend 1/4 inch beyond the edge of the cover.  Definitely not a first quality book.  I did not order a discount book  - paid full price.  I expected a 1st quality book.  Very disappointing.  Will never order a sight unseen book from you again.
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|This game forces the player to think outside the box and be creative with their solutions.  Very well done game!
B006AZZPCM|1.0|I cant use this app like the last version. the creators or developers made so much worse in my opinion.
B003UESJH4|5.0|The history here, with QueenElizabeth's father is amazing.  The king's struggle and eventual friendship with his teacher<br /> Is all heartwarming...excellent even if you are not a history buff!
B000JMKNZQ|5.0|Although this book can be redundant is some passages it is mind altering in others and forces you to not want to miss a thing.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Chromecast in short, is a poor man's media player and not a very good one. If you can spend $50, just buy a Roku. If $35 is your limit, Chromecast may suit you. ( of course if you have Internet TV, you don't need either).<br />Google does search and has largely 2nd rate products in every other space.<br />Chromecast  does only one thing - stream Netflix and YouTube playing on your mobile device to your tv.<br />If you have a Roku or boxee or WD tv live, you don't need it. If your tv is Internet enabled - you don't need it. If you have Apple TV, you will hate Chromecast.<br />If you have a small PC connected to your TV with XBMC installed, you will find Chromecast silly.<br />And that's the point - This is a silly little product with nothing of value.<br />I don't have Apple TV so can't say how setup is on it.<br /><br />I have a small net book connected to my TV. I can play all my music, movies photos on TV. I installed XBMC and now I can stream movies, music from my ipad to my TV.<br /><br />Chromecast in short, is poor man's media player and not a very good one. Don't buy if you can spend $50 for a real media player.
B00F35BV64|5.0|It is not often that a new director takes am older legend, and pumps new life into it in such a way, that the new saga outshines the old. JJ Abrams has does it!! In a big way..New stars, new story, new twists and turns, fun all the way.!!!
B001C4AFOY|5.0|This was a beautiful, touching, true-to-life story. If you like British history and admire the royals, you will enjoy this movie.
B0033CTKHG|2.0|I've heard of this film but had never seen it until now.  it seems like a Hodge podge of  of different plots pasted together to make it look like a whole movie. Hard to follow, very corny
B000N4SHOE|5.0|This is really a charming and must see movie for those who enjoy romantic movies that entertain without gratuitous sex. Just a sweet story of where love can lead two kindred souls.
B000WEH74G|4.0|It was a tad slow -- even for a Japanese film of the era. I enjoyed it, but must admit to fast forwarding through the last 30 min.
B001PJRAUS|2.0|I am a real Jane Austen Fan and have read her books over and over. I've seen almost all of the movies made from her books. This one was just too irreverent for me. I found it amusing and clever, but hated what it did to the memory of Jane Austen's books. (To be fair, most of my friends disagree with me...)
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Awesome.  Very much like the eighty's video game.  The only thing missing is the track ball.  Hopefully more updates will come in the near future.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|A very fun read. Quite enticing, especially for any old school gamers.. The pen and paper kind. A book worth paying for.
B002WV5A9G|1.0|This is not a movie for people over certain age. This is a movie for children and maybe for teenagers. It's so boring that the special effects didn't save the day.
B00CTT9646|3.0|This review is about the Phaser prop provided with the Limited Edition Gift Set only. The prop itself is heavy and sturdy, possibly made of resin, but it's finish isn't like the ones at the movie. The body painting is best described as an \\"opaque metallic grey\\", not the polished surface resembling stainless steel as seen in the movie. Also it's finish is quite irregular, some parts are well made but others are poorly finished (the \\"stun barrel\\" in my prop is not perfectly aligned). I find it just ok, far from spectacular as the advertise made me believe.
B00CL68QVQ|1.0|Boring, predictable, unimaginative, repetitive, abuse of stereotypes...This is the only thing I can say about this movie. The performances were very good, but that's it.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|1000+ page book?  Yes, please!<br />1000+ page book, that should actually have been a 300 page book?  No, thank you!
B00C81LYH2|5.0|this is a special gift for my daughter we get one every year for x mas the service is great with my amazon they are on the ball  shop with them all the time.
6304711905|5.0|This movie has become a family favorite over the years--the kind where an amusing quote occasionally come up in conversation and everyone knows where it's from.  The story has been done many times, but this version is still unique.  Great cast, great script.  And not excessively violent, given that it's a western.
0811879542|5.0|This is a great fun interactive book for young children. I first found this book in a diagnostics kindergarten  room while subbing, and one I saw how excited the kids were about this one, I knew I had to own it. It is perfect for children of a young age, kids who are mentally challenged, downs syndrome, ADD, ADHD, children who have a hard time following a story really get into this book. I work with young special education children and this book is always a hit in the classrooms.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|People may say that the game costs money but I spent a week collecting gems for rarity and almost have a million bits
B00EOO55GW|5.0|I admit, the first time I heard the single &#34;Hail to the King&#34; I was scared. I wanted something that was more Bat Country, I wanted something with The Rev's type of writing, I wanted the ultimate Avenged Sevenfold album. Though I always loved classic metal, I really wasn't sure how to feel about the song. After a few listens, I got into it, but I was still fearful before the albums was released.<br /><br />But on release day, I immediately downloaded the album and waited till I had time to listen to the whole album straight from the beginning, hell, I'd turn down my XM Radio to 0 when &#34;Planets&#34; or &#34;This Means War&#34; would come on. I wanted my listen to be as fresh as possible (title song didn't count to me as that was more like the trailer to the album). So when I actually sat down to listen to it, I was star struck. Once I stopped thinking about what I was afraid of what the album wouldn't have (it would have been unfair to ask of them to write like the friend they lost, that we all lost) I started to love it. It was dark, it was medieval, and it was a strong classic metal album. This was something I didn't know I wanted. It brought back my hope that metal would return to the roots of it all.<br /><br />The album has a strong central theme, a story, something I crave and love. When I play this album, I can't help but think and feel of the Skeleton King from Diablo and Diablo 3. It's a gothic taste while still retaining that Metallica feel, that Led Zeppelin inspiration, and that Black Sabbath heart. Though &#34;This Means War&#34; does sound too much like &#34;Sad But True&#34; by Metallica, it's still unique enough to stand mostly on its own. &#34;Shepard of War&#34; is an awesome start to the album, like a war cry for what's to come. &#34;Doing Time&#34; I'm not entirely sold on, but it's still a fun song and has more of that high energy.  The rest of the album is great.<br /><br />However, the songs that stuck out to me was &#34;Hail to the King&#34; &#34;Coming Home&#34; &#34;Planets&#34; (the creepiest of them all) and &#34;Acid Rain&#34; as each has a very distinct sound and brings the album together. However, my favorite song is by far &#34;Heretic&#34; as it does have the most Avenged Sevenfold feel to it and some of the best guitar playing on the album. I love this album and I know a lot of other fans may hate it, but we can't choose how our favorite artist chooses to grow. That was my mistake when I listened to the single &#34;Hail to the King&#34; and that's very unfair to Avenged Sevenfold. They are growing whether we like it or not and I have to say, you guys are great and thanks for delivering one of my favorite albums of all time. I wish Arrin was given a better chance to show his true chops, but I do understand more articulate drum beats may have broke the classic feel to this album.<br /><br />Either way, I say only one thing to Avenged Sevenfold and this album, Hail to the F***ing King!King&#34; &#34;Coming Home&#34; &#34;Planets&#34; (the creepiest of them all) and &#34;Acid Rain&#34; as each has a very distinct sound and brings the album together. However, my favorite song is by far &#34;Heretic&#34; as it does have the most Avenged Sevenfold feel to it and some of the best guitar playing on the album.

B00DNDR29I|3.0|Very creative album but none of the songs really grabbed me like an Erykah Badu CD would. It was refreshing to hear real instruments and strings for a change instead of computer generated. I think she's under pressure from Bad Boy to sound commercial and Diddy has his hands in the creative process too much. I think as an artist she's too big for Bad Boy an needs to go to another label for more autonomy and creative control
1476733953|5.0|Wool is a must-read!!! It's immediately engaging and keeps you pulled in far beyond the end! I have read this book twice now and keep a copy on the shelf for my students!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Difficult game to walk away from. Great way to pass the time and to help you unwind after a stressful day.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is good I wonder what temple run 3 will be like. You should give an shoutout to the man/women who made this app
B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|I liked it because I like the Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter and those types of films.  What can I say?  I haven't grown up yet maybe...
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game keeps you on your toes...kid and adult friendly. My sister got me hooked on it. Love the beach area it's my favorite place...the minions are hilarious
B00ESY77LO|1.0|Having seen the original with Mia Farrow and Robert Farrow, I just couldn't get into viewing this version.  I quit watching after 30 minutes.  But, after seeing what to expect I might revisit it sometime in the future.
B0000062FL|5.0|Almost every song holds up as something you could put on the radio today, and be as modern, as hip, as enjoyable as anything else out there.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|So happy with this purchase.  Love all the songs she sings, especially 2 with Donnie Osmond.  They make a great pair singing together.  Their voices blend together so beautifully and no one is trying to &#34;hog&#34; the spotlight.  Wonderfully done CD and I would definitely buy again.
B0001CCY7E|5.0|This movie score is full of musical grandeur!  The music weaves through this wondrous story like a fine tapestry.  I only wish I'd bought it sooner!  John Barry is my favorite movie composer!
0316247545|5.0|This is a great little book.  Not little in content, only in size.  It covers everything and every episode of &#34;My Little Pony&#34; with extras included.  Couldn't have asked for more.  Highly recommend.
B000002O4X|5.0|I absolutely love this music.  John Barry is an incredibly gifted movie composer and in fact he is by far my favorite movie composer... having also done Dances with Wolves and Somewhere in Time.  His movie scores are always hauntedly beautiful music that makes your senses soar!
B003VA3JUO|4.0|\\"Ghost Ship is Surprisingly Good\\". So wrote the lead reviewer ten years ago. That is exactly what I was prepared to say. The movie has all the makings of a routine secondary (B) movie, but somehow the cumulative effect is to make it a satisfying experience. Its the usual knockabout crew of a salvage tug, behaviorally looking and acting like guys (and one girl) you would expect to find in a second rate movie. The action, when described, sounds pretty much like that in hundreds of such films. Yet it kept me watching and when it was over, I thought to myself: pretty good, glad I overcame my initial impulse to eject the disc and watch something else in the prime time period after dinner. If you are persuaded by reviewers to buy in order to watch, be sure to look for it in one of the collections that keep coming out.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Nice easy read, grabbed me quite quickly, once in the story, was very thought provoking, and brought tears to my eyes.
B008EKMB82|5.0|reading this book the storyline and characters in the book kept me interested and motivated which in turn kept me turning the pages.  I really didn't want this book to end!  Very well written and thought out!  You'll understand what I mean by &#34;thought out &#34; when you read this book.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I acually saw this movie first and really enjoyed it. I am a women and I was not that into seeing star trek my husband insisted though and I am glad he did. I really loved this movie enough that we bought it. I then watched the first one and it made this movie even better. Once I understood the relationships it made the story even more interesting and complete.
B002NXZY8K|5.0|This is just an awesome movie I can watch over and over... A little bit long, but definitely a great show...
B00B2JSRAS|3.0|When I tried the 1st exercise,  I did it with all my heart.  IT DIDN'T WORK<br />Anyone else?  I'd like to know.
B00DQVSTCG|2.0|Great show but the DVD sounds like something went wrong when mixing the audio of it.....This DVD could had been great but  I don't know if is because Amazon created this DVD ,because I have seen plenty of good reviews here for both the CD and the blue ray ,but my CD and my blue ray's audio quality is bad is like someone sat at the concert and recorded it with a cell phone is like the voice is not well blended into the music almost like the music needs to be higher...I'm very disappointed her previous concert CDs and DVDs/Blue Rays sound are of great quality but not this one....I will be contacting Amazon for a replacement immediately to see if I just got bad copies.
B00BEIYMAG|3.0|If you've seen the various trailers, you probably don't need to see the movie.<br /><br />It was hyped up far too much, so by the time I went to watch it, I was expecting \\"the best horror film\\" I have ever seen, and it just wasn't. It was a love child of The Exorcist and Paranormal Activity, where you aren't exactly scared as much as you are startled when objects (or people) jump out at you with a quick, loud noise. But, the premise is the same. From the setting to the ghostly encounters.<br /><br />I watched this movie alone and was able to go to bed right after, without a \\"buffer\\" that I sometimes need for other films.
B00E3D7WGU|2.0|Great show but the CD sounds like something went wrong when mixing the audio of it.....This CD could had been great but  I don't know if is because Amazon created this CD ,because I have seen plenty of good reviews here but my CD and my blue ray audio quality is bad is like someone sat at the concert and recorded it with a cell phone is like the voice is not well blended into the music almost like the music needs to be higher...I'm very disappointed her previous concert CDs and DVDs/Blue Rays sound are of great quality but not this one....I will be contacting Amazon for a replacement immediately to see if I just got bad copies.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|This was a good book to read. It was very suspenseful a must read for people who like suspense. 4 stars
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|This game challenged the Angry Birds status quo in an unexpected fashion. Without ruining the game, I will say that birds aren't the only slingshot using creatures. Now the pigs want some fun. The idea of replacing fired units with another is an ingenious power and the ability to use an infinite amount of units (one per level try) without having to buy more is a very smart addition. However, I would like to be able to create my own levels, including what side and what units are used for the level. If they add this custom level feature, then they will increase popularity and sales. Just my opinion, but many share it.
B00571F26Y|4.0|I am grateful to have read such a dynamic book, that has truly opened my eyes to the plight of modern day wheat and  its incompatibility to our wonderfully made bodies! #Wow
B00F91SCXC|1.0|Brad Pitt in the worse film of the century aside from Ishmael?  Really?  Absolutely sucks.  I wasted my money so You Would Not.  Amazon sucks for carrying it.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I am very happy with it. I found it to be exactly as described and it is very durable. I love it
B00BVYKWJI|5.0|&#34;The Borgias&#34; is not a show for people who prefer their Pope be clean and chaste - Alexander the Sixth was nowhere near either.  Those who recognize the human frailness of the Vatican during this period in history, however, should enjoy the lush steaminess of this production.  Jeremy Irons leads a terrific cast, the costumes and settings are stunning and the production values are very high indeed.  Definitely worth checking out!
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|Finally! A movie that is different and entertaining. Loved it even though Tom Cruise is in it. I loved it
B003G4W49C|4.0|Ender's game is an incredibly thought provoking book that teaches something to those of all ages.  While following Ender through his evolution as he is manipulated and grows to be his own person it is impossible to not connect with him on some level.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Second season does not disappoint! Not as eerie or scary as season 1. Where it lacks in horror it more than compensates with twisted and disturbing content!
B000S1M9LY|5.0|Despite -or perhaps because of- its marathon length, Infinite Jest is a unique take into what it means, and what it takes, to be happy, addicted, obsessed, wronged, anxious, suicidal. It is as unique in its analysis of the individual as it is in its social comment. Don't waste any more of your finite time reading reviews. Go read it.
B00632HWOG|1.0|Good thing this was free. It doesn't work in Brazil, where I live. I have to use the yahoo site itself  to  check my email on my kindle. When I try to log on, it asks me to type the machine code, then it requests an answer to my secret question, then it tells me my account has been unblocked and I can log in, but then it starts all over again with the code, question, etc. I  went  through all this about  a dozen times and gave up. Now I need to find out  how to remove it from my kindle, as it just gets in the way.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|Find this game difficult to use.  Poor instructions!  Have tried multiple times to play and can not figure out what I am doing wrong.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|You can have a great time playing this game is pretty great and it works perfectly download it is much better than lots of games
0345803485|5.0|A great book.Book one and three are the best,but you have to read book two to see what happens next.
B00AEBB8PQ|5.0|This is a great movie that was over looked. The characters were well thought and the casting worked well.  I would highly recommend it if you like sci-fi or just like eclectic films.
0345803493|5.0|Quite a good book to read.A book for everyone who is married and beyond.Books one and three are the best.
B004Q9T4E4|2.0|While I don't have the training and knowledge of history to rigorously challenge the author, I found his version of history limited. I'm sure there are other views with more emphasis on the achievements, past and future of states other than Europe and USA. He completely misses the threats that our current societies pose to the ecosystems that sustain us, and whether the West or the Rest or both are living such an environmentally destructive life, the planet is at risk. The West and the Rest will all go down together unless we develop a more thoughtful society.
B008JFUNYG|5.0|Mr son bought this movie.He has already seen it, but wanted a spare at home.It is not a movie for me, but he likes it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I'm not a reader but I couldn't put this book down. I loved it and plan on reading the others in this series.
0307740919|5.0|From the first page the story unfolds and holds you fast until the end.  Home is more than just a place to live and the author helps you feel that in your core.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so awesome but they should have the characters be a little less money but it is shop fun and awesome finally they came out  with the 2nt one
B006LSZECO|5.0|More that I expected at just the right price!  I would order from this seller again.  I am a satisfied customer.  This will be a book club selection.
B00E0G5U4G|5.0|I've had the cd for 3 days now and I can't stop playing it over and over. SS is amazing, the whole album flows perfectly. Not one bad song on the cd either. you will not stop banging your head to this. To me SS is an accumulation of all the old Carcass albums with great production. Sneap did a great job on the mix, the music sounds heavy yet expansive and clear. I will know order the vinyl version of this. Get this cd you will not be dissapointed like new new Morbid Angel.
B00F8GYC1Y|4.0|I have not played angry birds in years, but my seven and four year old think that this game is awesome.  I did have trouble downloading it, it would not show up on either of my kindles (original and the HD one) no matter how many times I synced it.  I had to go to the app store on my kindle and “re-buy” it.  It did not charge me to buy it again, when I pressed the buy button the install button immediately came up and I was able to download it then.
B003V1WXKU|5.0|Wish I would have read this when I was in high school, the man is brilliant. Tinkering with everything from an early age.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|Cute show really catches your attention and has fabulous character development. Emotionally wrenching with happy and sad scenes. My rating 5 star!
B004INNRFK|5.0|We keep listening to the CD over and over. The DVD is absolutely fantastic!!!<br />You won't be sorry if you buy this.  David Foster's other &#34;Hitman&#34; is wonderful<br />too.  Love, love, love them both!
B00F35B8F8|4.0|Loved the film saw it in the theater. Getting the triple format package is lovely. Seller's promises were kept. Thank you - would buy again.
B0087EVHVW|5.0|Excellent product well combined with good memories and practically flies motherboard, bring very good heatsink to keep the CPU running cool. I recommend it 100%
B00C6BB2JE|4.0|This is a movie that doesn't have to be taken too seriously. Sthepen Sommers had said a lot of times that he is a fan of Universal Monsters Movies, in this case Dracula, The Wolfman and Frankenstein, and he gives a decent tribute with a story that achieves the simple purpose of entertaining.<br />The video quality is great, what you expect from a Bluray and the audio is awesome.<br />Also, I had to say that this release in particular is really really good, the cover art of the steelbok is awesome!!! It looks like someone draw it instead of beign a photoshoped artwork.<br />The special features are ok, they aren't in HD...that's a shame.<br />I really like this movie and Kate Beckinsale...OMG!!! Enough said...
B0084TWN9K|5.0|Beautiful stories with believable characters and captivating story lines. Really difficult to put down once you start. Alice Munro never disappoints.
B00785P2QC|4.0|One of the funnest strategy games I have played in a long time. I do wish that all the goals were related to the game instead of goals related to social network sites.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|Omg only 15-? minutes!You have to be kidding  it is not worth ya'll's time don't get this game! NO ONE GET THIS GAME!
B00881VLCE|3.0|The puzzles have great graphics. However., there are a lot of glitches in the app. It freezes and undoes all your progress or it stops all together. I do love the fact that I can build puzzles on the go.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|This is the best version of Emma I have seen.  The actors were well chosen and the actress who plays Emma is especially exceptional and delightful.
B00DHRLK84|2.0|I ordered the bluray 3D unrated version. But I am annoyed that the 3D version is the theatrical version. I only ordered it to get the unrated in 3D.
B00BWJARHO|1.0|I have paid premium prices for higher Internet speeds just to be slowed down by Amazon's network. Was wanting to abandon Netflix after 10 years due to Amazon's better selection and ability to rent titles. But will have to keep paying to Netflix until Amazon fixes the issues. Very disappointed, especially since knowing Netflix uses Amazon servers.

B00F56AZK4|4.0|A lovely puzzle app with a good selection of pictures reasonably priced. The unique shapes make the puzzle fun. My requests would be for an option to turn the music off (any music gets tiresome after the tenth puzzle or so) and one to separate the edge pieces. A perk only possible with e puzzles that I have grown to quite like. Absent the music option I'd say a five star is a good fit.

B00992CF6W|5.0|I Love the game but they should update it and put The End in.If u want to have the end in the app say this was helpful!

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great, fun app. One reason I like, no love this app is because you don't constantly have to move your device around, like on Temple Run. Although for new users, if you get stuck on one townn, don't get frustrated, you have to update the game every couple months (update can be found in the app store) I recommend this app for all ages!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft . My brother got me in to it .my favorite mob is the creeper . My name is Balee by the way . See you later bye
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|I've love this game it is so fun if you like battling people online this is your game you can pick warriors guardians and mages
B009LDD54K|5.0|I liked the nice, tight way all the disparate story lines and characters are intertwined.  The acting is excellent all around.  I continue to be amazed at the superlative production values. For example, the sets and the costumes, almost like it was filmed in the 1920s.  The cars all look a bit too clean and shiny for the time and place, but I'm certain their modern owners wound never stand for any distressing of such a valuable and irreplaceable relic.  I was disappointed that Eddie was left wounded on a table with an uncertain prognosis and nothing more was said about his fate. Does he recover and return in Season 4?  He deserves more recognition than he's gotten until now.  In spite of being a rather mousy and long-suffering background character, he is actually a very brave man. Something I never did quite figure out is why Nucky shot the smart Aleck kid he holes up with in the basement of the booze stash house.  Was it  simply because the kid was an obnoxious punk who was too smart for his own good?  With so many principal characters either dead or out of the picture, how will Nucky go about reclaiming his position as the power broker of Atlantic City?  Can't wait for Season 4.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's so fun you should get this app you will love it to.There are different places were you could run and you could change your person.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|The author's skill with details results in the reader's travel into the story! An achievement that leaves you ready for the next chapter...and the next...
B00ANAC32U|1.0|I initially really liked this bumper, but after just a few weeks of use, the metal ring that holds the bumper together broke right around the USB port.  There's just a very thin piece of metal there, I believe it is the products week spot.  I wouldn't bother trying another one, I'm guessing they will all break at that point eventually.
B00CNIDH7A|5.0|Proving that \\"Save Me San Francisco\\" was no fluke, Train roll on with their career's second act with \\"California 37.\\" They've matured into a first class pop band, wielding hooks alongside an often bizarre sense of humor. Kind of like Maroon 5, but without the teen-idol thing going on. They're even smart enough to self-reference their surprising comeback on the opening song by giving lead singer Pat Monahan the opportunity to give both a history of his life and the evolution of Train in under four minutes, but to thank the band's fans and then do it all without the least bit of irony. \\"This'll Be My Year\\" alone would put the album at 4 stars just for compositional value alone.<br /><br />However, \\"California 37\\" has plenty of other charms. There's the twisted \\"50 Ways to Say Goodbye,\\" in which Monahan cuts down an ex-lover by singing \\"How could you leave me on Yom Kippur?\\" The mariachi inspired horns on \\"Drive By\\" (a great single, by the way), lift that song into a fun and unusual direction, and the title track again turns to Train's fans and thanks them for being there when the band wasn't in the spotlight.<br /><br />Relationships are also put to the test, song-wise, including \\"You Can Finally Meet My Mom,\\" song as a plaintive love song with a straight face. Country singer Ashley Monroe sings along in a duet about old flames getting back together in \\"Bruises,\\" made ironic by the fact that both parties are coming down from bad relationships. Train keeps making these very standard sounding pop songs that have crispy tops that the temptation to say \\"Highway 37\\" as perfect is awfully close, so I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt. At the very least it's a 4.5 just on the unconventionality of the lyrics and the fact that I've been listening to it for over a year without getting tired of it.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Hi.  I'm Dory.  I love this app!  I'm a huge Nemo fan!  This app is fun and relaxing and relieves my stress!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|What a captivating story.  I could not put it down.  It was my book club book and all 7 of us agreed.  It  brought up many topics for discussion.  Funny at times and sad at others.  Worth your time.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Loving this game! Find myself playing over and over again, and the ads are easy to dismiss and not annoying. So far the most played game on my kindle, nice to take a break from reading and play a few games :) again it's addictive!
B00FAJI116|5.0|This series is terrific in every way - believable, complex characters, great plot, beautiful setting.  Seriously good entertainment! You will be on the edge of your seat, guaranteed.  I don't know why American TV can't be like this - a cop show, a murder mystery, with no gore, no T&A, no bad language, virtually no weapons, yet utterly engrossing.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|My neice and nephew asked to download this one on my Kindle. When their mom arrived, they begged her to put it on her pc. It's a great strategy game, and encourages independant thinking.
B00336C3EY|4.0|This is not for you if you want a no brainer on a Friday night. It's a story that focuses on the crap that life deals us and how we cope with that. Of course, as with all Coen films its darkly funny too. Enjoy
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|my kids love this game!!!!  updates were fast and added more levels!!!!!  works great and I even enjoy playing it with my kids
B000W94FE6|5.0|I obtained many insights into our human psychology to better understand what makes us have that feeling and sense of Optimal Experience which can be also called happiness/flow
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I loved the book and the movie, so happy I was able to get it on my Kindle.  Thanks for making this availlable,
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love it! It really makes your brain work... unfortunately there are only ten levels... just waiting to see what's next.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|The epilogue wasn't all I hoped and dreamed about, but I have a feeling any way this series ended wouldn't have satisfied me as much as just continuing to write more books would have ;)  I LOVE WoT!!!<br /><br />This one was a page turner... so fun!  Absolutely epic!
B00ESNDOF8|5.0|The characters are very interesting.From Cary Agos,The Florricks,Will Gardner,Khalinda Sharma,Diane Lockhart etc etc, are fun to watch.These characters make this Drama look real to me.
B009HUB40Y|1.0|Deleted before even opening due to getting a warning from Lookout Security that it was adware. There are plenty of apps out there without dealing with ads.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Never be caught without a book for company.  These guys have it set so you are in sinc with all your toys...start with the Kindle, end with the iPad and do the middle with your phone...

1575666286|5.0|It healed my Eczema of 5 years! I have discovered the miracle of healthy living. Thank you! I have adopted this way of eatin for life.
1439507775|5.0|Bought this wonderful book for a keepsake and picked this edition specifically because it's labeled as 'illustrated by Mel Grant.&#34;  However, don't be fooled: there is not a single illustration inside, not one.  The cover is nice, but doesn't an illustrated book generally come with illustrations?  Disappointing to say the least.  The novel itself is timeless and very beautifully written, but don't buy this particular edition.
B007MU85D0|5.0|I usually listen to maybe a few songs of an album and I can't remember the last time I enjoyed one in its entirety. But this is different. I love this album, I listen to it constantly and strangely enough I'm not sick of yet! If you love awesome music, buy this!
B0045HCJ9E|5.0|This is one of my favorite Hitchcock movies!  I love intense, suspenseful movies that also have humor throughout.  Great movie!
B00BMUVW5O|5.0|Easy reading and proof that cats are smarter than we think! I highly recommend this book. It is suitable for all ages.
B00E5Q1LTY|4.0|Star Trek Into Darkness brought back one of our favorite characters. We really enjoyed the action and the twist on the original movie.
B007WZ55XI|4.0|I like the way this book gives the mathematical relations in obtaining parameters such as normalised power and some justification for them. Unfortunately it is not always consistent in its use of symbols.
B004J09ONG|5.0|This was my favorite movie as a kid, and I still have the \\"soundtrack\\", which is really most of the movie recorded on the album.  I used to listen to that all the time.<br /><br />Finally showed it to my family.<br /><br />Born free and life is worth living, but only worth living, 'cause you're born free!<br />True for us humans too!
B00821OX98|5.0|my wife and kids just want to keep watching the show all day. we'll watch it all day sat sun
1600597963|5.0|The pictures are eye candy, and the instructions are thorough and comprehensive. I would recommend it to anyone who likes beading.
B00E8B1358|3.0|This GI Joe movie was okay, a little better then the first one, but not by much.  I actually didn't like how a lot of the other Joes just died.  I think I'd much rather have had a reboot of the franchise of the movies.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|The book is about a boy's journey towards finding his treasure. The author unfolds his story as one would pull down a rose flower...petal by petal and as you read on, the reader, together with the boy discover the authors perspective of life, fate and destiny and the hand that controls all things.<br /><br />The suspense is exhilarating...once the reading begins, it will be hard to close the book.
B004X4R49Y|5.0|King goerge is now my favorite King, I was so inspired by his life I hope his new grandson is as marvelous.
1442346949|3.0|I do love Apple, however, among biographies, this is overwhelmingly written as nothing more than another Apple fan product, from end to end. Doubtful it will stand the test of time for others.
B005LAII8A|5.0|First of all, the condition of the DVD was excellent, and arrived in a timely manner.<br /><br />Secondly, the movie itself was excellent!  The relationship between the main character and his future self is well done.  The existence of time travel is an established fact, and as such, is appropriately not dwelt upon.  The character development is excellent, and you find yourself rooting for both of the main characters, even when they are at cross-purposes with each other.<br /><br />This movie is definately a 119 minutes well spent!
B002QBS9KE|2.0|well the foam fits but the ear pieces were too  big to fit in my old voyager 510. was taking a gamble if they fit, pleased the foam does fit over my old ear piece.
B009UNH0EM|5.0|Plantronics created a unique connector for their Voyager Legend Bluetooth Headset, and you always need spares, right? This is a great value!
B000FBJAEG|5.0|It started a bit slow...but it doesn't take long before it picks up and you can't put it down! A great read...
B00BGI076M|1.0|The only reason I've been watching this since episode 1 is in some blind hope of a miraculous recovery. Unfortunately there's no sign of it, every episode is as bad as the previous ones, or even worse. Finally I'm giving up.<br /><br />Shockingly superficial developments, lack of the slightest resemblance of rationality and unbelievable/unrelatable characters, no patience with the writing. It seems more like theatre than TV, everything is exaggerated to a point of hilarity. No subtlety, it's all very quickly done with little appreciation of human nature. Tries to live off its shock value, both in the gratuitous violence and the ridiculously simplistic unrealistic developments and characters.<br /><br />To me the acting is also poor, especially of the followers, they are so theatrical, doesn't suit motion picture. Kevin Bacon is also unimpressive but there's not much he could have done with the lousy script. It's all very lifeless.<br /><br />Very disappointing, spend your time watching some insightful documentaries instead.<br /><br />I'd feel guilty giving it 1 out of 10, after all I did struggle through a few episodes. So I give it 3, cos I'm having a good day.
0307341577|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It's not for anyone looking for a feel good novel. I was guessing until the end and was blindsided. Flynn is an author with a flavor all of her own.
B00DWZHTRW|2.0|Showmen have no soul. This is a typical show-boating movie that has only one purpose: to look cool. The easiest way to do that is to turn the characters into some infallible \\"winners\\" who are always in control of everything. To me, all that control is seriously boring rather than cool. I like to see movies where the characters face challenges, have doubts, are faced with tough situations and sometimes fail. That feels real. This one felt like some perfume commercial where they're trying to sell you a cool image, rather than a product. It never had any soul.<br /><br />I'm not even that concerned about plotholes and poor dialogue.<br /><br />I think it may appeal to some teenagers or people who are into \\"reality\\" TV and celebrity culture.
B00B8BR1YS|5.0|This offering is among the best movies ever made.  This will be rated with the classics and has to be one of the 10 best..

B00AECGQF2|5.0|Awesome app ME and my best friend loves it when downloaded it , it was free and now it's 2,99
B00AFROVQC|3.0|...it was enough to keep me interested. I believe the story has potential. It's just that after reading R. R. Martin, Jordan and other epic fantasy sagas, the writing seems more childish, or at least, more basic, than what I am now used to. I will be getting the next one though, because my curiosity is slightly piqued.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Takes a while for stuff to load but other than that great game wish it was easier to get land tho
B00A8ECU24|5.0|dear 1 star reviwers. Have you ever thought why your game crashes? Do you have a lot of apps? Is your pony village full of stuff? Then that's probably why your game crashes. And if I liked this game? I loved it! It's always having you play the game instead of waitting for ever because your crops or houses ect. This game however you wait about 1- 3 minutes for something to get done!
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|This is probably the best movie ever! I recomend this movie to everybody over 8. Best movie ever! Please watch!
B00846REIS|5.0|This is the first Sylvia Day book that I have read, and I must say I was pleasantly surprised! The book was well written, the characters continued to grow and develop throughout the book. Her description of the characters really put a mental picture of them in my mind. I've read the 50 Shades trilogy and loved it. I would not compare this story to that one. The reviewers that thought that this author was trying to copy E.L.James, should have read this with more of an open mind. Both stories are excellent in their own right. I can't wait to continue this trilogy!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Good thing to use for homework or words you need for any day use. Kids love it very much, as do i
B0063M22QO|5.0|I like the pretty tiles and progressively difficult boards. This game is a good way to put in some time while keeping my brain alert and challenged.
B0059XTUVI|1.0|I was expecting to see a movie about Margaret Thatcher's life, particularly her political life.  What I saw was a representation of an older Margaret having health issues with flashback's of her political career and hallucinations she supposedly had.  What a bore.  I did not feel that it was appropriate to try to represent Mrs. Thatcher's deteriorating health status.  While I do think Glenn did an excellent job of acting, the movie itself was very disappointing and in poor taste.  I really can't recommend this movie at all.  Instead, try a documentary if you want to know about Mrs. Thatcher. It will likely be more worth your time.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Every married couple should read this book!  It should be required to get a marriage license! Would prevent many divorces for sure.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|We are using this for our tv in the bedroom as it is not a smart tv.  We use it for Netflix and it works great!
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Oh bloody hell. The 3d on this thing is amazing, it's a absolute must see in 3d. The movie is great but in 3d? WOW!!
B004HYDL1K|4.0|A typical Rodriguez movie - over the top in some ways. Lots of big names and a sympathetic hero even if he is a killer - he only kills the bad guys. The first part of the movie is fairly slow but the intensity increases quickly. Trejo plays the part to perfection and the normal batch of Rodriguez folks are there - Cheech, etc. Recommended.
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|Great, diverse characters. Excellent acting and direction. Witty, short dialogues. Smart, entertaining plots. Well above the rest. Each episode leaves me wanting for more!
B00164GDA0|4.0|Stand by Me is one of the best Stephen King movies ever made. It features a cast of teenagers who go on an adventure and must deal with the hardships of growing up.

B00CO8D3G4|5.0|There aren't a lot of books out there that simultaneously cut through the bullsh*t we're fed hourly AND that give you extremely practical and relevant advice, so the fact that this even exists is a proof that the walls are coming down slowly of &#34; the American Dream.&#34; This book is worth three times the price alone just for its first two chapters. Definitely check this out!

B004J09ONG|5.0|This written by my five year old daughter:  It's a great movie.  It's about a lion who lived with people who loved the lion very much.  When the lion grew up they couldn't keep it anymore so then they let it go. The lion liked living in the wild, and the people were very proud of their lion.  We very much enjoyed it. I hope you will, too.
B000WQWPJQ|3.0|Cast Away stars Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt. Hanks crash lands on a deserted island and must find a way to survive. The picture and audio quality are superb. The real problem is that Fox removed all of the documentary materials from the two-disc DVD edition (we only get an audio commentary and a trailer). This is a 4 star film in a 3 star package.<br /><br />Video Resolution/Codec: 1080p/AVC MPEG-4   Aspect Ratio: 1.85:1<br />Audio Formats: English DTS-HD Lossless Master Audio 5.1 Surround (48kHz/24-bit), French Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround (640kbps), Spanish Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround (640kbps)<br />Subtitles/Captions: English SDH, French Subtitles, Spanish Subtitles<br />Special Features: Audio Commentary, Theatrical Trailer
B00CP2Z5TC|3.0|i really like two of their other CDs, but this one was not as peppy, fun, and original. A bit disappointed, although it's still creative
B009AMALLM|3.0|The latest installment in the Paranormal Activity horror franchise is now available on Blu-ray in this 2-disc set. Both the 87-minute theatrical cut and the 96-minute unrated version are included. While it isn't as good as the previous movies, fans will appreciate this sequel. The box office is starting to slip for the franchise but it is still wildly profitable with a new film to be released in theaters every year. I would recommend renting 4 unless you are a huge fan of the films. Amazon reviewers rate this a lowly 2.8 stars. The picture quality is average but the audio is fairly good on the Blu-ray. There is only 29 minutes of total bonus content.<br /><br />Video Resolution/Codec: 1080p/AVC MPEG-4   Aspect Ratio: 1.78:1<br />Audio Formats: English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, French Dolby Digital 5.1, Spanish Dolby Digital 5.1, Portuguese Dolby Digital 5.1<br />Subtitles/Captions: English SDH, French, Spanish, Portuguese<br />Special Features: Deleted Scenes, DVD Copy, UltraViolet Digital Copy
B00006RAKP|5.0|A great collection of Elton John's greatest. From some of his older songs all the way to his more modern.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Sometimes we are the ones who learn from another whom we are trying to help. They help us unknowingly. A unexpected story of unselfish love.
B00AWJMTXK|4.0|This always makes me giggle,nothing seriouse whatsoever and the stories are not even remotely about people like my friends and community.  I think that's why it makes me laugh.  I don't have to analyze anything or try to understand hidden meanings...
B00BWJARHO|4.0|Interesting adventure, full of typical ego and tribal prejudices. Can be a fun watch if you just enjoy the CGI stuff and forget the politics.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app is great to access your pinterest account when on the road. Love it! Totally recommend it for those who have pinterest
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I am re-reading these books for the third time. It's like reading them for the first time all over again! I love them!
B003H9MSPG|4.0|The gun makes you look really cool running around with it, but it fails to shoot teh advertised distance. This would be fine if it had a large enough clip to work like the other short ranged guns, but it does not. The reload system, while again looks cool, does not allow for fast rapid fire. If your getyting this gun as a gift or just to play around with in a short distance, its great. However, if your getting this for any kinds of HVZ game, nerf Warz, or other more competative game, I would advise against it.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|If you are an employer, parent, student or anyone who deals with a variety of people, please watch!  It is a good reminder of how we all see the world differently and how one brave woman is accepting what we might consider a disability and giving the world a new care of animals.  A close friend watch it and said &#34; doesn't everyone see the world as Temple?  &#34;. And now dealing their own social disability.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|There isn't any Lee Child aka Jack Reacher book that isn't 5 stars.  They are addictive.  I promise.  They are all wonderful.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|This is one you will watch over and over if you are a music lover.<br />The music in this is better than its original counterpart.<br />This movie has you watching movies and listening to music you never were interested in before.<br /><br />A young standoffish girl goes to college only to please her father with out intending to really participate.<br />Her dad pushes her to get involved and she finds that she actually can (slowly and painfully) like being around people.<br /><br />There are just no words to express how awesome this movie is.<br />YOU HAVE JUST GOT TO SEE IT FOR YOURSELF.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This app is so cool i just can't stop playing it!!! And they have a Gameloft app on there so you can talk to people and compete against them!! So fun!!! Get it is it so worth it!!! &lt;3
B0090SI4OC|5.0|Earth is a utopian society but at the cost of losing themselves to a (peaceful) alien race who innocently believe it is their job to improve worlds they infiltrate.<br />But still self seeking as it is the only way to perpetuate their species.<br /><br />Similar to Twilight in the love story, the young girl is taken over by the alien but her strong will fights it and finds her way back to her lover. But things get complicated as he cant accept her as she is and one of the other survivors falls in love with the alien counterpart within her.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I so truly enjoyed Downton Abbey! This is not normally a show I would watch but it was recommended to me by a co-worker. Their words were be careful you will get hooked and they were right!  I love the fact that this show equally focuses on the servants and the upper class family. They are likeable characters and even the ones you don't care for you warm up to them. Wonderful! Can't wait for Season 4!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game because it is so much fun! I think this is a wonderful game because it is destructive!
B001PO53IO|5.0|Awesome i couldnt stand miself. I was going crazy. I was being turned on by this season. It was nice.
0316019984|5.0|Amazing detail and amount of pop-ups. My 4-year-old nephew AND my 40-year-old husband both were fascinated by it. Younger children will likely need help turning pages to make sure pop-ups don't get bent, but this is still a great gift for kids. And there's lots of info to read for adults too.
B0031RS4UM|4.0|Must admit, enjoyed Killing Floor more, but that is not to say, i didn't enjoy this.<br />Couldn't put either book down.
030759565X|4.0|Love this product. Love that is has some vegetarian recipes. I am not vegetarian, but I do appreciate a vegetarian dish here and there. Also great for when cooking for vegetarian guests.  Some recipes are vague in the instructions and you do have to flip between pages to get ingredients and instructions, Overall I think this cookbook is great with delicious easy recipes and great photos of the dishes.
B0031RS2HC|5.0|I loved it, Best to start at the very beginning of the Series.<br />You find out who, and how Jack became Jack, or is it Reacher!
B001EBV0OY|4.0|Such a good story, except there's no con alive who would take new evidence to the warden as Andy did - he would first call his family (if he were able) and then he would have contacted his defense attorney to get back in front of a judge for a new trial. I don't care how good of &#34;buddies&#34; a con may be with the administration/guards, there is no trust of this magnitude between them. And since Stephen King didn't develop trust between Andy and the Warden, this story line make NO sense.<br /><br />And since Shawshank Prison is supposed to be in Maine - WHERE'S THE SNOW? My sister-in-law if from upstate Maine and they have snow eight to nine months per year. At least there should have been some on the ground.<br /><br />It was such a good story to ruin by such sloppy development. This just goes to show how stupid Hollywood and the entertainment industry thinks the general public is. It's an insult.<br /><br />Good packaging, reasonable shipping.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|This dictionary has a lot of stuff and information about definitions for words and maps.So that's why I use it.
0316381357|4.0|Made me think. Nice story, I agree about how difficult life's choices can be sometimes, as well as the consequences. Good packaging, reasonable shipping.
B00005YJMX|4.0|I own the 2 disc DVD, and the transfer is less than impressive.  There are many scenes with heavy grain, and some that seem out of focus (or soft focus).  This is from watching it on a 46\\" plasma with a Blu Ray player. Hopefully they will rerelease it on Blu Ray with a much better picture quality.  Anchor Bay's releases usually suffer from the same issues, unfortunately.
B008220BLG|5.0|Pleasantly surprised. So much fun. I'm not a zombie fan, but I loved this movie. It's an homage and parity all rolled into one. I had rented it, and I was inspired to buy it. The actors did a great job, and I love the soundtrack.  Two thumbs up!
B00DJYKFXG|3.0|Well.  The new mix is definitely different.  There are things that I like about it and things that I do not.  I don't think that it will replace the original mix for me.  Whether it gains a place side by side remains to be seen.<br /><br />What I like:  It recaptures that dull, wooden, thump kind of sound that characterized The Band's first two albums.  It also brings up and separates out the instrumental contributions , and especially, the vocals of The Band.  This aspect is really, really good.<br /><br />What I don't like:  The remixing of the horns.  The horns are mixed down so that they are much less prominent.  If that was the only way that the horns were remixed, that may or may not have been OK with me.  The problem is that the horns themselves have been so remixed that the power and majestic harmonies of the horns are gone.  At times the horns are almost absent.  Many of your favorite horn passages, if you like the horns, will be virtually unrecognizable.  Others will be completely inaudible.  The horns on the original LP version of Rag Mama Rag are one the highlights of the LP for me.  On this remixed version the horns are virtually unrecognizable.  Same with Across The Great Divide.
B00BVYKWJI|5.0|Awesome! The quality is really nice. Watched all of the episodes online. Can't wait for the next season. Hopeful that it will be soon!
B00D2PIUAM|5.0|I have been waiting for another album from them, and it didn't disappoint. \\"Too Many Friends\\", when I first heard it, was a bit short, but still catchy and sorta melancholy, but that's what I love about their music. I evolved from angry music in my twenties, to more mellow and introspective rock now, and this is my favorite band in that regard. I never got tired of their last one, and I definitely don't see myself getting tired of this one. Buy it!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This trilogy is impossible to put down--the storytelling is powerful and engrossing; the characters, and their relationships are vivid and compelling and their responses to the various vicissitudes they face in the dystopian world of Panem are realistic.
B004AKCME8|4.0|I enjoyed the artistry of the movie and the message. I don't know if it would be scary for little ones.
B00D2HTRVQ|5.0|My 3 yr old love  this app, can play for hours,  he really like the idea of fixing items, turning them on . He even enjoys the high 5, pretty neat thing , when u have accomplished your task. He learned very quickly how to run.
B00DG292SK|5.0|Peter Townshend has always been a hero of mine. He deserves his reputation as the most intelligent and articulate of the classic rockers. strangely enough, I wouldn't say I am a particular Who fan, but I've enjoyed and even played many of their songs. In the 80s, Townshend's solo work make a wonderful impression. I was never much for Roger Daltrey's voice, though Townshend's songs are undeniably brilliant so frequently that The Who is simply part of the musical fabric of my youth.<br /><br />As one would expect from a good rock bio, Townshend tells of his early life and education which includes joining up with some school friends and starting a band. He then tells the tails of writing songs, the stories and relationships behind them as well as the adventures and misadventures of the road.<br /><br />What makes this book stand out is Townshend's willingness to share his emotional life and the story of his spiritual development. Like the Stones, The Who has never really stopped completely. Despite years of work in the publishing industry, periods developing live theater and solo albums, The Who is always just a few phone calls away from a gig - there is never a break-up moment when all four members storm off and never speak again. Even with two members gone from this mortal coil, when Townshend and Daltrey perform, whether for charity or novelty, the are The Who.<br /><br />I listened to this one in the car over the better part of 2 weeks and I am glad I experienced the book that way. Townshend reads the book himself - laughs at himself, raises his voice in passion and lowers it in sadness. I love his singing and I love hearing him speak. He writes really well and brings together a thousand small stories into a cohesive, beautiful work which also happens to be his life.<br /><br />ROCK ON!!!!
B00DGKQF2S|5.0|Great musicianship as you would expect from these 3 guys. Songs range from rocking up tempo to some very bluesy & down tempo tracks. Not just a musician wank session although most rock musicians (as I am) can get off on the amazing licks, there is actually some great song writing & soulful vocals.
1476734941|5.0|This book is very helpful for dieting and really helped me and my wife. Looks like it would help diabetics.
B009FZFONO|1.0|I bought it thinking I could play it on my TV, only way to watch was on iPad or computer which sucked. Ended up having to re-buy the whole season elsewhere.
B00ACBN9CI|4.0|It's really not a bad game, for being totally free it's impressive.<br />Sometimes I feel like the controls just won't cooperate, but it doesn't do to much to detect from the experience.<br />If it was any better, I would feel bad not paying for it.
B0053O89K6|5.0|What is it this series has that almost everyone loves it?... House would say: &#34;Me&#34;. And he would be 100% right!!... Love this series, I have all the previous seasons and now I feel complete with this final season!!... 200% recommended!!
0345529057|3.0|Wont say a thing about Georges writing.<br />I understand this are paperback copies, yet they are really tiny and weak.<br />It is quite hard to read this without thinking that they are going to break before you reach the end.<br />Yet, this are cheap books, if you just want to read this to follow the TV series or if you just want it to pass it around without having to worry about losing expensive copies, then get them.<br />Is not collection material.<br /><br />There should be something in the middle between this and the super expensive box sets.
B00C6B9H46|5.0|What to say about this movie that haven't been said already?... If you don't own it yet, then grab this steelbook version right now and enjoy the movie!!... 100% recommended. Only for those who want to spend some time having fun and enjoying a sci-fi movie packed with some action and thriller...
B00ADQCBEY|1.0|Does Hollywood really expect Americans to accept this drivel for anything beginning to seem like real life police drama?<br /><br />Not really a bad concept, just bad execution.<br /><br />Speaking of execution, maybe there could be the death penalty at risk for TV executives who fill the U.S. airwaves with such pap.
B009ZQJ0ME|3.0|Interesting plot with good special effects.  A little hard to follow at times.  A movie that is worth seeing. Check it out
B000069AUH|5.0|They are their own sound, there is no one else like them. I really love owning vinyls, they are like a time capsule, and every time I use my record player it just feels right, like that is how I should use be listening to my music. To listen to A Rush of Blood to the Head, that just brings me back to when I first fell in love with Coldplay's sound. It was a good year for them and its a great album to own.
B006BFK5DK|3.0|Glad to see a new EWF release, but from an old school fan that has every US release since &#34;Last Days And Time&#34; in 1972.<br />The writing just isn't the same, but the musicians are great, and the vocals are good. Glad I have my old LP's....
B008YKGQR4|1.0|this would not let me get on face book on my kindle. it keeps saying there is an error. not liking that much
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Love this movie, beautiful story with beautiful art style. Miyazaki movies have never disapointed me.  Everyone should watch this movie.
B00EVCD9HY|5.0|This album is ridiculously good.  She is amazing on her own, but the collaborations...  extremely great picks!  Buy  this  album!
B009NFHF0Q|2.0|This book is fantasy but it is nota story that wrapped me up and pulled me into it's world. Rather it was a silly book full of make believe characters. I would not recommend and wish I had spent my time and miner somewhere else.
B002C4YYEU|3.0|I've read the short story as well, and I still don't understand the point. On the other hand, I enjoyed the New Orleans on location shots. I recognized many of the locations.
B007THA4FI|2.0|Sort of a soap opera type narrative.  Too many characters with too slow a direction.  Her latest book was very much liked.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Awesome tv series! This is not normally a show I would watch but I gave it a try and was hooked after the first episode. The characters and story just draw you in and you find yourself wanting to know what happens next!
B006MGB31Q|5.0|Bought this for my wife who loves the Alien movies. The bluray looks good and all movies work.<br />Two more words required.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this show.  I've wwatched all the seasos through streaming video, and it's great to watch a whole season at once.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is absolutely the best, it's fantastic, so easy to use and my bible is always with me.  thank you.
B005HS00NW|5.0|I bought this for sentimental reasons. Midnight City was in a movie my son watched over and over and I bought it because of him.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|A great way to give you energy . You will definetly enjoy this game full of fun and action and adventure. Download if and try it today !!!!
B008J34466|5.0|I've always liked Pink and this is by far her best album yet. I don't even have to skip over any songs when listening to it because I like them all.
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|For a Zombie, end of the world type, this was a good movie. The actors are very good and you get that cringe on the edge of your seat feeling that you're looking for if you're watching this type of movie.
B000VYX8PE|4.0|Love these books when I was younger they taught me so much about the poo poo outside world. Anything that can go wrong will go wrong in these books. Listen to the warnings it's not quite pleasant, but it is a pleasant read.
B00BXLU1EU|5.0|This is the most best game I have ever I had and I hope you'll get this game it's so cool
B008476HBM|5.0|I have read this novel several times and find myself turning the pages in a constant state of interested suspense.  It is a refreshing relationship novel rather than insipid romance and I<br />particularly enjoyed the  strong female roles and the exploration and exposure of both the foibles and strengths of all the characters in the novel.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|awesome movie ,want to watch again. The plot threw me for a loop . Morgan Freeman wa great in this movie.
B004BRQYJ4|5.0|One of the best soundtracks i've purchased. I love listening to the music during a workout. Great on a road trip.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I really enjoyed this game but wish it had lasted longer. I will try some o<br />f the other games by the same maker. I wish it didn't get you interested and then want you to pay.
B001NLL93W|5.0|I really enjoyed both this book and the first three in the series that I've read so far. Kept me very interested all the way through, I couldn't wait to finish and read the next one!
B005LAIII0|5.0|Beautifully (and amazingly !) done! The CGI in this film is impeccable. I originally saw it in the theater in 3-D, which was subtly but enriching. It is no less a pleasure to watch it again on my TV.
B008JFUO36|3.0|Visually the movie is lucious. I think the post apocalyptic genre is getting tired. I would have liked the movie a little more if a different actor was in the lead. Cruise is over exposed and needs to go away for a long time.
B0012GMW7A|5.0|I find him flat out amazing! He has  produced and performed memorable work for many years. I hope he continues for many years to come.
B004SKJTY6|5.0|A different way, see and listen all the video. Please don't let to see in meeting in family or if you want, with yours friends. Wonderful
B00AF6B22E|5.0|I have to admit, even knowing Denzel Washington, one of my favorite actors, was in this movie, I had my doubts about it.  In fact, the only reason I bought this movie was because it was on sale and I really liked the cast.  But man, Denzel's portrayal of an alcoholic pilot really knocked it out of the ballpark for me.  If you're looking for a movie with rock solid performances and heavy drama, you can't go wrong here.
0316228583|4.0|An intelligent piece of fiction.  I find the characters very believable and the writing very engaging.<br />I didn't read any of the Harry Potter, but am quite enjoying this!
B005LAIHY0|3.0|I'm not sure where to begin with this.  I thought the movie was just okay.  I was really hoping it would prove to be a divergence from the Alien movies but this was designed to fit into the Alien universe.  It would have been much stronger if they'd pay more attention to the script.  A lot of the characters actions were so stupid and unbelieveable.  The first two or three Alien movies had much stronger storylines and even if they pushed the outside of the credibility envelope, they didn't blow it open completely.  I thought the acting was great, but the actors can only do so much with a bad script and story.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|There are some really different of opinions in the reviews for this book.  I personally really liked it.  I loved the close ties the Jordan siblings have.  They have had their share of bad luck, the boys more so.  Megan suffered also, big time.  I liked Todd and Megan's story.  Iian I just loved.  He's such a sweetheart.  I plan on reading the whole series.  This is the first book I have read by this author.  I'm sure I will enjoy other books by her.  I recommend this book.
B003XWEQ1G|4.0|Although it's certainly a revised version of the Robin Hood tale, its quite entertaining.  Russell Crowe gives a good performance and I thought the movie was good.  It was reminiscent of movies like King Arthur which drew a completely different picture of that tale as well.  This version was gritty and dark to a certain extent.  Much different from the Kevin Costner version - which I also found enjoyable (hey, I like just about anything with Morgan Freeman) and oh so different from the Errol Flynn version.  I like each of those other versions also as the Robin Hood story is fascinating no matter which version you watch.  I would recommend this movie.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|the force is strong with this one<br /><br />is it better than the free one can not wait for up date so keep up with game data! does it have more worlds than free one I think the thrid<br /><br />world
B00CX7TOOG|5.0|I have seen enough good stories in my time. I find it enjoyable to just sit back and watch good performances and some good cinematography and listen a good score. KILLING SEASON has good acting and beautiful cinematography. I tell you, I enjoyed this one. The setting, the backdrop of the Appalachian mountains was essential to the motives of DiNero's character and essential to the larger picture of the story and all it implied. John Travolta as a former Serbian soldier gives a very good performance and he is convincing. The acting, the performances in this film reveal a lot and has something to say about those who have found themselves in harm's way.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. It teaches me to focus well, while at the same time it's improving my reflexes.
B00EMQI3UM|5.0|O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? is another Coen Brothers masterpiece. Upon seeing this film I thought I stepped into another era or time warp or something. What a curious film! George Clooney is very appealing and likeable in this little oddball film. It grows on you after you get used to its style and music. But that is exactly what Joel Coen and Ethan Coen have accomplished with their resume of cinematic storytelling.<br /><br />Joel Coen and Ethan Coen have really captured something here. I find their films fascinating. There is some amount of magic and unwritten sense of order in the world that Joel Coen and Ethan Coen have created in this film. I watch it often and am still mesmerized by their curious style.
B00DVKOYBM|3.0|The a regular computer is better then the touch screen you get a bounce 400 coins free. You don't get any power ups
B0002NRRAG|5.0|Her style of music is different, clear and precise sounds were recorded and the qaulity of this cd is very good.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I would defiantly recommend this. Graphics are great and no buffering. This way better than subway surfers. BUY, BUY,BUY.<br />BUY
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|The quality of the cd was perfect, great sounds and perfect packaging, couldn't wait to open the package to play her music.
B005DD7H50|5.0|Great movie we loved watching it,and I have seen it many times before,can't wait for the DVD I bought so I can watch it again!
B005SEYOXW|4.0|The Wild West meet Star Wars (minus the aliens) really sums up this series. The acting could be a bit better and the major downfall is there is only 14 episodes.
B000UX6THK|5.0|This product truly lives up to its name, it it the &#34;Definitive&#34; edition. Twin Peaks is a great show and this collection is a must own for fans of the show.
B0072HDP9M|5.0|I loved this book even more than the movie . The characters were real and the plot kept me interested from the beginning to the end
B00DDXJRJG|1.0|What you have here is a total ripoff.it is nothing but a fancy volume control knob.I feel taken.get the bass pro.it works good and costs less.avoid this thing.
B001ER4CSO|5.0|Love the inter action between the main characters...great action...very entertaining.  This is by far one of the best.<br />Recommend highly.
B00B9366VO|4.0|While at first seeming a touch Grohl-centric, Sound City quickly proves to be a love letter to music, musicianship, and rock. Dave Grohl has spent an incredible amount of time documenting a legendary studio, a unique technology, and the humanity (and human effort) that it takes to make lasting memories for all involved and for its consumers. This is a peek behind the curtain of some of the best of those memories and is a joy to watch.
B00A285OOW|5.0|This is in essence a continuation of the White Queen. I loved this novel and the author's interpretation of events.
B0015D3YX6|5.0|Updated for the Mobile Fidelity SACD:<br /><br />Mofi's release of &#34;Forever Changes&#34; captures the sound of the original release to perfection in this SACD. For those used to the sound of the previous mastering done by Bill Inglot, Dan Hersch and Andrew Sandoval for Rhino, this version sounds quite a bit different. The sound is t quite as bright and some might find this a bit veiled compared to previous masterings but that sound was intentional and represents the sound of the master recording. If you are looking for something that sounds like the Rhino, you will be disappointed but for those looking for an accurate representation of the mastertape and that resembles hoe the album should sound, you will be happily surprised. The mastering by Rob LeVerde is exceptional--but this really is all down to taste when it comes to the original album and what you want and expect to hear).<br /><br />As with all Mobile Fidelity releases sinc the label returned, this is in a gatefold cardboard sleeve. We don't get lyrics or any notes on the making of the album. Nevertheless, this is a handsome presentation of the album with the photo that, as I rexall, was on the back cover of the album when first released.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong--this doesn't exactly replace the Inglot/Hersch/Sandoval/Hoffman remaster of the two CD set but is a supplement to it.<br /><br />Original review for 2 CD deluxe: &#34;Forever Changes&#34; was ranked as one of the 100  greatest album of all time. It's deserved. While Love never achieved the large following of their label mates The Doors (The Doors were signed at their recommendation and were big admirers of Love's founder Arthur Lee), the group found critical acclaim, lasting influence on other musicians and found brief mainstream success. The band quickly progressed from a garage sound to a fascinating mixture of strings, horns with the elliptic songwriting of Lee.<br /><br />&#34;Forever Changes&#34; remains the band's masterpiece (which isn't to slight any of their other albums--the first four are essential flaws and all).

B00ARF92HK|2.0|Some action yes but movie too slow for me. Needs a better plot, actors, and director. Also not for kids, too bloody.
B003KRJNBW|5.0|Excellent movie. Denzel Washington is phenomenal in this role.  I will watch again. It is worth a watch even if you ate not a denzel fan.
0988262592|5.0|I had the good fortune to hear Gene speak about the book (and DevOps in general) at a Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery meetup in Washington, DC. The most obvious thing about this work that separates it from everything else on the topic is the very novel idea (pun very much intended) of literally telling a story, told from the perspective of a fictional (but very real) mid-level Ops Manager. Our intrepid Ops Manager is thrust into a position where he needs to find better ways for IT staff in his organization to do business, because the very survival of the organization depends on it. What is also innovative about this work is the notion of applying Goldratt's Lean Manufacturing principles (from his book The Goal) so that those principles are described and applied in a DevOps context. - Philip Rogers, Enterprise Agile Coach
B009K0P10K|5.0|I truly enjoyed these episodes and this season. It's very exciting and gripping! Can't wait for the thrill ride in season 3.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|f the story just die off or are killed conveniently and I wonder for what reason.  Surely, there are other ways to change a story line.  All in all however, I would watch it all over again as I really did like it.
006178480X|5.0|James Rollins continues to impress.  I have read all his Sigma novels and I have yet to be disappointed.  Well Done.
B00000JLWW|4.0|Got this cause I love the hours long epic movies. They pack so much in that these types of movies are something you want to watch at least once a year. Packaging, case, dvd, all in great shape when it arrived.
B00AWKZSNM|5.0|It works great but I found that it didn't work as well with WD hard drives I have a WD and a Toshiba and with the WD it only allowed about 80% of files to play but on the Toshiba for some reason they all play perfect I figure it has something with the two different firmware but I am not an engineer I am not sure but once I figured it out I have no problems in the two weeks that I have owned. hope this helps.
B003U6BE8I|4.0|Wanted the movie for my collection, since I found it entertaining when I first watched it and there is another coming out. Seller sent me a dvd disk that's in great shape, packaging kept it safe while in the mail. Pleased with everything.
B002XTBEDI|5.0|The cast and the production are a delight. When I crave a period piece this set of stories fulfills all the requirements.
B00080ZG1A|4.0|Another DiCaprio movie to add to the collection. Disk in great shape, fast delivery. Very pleased to find an affordable copy so easily.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I have always been ...and always shall be...a trekkie. It is nice to have that infusion of Trek once in a while, and it just keeps getting better. I shared Star Trek with my dad when it first was broadcast and even though he can't follow the quick pace of the newer movies we still had that love of the series that carries me through the newer movies. I was particularly struck by the choices for the lead characters...they all nailed it!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Changed my mind!  it does come in handy...    Works very well...
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Good story line. Moves at a good pace. Makes me want to spend more time connecting with the earth. Entertaining.
1250012570|5.0|Honestly, when I first saw this novel, I was amused by the simple but effective cover. The ampersand (&) shape made by the twisted cord promised me a lighthearted story of two teenagers finding first love.<br /><br />Well, was I in for a shock.<br /><br />Eleanor & Park is the literary equivalent of a girl who kisses you passionately, then slaps you, then kisses you more passionately the second time. You endure the burning feeling on your cheek because you've just got to have more of those kisses. You simply can't help yourself.<br /><br />This novel is a perfect combination of equal parts romance and suspense with a heaping spoonful of 1980's nostalgia for those who grew up in that time.<br /><br />Rainbow Rowell poignantly exposes the myriad of insecurities that nearly all teens suffer through, many in silence. Ms. Rowell reveals the achingly painful psychological wounds that some teens inflict onto each other.<br /><br />Eleanor and Park are two socially-challenged teenagers who are flung together by fate. Despite their initial misgivings about each other, they find common ground through the relationship 'glue' that binds many teenagers together: music and comic books. Over time, they develop a friendship that transforms into a first-time romance: the kind where a mere touch of a hand can heal your heart, and a kiss can elevate your soul to a higher plane.<br /><br />Throughout the novel, Rowell skillfully weaves in the growing specter of Eleanor's psychological sexual abuse from her stepfather. She brings the story to a climax where you are rooting for both of them to make it to safety and still be able to stay together.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE: Stay for the kisses.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|It is really creepy. Easy to get around once you get the hang of the directions. Long down load and install  for a game
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|It should have the highlighteing feature to be almost perfect.<br /><br />Tanking notes and be able to share them is very useful. However for most serious high level studies (masters, phD) it´s needed to highlitght
B0043D2FB2|2.0|The index in this Kindle book has neither page numbers nor is activated to take one to the topics, making it utterly useless for searching. A glaring oversight by the publishers. The table of contents also has no page numbers, tho' it is clickable.
B009KLH0KS|1.0|The CDS are good, though the sound quality is poor, mixed badly. The band is good, and Jason Bonham does a great job filling in for his late dad. But the DVD WOULD NOT PLAY, and I tried it on several different players. BE WARNED!
B00BQ1D7BQ|4.0|Just a great blues album overall.  Unique blend of musical talents that really comes together nicely.  Definitely recommend to blues fans.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I can not believe this is a free game! The graphics are great, the mechanics are quick and easy to learn, and the game itself is addictive. The minions are so cute, too! What's not to love? Everyone needs to get this game NOW!!!! It's the best thing u could ever get!!
B007JMW46U|5.0|Really enjoyed reading this on the Kindle app! Some reviews complained about garbled text in their copies but I didn't have any trouble. All of the text was readable.
B005MHI0QM|5.0|You share Anne's troubles and triumphs, hopes and dreams, and loves and hates. You feel as if you are living in the Secret Annex with Anne yourself. You'll smile at such moments like when Anne and Peter kiss. You'll laugh at Mrs. van Daan's pet peeves. But you'll especially cry. Especially when you read after the actual diary that Anne and the members of the Secret Annex were taken away. Only 1 member survived, Anne's father. You'll cry knowing that poor, young Anne was taken away from her parents and sent to a concentration camp. She died just a little while before the camp was liberated. Peter died just a few days before his camp was liberated. You'll be left thinking &#34;Why couldn't she have lived just a few more days? Why?&#34;.<br /><br />What makes her story so sad is the fact that she had so much to offer, had she lived to maturity. One can almost be certain that she would have had much more to contribute to literature, to history. As it is, we have only this brilliant diary, and what a piece of work it is.<br /><br />This book is truly a must read
B004LZRSBY|5.0|The concert is incredible every body loves the concert in the house my 5 and 6 year old kids favorite maybe they watched it 10 times still want to watch it again.
B00BIKCYAU|5.0|If you thought season 1 was amazing... Just wait until you watch season 2. GOT is by far, the best middle earth type television show ever. Can't wait to get season 3.
B006S01GH2|5.0|This movie is a brilliant, fun romantic comedy with a twist. It is a great film to make you smile.
B008CLI3TE|5.0|GOF is a wonderful middle earth masterpiece. Each episode leaves you wanting more. Highly recommended. Can't wait to watch season 2.
037582913X|5.0|I loved this book from when I was a child.  I love sharing this with my 1 year-old at bedtime.  SHe really likes this book.
B000002I53|3.0|Nothing against John Coltrane or his music. I had never really listened to much jazz and what I did hear and liked was a smoother rendition of songs. I had also ordered an R&B instrumental CD and it was more what I wanted. My son likes jazz so I blessed him with this and another jazz CD.
0786868694|5.0|Has all the little but simple things you would like to be able to cook. Her books are a delight just to read.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This game is really fun and it is nothing u can go to when you have time and u don't need to do any thing so if your just sitting at home you should get littlest petshops
B005LQ6UE8|3.0|Much is unbelievable.  Considered to be hoax fiction.  No water in dessert for nearly two weeks? Did they really get to India?
B0087IT8FK|5.0|LOVED it! Cracked up at some of the antics in the movie. Subtitles didn't bother me, if I really like a movie it doesn't matter. It will make you cry, laugh out loud & reflect on your own life. Feel good movie :)
B00CE03UOC|5.0|Even though I've only completed twenty levels, I am already addicted. Can't wait to get to the bigger more complex puzzles.  Will be playing this game for some time to come!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great suspense novel, keeps you up at night wanting to read the next twist! Maybe there will be a part 2?
B000I9UA8U|5.0|Hilarious. I would recommend it to anyone out for a good laugh. It's a classic that I think will be timeless even in 100 years
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use this on my Android tablet and have not problems.  I made the mistake of buying a different version for an earlier tablet, but had no repair option when the screen was cracked.  That tablet was not Android and also slower and cumbersome to operate.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is an awesome game and I guarantee that you will love it! Horse lovers will love this game and the ponys on it!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Really enjoying the game but can be frustrating when you get into it and then run out of energy! You can buy more crystals from the shop but that could end up costing you a lot of money. I just leave the game for a few hours and then the energy is restored with out spending. For this reason only it gets 4 stars from me.
B003EYVXTG|4.0|I have just finished the movie--decided not to watch first, but went ahead anyway. The teenage character was simply superb. I did not see the methamphetamine side of the story as much as I noticed the utterly desperate human side, as well as the unique social code in effect in that part of the country. It's as if one were looking at a different America, where the sky is forever gray. The story told is one of many families' who hold on to each other despite setbacks, and unfortunately, as a result of their loving attachment, many remain where they are, and the cycle of poverty and wrong turns in life keep on. The movie is not about one topic, it's a depressing tapestry, artfully woven.<br />Ending has a clue to a tragedy. I encourage you to think several times why the uncle tells the girl to keep the banjo. There is a hint of goodbye in that scene.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and downloaded the next book straight away. I loved the pace of the story, the fantasy theme and the development/description of the characters  Delighted there are 7 books in the series.  Make it into a movie or series for HBO!
B0067RQYNW|5.0|Stumbled on this app by accident and it has made my kindle fire hd much more helpful, prior to this app the kindle was just something that was compact, convenient & fun to play with and  this app has made it much more practicle with the office features I need.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome so much fun  it gust like temple run<br />Best game ever u got to try it tots awwaome dude.
B00CX7TOOG|3.0|Of the 100+ reviews here, they seem very evenly split between 1-star and 5-star reviews. They average a \\"3\\" and that's what I gave it. It's a talky movie with good scenery and some action with 2 big stars and a Big Message. Problem for me was \\"What's the message\\"? Futility of war? Mankind once again sinking to the lowest common denominator (atrocities on both sides)? War is bad? Or if you lose yourself in the horror, what do you become? Is there atonement or forgiveness down the line - if so, where and when? OK, you get the idea. The 2 main characters did not ring true for me, just did not seem realistic, I felt they were acting 'too hard' to be believable. Travolta especially, but De Niro hasn't really shown us anything new in quite awhile either. They did OK - faint praise, I know, but that's how I feel about the whole movie. You want to see 2 enemies going at it in a much better and more realistic film, see 1968's \\"Hell in the Pacific\\".
B00881VLCE|5.0|Magic Puzzles has become my favorite game app.  There have been a few problems along the way but Ximad has worked out it's little annoying bugs. The puzzles are easier to work in comparison to other jigsaw apps I've downloaded.  They changed their puzzle 'cutter' and it's a challenge again.
B00821OX98|5.0|Pretty cool show. Can't wait till the third episode becomes Prime. Would suggest  as it was a good sci- fi series.
B00821OX98|3.0|Hard to suspend the disbelief, but what the hell.  It's easy TV, and you don't have to think much.  Cheers.
B00A27X972|5.0|entertaining and a good read.  interesting way to discuss the frailty and the strengths of humanity.  read it on my kindle fire
B002CMXAYW|4.0|This movie is a witty, well-imagined classic. The soundtrack both pays homage as well as satirizes Led Zeppelin, Iron Maiden, and Van Halen perfectly. (Just to name a few examples) All of the dialogue seems genuinely improvised and works exceptionally well. Following the downward spiral of a band as catalyzed by a Yoko-Ono-esque girlfriend, the sweet reuniting of the band at the end of the film is all the more triumphant. &#34;This Is Spinal Tap&#34; is a comedy for everyone, and a horror-story for rock musicians. Either way, I would definitely give it a watch!
B004KPQK2S|5.0|This is just a great movie. Love the story and the races for the horses. The singing of &#34;O Happy Day&#34; is wonderful. Choose it and be inspired!
B00DWHWOFC|5.0|This game is great if you like logic type puzzles! It is challenging but has a variety of difficulties. Very addicting.
B00915G6MG|5.0|really enjoy this tv series-the product came in good shape-packaging was not damaged and was sealed good-the produt came on time and with no problem-
B00BTYU3SK|5.0|I saw this movie at least 20 times on TV before I decided to buy it so that I follow it up more closely with its subtitles.<br />Bravura performances by all. Countless Bravos for the cinematic technique, the script, direction, etc<br />So...whenever I am down,this is my remedy to get back to a better mood.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I really enjoyed reading part 2 of Hunger Games, but was a bit disappointed in the ending. A good way to sell the next book I guess.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Love it! It's so hard for me to put it down! Can't wait to read the 3rd book!😊 I would definitely recommend reading this Crossfire Novel!😊
B004HWYTP4|2.0|This movie was not as action packed as I thought and fun level really low. I have to watch part two now
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The device works as described, but if your TV is on the wall, you'll probably need an extension cord for the power.  Well, unless you have a TV with a powered USB port.
B00D9CDTUY|5.0|Great flick! Fast paced & action packed.<br />Never a dull moment from beginning to end.<br />Enjoyed it immensely! Get it!!!
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|I love this game. I love all the new features and new charecters.My favorite feature is buying charecters with coins you earn.My all time favorite is the porkside!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|My review would be way too long to write how much I loved this book and the other two books for this trilogy. I couldn't put any of the books down !! I was sad when I finished all of them. I just wanted them to keep going. AMAZING books !! Can't wait till the movie !
1451662432|5.0|Very nice read, nice balance of informative and entertaining. You'd be hard pressed to find an area where you weren't learning something.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The Chromecast is the easiest media device to use, period.  My mother, who is not very tech savvy, figured out how to use it by herself in no time.  I have used it for netflix, youtube, and play store and it works great in all cases.  The YouTube app is especially nice since you can browse (and add to queue) more videos while playing one on the TV.  I use Netflix every day and I never go back to my TV app anymore - Chromecast works better/faster/easier.<br /><br />I have even tried to chromecast a video from the web and it worked almost perfectly.  We watched Duck Dynasty streamed from its website on our laptop and cast it to the tv.  It worked great but you need a decent computer to do that - a low powered laptop would not be able to do that well.<br /><br />There is one thing that would make the Chromecast better - more apps.  I would love to see espn and amazon video apps for the Chromecast.
B00C8USQEM|5.0|The quality of this box set is great.  Watching the Big Bang Theory in Blu Ray was a a lot of fun.
B007N31YFW|3.0|In an unnamed Swedish city a group of six drummers/percussionists \\"terrorizes\\" people by doing unauthorized musical \\"concerts\\" at a bank or theater, using everyday objects or heavy machines. While a tone-deaf police detective Amadeus (Bengt Nilsson), who happens to be a member of a very prominent classical music family, tracks down these \\"musical terrorists\\" desperately, both sides sort of come to a mutual understanding.<br /><br />The Swedish-French movie will be remembered for its wonderful musical sequences including a dynamic highway scene and a humorous \\"bank robbery,\\" but as a feature film \\"Sound of Noise\\" needs something more than that. The film is nothing short of ambitious, a conceptually intriguing project with some social satire and a bit of romance, but the result feels like a short film extended beyond its natural running time.<br /><br />This is director team Ola Simonsson and Johannes Stjärne Nilsson's first feature film. They have a quirky comedic sense that works well in some unusual situations, and two musical bits (set in a hospital and a bank) are very impressive. Unfortunately, the characters and their backstories are not as interesting as these antics. The film's non-musical sections often drag.<br /><br />\\"Sound of Noise\\" is an amusing film based upon a unique premise, but the film's innovative ideas could have been better made use of by giving more thought to the characters.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|The game was fun. As soon as the game got interesting, the free game ended.  Way too soon! Easy to find objects and love the music.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Grate Brooklyn landscape . True to life profile of addiction . Grate direction . Ellen Burstyn and a fabulous brake out cast of actors !
B00BHMF578|5.0|Great movie and story, very stressful watching even with knowing what the outcome would be.  Loved the 70s costumes and settings.
B00DP8XSQ2|5.0|This is a great app for looking at the night sky.  It is easy to use (though it does take a minute to load up) and a lot of fun to see what stars and constellations are in the sky, either at night or during the day.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Not really liking the new series and most could cure insomnia, but this one isn't quite as bad as the last couple.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|Purchased this app for my tablet and now when I press download it says downloading but doesn't. I don't get it. Free apps from the Amazon store have always downloaded just fine.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Loved the series and watched it several times. Movie is a great conclusion and am very happy to have it in my collection
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great fun for the whole family. Kids loved it;Hours of fun. Easy to follow directions.  Highly Recomend<br />Lots of laughs too.
B003BVFZ4Q|4.0|Very good book. It makes me want to read more books by Stephen King. For example Joyland and 11/22/63  in this book King is very open and humble.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Love this game very challenging enjoy the hidden games as well I enjoy playing any type of channeling games just wish you didn't have to pay for energy s many times during the game
B007BVOEPI|5.0|very creative work coming from some brilliant minds and fantasy writers...this is one of those series you would like to see for many, many years.
B00D9PUXQY|5.0|superb album, this band just keeps getting better.  The CD, DVD combo is perfect, because the DVD compliments the CD.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I have always love  to play with hair. This game takes it to new awesomeness. As a thirteen year old, I am not expected to log  to play a little kid game. But I love it. Great job toca. However, I do agree that they need more characters and maybe some makeup. I also wish that they would get a a like popular blonde so you can do that hair. Overall it is five stars.
B005LAIGF0|5.0|I finally got around to watching the extended director's cut (at 3 three hours) of this 2006 film that was finally released theatrically in 2011 and for home theater at the end of last year.  Wow, I was mesmerized by this unexpectedly compelling -- almost operatic -- story of a 17-year-old New York City high-school student (Anna Paquin) who believes she has unintentionally caused a traffic accident that killed a woman.<br /><br />Her desire to set things right is met with opposition at every step. Torn apart by guilt and frustration that justice is an increasingly distant option, she punishes herself with self-loathing and hurts those around her as she realizes the real world of adults is a nebulous place where doing what's right is a foggy ideal seldom clearly defined.<br /><br />Margaret is not a character in the movie but rather a reference in Gerard Manley Hopkins 1888 poem \\"Spring and Fall.\\" Hopkins asks: \\"Margaret, are you grieving, Over Goldengrove unleaving?\\" and then answers at poem's end \\"...It is the blight man was born for, It is Margaret you mourn for.\\"<br /><br />The theatrical release has a running time of 150 minutes and it's the Blu-ray disc on the combo pack.  The far superior, more richly detailed and moody director's cut is 180 minutes and is on the DVD.  But it's the latter that seems shorter.  The superb supporting cast includes: Matthew Broderick, Matt Damon, Jean Reno, Allison Janney, and Mark Ruffalo among others.  It's safe to say this singular film has already garnered a cult following as an ever-growing number people continue to stumbled on this hellish emotionally journey of realization and redemption.
B00BP29SAA|5.0|I like this game and people who want to BUY IT trust me it is educational too I definitely recommend this app to kids
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Now I can watch YouTube on my older, not so smart Visio TV.  It only works with 3 apps at this time, but YouTube was the reason I wanted it and looking forward to more apps that work with the Chromecast.
B008VBYN80|5.0|I love this game. I love to build my own community and you get to play with friends online! Just install!!!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This one is bettet than google play store alarms and does not have any bugs. A good app for android device.
B00AEBEQW8|3.0|The story is awesome.  However, the kindle version is difficult to read the letters from the crayons. Still cute, though.
B000SVZIDA|4.0|Don't expect to be moved in a conventional way by this film.  It is a most imaginative pantomime blending music, dancing, and acting. Visually stunning, it is a successful attempt at changing the meaning of a &#34;musical.&#34;
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I use it on all my devices iOS (iPad, Iphone, iPod, Apple TV), Andoid, PC and Mac. I have my music in one place.
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|The Bat is a terrific novel with plot twists and excellent character development. Anyone familiar with Jo Nesbo, will thoroughly enjoy reading this fantastic story.
B00DQVSTCG|2.0|I ADORE Madonna and have followed her since she released &#34;Like a Virgin&#34;, however I cannot believe she allowed to release this crap<br /><br />I was in denial when I read that there was no sound coming out from of the right surround speaker or the Low Frequency Effects (LFE) / Subwoofer channel until I played it in my system<br /><br />The video is amazing and it cannot be compared with any other source, however the sound is something else... MEDIOCRE, MEDIOCRE, MEDIOCRE... Perhaps Madonna allowed Rocco to play with the console??<br /><br />Unreal that LiveNation or InterScope allowed to release this Blu-Ray without even bother doing Quality Assurance (QA) to the DTS-HD Master Audio track<br /><br />The other audio-tracks are ok, but mediocre, the sound level is so low, that you have to crank up the volume of your receiver.<br /><br />I think the audio-track was somehow OVERCOOKED. I attended the concert in Toronto Canada and have videos shot with my iPhone and those have better audio and BASS BASS plenty of BASS. I believe they re-recorded or cleaned up the soundtrack excessively<br /><br />I've seen videos in YouTube with better audio-editing<br /><br />The menus of the disc are crap as well. Bad bad bad usability and it is hard to navigate through them<br /><br />Anyway, DO NOT buy this release. Wait for the revised version or buy the video available in iTunes
0143122843|5.0|I've read 5 novels in this series so far and found them to be so packed full of intriguing characters and events.  The only negative is the fact that I often awake very early in the day to read more. I'm losing a lot of sleep.
B00F35B8F8|5.0|I really love this movie, great flick. Tons of action, great plot, and the CG is incredible. I Highly recommend it.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|I liked what they did and did not do a redo of the original. I did not know that when i sat down to watch it. the other thing i really liked is that it was okay for the kids.  There is one marginally scary part when the monkeys fly in to attack but really it shows their scary face for MAYBE 5 seconds. Great family movie!
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|The best pinball yet! The sound and gameplay are perfect!old school play and old school sound! I love this game.......
B00COHIFQS|5.0|It keeps changing and making you guess.  It is very scarry but a little hokey at parts. But all movies in this genre are
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Well written book about a very different and interesting person. Not the background I'd expect of a self made billionaire.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|This is probably the shortest performance that Channing Tatum has ever had! lol. But the movie is good, has great twists and keeps you guessing
B0064MGU98|5.0|Great Show! This show makes binge view!!! Keeps you on the edge and is an attention grabber! 5 stars, all the way!
B00CL68BK2|5.0|My new cry movie. but in a good way. Amazing plot and story and cast... So well played. You get into their lives and it sucks you in and you forget that you are watching a movie.
B009GED3HS|5.0|Loved this season. This show just gets better. Loved the way the writers told Barney and Robin's story. Can't wait to see how the end this series.
B00CL6GAD2|5.0|Great story line and plot. Suspensful and Mark Walberg was just as amazing as ever.  Sure maybe a little predictable and violent but that was what made it great!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Yes, I can agree this app does use more than it's share of battery, but it quite literally is a life saver.  Unfortunately, satellite Tv does not give specific warnings like local channels if you are watching movies or sleep with the television on like I do. This little app woke me up, warning me of severe weather approaching. I had just enough time to batten down the hatches and get my animals protected before it hit. Thanks Weather Channel!
B00C7DGRL4|4.0|I thought it was going to be hokey. It was actually entertaining and good if not a little gorry but I would watch again
B00992CF6W|5.0|perfect great view there is a whole bunch of things. you can do. you can even update.<br />it is perfect it very fun and you never run out of thins to do.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I really like the one tap boost feature.  When the rest of the apps are making my android slow down, this program makes it run faster.  So glad I found it!
B00D6C0D42|5.0|As timely now as ever. A great double or even triple feature when presented with Putney Swope and or Jacob's Ladder.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|.. with the love story continuing to unfold! Such nuanced plots, such interesting characters and backdrop...simply, so romantic. Anxiously waiting for book 3.
B000VZYPB4|3.0|I would have ranked the product higher but even with having high speed internet the streaming was choppy in HD
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The last of the series was as expected. I enjoyed it as I did the others. The entire series was definitely worth reading.
0399165274|4.0|It's no \\"Day of the Jackal,\\" but it's still better than 90% of the espionage/action novels out there. Forsyth has always been my favorite author.  \\"Day of the Jackal\\" is the best novel ever written in the genre.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|If you want to read about kinky sex then this is the book for you! I read the trilogy and this was my least favorite of the three. That said, give it a try. Many I've spoken with couldn't make it through the first book due to the repetitive sexual content. You need to keep in mind this is fiction. Enough said.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Seems like JJ Abrahams has really captured the spirit of Star Trek once again. The stage is set to boldly go where no movie has gone before.
B00915G6YE|5.0|Just finish the series this week.  Cant wait for season 8th to be on the market.  As they say the plot thicken.
B00EPVTLKU|5.0|Its so fun to listen to and she has such a nice voice :) I love the 1950's vibe to it!
B009ZQJ0ME|3.0|Equilibrium was an ok movie.  I suppose a world without emotion is difficult to portray because I just didn't feel it.
B00AZL3PBK|1.0|This game is great until you reach level 3-1. You're doomed from the moment the level starts. You don't even get a chance to begin playing the level because it starts dropping you to your unfortunate demise the moment the level starts, giving you no chance to move or jump. If the developers fix this I would gladly raise my rating to five stars but until then it will remain at one.
B008Y6YCB0|5.0|This is not the best-known Jane Austen book/movie, but it is a warm, human story, with well-developed characters and good values.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I am hooked on this series and can't wait until Season 4.  The DVDs arrived quickly and I finished the season before the complete airing on PBS.
B003VANOFY|4.0|I use these headphones as my main phone at work and for listening to music. I love the wireless mobility. It has good range too. It is supposed to be good for 40' but I get more like 60' - 70' range in my office. The headphones are comfortable even when wearing for many hours. The mute button and being able to mute / unmute by putting the mic up or down is convenient. The headphones run for many hours on a charge.<br /><br />My only complaints with these headphones are that the charging cable is sometimes hard to plug in/out and sometimes it takes a couple tries to get them to turn off. If I could add features to my wish list I would also want these headphones to be noise canceling.
B007EECSFA|4.0|It was unpredictable.  I like it when they switch from present to past. I also liked that it took place in England.
B008GAT3S6|5.0|This book in my opinion contains everything you wanna know about animation.<br />As much as you can take from it you can make good animation and develope it gradually to be the best because it's the essence of a great animator's experience who is fond of animation.
B00E5Q1LTY|4.0|the cast really know their characters, they do not disappoint in giving us the humor, tension, and all out thrill ride you expect from this new version of Star Trek.  Benedict Cumberbatch was excellent!
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Drifter with a cause. This ain't no Tom cruise ese. Read it and enjoy it. Us madre would like it
B00D5LC4GY|4.0|Like I said it is fun to play, I found myself playing this game for hours. It my become addictive to me.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|it kind of scary but very very fun u got to play it come on and play it.  thinks friends.
B00DU74U74|1.0|The posted description if the film is very vague and doesn't give a feel for the movie. Now I understand why; there is nothing interesting to say about the film.
B00DT99BX6|5.0|What happens if you've got everything that money can buy, but you feel that your life is nothing but a prison? Would you be willing to give it all up, even your own identity, for freedom?<br /><br />Camile has the world at her feet. But she's miserable because there's something missing in her life. Constantly watching over her shoulder, and being followed by her bodyguards, Camile rebels against her father's rules, always searching for that missing piece. And one day, when she had escaped from her father's watchful eyes, she finds it- or shall I say him?<br /><br />I can't say enough about the hero of this story. He is hot, a bad a**, and mysterious- a beautiful dark haired stranger with green eyes. Camile is drawn to him but he resists. I enjoyed watching his inner struggles of wanting to be with her but resisting because that was the right thing to do.<br /><br />When Camile's life is truly in danger, the beautiful green-eyed stranger shows up again. But is he a friend or a foe? In my opinion, this male lead made the story. He was wise, a warrior, and did I already mention hot? I got the feeling that he would have protected her `till the end, even at the cost of his own life.<br /><br />Pawn of Innocence was just the perfect read- a nice escape. Sometimes I found myself smiling and at times I had goose bumps. If you're looking for a good romance, full of suspense, then this story is for you.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|Gerard Butler is perfectly cast as Erik (The Phantom). Mimi Driver is perfect as the Diva. In my opinion this is probably the best thing Andrew Lloyd Weber ever composed. The music is spell binding and emotional. However, this is nothing like the book, and is in fact an over romanticized version of it. This rendition of  Phantom of the Opera is still a masterpiece.
B00B19G01C|4.0|I liked the thought that the father was put in a situation were he had to come to grips with the supernatural. It was a nice change for a possession plot, the content and script were not amazing, but I loved the father and daughter connection. This movie with it's mild scares, is a great horror flick to watch again and again.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I can't find anything wrong with this game. It is quite enjoyable to play as a time waster. Although I didn't understand why it sent me back to the first level after I beat the third level. But it didn't bother me too much.
B008X6N1OA|5.0|Good use of 3D.<br />At times, perhaps a little too much 3D poking at the face with swords and such; But great use of 3D otherwise.  As with all sequels to a good original, it was different from the first in some ways.  They did a good job reinventing some aspects of the movie to make it fresh, but similar to the first one.
B00F91RYL8|2.0|I'm still wondering why Brad Pitt is in this movie.  His character is not convincing at all and anyone could have played his role and probably would have been more convincing.  All I can remember after watching this movie is why the long greasy hair and why Brad Pitt as the leading character.  Must have been for box office draw because in my opinion...he ruined the movie. I wish I would have waited until it came out on TV for free. Special effects-  what special effects.  Nothing new here folks.  Same old same old zombie movie theme only these zombies don't bleed at all and neither do the people they bite. If you're expecting a gory movie - this is not for you as it was not for me.  A good 3rd grader movie- MAYBE.
B0034G4OYK|5.0|The whole family loves this movie.  The movie has great use of 3D for depth of field during the movie. It has some good reach out and get you 3D moments.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|The book is much better than the movie. I enjoyed being in his mind to know what he was thinking.  The only con is that I don't like sports talk.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|The whole family loves this movie.  The movie has great use of 3D for depth of field during the movie, along with some great reach out and touch you moments.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome soon i will max everything and I will buy everyone. Thanks for this awesome game. You should download this game because it has all your<br />favorite characters from the movie.
B00DQVST76|1.0|I purchased this dvd. Version of the mdna tour and the picture is fantastic but the audio is horrible audio is only on the center  left chanel and left rear have sound the right rear and right chanel have. None in dts it douse work in 2 channel but  the dts is a defective mix. I wonder why madonna would let that out to the public whith this issue I just wanted to let people know all the other reviews I read were for the bluray I didn't see any for the dvd version the bluray and dvd both have issues. Be careful when purchasing this . Hopefully 4his will be released the concert is fantastic to bad the dts isn't as good as the concert .thanks for reading my review
B0091REZMW|5.0|I reached level thirty, and then the game totally died on me, I reinstalled finally but lost all my progress/friends, was disappointing, especially as it takes a long time to level up etc. Anyway I still recommend this game, it has kept my interest, it has lots of levels and quests to keep you occupied and you don't have to pay to play.A definate download people!!!
B009RX85N0|5.0|It's very creative stories and while you are watching every episode, you just can't stop! Wish the season 3 will be released soon!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Good book that provides the complexity of the life of several characters in different time periods and socio political contexts
B00992CF6W|5.0|Really fun you should get it if I where to rate it I would give it a 8 sideways!!!<br />AWSOME!!!!! Am I rite get it!!!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This was a very good book.  At first a little trouble keeping<br />the characters straight, but as the book continues you will<br />have it all straightened out.  I would definitely recommend this<br />book.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|When you buy a romance/erotica the last thing you think will happen, is to laugh so loud while reading it, that people look at you funny! I laughed throughout the book and it was like going on a holiday, forgotten was all the stuff that needs to be done, all I could do was read on. I could not put this book down, I could not wait to see what the next gem Drew (the main male character) came up with! Do not misunderstand me, it is a beautiful romance too, filled with sexy scenes and all, but the best part was the humour. If one actually think about it, it is humourous when two people fall in love, all the things that happen because people are in love, the things they think and so on. They say laughter is the best medicine, well laughter and love combined is probably the elixir of life!<br />I definately recommend this book to all out there, who are able to see the funny side of life!!!
B00F91SCXC|5.0|We enjoyed the flick start to finish- Wish we would have taken the time to see it on the big screen
B0019CSXAM|5.0|Bought dvd on a thursday it came the next friday! A great addition to my How I met Your Mother Collection, Dvd is in good condition as well! Thanks again
B00E5Q1LTY|4.0|Very good movie I would recommend it to friends of mine I have seen it a few times now and still a good movie
B007SYWFRM|5.0|It is a good game for someone that is just learning how to play on this new technology if I do say so myself
B00CWV8X04|3.0|It was painful movie, poorly done. Pathetic acting mostly<br />its apparent I need to pay more attention to the critics outside of Amazon
B00EY8A6BC|3.0|Not bad. You have to suspend your disbelief in a big part of the plot line but it is entertaining.
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|We found this to be a better then good story, not great.<br />This story was made for Cruise, it was him 100%<br />We enjoyed it completely
B007KDFWRG|3.0|Saw the Tedeschi - Trucks Band last night, and wanted to jot down a few thoughts about the show.<br />1st, Beacon is a great venue to see a live performance. Fabulous acoustics. Todd Snider opened the show w/ an enjoyable 1/2 hour blues/folk solo set. He's different, and interesting in his vocal and guitar phrasing. Give him a listen.<br /><br />2nd, TTB was good to very good, but lacked a certain passion/feeling to call the show great. Played a 2 hour nonstop set, highlighting most of their most recent releases. Pluses - Tedeschi can really belt 'em out; Trucks can make the guitar sing, wail, cry, use whatever modifier you like. These are givens.<br />Minuses - Derek is a statue; no indication he's even breathing. For a front man in a blues based 10 piece outfit, he's a visual anchor; kinda like he's really bored and going through the motions. While technically astonishing, I found his guitar playing to be one solo like the next like the next, etc.. I contrast him with Clapton, Santana, Schon, and find him slightly behind them in flow of his guitar solos. The horn section lacks punch; I personally feel a trombone has no place on stage in this kind of band. One of the male rhythm singers sang in an almost falsetto; not pleasing, at least to my ears. Keyboardist was terrific, as were percussionists. My biggest beef is that the extended jams lacked the flow and musicality of the Dead, or Cream, or the Allmans. I found myself waiting for the jams to be over; that's wrong. I also found myself waiting for the band to hit their stride, and really start to cook; never happened. This parallels many of the minuses in the reviews of Everybody's Talkin'. Don't get me wrong; I enjoyed the show, and felt the band was giving it their best, but never hit their stride. I've seen YouTube videos wherein they appeared to be more cohesive/coherent/inspired. Mike Madison(?) belted out a single fine song (can't recall the name of it, though); he'd be a welcome addition with more lead vocals.<br /><br />All replies welcome. Thanx for reading.
B00DGN51O8|3.0|Glad I watched , it was a fun movies, great fairy tale.<br />Well done, not a &#34;put you to sleep&#34; movie
B00D7JGL36|5.0|Two of the all time greats hit a grand slam. I listen to this over & over.  A great tribute to Merle & Buck!
B00CL68BK2|5.0|All actors are great, exellent story.<br />An excellent real medical problem brought to the big screen.<br />This beats Netflix every time.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|It works extremelywell for fictional reading, since one can click on word and have a dictionary come up, but it would be nice to have page numbers and some sort of overall navigation for technical reading.
B00ECU2SGS|4.0|Typical southern McConaughey movie. Story was a little slwo at times but was expected providing that southern attitude......good job McConaughey
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is highly addicting and I am impressed that it is free!  I am a little embarrassed about the number of hours I have spent playing this game =)
B00D6BU8GG|5.0|There goes Willis kicking ass again in another creative......wait a minute this is the same story line again, and again, and a again.
B00D1DBO1C|4.0|This is an app I use literally EVERY day.  I am impressed that it is free.  Love that it syncs with my google calendar.  I think I'd be lost without it! =)
B00DBSZEH2|4.0|Now this is one violent movie for a fairy tale. Gretel's hot too.......nice.<br />What can you say, except if you like exaggerated stories
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I've read it twice now. So beautifully written. You will be pulled right in to the lives of Diana and Matthew. I never want the story to end, but very much look forward to the third book (I've read the second already) in the trilogy. Romantic and exciting and filled with magic.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Good book.  A person could read it just it for the action but, with a little thought, most readers could begin to question how they fit in the world and how much responsibility they should accept for their actions and the ensuing consequences.  A good book for a teen or adult.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|This is a Google app, so how do you rate that? I like using Google more than any other search engine; that's why I gave it five stars. Plus it works just fine on my Kindle Fire.
B0030T0VFC|5.0|nice detailing even down to the hoof prints!  The coloring is so authentic.  Very durable and tolerates hard play outside or inside.
B009PNQUXO|1.0|I downloaded this app by mistake. After the download had started, I realized it wasn't what I thought it was. But, I decided to try it anyway. This thing didn't work properly on my Kindle so I uninstalled it. I wouldn't  recommend this app.
0061232084|2.0|You are better off just reading the Wikipedia article for free. Doesn't do a good job portraying the characters or the LBO process.
B009JZVT70|5.0|One of the best fantasy TV series ever, The Fairy tail character's keep coming with strange new twistCan't wait for the next season
B000WTXD30|5.0|Takes me back to younger days.  As always, Elton's tunes are timeless.  I would recommend this to anyone who loves 70's music.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|As an avid zomboe lover, thos this pretty darn good, not gunna lie.Up  there with 28 Days.Fully enjoyed it, would watch again.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|If you want your heart ripped from your chest, read this book. One of the most compelling, heartwarming stories I have read in a long while. Highly recommend it.
0374533571|5.0|I read Silver Linings Playbook in about three days. I'd had the book sitting for a few months, and wanted very much to read it before seeing the movie. But once I started, I simply could not stop.  It was one of the quickest reads I've had in a long time. If I'd had the time, I would have read it in one sitting. You can read it without effort, broken up into short bursts of chapters. It flows - such an easy, quick read - which I liked.<br /><br />I found it to be very funny. I didn't laugh out loud a lot, although I did a few times, but I definitely smiled to myself a lot. I'm a sports fan (not a football fan) but I found the Eagles obsession to be very funny. Probably because I believe it to be true. The scenes with his father made me sad, but I also found them to be very typical family moments, and that was comforting.<br /><br />I found Pat very sympathetic as a character. Life doesn't turn out exactly the way we all want it to. Sometimes we don't get everything when we want it, sometimes we don't get it at all, and wind up with something different. That's true of us all. And important for us all to remember.<br /><br />I think it was a fascinating journey that Pat took and I was more than happy to take it with him. I'll hold some of his observations as I go forward, and I do think it'll make me think about certain things differently. No one is perfect, you do not always know what goes on in someone's mind or behind closed doors. So never pretend you know the whole story. It was a simple lesson, but a really great story.<br /><br />As a fan of Pat Peoples, I'd thoroughly recommend. And with 10 pages to go, I already stopped to rent the DVD so I'm looking forward to watching that tonight to finally see how they compare.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Pam puts things in easy to do steps.<br /><br />It also provides conditions where you can see the results within a time frame
0744014956|3.0|As an avid strategy guide collector, I always liked buying guides around release time to familiarise myself with the game and, if MP is included, the online as well.  These usually include tips, explanations, layouts of maps, strategies, etc etc.<br /><br />Now it is a fact that some developers like to keep the multiplayer aspects of their games under wraps, without so much as a Beta, such as Call of Duty games.  But even guides for these games contain detailed explanation of multiplayer.<br /><br />This book, however, does NOT.<br /><br />For the singleplayer aspect, the game is formidably punctilious and detailed to the point of pedantry, with illustrations to help you along the way in every single player aspect.<br /><br />I know GTA online is a \\"separate game\\" (even though it's in the disc but I digress), but it's still contained within the game and constitutes an important and a much trumpeted component of GTA (not to mention the plethora of Trophies/Achievements dedicated to GTA Online).<br /><br />This is a great guide for single player, for completing the game to a painstaking 100%.  But if you are hoping for info on MP and that constitutes an important aspect, then I'd just wait.<br /><br />I gave it a three because it is, by strategy guide standards, \\"incomplete;\\" it contains everything there is to know about singleplayer, but in such exhaustiveness they ignored the MP aspect altogether as though it doesn't exist (it does, it's just not out yet by the time I type this).
0307352153|5.0|Susan Cain did her research well. Every introvert should read this book! I had the opportunity to see her speak as a keynote and she was phenomenal! If you are hesitant on buying it, check out her TED talk – you won't be disappointed.
B009NFHF0Q|2.0|Not really my type of book.  Read it for a book club, but would not have chosen it on my own.
0385528752|4.0|The Heath brothers did a great job writing this book and explaining success stories of encouraging change. I would definitely recommend reading it.
B008133MDK|5.0|Like the fact that it was easy to follow and got you looking for answers.  Looking forward to the next season.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|While all horror-genre movies try to get you to care about the characters, it's a rare feat to actually make that happen. Usually there is at least one character where I am rooting for the zombies. In The Walking Dead, the character story lines and interactions make the situations they're in feel genuine and you can't help but get involved. It is sort of a soap opera with zombies as instigators. Gotta love that!
B00DI75SWM|5.0|This app is wonderful you get to share stuff with your friend's on Facebook before I got this app and it was a lot better then my old app like this but that one was terrible
B004P8JPS6|5.0|I like Lee Child's writing style.  His stories are exciting, and his characters are believable.  Vey well written mystery. I will definitely read more of the books in this series.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Had weather channel app for a couple of months. Didn't like all the ads. The app actually crashed. It was not a useful app, uninstalled it.
B00915G6SU|5.0|BD gift for spouse and love it...Haven't played it yet...The product is in great condition, came very prompt, just as it was advertised and in great condition ...very happy
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is awesome. my face game on my kindle fire. I think there should be more obstacles. you should just down load it know. ;)
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I have to admit, I read this series right after I finished Twilight (back when the first Twilight movie came out). I was strolling through Borders and saw these books prominently displayed on an endcap with praise from Stephenie Meyers all over the front covers. So I HAD to have them!<br /><br />The first thing that grabbed my attention was Clary's insatiable curiosity. From the start, I could NOT put this book down! From the magic system to the supernatural creatures, throw in some awesome action scenes, and of course, budding romances. Ah! This book was just filled with juicy yumminess, complex characters, an expanding storyline, twists and turns and surprises, hidden cities, tasty teases, and snarky supernaturals! The author is SO GOOD at writing scenes that got my heart pounding and blood flowin'! Seriously, I got so sucked in to this story that I forbade myself from reading it on my lunch break at work. No, for this story, I wanted the comfort of my own home so I could gasp, shudder, cry, laugh, smirk, and fantasize!<br /><br />I will say, I was totally miffed at the ending. I won't go into details. I'm sure a lot of you out there already know the part I'm talking about. So yeah, I was pretty peeved at Clare for doing that to her readers. Still, I'm a romantic at heart and hoped that the author would eventually reveal something, whether it be some twist, some magical act, whatever - to mend the tortured heart I was vicariously experiencing through Clary. So, naturally, I jumped right in to the second book, City of Ashes.<br /><br />Obviously the book has received a strong following being that it has hit the Big Screen!
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|This is one of the best games I have played. I think this is the easiest of the 3 Cut The Rope games but it still a great game.  ;)
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Despite all the hype, I just couldn't get into this book. The dialogue was SO cheesy, the characters were shallow. The erotic scenes seemed repetitive - at least the author used a lot of the same (or very similar) words to describe the recurrent sex scenes. The plot was flat. This book just didn't do it for me. I honestly do not know why a movie is being made. Maybe the producer will add some depth and passion to this tale<br /><br />If you're looking for a really good S&M type book that has a better plot and an experienced, well-read author, check out A.N. Roquelaure's (a.k.a. Anne Rice) Sleeping Beauty series (The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty, Beauty's Punishment, and Beauty's Release). Now there's a series that will get your body pumping!<br /><br />Overall rating: 1 out of 5 stars
0307476464|4.0|Where two lovers travel in a parallel universe to find each other and explore the meaning of reality, under the light of two moons. Aomame, the gentle gym instructor and secretly a violent men's implacable nemesis, and Tengo, math teacher and aspiring writer whose major writing experience is rewriting the strange novel of a dyslexic teen, have met when children, and lost each other. They now live loveless lives, but the bizarre events in the world of<br />1Q84 will  unite them against all odds, A mesmerizing, captivating novel, whose only flaw is an excessively long third part, where action drags on and an unnecessary third POV character is introduced. And need one be informed in detail of the wasting away  and demiseof Tengo's father in rather depressing chapters? Also, the motivations of the more whymsical than sinister Little People aren't  sufficiently cleared. But, all in all, it'a wonderfully rich novel that's also a thriller and an exploration on the nature of reality. And when Tengo and Aomame reunite and gaze at the sky with the one moon, you feel as your reading experience has been worthwhile, after all.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Once again, Clare's writing style is quick to pull me into the story - seriously, like within the first freakin' chapter I was hooked! Of course, following on the heels of City of Bones, it wasn't difficult for me to immerse myself back into Clary's world. The beginning definitely left me reeling when the inquisitor interrogates Jace...ultimate-swoon-worthy Jace. Yeah, I could never be an inquisitor if Jace was the suspect - I'd be way to biased :) . (wipes the drool from my chin)<br /><br />Anyway, the action doesn't stop in this story. We get to meet the fairie court and the snooty, vindictive little fairie queen. There's more werewolves and vampires and other shadowlings!<br /><br />If you enjoyed City of Bones (and I'm sure you did), then you'll fall doubly hard for City of Ashes. The angst, the drama, the action, it's oh so good!<br /><br />Overall rating: 4.5 out of 5 stars<br />Appropriate for ages 14 & up.<br /><br />Fans of Twilight will DEVOUR these books by Clare!
B000OLROWC|2.0|I found this movie extremely slow, unbelievable, and just lame. The only time we actually get to see some karate moves is in the last half hour, but then it was totally unbelievable--this kid learned all that just by painting some fences and waxing some cars? Right... Plus half of the movie was Daniel and Aly flirting or on a date. Lame. More of karate training and less of the girl, this movie would have gotten at least 4 stars from me.
B0084I9QIW|4.0|Not as impressive as the Bucharest concert, but still a good concert and introducing new talent for first time, Cheryl Crow.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Deserves every star I have given it. This book had everything I love about Fantasy. A detailed world that is fleshed out and feels &#34;old&#34;. Intriguing characters that are not always heroic or infallible. This novel truly hit it out of the park for me. As soon as I put it down I wanted the next one (and sadly I had to wait).   While others have mentioned this is a big introduction on what is to come, but don't be fooled by that, it has plenty of plot, pacing is excellent and kept me a awake for hours past my bedtime. This is the type of epic fantasy that I love to read, sweeping story lines, characters that I can get behind and excellent world building and magic system.   When the second novel of this series came out, I re-read this one and was just as enthralled. Finding Fantasy novels like this, ones that grab and hold on long after the last page has been turned has become something of a treasure hunt for me, when I find one, I do mental cartwheels (too old for the real ones anymore).
B004LWZW24|5.0|I like &#34;spooky movies&#34; and this one did not disappoint me.  The one thing we try to shut out of our lives is the paranormal.  Well!  It exists.  Even though this is movie may not be all true, you can not help but believe that somewhere out there in this world, something like this is happening.  This is what scares you!
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|Sat and read this in one go and was completely caught up with the main character and while the setting of the book stays pretty much in one place I never the less felt as if I was on a grand adventure. Just love how Sanderson has always been able to draw me into his writings.
B00BB8Q13A|5.0|It has a great cast and a great story in a fictional retelling of how Shakespeare came to write his greatest tragic romance.  Paltrow won an academy award for her perfomance.
B001L9OKZK|5.0|Never would I have thought I'd be crying over a rabbits named Fiver and Hazel! The story telling that Adams unfolds is amazing, his gift is really an amazing thing, to take as story about such simple creatures as rabbits and breath such life and creating such an interesting tale, truly it is a gift.<br /><br />To make these characters linger in you mind for years and years is rare indeed.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|Chose the game as I'd heard about it.  Not much in the way of how to play or what you do with all the little things that pop up.  Good thing it's free.  I won't bother paying for one.
1594135851|5.0|This takes up where the 1st left off. If you like dystopian novels this is right up your alley. Read it.
B000002HHB|5.0|one of my all time favorite albums. i prefer the songs that weren't big hits. perfect for a sleepy, rainy saturday. River is a great song. But they all are. No need for song skipping on this one.
159413586X|5.0|If you've read the first two by all means read this one.. It ties up all the loose strands and adds a few new ones.
B009LDD54K|5.0|Awesome. Simply Awesome.<br />  Better than we had hoped for.<br />Love the &#34;circa&#34;, great action and old<br />cars. People dressed up for every day<br />things back then and had manners.<br />Great movie series.<br />Thank you so much.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Very good story.  Much better than the movie version, more details.  Reads very well.  I didn't want to put it down.  Nicholas Sparks is a great writer.
B00002DEBW|5.0|This is a phenomenal CD that I've been longing for since albums are no longer practical. I play the hell out of it in my car.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|A girl grows up in the foster care system in the San Francisco Bay Area alienated from  human interaction. Ignorant of how to negotiate the most basic social interactions, she relies on flowers to explain human nature. This story explores what it is to be really alone in the world. She is inevitably drawn to people in her struggle to survive but overwhelmed by memories and their emotions. Retreating to her obsession with flowers and their meanings, she finds the strength and self awareness she needs to begin to truly connect with people.
B00C1S945G|5.0|Shades of Gray, best episode ever. Pulaski! Nothing can compare to Season 2 of STNG. This is the one season on constant rotation into my queue.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This story is so close to the bone. A lovely couple, good people we'd all like to be like, have the marriage we wish we had. They are dedicated parents and successful professionally. The story is told from the perspective of the father. His genuinely happy, enviable life is peeled away in excruciating detail until everything that is precious to him is revealed as delusion. His delusions are terrifyingly familiar.
B008M721MS|2.0|I don't think the engineers of the Skype camera were on the stick when they developed this. I wouldn't want to talk to anyone &#34;face to face&#34;, looking like death warmed over.  :-(
0307476073|3.0|This is a great story but I will not rave on how it is written.  It did not keep my attention to the point that I read it quickly.
B00871C09S|5.0|Anyone who likes movies that tell a story without crashing sounds, blood or blades, car smashes but<br />create characters that are believable will like this movie. Always like the DVDs that have behind the scenes<br />information. reasonable price for repeated enjoyment.
0307279189|5.0|Recommended by a friend at the gym.  He thought I may be interested and said it was life changing for him.  I believe hiim and it was life changing for me.  This is one of the best stories written - could not put the book down.
B0045HCJ9E|5.0|Just terrific entertainment. Cary & Eva & James the best! Classic scenes, Can't say enough, just start your Hicthcock collection.<br />Never need TV again!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Love Will Robie. And Vance. Fast paced but also well-written in good English prose. Baldacci is the best replacement for bad TV I know.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Works well on my no-name android Tablet.  Easy to use & connects seamlessly with Amazon to buy books.  Highly recommended
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|It has been a long time since a book has reeled me in so entirely emotionally.  I did not want this book to end.  This was my first Liane Moriarty book, but won't be my last!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Enjoy is hard to use for a book with the subject.  Yet, I could not put it down.  Lately I feel like YA novels are better written than adult!
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|This is an excellant british drama and they do it so well!! The characters are so ordinary that you are part of the villiage and the plot has you guessing all the time but so intriguing!<br />Well done can't wait for the next season!
B0035HKWLW|5.0|One of Jim Carrey's first movies that I remember watching.  I love his classic &#34;Jim Carrey Style&#34;.  Good family fun!
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|From start to finish, this is an all around good to movie to watch; it contains a very good storyline that will keep you entertained!!!
B00013F38K|4.0|I used to like this series when it was on network TV. This DVD brings back pleasant TV memories! I like it.
0393330435|1.0|I just suffered through the 1st hour of this thing on an audiobook. He seems to think he is the only one in the world who ever accomplished anything. He is a blowhard and egotistical snob. Get over yourself. I thought this would be enjoyable. I will never look at an apple product the same again. Sickening.
B000002UDG|5.0|I like this DVD... it is almost essential for all Beatles fans...especially McCartney fans! The song selection is very good!
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Dave Grohls documentary on the legendary Sound City recording studio. It is a fun historic, 70's through 90's rock journey.<br /><br />I have watched this probably 6 times already. It is very, very good. Fabulous, is all I needed to say.
B005DZMP00|4.0|This is a collection of the Grateful Dead's performances in Europe, in 1972. I like the new version of 'Dark Star' and several other songs on this disc.
B001VFTYW8|3.0|Suspense lacked throughout the book. There has to be more excitement throughout the story. Nothing tied me to the book.
B001SF8G1Q|5.0|This is a CD that I used to have as an LP record when I was in high school. I liked it then and I like it now! It features Bob Dylan in a more relaxed mood.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is the most beautiful story I've read all year. The characters will stay with you long after the story ends.
B0000C23DO|5.0|This is a very good collection of Grateful Dead songs...it is a must for occasional fans! I do like it!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Good read!  Makes you think about what you would do in similar circumstances.  Recommended for any reader who likes great stories!
B00452J5IW|5.0|Of course, the Empire mentioned is not the one in the Star Wars films. This is like a jam session between Jerry Garcia, David Crosby, and members of the Jefferson Airplane!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|historically accurate, beautifully period costumes and sets, and the acting is a pleasure to watch.  Can't wait for Season 4
B004USRKX8|4.0|I used to own this record when it was on LP. I have always liked it...I think that Crosby is about the best singer in folk-rock!
B00EVCD9HY|5.0|Janelle is the electric lady. This album has many gems! Queen, primetime, and dance apocalyptic are particular favorites. Hope to see Janelle live!
B009HUB40Y|3.0|This game is for ages 2- 6 with the new age of games this does not captivate, neither stimulate the adult brain, but then again that is just my opinion.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|this show is formulaic but very well done, great writing & acting, well-developed, balanced characters- love it! Hope the new seasons are as good
B0039TD7PY|5.0|What gifted artist they both are and how sincere they were expressing their appreciation of one another.  Watching this concert was like being there.  I felt there love for each other's work.  This is one of my favorite concerts.  They were both so really engaged while performing.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|I have read most of Kens other books and since his latest doesn't come out until next year (2014) I thought I'd try an older book from him and I'm so glad I did. Loved this book!
B0015AARJI|5.0|I had the need for another controller because i want to play with my friends.<br /><br />It was exactly how i was expecting.<br /><br />Recommended 100% !!!
B00ARF93AQ|4.0|Dredd was a very intense movie full of action. It is not recommended for kids. If you want action and gore, then watch Dredd.
B004UID2LC|4.0|Easy enough to use that I could do it.  Used it to install music videos on my kindle and all went well.
B005LAIIN0|3.0|Movie was ok but it was the type of movie you see once and not again.  I actually dozed during this movie.

B001BR5NN0|5.0|One of the greatest movies from the 1980's.  A must have for every movie fan.  Set the standard for teen flicks.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|google search is good it gives you a great search engine to make it easier to search for things online.
B005LA3Z9M|5.0|Who gets these wonderful ideas and turns them into such an intricate and moving story? I could not put in down. The descriptions of a mother's love were so beautiful and so true and it is not until you become a mother that you can appreciate the unforgiving love of your own and all those before. I don't think I shall buy a bunch of flowers  in future without consulting Victoria's dictionary.... Amazing!
B00B7Y0206|5.0|vTube- viewer & downloader for YouTube (Kindle Tablet Edition)  is a good app to allow you to watch You tube on your Kindle fire when you have access to wi-fi.
B00CJ32S74|4.0|Purchased this soundtrack as mp3 after seeing the movie.<br />Great soundtrack, one of the best recently.<br />My two favorite songs are the ones by The XX (one of my favorite groups, more popular in the UK, but I am sure they will get there in the U.S.) and the song by Nero.<br />The missing song, and reason for 4 stars, is from the first time the main character in the movie goes to a party.  It's a very good beat with the lyrics \\"I can't stop\\".<br />Consequently, the song is called \\"I can't stop\\" by Flux Pavilion.<br />There are two worthwhile versions that can be downloaded individually here on Amazon.<br />I Can't Stop & I Still Can't Stop<br />Hope this helps someone out.<br />Cheers,<br />Blake
B000VWGYHU|5.0|Eminem is a great music artist. I greatly enjoy listening to all his songs and own all his cd's wether on cd or on MP3 format.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Ssooo intense a lot of unexpected things. Character came and went arguments were sooo intense. Shocking season MUST WATCH! !!!

B008220C38|3.0|A perfect pair to draw to, or so I thought, after seeing their interpretation of Pride and Prejudice that worked so well! But, Joe Wright got too &#34;artsy&#34; in this interpretation and the &#34;stages presence&#34; actually detracts from this classic tale. Not bad, and, not good. Should have just let the story and superb acting carry it. Would have worked much better
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|This cable only lasted a week or two and didn't work anymore glad i didn't pay a lot for it
B00EAH3EQG|5.0|All I can really say is how much I love this cd.  I mean, I really liked her debut cd Perfectionist which was more club oriented, but this one absolutely blows me away.  It is an extremely personal album and she does not shy away from difficulties that she has had.  I cannot say which are my favorite songs as they are all exceptional, but standouts for me are Marlboro Lights, Trouble, Saturday Night, Problem and Devils Don't Fly.  Give this a listen, I promise you will not be disappointed. She deserves to be a global superstar!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I Love this show!  The writing is phenomenal and the plot twists are ever surprising.  Um truly enjoying this series.
B00E3D7WGU|5.0|Finally, a FULL LIVE Madonna album, and it sounds incredible on my bose surround sound system.  It brought me back to that night in Atlanta, what a great show it was.  I really like the waltz version she did of Like A Virgin.  It took that song from a silly, carefree song of immaturity to the realization of a grown, mature woman expressing how a new love makes her feel.  It was achingly haunting and brilliant. This show starts dark and ends in celebration, a journey through the bad times (her divorce, she was a little angry if you couldn't tell)), to the joys and triumphs of her healing.  A brilliant show in my opinion.  I read people complaining about the sound.  In reality, there is no problem.  This sounds like a live concert and this is how it sounded at the show.  The first section is heavily auto tuned, but that is the sound of the songs.  She is not lip syncing, she has a microphone that alters the voice, you know the kind that makes everyone able to sound like Britney.  Just sayin.  If you are a Madonna fan, GET this live cd and dance and sing get up and do your thing!
B00F91RYL8|1.0|Just not feeling it. it was a plague to get through it... save your money on this one... Go rent a classic movie instead
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Ok game I feel that it could have better and more realistic features that a horse would have. But it is an ok game
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is pornography, not literature, and is disgusting. I am amazed that Amazon.com would sell something like this on line.
1612191290|5.0|To a lay reader like me , the concept Debt from its origin in ancient world to its modern forms lucidly brought out by David Graeber.<br />An anthropologist take on the financial world provides for extremely interesting reading and also provides deep insights into our Psyche.<br /><br />Debt - The First 5,000 years provides a new perspective of Debt in out financially troubled modern times.
B000SEFNMS|3.0|Descriptions were good and the sense of suspense as well.  I really did not think the author's digression into his own experience as a youth added anything to the story.
B00BHUB11Y|5.0|My 2 year old loves it, and so do I.  I thought she would get scared, but she's definitely not afraid of monsters.
1416972250|5.0|Don't read this one without first reading the first 2! It's so good! I read all the books that have been released in paperback and I just can't wait for the next 2!
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Have read all 3 of Gillian Flynn's books. I liked this one third of all 3. I loved the twisted ending, but didn't like the reporter character.  She was too strange to really identify with.
1416955070|5.0|I am in love with this series! If you are a fan of the supernatural you will love it too!
B0027MJU00|5.0|Liked this one second to gone girl, but more than sharp objects. Characters were interesting and enough twists and turns. I thought the ending was a little hard to believe, but fast reading book overall.
B008469DGY|5.0|You can play this Golf game anywhere at anytime and its always fun no matter where your at! I give it a A++++++++++++++++
B005USZML4|5.0|John Grisham has successfully tricked me in the course of the story, just like how Sir Doyle does. Certainly a good book to read.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Best note program ever. I use it simultaneously on five machines! Works flawlessly and is completely flexible. Couldn't recommend it more.
B005USZYDU|5.0|John Grisham has the ability to make the reader have an undivisible attention. His books certainly are one of the best in the field of detective fiction~
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I could do without the cartoons and monotonous music (which can be turned off) but I love the complexity of the game.
B0074VTHKM|5.0|I just cannot put the book down. It has hooked me page 1 and still going. John Grisham sure has his methods. Thank him for a good book~
B0089EHWQE|5.0|During a summer of heavy reading, along came this little book (recommended by a friend) and it blew me away.  A novel, but full of thought-provoking questions we hope we never have to answer for ourselves or our loved ones.  Entertaining, insightful and REAL.  This was the first book I've read by Ms. Noyes and I'm ready to start another.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Buying credits game charges for them then freezes and you don't receive your credits that you were charged for.<br />Thank you
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Where do I begin with why I loved Tangled?  I love the style of the graphics in this movie.  I love the personalities of the characters; they are so vivid!  I love the music in the movie as well.  And I love the story-line they used in adapting the Rapunzel fable.  My children are all grown up but I will still be buying this movie.
B00F91SCXC|5.0|the movie was amazing the suspense was very interesting and kept me at the edge of my seat. I loved it
B0000C23DO|5.0|i loved it alot. i got this for my boyfriend he loves this cd.....i will be ording more cd from you thank you very much...

B008OOYALE|5.0|I reallylike this game. It's not hard and the coins to prices ratio isnt bad. I like how you can get on luke once a day and do what you need like breed some dragons or plant stuff then get on the next day and everythings ready and you can do more. And i really like how you get money from your dragons. Thats really helpful when you first start the game. Overall I think this game is definitely worth whatever you pay for it.
B00BT70J7M|5.0|Is there anything else to be said about Mr.Kaufmann's artistry!!!???This cd is one of the most incredible cd's ever recorded!!Anyone who doesn't like this cd should give up opera and go listen to some idiotic person like Miley Cyrus.This is just absolutely stunning.Every single aria!!!!Totally beside myself.After listening and studying this music for 45yrs to come across such a young and dignified artist like this is incredible!!I'm glad to have lived to hear and watch him on stage.It seems like now he's going to be better as if that was possible!!THANK YOU JONAS KAUFMANN!!!YOU THE MAN!!!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I can't get out of room 10, help!! I don't know what to do with those number dials under the desk! And how to get that key out of the glass box in the vent!
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|This movie is awesome. It is a little more deeper in to Tony's persona. Pepper wears the suit. Happy survives. It would be cool if some Avenger characters would show up and beat some A.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|really fun and addicting. I cant stop playing. it and my sister loves the game and she is pony five and shes in kindergarten!
B000P0J0D8|5.0|terreffic action film great cast of characters many stars RIP dennis weaver real life believe it and as 2 the movie start 2 end it is a great high interest movie start 2 finish
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is a fun and challenging game for all ages. I highly recommend this game to anyone needing to kill some time
B00004Y87O|5.0|just listening 2 the opening theme gave me goose bumps john carpenter wrote the score opening movie and the music put you in a futuristic state and it delivered excellent action kurts best
B00CRWJ7VC|4.0|Would like to see it more than once to understand the messages.<br />Certainly entertaining with a little something for everyone & delightful tips-of-the-hat to Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Matrix, etc.<br />Hilarious & superb performances by Jim Broadbent.<br />Frustrating part was having to strain to understand the dialog (a pigeony-English?) between Halle Berry & Tom Hanks in the futuristic world scenes, but it wouldn't stop me from it watching again.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|If you are an old fan or a new fan to the Eagles, you will love watching this DVD...It's informing, entertaining and you also get a DVD of<br />the Hotel California concert...I've watched all 3 dvds 2x already...starts from the Eagles beginning to where they are today...The DVD of the concert plays Randy Meisan singing Take it to the Limit...don't miss that one...and Felder with Hotel California....You will not be sorry getting this DVD set.
B008ER9QLK|5.0|This is the first full length recording of the Ring Cycle that I know of that provides HD video and digital sound quality.  The difference is stunning, even with the relatively minimalist Metropolitan sets.  After paying thousands to see another Ring production live in Seattle, I can now repeatedly enjoy this similarly excellent recording for a few dollars.
B00BH0VSM6|3.0|Interesting in many respects, especially the Australian setting and some of the Australian characters.  The main character, flawed but trying to make his life work, has lived through such a horror story one wonders how he can maintain any grasp on normalcy.  I think I'd read another one or two of the series to see how he's been developed or continues to be.
B003G4W49C|5.0|It's been a long time since I've had the motivation to finish a book. This book made it impossible not to.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Awesome Blu ray series.  Would recommend this to any die hard Star Wars fan.  Its a must have for movie fans!!!!
B003F3NEBG|4.0|Love this Blu-Ray disc version with Keira Knightley. The disc had some black out seconds. That's why I'm not giving it 5 stars.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I love historical fiction, so I do have to start by saying that. I love sweeping sagas and so did everyone in my book club. We got to know a lot of characters very well. Even though it was long, it was worth it, if you like that kind of thing. One thing I did notice was that it took a little longer to get into this story than the first book, but once I did, I loved it!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|installation couldn't have been easier. Downloaded the software so I'd be ready for it as it joined my home network, resulting in a very quick, simple install. Worked immediately, Can now watch my Netflix stream on my flat screen with subtitles and have been going nuts with it!! Can't wait for more channels to be added to it. Not really interested in You Tube access for my big screen, but may try that out at some point. Great idea and execution.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Item came before expected.  Very happy with CD and have been enjoying it every since.  I would order again. Plus Michael Buble is a class act.  His Christmas CD last Christmas is really SPECIAL!!
B000GCFY0I|5.0|Genius. So intriguing- the sense of mystery, the concept, the story was so engaging. It was fluffy and unpredictable at the same time.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is beautifully written and truthful. I got so into the story that it only took me a few hours to read it, and trust me,I'm not easy to impress. Hats off to Stephen Chbosky. :)
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|This movie is hilarious in about six different directions.  Great performances by all and the plot line just keeps ramping up to the unexpected conclusion.
B005D4YOHI|4.0|These sandals have been awesome this summer!  I do a decent amount of kayaking and these are perfect for getting in and out of the water.  By the way, I couldn't find them anywhere any cheaper than on Amazon.  The only issue with them for me is the arch.  They have a decent arch but mine is a little higher.  That's the only reason I rate them a 4 instead of a 5.  If you are looking for a good quality waterproof sandal, you've found it!
B00B2V66VS|2.0|Unreal...I was Lvl 8 almost Lvl 9 but I exit the game to do something and when I got back everything reset!! I'm pissed off &gt;=C
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I'm probably a little biased as I love basically anything google makes but I like it so much that I went out and bought another one for our bedroom, its really hand and works really well. I would recommend that anyone that gets one of these though would also use the web player with plex.
B0078X2LKY|4.0|Fun book to read.  Need twenty words or it wont let us read it any more.  And we want to.
B00BQ1DARM|5.0|Jesse Ware is basically the intelligent music lovers Adele, she is so creative with her lyrics and her voice is amazing. I absolutely love her song Wildest Moments.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|Such a sweet and light story!  Emma is so naive and charming and a perfect actress for the character--as are all but one (in my opinion) of the other actors/actresses.  Jane Austen is a great author and I personally like this as well as Pride and Prejudice....though a more simple story for sure.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Love this book. The Mortal Instruments series just keeps getting better and better. Plus, Jace's and Clary's story line just has me hooked.
B0037B6QSY|5.0|This is a lovely book.  If you are thinking about being \\"present,\\" and want a well written, easy to read resource, this is the book for you. He writes beautifully, gives you other resources and authors to check out along the way, and tells personal stories which will leave you thinking.<br /><br />He does not try to impose a formal meditation practice, though tapes are available if you choose to purchase them to guide you through meditation sessions.  Instead, he talks abut \\" breath\\" and about making your \\"practice\\" an integral part of your everyday life.<br /><br />So, it's about options, and your choices.  Well worth reading!<br /><br />This is a book that I will read many times.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This review is written by Katie: This is one of my favorite shows. It is so well put together.  I find myself thinking about it long after I have watched an episode.
055358202X|3.0|George R.R. Martin was a talented writer who created a wonderful trilogy that turned into a quintlogy or an octilogy that will never be finished by it's originator.  It is now in the hands of a MEGACORP. Accept it as the unfinished work of art it is.  They will turn it into a Star Trek type franchise. George R.R. Martin you let beauty turn into gold in your hands! It is worth reading up to this point cause it is wonderful.  Beyond here... you may judge...this is where I choose to stop.  Do your worst MEGACORP!
B004EF8AJA|5.0|This review is written by Katie: I really loved this movie. I had no idea what it was about before I watched it and was compelled to watch all three episodes one right after the other.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|the movie promises to be very good in terms of fast paced action epic drama.  It has a bit of that but the movie needs to end within a given timeline.  the sequence following the initial city-wide outbreak tends to be confined to help solving situation of one individual & its family. Unfortunately this narrow down aspect of the film seems a bit of a rush (looking for an ending) that ;IMO, takes away the explosive climax that one would like to see from any large-screen hit considering the good effect caused by Z -related action drama seen from the likes of the very good &#34;Walking Dead&#34;
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|Does exactly what one would would expect. Unusual in this day and time.saves a lot of time having this at your fingertips.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Can't wait to go to next book.  I enjoy the way she brings the people and their circumstances to life.  Very vivid.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Love this app!  Very happy being able to look up weather across the country in seconds!  Love the video features too!
B00E0SX118|5.0|Watched this at the theatre with the grandkids and we loved it then.  Watched it again tonight after purchasing it, and it made us laugh just as much.  Great watching their first experience with fire.  Timeless story of fathers and daughters, and the family unit.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I love this game i this it will be a great experience for a young adolescent mind becase it teaches the value of money the price of property cost of living organisms .
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|Tricky and intriguing. Lots of fun. I like hunt and find games and this is a great mind bender. And lots of fun.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|It rocks!  A fun , thrilling , action packed movie. Karl Urban is THE perfect Judge Dredd !  Rent it or buy it. But you just gotta see it !
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|Best zombie movie in years. I hope all horror movies that come out use this as the guideline. Brad Pitt really did a great job with this movie.
B000OVLINI|5.0|This was, to me, one of those rare, enchanting, compelling, and page-turning books.  The intertwining of characters and events was done brilliantly and totally kept my attention and enjoyment at all times.  I am looking forward reading his other novels.
B007PVHMCG|4.0|My son loves mine craft and lo e lego, so Lego mine craft is perfect. Eu indico para quem tem filhos que adora os dois
B00BKQT5RC|5.0|This watch is awesome. I upgraded from the Timex Weekender and I'm really happy with the way the Daniel Wellington watch looks and feels. The face is very clean and classic. The leather band looks and also feels great. I plan on buying a couple of the nylon straps. Worth it, I say.
B005F2BBLK|1.0|It wasn't very good. And we had a problem with the video buffering so that made it hard to watch
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Awesome!! Excellent levels of action and figures of Star Wars characters.<br />Very interesting areas of conflict in space and in the water
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Good movie. I'm not very familiar with the lote surrounding Dredd and his characters. However this was a pretty good portrayal of a good character faced with hard reality, doing his best to remain uncompromised.
193700788X|1.0|Like many others here I cannot believe the disservice Ms. Harris did to her readers with this book. Many others have already skewered it in detail so I'll not but just had to rate the book because I'm so disappointed by this miserable excuse for a final novel in the series.
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|Just exactly what we wanted......this type of music, blues, is not always to find in stores, especially in Iowa...reasonable too
B004IYISSK|1.0|Probably one of the most disjointed books I have ever read.  A tot al waste of my time, ready only becausae it was a selection of my book club friends.
B005USZYDU|2.0|Good fun read but a lousy ending. First time Grisham let me down. Hopefully the last. May read another in the series to determine if this is a fluke.
B008Y74B10|5.0|Like many, I thought I had a fair understanding of the boom, bust, and crash that happened in the real estate and credit markets. I was wrong. The extent of corruption and criminal behavior was far beyond anything I would have expected. It's infuriating that these people who fleeced America have not been hauled off like the petty criminals they are. Moreover, many are still at it or are now working at a federal level.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Stayed up until all hours of the night because I HAD to know what happened!  Love that the characters are flawed and believable.
B001EOOQEM|4.0|I really liked this album, the Dio's voice is and will always be epic. The combination of this quality of musicians is amazing.
B003Y5H5AG|5.0|I loved this movie. The animation was great, amazing that the actors come through the animation. Great for the whole family.
B000002H33|5.0|One of the best album of Metallica, it's classic music for metalheads. This album worth 5 stars or more. It's METALLICA.
B003DNN0L2|5.0|This movie is clever, and entertaining. I love it. Great for kids or adults. Wes Anderson is my favorite director.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Black Sabbath Do It Againg... This Album it's so amazing, Tony, Ozzy and Geezer made music so awesome and great.
B003MC5N28|5.0|Very dark for a elementary age reading (I remember friends of mine reading this in the 4th grade).  I found The Giver really sticks with you.  Lowry is clearly a great writer.  Highly recommended!
B000002H6C|5.0|Classial music for metalheads, One of the master pieces of Metallica, nothing more to add, if you like Metallica you should buy this album.
B0047Y17P2|4.0|Love the Mickey Haller stories and this one won't let you down. Exciting, clever story based on current events and technology. You'll enjoy it, buy it now.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|One of my favorites album of Megadeth, all the songs are amazing. The music is so great. It's classical music for metalheads.
B003VANOFY|2.0|Let me start this off by saying that I have owned the G930 for just over 2 years and ordered it from Logitech directly.  I had to RMA it three times.  My first one lasted roughly 1.5 years, before the side buttons stopped working.  My next had connection issues, and so did the next.  Finally I got my last set and it still had the connection issue, even though I tried different drivers, locations, and computers (as well as other troublesome things).  I got sick of them and am now out of warranty, so I bought Sennheiser PC 360's and I must say the sound quality of the 360's defeats my old G930's but to be fair they are twice the price...  I wish Logitech made a quality product, instead of hit or miss, as I shouldn't need a new headset after two short years with such a high price.
B001CISHU4|5.0|My favorite album of Amon Amarth, it's very good, the songs, the sound, everything. The music es very strong and great.
0812982622|5.0|This is probably the most fascinating book I've ever read. Extremely well written, amazing story, and a &#34;must read&#34; for anyone who cares about the world around her/him.
B00008OWZC|5.0|Led Zeppelin live is awesome, i love this edition. Required purchase for fans and collectors, Led Zeppelin it's the greatest band in the world.
B00EB6F1TY|3.0|Definitely could have been better at better movie.  The mental story of Tony Stark aside, the story was jumping all around.  This movie just did not have the story flow that the previous stories had.
B001UREJWM|5.0|The combination of Tony and Dio is simply amazing. Very good production, and i love the awesome cover. Dio's voice is Epic.
B00821OX98|5.0|Awesome Series.  Well written....  I suggest you watch it....  Just gets better and better as each episode moves the story line forward...
B0002XDODU|5.0|My favorite album of the band, all the songs are awesome. It's very good music. I recommend buying this album.
B006UW4OB8|5.0|I was uncertain about giving up the viewer version on my KF HD when I read about needing a connection for the full version to work in two of the reviews.<br /><br />I have used this product on other devices for a number of years and found it to be the best for many reasons.<br /><br />I sometimes need information in the wallet when I am away from WFi and that was a deal breaker for me.<br /><br />I finally bought it and found the information does not appear to be correct.<br /><br />I loaded the app, setup wireless sync and did a sync with the PC. I next turned off WiFi and opened the Kindle eWallet. It opened just fine.<br /><br />I am very happy to once again be able to edit and sync from both devices.
B000VWYNNW|5.0|One of the two official live albums of Led Zeppelin, is required to have for any fan of the band.
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|No secret I have three words, I LOVE IT!!<br />Greatest one of all & I workout a lot!!!<br />Is is a KEEPER! 😎Must have....
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I am so elated to have have this cable.  It iis no comparison to the original cable cordf that came with the kindle.  It works great. Thanks Amazon!
B00F91H666|3.0|I like the Plot but there are to many inconsistencies in the movie.  I nit pick movies instead of just enjoying them.
B00F35B8F8|5.0|I'm not a purist or a Trekkie, but I have seen all 12 of the movies and most of the tv shows thanks to my kids. I really liked this movie and its predecessor mostly because of Chris Pine, who is a great Kirk, but also because it's nice to see the story in a modern, current format as opposed to the dated versions we've been watching for years. Fun and entertaining.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|I love a fast paced movie that keeps you guessing! The characters are believable and I love Morgan Freeman's role. If you are like me, you don't want to know the ending before you get there. Its a fun time for movie fans!
B00499NHLC|5.0|Started watching because honestly I couldn't find anything else on Prime and I liked Benedict Cumberbatch in Star Trek. What a wonderful surprise. The show is very well-written, so clever and interesting, and Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are terrific. Great show.
0061336459|1.0|Not only did I find this book disappointing, but I also found it disturbing.  Mr.Eker's ego is completely out of control; the title of this book should be &#34;T. Harv Eker, the Most Awesome Person in the World, Ever.&#34;  It is replete with unabashed self-promotion and hubris to the point that after 30 pages I was disgusted with the book and could not continue.<br /><br />If you respond well to tactless bragging such as &#34;Some people tell me I have the 'Midas Touch', where everything I get involved with turns to gold.  They're right...&#34; (pg. 7), or one of the endless plugs for his seminars such as this beauty on page 28 &#34;As usual, people were filing up to the stage, one by one, to get an autograph and say hello or thank you or whatever&#34; then this book is for you.  I, however, found much of the writing delusional and/or extremely shallow.<br /><br />And the clich&eacute;d platitudes!  Never ending...&#34;Roots create the Fruits&#34; (pg.12) or &#34;the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree&#34; (pg.26)!!!  Seriously???  These sayings made it into a book published after 1900 !?!? Save yourself a few dollars and just listen to your grandparents old sayings and that will cover the material in this book, and some.
B009DH372Y|5.0|A GREAT DVD to remember this influential band. No problems with sound or picture quality. The extras on this DVD are wonderful to watch.
B005CMSDLE|2.0|This movie is a typical action movie, with obvious plot-holes and it requires you to suspend your disbelief a great deal. If you don't mind doing that, go right ahead and buy it. I can't see ever watching this a second time around. While it was visually pretty, it was hard to care about the movie after a while. I'd say skip it. Rent it if you must, don't buy it.
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|Watched this movie again after several years and still enjoy it.  Classic gangster movie.  Although still amuses me that Robert Dinero and Ray Liotta play Irish characters.  A great Saturday night watch.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|ok game but it kept freezing my kindle, had to reset it too many times so i had to remove it.
B007D2XSW0|2.0|I have this app on the Galaxy SIII. The editing features are great but photos will not save once edited. I have more than adequate room on my device to save the files, but the app freezes whenever I selected save. If pictures would actually save I'd give it 5 stars.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I like it but it wouldn't load. So it mad me really mad. I ordered it 2 days ago and still hasn't loaded
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Great psychological thriller!  Couldn't wait to see how it ended!  Enjoyed the suspense while reading!  This writer has an incredible imagination!
B00785P2QC|5.0|It is so cool<br />You can create your own city and collect money and sell products it is so cool .I really like this games
034580404X|5.0|WOW!!!!!most amazing books ever. I am so glad I read them changing my life helping save my marriage.  Can't wait for the movies they better be as good as the books.
B00EQ0CKRQ|3.0|Very well made. I like it better than asphalt 7. But they make it nearly impossible for you to get past the 4th season without spending actual money to get game money to buy better cars. They cost anywhere from 50,000 to 500,000 and you get about 2,000 a race. After you buy about 5 cars you find yourself with no game money at all.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Just fun to watch. Lots of fun to watch with other people at home or any where - that is all!
B007SGM084|5.0|Love the book, can't wait for the movie,  and to think it only got around only by voice go figure.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Great book. Daughter enjoyed reading. Will be buying the others in the series. She can't wait to read the others.
0399160450|5.0|Have been reading clancy for a long time. never get tired of reading his novels. always entertaining and hold your interest
1608871517|5.0|If you're fascinated by the creative process - you will love this book. Regardless of whether you're an MJ fan or not. Because through reading this book you really understand how the man, the artist and the muse were one. I had high expectations of this book and reading it exceeded them. Bush provides a beautifully vivid account of his 20+ years designing for Michael. Through it you see how Michael cajoled, teased and pushed Bush to nurture his creativity, invent clothes that had never been thought of before and chase an idea from the vintage shops of London to ancient Egypt. The pictures are gorgeous, the costumes are stunning in the only way that MJ costumes are stunning. And the stories of Michael are fascinating - giving a real insight into his prankster personality, his belief in people's talent, and his tireless quest to innovate and to create. The things that he'd observe, the details that he'd play with to test whether his audiences were paying attention, the way that he'd set creative riddles for Bush to solve, and the small and large acts of generosity combine to give a richly detailed picture of a man who was a creative genius, a loyal friend and a uniquely sensitive humanitarian who truly cared about the people and world around him.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is as close as you can get to owning a horse in real life without actually owning one I would recommend this to anyone 10/10
B00BKTFABE|1.0|As soon as I downloaded the app and tried to take my first video, the 'camera stopped.' So, I deleted it and and reinstalled it...still no luck. Very disappointed in Kindle Fire. I shouldn't have to find a decent app just to take pictures and videos, should be standard.
B003U6BE8I|1.0|Seriously wish I'd spared myself the pain and trauma of having watched this monstrosity. Save yourself! Save yourself!!!! Run away!!!!
1781162646|5.0|I got the audio book from the library not knowing anything about it.  I enjoy Stephen King but had heard nothing at all about this book.  WOW all I can say is I loved it, it might have been I was going through some of the same things as Devon was, hell I'm 50 just goes to show unrequited love knows no age.  But the characters were alive the story was intriguing and poignient.  Its said that the editor of the book cried at the end, well so did I.  read it and enjoy it.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I had missed a few of the Season Eight shows so I caught up on Amazon!!!!<br />Would love to own all 8 seasons! Cant wait for Season 9 to start!
B00C061I3K|1.0|After hearing the track Get Lucky on Colbert I bought this CD hoping for more dance cuts like it.  It's a great tune, well crafted lyrics and music but the only decent one on the CD.  The other tracks range from embarrassing voiceovers to Alan Parsons derived techno, all with lots of electronically processed voice.  Just download the Get Lucky track and save some money.
B002FRNCG0|5.0|These guys may be young, but they certainly have a lot of talent. I really enjoy their sound and music.
B00F91RYL8|2.0|I was hoping for a better story, but not a great movie.  Hollywood ran out of imagination on this one.
B002SEW5WW|5.0|I love these guys and this was a great addition to my ever growing cd collection.  some great music indeed
B001ROZIA0|3.0|A good movie if you need something to make you laugh and entertain you.  I enjoy watching it.  x x
B005FITIF0|4.0|It was an OK movie....but I bought the DVD because there were scenes shot inside my brothers house in Detroit.
B000063V8T|5.0|It was and is still in my collection and I watch them from time to time and still happy with the purchase!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This book is so touching and raw. I breezed through this amazing adventure and learned so much about life and myself. What an awesome read, & as most of Albom`s books do, it will change your life (or at the very least your perspective on time;)!
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|After the intrigue of season one I found myself thinking that Game of Thrones can't possibly top it, especially considering the death of a very key and popular character (avoiding spoilers for newcomers here).  But with the evolution of Daenerys, the twisted power struggle in the Lannister family, the manipulation of Littlefinger and the eunich, and a finale that blew me away with a surprise from the cold, I could not look away.  I watched these straight through in one weekend.<br /><br />One thing will never change.  Romero will always kill off characters, no matter how influential they are in the story.  I love that blatant disregard for convention and it provides the ultimate drama.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Good game.my granddaughter played it and wants it on her kindle fire tablet. .colorful, lots of pretty graphics. Several levels.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Season one hooked me immediately and did not let go.  The characters are so deep that anybody watching will connect to at least one of them.  It happens with everybody I've met that's watched the show.  The grit of the battlefield, the backstabbing, the drama, the lust, the show brings pure power.<br /><br />One thing will never change.  Romero will always kill off characters, no matter how influential they are in the story.  I love that blatant disregard for convention and it provides the ultimate drama.
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|I expected the graphic quality / resolution to be very clear since its in HD, but notice many pixelation like a boot leg? Otherwise the stream was seamless no problems there. Storywise? I still expected better.
B009LDCZDC|5.0|saw homeland 1 and will wait until winter to get into this.  this series is a bit gritty, but intriguing so i have to be in the correct mood to not see the evil so pronounced and just enjoy the twists and turns of the series.
B00ESY77LO|4.0|Last 4 lines are the most important part of the movie, it explains gaspys theory that the past can be repeated ......... Or not.
B00ALCBU4M|5.0|we first rented this from netflix.  good place to screen movies.  it was so good that we then purchased it.  the story keeps one very engaged and is another learning experience of unknown facts during the end of WWII
B0066WJLU6|4.0|I like it. It serves it purpose well. I does what I need it to do when i need it to work. In the end, it is just a flashlight
B00915G6R6|5.0|we are half way through it now.  we love the series.  because we hate commercials on the shows we like we wait for the seriies to come on DVD and then watch it straight through. this season so far there are some unexpected turns that have livened it up from season 3.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is super fun, addictive game. I love the minions. Be sure to get the instructions when they offer them because if you don't you will not know how to control you minion. We have a lot of fun with this one
B00BDSRER0|5.0|I can't stop listening to it. In my opinion, one of the best records of 2013 thus far. And for those who insist in comparing it to Wolfgang, let me say that its pointless. Real artists and true creativity are always innovating, searching for the new. And new this is.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|this is a really fun movie. Joss Whedon has done a great job revamping Star Trek. Benedict Cumberbatch is fantastic as Khan. And those were some pretty big shoes to fill.
B00DJYK9ZU|5.0|I've heard the additional tracks in concert and they are a great addition to the original album. Great music from great people. Would love to hear more from Neyla.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|It is so watchable and entertaining. However my day was if it ends by watching Doctor Who it is a good day. It is almost to be kept as a remedy for bad days.
0763660531|5.0|The illustrations are beautiful and interesting and the story is imaginative. Both my two-year-old and five-year-old love it. I find picture books without words to be great for discussion and for language development for young children. Can't wait to see what the author/illustrator comes out with next.
159102594X|5.0|As the cover blurb says, the characters are the most &#34;realistic&#34; you are likely to find in a fantasy novel.  I wish there was more in that universe.
0763644765|5.0|My two-year-old loves this book and requests for it to be read all the time. I like the positive, empowering spin it puts on potty training.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|The Shania Twain Greatest Hits CDs is a great collection of some of her best songs.  It's upbeat and will get you to sing along.
B0002XMKYE|5.0|I liked this movie very much.  I am going to purchase the next movie on Patton,  His Final Years.  You will not be disappointed with this purchase.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|This movie was fast paced for sure. Brad Pitt did a good job. It was not a well put together movie and left me poorly informed and dissatisfied
B008UX2UIO|4.0|Reading this book, classic though it is, is like watching an episode of \\"Honey Boo Boo...\\" Funny but sad. Sad, sad, sad...<br /><br />While there may not be people exactly like the characters described herein, there are enough people like them that we feel for them and the lives they lead.<br /><br />While we laugh and chuckle at Toole's words and descriptions there is a touch of grief. Why should we find humor and escape in the pathos of other people's lives?  It's  like laughing when someone takes a bad fall. It may look funny and it may be funny, but there could be serious injury in that fall. And we some how find that funny!!!<br /><br />Having said that, this is an enjoyable book.  I could not read it without thinking about W.C. Fields playing the part of Ignatius Reilly.  His voice and personna can be sensed and felt again and again as Ignaciouis goes from adventure to adventure, from foilable to foilable,  carrying much of New Orleans with him as he goes.<br /><br />Exaggerated characters perhaps, but too close to the pathos of some people's lives to feel total humor.  Yet, we can't help but laugh.<br /><br />We are, afterall, human.<br /><br />Honey Boo Boo set in New Orleans.<br /><br />If you like Honey Boo Boo, you will love this book.<br /><br />If you cringe at Honey Boo Boo, you will cringe here as well...
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|It was exactly what I wanted, really enjoyed it.  Delivered quickly and works great.  this is a great series and I missed season 3 when it aired
B00C3UUZVE|5.0|Belly laugh from grand kids<br />all grand parents should have this on hand and a full charge on the kindle fire
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Amazing just an amazing book...if you have doubts then I'll just tell you now read it..it's a must read kind of book
B005XUC398|4.0|It was a bit different and held my interest, but I didn't care for the ending. Some movies I can watch a second time, but not this one.
0385528787|5.0|First of all, having been several years since the last book, I must commend Atwood for her prologue which nicely sums the first two books up for the reader before we delve into book three of the trilogy. I vote all books do this in series from here on out, yes?<br /><br />This last book does a nice job in bringing the two \\"parallel universes\\" so to speak, back together again, connecting the remaining \\"survivors\\" and doing a sort of cultural clash with the Crakes and Snowman followers of the world to sum it up.<br /><br />A great post-apocalyptic series overall and an amazing end to an amazing series, highly recommended!
B00942Y4IY|5.0|My title says it all!  Action packed adventure set on another planet light years away.  Excellent acting throughout.  If you haven't seen it, it's worth watching.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app. I really think its better than temple run,and i would buy this game if i were you.
B0089OBLDO|1.0|I bought this to use my ps3 controller with xbox for ultimate marvel vs. capcom tournaments.<br /><br />Pros:<br />N/A<br /><br />Cons:<br />You need a xbox controller to power it on....Retarded.<br />During matches it activates the xbox live menu randomly but consistently which can be a major problem in tournaments. It isn't defective, I've seen others in person that do the same.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend it for this use. Maybe it works for other uses. $13 down the drain.
B0013KTGAG|4.0|Great soundtrack, enjoyable movie. Nice and sci-fi. People judge too much nowadays, especially with sci-fi. Just go into it with no expectations and it will be good! I highly recommend downloading the soundtrack, it's amazing to sleep to.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|I love this app because I can access Amazon anytime I want it. I've looked up items during lunch out or while shopping. It's very helpful to be able to compare items and prices.
B00181JGI2|5.0|Best movie ever. Over the line. The rug really tied the room together did it not? You said it man
B00881PTRC|3.0|I liked this game for a while. Hangman is Hangman. I don't find myself playing it a lot but it's okay.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|All right, first thing's first, if you're on the fence about buying this version of Asphalt, if it's because you don't know if it's gonna be a good game, or if you might need to pay unnecessary fees and stuff like that, DON'T HESITATE! I'm making myself clear when I say this, it is MUCH better than Asphalt 7. Why?<br /><br />&middot; Better steering controls<br />&middot; Tracks are longer<br />&middot; Song/Music options<br />&middot;More and better cars to chose from<br />&middot;More racing options/Diff. ways to race<br />&middot; More places to race<br />&middot; Better graphics<br />&middot; Online AND Local multiplayer<br />&middot; AND MUCH MORE!<br /><br />All in all, I would highly recomend getting this over Asphalt 7<br />(P.S. no random fees included, and in my eyes, its a phenomenal game, best in the market! nothing else can beat it!)
B00AR83PN4|4.0|I really like this game; it's very pretty and colorful. I'm always trying to beat my last score. Love it!

B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|The writing was good but I felt rather oppressed by the families involved  .  The interactions, repercussions, deceit and tragedies  made it a difficult read for me, though the understanding of human nature was superb.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|Park & Eleanor successfully transports you back to the days of twirling the telephone cord around your finger while talking on the phone, keeping your voice down because it would be just tragic if your parents heard you talking about anything and everything unimportant and epic, with that person that that caused butterflies to take flight in you. First love, oblivious parents, friendship, growing up, and a shitty home life are all handled delicately and with humor in a way that leaves you both crying and laughing when it all comes to an end. If you don't read this book, you'll never know the nostalgia overload to be had between these pages. Eleanor & Park is a sarcastic, smart, realistic, and fresh take on the age old story of star-crossed soul mates. You'll devour it. And love every second.

B00E5N8DGG|5.0|I was present for two of the live shows that became a part of this film.  The show is broken into two sets.  The first part contains the entire 12-track Hysteria album played in original track order.  The second part is a set of fan favorites and rarely played songs.  In person, the quality of the show was beyond compare.  If the blu-ray captures half the energy of the actual event it will be more than worth the money.  This was an amazing event.  Definitely collection worthy!
B00F35BV64|5.0|Awesome. Great second movie most sequels aren't that great but this was epic. It's a must own an awesome addition to any movie collectors collection
1475255586|5.0|I teach ESL to adults for two hours a night. This book has great ideas for games to liven up the group when they begin to feel tired. I also teach primary age kids for half an hour each morning and they love knowing that there will be a game with every lesson. This is a wonderful resource for people like me who aren't very creative. There are so many good ideas that can be adapted to meet the needs of each lesson.
140006922X|5.0|The premise behind Zealot is that we can flesh out the minimal historical account of the life of Jesus of Nazareth by understanding the religious and political context in which he lived. To a large degree it succeeds, but this can also be read simply as a fascinating account of that place and time 2000 years ago.<br /><br />Aslan paints a rich picture of the Roman occupation of first century Palestine, outlining the intertwined religious and political influences on the average and not-so-average Jews. This has profound consequences on how the society is structured, and also on how the Jews view the idea of a Messiah. This is the backdrop for the arrival of a simple peasant with rather threatening ideas. That arrival and those ideas are thoughtfully presented in a way that makes for an interesting read.<br /><br />The events after the life of Jesus of Nazareth are interesting as well. There is a good deal of material on the divergent views of Saul of Tarsus (Paul) and James the Just. This helps illustrate how the path of the christian church deviated from the teachings of Jesus. Aslan does get a bit timid here though. You have to read between the lines to observe the conclusion that a couple of basic premises of the christian church were inventions of Paul which lacked any basis. On the other hand, Aslan does help the reader understand Paul's motives in promoting this altered view of the teachings of Jesus. Aslan is a bit more bold in the Notes section with his assertions. I guess the idea is only the more receptive readers are likely to be reading the notes. In any case, I'm sure Aslan is well aware of the kind of heat a book like this will take from the dogmatic sort of reader, so it looks like he was trying to avoid direct confrontation where he could.<br /><br />I would have liked to see some material on the early church itself. How and why did it grow outside of Palestine? I think this highlights a weakness of the book: the end of the story is a bit fuzzy. Aslanchose the destruction of Jerusalem as the place to end the story, and that makes sense, but that was decades after the death of Jesus, so he already extended the scope of the book beyond his life. In that case, why not carry it a bit further to help the reader understand where things went in the next hundred years or so when the church grew beyond a small movement. As it is, the book ends rather suddenly.
B00CUKTG2Q|4.0|I'm among the minority of Franz Ferdinand admirers who feel that their debut was good, but not great. I also believe they always release quality material, even \\"Tonight\\" had good parts to it. Every Franz Ferdinand release has something good to offer. \\"Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action\\" is one of the band's strongest, most consistent works to date. If they keep going with this new, revitalized, refreshed approach to making their music, they could become a force to reckon with in the music business.<br /><br />The band sounds like they're having fun this time around, something that was certainly absent from \\"Tonight\\". The lyrics are quite good here with barbs and jabs on songs like \\"Right Action\\", \\"Brief Encounters\\", \\"Evil Eye\\", \\"Goodbye Lovers & Friends\\", \\"Fresh Strawberries\\". I was hard pressed to find a song I didn't like on this album, but maybe \\"The Universe Expanded\\" might be it.<br /><br />But the band played it smart here by trimming the fat to 10 songs (my personal favorite length for an album) and about 35 minutes (my other personal favorite for length of an album--between 30 and 45 minutes). Every song is catchy and melodic with interesting lyrics and many with a wry sense of humor.<br /><br />You really can't go wrong with this new album, and I don't really comprehend the negative reviews here. I mean, this is still the same band that did 2004's \\"Franz Ferdinand\\", and I'd go so far as to say that this new album is better than their debut. So, if you liked their debut it makes sense that you would like this new album too. I am hoping that the band feel like making music more often now, and that we fans don't have to wait another 4 years for a new album.<br /><br />Here's how \\"Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action\\" compares to their earlier work:<br /><br />2004 Franz Ferdinand: Three and a Half Stars<br />2005 You Could Have It So Much Better: Four Stars<br />2009 Tonight: Franz Ferdinand: Three Stars<br />2013 Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action: Four StarsAction: Four Stars
B00ECUARO8|5.0|My only regret is that i didn't see this wonderful movie in the theater. Visually stunning, acting by all that is nuanced and heartfelt.... This movie is a true classic. I have never been a real Matthew McConaughey fan, but he is excellent in a very original role. This movie goes to dark places, but does so with grace and soul. The two young boys are also amazing actors.....I highly, highly recommend this movie.
B00ELU7A4E|5.0|I absolutley love this new song! Katy Perry is an amazing artist, talent & spirit.  She uses her gift to empower others & find their strength & beauty within.

Fry and Laurie exceed expectations, and I will never now not see Bertie's goggle eyed look without Hugh Laurie's face around it.  Other casting a bit more uneven (like life).  Great fun and faithful enough.

B009NFHF0Q|5.0|If you ever stepped on a path back to your own childhood and tried to trace memories, and dreams, and hopes, those things that blur in our minds, leaving only fractured feelings, then you will know what this book is about. Everyone has gone down that path, so everyone would know. I did too, and I cried at the end, because I didn't want it to end, this book. It brought me back to my past, to the time when I was little, to the places I imagined that were perhaps real, and perhaps they weren't. I felt like I'm swimming in liquid poetry, reading this, and I don't know what genre it's supposed to be, or what category, or what type of story, but I feel like this is a story for everyone, forever, and always. It's a story for those times when we forget to stop and look at the clouds, and get lost in their shifting shapes, or come back to an old place we remember from our childhood as big, wondering why it is so small now.<br /><br />The story is simple. A man travels back home to Sussex, England, for a funeral, and revisits his past, the pond at the end of the lane that his childhood friend Lettie Hempstock called her ocean. Could it be an ocean? And what really happened that day, the day it all happened? And what was it that did? The man sits on the bench by the pond and remembers strange events, one by one, as they happened some forty years ago, events about love and friendship and creation and loss, about strange creatures and birds and wormholes and kittens and, in between it all, about real life and real death and real love.<br /><br />It's achingly beautiful, all of it, and now I want to reread all of Gaiman's books all over again.

I'm able to connect with most of the songs, and I love the balance between calm and really powerful. I've been able to really connect with Lover of the Light and Hopeless Wanderer and I want to thank this band for being so amazing and having such a large part in my friend's life because they're probably the best band I've ever listened to.

B008Y7N7JW|3.0|I read the book and liked it, so thought I'd see the movie.  I found the film format distracting -- the action jumped around, it didn't move smoothly.  I didn't get invested in the characters in the movie like I did in the book.  I thought Woody Harrelson was the perfect casting for his part!<br /><br />Frankly, I snoozed a little in the middle!  So I guess the action was not exciting enough to keep me awake.  Read the book instead!

B008XBHIEY|5.0|The most frightening water flick EVER splashed on screen, Stephen Spielberg's Jaws will remain one of the best horror tales of all time. I'm telling you, the man should stick with more horror after the success of this and Poltergeist. The tension and buildup is all there, the terror, the shocking violence. We begin with a detailed, drawn out death and end with a gigantic explosion. What could be better?<br /><br /> Roy Sheider as Chief Brody rocks the screen. He is the main character, not the shark. A man with a wife (Lorriane Grey) and two kids, the chief of police of an island with a fear of water, he has a pretty well established set of morals and is the first the comprehend the large disaster that could be laying in wake. But small beach towns need money and he encounters resistance in closing the place down, mainly in the form of Mayor Vaughn (Murray Hamilton). Time to bring in the shark expert, marine biologist Matt (Richard Dreyfus). After the death of a little boy and the autopsy of what's left of Chrissie, a teenaged girl, the two together show us scenes that will forever remain in memory. The final throw in is Quint, a shark hunter by profession.<br /><br /> Spielberg shows us why he became such a blockbuster director with shark POV shots, cleverly not giving the shark much screen time to enhance when it is shown, and a long character driven story. Instead of focusing on just a killing machine he focuses more on what people go through in dealing with the predator. Tension is tight and riveting, attack scenes drawn out just right but not weighed down by too much melodrama, and the score complements the scenes perfectly. Effects wise Jaws doesn't look like a giant ball of rubber, and they were wise to keep his appearance to a minimum for this reason. So much better than CGI handicaps, a shame the prop was destroyed by deteriorating by Universal's lack of care.<br /><br /> The first half is on land; this is the best part of the flick. Seeing the attacks, the reactions, all great. But when on the boat the movie remains well-done. Quint's (Robert Shaw)long speech about his past experience with the white bellied, black eyed beings was classic. I especially enjoyed the touch of the killer whale in the background; it weaved together for a truly haunting effect.<br /><br /> Some genuinely tense, scary as hell scenes, a score that should go down in the books as one of the greatest, perfect chemistry among cast and injections of action and troubling imagery when it's needed the most. Sum it all up and it's easy to see why it added up to such a dynamic hit.reactions, all great. But when on the boat the movie remains well-done.

B005GFPZYK|5.0|Good narrative style. Never lagged. Real insight into what these guys who sacrifice their lives for our country face on a regular basis that we cannot comprehend. I loved the part where he meets a well known outspoken figure (Jesse Ven) in a bar and knocks him on his bum. I wish he would have knocked him out! Props to you Chris Kyle! May you rest well.
B0053TWVDC|3.0|This movie, based on the short story of the same name in Stephen King's night shift collection, takes on an interesting, creepy, original idea and squashes it like a mushy corn cake.<br /><br /> The film begins with promise, little evil kids peeking into the windows of a diner as other sadistic brats slaughter the adults inside. So yeah, the movie starts out with a bang but runs out of fuel way too fast. The main stars Burt and Vicky (Peter Horton and pre-Terminator Linda Hamilton) are the focal point while they're finding dead kids, weird distorted bibles, church meetings and parting corn fields. They are interesting enough characters but can't save this film from becoming just another video lining the store shelves.<br /><br /> A main issue is some of the annoying child actors. Malachai (Courtney Gains) acts well but has one of the biggest mouths I have ever seen (literally). You should see the size of this thing we he opens it wide and really goes to town with his Shakespearean speaking. And all of the combined dialogue of he and his partner in crime, John Franklin (Isaac), is atrocious. Two unforgivable sins: boring pace and too much chitchat the audience couldn't care less about.<br /><br /> Some of the slayings are cool enough but seem almost an afterthought to the constant preaching. Toss this up with a silly finale and it wraps up to be field fertilizer. I always love weird cult premises, they can be dark and morbid, but this one has the kids too melodramatic and doesn't delve deep enough into the story itself.<br /><br /> Another bad idea the creator's had was how the ended was executed. The story by itself before they started showing cheap effects in a cheesy wrap-up was slightly chilling simply because it could really happen. For the most part of the movie I saw the other children as brainwashed by two crazed older leaders. But the films ending blows any creepiness all to hell and takes on the job in the most laughable way possible. Rolling earth?? Brrrr....<br /><br /> Despite all these faults and being boring for the most part, the movie has some decent parts and is worth watching at least once for curiosity's sake. It's not horrible, it's not great, but it's there...just another video lining the store shelves....<br /><br /> Despite all these faults and being boring for the most part, the movie has some decent parts and is worth watching at least once for curiosity's sake.

B0002IQNAG|3.0|With one of the coolest taglines ever, Dawn of the Dead has a massive following in the horror community. Many people see Romero as a type of God, especially considering their adoration for the three zombie movies that made him so famous. In case you don't know and are brain dead yourself, Night of the living dead is the original, Dawn of the dead is the sequel, and Day of the Dead is the finale. Well, until land of the dead anyway, but that's a different story.<br /> We start with the world being overrun by rabid zombies looking to tear people to pieces. The viewer is greeted with some sickening shit, especially considering how fakish orange the blood looks. Four survivors consisting of two SWAT team members, a traffic reporter and his pregnant girlfriend, all come together and run like hell to salvation. They come up with the idea of camping out in the mall and blocking all the undead fiends on the outside. Their plan would have worked wonders if the bikers from hell hadn't shown up to crash the party.<br /><br />The plot itself is genius. A mall you say? Great atmosphere. Romero used this to his advantage, wanting to cash in a commentary about how America is obsessed with consumerism. It's made clear throughout what he was aiming for, but the whole thing isn't completely serious. There's some morbid humor behind a few corners, classic Romero style.<br /><br />On the good side of things, there's plenty of suspense. Just because these bad boys don't run doesn't mean they don't freak me out. The most suspenseful part of the movie is when that stupid idiot gets his arm bitten...was that not being so cocky it was his fault or what?? I was about to die watching that scene. Men, please stop letting machismo rule over common sense. I about had a heart attack. The more heart pounding scene...of the entire series!<br /><br />The acting is also very convincing. Ken Foree stands out and slides into his role with ease.  David Emge as Stephen hits all the right notes and prevails. Scott Reiniger (Roger) was born for the role, and Gaylen Ross plays the solo female remarkably well. The directing is tight and heightens suspense, and the score is pretty nifty, especially for the time period.<br /><br />On the bad side of things, and yes - gulp - I said bad, some of the effects weren't to my liking. I despised the blood; hate that look. It ruined most of the death scenes for me, and in horror if the death scenes are ruined, well...that just bites. The pacing was developed well but I felt was more sluggish than it had to be at times. When the credits rolled I just sat there, let down. I think maybe I took too long to see this movie; all those years of hype slaughtered it. I enjoyed it but was expecting much more. Instead it came across campy, cheesy, and not as frightening as I would have liked. I enjoyed the acting, the characters, but not too deeply.<br /><br />Yell at me, shoot me, and put me out of my misery, but Dawn of the Dead was just an average horror flick in my eyes. Regarded by many as a ruler of the genre, I just don't get the magic. Perhaps if I had seen it in another decade, when I was younger, or if I hadn't heard all the hype first....Irregardless, it is what it is, and it's not bad, ...but it's not amazing either.ls.

0767817664|4.0|One of the better 80's horror films, Fright Night takes a slightly new twist on an old story and entertains us the whole way through.<br /><br /> Charlie spies on his new neighbors and discovers one of them is a suave vampire named Jerry Dandridge, but it's not always easy to convince doubting friends, and Charlie has a hell of a time getting his pal Evil Ed and girlfriend Amy to see the light. The addition of Charlie being a young teenage horror fan was pretty clever on Holland's part. Because of his fascination with the dark side, it limits his credibility when he start spewing off about ancient vampires right next door.<br /><br /> Unfortunately time is running out and Jerry knows he knows, and knows he knows that he knows he knows. And yes, something in there makes sense. In desperation Charlie tries to get the help of a horror monster show host Peter Vincent (nix the name Peter Cushing and Vincent Price). Things don't go as planned but the guy grudgingly agrees to try and assist; from then on we're on our way to a knee-jerking climax.<br /><br /> The major strength of this film lies in Christopher Sarandon's bi-sexual portrayal of Jerry. This man is a wet dream come true and makes every shot pure gold. He has the personality of old-world vampire charm and it's really a shame I haven't seen him in more horror (although he's been in plenty). Every time he's on the set my eyes remain glued to the screen and my glands start salivating. Maybe I should stop now while I'm ahead...<br /><br /> His daywatcher/human servant (Billy Cole) is creepy in a way and his cup holds its own volume of twisted charm. Amanda Bearse (pre-Married with Children) shows up as Amy and does a surprisingly good job as a cute, bubbly, and interesting side-character. Charlie (William Ragsdale), the main character, does the role well and his friend Evil Ed (Stephen Geoffreys) plays the part to a tee but his character is a little annoying. Another great charm is the cowardly vampire hunter Peter (Roddy McDowall) -- he brings plenty of humor when he walks in. A recently fired, non-believer he has to be convinced but when he sees it's real his knees begin to shake and his pants become a little wet but this just makes it all the more comical.<br /><br /> This movie isn't frightening but it's not meant to be. It does have some nail-biting suspenseful moments -- especially when Dandridge pays a visit to Charlie's house and visits with him and his mother. There's also a good dosage of comedy but never goofy. Lot's of old time spoof nods to past vampire legends and rules of the trade in a flattering, fun way. A nice nod to the 80's, it had some great music that enhanced and never took away from the quality. (Tangerine Dream -- Firestarter; and Brad Fiedel (The Terminator, Serpent of the Rainbow)<br /><br /> A light, lovable film that causes smiles, groans, grimaces, and overall enjoyment -- definitely a keeper.(Roddy McDowall) -- he brings plenty of humor when he walks in.

There's also a good dosage of comedy but never goofy. Lot's of old time spoof nods to past vampire legends and rules of the trade in a flattering, fun way. A nice nod to the 80's, it had some great music that enhanced and never took away from the quality. (Tangerine Dream -- Firestarter; and Brad Fiedel (The Terminator, Serpent of the Rainbow)<br /><br /> A light, lovable film that causes smiles, groans, grimaces, and overall enjoyment -- definitely a keeper.

B000O14VAU|2.0|Underworld is a sleek, stylish action/horror flick that did pretty well at the box office. It touted an appetizing lead and promised mucho action, slow mo movements, and an intriguing tale. While it did deliver on all this (and more), it didn't get my horror heart a pumping, mainly for the very reasons it boasted.<br />Don't get me wrong, sleep directing and beautiful cinematography usually go hand in  hand with a good movie, no matter what the genre. This is a good nod in the movies direction. I just couldn't find much substance under this shiny pearl. From point A to point Z, we have fighting,  quarreling, fighting, plot, combating, plot, and fighting some more. Much like the Matrix and Blade, the film focuses primarily on kicking skills over chilling skills. If you have vampires and lycanthropes in the mix, it's always a good idea to attempt some fear too.<br /><br />As the plot unfolds, there is an old war between the fangs and the furries. Selene, who is the beautiful vampire assassin, finds out there is going to be an attempt by the sneaky werewolves to kidnap Michael Corvin, a human. This may help cease the war finally, but not in the way Selene wants it to end. Naturally she interferes, but her blood starts heating at the sight of the werewolf bitten human. Another plot obstacle is that she begins going against her people in her decisions.<br /><br /> The story itself sounds good on paper and could have looked terrific on screen. Instead they chose to not pay enough attention to plot development. Action and plot intermingling has to be done carefully, or else you just get an all out action fest without much point, or an interesting story that doesn't have enough fight scenes to satisfy action hounds. It's a hard situation to beat, and frankly they didn't succeed here in the way I'd have liked. If the story were more developed, if I had cared more about some of the characters, and if more menace had been mixed with bite, I would have been a much happier camper.<br /><br />Also, since one of the driving forces behind the plot is supposed to be a romantic love mess between Selene and the mortal, it was poorly unexplored. We gets hints here and there of this and that, but nothing in the face that shows us how truly valuable the love is to either. It's almost an afterthought and behind the scenes kind of deal. If this had been played up more in the story, I'd be delighted.<br /><br />As with any movie of this form, weapons are galore. It's not just the moves the audience gets to drool over, it's the artillery. Our eyes get treated with supernatural critters being slayed with silver blade and bullets filled with such yummy substances as silver nitrate. Pretty cool stuff. The action sequences were fine as they stood; plenty of blustering and quarreling made stylish. Some of the scenes were heart racing and visually strong, I must give the movie credit for that.<br /><br />For the acting, Kate Beckinsale was a great advertising tool. I'm sure many teenage (and adult) boys were itching to see the flick just to see the hot foreign actress in tight, black leather. To her credit, she does act well, but her character is relatively lifeless. I didn't see as emotion as I would have liked. It's spoken of what she goes through, and shown, but I didn't get the fear/drama/sadness from her personality alone. As an assassin that's determined and strong, she comes through here with shining colors. Lucian was the best of them all, as he had more character development and was someone I actually gave a damn about. He had a purpose, a motivation, and reasoning behind this was fulfilled. Way to go there. Bill Nighy as the resurrected ancient did his role very well.<br /><br />While I didn't warm up to everything here, I have to get credit to the directing. Positively breathtaking. The film has a purposeful blue hue cast over it, painting it a gorgeous gothic shade. Doom and gloom is easily felt during each frame. The effects of Underworld were nothing short of amazing. Werewolves looked most convincing, without using much CGI. The blood and gore were plentiful enough to obtain an R rating, so this was a plus as well. The soundtrack is strong and pleasing to the ears, a great match.<br /><br />Since we're dealing with vamps and wolves here I'd have preferred more fang versus claw. Instead we get weapons and guns, which in a way doesn't quite fit. Overall a movie that's shiny and sparkly but also lackluster. Could have been better than it was. As it stands, only an average flick that deserves a viewing or so, but not a buy.othing short of amazing. Werewolves looked most convincing, without using much CGI.

B004ZMWUCU|2.0|I wanted to like this book, and I managed to finish it because the setting and the characters are initially interesting. I didn't care for the unoriginal writing. The writing is better in the chapters describing the gruesome life in an orphanage. At the end of the book, the author says that the deplorable conditions are well documented. However, the reality is questionable when written in the context of this novel. The orphanage chapters might have worked better if the present day chapters hadn't been so light hearted and the characters so animated. Think of a chapter of Angela's Ashes followed by a chapter of an old Doris Day comedy. The two tones just didn't work together.  The plot was predictable and the ending made me roll my eyes.
6305291446|2.0|Halloween severly now went downhill (past redemption?) when they had the lame brained idea to create THIS movie.<br /><br /> Let us count the ways this movie reeked:<br /><br /> One was the teen bopper cast -- Some could actually act but that wasn't the point. It pisses me off when horror film producers cast teen idols just to rake in the dough and teen audiences. All characters portrayed were stereotypical, senseless splatter fodder we care NOTHING about. Most moves they do are either stupid or may as well been read out loud in a rule book. Obvious moves = less suspense.<br /><br /> Jamie Lee Curtis was a saving role. It was great to see her again but her personality was a bit ho-hum. Thankfully she acts convincingly even if her character is a little flaky. The relationship she had with her son Josh was realistic, and the tension they had flying on screen could be felt in the air. LL Cool J Makes a debut as the funny security guard -- he can act but should have kept his ass out of this movie. I don't have any wish to see humurous side characters inserted into a film JUST to make people laugh. At least Janet Leigh had a small cameo.<br /><br /> The setting is a school where Laurie (with her name change of course) is a teacher. That did make sense because of how she was in High School. Apparently she had faked her own death certificate. How the hell did ol' Mike find her?? We are never given an explanation.<br /><br /> Michael also seems to be getting his ass majorly kicked lately. The ending is a cool enough confrontation but nothing dynamic was blended in. All females seem to be there for the male eyes, and the males for the quick and easy kills.<br /><br /> John Carpenters score was heard very briefly but the main music from Marco Beltrami is too close to the \\"scream\\" score for comfort.<br /><br /> Kevin Williamson was asked to write the script and did an outline. But the end result was croped up by Robert Cappia and Matt Greenberg. So any blame cannot fall on just Williamson, as I have seen it commonly done. Some of his ideas that were tossed out of the window actually were good. Producer is none other than Steve Miner (Friday the 13th 2, 3, House)<br /><br /> Thankfully some thrills were suspensful but they quickly fell flat and the gore was watered. It seemed the movie was chocked full of shocks designed simply to obtain oohs and aahs from the audience in a theatre. Not my idea of horror.<br /><br /> In the end it seems Myers has been cheapened and possibly castrated.t Williamson, as I have seen it commonly done.

B004X6PRO6|4.0|It took me forever to initially become engaged in this book. I almost gave up early on. The beginning is very abrupt. It is definitely not an \\"easy\\" read, but that's what makes it so interesting. This is boot camp reading--so expect to work hard. I marched forward and almost gave up a second time (weakling that I am) before I became engaged again--about the time the characters made it to Texas--ah, familiar territory. If you are someone who does not want to work to make sense of a book, this one may not be for you. I can't honestly say that I liked this book \\"while\\" I was reading it because I was confused most of the time. However, after I finished it, I liked it a lot, painful as it was to get there. If you enjoy post-modern literature, this book will be your thing. It's structure, characters, setting, and point of view while very original, make this book a challenge that does become easier--but not until maybe half way through. It's after I finished it that I really savored it. That's when it all sort of clicked and made sense. All my hard work payed off. Very interesting and original book.
B000ICXQOM|4.0|Sam Raimi really obtained a cult following for himself when he directed the low budget shock-fest Evil Dead. He drew even more in when he seasoned the sequel with more over the top gore and slap stick comedy. Now when the minions in his league, he decided to make the series a trilogy and end it on the right note. In his mind this 'right note' was to make the third more of a comedy than anything else, with some action threw in there, any horror being more humorous than not. He doped up the character of Ash a bit more than the second, and much more than the original, and this is what we get.<br />Starting off where the end of the second left off, Ash has been sucked in a time vortex and now ends up in the medieval ages. Here, he finds himself feared and throw into a pit to be attacked by the ugliest creatures known to man. When he conquers these 'deadites', he earns respect to a point and the villagers aren't trying to sacrifice him any longer. However, it gets much much worse, for some serious s*** is reeking in the horizon.<br /><br />As mentioned before briefly, Ash is a bit different. He's still the same crazy, comical guy we all know to love, but in an even more extreme manner. Almost everything that comes out of his mouth is cutesy and memorable, and his gestures are exaggerated. He totes weapons like they're medals and refuses to take crap from anybody. His 'accident's are more common, as he's a goofy kind of guy, making him look like a clumsy, idiotic ox. On some levels this works as they are just heightening the already beloved character from the second, but on another level making him this silly brings the whole series down a notch, more cartoonish and flimsy.<br /><br />It's an obvious comedy and some of the scenes are truly funny. You wont be able to die completely content unless you've seen Ash fight Evil Ash, mini Ashes, and get his face 'stretched.' Raimi's direction works as good as always, making this movie the best it could be with him in the chair. Bruce Campbell naturally acts amazing and never lets up. He was born to play Ash and anyone who sees this flick is made well aware of that real fast. Embeth Davitz, who plays Ash's child interest Shiela, does her job well as a supporting role (although her personality pissed me off a few times)<br /><br />One will definitely notice that the gore here is not as abundant as before. Apparently with the humor and watered down gore, they were aiming for a more mainstream flick to reach out for other audiences. While not a bad idea for the money angle, fans of the series who were watering at the mouths when hearing this was finally coming out may have been a tad disappointed. They wanted more of their Evil Dead, with slight changes natural of course, no something so radically changed. It works but in a different way than it worked before, which is both good...and bad.Bruce Campbell naturally acts amazing and never lets up.

B001RJTFP4|4.0|You just know there's going to be trouble at the party when the fire sprinklers release blood, not water.<br /><br /> The plot for Blade, if you don't know it already, is simple. Blade's mother was bitten by a vampire shortly before going into labor. What resulted was a half-breed with all the strengths of the vampires - strength, speed - but none of their weaknesses. He can venture into the sun, he can withstand garlic and silver. But he has their bloodlust, one he refuses to indulge. He has donned the nickname \\"Daywalker.\\"<br /><br /> It shows he has teamed up awhile back with an old man with long hair and an interesting attitude named Whistler. Whistler's family was slain by vampires and he hates them as much as his sidekick. He spends his time concocting numerous creative weaponry and other powerful ammunition for their war. He also created the serum Blade injects to fight off the cravings for that bright red liquid nourishment that is splattered onscreen throughout. Together their mission is to wipe out as many bloodsucking freaks as they can.<br /><br /> Another character is a woman, Dr. Karen Jensen, who is slowly turning into the undead through a bite. She tries to help Blade and Whistler on their goal. Trained in Martial Arts and knowing how to handle every weapon possible, Blade has now met his biggest match in the first installment of the Blade series. (Trust me, they won't just stop with 2)<br /><br /> A half-blood vampire named Deacon Frost (Stephen Doriff) has a plan. He's not happy with the current order of things and wants to get rid of the current council, resurrect an ancient vampire God, and make it so that instead of outcasts, vampires will be viewed as the leaders of the world. This wicked plan includes Blade as a main pawn in the game but he's not a willing player.<br /><br /> Action-adventure and martial arts lovers will be cheering from their seats. There's enough kicking action to have made Bruce Lee jealous. And these movies have plenty of the slosh to satisfy gore hounds. The death scenes of the vamps are brilliant, exciting, and delightfully messy.<br /><br /> The opening with the party club scene where Blade first shows his bad ass face got my heart pumping already. You just know there's going to be trouble with the fire sprinklers start spraying blood instead of water from the ceiling. Blade boasted powerful directing and eye catching production shots, adrenaline-filled action scenes, and great acting.<br />Of course this movie wasn't perfect though. I thought the mother sub-plot toward the end was a bit too out there and contrived. Also, the movie relied a bit too much on action than on true emotion, making it come off a bit stale when it could have held more genuine drama. This movie is full of eye candy so that when you dig through the fluff there's not a great deal left.<br /><br />The plot is simple and straight forward; it's all about kicking vampire butt and leaving no survivors.the slosh to satisfy gore hounds.

B00DM0XXCM|5.0|I never write reviews on movies... So, the reason I am giving my opinion is the effect this movie had on me.  First, it was highly creative!!!!  It used a different concept entirely from any other movie I had ever seen. The movie challenged our imagination and had us look at life from a different angle. Second, the visual effects were awesome. It was a feast for the eyes. I felt wonder and awe as I watched this stunning story and visual effects. Third, it was full of love and hope. I walked away from this movie feeling wonderful. Really, no bad scenes!  So...why is this movie not even known to me until now!!!! Because it doesn't have the usual sex scenes and violence that comes from Hollywood movies. It relied on a well written story and great visual effects. It also relied on human strength and love.  Anyone else out there that feels like I do will love this movie. It is definitely worth every minute of your time to watch this movie.  Again this is an A+ movie!!!
B009JZTQOS|4.0|From Dusk till Dawn is an action/horror flick with a lead man, Seth (George Clooney), who is hot off the rack and well regarded by females everywhere. His sidekick brother Richie (Quentin Tarrantino) is a greatly respected director known for doing controversial, stylish films. It seems unimaginable at first glance that the likes of these two, particularly the former, would be doing a movie such as this, and obviously having fun while doing it, but they did it anyway and gave us cinema to google over.<br /> Two brothers, both from prison, are on the run and ready to cross the border to obtain their freedom. One doesn't seem half bad; in fact, he's bad ass, delivering macho lines, wearing a cool, nothing can touch me attitude, defensive of his brother, and into morals despite his addiction to theft and killing if he has to. His tag along, on the other hand, was in prison for different reasons. Apparently he enjoys girls, but not in a healthy manner (depending on who you talk to anyway).  He enjoys both rape and brutal mutilation. This is demonstrated through bizarre flashes in the film when good brother walks in on bad brothers leftovers.<br /><br />One of the best scenes in the film was in the beginning where 'good brother' Seth witnesses the after effects of this transgression and admits aloud that his brother is a sick nut case and that something is severely wrong with him. Blood is thicker than justice in this case, though, and Seth accepts the bad seed despite his many 'issues'. Determined to keep a better eye on the violent sibling and have them escape with all body parts intact, they hijack an RV driven by dad, sis, and brother. None of these characters are particularly terrified of the killers, possessing attitudes of their own, but they're also not stupid and go along with the ride.<br /><br />The group ends up in a rough house bar while waiting for their ride to freedom. (Friend and $$$)  At the bar they are greeted by the doorman who advertises the bar, aptly called the 'Titty Twister', with how many types of 'pussy' they have. It really is a comedic addition, even if just sounds offensive, tasteless, and raunchy from description. I guess you have to see it to appreciate the humor. Anyway, once inside things are going relatively well (we even get a nice dance from Salma Hayek), but after this all hell breaks loose. Apparently the bar is just a front for hungry (or is it thirsty???) for hungry vampires who feed on the unsuspecting consumers.<br /><br />Plot holes aside (you would think that if they slaughtered an entire bar full of people regularly, someone somewhere would get suspicious), the bad ass brothers do their best to protect themselves and the more naive hostages. Full fighting ensues until the vamps are blocked in other rooms, and it's up to the survivors to figure out a way to work together and live....at least until dawn.<br /><br />This movie is vicious, brutal, employs trashy vocabulary, nudity, humorous moments, cold killing, and of course some stereotypes. However, it was original for a vampire flick of this day and age and actually worked. The fighting scenes didn't take the movie down to the level where that was all it was about. Instead, it only made it more fun. Gore is plentiful and always welcomed when it splashed. Great stuff. The dialogue was tainted with occasional corniness but it didn't detract from the film. You expect one liners when bad asses kill vampires, so as long as it's not too lame it's looked over and brushed under the rug.<br /><br />Clooney at the ultimate cool brother does an admirable job. You can't tell he was ever an ER doc from this role. He's calm, poised, and determined. His brother, Richie, played very well by Tarrantino, convinces the world  he is one sick pup that needs to be put down! Juliette Lewis, who usually irritates me to no end, carries her own weight here and only irritates me mildly. Her brother, Scott, (Ernest Liu) does his job and isn't annoying for a kid actor. The father, who is also a priest gone dry (didn't mention that before, did I?), Harvey Keitel, was well suited for the part and injected more flavor into the role. No complaints here.<br /><br />They didn't just try for niceties with this movie and I appreciate that. The violence was heavy, the gore thick, the acting fine, the directing just plain cool (especially with those quick flashes ), and the music rock only accentuated the action. From Dusk Till Dawn is a surprising treat, one that gives what it promises in trailers.ctor.

B001TDJYWC|5.0|Ah...childhood memories. I used to watch this one and part two constantly as a wee horror fan. Light, comedic horror that always left me giggling and having the greatest of times. It may be a spinoff of Gremlins but I had more delight with this classic monster fest than the Dante thriller. This isn't the type of humor that's up in your face the entire time. More like cheesy with humor sprinkled at appropriate moments.<br /><br /> The critters themselves? In a way adorable, and all the way deadly. Little furry creatures that turn into balls and roll when they chase. They even sometimes let out a small bounce! Big hands and big feet, the cuteness ends there. They have sharp teeth and nasty little faces. They shoot poison darts (yes, poison darts) out of their skin when they roll into a ball. Plurally known as \\"crites\\", these little bastards have bottomless pits for appetites and zero compassion. Humans, cattle, inanimate objects -- beware! And they even have their own little critter language that you witness briefly.<br /><br /> The funniest scene that always leaves me in stitches is when one of the critters confronts a stuffed ET doll.<br /><br /> Not frightening but lots of fun and an excellent cast. Dee Wallace Stone, the exceptional actress in several horror roles, is the Mom. She plays that part of a lot in these movies. The father Jay is played by Billy Green Bush and is a convincing dad/farmer. Little Bradley Brown, starring Scott Grimes, is the main character in the first two movies. He's the little kid with the attitude with strict parents but the typical exploring nature boys that age have. He also is the one who first knows about the critters. We even see a pre-fame Billy Zane :)<br /><br /> The only complaint is Charley. (Don Keith Opper) His character is more annoying to the nerves than a Critter chewing on them. Unfortunately he becomes a staple for the entire series. Other townsfolk, like the sheriff are tossed in the stew pot, and Bradley's sister has a small role. And a few cows :)<br /><br /> Besides Earth inhabitants wanting to stop the critters before they spread, we have two bounty hunters from space with critter demise on the mind. Pretty interesting and unique guys who have no face or identifiable shape and must choose an image to duplicate. One of them, who I gather as the leader, chooses a rock star body. The other is never happy with that he chooses. They bring along big ass guns and plenty of explosions.<br /><br /> Almost no gore as, surprisingly, this was PG-13. It's not a bad movie at all but I was still a little taken back by this rating. The 2nd has more gore and nudity and I really doubt that wasn't R.<br /><br /> This is not to say that this movie is a just a light flirt with the darkside. Suspense IS built in sometimes, the deaths are obviously painful, the critters are evil little SOBS always on the hunt for a new (live) snack. They also tend to destroy everything and are quite the little vandals.<br /><br /> There are some slightly tense moments but mainly in the name of fun, having you hold your breath waiting for a critter ball to come flying out of nowhere.<br /><br /> Pure critter cheese but it doesn't attempt anything else; it makes no apologies and takes no prisoners.a small role.

B0006Z2LH4|3.0|The first Cube rocked my world and left me grinning for hours. It possessed stylish deaths, an amazing idea, living up to its reputation and ambition. The third flick decided to further explore the source of the ' cube', trying to attempt a back story that made sense. Personally I think that when the first one was made, they were leaving it as an unknown to have it creepier, but likely didn't have an idea in hand since it wouldn't be used. Now, to make another movie, they had to rack their brains and come up with something.<br /> It works in some ways and in others it doesn't. It's a plausible explanation, but carried out at times with a goofy execution. What is up with the droid intelligence men? I didn't get into the whole 'man upstair' kind of thing when they came down. It was cool in a way when they were unseen. They basically did an admirable job in creating something that makes some sort of sense, but I prefer more people in the maze stuff.<br /><br />The acting was better than the first films, but I never got to care about the characters the same. The only one I really felt affection for was the lead Zachary Bennett. He convinced me to care about him and be on his side. His lady crush, Cassandra, played by Stephanie Moore, conveyed fear and anguish well. All others did their part but these are the two that stood out to me the most.<br /><br />Gore is painted on thicker, and we still get the classic death scenes. Again we see another man vs. wire, but the originals was a bit better. The acid scene here is a lot more vicious though, starting the movie off with a hellish note. Nasty! The directing by Ernie Barbarash is ambitious and the score works, even if it is a little lackluster.<br /><br />Overall definitely not as good as the first. It tries too hard to explain itself and I didn't sense any of the paranoia and claustrophobia I did in the first. The most I felt was suspense in the 'back room'. The acting improved but the characters weren't as likeable, save one. Rent the first and if you like it, you'll probably enjoy this one as well.<br /><br />One problem that bugs me is that I don't see how it can really be a prequel. The cube here seems more advanced than in the original. If in this movie they applied acid to the letters to keep them from figuring it out, what about in part one's situation? It showed all the cube blocks getting marred from the stuff. Also, I wasn't sure if the ending was to imply the man (can't give away more than this) was the same from the first film. If so, how could he have survived that long without food and water?one.

B009BDVD2Q|5.0|or devotees of King, the first half of the book was a true treat, where the author takes time to tell us the highlights of his life that influenced him into the writer he became. Heartfelt memories of his mother, brother, wife, and children were a joy to read, with me growing teary-eyed on an occasion or two. I was delighted to see small things in his childhood that reminded me of things to come in later books (like IT.) His mothers support of him from the beginning was, I think, a crucial part of his development. One of the more emotional areas of the books, it's good to have someone fighting in your corner and keeping your hopes up. After his mother, there was his wife, all playing their big parts in who he became.<br /><br />It's stimulating to see other authors (or anyones) love of books, comics, and old horror movies from their past.<br />The viewers that come to this blog share this, for we're universally tied together through our memories of a beloved passion that shapes us so greatly.<br />In fact, at the book's closing, King lists recommended reads from the last three to four years.<br /><br />He tells of his drug and alcohol addiction. I enjoyed his parting line on the section, stating (not word-for-word) that while creative types may be more inclined to be users, this isn't an excuse, it doesn't matter, as we \\"all look the same puking in the gutter.\\"<br /><br />The self-revelation he had that he was actually writing about himself in 'The Shining', and that Misery was about the coke and booze, was intriguing. It's clear King was a born writer, saying it's more work NOT to write on a daily basis, drawn to it where he kept trying and not giving up, even from the period of Junior High.<br /><br />Once the memoir has passed, he delves into a variety of writing advice. No quick how-tos, exercises (okay, a small parting one...), but instead discusses his viewpoints on the craft of writing, showing high respect for 'The Elements of Style', warning against those pesky adverb overdoses, too much wording fluff (guilty!), and dialogue sins. I'd say his most repeated, emphasized advice is \\"read a lot, write a lot.\\"<br /><br />I found through this book that King doesn't outline, that he places characters into bizarre situations and writes to get them out of it, he doesn't rely as heavily on plot as some. He gives advice to new writers on literary agents, discusses the importances of re-writes and then gives an indepth-description of how he does his, including at the end of revised example in the second draft of \\"1408\\". Much love is given to his wife, Tabitha, listing her as his ideal reader. King discusses the importance of having a select few to give their ideas on your book before sending it off. He spends a chapter discussing so called creative writing courses and groups, not dismissing them outright but rich in his common sense as he honestly shares his viewpoint on how they may not help you grow.<br /><br />If I have one complaint, it's that I'd love for the book to be longer, to hear more indepth details about certain older books. Since Carrie was his first published novel, he shared how the idea came, how Tabitha helped encourage him, how he found many of the facts, and how it grew from there. It was interesting how he said The Stand was his hardest to write, and that he almost gave up on it, and it took him the longest since he put it away in a drawer for a time. It's not so much interesting because of him and the book exactly, but because this is the sort of situation almost every writer will eventually run into.<br /><br />Even if you're not a prospective writer, this is interesting stuff. It's not a guidebook or an instruction manual, it's just a writer's life being discussed. 'On Writing' is nowhere near a definite guideline, but King makes this clear up-front anyway. There really are no 'definite guidelines' in writing, you either write or you don't. If you're interested in King at all, the thoughts on writing perhaps show more about him and his life than anything else.s show more about him and his life than anything else.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|It's amazing how you get pulled into this book. Somehow the conceit of a person telling another character stories of the past makes it even more vivid, eventually painting a detailed picture of the entire world's struggle
B00000JMOF|5.0|When the novel by Mary Shelley was adapted to film, it met with great success. The underlying themes are plentiful, particularly focusing on a man's misguided motivations to create life, illustrating the dire consequences of trying to play God. When Victor Frankenstein shouted \\"It's alive, it's alive,\\" he didn't know this wasn't necessarily a reason for celebration.<br /><br />Dr. Victor Frankenstein is obssessed. Fascinated by science and spurred on my his own intelligence, he seeks the ultimate power by creating a living being our of scattered body parts. Eager to revel in sharing with the world a person he breathed life into with his own two hands, he doesn't stop to ponder on the grave consequences. For when the eyes open and the brain functions, the good doctor sees defeat and tragedy in the eyes looking back at him. Realizing he's made a horrible mistake and unable to look at what he thought would have been his greatest achievement, he instead shuns his created child and tries to avoid the errors of his ways. Like an absentee father, he shuffles away, hoping that out of sight and out of mind may mean out of existence. We know this isn't so, and he soon finds he can't escape the monster he's created.<br /><br />There's really no need to retell the whole story, as it's clearly a well known one that has imprinted its memory in the minds of numerous generations. Karloff's childlike and confused monster is a face that's mandatory recognizing by the time a child's ten. Costumes are still adorned in his image at Halloween, Universal is still shoveling out statutes and stuffed animals and masks, and dozens upon dozens of horror flicks have either references or inspirations from this influential film. One of my favorite references is in Bride of Chucky when Chucky tosses a TV playing Bride of Frankenstein into the bathtub with Tiffany, electrocuting her to death. When the monster first has life bolted into it from lighnting, to his shuffling and buffling walk, he's addictive and it's easy to see why he's an idol even to this day. Karloff did an admirable job bringing an undead character to life, and Pierce's makeup work was astonishing, particularly for that day and age. It's a shame it was so hard on the poor actor, though, as in addition to his small pay check he earned back problems.<br /><br />Science and the dangers of messing with things man shouldn't are highlighted clearly here. After this film many more went on, and still will, to showcase this in their own way.<br /><br />Even if this film no longer frightens or disturbs, it's still intriguing, fascinating, and full of moral lessons that will always ring uncomfortably true. The atmosphere is dark and surrealistic, filled with rich cinematography, gothic styled imagery, and painted with shadows and depth. Director James Whale was creative with his foreshadowing and subtle camera moves. There isn't much of a score here, but sound effects are used effectively when needed, such as the ringing of a bell. Boris Karloff as the intimidating monster is an ideal choice; he brings life to the undead creature, and the special effects used to create his image are both imaginative and visually appealing.<br /><br />Colin Clive as the doctor overacts big time, but it's suited here. He may as well have been born for the part. When he has the manic and obsessed glee in his eye, it's easy to feel his enthusiasm. When he mourns and regrets, it's clear as day to see that too. Dwight Frye is an excellent morbid, derformed<br /><br />Frankenstein was one of the big Universal hits of the 30's, retaining serious vibes that are clear from the start, with a fast enough pace to not bore the viewer. The social commentary is easily recognizable, although may seem to get different interpretations, resulting in countless papers being written on this movie alone. Unlike the fanged Dracula, Frankenstein was intended to be more of a sympathetic creation, showing that society may actually be the more monstrous of the two.<br /><br />This classic never out lives its welcome. Even today it's a wonderful journey through cinema history, and I for one had great fun watching the monster be born again, only to see his depressing demise, and absorb all that this film teaches us. If you haven't seen Frankenstein, stop what you're doing right now, run to the video store, and rent it. It's worth it for all ages, no matter what the decade. Stories such as this never lose their appeal.strous of the two.<br /><br />This classic never out lives its welcome.

B004VFK5LO|3.0|Sigourney Weaver plays Dr. Helen Hudson, a serial killer profiler who, after being attacked in the bathroom years before at a public speech, begins hiding out at home with a nasty case of agoraphobia. Years pass and bodies start popping up - key in two detectives intent on solving the crime. Detectives M.J. Monahan (Holly Hunter) and Reuben Goetz (Dermot Mulroney) seek out Hudson's aide in finishing off this killer before he makes even bigger headlines.<br /><br /> What follows is actually a grossly enriching, deliciously tantalizing thriller that entertained me from the beginning attack to the final exchange. We don't have yet another senseless and mainly plotless thriller spin off here -- although this may explain how this gem got accidently buried. With so many senseless dribble out there, the audience starts losing track of the really good ones to keep their eyes on.<br /><br /> Agoraphobia is an awful thing and director Jon Amiel knows how to show this. Clever tilts and shots -- I almost felt like I was feeling a bit of the panic and dizziness myself. He does a great job having me sympathize with Weaver's character.<br /><br /> Unlike some other thriller's out there this one isn't predictable either. Well, it's not an award winning mind buster but it's also not a step-by-step guidebook. Some of the deaths I didn't predict, and some I didn't until their number was nearly up, but overall it was just plain interesting.<br /><br /> As always Weaver is genuine and focused as Helen. Holly Hunter as the female, hard-ass but realistic detective is just as convincing. Dermot Mulroney was cute and I loved his personality, he surprised me in the film. William NcNamara and Harry Connick Jr. are both creepy as hell and could NOT have been better chosen for their roles. (brrrrr) The hair lifted on my arms at a few scenes.<br /><br /> Copycat isn't gory or bloody but some of the deaths are brutal or else there are implications of violence. More psychological than eye candy.<br /><br /> One in the top pick of the litter, Copycat isn't just \\"another serial killer hunt\\" to bury along with countless others. With some startling turns and grim realities, this bad boy belong on the shelves of serial killer flick lovers.r /><br /> One in the top pick of the litter, Copycat isn't just \\"another serial killer hunt\\" to bury along with countless others.

B000GWE44U|5.0|The Shining remains one of the best horror films ever made to date and there are several reasons why. One is that it's very character orientated. We grow to know the characters Jack, Wendy, and Danny well enough to care what happens to them, and also to live what they're experiencing. While Shelley is generally annoying, Danny is cute and well acted, and Jack is demented enough to steal every scene he's in.<br /><br /> At his finest, his depiction of a stressed ex-alcoholic descending rapidly into madness is legendary. The showdown scenes with Jack finally snaps were well-orchestrated. His nutty state of mind was shown from the start, but he also had a humorous side (demented but still there) that came through. Duvall exhibits sheer terror to perfection; her mousy overly submissive nature may get on ones' nerves but this personality helps impel the movie along. The contrast between the strong and neurotic hubby and the uncertain, reluctant wife creates a deeper impact when the final showdown begins. She was my least favorite character, however, as I said before she tended to get on the nerves. Danny was a very effective little actor and knew how to be freaky when needed. The \\"tony in the mouth\\" was eerie.<br /><br />Another key factor was the total and utter isolation once the storm really hit. Cut off, eventually, from any outside help. And before this, cut off from any other human companionship whatsoever. A lot of movies explore the theme of cabin fever but it isn't always achieved like this. I wonder how the Wilderness family does it? I can easily see Skip going nuts and slaughtering his wife and the two annoying, unrealistic kids Jenny and Toby with an axe!<br /><br /> Yet another excellent aspect was the scenery. Even the name - The Overlook - simple yet powerful - invokes a certain feeling. Not many of the rooms are shown in detail; the could have been done to either not confuse the audience with too much at once, or it could have been done to make the isolation even more effective, causing the hotel itself and the surroundings to seem more closed in, smaller, tighter spaces.<br /><br />For the hotel itself the inside shots were great, but the outside shots were just as effective. Such an ordinary looking location that somehow managed to transmit vibrations of gloom. The addition of the outside maze was nonesuch; I loved the scene where Jack was looking through the maze figurine and then it shot to where Danny and Wendy were actually playing in it. The maze was used to wrap up to a different type of ending. Instead of having the movie full of music every step of the way we have an eerie sense of silence; this, to me, is more frightening. When music is played it's perfect. Simple yet chilling.<br /><br />The concept of having the shining as a unique, psychic like gift was neat; I loved that plot sideline. Danny certainly wasn't your everyday kid. This story doesn't stick strongly to Kings book and comes out all the better for it; this is Kubricks version and I fell in love with it. So many people had read the book and knew what happened in it; seeing it in a different perspective on screen was refreshing. Two different versions that were still so much the same.<br /><br />There are some scenes that really stick out as galvanizing, but throughout the entire picture we're filled with a sense of dread and impending doom. The directing was superb; everything had that cold, institutional feel. Nothing was corny or comedic about THIS one. Since the movie didn't rely on gore or affects it will not age.<br /> All of this movie is a piece of art rather than simply fiction, beautifully unleashing a tragic and brutal story of a powerful, cryptic haunting that had always been there but was just waiting to be let out.ion even more effective, causing the hotel itself and the surroundings to seem more closed in, smaller, tighter spaces.<br /><br />For the hotel itself the inside shots were great, but the outside shots were just as effective.

B002VISN9E|2.0|I read this to see what Tim Minchin is working with as composer and lyricist in the London musical production.  Though I have previously been thrilled by this author and his writing I found this tale to be dark, depressing and very nasty. Its punctuation was first class!
B002QCD2OG|2.0|Sergeant Howie travels to the Scottish island of Sumerisle to investigate the disappearance of a young girl. Once he arrives, however, he's not met with cooperation. Everyone is claiming that the girl didn't exist, even the child's own mother. The sergeant refuses to be put off, though, and as he continues his investigation he discovers more and more strange inconsistencies. He even witnesses bizarre orgy type deals going down. Can the detective find the girl in time, or else her body, are are islanders being truthful after all?<br /><br />The Wicker Man is a creative endeavor exploiting a unique take on the pagan religion and culture. It has several things going for it, including an amazing script that stands as shocking, thriller, and filled with well laid and subtle clues by scriptwriter Anthony Shaffer. The more viewings uncover more layers and hints of what's co come. The Wicker man also attempts a chilling sense of realism and was clearly researched well. The film is gifted with an enticing soundtrack, and director Robin Hardy managed to due an admirable job with the miniscule budget he had to work with. Acting wise every does their job well, including Lord Summerisle, played by the late Christopher Lee. It begins as an intriguing mystery, the ending is a wicked, stunning finale, and the middle is chocked to the brim with queasy, bizarre situations.<br /><br />A major theme is the religious controversy and inner struggles of Sgt. Howie, played tremendously well by Edward Woodward. The strong morals and religious concepts Sgt. Howie acts as a complimentary difference between the plots role. It's difficult for the main character to understand the different actions and beliefs of the other characters, yet he does try and ignore it and just focus on the investigation for the time being. The film raises some strong questions about the nature of religious beliefs in general and the clashes of culture.<br /><br />Problems I do have with this film is that the portrayal of this particular pagan religion is not one of worshiping nature and the motto of not harming life. The islanders have seem instead to have a lack of appreciation for value, life, and for the opinions of others, forming a chilling sort of cult instead of just private worship. They take and destroy and use for their own means only, disregarding another's belief. The lead Christian character was shocked and dismayed at their actions, yet he was not the one imposing beliefs or taking unwarranted steps to warrant his own views. Howie may appear a bit stiff at times, and certainly as judgmental, but he does stand as the only one who seems to have a clear sense of morality, right and wrong, and the general laws.<br /><br />I believe people will get dissimilar things from this one. On one hand they may walk away happy that another alternate religion reigned supreme, others may screw their mouths up in disgust at the pagan outlook portrayed, and yet others may see it as actually a sign of what happens when people do walk away from Christianity. Yet more may just see it as the dangers of cults, having one leader, and brainwashing. All different perceptions from different backgrounds and different people, and all right.<br /><br />While Christopher Lee and Edward Woodward performed their roles well, some of the acting was rather wooden and off. While the film is thought provoking, its shocking ending did not aptly wrap up the story and drive the story home with more than just dread and a feeling of unpleasant emptiness. The pace is rather slow and I found myself drifting off at a few parts. More excitement injected between good scenes would be welcome. Ekland was unable to form a decent Scottish accent, so the dubbing of her voice grew tiresome and distracting. There are also many songs in this one, almost like it's half musical, and many aren't that good.<br /><br />However, it does stand as an excellent example of the dangers of strong belief in only your religion. It has been said that religion is the root of all great good and all great evil. This film portrays this as well as any other. It is certainly worth a watch and has now become a cult classic well revered by many.s been said that religion is the root of all great good and all great evil.

B0002KQNL8|1.0|I have a confession to make. I have not seen the original Return of the Living Dead. I've read in a few sources that it is the superior film, and judging from the way nature seems to work with originals and their sequels, this doesn't surprise me. I came in with the second flick, which obviously wanted to be a comedy and tried overly hard. Let's just say I don't have fond memories of it.<br />The basic plot goes something like this: A mess from the first film has been left behind by sloppy soldiers during a half ass clean up. Some of the undead of course rise and wreak havok. The 'rise' is hilariously lame that has 'Thriller' video written all over it. I'm all for spoofing other horror pieces but this was too tacky to fit. From then on out some kids and their dates try to stop the madness before they end up a zombie snack.<br /><br />I've said it before and I'll say it again. Horror and comedy is an unstable balance that needs to be weighed carefully. I love humorous horror films that are done well, for they are an art form of their own and can provide unlimited entertainment. Here, though, they executed the process the wrong way - big time - and instead we get left with sloppy leftovers that deserve to discarded instead of eaten.<br /><br />First, the scenes were so over the top and corny cheesiness doesn't even begin to describe it. Instead of ripping smiles out of me, they ripped out groans and disappointment. Even the zombies themselves were jokes and idiotic; they could perhaps have had this a saving grace if the characters weren't so bad, but if you're rooting for BOTH the villains and the heroes to be destroyed, you're just not having that good of a time.<br /><br />The acting was deliberately bad to be 'funny'. Didn't work. Jesse as the main character was beyond irritating and I didn't warm up to him one bit.  He was played by Michael Kenworthy who I suppose did well enough but it's hard to tell with the material. Ed, played by James Karen, was more amusing in a solid way but I still didn't click with him. A real annoyance was the slutty, low IQ female, Lucy, played by Marsha Dietlin. Her acting was so overdone it's too burnt to enjoy. The rest didn't win any awards either...unless they're for bad efforts.<br /><br />Direction is basic, and the effects low budget and unappealing. Zombies looked weak, but some of the 'killing/death' effects were OK. The score wasn't anything to drool over, although it wasn't horrendous. It relied on heavier 80's type music to match the cheese. Unlike The Lost Boys and various horror carnival rides, it didn't earn brownie points here for that choice. One of the huge sore thumbs sticking out is the horrendous, dopey dialogue. It's obvious the actors were encouraged to ham it up and over do things, so I suppose most of the hate letters I'll be sending should be addressed to the director.<br /><br />The only ones I'd recommend this to would be die hard zombie fans, people who enjoy the truly cheesy, awful movies, or those that are fans of any of the actors. Otherwise, pass and try something on for size that fits better. There are plenty of other zombie movies out there, humorous ones included, that are a hell of lot better than this crap.in a solid way but I still didn't click with him.

B0046B4VXQ|4.0|Meet Carrie. A homely, quiet and timid young girl with a religious zealot for a mother, encountering abuse from all sides and completely discluded from her classmates and the high schools' social cliches.<br /><br /> But Carrie has a terrifying power -- the supernatural gift Telekinesis. She can move things with her mind. And now she's been invited to the prom...<br /><br /> Carrie is a interesting and somewhat psychological thriller that came from one of the most popular horror authors ever, as well as from the mastermind who directed the classic with Al Pacino, \\"Scarface\\", and the homage-to-Hitchcock thriller \\"Sisters\\".<br /><br /> Many themes are discussed in this film -- from teenage cruelty, social cliches, extreme religion, abuse. DePalma makes sure we sympathize with the girl on all levels, but the movie is not shown in only a one-person point of view. We also see through the eyes of naughty teenagers, coaches, teachers and parents, as well as anyone else relevant to the plot. In summary we know exactly what is going on --even if Carrie herself doesn't--and this clever direction makes us enjoy the plot more.<br /><br /> If we didn't know the pig blood plot before we saw it splash onto the main character, most likely we wouldn't have been paying attention to the movie while we sat there for five minutes trying to figure out just where the hell all that blood came from. And of course the other characters don't know about Carrie White's unique gifts -- to our delight but their disadvantage.<br /><br /> Sissy Spacek was completely convincing in her role and manages to make sure we can see Carrie as a real person. Piper Laurie is very eerie and downright crazy as the half-witted mother.<br /><br /> William Katt (House) is an excellent actor in every role I've seen him in and it's a shame he hasn't graced the screen more. John Travolta? As usual he played his part well. The cast had great chemistry throughout.<br /><br /> We have plenty of character development and this is always a good thing, but Carrie herself was a bit too wimpy and whiny for my tastes. Sure, in the end she comes out of her shell in a startling way, but more in an act of anger than anything else. And of course I was rooting for her actions the entire time. But for the majority of the movie she was a bit too pitiful and there was just nothing there for substance. Her mother Margaret White was a nut -- that much is certain -- and her scenes with Carrie added some great conflict, but overall a wee bit flat.<br /><br /> Thankfully the final act was pure genious and left a nice unsettled feeling in the stomach.this is always a good thing, but Carrie herself was a bit too wimpy and whiny for my tastes.

B000YFYOAS|4.0|This movie starts with a seemingly ill man going into a blood bank to make a transaction. It becomes clear the \\"workers\\" are really sadistic vampires out for an easy meal but they soon have the surprise of their life -  death is only seconds away. The brief glimpse of this man is the first showing we get of who will be the true villian in the film.<br /><br /> Blades new partner is a brainy young man who I thought would be a key player but after the beginning he's really not focused on a whole lot. Blade and his crew are summoned to a vampire meeting where they are told help is needed. Blades worst enemy - the vampires - now need his aide to wipe out a new superbreed of demonic vamps.<br /><br />These are worse than the original - creepy as hell looking, resistant to silver and garlic, and are cursed with an insatiable appetite. Once they devour the vamps they'll turn to the humans for food. One bite from these things to a human being or another vampire will turn the victim into the villian. Before realizing this Blade didn't care, but now he is forced to join the undead army.<br /><br /> While Blade doesn't trust the vampires as far as he can throw them (which is pretty far) he agrees to the plan and meets a special task unit that have been training for 2 years. They are equipped with their own arsenal and fighting techniques; one of the 2 main characters from the group is the daughter of the vampire \\"president\\". The second is bald, buff dude Dieter Reinhardt (Ron Perlman) who has a major attitude and played on Alien Resurrection with about the same personality.<br /><br /> The plot is easy to follow. It's more about action (like the first). Since the new breed is harder to kill, they have to get pretty damn creative in their choices of slaughter. Blade doesn't seem as tragic and disturbed as he was in the first, and in a way seems more at peace with himself.<br /><br /> The CGI is outstanding and used all the time. The blood continously splashes on screen. The gore is high; obviously the MPAA looked the other way.<br /><br /> We also have more insight into the vampire characters. While in part 1 they were simply shown as evil little things, here we find some decent ones. Showing killing as a survival technique that must be done, not something enjoyed. this is something the original lacked a bit, this one improving upon.<br /><br /> The ending was stunning and sad, and then ending with laughter and another light note.<br /><br /> If you enjoyed the first, take a bite out of this one, for it's just as tasty, if not better.e is high; obviously the MPAA looked the other way.<br /><br /> We also have more insight into the vampire characters.

B000SW2F80|3.0|With all the built up hype surrounding Creepshow I was a little dismayed to find it suffered from what so many other short story gigs do: the first stories were horrible!<br /><br /> But before we get down to the dissection of this piece, I wanted to point out some selective slices. Stephen King and George A. Romero, the master behind the pen and the master behind the camera, are in charge of this compilation where they delve into the 50s EC type comic books and head out to overdo everything (intentionally). Tom Savini pops up to do some overall gnarly effects. In between stories (and through them) we get neat little reminders this is all comic style. From the cool opening to some story scenes switching from movie reel to comic cut outs.<br /><br />The first story wasn't as clever as the layout. Titled father's day it's pointless -- about a man coming from the grave to eat his cake and kill his family. The story doesn't make any sense. Why and how did he raise and why does he wish to kill everyone? This little skit stars Ed Harris who plays out an amusing little dance that's a riot to watch. But the plot just isn't that interesting. Pretty flat and doesn't really satisfy on any level.<br /><br /> The second stars King himself as an ignorant farmer where a meteor lands in his yard and causes everything to grow into a plant. Including him. Nothing happens except we watch a guy turn into a bush and have flashbacks of his father. King's personality is goofy and while he does well for him he need's to stick from books and keep his face on the back covers of his bestsellers.<br /><br /> Three times again a charm as we pick up and are shown why this obtained a cult following. Leslie Nielsen and Ted Dansen star in a love/revenge morbid tale where Niesel designs a clever torturing way of death for both Dansen and his cheating wife.<br /><br /> We wrap with two more tales. One being a werewolf segment involving a man who wants to feed his bitchy wife to the created creature. This one's funny and you can't help but sympathize with the poor guy as his wife really is bad. The finale is every person who has a cockroach persons nightmare. This isn't scary at all but it's amusing/fun for some of the stories.This one's funny and you can't help but sympathize with the poor guy as his wife really is bad.

B00D3LA5WG|2.0|I fell asleep while watching this movie and not because I was tired.<br /><br />To me I found this movie one of the most boring Movies I have ever seen with few likable moments. There is one action scene that lasts about 10 minutes at most.<br /><br />Witherspoon has a small part and does not even show up for the first hour of this over two hour movie.<br /><br />I found no one likable in reality in the entire movie.<br /><br />In all honesty I cannot understand any of the positive reviews.
B0089BSM70|4.0|During the 80's slasher craze it would have been a miracle for a successful horror film not to have its sequel. Michael Myers was made into an icon of fright overnight and would forever imprint his expressionless face into the hearts of many; as a result, the fans screamed for more relentless carnage and they got it, in its flawed but magnificent form, on the morning after the first fateful Halloween night.<br />Intended more as a continuation of the first series of events, the viewer is left seeing Loomis stare at the ground in horror, seeing only small specks of blood where Myers corpse should lay. Meanwhile, Laurie Strode is being rushed to the hospital, while reports of the madman on the loose have been released to the small town. Michael continues on his murderous rampage while the sheriff discovers, with Loomis, that his only child is one of the victims. Loomis stays determined to find the killer - who he swears is still somehow alive - and with the help of an upset deputy, ends up making situations much worse. At the hospital Laurie meets Jimmy, a paramedic close to her own age, who befriends her and exchanges harmless teenage flirting. Like Loomis, Laurie's convinced Myers is still alive, and begins making plans to protect herself. Of course the viewer knows the two are right and we sit back to witness various examples of senseless slaughter, silly teenage bantering, and gratuitous nudity.<br /><br />Halloween 2 is a more than worthy sequel, not only rehashing much of what worked in the original formula, but expanding it by widening Myers killing circle and his motivations. The script is peppered with a bit more raunchy, ridiculous seasoning, but it does introduce some clever backstory. The connection between Strode and Myers was an interesting one to invent, and it is that familial connection that enabled more sequels to be produced. One could argue that the lack of reasoning behind Myers madness is one of the things that worked so well with Halloween, however, and that trying to explain things away - albeit clumsily - in the second go around only muddled the waters a bit. I'm not sure yet how I stand on the issue - I would have dug both methods, I think - but I don't try to put too much brain power into it.<br /><br />While the first movie had a hint of newness about it, the second just continued something fans had already fell in love with, not able to break any more new ground. Although some of the shock had worn off by the time a sequel shows its head, they thankfully kept Michael the same (unlike the Nightmare on Elm Series with the dismissal part 2), keeping his killing style similar to the first. One thing different was that the gore was laid on thicker, making it seem more of a standard slasher film than its predecessor. In the original little gore was used and Carpenter attempted suspense without trying to shock. In the second the director wasn't happy with Rosenthals version being scary enough, and went in to add some more violence/gore himself - the hot tub scene, the razor blade apple, the nurse-needle-eye - which is a bit to a contradiction, but oh well.<br /><br />Suspense is built as in the first one, but with a different style from director Rosenthal. The man IS talented, I almost bit my knuckle off when Laurie was on the ground outside trying to distract her potential help! Mood is still grim,  heavy, and harrowing. If he would only have spruced up some of the slower scenes, he would have been nearly perfect. Alan Howarth reworked the original score a bit, giving it more of an 80's electric vibe, and while it didnt carry the same terror as it did before, it worked well here and was used wisely. Who doesn't start getting excited when they hear this score now?<br /><br /> I didn't find Halloween too slow, but I enjoyed how part 2 picked up the pace a bit. In the first film Michael stayed more in the shadows, yet here since the cat's already been let out of the bag they don't mind giving him a little more spot light. The kills were a little more creative, although flash doesn't always out-equal class. I really got into the flashbacks Laurie had - they were trippy and beautiful at the same time, strange - and more of those would have been welcomed. Good, unexpected move there. As in the original, the final showdown between predator and prey was phenomenal. Plenty of suspense and chills, ending with a small twist of irony.<br /><br />For the bad, the script is just too damn slow in some parts. It's actually boring for a few minutes here and there, especially blabber with the staff. There was a mood about these scenes that induced more yawns than interest from yours truly, although I can't really put my finger on why. There were also holes and inconsistencies galore - too many to be ignored for fans - that irritated. This hospital had to be one of the more bare hospitals in existence, with only one security guard and basically zero patients. Phones and lights don't work, people leave doors open to hear patients if they call for help, the newborns seemed to have spontaneously reproduced with no parents around, and the ease of breaking in and murdering in the halls is ludicrous. Introducing the backstory of Druidism didn't  make a lick of sense and seemed to be reaching too much. It's clear the scriptwriter was grabbing his head and trying to think of something to add to the 'story.' Didn't work, sorry.<br /><br />Halloween worked so well for so many reasons, and even though it holds its baskets of holes, Halloween 2 tried hard to live up to expectations. Faster at times, maintaining some of the originals suspense, and delivered with a more vicious, bloody knife, it had to let go of some plausibility and follow more of a formula. Overall a more than fun sequel to the original, continuing the reign of terror through that small town Haddonfield, by a killer who would later be called \\"The Shape.\\"e spot light.

B001WBNZ6W|3.0|The Kite Runner was a far superior book .  I was drawn into the story and didn't want to let it go.  This book was predictable.
B001609SQA|5.0|With the high profit margin of the original Alien, it was inevitable that Fox would release a sequel. Following in the afterglow with The Terminator, James Cameron did the smart thing, not trying to outdo the original but instead directing a different beast altogether. Aliens is a film chocked full of big guns, big machines, big language, and even bigger deaths.<br /><br />Lt. Ripley and her cat, frozen in hypersleep, are found 57 years after the destruction of the Nostromo. Finding out upon her return that her normal life span has been spent, her daughter is dead, and that there is nothing left for her, she has more problems than just recovering from the recent nightmares endured. Due to lack of evidence supporting her claims of what befell the Nostromo and all expensive equipment, she is relinquished from her responsibilities and her ICC license as a Commercial flight officer is revoked. As a result of her trauma she is now depressed and having therapy (recommended by the company, of course), along with sweat-filled dreams. Sounds like great fun.<br /><br /> Since her absence, colonies of human families have been set up on LV-426, the planet she barely escaped from alive. When contact is mysteriously cut-off, she is invited to return along with a horde of super-tough marines to check out the \\"problem.\\" Feeling trapped and unsure, she ventures along as an advisor, only to find her worst nightmare has come true...again. Once there they trace the tracking devices implanted in the humans, and discover a huge alien hive, with most of the Terraformers cocooned. The protecting aliens are awakened and attack swiftly, offing half of the marines. From then on out, Ripley knows the reality is even grimmer than before, and likely wishes she had stayed behind rather than trekking along for this suicidal ride. She befriends a lone survivor, Nute, a little girl whose family has been massacred and who Ripley is now determined to protect.<br /><br />Let it be said that Aliens is an amazing, inspiring flick - charged with big guns, nearly non-stop action, incredible casting, breathtaking cinematography, one of the best music scores ever made, freaky as hell creatures, a great plot - and furthering upon the terror of the original Alien. The bodies start flying and the heart starts racing as they realize their error on landing on the planet they now cannot escape from.<br /><br /> I would probably drop dead if someone announced they found the acting bad in this movie. Sigourney Weaver returns as Lt. Ripley badder than ever; this woman has the balls to make the movie work, and again is convincing as hell in her fear, her anger, her frustration. She's a bit hardened around the edges this time around, and as always only adds to the film, never taking away. This time we get a friendly \\"artificial human\\" (as he likes to be called), played by the wondrous Lance Henriksen. Michael Biehn is the sexy and likeable Cpl. Dwayne Hicks, I'm pleased with him the whole way through. The rest of the cast includes Paul Reiser as Burke (an unlikable character but a fantastic actor), Bill Paxton as private Hudson to add large doses of humor and up the suspense level - have to love this guy - Jenette Goldstein as Vasquez (Near Dark) is a tough rebellious woman who adds her own personal charm, among many others. Again you're made to care about all the characters and mourn when they lose the battle.<br /><br />There's more than one Alien this time folks (hence the plural) and it used to the top advantage by Cameron. \\"They're coming out of the walls!\\" The score was so sensational that ever since it has been used in other movies and trailers. Every Alien film has been creepy -- it's hard for them not to be. Here is no different. The scene where the soldiers have first gone out to investigate is both tragic and unforgettable. The feeling of desperation, isolation and entrapment, fear and confusion really shines through. There's plenty of scenes where you're left wondering what the hell's going to happen, and which person's going to bite the big one next. Definitely watch with the lights out!<br /><br /> I found part one more frightening, while two tended to rely more on being action-packed. Many people compare the films but they really should stand on their own. They involve the same thing but the atmosphere in both is different enough to stop unjust checklists on which has more of this and which has more of that.<br /><br /> Overall a sequel that must be seen. Alien and Aliens are both one-of-a-kind and every movie goer should give them a chance.g what the hell's going to happen, and which person's going to bite the big one next.

B00153ZC8Q|5.0|The Terminator begins with 2 beings coming from the future through a lightning/energy technique. One of them is a human being (who manages to be hot as hell), and the other is a buff, no s*** taking, assassin cyborg (who manages to be completely naked). The robot from hell has been sent to destroy a young woman who will later get pregnant and give birth to a male that will become an enemy of machines.  In the future once they have taken over, he will lead the fight against them. The other man is a more soft hearted soul that comes from that time when the world has been destroyed, yet he was sent by the son as an adult that right now is not yet born or even conceived, to save his mother so she can have him. Capiche? Good.<br />The Terminator is a film that is highly coated with style, morbid moments and pure delicious destruction - I love it! In the Terminator series, this one's my favorite, and yes I know I stand out from the crowd in saying that. Curious as to why? Read my review of Terminator 2 for explanation. While the second boasted some clever humor and a bonding between robot and child, here we have as simple fathering of kill and run, kill and fight, or be destroyed. Pure adrenaline heaven. Besides all this we get a nice little love story on the side, a tragedy that would rival a Shakespeare story, and true endearing human emotion.<br /><br />My favorite aspect of this movie is that it's bleak as hell. The scene that stands out the most is when  Biehn's character, Reese, is recounting how in the future they are able to sniff out robots by using dogs. The scene where the dogs started barking and they just knew their hiding hole has been found was creepy as hell. Great directing there, and  just one reason I hold the first terminator close to my heart.<br /><br />Arnold is at the top of his game. You can tell he's putting his all into this role (and showing it all!) Linda Hamilton is sweet and reluctant, playing the role up to a helm.  Biehn is gorgeous and also shows us the right side of him when it counts. There were some truly enjoyable small parts for unknowns back then, such as Bill Paxton with the blue hair, Lance Henriksen as a cop, and Dick Miller discussing home defense. Great gathering!<br /><br />If any flaws exist, it's that the effects look rather cheesy with today's standards. However, I think having a lower budget helped this movie more than it hurt. (How familiar is that saying lately?) It's always true it seems. You have to wok with more creativity when you less cash to pass around.<br /><br />The eclectic score from Brad Fiedel is amazing; it's heart pounding and perfectly tuned into the flick. The relationship between Hamilton and  Biehn ups this from being just another action film. I classify it as horror as that's in there -- it's a great, almost seamless blend of several genres (sci-fi, horror, action, drama, romance)<br /><br />Overall an amazing movie that shouldn't be missed. The Terminator is now an American icon of sorts, as it  should be. Let's just hope that the message behind this film doesn't come true as we keep advancing toward technology at an alarming rate, not looking before we leap and considering the potential ramifications. The social commentary is both true and well received by yours truly. I read an article recently where they are using computer chips and human brain cells together. It's scary how when these movies come out their plots seem ludicrous, yet one day horror may prove it's clairvoyant after all.t side of him when it counts.

B001LX2J22|3.0|In the nineties and beyond, a flame grew in the hearts of Americans: the undeniable obsession with everything serial killer. After the hypnotizing Silence of the Lambs, the creepy but slightly off-the-kilter Hannibal, the series spread its wings even wider and gave us Red Dragon.<br /><br />Instead of furthering upon the past two plot lines, it rewinded a bit and laid out what unfolded pre-Jody Foster obsessions. FBI investigator Will Graham goes by hunches. Hunches that seem to have odd psychic twists. One particular hunch enables him to be the only soul lucky alive to nab Hannibal-the-cannibal Lecter. While almost losing his life in the process, Will goes on to eventual retirement while our favorite psychiatrist ends up in a place where only his worst patients would live.<br /><br />Another nutty killer comes along to drag the retired detective from his garden while Lecter is busily fuming in his cell, dreaming of bringing down the man who announced to the world that he was criminally insane. While my obsession with serial killers doesn't run that deep, Lecter's character is fascinating. Especially through Harris' novels. In Red Dragon, though, Lecter's time is pretty scarce considering the series is basically surrounding him. But when he is shown, his presence is both strongly felt and relished. I would have liked to see more of him, but forgave them that for the plot they gave us.<br /><br />Francis is a decent enough psychopath, less annoying than Jamie in Silence, and they explore a lot more of his psyche than they did in the previous. They show spots of him in his life, what pushes him over, why he does what he does, blah blah blah. His tattoo is...unique, and a bit overdone in terms of plot, but otherwise fine. The ending with him took me by surprise, so I give the creators credit for that. Ralph Fiennes stars as the role, and he does an admirable job. Edward Norton as Will is well casted, bringing life to the character.<br /><br />Of course there are some kills, a particular brutal burning man standing out as a victim. Much of the violence is implied, or shot half heartedly, or not shown at all but just mentioned.<br /><br />Even though this movie doesn't stand out in the crowd, it's better than Hannibal, carrying on violence and drama similar to Silence of the Lambs. While Silence is still the superior, this one deserves a look.ills, a particular brutal burning man standing out as a victim.

B0002O7XW2|4.0|It's ironic Stephen King was hit by a van a few years back (because the woman was distracted by her St. Bernard no less) since he seems to enjoy sneaking vehicles into his movies. In Cujo two people are trapped in a car that got them in the situation in the first place by breaking down. In Pet Semetary a devestating death takes place because of a large semi. In Sometimes they Come back, the situation could have been prevented if it wasn't for not finding car keys to get out of the way of the train. And then there's the more direct approaches...Trucks, Maximum Overdrive, and finally...Christine.<br /><br /> Adapted to the screen by one of the most impressive directors alive, John Carpenter, this picture circles around the plot of a posessed, obsessive, vindictive Female 58 Plymouth named Christine. Christine herself has definite personality and comes across as convincingly alive.<br /><br /> Arnie (Keith Gordon), a socially inept teenage boy with parents you just want to slap and one friend, finds his dream in an old run down automobile at an old man's house. Paying no mind the cars condition, he promptly buys the hunk of evil metal and proceeds to put everything he's worth into it. Dennis (John Stockwell) plays Arnie's best friend John, who never quite feels right about Christine and is slowly isolated from Arnie as his personality completely alters. The other main role is Leigh (Alexandra Paul) who was briefly Annie's girl and comes out as one of the only female competitors of Christine that lives. So far.<br /><br /> Arnie gets a job at a car shop to work on Christine, and builds her up to almost brand new. He's having trouble with some bullies at school though, and they take their revenge out on his most prized posession. He and Christine start plotting on how to get even.<br /><br /> The movie doesn't have blood or gore, really, and the scare factor is missing, but it's still entertaining. After Leigh becomes increasingly jealous of the time Arnie spends on his car, she sees Christines dark side real fast and the two lovebirds break it off. Her and Dennis get together to discuss the fears they have about their friend and through research on the car's history, come to a conclusion that I won't spoil.<br /><br /> Carpenters slick visuals are all there and I saw some brilliant direction (especially the scene where Arnie stands in front of the car and asks to see what she's got) but like King himself, I found this movie a little lackluster. Arnie's change is almost overnight, a tad too quick for plausibility. A car can only get so creative in the way it slaughters once it's gone wacko so that's gets a little old.<br /><br /> In the end, the theme of killers cars isn't really my cup of tea, but hey, this flick's not boring and has realistic characters. All act well and are explored deeply enough to be cared about. Great music accompanies the highlights, and some superb suspenseful bits are woven in through Carpenter's camera magic.car, she sees Christines dark side real fast and the two lovebirds break it off.

B004SJUB8A|3.0|Very similar to Rosemary's Baby in terms of the execution (read: snail pace build up) Astronaut's Wife offers an older story with a newer twist. Spencer Armacost and his partner goes on into space to repair a satellite when contact is lost with them for two minutes. After that they are recovered but upon returning to Earth, the partner dies of a heart attack, his wife kills herself, Spencer Armacost's wife Jillian becomes pregnant, and the couple moves. Fun times eh?<br /><br />Skip forward through a few boring parts, and you have the wife Jillian becoming paranoid that her husband may not be quite right. The hormone laden woman notices hubby's new bedroom roughness and other little clues that make her wonder whether her husband as she knew him is now gone, or whether the pregnancy is breaking her mind. Sound familiar?<br /><br />Surprisingly enough, and despite lukewarm reception, The Astronaut's Wife is a clever enough tale with more than competent acting and decent direction. The plot is outlandish, strange, and, while not offering horror fans too much of a different taste to their usual meal, it still makes sure the heart keeps kicking during certain scenes. While the script holds potential, weaknesses lie around many corners eager to bring the viewer down a couple of notches. Director (and scriptwriter)  Rand Ravich has fun behind the camera, utilizing some nifty shots, especially when Jillian becomes panicked and the camera starts whirling around.<br /><br />As always Johnny Depp does his very best, bringing Spencer to life as a sexy, dangerous being; Jillian, played by the gorgeous and endearing Charlene Theron, fits into her role like it's a second skin. All acting is more than competent; I could find no faults in this department.<br /><br />The main flaw that stands out is that the viewer knows very early on what has happened, and instead of much of the film being spent in suspense, it's in annoyance for the lead to hurry the hell up and figure it out. The ending is powerful, but still a bit off, and the final wrap up just doesn't' hold water. How the hell does this rapid change in her make sense??<br /><br />I recommend giving it a try but not shelling out the dough for the DVD without seeing it first. It's nothing new, and there's nothing earth shattering here, but it's something to put on and drool over.<br /><br />After all, if everything else fails, we could always just watch the movie for the gorgeous actors alone.ending is powerful, but still a bit off, and the final wrap up just doesn't' hold water.

B00F91RYL8|3.0|Slow, uneventful, nearly boring.  I was expecting ...what was it...a pulse pounding epic...not even close.  Nothing original in this, nothing scary, nothing pulse pounding at all. The acting was O.K., but I guess I'm really just over Brad Pitt.
B000HF0J36|3.0|Seeing how well people reacted to seeing a shark in the water during JAWS, it was only inevitable that there would be multiple copycats (or should I say copysharks?) being fished out. Thankfully this one doesn't end up being half bad and manages to stay afloat most of the time.<br /><br /> Some of the characters are actually pretty interesting. Dr. Susan McAlester is one of them (sort-of). She's been doing experiments on sharks in the hopes of finding a cure for Alzheimer's. The theory is since their brains don't age they can be of some help for us less fortunite humans. But she ignores the warning signs of the sharks becoming TOO smart, and this later comes and bites her in the ass when the founder Russell Franklin (Samuel L. Jackson!) pays a visit.<br /><br /> There are three sharks in total. Pretty plain looking in color, they're not great whites or anything, but they have big teeth, are large, fast, and mean as hell. Plenty of CGI is used when they're there, and overall it's not too unrealistic.<br /><br /> They are housed in a walled in water container. In the middle of this confinement is the research lab, which houses the employees. They even have a watchtower/look out.<br /><br /> Accompanied by the main dr. are some folks who help out which the sharks, notably a shark wrestler type guy named Carter (Thomas Jane) who was in trouble for something involving the large predators in the past. We also have a preacher/worker (LL Cool J) who is hilarious and I devoured his scenes. The doc Susan (Saffron Burrows) is as cold as the fish she takes care of but shows a somewhat thawed heart later on.<br /><br /> When the first attack occurs (in a pretty shocking, brutal and bloody fashion), there is a massive explosion. The damage is done and their safe haven starts filling up with water! They have to get to the tops but the sharks are hungry and on their trail. We have some juicy tension going down, some pretty good kills and quick shocks, a decent helping of blood and body parts, and the count of shark victims is plentiful.<br /><br /> This movie may seem redundant but it's not always predictable. I recommend giving it a go to see if it agrees with your stomach.body parts, and the count of shark victims is plentiful.<br /><br /> This movie may seem redundant but it's not always predictable.

B001AITH50|2.0|Interview with the vampire was based on the mega seller with the same name by the gothic styled author Anne Rice. Being a big hit for the fans, many scripts were rejected before she finally decided to give in on this one. Some key points of IWTV are very daring but I'll discuss them below.<br /> The plot is simple yet it's also not. No classic vampire tale here, folks. \\"It's fun to be a vampire\\" is proven to be a lie. Instead the more realistic outlook is taken. Living centuries through death and massive change must take a toll on the mind. Taking blood and killing to sustain ones existence robs one of 'life'. Through the ages the human side slowly dissolves, and you grow colder despite the warmth of your 'drink', until one day everything about you that existed before is dead and won't be coming back.<br /><br />So goes the woes of the main character, Louis, who spends the movie mourning his existence. He was a depressed human being and once brought to the other side by Lestat, not much changes. Some light in his life is brought with the birth of Claudia, but even that doesn't last, as the viewer is sure to know.<br /><br />The depressed vamp wafts through the ages full of sorrow and regret, never enveloping the onster he has to be. His creator, Lestat, long ago accepted the killer mode (in fact, embraced it), and is shown for the majority of the first half of the long flick. The big shocker here is all are played by big names, not something usual for a horror picture.  Brad Pitt oozes sex appeal as Louis and mourns like no one else. His bare chest, long hair, and deep green eyes is enough to make me pop in this flick. Tom Cruise kicks out the comedy and action roles to play a conniving, twisted vampire longing for a companion. While his character was not as 'nice', it was the most addictive. Antonio Banderas stars as the long haired, overly pale Armando.<br /><br />Claudia...well, everyone seems to love her. I didn't. Kirsten Dunst has Claudia written all over her, yet her character annoyed me to no end. I don't care about her being a child vampire, her actions came off spoiled and bitter. Sure, I can understand to a point, and even sympathize, but overall she came off as a manipulative little bitch who thought only of herself. Lestat may have been 'hardened', but I didn't see him display the capability for cruelty that this little child did.<br /><br />The film is absolutely riveting, and if I could think of just one word to describe it, I'd choose this one: beautiful. Beautiful colors, beautiful scenery, beautiful music, beautiful dialogue, beautiful clothing, beautiful men. Through the ages we see everything in a Gothic, polished style. The clothing, manner, and poise of the characters sent me senses reeling. It cannot be said for many horror films, or movies in any genre, that the environment is this darn 'pretty.'<br /><br />Elliot Goldenthall's music score for the film is amazing and helped enriched what all the film represents: beauty, betrayal, hunger, rage, and loss. I've played the soundtrack countless times, all of them being classical except one (Sympathy for the devil.) The music inspires me like no other instrumental collection ( so far ).<br /><br />Pacing wise, the movie's a trifle slow. Eventful but in that lazy, lethargic manner that allows character development. Overall a bleak and grey existence for everyone in the end, and the film certainly takes the time to let the viewer know this. For a vampire flick the violence isn't extreme, but it counts as a realistic gesture once shown. Some cruel (particularly the tortured woman over the coffin), but none of the 'splatter -mainstream' stuff seen in Lost Boys or Near Dark.<br /><br />The ending is dark, bleak, but fit the rest of the production perfectly. It's hard to imagining a horror fan not liking this film at all, but I can understand how Louis's whining can grate on the nerves. He overdoes it at times and after awhile you just want the guy to get drunk andtake a few prozacs, find a hot woman, and take a vacation. Surely there's something in life to be found somewhere for him! I also mourned the loss of Lestat in the second half, as he really spiced things up more. He had a sick, ironic humor and made things a bit more exciting. When he vanished, so did some of the entertainment value. When he does show up again, there are several gaping questions left hanging in the air concerning him.<br /><br />So, obviously this movie is far from perfect. Not all the characters were sympathetic. However, it's still more than worth a watch and a gorgeous piece of horror cinema that remains faithful to the book, showcasing all the genuine human emotion and angst.take a few prozacs, find a hot woman, and take a vacation.

B00471TLZS|5.0|Well-done original ghost stories are among the best forms of horror. This is certainly one of those movies that demonstrated that there has always been that fear of the unknown but when it's in your house, after your children, it's always that more terrifying.<br /><br /> We have geniouses behind this masterpiece. Stephen Spielberg as the director/producer has already proven he could build terror in Jaws and proves it again with this. Tobe Hooper (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre) is the producer/director as well although there is some dispute over where to lend the credit. Spielberg actually wrote the story and screenplay himself, which surprised me a little as I always thought he was just the director for awhile.<br /><br /> But enough with movie politics. Steve is a successful realtor, and with his wife Diane, daughter Carol Anne, teenager Dana, and son Robby, they all live in the Freeling house. A 2 story but not overly huge home in your typical suburban surroundings.<br /><br /> Carol Anne is the main star and she's as cute as a button. We instantly fall in love with her. She is just too precious and it was a wide decision casting her as the focal point. The acting could NOT be improved upon. JoBeth Williams and Craig T. Nelson really hold it together.<br /><br /> At first when haunting incidents occure (accompanied with beautiful sound effects/music and perfect anything else) they're just exciting for the mother and daughter duo while they freak out the father. One night during a thunderstorm a tree comes to life, breaks through the childrens window, and grabs Robbie. Distracting the parents, Carol Anne is summoned to the TV, where she is sucked into a ghostly type of void.<br /><br /> The family then goes through sheer hell to try and get her back - including hiring a quirky parapsychological ghostbuster Tangina.<br /><br /> This movie has some really wierd parts like where the ghosts are filmed coming down the stairs or the toy clown from under the bed. And, just when you think it's alright in this movie, something else seems to happen.<br /><br /> If I look deep enough I can uncover some minor faults. One is the boy. He's not the worst actor but he irritates me, especially the scene where he's freaking out about his sister in the TV. It's..irritating. But other than that, nothing much.<br /><br /> Great ending, great beginning, great cast, great suspense, great plot all equal Poltergiest. A hell of a ghost movie that you should have seen by now. If not, shame on you!when you think it's alright in this movie, something else seems to happen.<br /><br /> If I look deep enough I can uncover some minor faults. One is the boy.

0553296981|5.0|It was impossible for me not to feel a heavy heart when I closed this book. I think the last quote in the afterword sums it up perhaps the best - \\"Her voice was preserved,\\" Ernst Schnabel wrote, \\"out of the millions that were silenced, this voice no louder than a child's whisper....It has outlasted the shouts of the murderers and has soared above the voices of time.\\"<br /><br />Anne Frank was an amazingly courageous, determined, and free-spirited young woman. Her dreams of growing up and becoming a published writer, her fascination with Hollywood, her animosity and feelings of difference from her mother...all marked her as many teenaged girls are marked. Yet her strength in the simple things such as looking outside the dirty, dusty window at the tree, which she kept recording changes of in wonder, and her undying faith in God and the importance of morality and keeping hope would put some of us to shame as we tend to pity ourselves in much more trivial ordeals.<br /><br />It is true that at times my mind wandered with this book -- after all, it is a diary where not much can really happen. She is stuck in a secret annexe with seven other people for a number of years, so little can occur. Even so, her ponderings on faith and justice, her outlook on life and self-improvement, and her essays on improving oneself and changing the world one person at a time is encouraging.<br /><br />While some parts lapsed, the book grew more interesting toward the end. I don't think this was because it was coming to a head, but rather because as she aged and matured she began to open more of herself up and to dwell on a variety of important, difficult issues. I felt a tugging of heart at the sweet crush between her and Peter, the budding teenage romance and friendship. I liked the companionship and strength she drew from her older, quieter sister, and her father seemed like an admirable man and role model. Her mother seemed to love her children and her husband and, although told through a rebelling teenagers words, seemed also admirable.<br /><br />It's bittersweet that her death was met only two months before the war ended, and they had made it in hiding so very long, but I like to think her courage still held up through everything. While she never grew up to become the published novelist and visit France to study art, or to be an independent woman who would be \\"more than just another housewife,\\" she did pen a diary that would impact the world more than any piece of fiction ever would. A book that not only has lasted the test of time, but that shall always do so -- filled with hope, young love, promise, and a determination to remain yourself no matter the external circumstances.a rebelling teenagers words, seemed also admirable.<br /><br />It's bittersweet that her death was met only two months before the war ended, and they had made it in hiding so very long, but I like to think her courage still held up through everything.

B00F0AAC26|5.0|I guess when you play with a group of musicians as often as Elvis Costello has The Roots, and you obviously enjoy the creative exchange, you'd have to eventually have that &#34;Damn! We need to do something!&#34; moment.<br />From the first funk-tinged track to the final gospel-infused track that ends with a string arrangement (Ah, strings! Curtis Mayfield, are you still inspiring people so long after you left us? Make that a Yes.) this album brings it.<br />Yes, Black Thought is missing, but this is Elvis Costello & The Roots. It's not a Roots album, per se.<br />Not that The Roots is merely a back-up band for Mr. Costello.<br />Far from it.<br />All of the songs are a journey, and I have my favourites.<br />Strings knit some of the songs together, and the arrangement with horns that ends &#34;Refuse To Be Saved&#34; makes me want to see a concert version of this LP complete with strings and horns. It's glorious.<br />And the next song on the LP is a head-nodding, funky re-visit to Costello's &#34;Wake Me Up&#34;.<br />I have the live version of this song done with Costello and Toussaint and it's awesome...but this one is my favourite.<br />&#34;Grenade&#34; is another favourite. Comparing one's lover to a ticking grenade? Wow. &#34;She's pulling out the pin...&#34;? What, holding her hair? Holding a piece of clothing? She's about to explode...and it might be kinda all right.<br />This is one of those LPs that's put together perfectly: The ebb and flow of each tune, the arrangements, the mix.<br />The Roots is a band that doesn't f*** around. They are a *band* and they handle their business. Who does that any more?<br />(By the way, you need to be following Questlove on Twitter and pick up his book. You know where to look.)<br />These days most LPs are about those couple of &#34;hits&#34; and the rest is...well...*meh*.<br />A well put-together LP is a thing of beauty. This LP is not only put-together, it's *stacked*.<br />As I said, this is an inspired collaboration.on.
B00005N5RM|4.0|Remakes either work or fall flat on their faces; no matter what our thoughts are on these, it's inevitable they'll keep coming. We can stand in line and picket Hollywood, we can sign internet petitions that they become so long they would be a fortune to print out, we can send letters, rave on websites, rant on instant messenger...but to no avail. For remakes, much like cheesy science fiction fare, will always live on.<br /><br />In the 80's this mindset was as strong as ever, particularly since previous science fiction/horror flicks had been redone and with success. Chuck Russell took on the project of readapting the 50's version of the blob, a tale of alien goo coming from outer space and being discovered in a small town, where it promptly begins to devour people. The more nutritious humans it digests, the bigger the blob grows, and the harder it is to kill. This story is identical in its basic theme, with some small changes to adapt to modern audiences. (What else would be the point? Hello Psycho!)<br /><br />Here we have the standard boy and girl, 'hot and heavy' and 'young in love.' They're the 'eager beavers' of the story, trying desperately to convince all adults that the teenagers are telling the truth when they exclaim a giant blob has come to eat them all and take over the world. In the original version the teenage boy and girl were more innocent, clich&eacute;, and goody two shoes (in other words, sickening). Here they are more 'current' except for the 80's way of overdoing things. Unfortunately once this movie was given an update, it also adopted the tacky as hell dialogue and - yes, folks, it's inevitable isn't it? - one liners. These still cliche teens are a bit different in personality, but propelled forward with the same ol' motivations.<br /><br />Fortunately with the remake comes more eye candy. At least another bucket of blood coats this film reel, with the blob being a bigger, badder, and generally cooler beastie than before. We even get the delight of seeing the cytoplastic chomper ingest his victims and literally dissolve them inside its hideous, transparent being. Sometimes the victims are still living, making it that much more horrifying and uber-cool. The telephone booth scene illustrated this the best. Effects in this area are great and dare to cross the MPAA no-no line to give us the juicy stuff.<br /><br />Also, as it known for current horror, the pace has picked up. Not only does the blob roll faster, the scenes do as well. It's a bit like comparing Romero's Dawn of the Dead Zombies to the remakes. Instead of rumbling and gooing along it's in your face faster than you can blink. It even does the quick jump scares that would make one of the holy three slashers jealous. Action has been pumped up in a major way, and even if you find the whole thing rather silly (which is the point, anyway), you'll likely not get bored.<br /><br />Direction is pretty right, emphasizing that the blob can literally be everywhere and strike when it chooses. The scenes at the docs and the food place are particularly thrilling. It's never bad to see a blob break through glass or suck someone through a sink drain is it? The deaths are inventive for a killer of this style, and they laid on enough special effects to have it work. Admittedly the lower budget film did have its flaws with some of the blob effects - as the size grows the realism diminishes. This can be ignored, however, considering the source. After all, we don't go into movies of this style with serious mindsets and analytical outlooks, now do we?<br /><br />Another notable difference between the two blobs is a bit of social commentary. In the orginal the teens weren't believed until the town saw before their very eyes the devious, diabolical diner for themselves. As a result the people flocked together like a pack of wolves to devour their prey and conquered the alien once and for all. Here, though, we get introduced to - du du dum! - another favorite and all toofamiliar science cliche. The evil adult governmental agency conspiracies! What fun! And what would this be without the well known evil doctor figure? It could be said that the take back then was that society flocked together in the face of the enemy and reigned as triumphant by getting high from team effort, while in modern times its an all for yourself and all for one show. I do doubt, though, that times have changed that much - man has always just generally stunk. Perhaps the \\"ooh, there's something cool over there, let's take over it and use it to our advantage\\" train of thought is more realistic and always has been, no matter what the decade.<br /><br />Which will you prefer more? Hard to say. It's not easy to recapture the magic of a 50's flick like this one where it's still able to keep its oozing charm. When the movie was remade, some of the magic was left behind. The blob has certainly wore thin by the decade. It's idea and general premise worked better in a different time and for a different audience.  However, it was nice to revisit a classic tale as well, with some modern fine tuning and nifty special effects. If you wish to ignore the characters horrid dialogue, then this movie should suit you just fine. It holds power over the original in a few spots, but the safest bet is just to keep an eye on them both. You never know when they'll grow out of hand.iar science cliche.

B002QUWYWE|5.0|Rob Reiner isn't a fan of horror or even supernatural films but felt drawn to the King plot and decided to give it a go. His general avoidance of the genre allowed him to not delve into old and worn cliches and give us something new. We have a purely psychological horror movie with drama undertones and an exceptional cast.<br /><br /> What Annie is most obsessed with is Paul's series featuring Misery Chastain. She happens to find his newest manuscript that he had in his car with him. In this version he had killed Misery off and Annie goes berserk! After calming herself a little she then sits and thinks that maybe he just did an evil turn and can now redeem himself. She sets up a writing area for him and forces him to resurrect her beloved character...or suffer the consequences. Definitely not the most ideal climate to work in, Sheldon is confused, afraid, and underneath that is outrage and anger wanting to break free.<br /><br /> Annie Wilkes, played by Kathy Bates, won an academy award for best actress. This role really brought her to the attention of the public. Paul Sheldon, played by James Caan, was convincing. These two are the main characters but we also see a sheriff and his wife for some parts. This was done to break up the isolation theme of the movie and add interesting contrast. One thing I feel when watching Sheldon is how helpless he is. Trapped, wounded, isolated, confused and drugged.<br /><br /> The scene where Paul goes to \\"explore\\" while Annie is coming from the store is so wound full of tension I could barely tolerate it. My heart was pumping, my stomach was tight, my nerves were on full alert. I couldn't even sit still.<br /><br /> Some of the scenes involving Wilkes and Sheldon are startlingly brutal and stay in your head. The nurse is obviously bananas and you catch glimpses between rage, compassion, loneliness, and a morbid type of love/desire.<br /><br /> One thing funny to watch is Annie's dialogue. \\"You silly bird\\" and other quotes are priceless. She also says \\"Oh, pooh,\\" and has her own made believe thesaurus replacing common swear words. She has a big pot bellied pet pig (named Misery of course), and we see such a complex person here that we can't help but clap for the scriptwriter.<br /><br /> We also get to witness some psychological warfare going on and the battle of an intelligent mind versus a loony one.<br /><br /> The climax is a brilliant wrap-up; no cop outs here and it ended exactly the way it should have.<br /><br /> I did happen to have read this novel. More violent and gruesome but not too much was altered for the screen so King fans should walk away pleased.<br /><br /> Overall a great movie that keeps the heart pumping and the mind working, while holding the gore at bay. Reiner may not be the biggest horror fan -- but he makes it well and even though blockbuster has this in their drama section, this little horror splash is not getting away from us!

B00CIXE8UU|3.0|This should be available as a normal 2 CD set so I'm posting my review here pending its appearance.<br /><br />This is a live recording of a concert which marked the bicentenary of the founding of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde in Vienna on 29th November 1812 and the defeat of Napoleon in Moscow, heralding the possibility of Austria's liberation from their forced allegiance to the French. It was thus both a cultural and a political, patriotic statement, with Timotheus representing Austrian musical supremacy and Alexander the Emperor who is in thrall to the musician's art.<br /><br />It sought to recreate the performance of \\"Timotheus\\", the German version of Handel's \\"Alexander's Feast\\", whose score for a German translation had been prepared by Mozart for the Society of Nobleman in 1790 and which served as the basis of the 1812 celebration. It has so much going for it: Nikolaus Harnoncourt a few days before his 83rd birthday, in the mature plenitude of his powers evincing no sign of flagging and directing a very beefed up orchestra in a performance (I quote the excellent notes)\\"for which the Concentus Musicus fielded as many players as could be accommodated on the platform in the Grosser Musikvereinsaal, while the Singverein of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde was made up of hundred or so singers...to recreate the sort of massed sounds produced in 1812 in a large hall.\\"<br /><br />The excitement of the occasion is enhanced by the raucous, atmospheric period horns and a truly impressive bass drum, added to Mozart's orchestration by the first conductor, Franz von Mosel, who, to control these large forces, used a baton for the first time in the history of music. The choir is terrific and the playing both technically and aesthetically of the finest. The recorded sound is big and warm.<br /><br />Add to this admixture the presence of the wonderful Gerald Finley and the whole enterprise looks so promising. Finley in fact has relatively little to do - only two arias and a snippet of recitative - though he does it with such authority and panache. The other two soloists, however, have a much larger contribution, and there's the rub: they are both disappointing. Werner G&uuml;ra brings a slight, strangulated tenor to his music and very little variety of tone. He struggles with the coloratura and is audibly short of breath, at times gasping before the runs. Italian period-specialist soprano Roberta Invernizzi is worse: it astonishes me that a singer can go through training, begin performing then be regularly engaged by prestigious institutions while carrying a vocal handicap that will inevitably preclude a major career. In this case it is an applied, wobbly vibrato that she has a habit of suddenly unleashing like a Taser after long, swelled notes without any pulse at all. She also has a tic of squeezing and primping phrases in a manner that is clearly meant to be winsomely expressive but increasingly becomes merely irritating; it seems she can sing absolutely nothing straight and rely on Handel's music to do the job. Surely better could have been found for such a major musical event? As such, what could have been a landmark recording and a real testament to \\"The Power of Music\\" becomes a might-have-been.<br /><br />The much smaller scale English original is by no means the same entity but for the best of what is some of Handel's most winning music, I return to the old, 1978 Philip Ledger recording on EMI. Despite it also having a tenor less than ingratiating, it features Thomas Allen, who is no second-best if I cannot have Finley, and the sopranos Helen Donath and Sally Burgess are simply lovely.a snippet of recitative - though he does it with such authority and panache.

0553212001|4.0|I finally got to read a tale so well-known around the world. It wasn't a disappointment, although the Hyde in this 18th century piece of literature is less violent than later adaptions, likely due to the age of the times.<br /><br />The rigid Victorian background setting, as well as the Dr. being at the height of social esteem for his profession, drives home the point that a person would love to let go and unwind against the oppressing constraints. Always having to be polite, proper, careful, and courtly had to have grown old for some. I know it did the author himself, who took to hanging out in unruly areas for some release before leaving for more isolated surroundings where he could relax and let his hair down (so to speak).<br /><br />Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is an excellent literary study on the bizarre, complex dual natures inside humanity. Whether one thinks this duality is a plague of humanity, or else a relief, is up to debate and interpretation.<br /><br />A shorter piece, it needs no further length to serve its purpose. It's told through the viewpoint of a friend, so that it's as if the reader is outside looking in, seeing a mystery unwind, making the theme more potent. Being inside the mind of the man would not have worked as well in some ways, but would have worked better in others. The mystery would have been lost on what was going on, but on the positive side more emotion would have been felt as he struggled with his internal demons if we could have been an actual part of his thoughts.<br /><br />Stevenson having it from an outside perspective made it more of a mysterious study and observation rather than an experience. Still it was easy to relate to as we all understand. The good Doctor Lanyard could not understand, clearly, as he was so horrified it was indicated it led to his death or else played a massive part. This could be because so many people in the Victorian times were always in the mindset of being right and proper that it would not have even been considered to some to let this side of themselves out, or that this side even existed to be released.<br /><br />Everyone today knows what the story is about, so reading it for the time time doesn't hold impact or surprise. Written in the day though, it was ambiguous with small clues told through a narrow narrative, and would have been a shock to the audiences, much as Psycho must have initially been.<br /><br />Movies and such show Hyde as deformed or evil looking. Here it shows him as older and a normal looking face that, once looked upon, people immediately know there is something wrong and \\"off\\" about it. They can't always put their fingers on the reason, yet they react with dismay, sensing something there that shouldn't be, wanting to get away from it.  Hyde covers his face much of the time for these clear reasons as much as he can. In addition, Hyde is always shown as older and much, much shorter than Jekyll. This makes it a much larger surprise to the audience on them being the same in the end.<br /><br />Some theories have supposed that besides the Victorian strangling of the day, that Stevenson also incorporated the theme of Opium, alcoholism and other drug dependency as a society ailment, and the moral lessons and themes of how much a person can be aged and transfigured, irrevocably altered so much to the point where they may one day stand unrecognizable to their closest friends and families, turning themselves into their own versions of monsters.<br /><br />Although 18th century literature, since it's easy to read and not bogged down by over-flowery writing and drawn-out wording, it should appeal to audiences today. The theme is something that will always appeal, no matter which generation is reading it. In fact, further generations will likely appreciate it more as they are more familiar with the recognized dual nature of man.been considered to some to let this side of themselves out, or that this side even existed to be released.<br /><br />Everyone today knows what the story is about, so reading it for the time time doesn't hold impact or surprise.

This makes it a much larger surprise to the audience on them being the same in the end.<br /><br />Some theories have supposed that besides the Victorian strangling of the day, that Stevenson also incorporated the theme of Opium, alcoholism and other drug dependency as a society ailment, and the moral lessons and themes of how much a person can be aged and transfigured, irrevocably altered so much to the point where they may one day stand unrecognizable to their closest friends and families, turning themselves into their own versions of monsters.<br /><br />Although 18th century literature, since it's easy to read and not bogged down by over-flowery writing and drawn-out wording, it should appeal to audiences today. The theme is something that will always appeal, no matter which generation is reading it. In fact, further generations will likely appreciate it more as they are more familiar with the recognized dual nature of man.

0064404994|5.0|The Chronicles of Narnia is a legendary series, spawned by an atheist turned Christian who became equally famous for his Christian theology book, Mere Christianity. He wrote this creative fairy tale for his goddaughter, Lucy, probably not aware at the time it would become a fairy tale for so many for so long.<br /><br />One of the things he said in the note has become of his most famous and quoted quotes:<br /><br />\\"But one day you will be old enough to start reading fairy tales again.\\"<br /><br />I  grew up on The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe through the 1979 TV animated version. This was in the older days when you had mom and pop type rental places around the block, in which my family frequented at least three times a month. I rented this one often, charmed by its magical presence and unique story line. Seeing it so many times, and since the animated version stuck SO close to the book (the same dialogue even), every time a character in the book spoke I kept picturing it with the inflections used in the movie. Fun times.<br /><br />Being such a huge reader then, I'm not sure why I never thought to seek out the book and read the written version. As an adult I've sought the series out and have been wanting to read it eagerly. This review will show I'm not disappointed...I didn't think I'd be, but there was a small fear there that I'd be wrong.<br /><br />This book is a prime example of how adults can enjoy this fairy tale aimed toward children and young adults. It's ideal for any age. Filled with adventure, a twist of the imagination, clear heroes and clear villains, castles and kingdoms, speaking animals, right and wrong, battles, friendships, and the bonding of family. This highly fantastical world was creatively written and invented, and CS Lewis managed to capture all sorts of magic with this one. The pacing was even throughout and never grew boring.  Dialogue is kept to the point of the story and it's clear to picture the world without the tale being dragged down by repetitiveness.<br /><br />Both the villain and the hero had a flair with words and a powerful presence (Yes, religious overtones with Aslan are as always clear). I never picked up on them as a kid and didn't even realize the Christian undertones until someone told me as a teen. I think I would have been able to pick up on it now but who knows?  One of the things that made this book work so well were the intriguing people CS Lewis birthed. Lucy was a charming, quaint thing who started the adventure and kept it going through anyone elses doubts. Edmund was a vindictive little child who ended up redeeming himself painfully. The older siblings are also well-written but they do stand in the background to the vibrancy of the two younger characters.<br /><br />It's certainly not just the children that readers remember and love, though. Mr. Tumnus will forever be the awesome faun who makes cakes, tea, and sacrifices his role for friendship. The Beaver family provide surprisingly abrupt humor in the most serious situations, and Aslan himself comes across as powerful and awe-inspiring as CS Lewis tried to make him out to be. The witch as a villain is kept simple and without much story or depth, but for a fairy tale this works wonders.<br /><br />I'm not sure if I would have liked the story as much if I didn't grow up with the movie. The two magics may have merged in my mind to make it that much more mesmerizing. I'd like to think, though, that it's impact would still have been as strong.<br /><br />The only annoyance is the end where it was explained the children, now grown, speak differently since they've now been Kings and Queens so long. How glad I am they didn't speak this way through the rest of the book. It was so awkward I don't think I would have been able to read it if they had!<br /><br />When closing the chapter, or turning off the TV, the very end is always a little bittersweet. To have found the most powerful of magic and to have lost it...well, thatbites. I suppose it was not supposed to be as sad as all that, though, for with the professors words and maybe even CS Lewis's point, the magic of Narnia - once discovered, experienced, and embraced - continues to live in the hearts and minds of the characters and readers once the world has been left.bites.

B00000ILDF|3.0|Ah, here it is. The much despised and somewhat controversial installment in the Alien series. But is this one as bad as many fans seem to think, or is there redeeming traits after all?<br /><br />Before anything else, it can be said that Alien 3 is one dark, bleak film - even more depressing than the first 2 and that's saying a lot. The Alien series has always been realistic and shied away from happy-go-lucky endings. We fall in love with the characters only to see them killed. The series is still following that method; this one isn't any different. The direction was taken even farther with the lighting, the general cast (no humor here), and other maneuvers.<br /><br /> Alien 3 does work on a different level. They dropped the subplot of motherhood (which I read in an interview pissed Cameron the hell off), placed less emphasis on technology, but just as much on scientific exploitation and the evils of the \\"company.\\" The third installment is plausible, and would have been the perfect ending of the series - making it the best trilogy of all time. It's not now because we have Alien 4 thrown in but that's another review. (If you want dirt on a movie, read the review for that one - there's plenty of trash to pick up where it's concerned)<br /><br />At the end of Aliens we had 4 survivors. Lt. Ripley, the little girl Newt, Corporal Hicks, and the damaged but workable droid Bishop. But Ripley is the only one who will be in this movie. The crash damaged Bishop even more than just being ripped apart by a giant, hormone-rich, female queen. Handsome Hicks was impaled during the crash, and Newt had a crack in her cryotube, causing her to drown. So the movie begins showing this, letting us know that, once again, Ripley is all alone.<br /><br /> Ripley lands on Fury 161, a desolate planet that used to be a maximum security type prison housing rapists, theives, murderers -- hardened criminals. The men have found an order of religion which they have strictly upheld. They have never had the temptation of a woman though, and their limits seem to be strained and tested when Ripley appears on board. Due to the worst lice infestation ever known, she is forced to shave her head. With one eye being bloodshot from broken veins, she is not the most attractive species! ...Neither are the inmates for that matter. If I had a choice of who to ask to the prom in terms of the looks, the alien is looking better and better all the time. Of course an alien makes its way on the planet via Ripley's damaged ship, this time not in the mood for more human hunting, and instead impregnates a dog. The ensuing scene with the poor animal is quite violent and depressing, resulting in an alien unlike others we've seen. We learn that the alien apparently adopts unique traits of its hosts, and this one enjoys using all four legs, running on the ceiling, grabbing people from above, and is more...errr, canine-like in appearance.<br /><br /> To further upset the balances of their survival, there are no weapons of any kind on the planet. Weaver is extremely anti-gun anyway, and encouraged this aspect of the plot. No matter, as it does make an interesting situation, although seeing the aliens blasted away by firearms is pretty darn fun too. There is also no way to escape the planet - a supply cargo comes every six months, but once the network learns of Ripley they dispatch a ship immediately, although it should be clear to the viewer this is not necessarily a good thing.<br /><br />Alien 3 is quite different from the second, devoid of humor, general action, the groovy machines and big weapons. I believe this is one main reason this film was so generally despised; people were itching for the same hyper mania and fun, instead getting a very serious, slower paced flick that relied only on intelligence and no brawn. The characters didn't help matters much either, as most were so serious and deadpan it was hard to tell them apart and even harder to care about some of them. Their personalities didn't stick out as much as the characters in previous installments. The only exception was killed off way too soon, which was a big mistake.<br /><br /> Despite the rather slow pace, the univolved characters, and some dismissal slayings, Alien 3 is a film that embraced the franchise and came across as believable. It's grim, it's dirty, it's depressing, but it fits. The focus is Ripley, and it shows what's she's become, how her life has been destroyed by these creatures, they her worst nightmare has finally come true, and that there's only one thing left to do to end it once and for all. She knows she'll never escape the clutches of the reptilian race, and instead embraces the fact she must make the ultimate sacrifice in order to defeat the money hungry, power grubbing company once and for all, as well as delivering the final, infinite, middle finger raising f- you to the race that destroyed her life and dreams.<br /><br /> Because of the money involved, Fox stuck its ugly head in the picture too much, interfering with director David Finch's vision. This created harsh tension on set, which is sadly not touched upon enough in the Quadrilogy released. The incesstant editing and cut room treatment resulted in too quick deaths and inconsistency. I dug some of Finch's shot and have to wonder how much better the film would have been if they had just left him the hell alone and let him do his thing unbothered.<br /><br />Alien 3 spoke loads in terms of greed and hopelessness against a big bad world. Even if it does lack some of the social commentary from before, it carried on other points nicely. Weaver is as strong as ever, doing what must be done, and the very last scene, where you hear her original ending transmission from the Nostromo in part one, injects that perfect, eerie touch.onalities didn't stick out as much as the characters in previous installments.

B00ADR2DTG|4.0|I had a bad first impression when my Bravo V2 arrived. The first fault I noticed was the crooked volume knob. The second and most egregious one was the bad left channel. There was no sound coming out of the L. channel. Tried my laptop, my Ipod, different cables, two sets of headphones, no luck. I ended up getting an RMA and receiving another Bravo V2 within a week.<br /><br />The second one was a charm. It matched well my Bose OE2 and my Sennheiser HD 600. No complaint.<br /><br />The smaller Bose OE2 which is slightly tuned for decent bass and mids sounded fluid and warm.<br />The Sennheiser HD600 takes the cake and ultimately shines with its fuller sound on the V2.<br /><br />I had to dock one star because of the first shipment being crap. Hopefully this thing lasts.
0156030306|5.0|I remember my mother watching this sometimes on TV when I was growing up. The haunting memory of an adult man in a swing-set at the end with the expression of a joyful child is hard to forget. I'd always wanted to thread the book, fascinated at the story. As soon as I started reading it, I knew dissappointment would not be met. The book far exceeds the movie!<br /><br />This truly incredible story is advanced for its time in terms of science-fiction and what man can (and cannot) accomplish. It's not a black and white issue either; today, we still wouldn't know which would be the best course to take. Is it so much of an improvement to have brought his IQ to such a high level, would it have been better to let him stay the way nature and God intended? He was held back by the disabilties of his mind...he couldn't be promoted at work and only worked as a favour of a friend. His friends at work made fun of him and he didn't even realize it. He couldn't have personal, adult relationships with women or other men. He couldn't make sound decisions about savings, checking, safety, insurance, and the proper way to live. The tragedy of this is he realized his limitations and dreamed of being smart like \\"other people\\", able to live as a normal man would.<br /><br />The book focuses on every heartbreaking aspect - developing initial attractions to women as his mind started maturing, the realization and horror at his parents dismissal of him and shame as they were unable to handle how limited their son was, seeing he didn't have the good friends he always thought he did. When his IQ reached higher proportions, he was able to then see that despite his increased mind-power, he was still as isolated as ever from his peers. Likely due to character trats inherited from his past, whether he was \\"cuired\\" nor not, but mainly because no whe has crossed over to the other side, the opposite side, where he's not too intelligent to relate with anyone.<br /><br />His supreme intelligence made it so that he was the only who realized where the experiment would go wrong, and that like a cancer, his new-found mind would slowly fade away. Having to tell doctors the inevitable must have been especially daunting. Imagine, instead of getting the news from someone else, you realize what they can't, and have to focus on convincing them of your own personal doom.<br /><br />This is not a happy book, obviously. However, it's incredibly powerful. It reads nearly as a diary would - he was supposed to records thoughts as part of the experiments and process. The first part of the book you see horrible grammar, bad spelling, as if a small child were writing the book. It evolves, as the man does, becoming poetic, beautiful, gifted, and bitter.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this book highly enough. It's full of lessons about life, people, intelligence, social standing, science, dire consequences, faith, motivations, and acceptance. It shows that the ponderings and philosophies of people in regard to their fellow man have almost always stayed the same, no matter the generation.<br /><br />From beginning to end it was both tragic and sobering. The book shows how literature can be a work of art.  The ending closes the book, but the memory of the book shall not fade.so that he was the only who realized where the experiment would go wrong, and that like a cancer, his new-found mind would slowly fade away.

B00A285OOW|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was exactly what I love about Phillipa Gregory books. I was sad when it was over. Elizabeth of York was a great protagonist and this was a fun fast read.
B000HF6ZR0|5.0|You can already guess at the start, when I say I can't figure out why this one received so many negative reviews, that I enjoyed this graphically enhanced brainy splash fest and feel it has hasn't been earning the praise it deserves.<br /><br /> The super mind that delivered the blockbuster Jurassic Park and the slightly less popular Congo (have you ever read this guys background? I'm not kidding about Chrichton having a heck of an IQ!) brings us Sphere, another underwater-scientific-adventure-alien-encounter. Except this one offers something a little different. No, really. I'm serious here! Stop smirking.<br /><br /> Dustin Hoffman, clinical psychological, is brought in originally under the pretense that he will be there in case of any freak outs from the rest of the crew. In reality it's based on an idiot college paper he tossed together to get a good grade years ago, but I guess it's another case of our past coming back to haunt us. Sharon Stone plays an independent and clever woman (who has a past with Hoffman), and is under the microscope for being slightly unstable. Enter other big heads and over-achievers (Samuel L. Jackson as Dr. Harry Adams, Liev Schreiber as Dr. Ted Fielding, Queen Latifah as Alice, Peter Coyote as Barnes) and we have ourselves a good little group of academics.<br /><br /> Maybe some turned their heads a bit because of the dialogue. There's plenty of it, it helps hold the movie together and might as well be considered the main plot device. It's also pretty \\"smart-shop\\" talk. But this didn't deter me at all. They weren't stuffy sounding snobs who sputtered out words I couldn't comprehend half the time. While I don't know shit about what fields most of them are in (and admittably spent a lot of the time reclining half-slumped in my chair thinking to myself, Golly gee whiz are these people smart!) they didn't drone on and on about things that didn't have some big impact on the movie. There was also humor involved, and it all worked together - the cast had a great chemistry, they're all established actors who can pull the roles off to a T, and I genuinely cared about most of them. There, that's done. Characterization gets a big check mark in its' box.<br /><br /> When I mentioned special effects in the first sentence, I didn't mean this was another excuse just to show off the advancement of computer graphics. But the effects, when used, were excellent. We get a giant squid and this is one convincing critter. There's also a weird globe ball that has a great significance in the film. All well done.<br /><br /> The tone is serious but also humorous and realistic. This is most likely how these people would behave and all of it gives the film that much more credibility. Yes, there actually are some creepy moments. Not much of that cheap-jump-shot effect we see in the Friday films (although there are one or two). Mainly just genuine fear felt by the people and good direction transferred that to me.<br /><br /> There's no big guns and this isn't an action flick. But there are plenty of deaths, many of them disturbing (What other film can you see someone bite the big one through killer Jellyfish?) In the end this film is what it is: Intelligent, gritty, suspenseful, unique, and just plain interesting.<br /><br /> Most of the beginning is set up establishing the characters but the tone is set already when they keep finding freaky things that just shouldn't be, and running into people they haven't seen for years and didn't know would be on the mission. It stayed about the same pace, picking up paranoia about the mid-ending act. Very well done methods of distrust there. The ending was a bit of a letdown though. It was a logical wrap up but ... well, without spoiling details let me just say I didn't care as much for the way \\"it\\" was dealt with.<br /><br /> While you're now likely picturing \\"it\\" as some freaky creature being blown into a billion pieces while squealing guitars are strumming in the background, I'll getoff this ship and leave you to make up your own minds. Take the plunge based on my thoughts, or else listen to some of the other reviews and don't test the waters at all.off this ship and leave you to make up your own minds.

B000FA57US|2.0|Michael, injured after part four's fiasco, takes a year to heal and guess what? He's ready on Halloween night. (Perhaps he has an inner ticking clock?) Showing a lack of hospitality by slaying his nurse, he ventures back to the same town as before: Haddonfield<br /><br /> There young Jamie is recovering in a hospital. No, they didn't continue with the cool plot possibility that the ending of four hinted at. She is back to her sweet self but instead of being able to talk, she simply grunts and squeaks a lot. It's annoying.<br /><br /> Loomis is there the whole time, but growing more unpleasant. He is determined that Myers is still alive and keeps trying to get Jamie's help through manipulation. She seems to have some sort of wierd psychic thing going down with her uncle -- which is cool in a small way but doesn't make a lick of sense either.<br /><br /> The melodrama present in four is also here but enhanced, which I of course hate. The nurse who takes care of little irritating Jamie overdoses on drama and as a consequence I wanted to hunt her down and kill the woman myself.<br /><br /> Jamie's aunt Rachel from the previous film is here and as always does a good job. But her friends leave much to be desired and one can't help but salivate for their moment in Myer's hands. Central point being Tina, a dark haired giggling valley girl type, who overdoes everything. The rest are completely stereotypical, not realistic, and this dissapoints as it wasn't this way with the other Halloween films.<br /><br /> Inconsistencies are among the biggest slaps in the fae. The Myers house is now a looming mansion. Michael himself looks and acts differently, a little bit like Jason. And now we have cheesy humor being injected through 2 cops.<br /><br /> Any deaths aren't suspenseful -- they either happen too quickly or not enough is shown. Some are stereotypical as well - like Jason, Myers kills a couple that are just getting down and dirty on the barn floor. Five was cut by the censors more than four, all gore is very minimal, and if a slasher can't even offer decent deaths, what can it offer?<br /><br /> Overall s***ty news for Halloween fans as the series dramatically cheapens and we're dragged along kicking and screaming.if a slasher can't even offer decent deaths, what can it offer?

0380730405|4.0|\\"Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again\\"....A strong opening line that many have heard, even without reading the book.<br /><br />Rebecca is one of those \\"classic\\" novels that no one I know in person has heard of, yet is apparently famous. After reading it, I see there's a good reason it should be so. Sometimes the aged style wilts the book slightly, although it's marvelously gothic. Wicked suspense permeates the second half, with ample emotional wrenching being present in the beginning. The first chapter is the toughest as it primarily deals with just description for many pages, but after this it goes smoother.<br /><br />Overall the writing is stunning. DeMaurier has a special knack of poetically weaving together dreamy-like sequences. It's easy to relate to the cloud-climbing protagonist simply because your own head finds its easier to seek this mindset after enough flowing of the author's words. It's a unique style that stands out and takes the breath away some. When action is fierce I at times wish some of the rambling fantasizing would cease, but for the most part it's absent when it should be. I'm curious on reading more with this author, she really was quite talented.<br /><br />As for the plot, it's purely gothic. The protagonist is not a typical headstrong individual, but rather a more submissive, inexperienced young woman, unsure of her confidences. Rather than having a stunning beauty, she is plain and unadorned, not caring for hair fashions and clothing. It's alluded to the fact of how plain she is, and how she minds this, but it is not a stumbling block for long. The ending of the novel is a cliffhanger of sorts, even if we can surmise what has happened from the opening chapters. It is a hectic, frantic rush of an ending in the last paragraphs, leaving off with an ominous and unsettled feeling, which pretty much sums up this entire book.<br /><br />I dug Maxim, at times he was aloof and cold but I found him intriguing. The infamous Mrs. Danvers was mad and dominating without the author having to put too much obviousness into play. Really, the maids presence does not take up too much page time, but still manages to be present somehow in the mind of the protagonist and readers, nice. Supporting characters are sympathetic and enjoyable props to the heroine's trials.<br /><br />Anxious to read the sequel and hope it's just as good. This is a classic that you shouldn't pass up, especially if you are into the gothic trend.was mad and dominating without the author having to put too much obviousness into play.

The characters are more defined and you get a better since why the Outlook begins the slow walk of decay becoming a character of the book itself towards the end. If you enjoyed the small screen productions you can't go wrong with the book and will be rewarded for you efforts in this short 429 page book.

B00AZMFJYA|4.0|When I watched this movie and discovered the villain was Khan, I was afraid this was just a remake of The Wrath of Khan (which was real good but usually remakes aren't). was very pleased that the plot of this movie was like a prequel to 'Wrath'.  Of course, in wrath there was no mention made of running into Khan earlier - but no every nuance can be thought of in advance.  I really like the cast of both of the 'new' Star Trek movies. This movie has a darker, more dramatic story than the first movie (which I prefer because it was lighter and the bringing together of the cast - which was a treasure for Original series Trekkies - was more entertaining than the story-drama of the movie). Both movies are very good. Having been a Star Trek original series fan (I was in the 7th grade when the series debuted ) I didn't think it would have been possible that a 'new' replacement crew could be gathered that so remarkable resembled the original actors and in style, bearing and character. My favorite was and still is the Dr. McCoy character in the cast.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Beautiful setting great cast. Loved it highly recommended<br />Watched an episode a night on ipad. Can't wait for next season
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is one of the most awesome games in the app store!!<br />and it is FREEEEEEEEEEEE<br />I really like this app it is so awesome and you just get the app and teach your self how to play My Horse<br /> that is how easy it is
B000LPS4BQ|3.0|For those of us that grew up with Scooby-doo cartoons, this adaptation is nice. Easy to watch and a good movie for the kids, my nieces love it
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This was a great read! Everyone at some point in their life can relate to the feelings of brokenness in this book! I loved the characters and learning the language of flowers! So happy it ended they way I was wanting it to!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The characters and the acting and the writing are all first class.  The drama is intense and all of the little stories and plots within the show itself are fascinating as they unfold.
B005LAIGSM|5.0|My favorite movie at the moment! Great story, great cast. I like the fact that a digital copy is attached to the dvd.
B003ASLJO0|3.0|Some of my wife's friends and family enjoyed this film and recommended it highly.  Obviously, it was popular and I do like Clint Eastwood.  I had no idea what the film was about until I watched it.  My initial reaction was Clint Eastwood was almost too grumpy to be believable.  Even his 'hellos' were nasty.  I thought the theme of bad guys ruining the peaceful lives of good people was a bit tired but did come from a little different approach.  I did appreciate the unusual and clever ending; although, I continue to struggle with it.  That is, do I like it or not?
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|liked the book good story even though you can guess &#34;who done it&#34; it had some unexpected twists good for book clubs
B00AB2NYNC|5.0|One of the better album packages I have ever purchased. Great sound from a talented group. The Red Rocks video is a bonus of the band at its finest!
B00E5INZ82|4.0|My son loves this game, he plays it continuously on weekends as he is not allowed games during the week. He also likes the shifting of the gears but was under the impression tht you could actually drag the gears as opposed to tapping it.
B0000046KM|4.0|I like her style very much, Soft jazz like this is a favorite genre of mine. Shirley Horne is acs good as it as anyone. The title track is wonderful, a verby uplifting lyric.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Love magic shows so of course this movie would appeal to me.  And that the ending was a fun twist.
B008XG1X18|5.0|put bias aside, this app will change your life. doesn't matter who you are or what you're into, it's on pinterest and it's waaaaaaaaaaiting for yooooooouuu...
B001K3EXTA|5.0|Who does not love the young and Very handsome Robert Redford. And it is an excellent remainder that wealth, fame or money has nothing to do with morals.
1250012570|5.0|there's such a sweet story line and it feels very genuine. the things eleanor worries about and deals with are real teenager things. and there's great music featured in it so that's a plus (: ill just come out and say it. it's better than john green. buy the fricking book.
B0051E9INK|5.0|Most enjoyable story about one mans life and his journey thru time.  How he survives in an existence where he also fights for his survival to the end.
0525478183|4.0|not my favorite john green novel, but it was very good. radar is probably my favorite character ever. didn't really dig margo's character- but that was probably the point idk
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Could use some better directions throughout play, but overall, a lot of fun!!! Explain better about morphs and other types within different scenes, it would save time &amp; confusion.<br /><br />I like the different puzzles within each scene. It makes you work harder for the win!
0142414999|3.0|I love John Green, really I do, but it was just alright. The story was more than a little predictable and it almost feels like a draft, you know??
B005LAIIN0|5.0|I'm not going into detail; everyone else has. I just like zombie movies, and I liked this one. Great Saturday night film.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Amazing, creative, and captivating. I could not put this book down! As well crafted as one of Wool's silos. Don't pass up the chance to experience this impressive and intimidating new world. I am now officially a Hugh Howey devotee.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|Effective! Concise! I'm hooked! I love everything about this book! Explained why I would get everything I wanted and then didn't!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is an awesome game. There are no real missions, points, or levels. That's what makes minecraft so unique, and fun. You get survival and creative on this app. Survival has monsters in it, and you make your own goals, building terrains, caves, buildings, towers, and worlds. Creative allows you to fly through air and have unlimited bricks. It's the best block world game. If you get this app, I would suggest getting the app called Pocket Editor Pro to go along, it allows you to do cool stuff in the game.
B005HED11Y|5.0|I like the the way the shows are set up. and the ease on wathching it on my Roku. Having it on prime is great.
B00AESN8XY|1.0|I bough t the game and got pissed. So I uninstall the peace of from my  kindle I bought by the cheats for seven bucks and I reinstalled it and it stole my money I work hard fir it and all it did was say you you uninstalled so I take your<br />money I hate this game I want a complete refund
0142421715|3.0|I was reluctant to continue the `Matched' series, because I lost the drive to continue it even though I liked the first book a lot. I remember loving the poetic writing style and how beautifully the plot was written out in each chapter. But I learned not to expect the second book will be as good as the first one.<br /><br />And true to my expectations, Crossed by Ally Condie was disappointing. It did have the same poetic writing style and beautiful breezy formatting and plot division. But it was too poetic that I just started getting bored really fast.<br /><br />There was too much inner monologuing and way too much references to actual poems. And eventually, the book felt like it didn't have much substance.<br /><br />The plot continues where the first book left out and follows the characters Cassia and Ky, each getting their own chapters right after each other. I usually loved how some authors like to divide the chapters like that and the way we get to know what's on the mind of both the female and male protagonist. But in this book, I just hated it. And the only thing the  book made me feel was impatience because I wanted the book to end!<br /><br />Crossed by Ally Condie is well-written but lacks the plot and factor to keep a reader interested. A good read for the fans of the `Hunger Games' and `Divergent'
0930289234|5.0|Because while the movie was mediocre, the book is stellar. It is well worth your time and money to pick up.
B00CL1SR7O|4.0|Purchased this for my daughter after attending the Big Time Rush Summer Concert Series...would have been great to bring to the concert for signatures, but she still loves it!
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|Great product! Easy to use, very small and light. You can even use it when you play sports, but it will count your activities as walking.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Loved this book! It really took me by surprise. Can't wait until it comes out as a movie!<br />Read it!
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|It is a good quality movie, a little bit scary for my wife but we watched it twice. We like this movie.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|This game is worth every penny spent on it. Definitely a must have for any gamer's collection no matter their age!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|It's so far the best 3D movie I ever owned. My wife and I watched this movie probably 10 times already.We love it !
B004DM1ZQY|4.0|I liked this option for playing backgammon very much, as one can play singly or with partners. It has great graphics and sound affects and has different levels of play for the novice or expert. It helped to keep myself and a friend entertained for hours while flying to Ireland. I highly recommend this game.
B006YTTVHO|4.0|Ok I admit it: I skipped a lot through the book. Nevertheless IMO it is a good read if you think the title sounds interesting. There is nothing new under the sun but youll be remembered of a lot of common sence in a nice compact form.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|Neat and cool helps you find new cut ways to text .cool awesome fun funny neat helpful creative non-boring time using game
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|What an unexpected surprise!  This is more than magical with unexpected twists.  It keeps you guessing.  You will enjoy this movie.  It is not the same ol' same ol'.  You do not have to like magic acts to enjoy this movie.  There is much more to it than magic.  It's too bad they couldn't come up with a more appealing DVD cover, so please don't go by the cover!
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|This app says what u think it will do nut it is a dead lie so I want I guys to see this dead lie alarm clock and see if it is true that it is a lie so believe me thanks viewers
B001AQO3QA|5.0|20 hours of extras.  Nice blu ray; even though these films were not made during the blu ray era.  Highly recommend for a gift.
B00CDSVZHY|1.0|Tarantino makes cartoons with human actors. Nothing more, nothing less. Beyond overrated.<br /> A great cast does not a great movie make.
B00ET0PZDO|5.0|I live these type of games. I love how I have to think about it. But this one wasn't that hard but it was still really fun. It reminds me of the other games called &quot;Can you escape&quot; and &quot;Escape challenge&quot;. I wish there were more games like this. Or more levels.
B007SXB498|4.0|It's clearly not my all time favorite Pride and Prejudice but still one of the best Jane Austen's. I can't seem to read a JA, the effort to understand the period writing is more concentration than I want to commit, so I listen to them, and they are all wonderful so far. I recommend reading the book summary from Sparknotes, makes it easier to follow and remember all of the characters.
B004XMMSZG|5.0|I am constantly listening to music in my car. I wore our my first ipod touch by using the 1/8th inch jack. Now with my new iPod I just turn on bluetooth and it just works.
B0047SKR54|5.0|And Now I can Watch It on AMAZON INSTANT VIDEO for a very reasonable fee. This is really AWESOME! Get some PRIME today why don't you.
B006PIXKVW|4.0|it is a great movie for kids. It teaches them bravery and patience. I watched with family. We liked it.
B008Y6YCB0|3.0|The video was enjoyable, but not up to the level of the PBS version broadcast a few years ago.  That version seemed to move faster, and the scenes were not as visually cluttered
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|it is so addicting and i cant stop playing! love it so much, i play it even during class!  it is awesome
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|More of the same beloved drama, but maybe gets a little carried away. All the same, you'll be sucked right in!
B001CDWFPC|5.0|I found this Kindle version very  easy to navigate.  It has good cross references and notes, as well.  Very handy when you don't want to haul the real deal somewhere.
B003Y5H4Y8|3.0|Such great acting, but the story had numerous faults.  There are two many illogical actions, and is long-too long.  The flashbacks were good, but too many.<br />Worst part was the whiny message and preaching
0439023513|3.0|I only purchased this book becaue we have to recieve a certain amount of points for reading and each book has a certain amount of points; I would usually read on my iPad as well but I was getting ready to take AIMS and we needed a physical copy.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|A psychological thriller that will keep you hooked all the way through and an ending you wouldn't see coming.  Recommended to all who like hopping across into the dark and delving in the twisted.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|Took a little while to get exciting but I really liked the book and I can't wait to buy the next one!
B009LDD54K|5.0|The gangster stories of USA 20's I can't resist!! True stories or fakes - I love them all!! but won't go past 3rd in this series.
141659521X|5.0|Unfortunately, Mr. Flynn passed away earlier this year from cancer. I personally sent my condolences as I am sure they will miss him even more than any fan ever could. I was so happy to hear previously that his cancer seemed to have gone into remission, but unfortunately it didn't stay that way. Anyway, of course the book is awesome! what else would you expect?
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|I love historical stories and 'wacky' 'what if' stories - which this DVD falls into the latter. I'm sure I'll enjoy this story!!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Delivery time was very delayed product because there was no stock<br /><br />the product works perfectly<br /><br />Very easy installation, up and running in 5 minutes. Not much content, Netflix's and you tube. Maybe Apple TV on the cheap. Waited a looooong time for product.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was great! I coyldnt put it down! Answered so many questions and had me on the edge of my seat the whole book
B000N3ST3Y|4.0|Missing a couple of good songs but a Great deal nonetheless<br />Just what you expect it will be from this band
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|A spell binding story of love, mystery and the reality behind the shadow we call the world.  Read it 10 times and it will probably still yield new insights.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|I watched this with my son last night, he enjoyed it overall but it lost his attention a couple of times. I thought it was ok, worth a watch definitely.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome. It glitches every once in awhile but it doesnt't bother your run at all. Over all its a really good game.
B005LAII80|5.0|This was a most excellent interpretation of the Judge Dredd comics to the big screen!  The world in Dredd needs to be explored more in a movie sequel or two.  Please don't let this movie end with just one movie, not when the vision was properly put on the big screen.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|A great zombie end of time original hope to see next seasons walking dead! A true original now that shane is dead
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|this game is awesome game but no telepods :( please fix this in update ( I beat the game in an hour.)
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Defending Jacob by William Landay is a thriller that keeps the reader guessing until the end about the defendant's guilt or innocence. It raises questions about the fairness of our legal system. All depends on the skills of the prosecutor and of the defense attorney. It was a good read!
B002JXK5VU|5.0|I am a man who loves his science, and this show definitely tickles that section of me.I simply love this show.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was amazing. Seriously. The characters were so lovable, I ugly cried throughout the whole book. Now that I think about it,ugly crying may not be so desirable but it was so heartwarming/breaking at the same time. Buy it!!
B00EBRWN80|1.0|Very limited in channels, streaming very inconsistent, tried viewing a few stations, became irritated with results and uninstalled app.  I was connected to wifi at 12mB/sec.
B00CHI5F5S|4.0|The movie was entertaining, even if somewhat disjointed.  It was great fun to see all the old cars and the period clothing.  They did a great job with that.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series is a feast for the eyes and for the soul.  It is exttemely believable, draws you in and is a feast for the eyes and the soul. I'd recommend to to everyone.
0823015017|5.0|This is a fabulous book for artists of all media. From the day I received it, it started me thinking of color in a totally different way. I am doing all the exercises in the book. While I am enjoying the experience, it is also a lot of work, but worth every bit of effort. I would recommend this book to artists, no matter what their medium is.
1439102813|5.0|5 Stars<br /><br />This book was described as \\"at once beautiful and terrifying\\" by the author/publisher in the book summary.  There simply isn't a better description.  Alice is a professor of cognitive psychology at Harvard and is an expert in linguistics.  Suddenly she starts experiencing difficulties in retrieving words, moments of confusion, and forgetfulness that become too hard to deny or ignore.  She secretly visits her doctor and then a neurologist with the fear that she has a brain tumor - only she is diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's Disease.  We then travel along with Alice on her ever so terrifying journey into Alzheimer's Disease.  She has the monumental task of not only informing, but also convincing, her husband and grown children that she has the disease.  Alice is initially hit hard in the area of language - the very area of her expertise.  We watch her struggle through trying to complete the year at Harvard while she spirals downward.  In the midst of all of this, she tries to maintain her sense of self and remain Alice.<br /><br />I absolutely loved this book.  My background is in Clinical Psychology with a focus in Neuropsychology so it hits very close to home from an educational perspective.  This diagnosis would be horrifying at any age, but at age 50 in the prime of your life and your career, it would be even more devastating.  I think the author made an excellent choice in choosing early-onset with a highly educated individual because it gave the reader a very clear understanding of the decline of Alice's cognitive abilities.<br /><br />I do have one small issue with the novel.  I find it very hard to believe that a professor of cognitive psychology at Harvard had such a limited knowledge of Alzheimer's Disease, the early-onset type, and the cognitive decline.  Perhaps, however, this was to properly explain the disease to the reader and make it more like we were experiencing the pain and discovery with Alice.  So, this aside, I am sticking to my 5 star rating.  Highly Recommended!!
B00181JGI2|5.0|I got a big kick out of this movie.  Jeff Bridges sets the standard for &#34;Laid Back&#34;. Lots of laughs.
B00EALI6IS|5.0|Great book, easygoing redaction and other hand of Nole history, it's an alternative that i think will use in short time
B002KDUDG6|5.0|Great CD!  Big fan of Michael Buble and highly recommend this CD.  I can listen to it over and over again.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|Best movie ever, has the greatest story you gotta see it... every second you are thinking what's going to happen next
B007WULJ5G|1.0|Trash. Not scary. Derivative. Boring. Bad storyline. Shock for the sake of shock. Worse money I've ever spent. Don't waste your time.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|The good guy wins.  An old fashioned idea but still a good one.  Well written, entertaining, and one of those books that you don't want to put down but don't want to end.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Google updated the device and got rid of the hack. the hack allowed you to view anything you wanted on the device not just netflix and chrome
B009RX85N0|4.0|Very entertaining, I get enjoyment trying to figure out who belongs with who. I  would recommend this to adults but not young children
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|It is extremely easy to use. Simple to maneuver around the app. Have not found anything wrong with the app!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved this book. The author is a great story teller with a gift for words. The reader will not want to put this book down until the very end.  All my friends are talking about it. Thank you Ms Moriarty for writing this enjoyable book.
B000HZD168|5.0|What can I say? Star Trek II is the best film that features the cast from TOS. The message in this film is quite simple: the effects of vengeance.
B009LQKHIO|1.0|Poorly edited book. Author has abused woman still with bruises and cast on her arm falling in love and having sex when she doesn't trust men.<br /> If author had done more research and used a reasonable timeline, the storyline might have been plausible.<br />Even for a kindle book, the number of typographical errors was high.  IN several spots it appeared that 2 attempts at the same paragraph were left in the final printing. Also there were at least 4 malaprop.
B0013WJGJ0|5.0|I grew up watching this film. To this day, I still watch it from time to time. Jack Nicholson's take on the Joker shattered the ceiling for the time and era this film was made, and Michael Keaton still stands out as one of the best actors to fill the role of Batman.
B005QPGHQU|5.0|Love the music, the lead's voice and the lyrics.  Perfect for when I'm in an introspective mood.  Good to go.
B00A3AUGEW|4.0|I like every song, I don't have to skip over any of them, which says a lot. It's very chill music, which I like. The album sounds a lot like the single, so there were no surprises.
B005I0DLXK|5.0|Once again, Rihanna rocked her groove.  It's great when you really like most every song on an album...like I did this one.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Pay outs could be more have been playing over a year now and still can't get all the gems for the crown I believe I never will at this pace
B001B67VR2|4.0|You can always count on Rihanna to give you your money's worth on her albums.  Plenty of fun and lots of driving beats to rock out to...
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Play it once and you'll be hooked, I had the kids play and I my battery in my kindle died. That was after a full charge.
B000W198QY|3.0|I love India.Arie's voice and the thoughtfulness of her lyrics.  For whatever reason tho, I wasn't blown away by this album.  It was a good, solid one but didn't knock my socks off...
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game. Easy to play. Helps keep my mind fresh and working. I look forward to every level. It is always exciting.
0316113514|3.0|Spark: The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise. I really appreciate Dr. John J. Ratey's work. It is essential for humans to understand how the body affects the brain and vice-versa . This book is very interesting since it integrates a neuroscientific introduction to the subject of physical activity/exercise and brain health, however, did the author missed the scientific references? Where is the references chapter? It would be extremely important if the author could correct this gap in the book. Further it would enhance readers knowledge by creating a bridge into exhaustive analysis. In addition, the book lacks references in the main content. If this book is entitled  \\"The Revolutionary New science of Exercise and the Brain\\"  where did the \\"New Science\\" went to?
B00DWZHTRW|5.0|Was surprised to see so many people didn't like it. Both my husband(who is had to please with movies) and I both loved it, as well as my teenage son.  Full of twists and turns.. a few things may be a little unrealistic but overall I was very entertaining.
B00D3CB41Q|5.0|I recommended to anybody like flamenco, jazz and the classic Spanish music all together so this is for you. Great just great.
B001MSMULG|5.0|The first of the Gabriel Allon series, this novel started me on a new collection (for me) of really good espionage thrillers.  What makes this series so different is that it's based on the reluctant exploits of an Israeli assassin who takes you on an intense ride through the cities of Europe and the post-WWII Middle East intrigue.  Take the time to get a list of the novels in the order they were published.  This is a series that builds as it goes along.  Good reads individually, better when enjoyed in sequence.
B00992CF6W|5.0|If you want a building game then the game for you is minecraft. (Creative)<br /><br />If you want a killing game then the game for you is minecraft.  ( survival)
B00006FDCD|5.0|i recieved the dvd in a timley maner, it arived in great shape , no damage or defects, played great! love the dvd, thanks would buy again A+++++++++++++
B008M721MS|4.0|This app is wonderful, you can see another person on the screen, and in a way, &quot;text&quot; them( IM ). The only minor problems is that sometimes the picture is a bit blurry, and rarely is the audio messed up. But that's it. Overall, this is a very good and reliable communication app, and not just for the price( which is free ). This is awesome, you need to get it. Oh, and you can also send pictures.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|i love the castle series, they are so fun to watch, i recieved this dvd in very good shape and it played great! shipping was really super fast! loved it , thanks
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I love this game. The only problem I have encountered is I have made small purchases for credits, (4 Times), and the screen froze. Didn't get my credits, and lost my money. Still waiting for a response from support.
B009NH6AOQ|4.0|Glad we decided to purchase. I return to watch over and over in preparation for Season IV. My daughter made me a fan!
B0067R0APK|1.0|I got stuck with a town not close to me and ...of course ...can not erase it  and no manual or instructions other than this it is ok
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I can't even- I've been rendered utterly speechless. This is without a doubt the most achingly beautiful, heartrending, real book I have ever read. I don't feel like there's an adequate description that could prepare anyone for the magic of love and the tragedy of loss that this story presents. Hazel and Augustus are so real and their story makes you, just, feel. Hazel knows she's terminal and has been for years, but when at one Cancer Kid Support Group she meets Augustus Waters, everything changes. Reading this story-as heartbreaking as it is-made me feel alive, and want to really live, you know? Thank you, John Green, for sharing this unbelievable story. I'm sorry to say that this is the first John Green book I've read, but rest assured it will not be the last. If you read any book I have reviewed and encouraged so far on this blog, this is the one you should read. 5/5 stars ;)
0440246318|1.0|Of course, Lee Child took this one to the bank and the South of France long before this review, but I have say something to clear my conscience. A Wanted Man will leave you wanting the real Jack Reacher instead of the callous shell that haunts this story.  Too many \\"Crown Vics,(I know two retired FBI agents and they never had to drive one) too much driving around, too many characters guessing about what is going on (it's still hard to say)too much sloshing around in the rain, and that's just the surface of the complaint here. Full disclosure: I've been addicted to the stories since discovering them a year ago and have looked forward to every new one, so this is difficult.<br />  Without spoiling the story, I just have to say that Child must be running out of ideas, since this one never goes anywhere and Reacher must have become hardened to everything, since the life he is avenging and the body he leaves behind is completely forgotten in the cheerful banter after the penultimate blood bath. Hey, they're Middle Eastern foreigners, so who cares, right?  It seems that the profiling here and the dehumanizing of the enemy has gone a little too far. For Reacher, and possibly for Child in their string of successes, it seems that everything and everyone is just collateral damage, that can be left behind by sticking out a thumb, or thumbing your nose at the world.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Although this is a young adult book, I read it and really liked it.  It read quick of course, but the content was so meaningful.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisholm did not disappoint me with this story line. There were many twists that kept me wanting to read more.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This is a very addictive game.  Only thing is that there is quite a wait to get back your lives to continue.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I've just reread The Fault in Our Stars, and found it to be a perfect book. Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters live with the reader after the book is done. This YA book is not just for a teenage audience.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I originally had this for my phone and was happy to find it available on the Kindle. The early levels are easy but don't let that fool you, it starts to get really hard. Some levels take me ten tries or more. I love it though and definitely recommend this as a free alternative to the well known jewel game.
B00003CXXP|1.0|I had hoped a second viewing years later would give me more insight into this movie. It is still too long, pretentious, disjointed and agonizingly slow moving. Some people seem to like this movie. I don't. I could go on writing about why I didn't like the plot, pace, ending, etc, but enough is enough.
B00AP9RQE4|3.0|It was fun to take a jaunt through someone other than Miles' stories, but unfortunately this story doesn't have quite as much depth as Ms. Bujold's other stories, and it almost didn't fit in given the differences in old characters.  For example, why is Ivan's mother suddenly &#34;Mamere&#34; all the time when previously he usually referred to her as &#34;M'mother&#34; (yes, I know, means same thing but that's the point of voices and continuity) or just &#34;Mother.&#34;  The love story was also fairly predictable, with certain characters being awfully clingy awfully quick, but perhaps that was the problem with not having a whole book like, Komarr, say, to develop the female's background.  It was nice to see another side of Simon too, but again, his character was just somewhat incongruous with previous renderings.  This story is supposed to allow him to develop more but there needed to be more development and not just sudden shifting.  Lastly, the sudden appearance of another planet at the end of the book was sort of the final straw.  Many other worlds had already been brought up in previous stories that would have been fun to leave a dangling introduction to at the end but why a whole new one?  The goal of the book seemed to be to turn everyone's (well, almost everyone, Lady Alys is as cool and collected as ever) characters upside-down, and not just individual characters but characterizations of particular groups as well.  It just didn't quite work to do that to EVERYONE all at once.  Worth a read, but, unlike some of the other Vorkosigan-universe books, I don't think I'll be revisiting this one anytime soon.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I don't usually read YA fiction but I was very impressed with the Hunger Games trilogy.  It has the fast pace and the simpler prose typical of YA fiction but it contains sophisticated themes and doesn't settle for a formulaic happy ever after ending.<br /><br />I loved all three books and have enjoyed reading the reviews.  I was surprised to see so many negative reviews for MJ compared to HG and CF.  Perhaps it's because MJ needs the context of the first two books to draw it together or that the first person narrative requires the reader to work harder to 'fill in the blanks'.  I recommend that the trilogy is read as a single novel, going straight from one to the other.  And while the fast pacing and the need to find out what happens next encourages the reader to zip through it, slow down a little so that you don't miss important clues.  The author has been accused of 'rushing' it, but I suspect the blame mostly lies with the reader, going by some of the reviews.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Great movie! The movie has a great message as well.  I ordered Despicable Me II today and I can't to see it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|like I said ammmmmmaaaaazzzzzziiiiinnnnnnnggggggg!!!<br />at night after school all I do is despicable me. great fun for whole familey injoy this app. 1 bad thing is it takes a lot of megabites.
B004SH40BQ|3.0|Works well with my iPod classic. Only draw back is the audio somewhat is compressed. Can hear the difference over plugging the iPod directly to a Bose dock.
B007TMON8M|3.0|I like the idea. I'll play it. Have some success. I will get to a point where I get frustrated because there are no clues on how to improve my structure, so I quit.
B00E978FGQ|4.0|Caught my attention from the beginning and kept me on the edge of my seat till the end. I would recommend this to everyone.  Not a big magic fan but this was entertaining and fast paced.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|Fast paced motion is OK, but to vary the speed from time to time would enhance this game, especially for someone trying it for the first time.
B000GWE44U|4.0|Everyone knows Stephen King hated Stanley Kubrick's movie version of his classic horror novel. But Kubrick has been known to take certain parts and mold them into his OWN version (for example Lolita, 2001, etc.). Even though it strays pretty far from the novel, it packs a punch because that is what Kubrick did best, make engrossing films! Although you may have trouble following some of the plot and others may interpret it differently, you can still enjoy the madness that builds along the way. Some have criticized Jack Nicholson's performance as over the top, but I like it even more after each viewing.<br /><br />I recently reread the book and saw both movies again (the t.v. mini series that King wrote and produced) and each of them has it's own place. So if you like horror movies, put this on your list. But maybe you should NOT read the novel first and enjoy it for what it is, a stand alone horror classic.
B003QS9WIE|5.0|Nolan is quickly becoming one of my favorite directors. His movies are always well done with smart scripts. The Prestige doesn't disappoint. It ranks highly - up there with The Dark Knight and Inception.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|this is a purfect book for looking up words you would no now. if you dont no a word you could just look it up in Oxford American Dictionary
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Season three is a MUST watch!!! Can't wait till Season 4 comes out!!! Daryl is awesome!!!! Zombies Zombies Zombies and MORE!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|We all love this game ,the whole family gets involved in saving the animals<br />And the graphics are great! We liked it so much we put it on both devices.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is very good. I am enjoying playing it on my Kindle Fire. Thank you Mobility Ware for a great simple game of Solitare. Most days I just want to play a simple game and this fits the bill nicely.<br /><br />Thanks again.
B009NYF2ES|4.0|Songs were excellent and there was no singing dialogue, which I hate.  Could have been a little shorter but it took some time to build the story.  It is more a character study anyway.  The only problem I had was that although it was a Blu-ray, the picture was so-o-o grainy.  I expected much better resolution.
B00F91RYL8|1.0|This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  I cannot believe Brad Pitt lent his name to this terrible movie.  Zombies?  Can't Hollywood come up with anything better?
B00BUADSMQ|3.0|Simply put, it is the worst of the franchise.  Less humor, less story, less character.  It may have played better to a younger audience, but my wife and I were disappointed.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|Well acted and entertaining movie.  Interesting story line and worth a rental.  I will recommend it to family and friends.
B003JH8LPW|5.0|I like the author, and the book topic is of interest to me due to the current events regarding internet security.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This app has done everything I needed it to do in order to make my desktop portable on my Kindle!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Always like to have and use a good game of solitaire to pass the time. It makes you use your mind and keeps it sharp.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Right off the bat it solves a problem of my accessing Netflix with close captioning with my Tivo. I won't go into those problems here other than to say they disappear after a short time along with the ability to remotely control.<br />Chromecast is easy to setup and easy to control from both my iMac and iPad. I did have less luck with the iPhone 4S that may have been due to the smaller screen, time will tell. It will be very interesting to see where Google takes this in the future but at the price was a worthwhile work around for me short term. I have an original Apple TV and cannot see the effects of the recent upgrade and with rumors of a new version coming next month I may buy that depending on what it has to offer and give the Chromecast away. The recent upgrade on the Apple TV sounds really good. Of course a full blown Apple television would be an interesting development and have the potential of obsoleting both Apple TV and Chromecast.<br />A problem when watching a Netflix TV series the next episode is not just a click away. Need to go back into the app and start over. Got to believe and/or hope this will be fixed in the future.
B009G41CG2|4.0|Very good to pass the time. makes you use your mind and wits to finish the game this is the first time I have tried it and I like it.
B001QJUX24|4.0|The running time for this movie was approx. 2 hours but is notably one of the best Western flicks of all time. The story was very well done (1956). I was required to watch it for my Genres in Film liberal arts class. You should see it!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It was challenging and often frustrating, to try to figure out let alone understand some of the puzzles, but fun at the same time.
B00BMNM4H6|3.0|Sugar, sugar is a fun little game. It makes you do a lot of thinking and its fun to pass the time in a relaxing way. It also has a pretty cool sandbox mode. For things I did not like: the design and graphics were a little low quality; it did not have a lot of variety in the gameplay that I have seen in other similar games such as different kinds of &#34;grains&#34; like sand and snow with different qualities.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Easy to use. I like how the books sync from my cellular device to my tablet. My place is always saved.
B00D2ZF3GQ|2.0|I'm a pretty easy going person and I approached this movie not expecting too much. I'll just go straight to the critiques. For those that haven't watched the movie, I'll try to censor the spoilers:<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- A lot of people felt Jaden Smith's acting to be not so good, but I thought most of the scenes that he was in was okay (in other words...I was expecting it, especially after seeing the Karate Kid which I didn't like either). I see some improvement in his acting and I too wish he would one day become as talented as his father. I'm a Will Smith fan and I mainly watched this movie for Will Smith but I was willing to give his son a chance. I understand that Will Smith is trying hard to give his son a strong chance in the acting career, he's doing everything a father can do to give his kids the leverage that they need. He loves his family and he's doing what he can and I admire that. Being a bystander, sometimes we are quick to criticize him of stuff like nepotism but he's a father that's a famous actor, what did you expect? Any father would probably do the same.<br /><br />- I'm not yet much of a Jaden Smith fan, but seeing him in this movie definitely made me think of Will Smith and there were scenes where I did feel that charismatic presence coming from his son. I don't think his son will be as fun to watch as his father but I hope he proves me wrong.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- I'm going to flat out and say I blame this film's mediocrity not on Jaden Smith but on M. Night Shyamalan. I think most of M. Night's movies are overrated.<br />- The narration with Jaden Smith in the beginning didn't feel right. His voice moves me AWAY from the movie.<br />- The trailer shows pretty much all the action scenes. Many times I feel like the person that made the trailer should be the person that makes the movies, it's just so much more exciting. The better the trailer and/or the more action scenes they show in the trailer, the more you expect the film to be not so great. They're desperate for advertisement that they're basically throwing everything good about the movie into the trailer to hype up the potential moviegoers.<br />- The planet that they land on, don't expect a world you haven't seen before, or creative interesting sci fi creatures. Eagles, lions, apes, even the plant life. Only the Ursa is different from the rest and even they're not that creative (they look like what you see in Lord of the Ring). This was one big reason why I was disappointed. I was expecting a fantasy world, but pretty much everything that's seen in the trailer is everything you'll see in the movie pretty much.<br />- SPOILER ALERT thereisascenewhereheisalmostfrozenaftertheraftscene. And he gets saved by an eagle that is smart enough to drag him into a hole and then cover up the hole with foliage AND THEN spread itself out over the spot in order to keep Kitai (Jadan) alive? Yeah F right haha...why would the eagle also remain on the ground and not fly off with Kitai instead?<br />- Alright we just have to bring up the Ursas. The blind creatures that can smell human pheromones when humans are scared. The movie doesn't really explain what made them such a threat to human kind. They're just introduced as large creatures that smell human fear and go after them, but they don't look special or anything. Cypher Raige (Will Smith) took out one with one swipe to the throat, they didn't seem special. The movie just doesn't elaborate on it. Also, if they can smell human fear that comes off our bodies, what about people in another room or people in suits that are airtight? I'm just watching the movie and it makes no sense as to why they're so fearful. Giant monsters...got it.<br />- Will Smith's part is lacking in this movie, you can tell he tries to leave the significant parts to his son. Will Smith's acting is also toned down, not sure exactly why but it didn't capture me like it usually does (or maybe I just wasn't in the mood or something).<br/><br />There are other complaints but I'll leave it here, the main ones are covered I believe. The story is slow, the acting kept me away from being absorbed into the movie, and the planet that they crash landed and how boring it was down there left me very unsatisfied. I was surprised that it was a 130 million dollar movie.
B0086700CM|5.0|To me I think that it is very fun and addicting!<br />But my nephews really enjoy this game when I'm over so I'm glad they made this game free!
B0076DEJMO|4.0|Nice solid book but not his best.  The book did feature the return of my favorite Abercrombie character which helped a lot in my giving it 4 stars.  Shy was a fine character but she reminded me too much of Monza Murcatto.  Also, I loved  Cosca in other books but really hated the bugger (and not in a good way) in this one which kinda dragged the book down  for me.  The best news it is appears at the end of the book that this has all been a good set up for what is shaping up to be a rousing continuation of the stories about the continued fight for control of the North with all of our favorite characters now in place for the next chapter in their saga.
B00CXAAG6I|3.0|I will have to admit that I hadn't met Grumpy Cat until ordering this book, and was expecting something like the Cat Who books. Grumpy Cat soon had me smiling, as he is one of a kind.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I can't wait for the next season.  This series captures you with the wonderful characters well chosen for the challenges of the time period. This season was just as good as the last two!
B001NHNG64|5.0|Thanks for another great book. I enjoyed the read and am grabbing the next one. Can't wait to see how Reacher gets out of the next one
B006IYG5HE|1.0|Couldn't even get half way through. Boring and hard to follow. I've loved all his other books, but not this one.
159463176X|3.0|I really loved the first two books by this author, I think they are classics and will be viewed that way for many years to come; Beautifully written with a clear message. I was so excited to get this book but I don't feel that it is in league with the other two. It's a novel, just a novel, and the other two seemed like much more than that. Other readers said that they couldn't put the book down, well I could and I did so, often for a week at a time. I'll think twice before I buy the next one.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|Love the series and enjoy watching the reruns also!  Enjoy the scripts of all the shows.  Need more like this on TV.
B00C5XBAOA|3.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1KU5MWYJJT8XH]]Sofia the First is one of the most popular shows on Disney Junior. Sofia and her friends Clover, Mia, and her family (Amber and James) learn about being royalty and importance of being kind.  We have used several of the Sofia the First story lines as life lessons for our 4 year old daughter.... things like inviting everyone to birthday parties and why it is important to always be kind. Therefore, my wife and I really don't mind our daughter watching Sofia the first (or really... any of the Disney Junior shows like Jake and the Never Land Pirates and Doc McStuffins)<br /><br />The Mattel line of Sofia the First toys received criticism when they were first released. Fortunately, they have made a number of improvements to many of the toys, and while they are still far from perfect they are now at least *acceptable* in terms of build quality. The Sofia the First Royal Family gift set was improved - initially all of the dolls heads popped off - very easily. In this updated set (purchased in September 2013) the heads remain firmly attached to the royal family members!<br /><br />Notes<br /><br />- Comes with Sofia the First, Amber, James, Queen Miranda, and King Roland.<br /><br />- Not sure why they designed it this way, but it is difficult to make King Roland, James, and Amber to stand on their own - even on hard surfaces.<br /><br />- Sofia the First and Amber speak when used when used with the base of the Sofia the First Magical Talking Castle. King Roland and James interact with the castle but only play music.... Queen Miranda does not interact with the castle.<br /><br />- As mentioned, Mattel has improved the dolls and the heads no longer pop off.<br /><br />Final Verdict  - While the Sofia the First Royal Family has been improved it still could use a better design. I am not sure why Mattel designed the set where it is difficult for most of the family to stand on their own. It would also be nice if all of the members worked with the Sofia the First Magical Talking Castle (instead of just Sofia and Amber)<br /><br />3 1/2 Starsthe First Magical Talking Castle (instead of just Sofia and Amber)<br /><br />3 1/2 Stars
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|This is a classic version, not much strategy to it, just a time filler for waiting, and helps improve eye and hand motion. There is a variety of different puzzle styles and stacks.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Works as it should. Good way to pass the time. No trouble with loading. Doesn't freeze up like some other similar games.
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|Again, a good action movie, but the characters were either thin or in the case of Schwarsenegger, showing his age, and I mean badly.  Even his lines were pathetic.  Of course, his volunteer posse prevailed against some well armed and trained bad guys, as usual.  Even Arnold's final fight on the bridge was just about the last straw in a movie that tried too hard to make him look the super hero.
B009LDXQGW|5.0|I purchased this cd as a gift for someone and never herd of this guy until then, so in lite of that I went back and purchased it for myself.
