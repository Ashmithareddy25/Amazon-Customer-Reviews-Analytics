B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I got this app on my kindlefire and my granny's and no glitches at all. if you like dragons this is the app of you dreams. it is cute and amazing. love it!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Characters, setting, plot, all intriguing and magnetic. If I had a reservation it would be that some of the justifications for the setting are a little weak and that some of the characters seem to occasionally act in order to advance the story, not like themselves.<br /> But these are small issues against a rich and enjoyable trip. If you haven't tried Wool and Shift, give them a read.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|awesome game fun for the whole family my 2 year old cant get enough of it and neither can I !
B000HKYOK0|5.0|I loved these shows growing up, and it's been years since I've watched them.  Watching them again, older and arguably a little wiser, I'm amazed at how intelligent the writing is.  Almost every episode adroitly deconstructs a social or political issue, disguising it in the context of an idealized, almost utopian future.  At the same time, they are simply fun.  In addition, you can watch them with little ones around without having to worry about having to make any uncomfortable explanations.  If you haven't seen these shows, or it's been a spell since you have, don't pass up on them!
B00B99KJR0|5.0|This is the best match 3 game I have played. Lots of levels and each one is unique. Difficult if you want to get 3 stars (high score) on each level
B00985E3UG|5.0|This book tells you everything these food company does to hook you on their products to increase their bottom line.
B003PBB4ME|5.0|I bought this to help stabilize my HD video when shooting with my point and shoot camera. Its very durable and I find myself using it almost anytime I use the camera. Its a great price for a great product. I highly recommend it.
B0090P98Z4|3.0|Free to play but stuffed with so far non-required purchases. Contains in game adds both on start up and menus. Controls are a bit wonky at times with the block skill needing to be more responsive. Crashes regularly on my kindle fire requiring a restart of the device for smooth playing. However, it is free and worth a try because it is enjoyable. Even more enjoyable than not at times.
B004OR199G|5.0|I was dx with Stage 3 breast cancer at the age of 35 and since have been eating raw for almost 2 years.  This book has a wonderful outlook on life from nutritional eating and why, loving life to its fullest, and very easy and extremely tasty recipes.  I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to change their life for the better.  And if you have a disease or medical condition, why not try a different approach to your health.  See what outcomes you get.  It doesn't hurt.
0785163182|4.0|The paperback version of Avengers vs X-Men contains ONLY AVX 0-12 and material from Point One. Although the product information states that it also includes AVX: VS 1-6, AVX: Infinite 1, 6, and 10, and a code for a digital copy, these only come with the hardcover edition.<br />I purchased the paperback through preorder from Amazon Prime and received it the day of its release, like promised and it was fine, although I think Amazon should mail paperbacks with some kind of protection rather than just an envelope, but other than that, no complaints. I was disappointed that the hardcover material was not included, but for $20, more than 13 comics worth of material is still a steal especially considering the cover price of the book is $35. You'll get your money's worth purchasing the paperback, but if you want the other material you may want to invest in the hardcover.<br />The Infinite comics in the hardcover edition are especially interesting because they have previously only been available through the Marvel Comics app. I'm not sure how they would look in print, because the Infinite comics are designed to work more like animation than normal comics, but the stories in them may be worth reading even if the innovative format of the comics doesn't translate to print.<br />In regards to the AVX story, its pretty good. It seems like Marvel's most creative ideas happen outside the Marvel universe in the miniseries like Marvel Zombies or some of the other post-apocalyptic stories that take unusual turns and drastically change characters and plotlines. The writers are overly careful with the Marvel universe, however, and often reverse a lot of the impact some of the stories have, such as how major characters are always written back in to the universe (Captain America's death?). AVX is certainly better than Fear Itself, which was weird and had almost no impact at its conclusion, but AVX may not be quite as good as the Dark Reign/Siege arc which eliminated an interesting character and resolved the Asgard conflict. Though AVX certainly does not live up to the brilliant Civil War arc, it gets a lot of things right. AVX resolves the Phoenix and Mutant Messiah conflicts in decent fashion and further develops the fate of an important X-Man and the mutant/homo-sapien politics. At the end, AVX attempts to lead the Marvel universe in to a new age (Marvel NOW). Whether or not it is successful remains to be seen.
0525478817|5.0|One of the most touching, brave, sweet and smart books I've ever read. And I have read a few. Must-read.
B0095P33IW|5.0|Love this movie, great movie to pass some time with.  Know it so well that I can unload the dishwasher or grab a load of Landry or do other things around the house and still know what going on to finish watching with a cup of coffee and a snack.

B000O8OTNC|4.0|This little sharpener does a great job of putting an edge back on a dulled blade.  You can't expect it to perform like an Apex or high end sharpening system.  But for a tool to have in the backpack or the glove box to restore a good quick edge to your knife this thing is definitely nice to have around.  Personally I like the plastic case of this one as well because its lighter than some of the metal ones I've come across, which will help reduce a little weight if your a backpacker.
B00AFEY354|5.0|I really like this movie. The cast is Emma Watson, Logan Lerman and Ezra Miller have great chemistry, and the movie includes enough humor to balance the complicated subject matter.
B008TT7CXW|5.0|Very convenient, works great, SD cards are secure.  No complaints!<br /><br />Only wish there was a version with all SD cards slots, not as many micro SD.
B001HM1PFO|4.0|This is a very good movie. I recommend it for anyone looking for a weird time, you certainly need to be in a special mood to see it.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|This certainly holds your interest.  You are in a fantasy world but it seems very real.  You can identify with the characters.
1616550414|5.0|This is a wonderful insight into the Legend of Zelda series. It is a view into the process of art and character design. Also, I've been waiting for a series timeline for about a decade, so that's always nice to get.
B005LAIGPA|3.0|Little actual story content, mostly  visual effects.  This film might interest the pre-teen set, but as far as adult entertainment it is definitely lacking.
B0065GC0BA|4.0|A excellent read which addresses some serious moral issues and individual rights to make our own decisions to the very end.
B005LAIIHG|4.0|An entertaining story with really great animation for the tiger.....a film that you wouldn't mind seeing twice. This one will definitely go into my dvd collection.
B0060D3742|5.0|Excellent family movie for all members.  Reflects large amount family that protray how different families deal life obstacles.  Encourages children to use their imagination and dreams in daily life.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Daniel Day-Lewis was a most believable Lincoln, a superb performance! The period clothing and sets were well thought out before filming and greatly contributed to the over-all enjoyment of the viewer. It made you feel as though you were there and watching history being made.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This is a great game with a scenario that can entirely happen. It is a great game for people who like challenges and strategic games. This is a must have game!
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|This is his best CD ever from beginning to end, I love every song on it! I highly recommend it.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I spend a lot of time traveling this is an outstanding pass time.  It has good graphics ad super sound effects.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love it because you can have your own little dragon. then you can breed differnet ones to make really cute dragons.So I give it 2 thumb up.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I spend a lot of time traveling.  This game is a really good pass time.  Outstanding graffics and good effects.
6305076995|2.0|I was really disappointed in this. First it is only 74 minutes long. YES played in 1972 for about 3 hours when you saw them. This video has crappy sound and visuals. You get about four songs taken out of a concert and that has no context. A real rip off.
0743270754|5.0|The book is a great read for any history lover out there. Also the shipping and handling was good , the book came to my house in great shape.
B003YWUTKM|5.0|I had never imagined David Gilmour doing anything with Alex Paterson, but when you listen to the finished product, it's like the perfect Pink Floyd album side in many ways.  This excellent and soulful composition brings out not only the most mournful and triumphant moments Gilmour can create, but also showcases Paterson's deep understanding of the feeling carried within that music.  A must have for all Floyd fans and Orb-sessives!
B006GHA9QQ|3.0|Disappointing in some ways.  it does not have the dramatic depths and contrasts of Phantom.  The young boy singer was excellent, however, as was the phantom.
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|Great acting, thrilling, exciting. Interesting to see how it's feasible for law enforcement to manipulate the system and bypass legal measures to get the job done for good and bad.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|I read only half the book and finally got tired of the great detail involved and the generally old style of writing.
B000FA675C|5.0|One of my favorite genres of literature is historical drama and this book fits the bill. I am particularly enthralled by religious drama involving the history of Catholicism. This is the second time I've read this novel (as well as seeing the movie) and I enjoyed it as much the second time.Get it now on your Kindle.Also order Angels and Demons by Dan Brown.Excellent book.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|HOWEVER it just proves that I cant drive at high speeds.  Practice makes perfect I guess. Love the choice of Tilting. or touch screen.
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|I'm a huge Disney Movie Fan and Blu-ray collector, but this is outrageous!!! Putting out separate editions of one film like this...having just the 3D version and a digital copy and then having to put out more money just to buy the 2D version. Disney wake up and be generous to your fan base because 3D is awesome to watch but 2D is what most families will end up replaying with the once in awhile 3D, put them in combo packs. You already make so much profit off of your hardcore fan base, so stop trying to bleed us dry! I am not happy with this. It makes me want to cancel my pre-order of the 2D Blu-ray version just because of it.
1401937268|5.0|Perhaps a trifle difficult to shuffle for those with smaller hands, but still most assuredly an awesome deck.  thank you
B000SLP4SE|5.0|the filmmaker of this movie tried quite hard to make the plot make sense.  a very thrilling wild west movie
B00138KHF6|5.0|It's catchy, hooky, and well written. Totally different from everything he did with Iron Maiden up to this point. Dickinson is a brilliant song writer and this album is no exception.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This game is addictive.  Can play for hours.  Highly recommend it to those who played solitaire and are looking for something more challenging.
B00992CF6W|5.0|BEST GAME EVERI love it because it is like living in the real world on an island. I love this app
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|'have seen it three times - awesome film, splendid story, moving performance, recommended for all ages - the movie that has it all
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Filled with all kinds of acton one of me and my dads favorite books of all time.Look no further for the next Harry potter book.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|So cool and his back up band was amazing.  I loved the guests. I will order the next CD when I can afford it.
B005HED11Y|5.0|great to be able to watch in order. the remastered episodes look great. my son and I are truly enjoying being able to watch together.
B00899F0G8|5.0|The video quality is very good. The only thing that bugged me is it doesn't let you purchase the next show in the actual Amazon Instant Video app. But other than that it was awesome
B00AB7HESI|3.0|I have played this game before, and it's really fun. I didn't listen to the bad reviews, but this game truly is a pain to install on kindle. After finishing, it says there was an error.
B0086VWCPG|1.0|I downloaded this app and noticed that some of the features: the 3 icons on the main screen (weather, sun, and temperature) and the Map don't load anything.  The map just shows me as a blue dot on a grid, the map never loads.  I read in support for runtastic that this bug is fixed in a newer version... excellent, I'll just update it!  But alas I can't.  Amazon does not show or allow any update, so I'm stuck with lots of blank parts in my app.
B006O6F932|5.0|Very good product quality, this is all I expected to get.<br />I recommend to other buyers those are thinking to buy that.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|What a good series! I can not wait for season three to be included in amazon prime! It is a must watch.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|I enjoyed Flight, but I did not consider it great.  I am not sure why I did not like it more than I did.  I had enjoyed Unstoppable, another recent Denzel Washington movie, more.  I think the whole alcohol/drug angle did not work well.  I believe that as a pilot he would not have been flying very long as an alcoholic in the real world.
B00A4A2N6K|5.0|I love her music and this album made me even more in love with it.  Take this album home or download it, it is definitely worth it.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|A realistic bingo game that goes fast and isn't boring like some of the other bingo game. The only thing is the callers accent sometimes a little difficult to understand but do have a display as numbers are pulled.
B008Y768XO|5.0|Great story and our 5 year old granddaughter loved it, too. We would certainly recommend it. Now we're looking for the Japanese version from the eighties.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read!<br /> I just love the romance between Katniss and Peeta. Just amazing!
B008602KQI|3.0|Easily predictable. Just another teenager love story retold again and again. Missing emotional engagement between characters and lacking story depth.
B0077EBWVI|3.0|This movie is OK - not as good as the original.  Of course, since it did not have Kevin Bacon in it, to be better or as good was going to be difficult.  The dancing could never be better than the original.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|The movie followed the book closely, which was much appreciated in this case. Great costumes and casting. Can't wait to see the next chapter!
B0070Y46UY|3.0|OK Read. The beginning seemed to drag a bit but it picked up once it reached part 2. It didn't invoke any deep thought or spiritual analysis as I expected from the other reviews though.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Solid version with good configuration options. Ads display between games and are easy to clear. Great graphics and motion. Recommended!
B000FA675C|5.0|This book was a page turner... It was thoroughly enjoyable and I especially enjoyed all of the art history information in addition to the religious mystery.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I like it! The puzzles are like those I do on a table but with multiple levels of difficulty (numbers of pieces).
B0044C3RB4|5.0|This series just keeps getting better and better.<br />Stories are very well tied together, acting is perfect.<br />Need to see more like this and sequels.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I must say, I think they could've come up with a much better cliff-hanger. Instead of having the family journey up to Scotland, why didn't they just pack everyone up and send them to Moldavia, then gun them all down during a royal wedding and leave us wondering who might live and who might die?<br /><br />On a more serious note... I'm absolutely addicted to this program and would tolerate just about any story lines they come up with. Still, you can tell they've gotten to cranking up the &#34;drama&#34; knob thinking it's necessary to keep the viewers engaged and interested. I just hope it doesn't venture into &#34;Melrose Place&#34; or even &#34;Dynasty&#34; territory, if you know what I mean. Although that could be fun in its own right.
B009NPA3Q4|4.0|A lot of the songs seem similar but it is good music to have on in the background and you do busy work.  Phillip has such a soothing voice.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|This show has definitely jumped the shark in season 3.<br />As an artistic endeavor, it should have ended after season 1.  That would have been poetic and bleakly honest to its conceit.<br />Season 2 was ok, although the show began violating or just ignoring its own internal logic.<br />By season 3, it really devolves into a soap opera where the walking dead are just a sideshow and a convenient way to advance certain plot points, but the focus is on interpersonal dramas.  In my opinion, that is not very compelling, since most of the characters are 2 dimensional caricatures.
B00AEUPOVQ|5.0|Every time I watch this movie, I enjoy seeing Anne become prettier with each scene after the Captain comes back into her life.  Excellent acting.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I love the book, however in some places it takes slower reading mainly because I really want to understand as much as possible.  I do believe that NDEs exist and occur more often than we know or are willing to admit.  Many have difficult hearing or, should I say, listening to experiences as related.
B0029LCJJS|4.0|Even though you know the basic story the characters and intrigue make foe a fascinating show. This can become addicting.
B000CNFC76|5.0|This is a good story for family consumption.  I will show it to my grandchildren.  It is also interesting to see that era of golf.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Its a surprisingly good game with pretty good graphics. its easy to care for the horse and ride. Its also fun to shop for new equipment and clothing.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My grand kids love this game. They are 4 and 7 and caught on very quickly. Great entertainment for them.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Very well done, a great job of taking us back in history...<br />The acting and characters were excellent!<br />Very entertaining.
B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|I'm in the process of delving into this dieting suggestion.  I have thought many times that this kind of eating might be possible and good for weight loss and maintenance.  I will be trying this plan.
B0058VW36U|3.0|The grandchildren enjoy this game,but I can't seem to advance to higher levels. Perhaps because I prefer word or card games.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What an engrossing story!  From the very beginning it had my full attention.  I love a good science fiction story that isn't full-on, technical, hard sci-fi.  What a great book to relax with.  I love the characters and hope to read more of their stories.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|It's easygoing and simple. But there were times I thought I was reading the same thing over and over again. Not a bad book.
0062238868|4.0|While he just answering the calling of his country, Chris made history as the top US sniper.  This book outlines the battles overseas and at home as a solider tries to stay alive and preserve his life at home.  The passages from his wife are great insights into what the spouse is thinking/feeling as they anxiously respond to what each phone call might bring.  Seeing battle in the eyes of Chris is going to give every US citizen greater respect for what these men and women do overseas.  There is some glory to found  in this story but there is loss and reconciliation.  No man/woman wants to be told their time is up and leave their friends behind as the battles rage on.  Chris has some lessons for everyone...military or not.
B0094M2H2E|5.0|I love buying & downloading movies on my daughters kindle fire hd. She can watch them on the go with no wifi. Tinkerbell movies are her favorite!!
B00BKTFABE|2.0|Perhaps the reason that I don't like it is because I am a new user. I had difficulty figuring out how to move a pic around where I wanted it, such as the album or to send it to someone.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I liked this book a lot because of all the fast-paced action going on when they are doing the missions and I also liked the steps of all the training
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is a wonderful show and I love it.  I got hooked very quickly.  I'm ready to start season three and can't wait!
B004GUSG4M|3.0|So so. Plot was ok.<br />In the end though, I think it was too improbable, though the characterizations were interesting.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|If you are need for this type of USB Cable then this is the one.  I've had several other brands, but not are as good as this one.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|I play this a lot.  I like to get a high score for the second star.  I usually don't move on until I do.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This series sneaked up on me. Each episode is interesting in its own right, and the underlying story along with its character developments make it compelling from episode to episode.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Just a good watch. Keeps a person interested and wanting to know the outcome. AND THANKS TO PRIME NO COMMERCIALS!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Very enjoyable game. Three levels of dificulty and plenty of hints if you need them. I recomend this game if you like solving puzzles.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|I felt like I was reading the screen play for the 1990s &#34;Sleeping with the Enemy&#34; movie starring Julia Roberts
B001F6TXME|4.0|The only negative thing i could say is that it doesn't come with complete directions on how to use it and 1 meter doesnt seem short but it is.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I play this a lot.  Switch back and forth with other games when I get frustrated but like to try for a higher score.
B0013D8LCW|4.0|This is one of the better \\"coming out\\" movies in that it is easy to identify with the feelings, the complications, and the misunderstandings a guy can experience when he begins to seriously and honestly consider his orientation.  It deals with the issues tenderly and yet honestly.  The physical connections are engaging and true to life.  It is set around lovely beach settings also!<br /><br />If the viewer is considering his orientation and questioning the possible joys and consequences thereof, this should be added to his must-have's.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|I found it to be fun the quicker you get will be great for granddaughters.So as far as I am concearned great for anyone who likes fast pace games.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is without question the best show on television. Excellent development of the characters. Maggie's Smith portrayal and some of the lines they give her are amazing.
B0076UXKDG|4.0|Its nice to have another shutter release and greater ability to grip the camera.  The grip is well constructed, but seems too expensive for what it is.
B000I186FW|5.0|THIS IS BY FAR THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER MADE! WORTH WATCHING. WORTH BUYING, WORTH BEING OBSESSED WITH IT FOR YEARS LATER
B004MNO0BQ|3.0|I play it once in a while but it doesn't keep my interest.  I left it on my Kendal for the grand kids to play.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|Should be in every family's video library.  Not only is this a great story but it is a real opportunity to talk about moral and life issues with children.
B004S3MB2U|5.0|It has tons of uses. All of the different calculators are very helpful. This is by far the best calculator app there is.
B00BF123WG|3.0|The TV version was better. The plot line developed way too slowly. I was expecting better character development around thye main character.
B005XZR4NI|1.0|It would not okay in any DVD player. The case was also broken in pieces. We also tried playing it in the XBOX as well and it did not read it.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Great timing by all the players. Scripts well written. Kept me in the show because of the dynamic &#34; cat and mouse&#34; intrigues of all the characters.
B00165Q12Y|5.0|Lovely Shirley has a crystal voice and brings a lot of energy to this album.  I remember her singing one of the James Bond theme songs and was enchanted by her.  Think you will love this album.
B00466HN72|5.0|Good any time of the year. Children love the story even though it's basically an Easter story.  Very colorful and enticing.
B0066WJLU6|4.0|This thing will blind you, it's so bright. The perfect aid to getting your keys in the door at night.
B00942G4UA|4.0|This documentary is eye opening. You don't realize how the government and big food has taken over one of the fundamentals of life-food.
1476734941|5.0|After 4 weeks I've already lost 1 inch. The recipes are good. They're very filling and you get plenty of food to keep you satisfied throughout the day. I highly recommend this book.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Allow me to preface by stating I do not read any novels in the genre of crime-thrillers or mystery/suspense, etc. I prefer stories set in alternate, fantastical timelines in which, although people may do hideous things to reach other, is due to this alternate reality. You can't really blame rebels who plot and murder to escape a dystopian society can you?<br /><br />Gone Girl takes me out of this daydream \\"comfort zone\\" and paints a very believable and hence terrifying picture of domestic bliss gone wrong.  The narrative style was if not unique, brilliant in delivering some of the most introspective, disturbing insights of the human psyche.<br /><br />I now consider this a cautionary tale of gender, marital, and even an individual's societal roles as it affects others.  Are we bring genuine to reach other or just acting out as expected?<br /><br />Gillian Flynn had done an excellent job of pulling the reader through this rollercoaster ride of suspense and intrigue doling out small pieces of a complex plot at a time. Some have stated they did not like the ending but I found it apropo, quite like a tragic French film.<br /><br />Anyone who appreciates a fresh twist in their fiction will enjoy this story.  Then follow it up with something light and fluffy to elevate your psyche up from the chasm into which it had delved in order to sympathize with these characters.
B009RH9J7W|5.0|After reading some of the reviews I had concerns regarding the &#34;fit&#34; for the Fire HD and the &#34;sudden flip open&#34; scenario due to the construction of the case, but ordered for the great price anyway. I am happy to report that the fit was perfect and I have only had the &#34;sudden flip open&#34; scenario happen a few times due to my negligence of not keeping my thumb on the edge while playing a game and quickly rotating the case...but the Fire HD stayed in snugly each time. By simply using the hand hold strap and keeping a thumb on the edge this scenario can be averted totally. As far as the left hand right hand thing for controls goes you can turn the Kindle around a full 180 degrees in the case to get the controls where you want them during use and flip it back around with the ports to the outside whenever you need to charge it with the case closed. As far as the sudden flip open scenario goes and an &#34;engineering&#34; assessment, I noted what happens when the case unfolds quickly, and believe the physics involved would preclude the Fire HD from actually coming out of the case...as the sudden jerk from the weight occurs after the case has fully opened the Fire ends up with its longest edge pointing to the ground, not the flat screenside or backside so minimal force is actually applied to the bracket's retaining edges. I further believe it would take a force of purposely &#34;slinging&#34; it open with forceful intent to actually dislodge the kindle from the heavy duty plastic holding bracket keeping it in the case. I'm not saying it couldn't happen but I believe it would be highly unlikely. That being said I highly recommend the case as it is attractive, well built, multi-position capable, very functional and an outstanding deal if you can get it for under $20 like I did.
B005S9EK5Y|1.0|Someone should add to the title that this crap is a musical and not waste our time till we find out
B00594XOZU|5.0|Everything you could want in a messenger service. Free texting, group chats, picture and media exchange, real time updates, contact management. I'm extremely satisfied with kik - my favorite part is that it notifies you in the background rather than interrupting or crashing your current focus.
B005DJREGQ|1.0|This starts off with a girl losing her virginity and the guy telling her they can't hang once school starts. This show is about teen sex, teen bullying and parents who have a blind spot to the issues. Our society's morals are in the toliet and this show supports it, this show is trash TV. I would not recommend it to anyone.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|That book is really amazing. An emotional rollercoaster that deserves to be read. I loved it and will definitely recommend this book to my friends
B009IUH1N2|5.0|This game was the free app of the day at one point, and I decided to try it on a whim.  What a great acquisition for my device.  I love the easy flow and challenges of the game, and my children love laughing at me when I hit an obstacle.  If you like Mario and other side-scrolling challenge games, this one is for you!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Loads of information...lots of ideas! If you can think it up, you're more than likely to find lots of it! Love Pinterest!
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|This is indeed a working calculator. Wish it had some real features, seeing as how you can use it on handheld computers a graphing feature would be nice.
B009IF8CH6|3.0|There are too many characters vying for screen time.  Four nerds and a young attractive female neighbor was good.  Adding Bernadette to the cast was OK.  Adding Amy to the cast was one too many cast members.  Raj's character is very underdeveloped.  There is a point where a series show outgrows the cast and BBT is headed in that direction.  Also, the series is trending toward themes that are becoming overly personal in nature such as Howard's long lost letter from his father.  The episode where Howard and Leonard try to get more females interested in science was very lame.  The \\"Tenure\\" episode with Penny displaying maximum cleavage was very sexist and degraded her relationship with Leonard!  As of the date of this review, the season 6 BBT finale is set for 16 May 2013.  There are only a few original episodes left and CBS is re-running previous season 6 episodes in order to stretch the available episodes to the finale on 16 May.  I've downloaded several episodes from Amazon Instant Video so there were some good episodes this season.  My favorite episode was \\"The Tangible Affection Proof\\" for Valentine's Day where Penny will now have to propose to Leonard instead of vice-verse.  In closing, season 6 was a mixed bag that had some good episodes, but too many mediocre or outright bad episodes.
B00APKIN1I|3.0|tl;dr version<br />Music is good, CD is crappy.<br /><br />Saw Sound City (the movie) and Dave Grohl at SXSW and loved every minuted of it. Even inspired me to go out and buy a guitar. Enjoyed most of the tracks on the CD, but it's a total letdown. The entire basis of the movie is how digital processing made this recording studio obsolete and this movie was a way to give all that old analog audio equipment a nice last hurrah.<br /><br />What's the problem? They absolutely butchered the CD!<br /><br />EDIT (didn't realize I can't post links), so I'll tell you how to find them:<br />Google for the following 2 links:<br />Ian Shepherd's Save Sound City<br />DR database \\"Sound City\\" and compare the vinyl with the CD
B004EPZ06G|3.0|Saw this movie in the discounted movie section and thought I'd get it for a couple of dollars.<br /><br />As I expected, it was funny, but no where near the hilarity of the original.  So if you are in the mood for a decent comedy get it.  But don't expect it to be on parr with the original.<br /><br />Its funny, but just no where near close to the comedic content as the original...<br /><br />It definitely has the \\"been there done that\\" vibe to it.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|So, I downloaded this app at the airport, and it was probably not the best venue in which to test the product on my device.  However, the app worked flawlessly.  I liked the idea of being able to chat with FB connections without needing a full keyboard.  I am not a fanatical FB follower, but I think this app is great.
B006MPKDUE|4.0|The characters are real, they make you care. The stories are engaging without being contrived. Thoroughly enjoyable! There is a certain sense of inevitability, which I suppose makes this book a tragedy.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|This does a good job of quickly charging up my galaxy s3 or any other USB chargeable devices.  Haven't done any real capacity testing, but it seems to be good for at least 2 full charges from ~10%

B009LMTDL0|5.0|When I read Sheryl's book I realized I was coasting in my career.  Not moving forward at any great speed, but not going backward.  I was keeping it status quo.<br /><br />I finished the book.  I updated my résumé on the job search sites and I got a call within 8 minutes.  I'm a few days away from a huge career move!  Thank you Sheryl Sandberg for putting it all in perspective.  And for helping me respect my fellow female coworkers regardless of their career goals.  If they want to climb the corporate jungle gym, ill cup my hands and give them a boost.  If they want flexibility to work part time or flex hours, ill be banging on HR doors!<br /><br />A must read for any one who has a job, wants a job or wants to leave a job.
B006JJBFK0|5.0|This cd is very good.  It's musical sounds are breathtaking.  Awesome cd from start to finish.  Great vocals and sounds.
0316228532|4.0|Rowling has an amazing talent for bring characters to life. I could practically see their faces. This is a story of the knock on effect of one man's death and the many varied consequences. Also showing a less pleasant side to modern day England which is probably spot on. I would defiantly recommend this book, great read.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|At first the author had me confused with how the story line was laid out, but intrigued to figure out why things didn't seem right.  Once the story started to unfold I couldn't put it down.  I absolutely loved this book, and have already started recommending it to family and friends.
B008764ZQ4|5.0|Great for exercising on the treadmill. Never would have thought I would like Tom Cruise singing but do! Enjoying it.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Once I started reading, it was hard to put down.  I predicted some of the twists, but overall, the author was able to keep me wondering what would happen next.
B004W1GCQO|5.0|I like that it was free with Amazon Prime.  The video quality was great.  No problems with volume or video.
B008OOYALE|4.0|i love this game. it's a little slow, but most things are finished overnight or in a few days. Good if you have other apps that pass time more easily. buy this app! :D
B004J4WLB4|3.0|Unlikely scenario with predictable conclusion.  I did enjoy learning about the various messages particular flowers deliver and the floral business in general.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is a good show for anyone over the age of 14...drama, drama, drama, perfect for teens and adults alike.<br />I love Maggie Smith, she always brings such presence to her characters.<br />A little bit of everything to keep everyone watching and waiting for next season to air.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Great cast and story well worth the time makes me want to read the book which my wife tells me is much much better
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|It took a couple episodes to REALLY get into it, but now I am hooked. This is a fun show that shows that Noah Wiley doesn't have to play a dweeb! Though he is still a nerd in this one. I can't wait for Season 3 to come out on instant view!
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|I loved Persuasion.  It is a first rate Jane Austen novel.  As it is written in a form of older English language some sentences require a second read for full comprehension.  But all in all a very enjoyable read.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I downloaded this for my elderly parents, they enjoy it so much and its good for them.The only problem is it does start up slow.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I've heard of the game and I was interested to give it a try. Now, I'm totally hooked! It's great that the game comes with an overview and some hints that help. I'm still learning, but so far it's addicting!
1451695195|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read. Whether you believe in God or not, I definitely recommend you read this book- It changed my life, my sister's life, and my roommates life too. This book will give you a whole new perspective on the life, heaven, and reality. Don't wait any longer; it's worth the read :)
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|Recently bought a Dell Inspiron 17R. Everything is great about is except for the lack of gigabit Ethernet. I wish manufacturers would stop using fastethernet ports and make gigabit the new minimum.<br /><br />This provides a convenient solution that allows me to copy large files to and from my nas in reasonable amounts of time. I get gigabit speeds with this.<br /><br />I highly recommend it if you're in the same boat as me with USB 3.0 ports and no gigabit Ethernet.

B0057LUI0O|5.0|My kids loved this movie.  Great story,characters, and plot.  Colors and music were out of this world.  Totally worth seeing.
B005IZLPKQ|1.0|$20 for a DVD? Are you out of your mind? Blu Ray $25? So much for shopping Amazon for movies. And if it's Marvel Studios setting the price, then they can keep them. No wonder why people still bootleg movies.
B003TTCURU|5.0|excellant show....It has you excited, in tears, and laughing.  love all the couples especially mer and der.  Also Arizona and Callie.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I love this series. The method of telling the story through chronicle makes the main character a real person. The way failures and mistakes are portrayed just makes it better. Kvothe is a person, not some god-like behing despite his obvious abilities. Very well done
B00881VLCE|2.0|I have not used the Magic Puzzles in a couple of weeks. now all I get is a black screen.
1856697525|5.0|Love the book and his work. Lots of info on one of the great graphic artists of the time. Lots o f illustration but many are too small and the book would be better with fewer and large illustrations I think. So grab a magnifying glass and stop complaining. Book came under packaged and had some dings on the edges. Most things are usually over packaged and so I would prefer that to the dings.
B00009MECF|5.0|This movie really surprised me.  When it first came out, I thought... a basketball movie with Leonardo DiCaprio?  This movie is going to suck!  Many years later, I watched it for the first time and was blown away.  This movie really doesn't have much to do with basketball.  It is more of a documentary about drug addicted teens growing up in the inner city!  Really awesome movie that I would recommend to everyone!  5-stars!
B00BWJARHO|1.0|This was the absolute worst movie I have ever seen. Huge fan of the Lord of the Rings movies, but not one of those dorks that knows the 1st middle and last name of every character in the movie or anything. Just think the movies were well done.<br />This movie is an absolute Hollywood hack job. Terrible Terrible Terrible. I won't go to the theater to see movies, but for this one, I went; 3D IMAX. I have never walked out of a theater before but if I was there by myself, I would have left half way through. YES, it is THAT BAD. I hear they're making more, but unless I can find someone willing to pay me to watch them, I will never see them.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best app on my kindle. I would highly recommend buying it.<br /> It is definitely worth what I paid for it.
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|I appreciated being able to see this excellent story from the beginning.  Terrific insight into LA.  But it's really the actors I admired and got to see again.  Will order follow-up seasons..
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I really enjoyed the book all the way through, though I would have liked a chapter of Watney back on Earth. The first story I can remember about Mars was Robinson Caruso on Mars, have loved books and movies about it ever since. Marks personality was great, I was trying to think who would play him in a movie, I was pulling for him the whole way. I would read anything Andy Weir wrote, I hope he has one started already. Thanks so much for this really great book! My choice for my reading group came up after reading this book, I chose things they like, they do not read the genres I enjoy. To their credit they all agreed to read a book I read, I chose The Martian. Inwardly they all groaned, 9 women. It was a rollicking success, they loved it, admittedly skimmed over some of the science stuff, which I read every word. I reread the book though it was not too long after my first reading of it. We had a great discussion and they were genuinely surprised at how much they enjoyed it. I hope Andy Weir writes another for when my pick comes up again. Age range of my group, 50 - 80 years of age, me at 60! We are all planning a trip to see it on the big screen.

B0074VTHKM|5.0|John Grisham did it again.  A book that keeps you reading and interested all the way to the end.  I can't wait until the next one comes out.
B009NTNHJU|1.0|When I received this cd in the mail the 2nd cd didn't work so I requested a new one, when I received the second one the 2nd cd doesn't work on this one either.  I would NOT recommend anyone buying this cd set from amazon.
B008N1LL42|2.0|It had potential, but the ending was horrible. I felt that more could have also been discovered about the aliens.
B00C1BUYX4|3.0|One thing that I read showed that Lincoln was a man of character and would never have cursed as portrayed in the movie.  It's too bad we have to use today's strong language to try and portray strong moments in this film.  The movie was compelling, although it seemed to move a bit slow.  Lots of dialogue, but that was expected.

B005USZML4|5.0|I heard this book in our 2/3 grade classroom.  The kids loved it and as an adult, I did too.  It's nice to find a book that all ages can enjoy.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|Sheryl Sandberg has some good ideas that women need to hear. Her thoughts are clear and relatable. Women who are about to start their careers will find this informative.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|I was really looking forward to this movie, and was sorely disappointed. I'm rather surprised by the rave reviews, considering how narrow the target audience must be. If you are a major history buff and/or can be enthralled by 2-1/2 hours of folks in period costume talking about and around every aspect of politics of their day using period-accurate dialogue, this is the movie for you. Otherwise, be prepared to ingest a triple-dose of your favorite caffeinated beverage before pushing 'play'; I had every intention of seeing it through to the end but my eyelids gave up about halfway through the film.<br />Pros:<br />Accuracy<br />Attention to the historical figures<br />Intricacies you'd probably miss in a standard history book<br />Cons:<br />Visually dark; I was straining my eyes to see movement on-screen<br />Fast-paced dialogue made it easy to miss the redeeming bits of humor<br />Can't comment as to the second half, but you'll spend the first half wishing someone would stop talking and just DO something
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|I love this CD.  This is Bowie at his best.  I enjoyed every song and I listen to it all the time.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|Another great escape from Nicolas Sparks. I couldn't wait to get off work and read the next chapter! Josh Duhamel was believable (sans grey hair) in the movie as single dad Alex.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Good book.  It portrays a very sad set of events in a family.  I recommend the book.  I always enjoy a book that keeps me reading.
B000TDGGRY|4.0|This is not one of James Rollins better books. I love to read Rollins and was looking forward to this book. It just wasn't there for me. The main plot about the Judas Strain was very confusing. It started back in the time of Marco Polo and brought into the present. To me it never was made very clear exactly what the Judas Strain was. You may enjoy the book more than me but I was a little let down.
B008Y73XTQ|5.0|it seems to give a very accurate story of life on a submarine.  this is from the German point of view but i suspect all sub life was very similar back in WW2

B0010358D0|5.0|Was different more up to date anime then the first still loads of action and a must see blows the first movie out of the water was one of the best anime purchases I have ever boughten.
B0027MJU00|3.0|I gave this 3  stars because I didn't think the story wrapped up, it just kind of ended.  Good story, not as good as Sharp Objects or Gone Girl.
B003IY48PS|4.0|I loved this movie! It's THE classic B movie Horror! Watch with friends and you'll have a good night! Have Fun!
B00B7VPKMY|3.0|I just have to echo what others are saying about The Long Run in hopes that someone from Rhino is paying attention and will correct the problem and to warn others. The Long Run is inferior sound quality (not the remastered version). The other 5 discs are fine. This must have been a screw up by warners/rhino, because it just doesn't make sense that they would do this on purpose. A real shame. I had to go buy a separate remastered version on the Long Run. I certainly shouldn't have had to do that, but there is a big difference between the sound quality and volume. If you are planning on playing these discs together or creating mixes on an ipod, it will be maddening when the Long Run tunes kick in!
B00168OIP8|5.0|This was a great movie when it was made, and seeing it again was twice as fun. Would recommend it to others.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I couldnt put it down.  Always wanted to see what was going to happen next.  Travis is so moody but you cant help but love him, and Abby(pidge) open your eyes girl!
B000067FP7|5.0|Movie was a great buy so much better then watching it on VHS so much clearer and it brings back the good old movie watching experience.
B001EBWIRW|5.0|This play has always been borderline cult. This rendition brings great actors together in one place. There is a lot of tongue in check references for the time. It is a classic!
B002HR1W1K|5.0|A satirical take on the action buddy cop genre seen through the British eye's of Simon Pegg. One of the funniest movies to come out of the UK in years.
B0093ST02E|2.0|The movie was slow and did not even keep my attention for more then 30 minutes, and then I fell asleep. I was surprised that it wasn't any better than that!
B003UESJHO|5.0|This was a great movie when it was made, and seeing it again was twice as fun. Would recommend it to others.

B00499QUK2|5.0|It was a great who-done-it. Typical Sherlock home fashion with the modern clues and technology. It is very entertaining! It played while I worked.
B005FUTBV4|5.0|This is a very unconditional Kevin Smith movie. Every time you think you know what's coming the movie does the exact opposite. If you're looking for a Clerks/Mallrats experience keep looking, if you're looking for something that will leave you with questions this is your movie.
B00BWJ7LYG|3.0|this is not a great follow up to the greatest movie trilogy ever. i hope the next movie or 2 are better and less unrealistic and corny
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I love this English TV show that focuses on the lives of many inhabitants of 2 small towns side by side in the Victorian era.  The characters are lively, loveable and their stories are heart warming, family centered and honest.  So many refreshing universal truths are emphasized in each episode. The writing is delightful!  I'm sure this was a huge hit in Europe.
B00BHU9BV6|3.0|Just didn't really get this movie. I think it was too artistic for the storyline, but man, was it beautiful and fun to look at.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|The movie was very entertaining and a fun watch for the entire family.  The quality of the streaming was also very good!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This journey started with a friend to give us something to talk about. It quickly turned into a must watch. Caution this will be a must watch all at once!

0007347448|5.0|Jane Austen's masterpiece, Pride and Prejudice, is an epic novel, and no review or praise of this book, including mine, will yield it justice or measure the genius of the author behind it. There have been countless reviews of Jane Austen's writing style and epic novels. What else can I say that has not been said already? Perhaps if we as human beings are as complex and unique as Austen's characters, so is the imprint of her book on our hearts and souls, and so here is my imprint.Jane Austen portrays characters that have clearly withstood the test of time, and through them, she shows us her powerful understanding of the complexities of the human emotions. Perhaps even as our world has changed dramatically since Austen's time, we are still able to identify and relate to these complexities. Perhaps, human beings in their essence do not change all that much even as their environment evolves and improves by gross dimensions.<br /><br />The recurring themes in Pride and Prejudice, so carefully depicted by Austen, transport you ever so delicately into the world of 1813. These themes, the need for validation and identity for men and women alike, the obsession with honorable deeds and actions, the preservation of characters by their integrity, weaved perfectly through the author's flawless prose, create some of the best writing of our time. Austen was a gifted writer and we are lucky to have her timeless prose to cherish long after her time. In Pride and Prejudice, she articulates all range of human emotions in the most exquisite language and in such layers and authenticity, that you are powerless and inspired in its presence at the same time.<br />Austen exercises a commendable balance of players, lest we forget what lovely creatures in print our Elizabeth Bennet and Jane Bennet make. It is nauseating to tolerate the insufferable characters: Mrs. Bennet, Lydia, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, Miss Bingley, and the infamous Mr. Wickham. Yet it is a small price to pay to take a seat and listen to the symphony of dialogs between \\"Lizzy\\" and Mr. Darcy.<br /><br />The enormous patience, compassion and forgiveness of Ms. Jane Bennet, the older sister of Lizzy, is a thing to awe. The patience to withhold any display of emotion, anger, sadness, frustration, loneliness, depression, even in the face of dishonesty, betrayal and poor judgment. Jane has her reasons, and Lizzy argues with them. Lizzy is outspoken and courageous, and yet, even her bravery has to be moderated in a society that values above all things the appearances, manners and social class. Opposites in this regard they may be, Lizzy and Jane can only confide and be most intimate with one another as the drama of their lives unfolds before them.<br /><br />The vivacious heroine of our story is Elizabeth Bennet, or Lizzy. In Austen's words, Elizabeth is \\"as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print\\", and alas, I have to agree. Elizabeth is a woman born years before her time for her intellect, perception and judgment. With all odds against her, you cannot help but be in awe of her for finding the delicate balance between defying all who place boundaries on her dreams and politely playing by all the rules.<br /><br />She is magnificent with her tongue. The English language bows before her, and she makes words dance, sing, and perform remarkably well on the stage of her speeches. She can bring Mr. Darcy to his knees and send him off with a rage and fury all in the course of one conversation. She is neither ashamed nor proud of her average connections and social class. Nevertheless, she refuses to believe that her ties stand in the way of her chances of connecting with higher classes of society. She values genuine character above all else, and holds herself to the same standard. It is this trait of character that causes her much pain when she realizes how unjustly she had treated Mr. Darcy in his first proposal of marriage. Her indignation of his conduct, after careful study, seemed harsh and unjust. Upon realization of her poor behavior, Elizabeth's vexation towards him turns into compassion and she chides herself. \\"Til this moment\\", she says, \\"I never knew myself.\\"<br /><br />Pride and Prejudice teaches us to not judge so quickly the mere actions of those we hold dear in our hearts, those we respect and cherish. It teaches us not to close doors before we thoroughly examine the situation, the motives, the intent beyond what may seem as bitter actions. It teaches us to not listen only for things we want to hear, for this quick judgment can be so potent that it can deafen us from any argument that may oppose it. Elizabeth regrets deeply the prejudice she exercised for the mistaken pride of Mr. Darcy. We cannot help but feel her regret and her pain.<br /><br />Pride and Prejudice teaches us to not judge so quickly the mere actions of those we hold dear in our hearts, those we respect and cherish.

B007R21JJK|4.0|Had this motherboard sense November of 2012 and using it in my home theater gaming PC. Did have a couple of issues after installing it. 1: The optical audio tends to go out of sync as time goes on. This problem was fixed by installing a dedicated sound card (SB1350). 2: The front USB 3.0 port connection is unreliable and disconnecting quite often (Case Cooler Master HAF 922). However the on board USB ports are reliable and just use a USB hub connecting my mouse and keyboard.<br /><br />Other than those two issue, everything else about this motherboard works well. I know this isn't much of a review, just pointing out little issues I have but nothing that a deal breaker and couldn't be worked around.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|This book is well written and tells an amazing story that reminds me of the movie Castaway. There are points that I wish the book would have went a little faster but over all a good book. It will leave you asking yourself the question of what would I do in the same situation.

B007PFD90G|2.0|I thought that this was going to never end. It is a boring read and dragged on and on. It also never came together for me. It was really more like one long diatrab of his prior book and how it was received in the global marketplace???

B000YIGNKE|4.0|I liked this version better than the 1995 version.  I watched this one soon after watching the other version and noticed immediately that this one has a more serious feel to it.  Through the camera work, lighting, music, and probably through the way the actors set their moods also, the director emphasized that Anne missing her chance at being happy was serious; that it had dominated her life for years and that it always would.  The movie communicated her overwhelming sadness very well.  In one early scene showing Anne writing a letter where we hear the narration of it, for example, she looks directly at the camera for several seconds so as to say, \\"so you see what this is like and what it has meant to me?  You understand?\\"  The movie forces you to realize how heartbreaking it would be for Anne to have missed her chance and to have never forgotten the guy, and to see how long that feeling had gone on.  This work early on sets up the viewer to sense the joy of what happened later more fully.<br />And I liked the scene at the end with her running through the streets.  Not realizing that it wasn't in the book, since I haven't read it, I was free to enjoy it.  The scene says that she knew absolutely what she wanted now and wasn't going to be persuaded differently again, and that she was now willing to break any and all rules of propriety for the sake of grabbing hold of love.  She wasn't going to miss it again for anything.  Also, as a male I can say that I'd be much more likely to be crazy about this Anne than the other one.
030758836X|1.0|I am an avid reader and finally downloaded this book on my kindle.  What a HUGE disappointment!  I have never written a review for any book, but feel compelled to now.  The flow of this book is like a riding a bad roller coaster. Past, present, diary, past and back to present day.  This made the character development weak for me and I could not feel anything for this couple.  Other characters were brought in (the Dad) but added nothing to this story line.  The last few chapters are rushed.  I didn't even know if what I was reading was \\"real\\" at this point.  The ending left me looking for another chapter, angry and feeling duped by this author.  If you like soap operas with ludicrous story lines then this book is for you.
B000HZD168|5.0|I'm a loyal fan but not a true Trekkie. The original cast I still think was the best; even while they visibly aged on-screen. But Wrath of Khan was more grippingly excellent than all the others. The sequel to this one was more fun...but this one had me riveted and I still enjoy re-viewing it today.

B003LQ3YXU|5.0|If you are a Dr. Who fan and haven't seen this first season you've missed out.  You are introduced to some of the original enemies from the 60's, get a clue about the history of the Time Lords, and you find out about Captain Jack Harkness (why he is immortal).  You also see the growth of Rose from not having a direction or purpose in her life to learning about what is important through her travels with the Doctor. In season two you see her become a grown, mature woman.
0142419400|5.0|I am not sure what urged me to get this book, but I am beyond glad I did. This quickly became my favorite contemporary ever and Stephanie Perkins made my list of top ten auto buy authors. To say the least, I was enamored with every single thing about this book.<br /><br />Anna is being shipped off to Paris at the request of her absentee father. When she arrives, she is thrust into a group of tight-knit friends, which includes Étienne St. Clair, a gorgeous American boy with a British accent with a French family. But he comes with a catch...a long-term girlfriend. Anna and Étienne find themselves bonding like they never have before. But they have a couple obstacles in their way. Can they finally get on the same page and have their forever-anticipated French kiss?<br /><br />Anna was such an amazing protagonist. She was quirky and funny, a great and loyal friend. She was very pretty and had a very cool bleached strip in her hair I only wish I could pull off. I loved her inner monologue. I could relate to her so easily. She went through many things I have or people I know have, and I just loved the reality of Anna and her situations.<br /><br />Étienne is...wow, total perfection. He is British. (I have a very well established thing for British men) He is gorgeous. He is friendly and charming. But he's also really short and deathly afraid of heights. But all his seeming flaws make him absolutely wonderful. I fell for Étienne so very fast, just like Anna. It's pretty impossible not to. You'll see. :)<br /><br />I loved their motely crew of friends. Meredith was a sweet friend who has harbored a crush on St. Clair, but she was completely understanding of Anna. I liked Josh and Rashmi by themselves, but as a couple, they clearly didn't work out. Well, of course, since Josh is the love interest in Isla and the Happily Ever After, which I can't wait for!<br /><br />The writing was so relatable. Being inside Anna's head was hilarious. The plot was sweet, and it captivatedmy interests until the end of the book. It wasn't action packed or anything, but that didn't matter at all. The setting was beautiful. Paris, and all of its' landmarks, were portrayed so vividly I felt as if I was there. Of course, the romance is the best part of this book. They start out as really close friends. Their friendship was invaluable to them, and it's true when people say they fall in love with their best friends. They had a knack for understanding the other person inexplicably. I loved their banter and every encounter they had. They also have some very swoon-worthy moments, mixed in with some really adorable moments.<br /><br />Luckily, readers see more Anna and Étienne in Lola and the Boy Next Door, which is an equally endearing story. I highly suggest this totally sweet and light series by a delightful author.<br /><br />Favorite Swoon-worthy Quote: We are kissing like crazy. Like our lives depend on it. His tongue slips inside my mouth, gentle but demanding, and it's nothing like I've ever experienced, and I suddenly understand why people describe kissing as melting because every square inch of my body dissolves into his. My fingers grip his hair, pulling him closer. My veins throb and my heart explodes. I have never wanted anyone like this before. Ever.<br /><br />Rating: 5/5 Tar Heels!

B000AMJC2K|5.0|We were looking for a mount that would handle a large computer screen, be completly adjustable, simple to install and set up. After looking at several mounts I ordered two of the Neo-Flex. They were everthing that we wanted and more! We set the first one up in about 20 minutes. I spent most of this time reading the instructions. The second one didn't take five minutes. The mount comes with two desk mounting options and two screen mount plates, no drilling required. We had HP monitors and they fit perfectly. The mount looks a little spindly in the picture. I assure you that is not the case. Once it is set up and locked in place it is solid. It can also be left to swivel so you can turn it to show a guest or an employee a graph or a proposal. If you are lloking for a good looking, functional screenmount this is it.
B00C1BUYX4|2.0|If you will pardon my view of Mr. Spielberg's Presidential overview of the passing of the 13th Amendment, and as righteous as that piece of legislation grew up to be, to me, that is, this prodction was an absolute bore...  I know I ill be Politically Incorrect; although, PC has nothing to do with my view of this feature. It was just slow and old - much like I'm growin' to be with all these films I have been renting off of Amazon.

1250007208|4.0|I was so very hesitant to read this book, and for the life of me, I could not tell you why. I was not sure of the whole premise of the book, and clearly, I was super super wrong for not reading it sooner!<br /><br />Cinder is a mechanic and a cyborg living in New Beijing. She has no idea of her past, and she only remembers up to a couple years ago. When she meets Prince Kai, she is thrust into a world that is much too unknown to her, and she realizes everything she has been told about herself is a lie. She finds out that there is an evil queen, the queen of the Lunars, threatening everyones very existence. With everything on the line, she needs to decide what side she is on and what she is willing to do for her side to prevail.<br /><br />Cinder was a completely great heroine. Despite being a second-class citizen, she is content where she is, even though her stepmom is a social climber. She just wishes for some love, and I wished for that for her. This girl just needed some hugs. She doesn't care about material things and only looks on the inside to judge a person. Although she may be many different things, she knows who she is on the inside, and that's really what's most important. Plus, she has a great sense of humor.<br /><br />Kai was just too freakin' adorable for words. He's super sweet and very swoon-worthy. Perhaps my favorite thing about him was treatment to Cinder. He was always courteous to her and more importantly, he was just himself to her. He didn't have the façade of being a prince around her; he was just Kai. His determination to run a country, especially at his age, was admirable. He was thrust into the position, but he really did excellently. He did have his flaws, particularly at the end, but I still love the man.<br /><br />Iko, Cinder's android, was possibly my favorite character. She was quite lovely and a great friend to Cinder. Of course, I absolutely hated the stepmom. Ugh ugh ugh. I mean, this is a retelling of Cinderella after all. Peony, one of the stepsisters is not really all that bad, and I grew to really like her. Dr. Erland was someone I was prepared to loathe, but I'm not sure why. Surprisingly, he was rather awesome, particularly at the end.<br /><br />The plot was perfect. Despite the fact that this is a retelling of a very well known fairy tale, I was pleasantly surprised by how original it is. Meyer certainly threw me for a loop many a time, and I enjoyed every second of it. The writing was beautiful and enchanting. It was what sucked me in right from the first page. Now for the romance. I loved how they met. \\"Hey mechanic, can you fix my android?\\" *too stunned for words* \\"Sssss-sure Prince Kai.\\" Not a super typical way to meet. Kai's persistence to ask Cinder out was hilarious and charming, and I am sure surprised she didn't give in sooner than she did. Basically, I want more of Cinder and Kai in Scarlet.<br /><br />The way Cinder ended....gahhhhhh. So mean! I am super excited to read Scarlet, as I know I'll love Scarlet just as I do Cinder.<br /><br />Favorite Swoon-worthy Quote: Without hesitating, Cinder wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him. Kai froze, his body as tense as an android's against her, but his lips were soft and warm. Though Cinder had intended for it to be a short kiss, she found herself lingering. Hot tingles coursed through her body, surprising and scary but not unpleasant, surging like electricity through her wires.<br /><br />Rating: 4/5 Tar Heels!
B005HEK3JW|5.0|I love anything to do with Star Trek.  I am so glad to be able to receive it on my IPad! Commander Riker is the bomb?

0443069522|5.0|A great book for anyone interested in anatomy at any level. The best anatomy book I have ever read, no doubt.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|Great comedy. My husband and I watched the movie and loved it. The story line was light to follow. The acting was engaging, the music was phenomenal. I did really love the humor and bonding of these two main characters of the movie. There is no such a thing as racism as some critic pointed out. Being employed by a rich man is not racist. On the contrary, that is how the world works. Highly suggested the movie, not only for the acting, but the music as well.
B002NXSRW0|5.0|All of us really enjoyed this action packed movie! Got such a fantastic price on this. Planning to watch again for family movie night.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|Pitch perfect! Every song from the movie. Loved ever minute of it! It is definitely on my list to refer to my friends!
B001E45XT4|3.0|Headset was good for about 6-8 months until the mic went out. Only a few drops here and there. The padding is soft, but prone to absorbing your face oil, so it needs to be cleaned. However, ten months in, when I was pulling off the ear padding, the whole speaker came off. It wasn't a very hard pull or anything.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a very addicting and fun game. It's like temple run but with a different story and creativity to it. That's pert of the reason it's so much fun to play.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Mortal Instruments - City of Bones was a very good book. Easy to read, and very enjoyable. It moves really quick, so you don't even notice you reached the end of the book. I'm craving some more, so I'm definitely buying the next book in the series.
0061978078|5.0|OH.MY.GOD.<br /><br />I have waited too long to read this book! I loved, loved, loved Delirium when I read it, finishing it in only a few days, and this sequel was no exception. Because most series tend to go downhill from book one, I was pleasantly surprised with Pandemonium, but then again, I've loved all of Lauren Oliver's work thus far, so I should never have doubted her.<br /><br />I'm trying to review this without spoiling either book, which is extremely hard because so much is changed here. Change of setting, cast of characters, plot. Now that Lena's learning more about herself as well as revealing dark secrets about her past, she's still the awesome, fighting,  bad-ass girl I was rooting for in book one . . . Even more so in this one.<br /><br />The love issue was even creepier than before. I remember reading Delirium and easily imagining how our world could turn into that one. It's always scary when such an awful society could actually come to exist, if we developed the technology needed to take the ability to love away. I feel horrible just thinking about it . . . And whenever stories or references to dissenters and those in love pop up in these books, I get incredibly happy and root for all of those who are ready to rebel.<br /><br />I'm definitely going to continue with this series! . . . I wish I had the next book now. I need to go look up when it's actually scheduled for release, but I'm afraid to see how many months or years I'll have to wait. I need more. Until then, I'll keep raving about this book to my friends and trying to convince everyone to read it.<br /><br />So, you there. Yeah, you. You should start this series, if you haven't already, or read this sequel. GO.<br /><br />ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE. 5/5 stars

0486278077|4.0|I had to read this as part of my school's summer reading. The Picture of Dorian Gray tells the story of a young man who seemingly has everything-wealth, good looks-and throws away his good reputation for the chance to stay forever young and beautiful. As the book progresses, the painting that grows older becomes a sort of conscience for Dorian.<br /><br />This book is very dark and the ending is very surprising and twisted. But I actually liked it. It was deep in an absurd sort of way, that makes the reader think about why they shouldn't behave as the characters are.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this, whether you're trying to get through the classics or just looking for a novel to enjoy. Though this was published in 1890, there are some themes that are still obvious in the modern world.
B000W93CHC|5.0|I read Follet's espionage writings as a college student and I loved him then. Didn't know he was this good though, EXCELLENT book
B0044C5SCU|5.0|This show has all my favorite things. The science stretches into the unknown without being cheesy. The characters are both likeable and consistent (I hate it when a character suddenly changes his or her basic motives for the sake of a story). Each episode immediately makes me want to see the next, and streaming it is great without any commercials and no waiting for the next episode. It is what Lost started as before it jumped the shark. So far, into the fourth season and still worth watching.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|MIDNIGHT IN PARIS is a wonderful film full of humor and beautiful directing by an american master. The first two minutes of the film are a series of shots of Paris with a Sidney Bichet song playing in the background. It reminded me of how much I love Paris and Allen is clearly paying homage to this wonderful city. Owen Wilson is great as the hopeless romantic who has visions of Paris in 1920's. He loves Paris in the rain and he clearly is not on the same page as his girlfriend who does not understand his obsession with the city. I relate to this because my wife and I have the same relationship dynamic. I am the passionate one who finds joy in every aspect of life. She is less enthusiastic about lifes little pleasures.
B00BXRFCFM|5.0|been a fan of this band since they first hit the scene and it's really amazing to see/hear them Mature and this NEW SOUND WORKS FOR THEM !!!!! And their Playing Warped this year (2013) \m/ BUY THIS ALBUM
B00BIPCY14|5.0|Interesting personal drama - family, courtroom, through the looking glass law firm &#34;politics&#34;, all mixed with both an overtone / undertone of sexual tension.
0307946711|5.0|OH. MY.<br /><br />I loved this book so much! With the simplistic writing style, fantastic characterization, and gripping plotline, One Day is at times charming and devastating. It had me laughing at the absurd, lovely moments between Dexter and Emma, or either of them and the other characters that populated the novel. It had me frustrated with their quirks and how it kept them apart, had me realizing just how precious time really is. Because although twenty years seems like an extremely long time, this book shows that it can go by quickly.<br /><br />What I particularly liked about Dexter and Em was that they weren't sweetened into farces of people, instead of being shown as the unique ones they could be; filled with weird traits and ideas that made them different from everyone else, and made the two of them seem more real. In fact, nearly all of the characters in One Day are like this.<br /><br />The tone of the novel, which paints everything with a humorous edge and manages to make even the worst of situations have a bright, comical side, was brilliant. Without it, this wouldn't be the book it is, and would have stayed much more depressing while dragging on and on. Instead, I flew through the pages, wanting to know what each year brought the two, whether they were first meeting, together, apart, across the world from each other . . . It was hard to keep myself away.<br /><br />One Day is a heart-wrenching, gut-busting must read for those who like romances that aren't mushy, stories of love and friendship, tales of growing up and finding yourself, or something that has all of the above. This will definitely be one of my all-time favorites, and I'll be recommending it to everyone.<br /><br />STRIKING. 5/5 stars
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I liked this second book in the series even more than the first one.  There are at lot of main characters but they seem to be more endearing than in the first book.  It is interesting to have a saga come together.  It is a bit like a good TV series but the ideas behind socialism, capitalism and communism are mixed and debated in more depth by the reading.  Lots of twists and turns even though one knows historical facts.  A fun read.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Great characters engaging in the simple forms of everyday living. I love the Irish dialog and humor.  Fast paced, but full of tender emotion.
B0070YDOT8|5.0|its a fun and exciting game. just like bieng at the casino, without having to pay the money to pay to go to the casino.
B001EBROWQ|5.0|This is one of those movies that is a tradition in our family.  Though we are not overly religious, the story presented here is more about the bible and all the lessons that Jesus and other characters from the book have given us.  It is beautifully made and though a bit slow moving, it is a must see.
B003G8Y4QO|4.0|Each season gets better and better...there should be 10 stars!  Some minor improvement in production quality but definitely better and better story lines.
B007SRZULW|4.0|I've been meaning to read this book for years and when I finally went and bought myself a copy I knew I'd have to buckle down and get to it. Sometimes trudging through the sentence structures and word usage of a book like this can intimidate a person enough to make them put it down immediately. But I suppose if school's been good for anything it's taught me at least that things as daunting as this can get better as time goes on. So I persisted, and so I loved it. And came to love the wonderful, quirky word choices as well.<br /><br />The first part of the book as well as the last went by in gigantic chunks taken all at once for me. I was incredibly interested by the introduction of the characters, as I immediately found most of them hilarious. From Mr. Bennet, laughing at the expense of his own family, to Mrs. Bennet, outrageously silly and ignorant, to all of the sisters and their exaggerated personalities, to Mr. Darcy himself. I didn't know much about the entire novel, or the premise, or how it was supposed to end . . . Only that for some reason many people are obsessed with this Darcy fellow. As a result, I spent the majority of my time wondering what on earth everyone and their mother saw in him that was so wonderful. Then I finished the novel, and well, okay, I might love him a little bit, now.<br /><br />The middle was the hardest to pull through, consisting of a lot of nothing. I knew some of it was important, though the rest seemed just like a dull waste of time. Until some sentence or other would pull me back in again. I still can't get over reading about someone staying over at someone's house for only 10 days and how `short a stay it would be'! Um. Ten days is not very short. I understand carriage rides aren't exactly the same as driving along in nice comfortable cars, but that doesn't mean I want all of my relatives to come live with me for months on end.<br /><br />I can see why this book has been recommended to me by friends, teachers, and enemies. (Alright, maybe that was a lie, but I'm assuming they'd like it, too.) Yes, I did like the entire romance aspect of it. (What girl can resist that? Seriously? Seriously.) I could perfectly picture all of the settings, and the strict social rules as well as the ideals of each social class.<br /><br />This book made me laugh so much! The little insights on everything were delightful. Many of them were still relevent to today, and I could easily see connections to people like Elizabeth and Darcy to those living now. One of my favorite quotes from the book has to be, \\"As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits; or, in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more.\\" Okay, so who doesn't do that? I know that I do, and most of the people I know do this as well. See? Still relevent! And people say they can get nothing out of classic literature. By `people, I here mean my fellow classmates.<br /><br />If you've been tentatively considering reading this, or been intimidated by it, give it a go! You might just enjoy it as much as I did.

B009GXHOW4|2.0|My friend has always wanted this on his IPOD. But sadly you guys wont put PocketInvEvditor&reg; on apple devices. I will give it a 5 star rating once you put it on apple. I actually think this app is really helpful for MCPE. You did a great job. I reccommend this for anyone who loves and wants to impress their friends on Minecraft&reg;.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I liked this book.  It's not rocket science - but it is an enjoyable, fast read.  The main character is delightful and the subordinate characters and fun, irritating and real.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Fantastic that Child has taken his readers back to the beginning in term's of what prompted Reacher to go walkabout in the first place.  I loved the plot and the twists in this story which is centered around the deception of politicians, military leaders, murders near a military base and a local law enforcement officer.  Jack gets the lady as the title suggests, and the seed for Jack's life beyond the MPs is planted.
B004SDSSFY|4.0|IT performs as advertised. For this devise 's limitations it provides theFun to play with. necessary function well enough.<br />Thanks
1451696191|5.0|I've been meaning to read this book for a while, and since banned books week was this past week, I decided it was as good a time as ever to pick it up. I'm so glad I did-and happened to spot it on display at the library-because this is really a novel that gives you something to think about. Although it might contain some things people deem offensive, or talk about things not often mentioned it literature, The Perks of Being a Wallflower is definitely a great read.<br /><br />Charlie is a shy and awkward person, and he's had to deal with some horrible things in his life. And he's trying to get his life together, though he doesn't know exactly how to do that. I know everyone feels that on some level, they don't fit in with everyone else, but with him it's more evident than it usually is. With a leading character like this, the other characters managed to shine, too: Sam, Patrick, even Bill and Brad.<br /><br />Some parts of the book made me laugh aloud. Others left me shocked, and still more made me want to cry. This novel was a roller coaster of emotions, and I loved all of it. Even the points where I was tempted to put it down, because I was afraid of where it would go on from there. And yet, I'm so glad I kept with it, because this is a novel that will be sticking with me for a while.<br /><br />I know that The Perks of being a Wallflower is being made into a movie, set to be released in 2012. I can't wait to see that! After reading the book and falling in love with it, and knowing the cast has my favorite actor, Logan Lerman, staring as Charlie, and actress, Emma Watson, as Sam, has definitely raised my expectations. Here's hoping it's worth seeing!<br /><br />I give this book 5/5 stars. Don't be turned away by the controversy it's caused. Read it, and decide for yourself. I hope you'll find out you liked it as much as I did.
0062238868|5.0|This is an in-depth look at SEAL training and deployment in the Iran/Afghan territories.  Nothing boastful about his success which is historic.  I loved it.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Having been a history major in college, I found the details of WW I, very interesting but for those who don't, I believe they would have to skim throughout the book.  Very detailed in the history dept. but I found it a great read & am looking forward to the next two.
B004LROUNG|4.0|John Grisham has a talent for keeping the reader engaged even when the outcome is patently obvious.  A great holiday read
B007GCY8FS|4.0|It seem's Lee Child has decided to continue the Reacher blast through the Mid-West winter and follow on from the previous two novels (61 Hours and Worth Dying For). What a week Jack is having!  The body count is mounting and all Jack is trying to do is get to Virginia to meet a lady.  Some interesting twists in this one.  I remain a keen Jack fan.
B00933JF74|5.0|Love this little game.  The Premium version doesn't ask for any money (in-app purchasing thing).  You can really lose time with this one, but it's fun.  There are scenarios, and there are also unlimited scenarios where you can play indefinitely.
014241493X|5.0|I've waited far too long to read one of John Green's novels. I've heard nothing but praise for them, but never had the urge to pick one up before now. Thankfully, my local library had a copy of Paper Towns, which I snatched half on a whim, half to find out whether or not it would click with me.<br /><br />I can't put my finger on what exactly made me like this book. The characters were brilliant, and exactly like teenagers-fickle and filled with flaws, but not necessarily bad because of this. And I think so many young adult books dumb it down or add large words that just don't mix with modern speech. The twisting plot, attitude problems, and relationship drama reminds me of myself and my friends. It's always great when you can relate to what you read.<br /><br />I like the little quirks Quentin & Co. are given. Margo is a mystery in and of herself, adding plenty of suspense and intrigue. Though I definitely liked the story from the start, the plot picked up near the end and I ended up blowing off a night of homework just to get to the end. ^^ So, be warned. Whatever you were doing before you started this...Prepare to procrastinate with Paper Towns.<br /><br />Paper Towns is a great novel that I give 4.5/5 stars. I recommend it to any mystery, young adult, or John Green fans. Plus, any nerdfighters out there. I've been one for...half a year now, I think. Have no idea what I'm talking about?

B004JZBGWI|5.0|Like that you can color code things and make lists to check items off. that is all I have to say aobut that
0385349947|5.0|Love, love, love this book. I have learned so much from it. I plan on getting it for all my girlfriends as well!
B00C7JFIRC|5.0|This is the first review I've chosen to do, despite many other films I have had the chance to write about. That alone should tell you how much this movie meant to me.<br /><br />I saw the movie in theaters today. It was fantastic through and through. The first thing I'll mention that everyone is probably already aware of are the jaw-dropping visuals. The trailers and previews don't do it justice. You must see it to believe it. I don't believe I have ever seen such eye-poppingly beautiful scenery and digital artwork in a film. If I have, it has been a very very long time. For those reading this while the movie is still in theaters, I highly recommend seeing it in IMAX. The vivid colors, Oz's immense landscape, and the tag-along camera work grabs you by the hand and pulls you into Oz with breakneck speed just like the tornado that whisked Dorothy away! You will be immersed in such thrilling beauty it will literally make your eyes widen. A great, and I mean a really GREAT deal of money sweat and hard work were put into this movie's visuals alone. I honestly wonder how well Blu Ray will be able to capture the level of beauty and detail that this film produces.<br /><br />It takes a lot of talent to take an internationally iconic story like The Wizard of Oz and give it a gigantic and immersive backstory that is simple to follow and yet colorfully written with enough modern innovation and refinement to make the movie grippingly entertaining from start to finish. There was never once a dull moment in the movie. James Franco is a great young Oz, full of charisma. Mischievous, sly, but with a heart full of gold in the end. Can you really expect anything less from the Wizard himself? The relationships between all of the characters are very heartfelt. I'm not a soft or serious moviegoer usually, but I must say, my heartstrings were plucked many a time throughout this story. It is a story of self discovery, of finding a place to belong. A story of compassion, love, empathy, andvision.<br /><br />::IMPORTANT::<br /><br />There are probably some of you who are undoubtedly concerned that this movie is unfaithful to the spirit and tradition of the original Oz film.  Fear not. There is plenty of homage paid to the original movie both thematically and story-wise. You will immediately spot the references to the original and will be thrilled with how they were incorporated into this movie. All the innovations made to this Oz are within reasonable boundaries of the original creative spirit and will not detract from making Oz The Great And Powerful from being one of the best family movies you have ever seen in your life!
B009NPK1IO|5.0|Great series, very well done, great production.<br />Hopefully we can get something similar soon, lots of glamour, fashion and love.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I love oz! I saw the movie and it was so cool! If I could I wold give this game a 10 star rating!
B00B5P37IG|1.0|I have a Kindle Fire HD and not a single channel would play or even open on my device. I want a refund but mot sure how to get one.
B00AB0Z88S|3.0|I will start by saying I did not read this book, so I watched this movie with a clean slate and no sentimental history with the story.<br /><br />I found this movie to be decent, but I would never willingly sit through a second viewing of it. The special effects were impressive, and cinematography was beautiful.<br /><br />However, I was not a big fan of the story nor the plot. Also, the movie was a bit too long to keep my interest. Nevertheless, I was entertained for most of the movie. There is good humor sprinkled throughout, and production quality was excellent. Families with children may enjoy this movie given the settings, abundance of animals in the movie, and an all in all uncontroversial story.<br /><br />I would not recommend this movie to most of my friends, and I certainly would not recommend them to buy it. Unless you have read the book and love the story, I would recommend this as more of a rental if you are set on watching it, and not so much as one to keep in your library.
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|DJango Unchained is pure Tarantino served up fresh, innovative and with his signature, obscure humor shinning through the over the top violence. I love Quinten Tarrantino movies for all of the above and then some.<br /><br />How many other directors have changed the face of movie making? How many have created and defined a new genre of film that transcended above and beyond their signature style? Before Tarantino movies weren't told out of sequence, sequence was everything - story board to film. The reasons for this are obvious but Tarantino broke new ground with \\"Reservoir Dogs\\" proved lightening can indeed strike twice with \\"Pulp Fiction' And cast his style forever in stone with both \\"Kill Bill\\" and \\"Kill Bill 2\\" - Django Unchained takes the great shame of slavery as a background much in the way \\"Inglorious Basterds\\" used the horror of the Nazi Holocaust.<br /><br />To not see the humor in Tarantino movies is to miss the point, in a recent interview with the late and extraordinary film critic Roger Ebert Mr. Tarantino said \\"  To me, the most torturous thing in the world, and this counts for 'Reservoir Dogs' just as much as it does to 'Pulp,' is to watch it with an audience who doesn't know they're supposed to laugh. Because that's a death. Because I'm hearing the laughs in my mind, and there's this dead silence of crickets sounding in the audience, you know?\\"<br /><br />I think Tarantino fans do know , at least I would like to think so.<br /><br />Django offers up a compelling story against an equally compelling background it is a brilliant film. There have been major complaints about the frequent use of the \\"N-Word\\" but this is part and parcel of how life was during these times and the use of that word is appropriate and real.<br /><br />I cringe when I read that classic fiction like Tom Sawyer have been re-written to remove such words. It's beyond censorship because no one people have an exclusive when it comes to human suffering - and we can't sugar coat the reality of the horrors of the past by removing verbage that is today, offensive. In doing so we rob future generations of the lessons learned from the countless lives lost in the struggle for human rights and their remaining legacy to teach them.<br /><br />Django Unchained is one hell of a ride.ality of the horrors of the past by removing verbage that is today, offensive.

B0042TV4IW|4.0|I had heard this was a good show and after the first few episodes, I wasn't so sure.  But I stuck with it because I had heard good things about it from more than one person and I am glad I did.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is the best game I have played yet.  The more challenging the levels, the more fun it is to play.
B008602KQI|5.0|The acting is excellent and the story is engaging. I think Jennifer Lawrence is a superb actress. She can play so many different rolls well.
B005TBWN0K|5.0|Extremely handy tool especially if you don't have the software to write on your photos or enter dates and draw more detailed maps!  Great app!
B00B1E6FF8|4.0|Zero Dark Thirty was solid. If you are intrigued by the CIA and how it gathers intelligence, you will throughly enjoy this movie. Don't be intimidated by the length of this movie - it moves briskly and keeps your attention throughout.<br /><br />The movie follows Jessica Chastain's character as she turns over every rock to find America's worst enemy. One of the highlights of the movie is the depiction of Seal Team 6's raid on Bin Laden's compound in Pakistan (as shown in the movie's posters, ads, and trailers). This will keep you on the edge of your seat. Filmed excellently, that scene will make you feel like you are there right alongside Seal Team 6. Wow - what a rush!<br /><br />This movie is worth watching. If you haven't seen it yet, it should definitely be near the top of your list. Entertaining (you will not want to leave your seat until the credits roll), intriguing (feels like you are getting an inside look at how the CIA gathers its intelligence, how the US executes missions, etc), and a great production (five Oscar nominations). It's not the best movie ever made, but so as you are not expecting it to be, you should not be disappointed.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show!! Blood and guys and drama. This was a great season, I can't wait for the next season to start.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|It seems it can never find my location. I don't get any info at all from it. Doesn't cut it.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|Some of the jargon, though probably accurately depicted, was hard to follow , led to distraction and became boring. Found &#34;A Team Of Rivals&#34; gave a better perspective of Lincoln and was more enjoyable to read.
B005LAIII0|5.0|I am glad this won several academy awards. The use of digital and real photography are fantastical well as the story.<br />Acting of the young boy is really good as well.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|It's great because it works with skitch but accessing the notes could be a little easier. Maybe in the future?  Still worth it though.
B009AMANH4|3.0|All in all, a good movie about one of America's greatest leaders. However, before you watch it, please realize that it is a long (two and a half hours) movie with lots of talking. The movie doesn't move very quickly, although the acting performances, cinematography, and directing are top notch.<br /><br />I only rated this three stars because of the following:<br />1) Pace was too slow. I kept engaged because of the acting and historical significance of the movie. It was also interesting seeing 1800s America. But you probably won't be glued to your seat for this movie.<br />2) Not that entertaining for me. When I spend 2 to 3 hours watching a movie, I like to be entertained. Daniel Day Lewis delivered some nice one-liners, but I felt that overall, this movie was more of a history lesson or something along the lines of a History Channel movie. I did not find this movie very entertaining.<br />3) I would not recommend this to my friends. There are too many movies out there that I find more engaging. From 2012 alone, I preferred: Les Mis, Django Unchained, Zero Dark Thirty, Argo, etc., all by a long shot.<br /><br />If you watch this movie, please have moderate expectations. Good production with great acting, but it is obviously a historical piece centered around dialogue and politics. If that's what you're looking for, then this movie is for you. Otherwise, don't expect to be blown away.
B007MDQW3W|5.0|She is got a great voice and the songs are fun and I enjoyed it tremendously on my first listen.
0143058177|3.0|Volume of the reader's voice is not consistent making it difficult to set the right volume level. Didn't realize it was abridged. Would have preferred unabridged.
B00139XTG4|5.0|The book will change the way you look at the world. The book is erudite and funny, an uncanny combination.
B009VMN3RA|5.0|Absolutely captivating!!  Raw and disgusting at times.  I had trouble putting the book down!  Certainly dispelled any ideas that Shirley MacLaine was a loving parent.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|don't have this game.  so I really can't rate it. I hit the &#34;it's okay&#34; button just so I could tell you that I don't have it
B000OLX4SU|5.0|Branagh's movie version of Shelley's \\"Frankenstein\\" is one of the closest recreations of the novel. I showed a clip to my students as a teaser and they couldn't put down the book! Then when they asked to watch the movie, there were no complaints about writing a comparison essay nor was anyone sleeping. Once again, Branagh shows his brilliancy.
B004OR199G|5.0|Buy it. Read it. Do it.<br />You will not regret it, I promise you! It's easy to read and understand and will absolutely serve as an inspiration!!'
B005K17RU0|1.0|This was a better than average weather app with an uncluttered interface and some really nice features.  Now it's an unusable, complicated mess.  I don't understand what the developers were thinking when they made these changes.  I'm uninstalling as soon as I finish typing.
B00BL5EQLC|5.0|very nice, i got it for free on my kindle fire, i already beat it! i think it is worth two dollars. it gets harder and harder as you go on creating a challenging level each time. and i like steam punk. i guess people who dont like the style, or dont like temple run or leps world should not get it. i hope my review helped!
B0041KBWM0|5.0|I love how Emma is portrayed and how funny this is. It is a rather ridiculous Jane Austen book turned movie. I love it.
B00A757EFW|3.0|reminds me of years ago.  Kids and my husband enjoy it. They don't play it as much as some of the other games
B004OR199G|4.0|This explained a method of healthy eating in a way that captures my the interest of anyone reading it. She makes it interesting and fun. I liked the way she explained her own illness and process. Her writing was great and she had my attention from beginning to end.
B00ADQOEDU|4.0|I got amazon prime mainly because this is the only place to see the shield. What a great surprise to see my favorite character of all tv land  Boyd Crowder (Walton Goggens)of justified  is in this series. ive only watched 3 episodes but pretty great so far.. Actually its a tie between Goggens and Olyphant. To anyone who hasnt watched Justified.. JUST DO IT!
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|I really enjoyed the wealth of information in this book, and also the practical &#34;how to do it&#34; side of things. Can't wait to get started on Monday!
B003V9OCS8|5.0|Well done performance and spactacular scenery. I recommend this movie also for the underlying themes of what is it that people want stories on dangerous enterprises.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Yes I would tell people about this wearther they are old or new believes. The plans are a great way to stay on track. This is the most that I have read the Bible without being told to (I was in a private school/church).  This way you can get the word throu a plan if you are going throu something that you might feel know else will understand they have a Bible plan for that within this app.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|All of my grandkids love to play this one they argue over who is the best and taking turns if always debateable
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I bought this book for my Kindle app and I am so glad I did. I would have found such a huge book heavy to carry around and intimidating. On the Kindle it was so easy to have at my fingertips whenever I felt like reading. I enjoyed the story. I had never read it before. I learned a lot from it.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This game is so much fun for a 5 year old. Good hand eye coordination and basic motivation to keep getting better.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|It's a awesome game but I can't believe some awesome dinosaurs cost lots of jurassic park dollars I only have like 15 dollars
B009HNDCC4|4.0|I like this show; it shows different types of current American families and most of the characters are funny. I ended up buying the first four months!
B0064MGU98|5.0|I enjoy the diversity of the various episodes and the way central themes and characters are woven in. Excellent guest stars add new interest as well. Looking forward to series 4!
B0013FNC38|5.0|Jason's music has skyrocketed in the past few years, and for good reason.  I love listening to him as I travel.  This particular cd has the perfect balance of mellow songs and upbeat songs.  I find myself singing them throughout the day, and frankly it just puts me in a great mood.  If you are looking for something fun, purchase this and you won't be disappointed.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|I started to download this app at 12:22 pm. It is now 5:38. Its at 19% I'm patient, but that is way too long to wait. Do NOT buy!
B00AA7V2Z0|3.0|The storyline is somehow simultaneously slow and scrambled for most of the episodes. They don't have enough of the ghosts doing scary ghost things. This show should be called \\"People argue and sometimes there is an anti-climactic murder\\".
B00985E3UG|5.0|I am more than half-way through the book, and I have to say that it is a must-read.  It allows the reader to follow the birth of processed foods and how they hooked us over the years based on three simple ingredients: salt, sugar, and fat.  It is astonishing the lengths these big companies go to - and how hard they work - to keep us gorging their food.  Moss presents his investigations as objectively as possible.  He does not preach one way or the other as to how people should eat - but does inform them what has been going inside our mouths - and waistlines - for the past 60 or so years.  Not only that, but explains just how these ingredients have been used to make us addicts aka \\"heavy users\\".  It is well written and easy to read - no complicated jargon or overly-scientific rhetoric. I recommend this to all readers who are interested to know where their food is coming from - and who is behind it!
B0064MGU98|3.0|I became familiar with this series as it was well on its way in a later season. I find season one a little predictable and stereotypical. But it improves with time. The characters get a chance to develop and become more interesting.
B008602KQI|4.0|Second time I have seen this movie and was still was impressed with the story line .Good job on the producer to keep me interested in watching a movie all the way through to the end .<br /><br /> The only part of this movie that seemed to bug me was the fact that the so called capital rich people ? would let the people in the 12 districts almost starve to death and live in 3rd world type conditions . So the folks living in the ' capital ' won the war , I would think they would want the people who lost to be more productive and better themselves so as to better the life of the people in the capital . The picture I got from the folks living in the capital was that they all are so full of themselves and snobs .
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I have Adobe Reader on my other two other devices and it worked fine, but I haven't used it yet on my Kindle Fire HD.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Enjoyed Killing Floor in the Jack Reacher series which led me to pick up the second book. The book is enjoyable to read with its fast paced action but seemed to introduce new characters and areas of the plot too rapidly for my liking. The way the plot was unravelled is similar to Killing Floor leaving the ending seemingly predictable. An overall enjoyable read but definitely not Lee Childs best. I've had enough of Jack Reacher for a while.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Good characters, plot, suspense.  I look forward to each and every episode.  Trying to discipline myself to make it last.
B00881VLCE|3.0|Fun to work puzzles but sometimes the pieces are haard to see in the small strip on the right. But that's the only problem I have.

B005V5WBFG|1.0|I normally love Amazon and McAfee but the App store purchase that I made for  McAfee protection for my Kindle HD is broke and when I contacted both Amazon support and McAfee support I was given a run around.  Technically the product works but Amazon fails to emphasize tablet security up front.  In this day and age the customer should be provided security preloaded on the device and given a choice at set up of products to secure the device. All tablets are notoriously insecure and security software and antivirus are a must.  Well I paid right away for a year's subscription yesterday and I am still not being given credit for it.  Amazon verified I paid and passed me off the McAfee and then McAfee said well you need to contact customer support tomorrow.  This is unacceptable.

0060555661|5.0|An epic book like this doesn't require a lot of words to divulge its core meaning. The essence of the teachings and idiosyncrasy of the being an independent and enterprising investor is well engraved on stone since the early 20th century when the wit and wisdom of Benjamin Graham was put to paper. His incredible insight into the market simplifies the complexity of investing in a wild era of financial turmoil.<br /><br />Things are made simple in this book. In fact, simple is what it should be. Financial (and technological) advancement has made what is meant to be a clean slate approach to investing a mayhem. Truth be told, though the word-for-word good advice of Benjamin sounds easy but when it comes to emotional control and temperament independence, man always falter.<br /><br />If you want to be a successful investor, there are a lot of teachings in this book to guide you in your path to be one.<br />If you want to be a rich speculator, riding the waves of the wild and crazy world of finance, read something else.<br />But st aside a stash of cash because in time to come, you will need it - because you violated the \\"margin of safety\\" rule.<br /><br />Be warned.

B0026772N8|5.0|Great book with very informative information that the reader will enjoy and appreciate. I recommend this book to anyone that's looking for a great read. This book is awesome!!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Cannot wait for the new season to come up. Its a nice glimpse of how war affects us all specially how it affected the aristocrats.
B0063M22QO|5.0|This mahjong is fun to play and to pass the time with.  It works wonderfully for my Kindle Fire HD.  I like it.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I can tell that reading this book is going to get me hooked into reading the whole series.  I watched the movie before reading and finishing this book and I gotta say...they left out a WHOLE lot in the movie from the book.  The book was way better than the movie in my opinion.  I can't wait to start book two and get further in this series.  I recommend this book to anybody of all ages who enjoys a story with a plot full of suspense and characters you fall in love with! =)  I bet you'll be wanting more when your done!
0345534379|1.0|I bought this book for one of my students and was very disappointed when it arrived.  In fact, I used it as an example for all of my students to know what you are buying.  It wouldn't have mattered so much that it was in black and white if they had retained the original size.  All in all a big rip off!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I watched the first season alone, then convinced my husband to watch just one episode. He was hooked! Now we can't wait for Season 4. This is definitely a character-based drama. There's plenty going on, but we quickly find ourselves drawn into the daily life of Downton Abbey. The Brits always do wonderful period drama and this is no exception in my opinion.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Now on road trips, I can play minecraft. Sure it doesn't have as many things as the computer, but can you<br />log on minecraft in the middle of nowhere, no. But minecraft pe is good, it's worth the money
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I found that this app is more reliable than my alarm clock especially when the power goes out.  I woke up to the alarm going off on my Kindle Fire and the sight of my electric alarm clock flashing with no alarm going off.  My Alarm Clock on my Kindle works for me.
B0096DFBZQ|5.0|This game is alsome I can't believe that this is the greatest game ever.I also like it because you can go fast on the car.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|You may never see reality TV in the same light after viewing this movie. Reading the books helps, by the way...
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|The game rocks and the option of buying gems I rule out because you can earn them free in a) the colisseum and/or b) the Race Track. :-):-):-):-)
B000002J09|5.0|Well they really got better with this one due to stairway to heaven . I believe that is their best one at this time keep on rocking.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I could only think of a few things about this app.  It's great and it comes in handy whenever I want to know the weather conditions.
B004XXIHS2|5.0|Ira Levin wrote his first novel in 1950 concerning the murderous activities of a young gold-digger, world war two veteran.  Although dated it provides plenty of suspense, plot twists and surprise ending.  Couldn't put it down once I started.  A good read!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|love this series and i can not wait for 2014 to begin.  i guess i am required to go on and on about this
B007V2UGPE|4.0|I am really enjoying the game so far. I am just confused about the cards.... I recommend it to anyone.
B002E2QHBS|5.0|To really understand woodstock you had to be there to really enjoy that time. Do to taping it people that was not there can see how it chance the time of that day. It showed the old ones that the young could do a great party and do it in peace and love. No war zone just love.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I have Angry Birds on my other two devices and it worked great.  I loved it and even had put it on my Kindle Fire HD for my friend to try it out.  It's an addictive game, you can't put it down.
1451695195|4.0|I like this book-a lot of medical conversation throughout. This book goes just a little deeper than just stating what he saw-a little boring a times but I am glad I read it.
B000FA675C|3.0|There are a number of best-selling writers who have a talent for telling a story but lack the skills to really pull off the task, and based on the number of copies sold, Dan Brown is near the head of the class. Superb story telling skills, but at times nothing less than dreadful writing. You can blame the editor and publisher, but it isn't their name emblazoned in gold on the cover.<br /><br />What could be a riveting tale involving high energy physics, Papal politics and history frequently comes to a screeching halt because of clumbsy language, hackneyed situations, and logic loops. Forget all the complaints about historical and scientific innacuracies; this is a story, and the author has license to invent. But craft? If the author lacks the craft, it behooves the editors and publishers to add some.
B000TRXRUY|5.0|es una las mejores peliculas de bru lee aunque laas prefiriria en espanol y un excelente video en hd seria mejor claro que me gusto  son classicas
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|This was a great book, it started a little slow but after a little bit it gets better, good read
B004JK61K0|3.0|I tried to get my email through this and it was too complicated to do.  I wish I could get email through my Kindle Fire HD.
B0078Q2HAA|4.0|Maggie Thatcher was one of the greatest world leaders in my lifetime, arguably of all time.  The first (and so far only) female Prime Minister of Great Britain, the &#34;Iron Lady&#34; lead her country from turmoil 1979 to just beyond the end of the Cold War in 1990. The movie, set in her final doddering years, shows her rise in politics and her relationship with her husband, Dennis, through flashbacks.  This enables the film to show but gloss over the phenomenal accomplishments of her leadership and, instead, show her as a frail old lady who sees and talks to her dead husband.  That's likely the best a great Conservative leader can receive from today's Hollywood.  The elements are there but her successes pass by almost too quickly to see.  All that being said, Meryl Streep as the &#34;doddering old Lady Thatcher&#34; is phenomenal.  She looks like, sounds like, walks like..... well, she IS Margaret Thatcher.  And watching her alone is worth the price of admission.
B005DJREJS|4.0|This series was most likely meant for teenagers, but it brought back all the awkward memories and managed to make them funny.  I was hooked and loved season 1 and 2.
B001R60ESE|5.0|Came across the BluRay featured on another website and after seeing clips and reading reviews of the visual/audio quality, I had to purchase.  Let's just say is did not disappoint.  The clarity and tone of Chris and other musicians is superb and truly a job to listen too.  Definitely one of the finer Live in Concert BluRays in my collection.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|All the books in this series are wonderful reads.  Some are better than others, but when compared against other series, this is one of the best.  This book is sans &#34;amazing&#34; moments found in some of he other books, but it's hard to craft one of those moments.  They just happen.  A couple of the story threads become a little maddening, since main characters tend to brush against one another without interaction.  But that's really the lone complaint I have.
0765365278|5.0|The book arrived in fantastic condition, obviously used, but well taken care of.<br /><br />The book so far has been a great read, and I'm only about 240 pages in.<br /><br />The book has me on the edge of the seat, excited every time I get a spare moment to read it.
B008OW1S3O|5.0|This album is great from start to finish. They have such a unique and great sound. I would definitely recommend this.
B007SO31BQ|5.0|Whether you are a fan of F1 racing or not, this documentary is offers a fantastic and emotional look into one of racing's greatest drivers.  It's hard not to watch without becoming emotionally involved:  smiling, angry, and sad at times - you will feel it all.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I was skeptical of this updated version of the Sherlock Holmes canon.  There have been so many interpretations and so many bad adaptations over the years.  But in a short (3-episode x apprx 90 min) season this one has made a fine start.  Holmes is a brittle young prima donna, but ultimately sympathetic, and Watson is brilliant as a modern medically-retired Afghan-war vet (readers of the original stories will appreciate this heritage), who may not be as brilliant as his roommate, but is grounded and brave and essential to the solution of some mysteries.  Equally interesting are the villains supporting characters, including some you know from other movies and TV series, all updated for the 21st century, but essentially still of Baker Street and its shroud of mystery.  The pilot episode is fully developed -- if you like it you will probably enjoy the rest of the series.  If not, don't bother with the other two.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This is a really enjoyable program.  We had to restrain ourselves and watch only two at a time to make them last.
1439152802|5.0|The deeper I went into this story, the more mesmerized I was by the characters and their masterfully woven tale. This is Morton at her very finest. I've read all of her books and this is my favorite so far and, in fact, one of the best books I have ever read. All I can add is simply more, please, more!
B0037VNX44|3.0|The movie was not exactly what I expected when looking for a movie about \\"Britain's most notorious prisoner\\".  But it was an interesting theatrical presentation, and Tom Hardy did a pretty stellar job.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|Great show..Gets even better season 2 and 3. Season 1 felt a little formulaic at first, but then takes you to some new ground. In order to enjoy the show, you have to get through season 1...Only in Season 2, or 3 does this show really fly!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|this game. is. cool and fun for all ages 1-99 (kidding) the world of Hungry Shark Evolution never ends, well, if it does then I haven't. gotten there yet
B004V6BQ3O|5.0|its a good size and works well. I like that I don't have to use a battery with it.<br />Its nice to have a mic that you can adjust direction and sound.
B000000XB8|5.0|Creedence Clearwater Revival - Chronicle (2 LP 180g)<br /><br />  It all really started for &#34;the revival&#34; back in 1967 and ended really in 1972 with the release of their seventh and final album.  John and Tom Fogerty, Stu Cook and Doug Clifford brought us so many great songs and great albums along their journey.  No question they were rolling......rolling.....rolling on the river!<br />  Although I have all their albums I had to pick up the Fantasy 2 LP remastered version set on 180g vinyl and what a sound ! No question CCR were an amazing rock band and their music will live with me forever.<br />  Chronicle was originally released back in 1972 and as a kid my brother and I listened to this compilation over and over and wore out the grooves.  I was so excited to see this album had been so carefully put all back together so well.<br />  Of course all the classics are here...in fact 20 of them !  &#34;Have you ever seen the rain&#34; and &#34;Lodi&#34; are two of my personal favourite CCR track and hearing these again in such clarity made my jaw drop!<br />  Gotta love CCR!!!!
B0002GTWQA|5.0|Lord Jim is an epic film based on Joseph Conrad's novel. Peter O'Toole is great as always with excellent supporting actors. Bronislau Kaper's score is excellent. The anamorphic widescreen picture is good but not excellent. I look forward to having this film in Blu-ray someday.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I have become addicted to this game I play all the time its a great game to get totaly worth the $
B001BIMYXQ|4.0|Eurythmics were always one of those bands that I thought were really good, Annie has an amazing and distinct voice, Dave is a great writer/producer, but I never LOVED them.  I love some of their tunes but I never really liked their albums as a whole.  This is a good singles collection but there are some weak songs on it.  I'm sure there are some better ones from the 80s they could have included.
B000VKW7AK|4.0|The old albums (especially Rust In Peace) are amazing.  It was a staple for me as a headbanger back in the late eighties early nineties.  But they started to lose me around 'Cryptic Writings'.<br /><br />Here's why and what what you should do if you are fairly new to Megadeth:<br />Check out something newer like 'Public Enemy No. 1' from the album 'Th1rteen'.  Or, in my personal opinion, check out the older stuff like 'Holy Wars', 'Hangar 18', or 'Angry Again'!<br />This band has gone through numerous changes, injuries, etc as you would expect from a band that's been around nearly 30 years!!<br />They are going to change with times.  Singers will lose their range and uniqueness.  They have gone through injuries, changes, etc etc etc.<br />A lots gone on in 30+ years and no artist will stay the same.  Obviously they need to grow artistically.  Megadeth has done that - BUT they do stay true to their roots.  They are slightly political, very thrash, atmospheric (especially the older stuff) play tight, play fast, play intricate.  And rock so damn hard they don't dare jump around on stage or miss a beat.<br />Check these guys out, but in my opinion do it first as the original CD's or MP3's, after that, then by this. I want to say buy this first but you only get the 'essentials'.  Listen to the CD's as they were meant to be heard FIRST!  This is for veterans and collectors - if you fall into THAT category then why are you still reading this?! - just buy it.<br /><br />Specifically about this:  It's a mix of live, remastered, and original tracks.  Some of the 'original' tracks sound different to me (could be just me).  The remastered tracks are too polished and have lost that original venom.  The live stuff ranges from awesome (they are known for sounding great in concert but have no stage presence in my opinion) to downright embarrassing (listen to the vocals on track 3 - Hangar 18 Live at Wembly).<br />Do yourself a favor and buy the originals first - collect this later.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|For someone who used to ride and show horses it kinda blows you away. I love this game!! I would recommend it to parents and horse lovers everywhere.
B00BX8653O|5.0|... been listening to Ólafur Arnalds for a while and my personal opinion is that this is some of his best work.<br /><br />Give it try! I promise you'll like it!<br /><br />Cheers!
B00136NUG6|5.0|it just doesn't get any better than this.  amazing songwriting, singing, musicianship, funky 70s soul pop.  LOVE IT!!!  LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!
B002MJV75O|1.0|...and purchasing the individual seasons doesn't help.  A lot of the music is different, which ruins many scenes.  And, some scenes are cut out completely.  This is happening too often with TV shows and movies.  I was under the impression that DVDs are supposed to be superior to VHS, but in many cases, it's not true.  It's tough because VHS tapes wear out,  But I'm hoping I'll be able to convert them to DVD so that I can watch the GOOD versions.  I'm so disappointed in these DVDs that it makes me want to cry!  Zero stars!!
B0091REZMW|5.0|tons of fun! my type of game lots to do. and very entertaining most fun game ever. I play everyday. worth playing
B00BU18U82|5.0|We live on a farm and my boys are addicted to this game they play it all the the time and they love it. They just love driving tractors all around.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This was such a good story. Well developed characters and a good plot too. Already reread it 3 times, didn't want it to end.
B00AFOS8A0|4.0|I've received in February this fantastic collection with the most important verdian recordings of all time but with two little problems. IT'S NOT INCLUDED THE LOST ARIAS FROM MACBETH. The only recording that includes that four arias is the Muti' superb recording  with Cossotto, Milnes , Carreras in LP . When EMI made the CD edition, those arias where not included till today, as I remember. It is strange that the group has not selected the Macbeth with Cossotto instead the Verrett version, marvelous of course, but without that important extras.<br />The second problem is the quality of the box material. If we make a little more pression when we mantain the box opened it is possible that you broke the thin paper used to join the cover to the box. BUT WHO CARES AT THIS PRICE? BUY THIS COLLECTION WITHOUT DOUBTS AND... OPEN THE BOX CAREFULLY.
B004LP3AYI|4.0|Continuation of a very well put together fantasy world.  Vile evil vs ethical if not entirely innocent good.  Fantasy, magic and fun sword play.
B00BWGISB4|5.0|I absolutely adore this album.  The music is catchy, up-to-date, crisp, fresh, and a pleasant change from the music that is currently out there.  Unlike, The Block, this album is one that I would feel comfortable with other family members (much younger family members) to listen.  10 reminded me of the boy band that I grew up, but with a more adult sound.<br /><br />I would most certainly recommend this album to anyone who loves the New Kids On The Block, and I would certainly recommend this album to those who have absolutely no idea who they are.
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|My husband and I enjoy the songs and I thought the price of $9 for a new CD was very reasonable.
B00992CF6W|5.0|If u like LEGO, u sure will like this game. Very addicting, and brings imagination to the edge. soooooo coool
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This book is a fun easy read that is very well written and descriptive. The book covers the globe and causes one to think. Very interesting.
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|I previously wrote that this was nothappy with the lack of 3D disc.  When I bought the blu ray combo pack I entered in my disney points at disneymovierewards.com and was offered to buy the 3D disc for 5.99 with no shipping.  This is just like any other combo pack!!! I give it 4 and 1/2 for the run around.  The 3D is one of the best 3D films I have seen.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|As one of few women execs in a large oil and gas company, I am working hard to move things forward in my company.  Sheryl just helped  in a major way.  This book has something for everyone, whether you are a stay at home mom, a working woman, or a man who has a partner, co worker, or friend who is a women, read this book.  You will get an insight that will help you understand and help us all lean in.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It`s pretty much an awesome portable edition of minecraft,I can play with my friends. I have minecraft on my Xbox 360 and minecraft PE is better!!!!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I loved it can't wait to see the movie. I read the book in one sitting couldn't put it down
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Definitely worth the effort to get through. A great book that shows just what some people will do for love
B0024Y9EYS|3.0|Has this theme been rerun, repeated and re-shown enough yet??  So what is new in this remake of it?  Nothing!!
B000YMM3CC|5.0|Beyond most films, you will find, and feel, something about Love too seldom told: It's easy to fall in love, sometimes too easy;<br />if you are truly fortunate you might discover this film's worthy secret, that the one loved beyond expectation, beyond your prior<br />imagination, finds you worthy of being loved.  Simply told, but valid, it reminds us of e. e. cummimngs eternal truth: &#34;One is not half two, It's two are halves of One.&#34;
B00BF11STU|5.0|This should have one the OSCARS I am not sure about  the politics of Hollywood but the tension on this is so consitent and you have to keep reminding yourself that this is real and that even though they are trying to help us get it is so hard to fathom. Very intense. ​
B009YP9L7U|3.0|This was a quick fun read with great sexual tension, well written dialogue and cute premise that provided a believable enough basis for a modern day marriage of convenience story. I enjoyed the breezy tone and while I would have enjoyed more detail about the characters lives outside the relationship, the short length doesn't allow for much, but that's not the author's fault.<br />Yet there were things that just didn't add up. The heroine wants a baby, though I never understood why. We're told repeatedly how strong and independent she is but her actions within the relationship do not bear this out. The hero is rather dictatorial ,not only in the bedroom, and she has no issues about marriage to a man who speaks to her this way. His history provides solid reasons why he would want an emotionally strong spouse but when his full story is revealed it felt like a contradiction of the clues we are given before.<br />Overall, not a bad book but not wholly satisfying either. Still I would read another book from this author and harlequin Kiss.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|My bluray arrived on time and in good condition. Love all the special features and the interactive menus! My only question is why so many discs on bluray? But whatevs, it's game of thrones!
B009Q6ADG0|1.0|This is not Adele, and there are only 2 songs on the disc..This is a total rip off..don't buy it..
B0009VSB06|4.0|I'd like to be able to test this detector and tell you awesome it is, but unfortunately I bought it from Amazon and it's missing pieces! Looks like, I'm out money for a pile of useless junk. Thanks a bunch Amazon!
B004I2K4E8|5.0|We have seen Les Mis several times especially with Wilkinson as the lead singer.  Great show summaries.  If you are a Les Mis fan, you will enjoy this CD.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|so many products use this item from clocks & cameras to games that it makes sense to buy in quantity.  pretty good life also.
B0055MBQOM|5.0|Problem with photos never looking the same out of the printer as they did on the screen.  After adjusting the monitor to a color standard, and making sure the printer was using the same color standard, photos looked much better.  Easy to use, no problems.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|They always have something new or an excitingly good cliff hangar  to keep you hooked! Can't wait until next season!!
B002QRWJA4|5.0|This is a movie version that I've always liked. I am glad I can now add it to my home selection.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was floored by this story.  I laughed and I cried.  The story is very well written.  The characters have such depth to their personalities.  I loved how their lives were so entwined throughout the plot.  This story should make it to the big screen.  Ms. Hoover you have a new fan.
B004D5H2M2|5.0|Virgin Years: 1974-1978 is a compilation that collects tracks from the 5 LPs that Tangerine Dream recorded for Virgin Records between 1974 and 1978 and is a mix of ambient, electronic music and electronica. A great compilation that should not be missed! Highly recommended. 5/5.
6302752337|5.0|I bought this movie for a friend who had one too many motorcycle accidents.  He now must just enjoy watching the motorcycle exploits of others and this movie was perfect for him.
B00007KWHG|5.0|During the 1960s the only group that came close to selling as many records as the Beatles was the Four Seasons.  This music still rocks decades later.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|We decided to have a family movie night. I chose this movie at random and to my delight both of my boys (3 and 5 years of age) were immediately engaged and as was I. We loved this movie! We watched it twice in 24hours. It was funny and had loveable, relate-able characters. It was a worth while story to watch. It also reiterated to my children that darkness is always there but that does not mean you should fear it. You are your own Guardian. I fell in love with the characters and my kids also loved them. Jack Frost the most. XD One of the best random movie picks we have ever had. I plan on purchasing this movie soon. Great film!
B000J670ZI|5.0|Want to laugh?  See this movie.  Great actors!  How Hepburn keeps yapping without losing her breath the whole time is unbelievable  and Grant...what movie has he done that isn't good?
B009UNGYHG|5.0|This product is so convenient. You can carry it around when you are not using it and also charge it at the same time. Compact and looks good also. Delivery was very prompt also. Actually received it one day before the expected delivery date. Thanks ...
B0061PEAUY|3.0|I think Kathy Reichs has character fatigue.<br /><br />With the exception of learning to avoid making snap judgements, Tempe and Ryan learned nothing about themselves or their relationship. In fact they both act like snotty kids.<br /><br />I was shocked when, as a plot point, Ryan forced Tempe to take a drink to steady her nerves. A huge part of Tempe is her hard won sobriety and her adherence to not touching a drop of alcohol. That Ryan would be such a jerk a to force alcohol on her, lost me as a fan of his.<br /><br />The bad guys were revealed slowly and I didn't see a couple of them coming. The reason for the crimes was a new one, but I had an inkling of the reason when a small bag of gravel was part of crime scene.<br /><br />This book has no spark to speak of. It will hold you on an airplane, but if you have other choices, take them. This book is nothing to write home about.
B004GYY714|5.0|This app is the ultimate music app! If you want music, you NEED this! Best music in the universe and it's history!!!
B0011Z32KI|5.0|Another set of good music to have. He is one of my favorite singers! He can make you sing with him all the time.
B00AQCMK32|5.0|... but I was wrong. I am totally hooked. What a great game. So far, I have drained my battery twice on my Kindle Fire HD playing this.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Spider is one of those must have brain work outs. Clean and user friendly start and end to the day with quick and easy workout.simple fun
B007Z9QP3K|4.0|Das Boot provides a rare glimpse into what it was like to serve under a fanatical Fuhrer as part of the U-boat navy. In times when the wolf packs reigned supreme over the Atlantic, and then, as the tide began to turn against them.<br />This isn't a polished MGM war movie for sure, but serves to provide a true picture of the real frailties and excesses of character in those who served under wartime conditions. The Captain of Das Boot rendered an extreme performance in this movie.<br />This movie should be seen by all war buffs and those who appreciate history, from any prospective ( even the enemy's ).
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|The perfect ending. I have spent literally half my life reading this series and waiting for the next book, hoping for and dreading the end. Sanderson accomplished something I was afraid I'd never see. Not only AN ending to one of the greatest epic series ever written, but THE PERFECT one.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|Love the way everything can be accessed from a single location, and the pageflip animation works really well.<br />The only thing I would add is possibly the ability to integrate it with other apps, just as email and calendar.
B0052AC8C6|3.0|Ok, cute movie, good wit with a story line older then the Wild West. Not one that grabs you and holds you to the end.
B0017SWSCW|5.0|This is the second time I've read this book. I absolutely love it and would recommend it to anyone. It's my opinion that you'd be hard pressed to find many books this entertaining, this thought out and this utterly satisfying.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|The whole series was addictive but I actually enjoyed each one less than the one before it.  Became too repetitive.
044042321X|5.0|the art work is great i didnt buy kindle edition cause i want to appreciate the artwork this delivered.love it cant wait for volume 2 thanks
B008602KQI|3.0|I was one that expected more! While I haven't read the book, it's like I'd seen this before. Maybe a television series with the see you next time same bat time same bat channel.
B007QJ8VBI|5.0|This is one of my all time favorites! Glorious Cary Grant, funny and enchanting Doris Day. I downloaded this while on vacation in Rome one evening.  Sitting around with some American friends of mine talking about oldies but goodies. We said why don't we watch a Doris Day movie right now, and we did . . . A total hit!
B002UPA4ZY|5.0|Great DVD!  I liked it so much that I also purchased the CD.  It was a great concert!  Service and shipping were great.<br />It was great to see something different during the holidays and I would recommend this to everyone who enjoys the christmas holidays with great music and guests.
B0053O89KG|5.0|. . .and frankly, I could watch &#34;Castle&#34; episodes all day every day! I really enjoy their humor. Having the entire season is great!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I had heard about this book and thought, &#34;A DOG tells the story?!?  That's REALLY strange!!&#34;  Well, being a dog lover, I couldn't resist.  This was an excellent story.  Heartwarming, to say the very least.  I definitely recommend this book.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|I loved Downton Abby....started watching this since I had seen all of the episodes and anxiously awaiting more...this is good...but no comparison...
B003K16P3M|2.0|What does this author have against marriage? Seriously. I found it disturbing (particularly because this book is aimed at middle and HS kids) that she kept bringing up the marriage issue over and over again in a not-so-sublte negative light and went on to espouse, again, over and over ....how much more noble and loving it was to just take a lover and both be free to walk away when their feelings for ea. other changed. I'm not a prude or anything but it was so blaringly out of place... like the author had an agenda she was pushing...esp. when that soapbox philosophy really added nothing new to the story by the fourth or fifth time. What the heck is THAT all about?<br /><br />Other than that... the story was just okay for me. Too repetitive for my taste. The plot was given away too early on and the resolution at the end was so non-climatic and brief that it was rather disappointing. I did like some of the characters and thought they were well-developed but others, namely, the villain was way too one-dimensional to make it engaging enough.<br /><br />I listened to the audio version of Graceling and HAVE to say the voicing of Katsa and others was excellent but I absolutely LOVED the actor who voiced Po's (such an unfortunate name) character. I could listen to that dude ALL the day long. Mesmerizing.
B0063IH60K|5.0|great game..great way to pass the time.  recommend to everyone.  fun for all ages and abilities. 100% family friendly fun!
B0085TKAW6|4.0|I like how history is incorporated into the novel and the fictional characters interact with real people and real events
B00BN4URSW|4.0|While some elements are a bit far fetched, it is a movie and an exciting one at that. It's pretty amazing to see both Cruise and Fox carry a whole film.  Some cool cameos from Jada Pincket and Mark Ruffalo, as well.
B007L5GDGW|4.0|It starts out slow and speeds up. The image shows what you have to do. You need to lean the phone to get it to turn.
0345803485|5.0|Loved this book. Once i started reading i couldnt put it down. I own the whole set. I like that someone with money looked at someone that had none. THat was nice
B00130EVSS|3.0|I was expecting great things since Vigo is so good, but didn't get much. There was constant &#34;over-acting&#34; like you see in a high school play which makes you realize you're watching a movie instead of getting lost in the story.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Ignore the historical inaccuracies and just revel in the costumes, drama and all the beautiful people! Definiely some not-so-clean fun.  The BBC version has some extra scenes, but both will satisfy.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|Just like super mario bros on a phone. You need to use both your hands to play this game. I like it.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I didn't expect much from the start but as soon as I figured out the goals and the extra help bombs, I played it everyday until I got all 3 stars on every level. I still have 2 levels that I only achieved 2 stars so I can't stop playing until I get perfect scores. But mostly my battery drains so that's when I take a break.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|One of the many books I adore!! Fast paced and adventurous! Bad ending! :/ you can't just stop it there cab you??!!
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|My kids a and I take t turns playing t this game. Helps with h hand, eye coordination. Best one yet keep. Keep them coming
B006OOHYIC|4.0|If you like challenging puzzle games from the instant you start playing it, skip this one. It is swipe based game were the challenge is that it does not let you change directions in the middle of a move (from the starting place to the wall).
B006X5L6VS|3.0|haven't really figured it out yet or used it much. one two three four five six seven eight nine ten ( they said I needed 10 more words)
B009CF7GRY|3.0|Cute remake and modern flare. Just wasn't completely my thing. Glad to hear some remakes of old sound track. \\"I'm totally Loose!...\\"
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|MY FAMILY & I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! We watched this all the time on Netflix until they took it off. My son & husband found it on their & we are so glad we bought it for ourselves on Amazon. Thanks
B009IUH1N2|4.0|It is a game that relies on your swiping ability and reaction time. The game's challenge progresses quickly, which is the reason  I gave it four stars.
B0001GMIOE|4.0|My old camera and battery were over 10yrs old.. so it was time. I don't have a lot of local stores here, so I rely on the web to purchase things. So I know I can always rely  on Amazon to have what I need at the better price.
B006Z949XY|5.0|I found this picture pretty straightforward. Mumble is grown and has a young one named Eric,an immensely shy little penguin, who like his father, has trouble expressing himself. Despite his parents encouragement,his one attempt causes an embarrassing moment. When Ramon tries to lend support, he is blown off and on his way back to Adelieland finds he has company when Erik follows allow with two friends. Mumble follows and proceeds to try to get the young ones to return. It is here that Erik meets Sven, a charismatic Puffin from the far North, who met Lovelace aboard a ship and believes him to be a penguin who can fly and who teaches Erik that whatever he wills is his. At that moment,an earthquake shakes the area, pushing a huge iceberg ahead of itself and when the penguins get back to Emperorland,they discover the iceberg has blocked the group inside a deep bowl with no way out. Mumble then tries to enlist what help he can as he strives to help however he can. Lovelace tries to attract the help of the aliens and they do come, but can't stay because a storm drives them away. The Adelies do their best to help by fishing until the storm freezes the ice. It is by dancing that Mumble has figured a way to free the Emperors when he and the Adelies shake the snow against the berg, but it isn't enough and he must enlist the aid of the Elephant Seals and Erik discovers he can sing and does so to persuade the stubborn seals to help. Together, they manage to break the ice to free the Emperors. Bill and Will Krill in the meantime,in their journey of self discovery and to lead the swarm to safer waters also help inadvertantly to break the berg because they believe the dancing means something. The movie does have its drawbacks, the Krills seem a bit disjointed and it flows a bit unevenly, but beyond that, it was a fairly straight story with great music and good characters. One I would recommend.
B005DJREJS|2.0|Just as high school was the first time a waste of time, this show was too.  Not sure why I even watched in the first place.
B0011Z10PC|4.0|Raw, pulsing energy with introspective and provocative lyrics which ring true. Green Day is a &#34;must have&#34; part of anyone's music collection.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|Very heavy going.  Not a book I would recommend.  The author's descriptions are very drawn out, but I suppose that was how  writers wrote and people spoke in those days.  I can only hope the film is better.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|I was blown away by the amount of bonus features included on the blu-ray. It blows the old collectors edition dvd out of the sky.
B007DA2FHG|3.0|A good story.  Well acted.  What was done with the plane is beyond its aerodynamic design and not possible. It was not believable.
B003FVI2KQ|5.0|The time had come for an upgrade from an x3 forced to use its fourth processor, to a real x6.  I plugged in the new processor, set it for 3.6 GHz, and just plain run .... no muss nor fuss.  The speed boost was immediately apparent.  Under a full load with the stock fan, the processor gets a bit warm at 48C.  Otherwise it runs at 40C.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Really nice book it was really interesting I can't wait for the next book the house of Hades<br /><br />Really looking forward to it
B001EN71CW|5.0|This was my first dvd to blu-ray conversion, and I'm glad I did. The menus are much smoother than on the dvds. Plus, we get a few bonus blu-ray features.<br /><br />The roundtable discussion is definitely the highlight. While not terribly in depth, it was fun watching some of the cast back together laughing and exchanging stories. The new commentary on Our Mrs. Reynolds was a cherry on top.<br /><br />For all Browncoats out there, I highly recommend making the same transition.
159562015X|5.0|This book encourages one to believe in oneself and is useful and practical for life. Great.  I would purchase from this author again.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|For all the guys and gals who serve in the military. Thanks for protecting us. A true story of taking out the bad guys!
145210655X|5.0|My husband is a Star Wars fan, so of course in 2011 when we found out we were expecting boy/girl twins the first thing that came out of his mouth is he wanted to name them luke and leia. It of course was a joke since im just barely getting into star wars myself, but Ever since then thou we have agreed they are our little luke and leia. So when we saw this book at B&N a few months ago my husband was over joyed. he sat and showed our then almost 1 year old son the pictures and just was so happy. Of course i hate spending the actual retail price for books even more so when its a cute gift idea and something that wont be used everyday, so i told my husband to wait and we would find it somewhere else cheaper. My husband deployed and since hes been gone hes missed Christmas and our wedding anniversary. When i got on today and saw that they were coming out with a pricess leia version i KNEW i had to order both of them since this is the perfect gift for my husband. Even more so when i can get both books for the price of just the one at B&N.<br /><br />I love the cute pictures and its not a story time type book, but something perfect for all the star wars lover in all of us. :)
B00APKIN1I|5.0|One of the greatest music compilations of all time. If you are true music fan you must get this album.
B009IUH1N2|4.0|I love running games like this one... just wish it was longer because it has left me wanting harder levels and more bosses.
B007PVHMCG|4.0|Lego master child is thrilled with this. I had hoped that it would take him significantly longer to complete, but in two ours it was built. Very nice that although the pieces are small it still works with other Lego.
B0089LOG02|3.0|I enjoyed the storyline very much; however, the filthy language in so many places was unnecessary and made me lower my rating. And one particular episode, involving molestation of the child, was so disturbing and graphic that I threw my Kindle down and felt sick. Therefore, I would not recommend this book to my friends, or grandchildren, to read.
B009D0LBRO|2.0|I am sure many would like this game, but it is not for me.  You just run this guy through the jungle and make him jump from here to there and collect something (haven't figured out what they are), to the finish line.  I will stick to puzzle games that require more thought and less dexterity.
B005HI4LMS|3.0|This film was only mildly entertaining, which I felt was lousy because I had such high hopes. Essentially, minus the British accents, this movie is like &#34;Mr Bean with a chainsaw.&#34;<br />This movie failed on so many levels, but mostly because it was clearly playing to the lowest possible denominator. This is obvious in the way all the possible stereotypes of the characters in this movie were displayed.<br />Dumb luck also plays an important part in this movie. I know that it's a movie, and since it's just a movie, I should willfully suspend disbelief, but I can't help it.Just like &#34;I am who I am&#34;, &#34;a substantially mediocre film is a substantially mediocre film.&#34;
B000PY6BBI|5.0|If you loved the 80s, smart comedy, and cheesy music, this movie is for you. Broderick is the funniest I've ever seen him (including Ferris Bueller's Day Off).
B00BRYDKM8|4.0|Thank you, Akash, for wording your extensive research into what makes a memorable speech in a clear and concise hands-on booklet. The acronyms help retain the information you give. You really practice what you preach right to the letter in writing your book. The wealth of resources in your book linking to the speeches you use as an example are downright fabulous for the \\"lazy\\" reader. Now we don't have to look up the speeches ourselves anymore. They are but a click away!
B00A7L00XE|4.0|Not the best CD i own! But its priceless to hear these too men create a album together! The tracks are fairly simple and real traditional bluesy! I love putting it on in my room when i get up in the morning.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Great movie, great action and the computer graphics were amazing.  I would recommend it to young and old. Bring out some more like that
B0017SWPXY|1.0|I did not go far into this book before finding filthy language so I returned it.  It could have been a very good book to read except for the unnecessary dirty language.
B0094WK9GU|4.0|This cd was everything I could imagine and more. I'm absolutely in love with Swedish House Mafia! The reason I gave this 4 stars though is because the cd was scratched when I got it, even though I purchased it brand new. The doesn't make me happy....
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|I know what people are saying about this album. Im sure someone is making tons of money off of this but we can only hope its for all the right reason! The CD is worth it! The Tracks are mastered and mixed!<br /><br />It simpley is the last great glimpse into the mind of Jimi Hendrix and the top of his growth as a musician and producer. You can hear Jimi charactistics in everysong and feels like the direction we all hoped jimi would of lived to create!<br /><br />i recommend buying this album if your a fan of the Hendrix
B00A0NOF7G|5.0|Very well written with a cute story. It catches you from the first page from the mystery to romance at the end.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Lots fun and easy to do!  I love the different dragon characters.<br />GETTING other dragon eggs may seem difficult at first.  Just keep trying and you will get one.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Had fun, enjoyed the graphics.  Could use more of a challenge as it progresses.  Look forward to more releases over time.
B00009AOBI|5.0|Hadn't seen Mask in a long time even better than i remembered!Absolutely worth watching!Great story and i've been a Sam Elliot fan for quite a while!
B008393Q2O|4.0|I'm using a Samsung Galaxy Note II, and tired of the S Note interface that always thinks I'm drawing a picture instead of entering a to-do list.  Amazon offered this notepad for free on April 11, 2013.  I tested it in the browser, liked it, and downloaded it.  Installation takes seconds, and it works slightly better than S Note.  The odd issue is hitting Back to save every new note, every new item on every checklist... you get the idea.  Otherwise, does a nice job.
0385349947|5.0|I purchased this for my 3 oldest granddaughters. They are out in the world making their way. They love the book, and say they will use much of it in their own lives, as they go forward.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Nice to have something without the ads for a change as they are annoying.  Enjoy the challenge but could use even more.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Most people think Angry Bird is just got the kids, try it you will love the challenge of getting to the next level. I find when I'm worried about something or I have to wait for an appointment it keeps my mind occupied.

B00947N6UG|5.0|Great adventure did not think anything could beat Wreck it Ralph but this comes really close. It was a fun movie and it kept the kids entertained which is what really counts.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|I think that if you don't upgrade your stuff often, it gets very hard to beat a level in the game.
B00A9T1HUO|4.0|Every release can not be the best, but I enjoy it. What's not to like if you enjoy Josh. Go for it.
B003U4UNPK|5.0|Sometimes the quality gets down graded from hd to standard.  This is being viewed on roku.  Other than that, enjoying the series fora second time.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Amazing adventure of a movie. Mystical and funny at times.  Unbelievable compassion, empathy and realistic.  You should experience this movie first hand
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|This game is boring a kiddiesh because you need internet for the game to work and I'm not always at an hotspot most of the time. Dragons seriously? I should've known :(
B008393Q2O|3.0|If you bracelets already it's not necessary, I found it to be a bit confusing to understand but maybe it's just me. I'm sure most people will like it. I prefer the sticky notes.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I have read military history for 40 years and this is one of the best books I have read.  The writing is fun, clear and interesting and does a wonderful job of describing both characters and battles.<br /><br />But what separates this book is that it is unusual in that it follows the story arcs of characters on both sides of the air war in Europe in World War II between the Germans and the Americans straight through to one of maost amazing and interesting encounters of the war.<br /><br />I strongly urge you to read this book.
B008PZZD68|4.0|A very good science fiction movie, The movie give you incite about manifesting, what if people could easily manifest what they want. There are all sorts of books on that subject. There is a reason why we can't. Humans do not possess a controlled mind we are 99 percent monkey and 1 percent higher being.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's not very hard but it gets hard when you hit 30x multipier. The missions are good and the game is physically good. It also challenges your reflexes and mind :)
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like it because they make have that feeling Jake's gonna beat your high score but not quite.Thanks for an amazing game.The game is thrilling I did mot expect it to so flipping fun.I gotta say that it is like temple run but in a city or countries.But of course it is better:D
B0087JTAKW|2.0|I plugged along through at least 1/3 of the book.  I get that is has a message for all of us about time but it did not work for me.  Maybe if I finished it, I would have had a better  understanding and rating.
B009JZWWGC|4.0|A good Star Trek adventure. Good entertainment. A future I wish we were heading to but the signs don't look to good.
B0017SV1OI|5.0|I have been an Alan Parsons fan since the late 1070's.  I have all of their works on vinyl, and I can say they have all been played thousands of times over.  The Turn of A Friendly Card is my favorite from the group.  It is classic Alan Parsons and has the song &#34;Time&#34; in the set.  This album sticks with a theme, of course, just as they all do.  Alan Parsons Project were masters of the art of creating &#34;concept albums&#34;.  I recommend ALL of Alan Parsons Project albums.  They are each masterpieces in their own right.
B009RH9FR6|4.0|This is not some flimsy case. The leather seems to be of good quality and the whole unit is quite sturdy. I really enjoy having the option of using the stand either vertical or horizontal.
B000FA675C|5.0|I really loved this book.  Have read it more than once.  It made me really think about the background of Christianity.  THere are many stories and beliefs that were hidden by the &#34;powers that be&#34;. I know this is fiction, but who really knows the real truth?
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I wanted the authentic charger for my kindle keyboard and this one is it! Thank you very much! Works great!
B0079XPUOW|4.0|I think there is a great novel in this book somewhere and I found the codas better than the main story.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Who doesn't love a good game of solitaire! This app is great has ads but that's ok is free, works great no choice c closes so far
B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|Wanted to love the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" movies but found them interminable. Avoid \\"The Hobbit\\" as a consequence and because it's almost 3 hours long. However, it was available and I was bored one Saturday evening and rented the HD version and, I enjoyed it. I watched it 3 times during the 48-hour rental period.<br /><br />The cinematography is beautiful, the movie is more character-driven than I felt was LOTR and, while still drawn out, it kept me engaged. I'm writing a review of it which I almost never do.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I enjoy this game very much, keeps my mind and eyes co-ordinated.I can play it between jobs I have going
B005WUHAX8|1.0|This case didn't hold up well at all, broker within the first month. It is not easy when plugging in
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|I enjoyed the hunt for tools in part one, then the puzzles in part two. This one is offbeat and only slightly challenging. But great fun nevertheless. Even unique. Good job.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is very fun I love it. it starts out easy then gets harder. its a wonderful game everybody should get it
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Allan Karlsson was a kick to get to know!  What a life he lead!  Jonasson's wit and imagination kept this story moving along happily.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Amazon has a tremendous customer service!! The accessories works well with my kindle fire!! I love using my kindle, totally pleased with the service!!!
B0067R0APK|4.0|I gave AccuWeather Platinum a try and it is excellent.<br />My motivation for this APP was to check the weather here and other places around the US.<br />It works well is easy to use and does it all.<br />On getting started with it I noticed that information was constantly available.<br />Apparently it is running in the background keeping things up to date.<br />I had to uninstall it as I can't use up bytes that fast.<br />I have only a limited amount of data available per month. That is part of living in a rural area.<br />I cannot think of many negative comments as it is done very well.<br />One area that I could do without is the news and video clips of things that I have no interest in.<br />Stay with the weather and it does a good job - wish I could keep it.
B000HKYNQ0|5.0|Brought back many memories.  Even caught a few episodes I had either forgotten about or never saw in re-runs.  5 stars
1250027624|5.0|I have loved the series on TV and love the lushness of this book.  It is a good read about the current series but also about the history of the era.  Very beautifully illustrated. The photography is exceptional!  Love the actors which are highlighted.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway serfer is one of the funest game I have ever plaied. It gives you etvaneges for your runs. I love the.  opstcules.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|My addiction continues. I became infatuated with Game of Thrones via the TV series ... great acting, sweeping story. I decided to start reading the books while on beach holiday. Couldn't put the (e)book down. Now I've just downloaded the the fourth in the series. The TV programs do the books justice, but I enjoy the written saga even more. I'll suffer withdrawal when I finish the whole series.
B0086700CM|5.0|Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! fun and more. great game. need number 2. amazing. me and my younger brothers love it.<br /><br />  -Get This App
B00910Y1OQ|2.0|The hints won't turn off, so if I go a second without making a move the tiles it wants me to select start blinking.  I've turned hints on and off several times, it doesn't make a difference.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Not many books have captivated me like this series did...I find myself wondering...what now? This was one of the most intense and riveting stories I've read....highly recommended!
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|This is a great game, once you start it is hard to quit, I enjoy every minute of play and haven't been disappointed yet<br />.
B000I5SY5U|5.0|This show is a timeless classic.  It's nearly impossible to not sing and dance along.  This is the show that made Liza an icon!
B000FA675C|5.0|I got totally caught up in it the first time I read it. Could not put it down. Was recommended by my sister and did not let me down. Have since read this book 5 more times. Loved it!
B0041KVW2K|5.0|bought this 6 month ago ,,,after listening to all lp&#34;s,,<br />greeaaatt product with a even greater sound  very recommended :))
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Like a splash of cold water, this book will remain with me for a while and I think I will take my watch off today.  The Time Keeper is a book for everyone but especially to those who are clock watchers.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is an entertaining app for all ages.And of course the giant coin ,it's awesome.I'm getting use to  to this game a lot.When you realize that how fun it is, you're going to it.Great prizes and what.
B0073COMUW|4.0|Daylight color is very bright, very blue.  We will be using this in a different location than planned and order a cool white color.  Love the light, just not in the original location. Also, the description said &#34;Samsung,&#34; a good name in electronics.  The product didn't have &#34;Samsung&#34; anywhere on the box or the bulb leading me to think that this is false advertising.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I am addicted to this game I logged onto Facebook to play a friend's and now we have competions I highly recommend this to people of any age!! It's brilliant absolutely brilliant I only have one problem when the world tour moves country mine stays the same so I have to delete it and 're-install the game again losing all my progress. Other than that it is an amazing game!! =)
B002M5E2DW|5.0|Excellent would recommend this to others to read.  Also recommend the movie.  It follows the book very closely.  Great gift.
B004G600A4|5.0|An hilarious and beautifully done Disney movie. Great comedy, beautiful artistry (songs not as catch as Beauty & the Beast or The Little Mermaid). The horse and the chameleon make the whole thing worth it and they don't even speak!
B00873GRU4|5.0|Compelling, deep, great character building and sense of trepidation, fear, expectation the author develops. A plausible world and scenario leaving reader asking so many questions, just like the characters.
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|Super funny!! I love it! I have all the scary movies! I cant wait till number 5comes out! I will alwaysbe addicted
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|If you read the book and saw that they left so much out, though the movie runs over 2 hours, you may not think it is a 5 star movie. So much happens in the book that they just have to cut out.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|I love this show. I received my purchase quickly and intact.  I watched all episodes within a couple of days and was not disappointed!
B00B69UQEO|1.0|Depeche Mode has essentially run out of ideas since Songs of Faith and Devotion. Here, in Delta Machine, we have a mere rehash of their usual themes, viz lust and sin, redemption and temptation etc, without the tunes. Surely we could do better than to have a bunch of millionaires singing about their Little Universe and the Child Inside. The adjective for the former title says it all. For all the money in the world, this is all they can come up with. Sure, there are some interesting ideas from Ben Hillier et al, but mostly the songs go nowhere.<br /><br />Music for the masses, indeed.
B008VBYN80|4.0|This is a very good game I have tried to find a good game like this before and when I found it I was so happy the only downside to it is that there is adds every time you go on the game. But besides that I was very happy to find this game:)
B001I8A76A|5.0|My Kids love Pink and her voice has power and a great tone. some songs I had to not let the kids have but it was good I review music before letting the loose.
B00AB0Z88S|1.0|the product is useless for us as It can not be played on our sony psp3 in india jalaj joshi
B00B99KJR0|4.0|It will take up all your spare time!!! Totally addictive!! I can't put it down. Absolutely love it!! I play it on my kindle.
B008OOYALE|4.0|This game is a lot of fun to play. I play it all the time, but after awhile it gets too expensive to play with having to buy the gold since I've had the game the gold has been on sale once or twice and I wish it was on sale more.  I think u would find a lot more people playing if it was.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|it's really an epic sequel....maybe it's just cause i'm 34 .... but i would be gobsmacked if anyone my age did not relate to and find this movie hilarious. I love Judd Apato
055357342X|5.0|Looking forward to the paperback of #5.  This storyteller has me hooked.  I can feel the characters, and all the complexities of his environment.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|DR Who is one of the best science fiction shows of all time in my opinion. There has not been an episode that I have not liked.<br />I cant say anything negative about the doctor. All these shows are awesome !
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this game and so does my three year old daughter. I have to help her a Lil but I don't mind.
B004TTHLBE|5.0|This is one of the most highly inventive and fun novels I have read in a long time.  It is rare that, while reading a book, I don't look up its history or plot while reading it.  Often I do these things because I am fascinated by the book and I want to know more, but with Gaiman's book, I really wanted to be surprised.  I know that this is a normal frame of mind for most people but spoilers have never really bothered me but with &#34;American Gods,&#34; it did.  For once, I didn't want to know what happened, I wanted Gaiman's story to unfold before me and it turned out to be amazing.  I had read a couple Gaiman books before this and, while I liked them, they were never more than a 'like' but with this book I fell in love with Gaiman.  I cannot express how much I really loved this work but I have recommend it to a number of friends since and they all have come to my same conclusion.  I don't want to over-hype the book but I did love the book and I count it amongst my favorites.  I hope my review will persuade you to as well.
B008GBCMHO|5.0|My personal favorite Disney movie. One of the oldest but still one of the best. Fun from the beginning to end!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|at my school teaches have ipads and after math class r math  teacher lets play games on his ipad and this is the number 1 game that we want 2 play
030758836X|3.0|I'm glad I borrowed the book from the library instead of paying for it. This isn't a book I would ever re-read or recommend to anyone. The leading characters are unpleasant and have no redeeming or likeable characteristics. I am wondering if unlikeable characters are a new trend. Unusual plot, murder or is it? Disappointing ending.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|A story line that is interesting.  Actors are outstanding in their roles. I particularly like historical pieces especially the social manners shown!
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|I do not like this game at all. You are forced to go on line or you can't play the game.I don't want to play with others.So I give give this game a total thumbs down
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is one of the few games that is fun all the time, but updates enough to keep me from growing boards.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|fun but a little confusing on figuring out how everything works.  overall my 5year old and i have fun with the horses together.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Now the wait begins for book 6.  I will be stuck in the seven kingdoms until then.  George R. R. Martin rocks.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Loved it from start finish, will keep this book do future reference. A must read for every gardener of flowers..
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! There isn't anything I would change accept give more bingo coins faster then every 24 hrs.
006114665X|5.0|A truly magisterial work of almost unbelievable complexity (as is its subject, especially with all its Balkan dimensions).  A must read to understand the roles played by the deep seated phantasmagoria of a Great Serbia, the intricate cross-currents within each of the major governments, the inherent instability of the Austrian Empire (\\"The Empire Without Qualities\\" or \\"an egg with two yolks\\") and especially the rather startling portrait of Kaiser Wilhelm II who seems far les bellicose and far less in control of his own government and military at the critical junctures then previous accounts have claimed. Although it must still be said that the Kaiser's previous insistence upon a England-challenging sea empire and concomitant naval race changed the complexity of Europe rather dramatically.  But to Clark, he seems far less bent on war and not really wanting one. On Sunday, June 28, for example, he returns to Berlin \\"to take things in hand and preserve the peace of Europe. On July 30, he is aggravated ad shocked to learn that if Germany and France got involved, Britain would come into the war on their side, lamenting that his grandmother would never have allowed that! Also new to me was the blame properly ascribed to British Foreign Minister Edward Grey who seems to have been totally out of his depth as the countries inch ever onward to a tragic catastrophe amid a complex shift from a multi-polar world in 1882 to an essentially bipolar one in 1907, making the whole system \\"more opaque and unpredictable, feeding a mood of mutual distrust, even within the respective alliances.\\"  The Russians too, come out looking worse due to their insistence on early mobilization, forcing the German hand, as do Serbia and Austria, the two countries most bent on conflict. The author also insists that popular support for the war was far outweighed in virtually all countries by astonishment and chagrin that it was happening.  This is an outstanding work.
B0096CDG0O|1.0|This game hasn't given turn notifications for 2 months.  They say they are working it but it shouldn't take this long.  If nothing else they could provide updates.  They just want your money, as the notifications stop once you pay for the app.  This seems to be a prime example of greed in action.
1457514508|1.0|Please don't waste your time.  This book was so trite.  It was painful to read.  The characters were so unrealistic and impulsive.  I kept reading, hoping it would get better, and it never did.
B0031KE9C6|5.0|Logan Echolls. That is all. Veronica's spunk is contagious and makes you keep watching episode after episode. Finished this season in about two days.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|Tommy Lee Jones and John Goodman bring James Lee Burke to life on the screen. I wish Jones could turn this into a franchise. His gritty Cajun detective is much more watchable than Jason Bourne any day of the week.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|It was somewhat disturbing with the violence towards the animals but beyond that it was an amazing story and visually stunning.  wonderful acting by the actors who played Pi
B00C1BTWV4|5.0|The new theme park on a tiny island off Costa Rica contains deadly living biological attractions. Dinosaurs roam Jurassic Park. But there is much more to this film. Steven Spielberg's basic ideas are family values, illumination and flight, according to Douglas Brode, author of The Films of Steven Spielberg; and a film professor at Syracuse University. Before the park opens, one of the Velociraptors tries to escape its crate and kills one of the workers trying to contain it. The park's owner invites two scientists to his park, hoping they will endorse it so the park can open. His two grandchildren join the adults on a tour. The computer-controlled vehicles break down, the T-rex and the Velocipaptor are a no-show, and the Triceratops is ailing. A computer programmer, who hopes to steal the dinosaur embryos, deactivates most of the park's 10,000-volt electric fences. Soon, there is an uninvited guest on the tour - a Tyrannosaurus rex - and the children are in its sights. A deadly romp ensues. This film, first released in 1993, still thrills and has the in-your-face scare factor. (In my opinion, the original film is excellent. The 3D version released this month does not add anything to the original.)(review by Judy Berman)
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The story kept me spellbound right to the finish and I didn't want it to end. It was so well written and pleasing to read.
B0094LZY2A|5.0|Jumanji is a family favorite. My grandson loves and we can watch it on a rainy day and always enjoy it. The video quality is great.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|All I can say is wow.  Awesome book and impossible to put down.  Very detailed and takes you on a new adventure with each page.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I am an InfoSec guy first, IT guy second, just out of college. I've done two Cooperative Education experiences for a total of a year in the IT field, one as a Security Engineer and another as a Software Developer.<br /><br />This book got me excited, couldn't put it down. So much about it was ringing bells with the problems I saw in my brief time working these positions, and was applicable to college students (clubs and classwork) as well! I plan on sending this to my old bosses ASAP.<br /><br />A great read that really instills the key points in a fun and entertaining way!
B005YGCSRI|5.0|I recommend this to any fans of the Jurassic Park fans! Classic Jurassic Park logo on the front, imbossed and glossy steelbook! Comes complete with Digital Copy, DVD versions of the film as well as the Blu-Ray, great quality by the way! Only con about this in my opinion is that there isn't much artwork other than the front cover logo, nothing on back but black and no inside artwork.
B0092MKTL2|5.0|Just an amazing album that captures quite A few genres in my opinion.  Every song sounds like a different band with a different hit!  Just amazing me and my entire family love this!  Nothing dirty so the kids can listen all they want too!  Totally shocked because I bought the whole album for the songs Radioactive and It's Time. (Songs on the radio).  Had no idea!  Trying to find tour dates next!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Great book. Lots of twists & turns. I'm gonna miss the characters from this series. :(  Highly recommend this book!
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|lots of fun lots of levels needs a little better controls good with progress and power ups gets where you don't. really have too fight
B004HW7JI8|5.0|daughter loved it and is looking forward to season three. she spent quality time in her room enjoying her new tv love
B009JZWO3I|5.0|This television show transcends all other shows on tv today and yesterday. Can't wait to watch each episode. Absolutely love it!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Caught my attention from the first page. Keep notes on the characters, it can get confusing. Focuses on the children of book one main characters.
B00866H7SS|5.0|Well............  1st the main character Eva is one of my favourite female characters, she don't take any s*** from Gideon and tells him up front what she wants and expects an what she is, for example tell him that she is a jealous easily see no fluffing round .  2nd Gideon is dominant and needs control BUT U can literally feel the love and passion between them, most times out side the bedroom he treat her how she deserves.  3rd I like how she's wounded as well and they both on equal footing he can't use money against her  And last the supporting characters are the best
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I would rate this at 5 stars, if I could play it on my laptop.  But since I can only play it on my iphone and kindle, I will only give it 4 stars.  I do like it a lot, just hate the limited ability to play it anywhere.
B0064MGU98|5.0|This television show transcends all other shows on tv today and yesterday. Can't wait to watch each episode. Absolutely love it!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Awesome storylines , love the settings and characters.  This series has become an instant favorite and thanks to amazon prime I got to watch season 1 7
B000QEIORG|5.0|I wish this version was available when the cd was 1st released. Extra songs more than make this purchase justified...
B000IZA9NU|5.0|Great story, always fun to re-watch the old favorites. These movies should be archived as Gene Roddenbury was a man ahead of his time.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show just keeps getting better with every season. I'm already having withdrawal from it! Great acting and writing make this season so unforgettable.
B0012HEB32|3.0|The show is interesting. There is a lot going for it but unfortunately I think it is due to the setup from the movies. The writing of the tv show is actually really bad, the actors try to do their best but the sophmoric and stupid &#34;realities&#34; the writers create are so frustrating at times you just want to stop watching. Every character is two dimensional and they always do things they know better just to create tension. Also I got so tired of all the charcters ALWAYS against each other. You would think that because the end of the world is near they might set aside their stupid feelings and work to gether.They are always tough and trained exept when they need to be, they always figure things out except when they need to and the civilins always accept what is going on even when there is no evidence. Really annoying. Sarah's monologues are really bad and you just want to fast forward or turn the sound down. Basically, the writing is really bad. Could have been sooooo much better.
B003SPCYP8|4.0|Humungous expectations have preceded this movie and stars one of the biggest stars of the Indian Film Industry Shahrukh Khan who has thus far given two flops i.e. Billu Barber and Dulha Mil Gaya, although they were not considered to be noteworthy to begin with.<br />Karan Johar who began his career with Kuch Kuch Hota Hai has started to venture in to serious cinema territory with Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna has also tried to maintain this stance with his production house producing diverse fares such as Dostana and Wake up Sid.<br />Even before the release this movie was in the hot water with the Shiv Sena, a right wing party prevented its release because of statements made by Shahrukh about some Pakistani cricket players.<br />The foray of Fox Search Light pictures in Bollywood with the payment of an obscene amount of rupees for the rights, they hope to have a successful launch where Sony stumbled with Saawariya.<br />How does this all bode with MNIK?<br />MNIK is the story of Rizvaan Khan who suffers from Aspergers and has the inability to deal with social situations and interactions. He migrates to America after his brother sponsors him and starts working as a cosmetics salesman. He meets Kajol, a single mother who works in a salon and falls in love. His brother protests his decision to marry her but they do and start a small business together. Their domestic bliss is interrupted until 9/11. Life takes a tragic turn and Mandira accuses Rizvan and his faith for the tragedy. They separate and Rizvaan embarks on a journey that will bring back Mandira and clear conceptions about his name and religion.<br />The movie showcases the finest talents India has to offer and Shahrukh delivers his best performance to date in recent years after Chak De. Any doubts that one had about his acting ability are permanently erased. Acting as a person with Autism, he is simply superb and has all the gestures and mannerisms to a T, I know this because I work with Autistic children. His acting makes you smile, watch the scene when Kajol asks him to marry him or the scene when he is interrogated at the airport. In fact in every scene there is a nuance that deserves a second viewing. Hopefully we will be able to see more of Rizvaan and less of Raj in the future.I cannot wait for the DVD to see the brilliant scenes individually.<br />Kajol is simply superb, and makes a grand re entry. She plays the role of the supporting wife, and devasted mother with deftness. The chemistry of Shahrukh and Kajol is simply electric.<br />Karan Johar's direction and Shibhani Bhatija's script is marvelous. Ravi Chandrans cinematography captures the American landscape remarkably well. Shankar - Ehsaan and Loy have complemented the movie with great music. My personal favorites are Sajdaa and Noor E Khuda. The only drawback that I can find would be Deepa Bhatia's editing, the second half could have been a little shorter and less preachy because it attempts to make Rizvaan in to a some sort of an icon.<br />On the whole, My name is Khan is a great movie. I give it four stars because in my opinion the first half deserves 5 stars while the second half deserves 3 because things get a bit lengthy. Watch this movie now. Four stars 12/18/10<br />Post Script: If you have seen the movie and found it too long, the American version is being readied for release and it is supposedly about 35 minutes shorter. Dharma Productions have recruited the services of Alan Edward Bell, director of 500 Days of Summer and will be released on the 7th of May with subtitles and voiceovers in English.makes you smile, watch the scene when Kajol asks him to marry him or the scene when he is interrogated at the airport.

B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I love that they pick a female to be the hero of the movie. Even my son enjoyed it alot. I would like to see more movies that can show a girl can do what she sets her mind to do.

1439156816|5.0|Many people suspect that Stephen King -- author of 52,304 books -- is actually an outsourced writing team in Bangalore working for 10 dollars a day and all the mango lassis they can drink. This blunt, brilliant and sometimes bombastic memoir has the uniquely personal voice and content to prove -- beyond a doubt! -- that the man exists and has done the massive work attributed to him.<br /><br />Now for a few short sentences and I'll quit: King tells his own story of struggling toward success -- the agony, missteps, doubts and ultimate triumph. He writes just as one would expect -- with a driving, highly opinionated confidence. He gives advice for writers, tells how he works, where he works, when he works, why he works. Along the way any reader who wants to learn about writing -- for whatever reason (to write, to teach, to unpack the secrets of talent) -- will be delighted with this brash testimonial of a life of toiling at a desk for the delight of millions.
B00992CF6W|4.0|WE are a minecraft family we love this edition, I would recommend it to everyone! very cool graphics and sounds
1401937519|5.0|I have been intrigued by this book since seeing the author on FOX News. I have been too busy to read much of it yet, but I can tell I am going to love it. True stories with happy endings are the greatest!
B005MSD6QU|5.0|This show just gets better and better. I'd recommend this to just about anyone! The background stories intrigue me just as much as the &#34;cases&#34;!
B002DQLGHU|1.0|Sadly we only saw about 20 minutes before the item started freezing! We restarted it multiple times and tried everything, just didn't play.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|It was so easy to use and gave me all the information I needed when looking up a word I hadn't heard of.
B003O86FMW|3.0|The story was not as well written as the first book.  I do not feel that the character Katniss was portrayed as well as on the first book.  If she was portrayed in this same light I do believe there would have been a trilogy
B000I9TY4G|5.0|You know those movies that become your favorites very quickly? This is one for me. I've watched this movie more time than I can count and I still love watching it over again. I'll do a full day Firefly marathon and end with Serenity sometimes. From beginning to end, by far one of the best movies out there. *Stay Shiny!*
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I read this book in two days...couldn't put it down. Beautiful story and very inspiring. I have recommended it to several people.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great app.  It really gets your mind working.  Fun for adults and kids alike.  A must download.  Best part....it's FREE
0061122092|4.0|Sweet yet profound, as are all Coelho's works. Short and sweet—Still packs a punch.  This a journey story. In more ways than one. A journey of the heart, a journey for lost faith, as well as the physical journey through villages, across mountains seeking that eternal *something*.<br /><br />This is not my absolute favorite book off the tree that keeps leafing out, as Paulo Coelho expands his visionary ministry into the mysteries of faith, the spirit-world, and the longing of the heart. But it fits in nicely and I'm not sorry I read it. 
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Best TV created.  Love, love, love.  Acting is superb.  Can't wait for 4th season.  The bar has been set for television.
B000YJ54DU|5.0|I love the way he handles situration that the law doesn't do anything about.There should be a real Jack Reacher.
044024613X|5.0|Many different aspects of this book were intriguing.  From the question of guilt, to how the parents handled the evidence and trial. Many talking points, but to mention them would give away the book and ending!
0061122416|5.0|Awesome journey story. Mystical, spiritual, profound—all these trite words and more describe this work of Paulo Coelho.<br /><br />This book was his break out of obscurity sending his message, and what a message, to the world.<br /><br />Highly recommended to all readers—everywhere. This is one you need to experience for yourself. 
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Good diversity of backgrounds.  Many levels and games to keep it interesting.  Some levels quite challenging.  Keep bringing out new varitities.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|4.5 stars.  fun.  good graphics  fast moving.  i would highly recommend it.  keeps your interest.  it is fun to play
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book is a page turner in the beginning. About 75% through the book, it kinda fizzles. It is a good read and the description of Christian.....whewww[...] I was a little disappointed at the ending......it definitely make me want to continue the series.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|This just keeps getting better. They have stayed true to the story and haven't tried to go off into some wild new direction. I can't wait for the next season.
B00AO686MY|1.0|The DVD in this combo set is exactly the same DVD 1 that was included in the earlier DVD release. It has a menu selection called Valiant Office, which is the set up for sound and subtitles. The interactive feature called The Valiant Files was on DVD 2 of that set. The blu ray version does not have the Valiant Files on it. Whoever threw this crappy combo set together didn't even bother to notice!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Absolutely holds me at the edge of my seat...the acting and writing are outstanding for every intriquing character. Thank you PBS, please keep series going.

B00BBW16HW|5.0|Heart felt and moving film based on a true story. Well worth an evenings rental. A must see film for the family.
B00BCOQSSQ|4.0|In a classic R.R. Tolkien fashion Roy Huff's book \\"The First Pillar\\" spins an imaginative tale with qualities of steadfast friendship, self-sacrifice and commitment woven in. And it begins with Owen Sage being swept into Everville,a small town that exists between here and there in time and space and into the workshop of a wizard called the Keeper. Here he's given the task of finding a way to fix a breach that will not only bring evil into Everville but other worlds including his own. Juxtaposed against Everville in this story is Owen's reality, his New England school, Easton Falls, where he's enrolled with his friends Anika and Dante. It is these two friends that will assist him as he trains to harness his thoughts and emotions before a battle that will ultimately determine the fate of all the worlds. Woven into Owen's story is the tale of Carwyn, the Fron, whose destiny and self-sacrifice results in the healing of the first breach.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed \\"The First Pillar\\" with all its unusual creatures like Dalga, the hairy marmook and the Fron,a race that's short, hairless, with tiny eyes, a keen sense of hearing and large ears. Even Them, the archenemy of the Fron and the Other In Between are imaginative creations.<br />My only criticism which does not take anything away from this wonderful fantasy is the age of its characters. In my reading I felt Owen and his friends were not much older than fourteen or fifteen, high-school students, and that the book was geared to a pre-teen to younger teen group. I was surprised that they were eighteen and freshman. However, I do recommend this book and can't wait to read the next book in the series
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|ANY JEWEL QUEST GAME IS FUN. I PUT THIS IN MY COLLECTION. THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST ONE YET, AND A LOT OF FUN.

B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was not what I expected!  It was more of a psychological insight into people's minds!  What an ending,
B005LAIHY0|4.0|I thorough enjoyed the movie.  I'm an Alien movie series fan, and Prometheus definitely delivered; it provided a very creative vision of how the Aliens evolved.
B001TODCII|5.0|great movie action and nice and clear  love the movie great flick love it especially when he goes look for his kid
B00B2V66VS|1.0|It;s just not my kind of game. It might be fine oas a computer game, but not as a phone game. I am deleting it.

145162607X|5.0|I NEVER REVIEW BUT I HAD TO REVIEW THE KINGMAKER'S DAUGHTER! AMAZING!!<br />If you had to read only one book from Philippa Gregory's collection of work then read The Kingmaker's Daughter!<br />The story has an original and  more reaistic view point  of Richard the third's wife Anne.<br />It is more honest with the reader than any other of Philippa's books! Unlike *cough* The white queen*cough*<br />This is the only book she has written so far that I'd RECOMEND. It opened up a whole new world of interest and understanding for me<br />It is easy to connect with the characters and feel for them. Skip the White Queen, read a bit of the Red Queen if you like BUT YOU MUST READ The Kingmaker's Daughter before ANY other books in this series.<br />Enjoy and good reads :)
B006WQLH7G|5.0|Great for keeping you safe online, does a good job<br />scanning the pages and making sure to update it often, It works great!

0375842209|5.0|The first few pages had me confused....death, talking about colors...I was wondering where this book was going.  I could not put this book down.  It only happens occasionally that you find a book that you never want to end.  I loved the characters and wish Mr. Zusak would write a sequel.  If you love the 40's, if you love history and if you love sentiment, this book is for you.

B003TSEL7S|5.0|A fantastic series for all to read. Whether a child, teen, young adult or senior you will thoroughly enjoy all of Rick Riordans series.
B002NXOQF2|5.0|As a sixty-something reader with a sizable library in my home, I consider Watership Down one of my favorite books of all time.  I am very satisfied to have this wonderful story in my electronic library to read and reread on my tablet.  5 star rating!!
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|It's the Hobbit.  Who didn't love this movie.  Can't wait until the next movie in the thriology is made. Hmm...
B005DJREGQ|3.0|It's ok but as a parent not something I would share with my teenager.  A bit too much drinking and sex.  Yeh, I know it happens.
B00280LYIM|5.0|What can you say?! Another masterpiece from Rick Riordan. Each book is better and better.. A series that can be read and reread.
B000P46QTA|5.0|This is a frightening view of the days surrounding the demise of the Berlin Wall. It is perhaps the most redemptive movie I've ever watched. At the top of my personal Top Ten list.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I only wish I had cable so I could be watching season three.  Got hooked on the series during deployment.
B003Y5H54W|3.0|they tried with the red riding hood took a vague story and at the last moment threw in red riding hood. not much of a love story sorta one way. special effects are just ok. set was descent but very small so its hard to screw that up. my guess is this was low budget film because of the uninteresting story line
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Love it LOve it Love it! I use this app all the time. Lets me watch videos and old TV programs, interviews and other things when weather or delays have me stopped in one place for a while.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|And I think I prefer the original!  Both games are addictive; really enjoy the challenge!  Even my husband enjoys it and he's not a &#34;games&#34; person!!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Loved this movie in the theater so I just had to buy it.  I had a dear friend who introduced LesMiserables to me years ago but I never had the opportunity to watch a good version of story.  I love all the actors!  They did a fabulous job.
B004EPYZPS|4.0|they made one mistake the movie shows the creature running about but when it actually happened the film ran out then the creature escaped. u dont get to see much of it until the end. this is a father/son daughter/father son likes her they are dead center in a wicked train accident government cover up. but it does move along pretty good one of those movies id watch a second or third time. worth buying
B00280LYHS|5.0|Can not wait for the next Rick Riordan book to be released. I read, reread and read again. Just can't get enough of Percy Jackson, the Olympians or the Kanes.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|It's Firefly, who doesn't love it? I never liked cowboy themed anything but add space and I'm sold. My demands are small.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I love when a book leaves me teary and thoroughly satisfied.  Matthew Quick created such three dimensional characters, and deals with the subject of mental illness sensitively and with a deft hand .<br /><br />I have not seen the movie, so I was happy to read this unaided by the movie version.  What a great story - full of hope! I highly recommend.
0316226424|1.0|WARNING - SPOILERS (but is there anyone out there at this point who would be reading this that doesn't know what happens?)<br /><br />I read all four of the Twilight books, mostly because they were so popular and I wanted to see what all the fuss was about.  I liked the first one.  Sure it was a fluffy and completely unrealistic teenage love story (and poorly written to boot), but I was drawn in by the story and the characters (well, all the characters except for Bella).  My interest in the story waned as the books went on, particularly when the love triangle aspect was brought into it. But I read on, interested to see how the series wrapped itself up.<br /><br />Breaking Dawn is, by far, one of the worst books I have ever read.  While I was reading it (and especially at the end), I just kept thinking to myself this had to be a very bad joke - and the real book was still out there somewhere.<br /><br />Bella has never been a character I could root for(sullen, whiny and having no personality or interests unless it relates to a man), but she is completely ridiculous in this book.  She complains about having to marry the man of her dreams (who she is apparently willing to give up her life and become a vampire for - but marrying him is a crazy proposal).  Complains about her life while zipping around in her expensive car.  Complains Edward wants to her *gasp* go to college.  Whine, whine, whine.<br /><br />The plot line about Bella becoming pregnant is simply ridiculous.  Even in fantasy novels, there needs to be realism as it relates to the world in the book.  There is simply no way she could have become pregnant (and no way for her to even have sex with Edward in the first place, but whatever).  Given her personality for the first three books, her being so determined to give birth to this creature no matter if it kills her doesn't ring true.  Bella, who faints at the site of blood, now sits around drinking it?  Uh huh.<br /><br />Oh, and I almost forgot - Edward suggests to Bella that she abort his spawn and try to get pregnant by Jacob instead if she really wants a baby.  Because he just wants her to be happy you know.  WTF?????<br /><br />The birth scene is something else.  All sex scenes just fade to black (because that is too gratuitous to write about I guess), but graphic birth scenes where monster babies eat their way out of their mother is A-OK.  Three books worth of imagining how Bella gets turned into a vampire, and this is what we get?  Edward just biting her would have been far better.<br /><br />Then, for the first three books, all we hear about is how terrible and horrible being a vampire is.  How you give up your life, family and everyone you ever knew.  How you are insatiably thirsty and completely out of control for years.  How all vampires just wish they could have their human lives and souls back. But none of this is a problem for Bella.  She's the most capable and perfect vampire that ever was - she has no desire to eat any humans.  She can control herself right off the bat.  Doesn't even want to eat her new half-human spawn or her dad.  Oh, that's another thing that conveniently Bella doesn't need to worry about, losing her family.  Her dad just unilaterally decides there is nothing unusual about his daughter's new life and change in appearance.  And nothing strange about her baby having teeth and rapidly growing at an inhuman rate.  Nothing at all.  He just goes and watches football and says he's just on a \\"need to know\\" basis.  Yeah, that's exactly how a normal father would react.  As for Bella's mother - who knows.  She just disappears.  She's too busy traveling or something to come see her new grandchild.  Convenient way to not have to try and explain yet another human parent who doesn't give a crap that something is very off with her daughter and grandchild.<br /><br />Also, all the vampires are rich, beautiful and can do anything and everything they want (travel, etc.) and live forever happily ever after.  Why exactly is this such a horrific existence again?<br /><br />Side note - Renesmee is one of the worst made up names ever.  But I can guarantee there will be people naming actual babies this terrible name.<br /><br />But by far, the worst part of this book is the lunacy called pedophilia . . . oops I mean \\"imprinting.\\"  One minute, Jacob is inexplicably in love with Bella.  But the next minute, he's in love with her infant daughter?  And everyone thinks this is just great?  Even Edward, the infant's father?  At one point, he even refers to Jacob as \\"son.\\"  Disgusting.  I don't care how fans try to explain this travesty of a plot line away - \\"Oh, he's just her protector until she's of age.\\"  It's creepy, untrue to the characters and just plain wrong.  I'm sorry but there is nothing romantic about a 17-year-old (or however old Jacob is supposed to be) having those kinds of feelings for a little girl.  Whether he acts on them or not.<br /><br />And then we come to the final scene.  The battle.  The climax of the entire novel.  And they . . . talk.  And Bella shows the big bad Volturi her special talent, her \\"love shield\\" (gag me) and the Volturi just turn tail and go home.  I actually laughed.<br /><br />I'm sorry I ever wasted my time reading this drivel (and this book has completely ruined the original Twilight story).  I guess it was just so bad, I kept reading to see what ridiculous thing would happen next.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I have read this series over and over and enjoy them more each time. A great series that takes the reader to places you may never get to in life but can travel there in your mind.  Will recommend to everyone and have.
B0015O5XUM|5.0|I was never a Van Morrison fan. Lately I've listened to a few old recordings and became hooked. Great additon to my CD library.
B008BGNMZU|3.0|I was disappointed in this album and I will be more careful before I purchase another Fourplay album even though I have several already.
B007REV4YI|5.0|This looks so much better than the theater. My theatrical release was over gamma'd.<br />I can correct on my TV, but who wants to have a special mode for one movie.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Love these Rick Riordan books. Read this one in one week. Cant wait for the next in the series to be released.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Reading all three books in order give a real sense of the story. I also watched all three Swedish movies in order. Much better than the American version. Once you read them the moviesmake great sencse and keep you on the edge of your seat. (Even sub-titled)
B008VO3PA4|5.0|This is a cute and funny book full of poems written from a cat's view of what life is like for them.
B00APJLX8E|5.0|It's for kids, it's okay for adults. If you wondered where Dracula might have picked up after Scooby Doo and the Reluctant Werewolf, this was probably it.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Another brilliant adventure from Rick Riordan. I love all of his series and eagerly await for more to be released.
B004H1U2HE|5.0|Wonderful writing. A unique, amazing and moving perspective on the Zionism, the creation of the state of Israel and the day to day life of these pioneers who came from all over the world to Israel to fulfill their dreams or just find an ideal.
B005KJJ4F8|4.0|Was different then what I expected which turned out to be very good. I am looking forward to the next in the series.
B008RC72G8|5.0|Yes, this is a cool movie on it's own.<br /><br />It's not a Dark Shadow's fan's dream though. the same actors could have done other things, and Depp could have chosen to be a director, gone very dark and creepy, gotten Jeremy Irons to play Barnabas, even with the rest of the cast the same, things could have been a horror masterpiece.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|As with the rest of the series keeps you wanting more. Cant wait to get the next in the series.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Watch it you'll love it.  I cannot wait for season 4 to come out fall of 2013.  A must watch show!!!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This book was as good as the first ones in the series, which were all excellent. I am looking forward to the next one.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I found this to be one of John Grisham’s best mysteries.  The book is full of twists and turns and a surprising ending.  Well worth the read!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I have recommended this series to many people. I enjoy the books so much more that the series. A series that takes you away from reality and gives you a great journey into fantasy.
B003TH14H4|5.0|Love the flirtation and the mystery.  Each ending usually takes me off guard.  Loved it and very glad I purchased it!  It's worth the price.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Wow this was a very mysterious mysterious book I loved it I totally recommend you should read this book I can't wait to red the next one.I didn't like the auto read.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|I was disappointed in the blasphemy in this video!  To assume that Lincoln would use that language is uncalled for and presumptuous.  What a waste of a good movie!  I will never watch again.  GD was used 13 x's.  Why?  I am ashamed of watching and I would to tell you to stay away if you do not want to hear the cursing. The back of the movie said BRIEF strong language....give me a break.
B004UUKDNA|4.0|Good, catchy, smart, non-profanity laced music.  Great for long and short road trips.  Imaginative and fresh.  I enjoyed it very much.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Can't wait to see each episode.  I'm not one who enjoys watching something a second time but I do with this series.  Each ending has a twist.  Enjoying the evolution of the Castle-Beckett relationship.
B001DM1VXE|2.0|Good acting, artistically crafted. Suspenseful. But what a bunch of hokum. Computers oozing goo, special numbers to unlock the Torah. A low budget Da Vinci code.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Though the people did not look like they were starving, the acting was good. This is the second time l have seen this picture and l would say &#34;thanks enough&#34;.
1419707671|4.0|my 7 year old son laughed and giggled his way through the entire series. My 5 year old daughter has started reading them as well. I was thrilled to hear Book 8 will be out in the fall.
B000KZBRG6|5.0|This is a sweet little meter that does an excellent job and isn't as expensive or complicated as some of this brand's digital monsters.  So far I've tested it against the light meters of a couple of my cameras and in average, not overly bright, lighting it delivers excellent results.  I haven't carried a light meter with me since I was in high school (back in the mid 70's) but this unit is small enough that I can hang it around my neck on the generous included lanyard and not even know it's there.  I highly recommend this meter to anyone, student to advance shooter who wants to simplify.
B0064MGU98|5.0|A wholly addictive series. Juliana Margulies is an unusual actress, wistful and very adept at developing the character from a lost soul to an increasingly competent and strong woman wending her way between her basic decency and the sometimes questionable ethics of the legal and political world. Archie Panjabi, though, who plays Kalinda is the most compelling character in a TV series even though the character's ability to instantly perform impossible missions is often less than believable.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|it keeps you wanting more!  every episope has its own twist, while following each characters life.  very good show my husband and i are hooked!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|The novel included a great story line and character development.  The &#34;journal&#34; style of writing does lend itself to some pretty elementary writing style, which you may or may not like.
B009R659L8|5.0|Thrilling right to the end with a surprising ending . She did it again keep the readers on the edge till the end
B000FA675C|5.0|Enjoyed it as much as the movie.  I forgot that there were a few diferences, but not worth mentioning.  enjoy.
B004TI5N38|4.0|A very good read. Well written and cohesive. Like Baldacci's new hero a lot. Like Lee Child's Reacher, Puller will get justice for all wrong doing. I also like the way he works within the system to get the job done. Glad I bought this from Amazon and read this book. I've already recommended it to several people.
B000FA675C|4.0|Non-stop action, but filled with illogic, made-up history, absurd and amateurish interpretations of actual history, and ignorance (willful or not) of geography. Still, an entertaining ride. Buy it used, not new.
B005HSG3TC|3.0|Third type of cover I have purchased.  The stretch band is beginning to stretch out and the case seems flimsy although the case has been durable and functions.  I bought my wife a leather cover with a magnetic clasp which seems more protective and more durable.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love the show.  I can hardly wait for season 3.  It is truly addictive.  Not English stuffy at all.
B007D2XSW0|2.0|I can't even use my pics from Facebook on this app every time I click use pics from Facebook it never loads and I can only use my pics from my gallery
1416550550|3.0|This book had a lot going on (too much)<br />- 4 generations of a family spanning over 100 years<br />- constant jumping between the time periods ( I ended up keeping a sheet of notes for each time period, it was so confusing)<br />- many dark themes: mental illness (by the end I wondered if anyone in this book was sane!), betrayal, abandonment, poverty, on and on...<br />- On the positive side, it was not a hard book to read, and the characters were pretty well developed<br /><br />Bottom line: too long, confusing, and could have benefited from more focus and some editing.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Such a great read can't wait to read the next book now!!!!! Can't wait to see what happens next !!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Had been waiting to get this book.  WHY did I wait?  It's fast moving with twists and turns.  Just the kind of book I like.  I love it when the author has yet another trick up their sleeve when I think I have figured it out.  Great book!
B00722ZHG6|5.0|This is a great album. The songs truly compliment her soothing yet powerful voice. She is truly talented. If your looking for a new fresh non taboo artist, Birdy is the one!
B008NCSZQ8|1.0|Making it available to buy only - no rent option?!?  I hate you Hollywood. Seriously. Why they gotta be such jerks?
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a book I could read over an  over. It is raw and sexual with a story line to keep a reader addicted.
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|We are so disappointed with this movie! We absolutely loved knocked up, one of our favorite movies, and this one fell way short!  It almost seems like it was trying to hard to be funny, never really got us to laugh!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I play this game everyday. I love this game so much.you have to play this game. Get this game now
B006MW3UZW|4.0|The Crawleys are back for the second season of Downton.  Generally, I'm obsessed with this extremely well-made, well-written show.  That being said, the second season is a bit over-the-top compared to the first.  While the first season was better, I still watched the second season with fervor and relish.  I can't wait for season three to be available on prime instant video!
B000FCKGPC|4.0|I heard multiple negative views on this book and wasn't pumped about reading this book. Not as great as the previous books in th  series but a worthwhile read. Focused on several characters I didn't care about but proved interesting.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Absolutely loved the movie, and for one of the first times ever I like the movie more than the book!  The book was good, I love the humor - kind of sarcastic which is my humor - And I love how everything is described by a Pat and his thought process.<br /><br />Overall a great read, and don't miss the movie :-)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game ever for me you should try it it's amazing if you don't try you're just missing out in all the fun try it lets see what you think
B000002ITW|5.0|i liked new music not on lp good selection of songs not on original and great recording was really nice
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I don't use this app, but the person I got it for loves it...would recommend to everyone, it's very interesting
B00BIRRDZ4|5.0|The songwriting is so amazing and says so much!  The singing and guitar playing rifts are awesome.  It is the total package.  They are going to be &#34;knocking the socks&#34; off the Dylan tour!  It is just amazing....
B0064MPXFA|5.0|The legal system appears very real, even though it is fictional. The interplay of the family and professional lives of the lawyers reminds me of the complexity of the human situation, and that lawyers, even though Shakespeare suggests that we kill them all, are human beings caught daily in the beehive of right, wrong, fairness,  money, and human frailty.
B00ATP24SW|5.0|awesome  increased my workouts by 10% while listening<br />love the level of intensity  really glad i found this band<br />thanks<br />steve in<br />dallas
B0063GORYU|5.0|I am hooked.  I get to win some and lose some. Playing as I  have the time.  Great app. Addictive and fun.  5 stars.
0316044695|5.0|Wonderful story and the end really brought tears to my eyes.  These men go through so much.  My hats off to them all.  I'm just starting the Overton Window so I'll comment on that when I've finished reading it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|great show Just started watching and I am now hooked. I would recommend this to anyone it is a good story line
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|There's only been 2 books in my life that have made me feel what this book does. I recommend it.... It's an emotional rollercoaster.
B008RA3X5E|2.0|It is certainly a pretty alarm clock but I find that the standard alarm sounds are not loud enough to wake me up on my Kindle fire (and I'm a light sleeper). Also, there are lots of ads even in the paid version.<br /><br />I am investigating the volume problem but I'm getting pretty tired of Amazon's revenue model: pay a small price for an app. If you don't like it, that is too bad but you have not lost much money.<br /><br />Suggestions: Make alternate alarm sounds available for download, not just music. Really, really, really work on the volume problem.<br /><br />Some may find the user interface intuitive - I don't.
B00C32R64G|5.0|Great album to continue the saga of Volbeat and the Young the Giant cover is super cool. Definitely worth buying
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I've read the books so I came in with a preconcieved notion of how the movies should look. My vision and that of the film's creators weren't really in sync, but all in all it was a pretty good movie. *It's not a hundred percent true to the books, but they did a pretty good job overall. I still prefer the books over the movie, but the movie isn't bad.
B0068RHGJM|5.0|I love everything about this cd, these guys are awesome, ive never seen em live, which i hope to one day. But as long as they keep putting them out, ill keep buying em,.
B001DUDKEY|5.0|Brings the book to life. Good quality acting and wonderful period piece.  Jane would be proud.  Great rainy day watch.
B005MYEQ4U|3.0|I don't have much to say on it specifically since I purchased the product for someone else. I would recommend buying it since I have heard no negative reviews on it.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|Good acting, but it dragged on.  It would be better for a history class. I felt Tommy Lee Jones and Sally Fields did an excellent job.
B0089LT8Y6|3.0|It is not their best effort. Dont get me wrong these guys are the best at what they do, i just can not give them 5 stars for this one. Unless your an extreme metal head, i say pass it by.
B004UPANGM|2.0|I did not care for this movie. It was too old-fashioned, not interesting. I didn't even watch it all - I found a better and newer movie to watch instead
B00APJLFEG|5.0|This move was excellent the kids and the adults were loving it, I will be buying this one for our movie library
1616550414|5.0|I bought this book in order to find out the timeline that follows the Zelda games, but the concept art along with all the other bits of information make it worth buying, especially at a price much lower than in most stores.
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|This game was recommended at a small group therapy class for children on the autism spectrum and our 8 year old loves it.  He loves working with legos and this game encourages creativity.  A good investment for any child who enjoys creating with legos.
B005LHOKFS|1.0|every time I try to pick the dates, the calendar shows up momentarily and goes away. This is useless if you can't pick your dates.
B0049J3QF4|5.0|Never saw this in all the years it has been out it was great.  I will buying this for my library. Great cast of voices
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I don't know how this product is because it was a gift but as far as I know it's fantastic.
B00BWU2EMO|3.0|If amazon had it as rentable I would have, and regret not waiting for it to be rentable, because it wasn't really worth the $20 for the HD purchase. It was an ok film, but was too feel-good, do-gooder. The script was pretty meh most of the time and bad for the rest. Big cast though....
B00589AYWW|5.0|You'll learn never to be in awe of the powerful.  And to question the rationalizations by them for truly awful decisions.  Not to mention the outright lies.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|This book is sure to bring the reader out of the doldrums - a perfect antidote to some previous heavy books, in my case.<br /><br />The premise is that Mr. Penumbra's Bookstore is really in a different business, one that can change everyone's lives.<br /><br />Sloan has loaded this novel with a lovable group of characters, virtually every one a bit quirky. As they work to solve the \\"mystery,\\" we join them at the Google Campus, SoHo, all over San Francisco, and at some very mysterious place in Nevada.  That last one was a real killer for me. Totally surreal, yet Sloan's images were absolutely dancing in my head!<br /><br />There are lots of sly references and send-ups, skewering and admiring the technophile's world all at the same time. I doubt I caught them all, but they still had me laughing.  My \\"wetware\\" (brain) was working overtime. This book presents the true NERD TEST: If you don't identify (or want to be) at least one of the characters, you are NOT as geeky as you think.<br /><br />I didn't give it 5 Stars because towards the end, things got a little too complicated without that satisfying of an ending.<br /><br />All in all, what a wonderful observation of our real and virtual worlds.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game because it challenges you and it gives you prizes to get and that's what I like and you should to.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Not a bad song on the entire album.  They manage to take music that doesn't seem like it would fit together and make it beautiful.  Beyond the music, the lyrics are incredible.  This is a perfect album to hit the road with and just enjoy...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put it down! I definitely recommend this book to any one. I can't wait to read the rest.
B008YU0AOE|4.0|This free version is perfect for what we need on the Kindle Fire because we didn't need a full blown scientific calculator.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|This show captivated my attention from the beginning! All of the cast are well suited for their roles and give a very believable performance. The pilot starts out right away with action and a story that has substance. I recommend this to anyone that enjoys historical fiction.
B006GKHE6G|4.0|I would give it 5 stars if it had more levels.  It would be nice if they were even going to do add-ons later.  It is definitely worth the $2.99 I paid for it but it would have been nice to have more to race on.
B005HED08I|5.0|The quality looks great on my Kindle.  I don't have the HD model.  I have seen all of the episodes before but to seem them in order is very interesting.
B00BWJ7LYG|2.0|Boring very very boring. Lord of rings was alot more exciting. I actually didn't even finish it was so bad
B008MG1E4A|3.0|I gave this book three stars for its suspenseful story and gritty down-to-earth facts.  i wish the writing were better but than again Seals can't do it all.  Although in this book, they practically do.  A minor turn off at the end was opinionated politics and lack of the big picture.  But still worth it
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love exploring new ideas seeing interest of others and expanding from the world's goods. fun pastime pinning away. diversified selection of catergories to choose from. make sure to follow a lot of their suggestions of boards to get the ball rolling better.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Lots of inactive pole needs more active people but yet I still love it sweet game to play and makes u think of what to use or do
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I loved the season except for the ending...I totally hated that!!!  The acting is wonderful and the story line very interesting.Would watch more if available.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed his other book, &#34;Good Calories, Bad Calories.&#34; However, given its length and detail, most folks aren't going to finish it (or take as much away from it). Exactly the reason Taubes wrote this book: to get the message out to the masses.<br /><br />We're getter sicker and even starting to die earlier, and unfortunately, it is our &#34;low fat&#34; diet that is to blame. Refined carbs and sugar are the culprits, and we've been driven into their arms by well-intending--but totally blind and overly ambitious--researchers and public health authorities of the last 50 years.<br /><br />Taubes does an incredible job of laying out the case for eliminating refined carbs (including grains) and sugar from our diets. Weight loss is just one of the benefits of heeding the evidence he presents; preventing diabetes, heart disease, and cancer (all three of which have exploded since the &#34;food pyramid&#34; showed up) are also realistic goals for most of us, even with strong family history.<br /><br />Is this all crazy, radical, and far-flung? If you have a closed mind and an open mouth (to sugar and refined carbs...), then it might seem so. But, this book does an excellent job of presenting sound scientific evidence--along with age-old axioms, once taken for granted as the standard of care for obesity--that will, at least, have you reconsider the status quo nutritionally. Especially since it isn't working.<br /><br />Buy it, read it, and share it (if you bought the paperback version...the publisher won't allow Kindle sharing...sigh).
030758836X|1.0|I did not like this book at all.  The characters were sickos and not at all likable. I would not recommend it to anyone.
B005DJRD80|1.0|Figured I watch the pilot and check out the movie...what a joke.  If folks think censoring is appropriate, why bother having the lines in the first place?  This movie is not some G rated Disney film so why is it getting bleeped constantly?  Just plain stupid.<br /><br />Thankfully with this preview I can avoid the series and look for some other adult rated movies who do not censor their content.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|The war changes the household at Downton Abbey, even to the servants personal lives.  The family has been caught up in the busyness of caring for the wounded, which has given lives a deeper meaning.  The sisters are no longer content to just exist because they are a prominent family, but after the war, feel an emptiness in their lives. They must look deeper within themselves, even to the servants to look for fulfillment.

B004FRX0MY|1.0|The Amazon music listening and digital purchasing experience is characterized by one word, \\"horrific\\". Skip this app, save time, save the $24.99 annual fee, and use Google Music instead. Google Music is a competing cloud service free for up to 25,000 songs, and it just works. It's available from the Google Play store<br /><br />The Amazon MP3 app is buggy, clunky, looks dated and doesn't even offer genres for browsing through your library! Bluetooth cuts out frequently when I listen to songs through the app on my tablet. The app design says 2009 and it eschews the Android Holo design language for Amazon's awkward Kindle theme. The app starts you off on a screen where you have to select \\"Store\\" or \\"Player\\", and it doesn't seem to remember your preference, so you need to select \\"Player\\" each time you restart the app. That adds up to a lot of needless taps on your screen, which disrupts your listening experience. The app doesn't support genre browsing. You simply cannot use your music catalogue's genres. Don't bother with the Amazon MP3 app or Amazon's music ecosystem if you do any of the following: (1) purchase digital music (2) consume digital music (3) manage your music library (4) value your sensibilities as a consumer of music.<br /><br />The cloud service is clumsy to navigate is not truly Web based. You must supplement the Web based cloud player with several desktop apps to complete certain actions. The desktop downloader/uploader are equally as bad. Purchase songs and they're saved to the cloud and made available for free through Amazon Cloud Player. An ok start. Album art is 500px by 500px, also great.<br /><br />The rest of the Amazon MP3 experience is problematic. Album art from purchased songs is massive. A 700kb jpeg at 500px by 500px is gratuitous. Metadata is messy. Artists are not tagged correctly and Amazon makes no distinction between the Album Artist vs Artist metadata fields. Album titles have random words capitalized. Songs are inconsistently labeled. I need to re-tag the album metadata and update album art on my computer. So much for the phone app. Oh wait, you need to install a desktop app to download multiple MP3s, and you also need Adobe Air. And you need another desktop app to upload the updated songs. You also can't push updated songs from your desktop to the cloud (you need to make a list of each updated song, sign in to cloud player, delete each song, one by one from the cloud, then select each song from your desktop, and upload each song to the cloud. if you thought you could simply delete an album from the cloud and re-upload it, you're wrong.).<br /><br />Google Music offers a seamless purchasing and listening experience, is well integrated into Android, supports Genres and follows Android's design language. Google Music does this right. 25,000 songs uploaded to the cloud for free. Song management is almost perfect.<br /><br />The Google Music app starts up in the tab you last visited, so if you were in albums or artists, it picks up where you left off. You can purchase music, but consuming it is the heart of the app. Amazon's MP3 player emphasizes music purchases even though most of the app's users go to it to listen rather than shop for music. Songs I purchase from Google Play have tagged file metadata correctly (nice, Google!). Album art is perfect, Web optimized at 512px by 512px (close enough for me). The app has genre filtering and browsing. It allows you to randomize songs within a genre. The cover flow is very spiffy. I've invested time in getting my album art consistent so I could browse music visually as well as through metadata. I can see the effort bear fruit in this beautifully crafted app. The app uses the latest Android Holo design language, so looks consistent with the rest of the Android apps. It functions great and has a lock screen widget.<br /><br />Pushing updates from the desktop to the cloud is still a little challenging on Google Music, but nothing like the 80 steps per album Amazon experience. You can delete an album with two clicks. After that, it's 6 step process you complete once per batch of updates, whether it's an album or 100 albums. The cloud service is truly cloud based, and the user interface is elegant and intuitive. Like Amazon MP3, you need desktop software to upload music. Unlike Amazon MP3, in Google Play you can effortlessly download an entire album, delete it, or edit its metadata from the cloud, without the need for additional desktop software.<br /><br />The Amazon MP3 app is the opposite of Google Music. Go to Google Play, search for Google Music, and get started with an amazing music listening experience.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|... the audio/video medium delivery for viewing was so poor and erratic. When such interruption happens, I have to pause and wait until it resumes to play. So irritating.
B008602KQI|3.0|formulaic weak storyline just another in a long line of cookie cutter films about a group of misfits that end up in a fight to the death.the condemned was much better.hollywood needs to come up with some new plot ideas or the near future of movies looks to be very dull.

B00B7FOQCK|5.0|The Anker Uspeed 4-Port USB 3.0 Hub is an extremely compact and well-built hub offering data transfer rates up to 5Gbps. The hub provides a built-in surge protector and is fully compatible with USB 3.0, USB 2.0, and USB 1.1 devices. The 3.5\\" long USB 3.0 type-B cable is sturdy and supports PCs running Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, Mac 9.1 and above, Mac 10.2 or above, and Linux. Four USB 3.0 type-A output ports are arranged one port per side of the square plastic body.<br /><br />I found this hub easily supported devices using USB 3.0 speeds as well as older devices using USB 2.0 and 1.1 speeds. Regardless of what was connected to the hub, I was able to hot swap devices of any type and found no degradation of USB 3.0 speeds for the devices supporting it. I have had flawless performance in this hub for entire week I've had it.<br /><br />It is nice to know that Anker offers direct support for its devices as well as an 18-month hassle-free warranty.<br /><br />Note: Anker gave me this product in exchange for my honest feedback.
0307959856|5.0|I found this book at the library, without knowing anything about it or the author.  I'd never read any P.D. James before.  But I found myself falling into this mystery and simply loving it.<br /><br />I'm not a \\"huge\\" Jane Austen fan, though I've enjoyed what I've read of her stories so far and plan to eventually read all of them if I live long enough.  My favorite is definitely Pride and Prejudice.  It's a very special book.  And getting to \\"see\\" the characters again in this book was amazing.  There was great use of language and detail, and everything in it felt so much more realistic to me than some Austen pastiches I've seen.<br /><br />Pastiches are, to me, a wonderful way of enjoying characters you love, such as Sherlock Holmes.  If the writer does a good job, you get to step back into their world for a little while, and sometimes even get a glimpse of possibilities you hadn't thought of before.  If written well and respectfully done, they can actually add to your appreciation of the original, like a fine piece of literary criticism.<br /><br />In this story, I got a glimpse of a hero who was much more human and vulnerable than he sometimes seemed in the original classic.  I loved this interpretation.  I just *loved* it.  The characters appealed to me as much as the writing, and I didn't want this story to end.<br /><br />There was a muted, quiet, peaceful, and joyful feeling about this book at times that made me wish it was a series.  (I checked after reading it and was disappointed not to see more Austen mysteries from this author.)<br /><br />I really hope P.D. James will write more about these characters.  I know it may never happen, and that makes me really sad.  I want to go back to this quiet, special world.<br /><br />Oh, and the mystery was good, too!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best way to get the most fun and very affordable to outsource.Also be able to get the best way to play
B000FBFN1U|5.0|If you are reading this series, you should know by now that  the books are filled with bad people. Well nothing changes in A Storm of Swords. Great drama is unfolding here. Very believable plot as far as interactions go.

B007URVZJ6|4.0|Building your book for kindle is really helpful for a new publisher.It contains all the process from how to write, cover , uploading process, making changes after uploading and many more.<br />In beginning it is useful but not recommended for every time...because there are lots of things which are not covered in this book.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|LOVED this book. It was recommended by my boss so I felt obligated to try it. From the first page I was captivated and couldnt put it down. I find myself retreading passages and thinking about things Sheryl says as I'm dealing with my day to day work struggles as a women in a male dominated field.

B0070XFNDE|4.0|I think Shadow of the Wind may be my favorite modern fiction, and it will likely keep me reading every Zafon book I come across. However, this one seemed rushed, and the ending was quite a cliffhanger. I absolutely loved every page, but it left me feeling abandoned.

The Da Vinci Code quickly made me a fan and after reading it, I purchased all of his other books.  Anytime a new Dan Brown book comes out, I'm among the 1st in line.
0425252868|5.0|Great book. Great read. I finished it in two nights. A very well written book about heroism on both sides of the war.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The story line is superb. It depicts the class differences in pre WWI England and the lines separating workers from landed gentry. The acting could not be better. Each actor is true to his role, and each performs flawlessly. Hurray for the Brits !!!  They are classy !
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|I do not want to spoil it for anyone, but if you think you might want this, get this. If you think that you only need the regular DVD version, but have a Blu-Ray player get this. There is so much more, more Reno, more Cloud, more Zack, and more Sephiroth, pretty much more of every character, including Marlene and Denzel.
B000FC10WU|5.0|The plot is well developed and the suspects are many with lots of action that keeps one turning the pages.  Christie gives such wonderful descriptive characterizations that one can easily visualize each fictional being amidst their settings.<br /><br />How terribly dreadful to wake up one morning and find a body in your library......the body of a rather young blonde woman.  Such is the surprise for Colonel and Mrs. Bantry.  Mrs. Bantry is excited.....a murder in her own home!  As one might expect, the Colonel is somewhat depressed.  They both realize what the implications for the Colonel might be.  Well, what will they do?  They don't even know the victim.  The police are called, of course.  Mrs. Bantry also calls in her sleuthing friend, Miss Marple, to help solve the murder.  The Colonel goes off to the farm to watch the pigs while he mulls over the whys and wherefores of the body in his library.  Oh my.<br /><br />Then the body of another young girl is found in a burned vehicle.  Yes, both victims were murdered.  Two murders in and around the quiet little village of St. Mary Mead is a bit unnerving; however, they must be solved.  Suspects and motives are plentiful........ a dancer, a widow, a widower, a tennis pro, a film maker and more.  Miss Marple, the aging amateur (or is she) super sleuth and her friend Mrs. Bantry could get themselves into a heap of trouble with snooping around and  making really nosy inquiries.  Miss Marple annoys just a few people with her fabricated missions.  She is so clever at baiting and trapping ruthless villians.  Clues, seemingly unnoticed by the police, such as clipped fingernails, an old dress, and a young girls so called solo shopping trip.  Hmmm.  Miss Marple may seem like just another lonely aging busybody; however, she can be dynamite when it comes to putting the puzzle pieces together. She lives up to her reputation as a pretty good detective and helps the police solve both murders.  Surprises are always around the corner when Miss Marple is involved.  One can count on the works of Dame Christie when in the mood for an exciting  murder and whodunit.

B002GYI9C4|5.0|This series is everything this fantasy reader could ever dream of.  I am a picky and jaded old reader and making me happy is a task that is rarely achieved by any author, certainly not for three straight books.  The Mistborn Series of which this is the first book is one of the most satisfying and engaging stories I've ever read.  Brandon Sanderson is, to be cliche but sincere, a revelation.  This series meets every one of my exacting standards and exceeds my expectations. I want intelligent and inventive story. I want complex and memorable characters.  I want noble and uplifting themes. I want romance without raunchy sexual descriptions.  I want strong female characters who are capable of kicking butt when needed but who are also capable of loving a man unapologetically.  I want the invented magic and/ or religion of the characters to be believable and compelling while not mocking real-life faith and without delving too deeply into real life evil practices that are best left untouched.  This is a big bill to fill, yet this series fills every one of them wonderfully!<br /><br />The story centers around a people who share what is apparently a genetic trait which gives them the ability to extract superhuman powers from ingesting bits of different metals. Weird sounding? Not in practice. It's fascinating! Their world is ruled by an insidious dictator and his creepy band of priest-like minions.  This tyrant's rule over their world is so evil and powerful that it has affected even the ecosystem of their planet.  The &#34;good guys&#34; struggle to overthrow this government and to establish a more benevolent one and to heal their world. The author has an uncanny knack for creating ingenious systems of magic for his worlds (as evidenced in all of his other books as well as this series).  Their powers have rules and limitations that make sense and lend an air of credibility to what is an incredible concept.  You must read it to fully appreciate the cleverness of it. It is fun as a woman to see a strong, capable and sympathetic female as the main character here.  She is well written and complex.<br /><br />Since Brandon Sanderson is also obviously a man of faith (apparently, from available evidence, the LDS faith) he uses his creative mind to weave his story and does not rely on raunchiness to sell his books.  How refreshing!  While there are ZERO preachy religious themes, there is a general morality and nobility to his work that is sadly lacking in most other writers of this genre.  There is also none of the sneering anti-Christian references that seem to be so in vogue these days.  If you want an ingenious and fascinating read and you don't want to feel like you need to wash your conscience out with soap after every page, this author and particularly this series is for you.n as a woman to see a strong, capable and sympathetic female as the main character here.

B004W1GCNC|5.0|This was another series that was during WWII, with the big fancy houses in London. I thought it to be wonderfully written and the actors played their parts perfectly. Transfixed on the show,just like a good book I could not put down,I had to watch both seasons one and two all the way through to the end,non stop. I believe that all should see this series.

B009IEXKXI|4.0|In all justice I have should have given five stars to this very satisfying and entertaining book by Mr Weir.  I'm reserving the five stars for the next I read by him.<br /><br />Even though this is a science fiction novel, there is through out a sense of drama based on the understanding of the scientific principles involved.  I definitely don't mean you have to be an astronaut or a physicist in order to get a kick reading The Martian.<br /><br />I also liked the characterization.  The men and women in it were equally heroic.

Feature PACKED! Has customizable sleep timer, alarms to wake to any station, favorites, backup, bluetooth, search...and on and on. Can't find any flaws, nothing missing here! Got as a FAOTD, but one of the select few really worth paying for. Nice UI as well. If  you're looking for an all-around radio app, this is it!

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I feel like Suzanne Collins might have had a deadline to get this book out.  I feel 1 and 2 were more thoroughly edited and flowed better than this book.  However, the story was just as good and it was still difficult to put down.  One of the things I loved about it was that the heroes were damaged in the end.  So often in books and movies, the heroes go through these traumatic events and come out with no issues, mental or physical.  The heroes in this book seemed so much more real.  They were teenagers going through war, seeing things they shouldn't have to see, doing things they shouldn't have to do.... and in the end everything is not okay.  I like this especially since this is a teenage book.... The teenagers reading can see that contrary to many movies in books, no, we are not invincible.  There are consequences in our lives and with our choices.  And the story is just great,,,, can't put it down once you start.
B000FA675C|5.0|This is a book I can read again and again. The first time I read it I had a very hard time putting it down. Amazing read!

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The ending was a bit of a letdown, but certainly realistic. I guess most of us would like a happy ending, but while not sad, it still could have been better. Also wished that if Finnick had to die, it could have been more to it. All in all I thoroughly enjoyed the whole trilogy!

B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|Will try and keep this as short as possible. It's a Pixar movie, so you can expect a story with a moral, excellent animation, perfect voice actors, and overall a great time. Love where Pixar is going and all of their movies will be timeless, just like the rest of Disney movies.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|As a mother and career woman, it is very encouraging to learn about how other women are being successful in their careers while still taking care of their families. I really emphasize with Sheryl perspective of current women issues at the workplace and hope everybody reads this book and becomes more understanding of women challenges. My favorite quote is: What would you do if you weren't afraid?.
B00BI73CVI|4.0|Finally got around to see the &#34;Les Miserables&#34; latest reincarnation. The beloved master piece comes alive with great visual, staging, costuming and talent. For the most part. The central premise of the story is that life isn't fair, and this movie brings it home. Some people can sing and some shouldn't. Now, going into it you already know that it is a musical, that the film is close to three hours in length and that there is a possibility that you won't stand it. I'm in the group of liking the movie albeit with reservations. Hugh Jackman's Valjean is lucky to be a strong man because &#34;they&#34; carry the brunt of the whole story from beginning to end. Mr. Jackman's performance is well rounded and he could actually sing. Anne Hathaway is Fantine, she's got down the emaciated and fragile persona down so well, you know where her career is going. Her rendition of the dream song was moving and full of emotion. So then we have Russell Crowe. Geez. He must have been very constipated during filming, worst Jalvert ever. He reminded me of Meatloaf sans the facial expressions. They could've tried harder, but I guess they needed star power. Really, it's not like musicals are that popular. Then there's Amanda Seyfried, her vibrating shrills were just abominable, we know she's there because she's eye candy, or trying to pull in a tween base. The other singing cast was so much better that you really feel sorry for her. It's an ok movie if you agree to all of that, if not you probably can find a better use for a few hours.
B009MO57H6|4.0|Although I have only seem it in the theater and once at home (I made the mistake of lending it out to my father, I won't see it until the end of the year probably), I enjoyed the movie. I still need the anime dvds so until I can get them, I will have to wait until I am able to afford them all.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|I seriously love this show because of so many reasons. The complex character relations, the use of music, the overall cinematography, the dynamic characters, and the many many plot twists make this a thrill and a shock each and every episode.
B00BP4ZNFM|5.0|This endearing tale of a lost ET who finds friendship on Earth is a great family movie kids will enjoy. There are some mildly scary scenes for little ones, but not bad compared to what they see in a movie nowadays. The movie is slow paced compared to today's films and the special effects are silly, it didn't seem to bother the kids because they actually got into the story and that is worth much more than the super effects we get on recent films to compensate for the lack of a good script. This movie is perfect for a family night because it is good for all ages. It is also night to get some 80's flashbacks and get to share with your kids how life was &#34;Back then&#34;, this movie will bring back good memories and make new ones for your kids.
B000OCXI3K|4.0|It was an enjoyable read.  The story was interesting and well written.  Fun to read and then watch the movie.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I really enjoyed the first half of this<br />Book much more than the second. The second half was too much back and forth with fighting between the characters overall I enjoyed this book.
B00BF11STU|5.0|This movie is a great suspense film with a true story background, it tells the story of CIA agent &#34;Maya&#34; in the chase and capture of Bin Laden. The visuals are great and the buildup is really good in what could otherwise be a very boring film. We see the process of prisoner torture to attain intelligence, the struggle of the agents to remain sane and the difficult task of sifting through all the information they receive on a daily basis to be able to carry on their missions. I'm extremely happy that the central figure is female, and even happier that it is true! It is such an irony that some of the violent countries that engage us in conflict treat women like dirt and it is our women working along with men that will serve them justice. It is a well edited and directed film, capturing what's necessary to the story without going out in too many tangents.
0525952926|5.0|enjoyed readinf of second generation. great character development.  waiting on book three. i would recommend book two but book one should be read first.
B004UPALT6|4.0|You can't remake these movies, because what makes them so cool are the campy and cheesy FX. Personally, I think Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness far outweigh Evil Dead, as far as entertainment goes. Don't try to seriously invest in the story, just sit back and laugh!  :D

0380715430|4.0|When we read Bryson, we learn and we chuckle while doing so. What a gifted writer he is! From the biological fact of the larynx having dropped many, many thousands of years ago, enabling us both to choke on food and to speak, we are on a rip roaring tour of our language's evolution. The invasions, incursions, borrowing of other countries' tongues have made us a rich, highly nuanced language that is to be appreciated. Of course, we take for grated the oddities that newcomers find harrowing: cough, dough, bough being just the first to come to mind. But there are, strangely enough, reasons for the weirdness of the lack of conformity in pronunciation and spelling. The book will bring several hours (and the pleasant thought of rereading) for understanding this treasure which we take so for granted.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Being former military I understand the need to protect intellegence secrets, but this book kind of left me flat.  I have the utmost respect for all the US Special Operators, don't get me wrong, but I wish this book would have delivered a little more of the meat on the how and why.  I would still recommend it for any military story buff.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The show is great, but I had a lot of trouble with the download.  It would run for 5 min. then stop to download, run for another 5 min. then stop to download.  The 1 hr. segment took 2 hrs. to watch.  Very annoying.  Season 1 worked fine.
B0058Z4NR8|4.0|Mr. Acemoglu and Mr. Robinson have captured the essence of good governance through out human history and gives you a new way of viewing both the past and current events. The lens of inclusive institution in politics and business, unlike rose-colored ones, filters out the right-speak often obscuring the power grubbing underlying many proposals. \\"Follow the money\\" rings even truer than ever before. Thank you gentlemen!

B00992CF6W|5.0|the game its self is amazing. but for everybody who wants them to add the nether and the end you have to remember that this is a mobile game. to have all the Pc versions features it would be a massive app.
B00BJO5SXK|5.0|But listened to \\"Rusty\\" individually over 60 times. Tyler has grown as an artist since his last album \\"Goblin.\\" It shows in his lyrical content and rhyming schemes. There are still a lot of f-words on many songs, probably each one but that's his nature and he won't ever stop that but on this album, it's not overly bothersome. The album really touches on subjects like bullying, the album is really great. I'll probably listen to it yet again today twice, incredible work.  OFWGKTA!<br /><br />(Update: June 29th) - This Deluxe album is now in my possession. Great packaging, comes with a calender, poster and stickers. Love the album even more with each passing day. Great work all around.

1476733953|5.0|Just finished the first 5 installments of \\"Wool Omnibus\\" by Hugh Howey and am now working on \\"Shift Omnibus\\". I'm a long-time fan of sci fi, with Robert Heinlein and Larry Niven being my all-time favourites. With his comfortable mix of story, science, human emotion/character development and attention to detail: smells, tastes, etc. I think we have a budding master. No question - 5 stars! Now if Ridley Scott brings this to the screen, I'll be in line!

B000HL0EEE|4.0|With the exception that no one seems to be able to fight or shoot (not to mention how incredibly naive everyone seems to be), I had a great time with season one.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|I remember this album when I was 18. I still enjoy this timeless album. She brilliantly re-invented dance music for our time. A stunning creative leap into the dazzling dimension of \\"future disco\\", these new tracks captured the spontaneous thrill of the star's early hits. This album established her preeminent place on the international club scene. It is a mesmerizing sound that evokes and embellishes all the excitement, NRG and innovation that first set apart as a dance music pioneer over 2 decades ago. The entire CD is seamlessly segued in a classic dance club format. This album has been certified Platinum. Remember, this was 2005-2006.

B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Ang Lee is a daring and ambitious director and his decision to take on this otherwise unfillmable story turns it into one of the very few 3D masterpieces.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|It was good for what it is but I didn't enjoy it, it's just not a movie for me. I'm sure it will be good for a lot of you though. The quality of course is perfect can't beat the HD that amazon gives you!
B00APUQJLO|1.0|There are some very well-done films in the the existential/psychological drama genre. This is not one of them. After I watched this movie I found myself regretting the lost hour-plus of my life wasted when I could have been doing something more productive and I was relieved that I had only rented it from Redbox rather than having bought it.<br /><br />The movie gets off to a promising enough start, but as soon as the main character (who is a mutant combination of Donald Trump and Justin Bieber and just about as lovable) gets into his limousine we're treated to an hour-and-a-half of stilted, idiotic dialogue the range of which is limited to inane quasi-philosophical commentary on technology/economics and the main character's libidinous urges. The few times he's not ensconced in his limo (yes, boys and girls, he even pees in his limo) he's out trying to bed down his stunningly beautiful but strangely asexual heiress bride, who is apparently the only woman he hasn't slept with recently. And it's understandable, really, because she's about the most pretentiously annoying girl one might hope to meet, focused as she is on her poetry, which evidently springs from her navel. The only other times he's out of the car are for a quick roll in the hay with a stun-gun wielding amazon (he usually copulates -- you guessed it -- in the limo) and a haircut, which has been the actual object of what I assume is supposed to be an earnest existential journey across NYC, frustrated as it is by rat-throwing anarchists and a funeral-of-state for a dead rapper. By the time we come to the final scene in the run-down apartment of neurotic, feces-begrimed gun-wielding Paul Giamatti, lone resident of a dusty postmodern computer graveyard (complete with ludicrous port-a-john that dumps excrement straight through a hole in the floor to the apartment below) we're begging for some sort of action, any sort, hopefully the death of the aggravating barely pubescent financier tyrant. But we get robbed. The film ends with no resolution save the suggestion that Giamatti is going to blow a man-sized hole in said barely pubescent financier tyrant with a comically oversized hand canon.... if he can ever stop sniveling about what a failure he is and how it's everyone else's fault.<br /><br />The final nails in the coffin for this miserable excuse for a film are the little oversights in the dialogue that make one wonder why the script proofreaders didn't catch references to a windshield as a \\"windscreen\\" or to an elevator as a \\"lift\\". Certainly the chiefly European production crew would have had the good sense to consult with some Americans on the lingo, since the film is set in New York City? Apparently not....<br /><br />**SIGH** Now you know the entire plot. Now you don't have to waste your time. I should have known better, really. I mean, how good is a movie going to be when it's been adapted from a DeLillo novel? DeLillo, king of posturing psychobabble.<br /><br />My mistake.

B00BF123WG|3.0|Couldn't watch the entire movie.  Too much violence in the torture scenes. Decided after watching it for some time that I didn't want to know anymore about the killing of Osama bin Laden.  That said, Jessica Chastain was superb.

B00C1BUYX4|4.0|Can't say enough about Daniel Day Lewis' portrayal of Lincoln.  It was impeccable.  However, the script bogged down in some parts, especially in the first half of the movie. It was too plodding and while the historical aspects were interesting, it didn't hold my attention.  The only reason it had staying power for me was because of Lewis.
030758836X|1.0|I liked her style of writing but the story was not near as good as I expected with all the hype.

B0087GZ8YW|5.0|Standing in another man's grave is typical Rebus through and through, the plot and the interplay between Rebus and the other ranked police is not only rude at times and subtle at other times but it is always honestly put. Well done Ian keep them coming.

B0016PM722|4.0|I bought this lightsaber replica about a year ago, and I never got a chance to write a review. Here's what I think about it; it's super awesome! It is really durable, the sound effects are really cool, and it can last a long, long time without having to change out the batteries. The glow from the lightsaber uses LED lights, and, since they are homemade, has some spots. The color isn't too impressive in the daylight, but at night... Wow! Super cool. It looks really awesome with the stand that it comes with, and it's something all your friends enjoy even if they've never seen Star Wars. However, one thing I would say is to buy it new. I made the mistake of buying my first one from someone who had already bought it and it turned out to be defective. I returned and got the other one at no extra cost, though, and have kept this one for a long time. In short, if you are into swords, if you're a Star Wars nerd, or if you just like to collect, I would recommend this product to you.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Not that bad, but, they could:<br /><br />Make more blocks<br /><br />Add some tools and supplies to creative<br /><br />Make more mobs<br /><br />Make larger worlds<br /><br />And have some land forms like cave systems, dungeons, strongholds, ravines, and jungles
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am only sad that I have to wait for the Season 4 opening episode.  So many of my friends were watching it and talking about it  when it was on and I kept missing it, so now I have been able to watch all three seasons and I am hooked.  It is probably the best thing I have seen on television in a long time.
B0037B6QSY|5.0|This is a great introduction to mindfulness.  It is non-threatening, easy to read, funny and very unpretentious.<br /><br />It is everything I was looking for in an introduction to the concept and practice of mindfulness and meditation.
B003NS2T9G|5.0|This is a great series and deserves a watch from any true SciFi fan and any dr. who fans yeah!
B00B49L7JY|5.0|This is a beautiful Story. I'm from Michigan and never knew about Sugar Man.  This is worth viewing several times over.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|This is a very well written book and very entertaining.  I like the story line and the characters and think the author covered all the sections well.
0062238868|5.0|I've had my eye on this book for sometime and recently finished &#34;Sole Survivor&#34;  If you haven't read either - put them on your list.  Both are great reads.  I bought this copy right after I heard the news about Chris Kyle's death.  Guy was some kind of awesome hero.  I haven't finished the book yet (3/4 finished) ... so far its been a great read.  He even weaves thoughts/letters/calls from his wife while he is deployed
1451648537|5.0|I drank the Apple kool-aid and love everything Apple, so this is a biased review.  :)<br /><br />This is a very well written book and includes the good and bad of Steve Jobs.  If you are a tech person or like to get into the mind of an inventor, this is the book for you.
B00ARI9CDQ|1.0|We should be able to return apps that just don't work or just do not deliver what they describe. This one takes forever to open and the files take forever to open. I've given up on this
034580404X|2.0|I bought the Fifty Shades Trilogy because my adult daughters were ga-ga over the books.  They were ok, but definitely not fine literature.  After reading the first book, I skimmed books 2 and 3 and read just the last 30 pages of each.  I don't think I missed any juicy parts, as things kept being repeated over and over.  If I had to read one more time that the girl bit her lip or rolled her eyes I think I would scream.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I like how this works. Gives me accurate info on how much battery I have left and has alerted to remind me at different percentage levels. I did find that the calibration feature was not helpful. However, I may have used it improperly.

B003NRYMZQ|3.0|This seems to be a hard review to write. I had heard about Torchwood and when I saw it on Prime I decided to watch it. It hasn't lived up to what I had hoped. The story lines seem weak and confused. I haven't been able to build an affinity for the characters. The relationships between the characters haven't been consistent. I'm sure I'll invest the time to watch the remainder of the series, but if I never saw another episode I'd be just fine. Sigh. I really wanted to like it.
B00338QENI|4.0|Science, history, social issues interwoven to make a genuine page-turner. My book club discussed the many ways that the author could have handled the combination, but I think she handled it from the point of view that would not allow any type of reader to become bored!
B004FPJ87W|2.0|Watched the first hour and was bored out of my skull! Will try to force myself to watch the next two hours but I'm not too enthusiastic about it. The Amazon purchase and downloading process was perfectly fine.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Great series! I was turned on to it by a friend, she gave me season 1 to watch. I watched it in a day, bought season 2 the next day. I watched all 3 seasons in about a week I couldn't stop watching! It's like a great book that you can't put down!
B00BGD8CFK|5.0|I really like this case. I've had a few in my day and this might be one of the best. It's not too bulky and provides adequate protection. It looks good as well. Overall very impressed.
B000MVN8GK|5.0|I just started watching this show and I have watched almost all three seasons in the past couple of weeks.  Thanks Amazon for having season 3 ready and available.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its a nice game because you get to have your own horse  and you can play mini games with him/her  and you can feed and treat him/her
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Amazing movie; incredibly well acted, directed and shot - it's just a beautiful film and if Anne Hathaway's big solo number doesn't move you emotionally, you must have a heart of stone.  Great movie and so much better than the stage show - you get so much more detail out of the movie.
0439023513|2.0|Last year, I read The Hunger Games and Catching Fire and thought they were both excellent. I held off reading Mockingjay however, due to my friends telling me that it was an awful ending. Curiosity took hold of me, and I had to read it. Here's what I think:<br /><br />With Mockingjay, you have a different feeling then with the other two books in the series. You're not getting feelings of hope and excitment, but instead of depression and longing. Mockingjay tears apart the small parts of happiness in The Hunger Games. While reading this book, I always felt sad and upset; mostly because of all the death.<br /><br />The beginning of this book is what I expected it to be; devastating. Not saying this is a bad thing. In fact, I believed that the lower the situation got, the happier it was going to get in the end. I'm not saying that I expected a happy ending from Mockinjay, but I wanted some kind of resolution. Over all, the book was good. I enjoyed it and couldn't see the \\"bad stuff\\" my friends were talking about. Then I read the last five chapters.<br /><br />NOTHING GOOD HAPPENED IN THOSE LAST CHAPTERS! I really wanted my mildly good ending with everyone being fine. Spoilers!!! Prim died, Katniss disowns Gale, and Katniss's mom leaves. Finnick and President Coin also died for no reason. Peeta went insane and the whole book seemed to come crashing down for me. I get that it was realistic, but WHAT WAS THE POINT! There was no need for all that death. Then, to make matters worse, Katniss decides to make another Hunger Games for the Capitol. I though she would be merciful and let the Capitol children not suffer. I must be an awful judge of character.<br /><br />Over all, this wasn't the Christ of epic books I was expecting it to be. It was fine in the beginning, but the end messed it up.<br /><br />Thank for reading! I'm in seventh grade, so please excuse grammar errors.
0985081821|5.0|The Forever Girl will  leave you yearning for more. This is truly top grade Paranormal. You get a real feeling for  Sophia and know something is coming from the dark side  into her life as Rebecca Hamilton builds suspense around every corner. She's got a bag full of tricks the other Paranormal authors don't. Lots of emotion is played out here including, Romance, grief,joy, anger, and redemption. The characters were portrayed so vividly you could almost feel their presence.<br /><br />Rebecca Hamilton writes with passion as she creates such a unique array of Supernatural Characters-Nothing like you've seen before!<br />This is bound to be a real hit for teen girls.

B000N3T0DW|5.0|\\"Volver\\" is that: a Spanish \\"culebr&oacute;n\\", which means that the film is nothing but a \\"soap-opera\\". However, if all soap-operas were like this one, it would become my favorite genre. This is my sixth Almod&oacute;var film after \\"The Flower of My Secret\\", \\"High Heels\\", \\"All About My Mother\\", \\"Talk to Her\\" and \\"Bad Education\\", but so far \\"Volver\\" is my favorite.<br /><br />Raimunda lives in Madrid with her daughter and husband, Paco. Paco is lusting after their daughter, but why doesn't he see this as incest? Raimunda's mother died along with her dad in a fire, but why did her neighbor's mother disappeared on that same day? Why do people in her hometown still see her mother? Why did Raimunda left for Madrid pregnant and upset with her parents before their death? \\"Volver\\" has unexpected twists every half an hour with an ending that is both memorable and dramatic.<br /><br />I have to admit that Pen&eacute;lope Cruz is groomed so beautifully in the film that it is almost distracting, specially since everybody else in the movie looks very ordinary. However, she is the star and she shines not only because of her beauty but also because of her performance.
B001FB4W0W|3.0|I was so excited when I heard they were making the Sookie books into a show. I could hardly wait for it to be released. I loved the books. This show has very little in common with the books except the names for the characters. I was very disappointed. I wanted to see the stories from the books not a spin off. The stories are about Sookie and her interactions with all these odd characters. The shows do not follow the books and spend way to much time on minor characters.<br />Tara is supposed to be a minor character, as is Jason, and Lafayette died at the beginning of the second book. Pam was turned at about 19 years old and described as looking like a milkmaid and is supposed to dress in pastels and sweater sets and nothing like how she is shown in the True Blood shows. Eric is supposed to have long hair and dress with some style and we are told repeatedly he enjoys his undead life so why did the producers have Eric with short hair wearing wife-beater tee shirts and always looking so gloomy and grumpy and miserable? Jessica, who doesn't even exist in the books, steals the show. She is fun and gets into funny situations like losing the body of the guy she accidently killed.<br />The biggest problem with the shows are that Sookie, who is supposed to be the main character, gets lost in the shuffle. She is just another minor character in a show overfull of minor characters. I don't care what happens to the minor characters. I want to see Sookie's story not Tara's story or Jason's story. Frankly, they should just kill off both of them and maybe we could finally get back to Sookie, Bill, and Eric.<br />I gave it a 3 star because the parts with Sookie, Bill, Eric, and Jessica keep me coming back to watch more. I am starting to fast forward through the other parts because they are not worth watching.

Rowling's first novel for adults is set in the fictional town of Pagford, an area where the gap between the 'haves' and the 'have nots' grows ever wider with each passing day.  The Casual Vacancy of the title is the job advertisement for the election of a new parish councillor, after the death of the much-admired Barry Fairbrother, who keels over in the opening pages of the book.  Fairbrother, a working class hero, who never forgot about those less fortunate than himself, is one of the few characters in the ensemble cast, that you can really warm to.<br /><br />The local Parish Council are planning to vote on whether or not to cast off their troublesome dodgy housing estate, with its drug problems and welfare dependent occupants.  Barry was one of the few councillors to support The Fields, but one of those vying for his vacant seat, Miles Mollison, has different ideas and has chosen to stand, not for altruistic reasons but to keep the riff-raff out.<br />As well as Barry's devastated family, there is one other character, Krystal Weedon, who has been very badly affected by his death.  Barry seemed to be the only person in Pagford who saw potential in Krystal. He encouraged her to join the rowing team, which was the only thing in her life that she had done for herself. Krystal reminds me of Vicky Pollard of Little Britain fame, although there is nothing remotely funny about the way Krystal lives.<br /><br />Decisions being made in the UK right now around housing are being made at local government level and something that once seemed irrelevant and dull, suddenly takes on great importance when local government officials have the power to okay or veto large scale housing developments in what were once quiet rural communities. I too have sat through 'interminable, ill-humoured council meetings,' where decisions are taken that could have a profound effect on the local community.<br /><br />The town of Pagford is a microcosm of British life. Many of the characters reflect the current attitudes, which have hardened in recent years, polarising society into 'skivers' versus 'strivers'.  Tabloid newspapers make much of the rising cost of the welfare budget but you don't need to be an economist to work out that in a recession (caused by the banking crisis and not the poor) that those struggling to get on the jobs ladder and the over 50s, who have been made redundant and replaced by cheaper, younger workers, are having to resort to state handouts.  It is hardly a life of luxury, despite the relentless tabloid headlines of examples of feckless welfare-dependents and their deviant behaviour.<br /><br />Most of the 'haves' in The Casual Vacancy come across as unpleasant, small-minded and in some cases downright vindictive.  Samantha Mollison, wife of Miles, describes him thus: 'Samantha sometimes found Miles absurd and, increasingly, dull. Every now and then, though, she enjoyed his pomposity in precisely the same spirit as she liked, on formal occasions, to wear a hat.'  Then there is this apt metaphor for rural Middle England life:  'Miles, Samantha thought, was looking back at his father like a big fat Labrador, quivering in expectation of a treat.'<br />If Miles is a Labrador, then Simon Price is an aggressive, menacing, guard dog.  He terrorises his family, not just with threats but with physical violence. He is particularly cruel to his wife: 'Simon was seized with a brutal urge to punish her for intuiting his own fears and for stoking them with her anxiety.'<br /><br />The characters on the Left seem to be afforded more sympathy than those on the Right but even well-meaning social worker Kay comes across as someone who sees her clients as a series of case notes and problems rather than as human beings.  Kay is regarded with contempt by both her daughter, who blames her mother for ruining her life by uprooting her from the excitement of Hackney, and her ungrateful boyfriend, Gavin.  Kay, who made the move to Pagford to spend more time with Gavin, is callously cast aside when she tries to take their relationship further than the occasional night in together. Gavin, who can't wait to be rid of her, reflects on their relationship, thus: 'there had been Kay; clinging to him like an aggressive and threatening barnacle.'<br /><br />There is no doubt that J.K Rowling has written a novel for our time, in the way that Dickens and Trollope did in the Victorian era.  Many other writers have had a stab at writing the state-of-the-nation novel, including Jonathan Frantzen, writing about middle class life in the US. Where Rowling soars above her peers, is her depiction of the lives of those at the bottom of the heap, in this case, the Weedons. It is at times heartbreaking to read about Robbie's neglect and his sister, Krystal's modest aspirations to have her own house, so that she can take Robbie off their drug addicted mother's hands and try to give him a life.  Perhaps the subtitle of The Casual Vacancy should have been Hard Times because whether you agree with the politics or not, life is only going to become harder for those, like Krystal and Robbie, who for whatever reason, cannot help themselves.
0307383415|5.0|Barack Obama really lays out his life here.  His parents were not a big part of his life.  After his birth in Kapi'olani Women's and Children's Hospital in Honolulu, HI (Hawai'i had been a state by then for two years) his Kenyan father abandoned young Barry and his white mother when Barry was 2 years old.  His mother left him in the care of her parents..a white couple in Honolulu.<br /><br />His white grandmother &#34;Toot&#34; (Grandmother in Hawai'ian is tutu) was the first woman VP of Bank of Hawai'i.  He watched as his middle class guardians worked hard to put him through the top private school in Honolulu, Punahou.<br /><br />His mother remarried an Indonesian grad student and young Barry spent part of his childhood in Indonesia.  But here Obama is looking at who he is...what his ancestry is...who he is becoming.<br /><br />Wonderfully candid, filled with anger at some points when confronted with racism, Barry opens up.  He won a Grammy award for his  audiotape of this book.  He explains why he chose to become a Democrat...why he wanted to give back to those who raised him.  Wonderful book!  I have read and re-read it and given it as gifts.

Their album 'Night Visions' has also easily become the soundtrack to my life. The record includes upbeat arena rocks songs like 'Radioactive' and slow moving melodies like 'Demons'. I cannot stop listening to this band. From You Tube videos I have seen they are amazing live too, great stage presence.  I missed the band's tour stop in my area a couple months ago and literally almost cried. Lucky for me they are back next month due to sold out shows and more demand ( yeah, they are that good) and I made sure to get my tickets quick this time!

It is an exercise in empathy for starters and I can't think of a more comprehensive, entertaining, effective, and meaningful way to educate people about autism. The author's choice to tell the story from Christopher's point of view is singularly responsible for making the novel so powerful and engaging.<br />I'd recommend this book to anyone who is curious to understand more about autism. I'd also recommend it to anyone who has trouble putting themselves in another's shoes, so  to speak.<br />Impressive and heart-gripping, it will change the way you perceive things. What more can one ask of a novel??<br />This book is a grand achievement and I feel like I will be a better person for having read it. Thank you, Mr. Haddon!

B007ZXK08C|4.0|I loved the author's writing style. She knows how to lay on the suspense. I loved the twists as well. However, after being possessed by this novel over a few days, the ending was a huge anticlimax. I thought the last few chapters were way unrealistic. Maybe I missed character traits early on that would explain this. A great read though for those who enjoy thrills. It will get under your skin.
B005LAJ22Q|1.0|In several episodes the DVD would skip and jump and on the start of another it wouldn't load. The movie itself was great though.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|No spoilers. This book was so well written, possibly the best book I've ever read. The way the book came full circle, leaving no questions unanswered was so heartfelt. As the reader you really could get into the head and heart of each of the characters making them very relatable. Page-turner, emotional, heartfelt, life-affirming. Best love story I ever read!
0887081770|5.0|My little 2 year old loves this book so much, she'll take it to bed with her!  The book is small, a little narrower than a board book, and the pages are regular paper (she's ripped one page, bu that's fixed with tape) but the illustrations are so charming...classic Eric Carle.  The ending doesn't really say much, except that the moon grew back (it IS about the cycle of the moon, after all), but I think she likes the thought of Papa going to get the moon for the daughter to play with.  I do have to substitute &#34;Daddy&#34; for &#34;Papa&#34; since she calls her grandfather that, and to avoid confusion, but my husband reads it verbatim, and she understands that &#34;Papa&#34; for the story = &#34;Daddy&#34;.  Charming, charming story, I would recommend it for anyone with a toddler who likes the moon and stars right now.  There are pages to open for the full illustration, and a fold-out full moon page in the middle of the story that she likes, but needs help to fold back the right way.  Highly recommend!
B009AMANBA|4.0|The performances were excellent ... the actors really brought these characters to life again ... great movie about a defining moment in history.
B00BR476TG|1.0|Show portrays that you can worship God through several religions.  It makes a mockery of our one and only God.  Would never recommend it.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|This movie truly has an all-star cast.  The story is good as well and makes you think about how we treat those who are past the prime of their life.  It makes you consider what kind of person life has turned you into and that you can change who you have become by getting involved.
B000JZ68GG|3.0|Well this is NOT for kids at all. It is somewhat humorous and very &#34;sexy&#34; I guess as it seems to thrive on that even with the beginning scenes of Fonda bare breasted.  The &#34;space&#34; scenes are old and dated but that does not change the story line that much.  Fonda in revealing clothes and innuendo is really the seller for this movie.
B00BWJARHO|2.0|I LOVED the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Watched it tons of times when I was younger. &#34;The Hobbit&#34; on the other hand, didn't do it for me. It felt like a lot of scenarios from the trilogy were redone here with less awesome special effects. It has heart but I'm not sold.
B004SIPA4G|5.0|We've pretty much all seen this, the question is; &#34;isn't worth buying the special edition?&#34; The answer my friends is &#34;Hell Yes!&#34; The Recut is nice, especially when you want to watch individual stories like Marv's.
B002S45V32|5.0|This movie is an instant favorite of mine. I watched it once and missed parts of it due to getting ready for work, then watched it all the other night and loved it! I feel this movie is relatable to anyone who has attended high school. Molly Ringwald is beautiful and a great actress. Jon Cryor played his role effortlessly. The scene where he dances in the record store is priceless and funny. A+!

B008861R7S|5.0|This is a beautiful set, the pieces are all wood and the board stays right inside the box so that you don't loose the pieces so easily. The album itself is amazing and the fact that an instrumental versionis included makes it perfect for playing at work. :)
B003UBTX7C|5.0|Another good Camel Club adventure by Mr. Baldacci.  The story was full of intrigue and suspense.  I recommend it highly.
B008PQAPO2|5.0|I've listened to this many times since my initial purchase and it never gets old, I purchased the Blue-ray of this show as well.

0316228532|1.0|Sorry, but I stopped listening to the audiobook six chapters in.  How disappointing.<br /><br />I expected much more from JK Rowling; wasn't expecting fantasy; WAS expecting a well-written book.  Didn't much care for the reader of the book either.  Maybe her imagination only soars in the YA genre?<br /><br />Basically, she appears to have tried too hard to break out of the YA mold she created. Hopefully, she's busy working on another book, but as more than 780 people here on Amazon have attested thus far with a One Star rating, you can safely pass this one by.

0807014273|5.0|This book serves as an introduction to Dr. Frank's theory of logotherapy through his experience of three years within the Nazi concentration camps. This existential analysis theory is based on finding meaning to one's existence and seizing responsibility for it. A gripping story and a very educative and enlightening read within the psychology genre.<br /><br />Below are key excerpts from the book that I found particularly insightful:<br /><br />1- \\"The prisoner passed from the first to the second phase: the phase of relative apathy, in which he achieved a kind of emotional death.\\"<br /><br />2- \\"At such a moment it is not the physical pain which hurts the most (and this applies to adults as much as to punished children); it is the mental agony caused by the injustice, the unreasonableness of it all.\\"<br /><br />3- \\"Apathy, the main symptom of the second phase, was a necessary mechanism of self-defense. Reality dimmed, and all efforts and all emotions were centered on one task: preserving one's own life and that of the other fellow.\\"<br /><br />4- \\"Then I grasped the meaning of the greatest secret that human poetry and human thought and belief have to impart: The salvation of man is through love an in love.\\"<br /><br />5- \\"This intensification of inner life helped the prisoner find a refuge from the emptiness, desolation and spiritual poverty of his existence, by letting him escape into the past.\\"<br /><br />6- \\"As the inner life of the prisoner tended to become more intense, he also experienced the beauty of art and nature as never before.\\"<br /><br />7- \\"Humor was another of the soul'd weapons in the fight for self preservation.\\"<br /><br />8- \\"Man can preserve a vestige of spiritual freedom, of independence of mind, even in such terrible conditions of psychic and physical stress.\\"<br /><br />9- \\"The crowning experience of all, for the homecoming man, is the wonderful feeling that, after all he has suffered, there is nothing he need fear any more - except his God.\\"<br /><br />10- \\"Logotherapy focuses rather on the future, that is to say, on the assignments and meanings to be fulfilled by the patient is his future.\\"<br /><br />11- \\"What man needs is not homeostasis but what I call \\"neo-dynamics,\\" i.e., the spiritual dynamics in a polar field of tension where one pole is represented by a meaning to be fulfilled and the other pole by the man who must fulfill it.\\"<br /><br />12- \\"By declaring that man is a responsible creature and must actualize the potential meaning of his life, I wish to stress that the true meaning of his life is to be found in the world rather than within man or his own psyche, as though it were a closed system.\\"<br /><br />10- \\"Logotherapy focuses rather on the future, that is to say, on the assignments and meanings to be fulfilled by the patient is his future.\\"<br /><br />11- \\"What man needs is not homeostasis but what I call \\"neo-dynamics,\\" i.e., the spiritual dynamics in a polar field of tension where one pole is represented by a meaning to be fulfilled and the other pole by the man who must fulfill it.\\"<br /><br />12- \\"By declaring that man is a responsible creature and must actualize the potential meaning of his life, I wish to stress that the true meaning of his life is to be found in the world rather than within man or his own psyche, as though it were a closed system.\\"

B009NH6JRE|3.0|Okay, let's get it over with: Season 3 is far and away the best season of The Walking Dead so far. The show is about a post-apocalyptic zombie wasteland, but this season has gotten a lot darker than the previous two. I like this, and it's one of the couple things that really uplift this season. That and the much stronger narrative are the biggest things that uplift this season. That being said, the biggest flaw of the show still lies in its mostly poor characterization of its cast.<br /><br />This can be perfectly encapsulated in a season that takes places in episode 13, Arrow on the Doorpost. After Rick sits down with The Governor and is offered a way out of the deal, Rick is seen speaking with Hershel back at the prison. The following dialog takes place, verbatim:<br /><br />Rick: He gave me a choice. A way out.<br /><br />Hershel: What does he want?<br /><br />Rick: Michonne.<br /><br />Hershel: He'll kill her.<br /><br />Rick: Then kill us anyway. What if he doesn't? What if this is the answer?<br /><br />Hershel: Why didn't you tell them?<br /><br />Rick: They need...to be scared.<br /><br />Hershel: [Nods] They are.<br /><br />Rick: Good. Cause that's the only way they'll accept it.<br /><br />Hershel: She saved my life. Carl's...Glenn, Maggie...If she'd never come here, we never would've known they were taken. She's earned her place.<br /><br />Rick: Yeah. Yes she has. Are you willing to sacrifice your daughters' lives for her?<br /><br />Hershel: Why're you telling me?<br /><br />Rick: Because...I'm hoping you can talk me out<br />of it.<br /><br />And thus the episode ends. This happens frequently throughout the show's history, where characters are speaking to one another I'm disengaged from the moment because the characters are being disingenuous to themselves. Doing or saying things they have previously found morally reprehensible. Now, it's okay of course, for a character to have an arc and change over time. But in The Walking Dead people just flip flop all over the place just to provide convenient drama and fill the episode in between the action. Watching almost any dialog exchange provides good practice for being patient, because it's mostly a complete waste of time. Rick is representative of morality and order in a world where everything, including and especially those two things, are unraveling. No matter what the consequences are, he will never not do the right thing. Even if he struggles with it, he would never ask someone else to talk him out of doing something that is very clearly wrong. The best written characters, ironically, are the ones with less dialog or screen time. Milton Mammet, Daryl and Glenn are all pretty consistent, but for the most part the others are all just vehicles through which the writers deliver ham-fisted drama to us.<br /><br />Watching the show has been an interesting experience, because I've never really watched a show where I keep waiting for the writers to realize how much potential they are sitting on. It's good enough that I don't want to stop watching, but not engaging enough to fully keep my interest or make me actually care about any of the characters. It was sort of a system shock to start watching this AMC show, after having had the pleasure of watching Breaking Bad and Mad Men, both of which have writing that is superb. It's okay to have ambiguous characters, but just because characters do illogical things doesn't make them complicated. Sometimes it just shines a light on the poorer side of writing.<br /><br />To be fair, this is a show with zombies in it, and many people who watch it don't care about high-brow ideas. They would completely miss any subtle character development and working to improve the writing even more would just be wasted on them. The fact that as of now this has a 4.8 out of 5.0 rating is proof of that. But it's also good to keep some perspective. The writing is good enough for what the show is, but it's also disappointing because I feel like if it were to suddenly fall into place this show could be a juggernaut. Even still, if you can suffer your way through season 2, I'd still recommend season 3. The narrative is very focused, the villain is quite excellent, and of course it's always fun watching zombies get slices and shot. I'm hoping for more in season 4 though.re to suddenly fall into place this show could be a juggernaut. Even still, if you can suffer your way through season 2, I'd still recommend season 3.

B000FA675C|5.0|What's not to love? Challenging ideas, non-stop action, plot twists, all in all great escapist fiction. And we could all use a little escape now and then. Angels and Demons was equally as good, the following books maybe not quite so much. We'll have to see when the new one comes out.
